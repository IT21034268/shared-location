2,Not the book to read for the newly diagnosed....,"When you are first diagnosed with such a horrible illness and only know about the extreme signs and symptoms, it hits you hard. You need time to understand possible outcomes other than the chronic progressive cases. You need to go through the steps of grieving as well. When you first read a book such as this, you very well might think that all ms cases suffer as badly as these women. I am a fairly new diagnosed case and it took me a while to figure out that not all wind up unable to ambulate, control their bladder, have difficulty with thought processes, etc. I first read this book right after diagnosis and did nothing but sob, thinking I would wind up as badly as these women. Not so. It very well might be a good book to read cover to cover after you developed a ""thickened skin"" and come to grips with the illness, but not for us ""you look so good"" types. You have to be psychologically ready to handle this book."
5,"They've been there, done that and still survive","These women have a togetherness that allows them to support and assist one another totally. They discuss openly what MS is all about and do it with clarity, but more importantly with a sense of humor and spirtualism. They should be congratulated for their attitudes and companionships. A very informative and interesting book. Gives one a look into someones elses life who is perhaps less fortunate than the reader, but who does not feel sorry for herself. This book should not only be read by those who have MS, but is truly informative to those of us who do not, but may know someone who does have this MonSter."
5,Helps Family Understand,"My daughter has multiple sclerosis and I try my best to be there to support her and help whenever I can. This book helped me understand much more fully what she's going through. It also helps me more fully understand my son-in-law's and grandchildren's deeper concerns too. It's hard to put all of it in words I am sure but the women in this book really gave me a ""bigger"" picture and deeper understanding. It helped me a lot. Their stories made me cry and yet there were many times that their remarkable humor made me laugh aloud. It's a great book. I'll be sharing it with many members of my family."
5,"It's a sad, funny, truthful, wonderful book!",This book made me laugh and cry as well as helping me realize that I am not the only woman who suffers from MS. It is thoughtfully and truthfully written when the bitter truth is told. It gave me hope. I would recommend it to anyone with MS as well as caregivers.
5,Bravo-to The Froup,"Being a member of on-line support groups I found this book to be exciting and fasinating. No truer words were ever spoken when stated, ""Read this book, and you will feel among friends, a member of the group-and that someone Finally understands."" Finally someone has put down in words the discussions and tight bonds, that those of us feel with our fellow MS Sisters and Brothers. You will laugh and you will cry. You will hear of their triumphs, and their defeats. You will learn, and you will listen."
5,Awesome and Fun Read! I can't wait to read the sequel!,"Judith Nicholes has managed to put together a fun read which tells the stories of many women with many forms of MS and who are in varying stages of this disease, and all by way of their email conversations! The book is tremendously enlightening to family members or others who know someone who has this MonSter. I am especially touched by the courage and triumph demonstrated by the women as they carry on day to day life, finding humor where they might find sadness, and finding joy in the little things that others might forget to notice. However, what I found most inspiring was how they carry on with their lives as though having and battling with MS were an everyday occurrence, as though it were but a small annoyance that all of humanity must deal with. They quickly offer each other strategies for dealing with those annoyances, and go on with life. I say hurray for the froup! You go Girls!"
5,The reality of MS,"This book was down to earth. Everyone who knows someone with MS should read this book. It gives you an understanding of what we, MS sufferers, have to go through. It is definitely reality!"
1,Broken upon arrival.,"I ordered this just two days ago and was surprised to see that it came so soon... However my smile quickly became a frown when I barely opened the box and glass started falling out. Maybe someone will have better luck. In my opinion, too much money for it to be broken. I contacted seller and I'm getting a ""call back tomorrow"" at some point. Can't wait to plan my day around the return of what was supposed to be my husband's birthday present.Boo."
5,ReView oF Punk StriPs,"Personally, I loved this book. It is a good read for any anarchist,punk,or comic lover. The book takes a different approach to expressing some ""not-so-mainsteam"" ideas. There is some good old comic humor and some things that make you think. A great insight on the punk scene and humor of that category.*WARNING* This book is not for close minded people.All in all, a good book from many POVs. Oi!"
4,Good Quality,I do recommend this product to anyone looking for a sturdy brush. All of the previous reviews assisted in my decision.
3,"Very Large, Works Fine But Too Soft","I like this brush but it is really, really soft. I have a similar brush but with the plastic enforced bristles and that works better. This is really large so if you do not have long hair (past the shoulders) I would go with a smaller size."
5,"Phillips Brush Phillips Brush Monster Vent Brush - MV-3 - 4"" diameter",I absolutely love this brush. I have another that is all boars head and this brush surpasses it by far. It is vented so really helps with drying the hair fast. I have shorter hair and this works just fine. No pulling your hair out and gets a good grip. I have wavy hair and this brush does a great job in straightening it out.
5,None,Superlative production featuring one of the last century's preeminent music educators. Lenny's musical examples are superb and greatly aid intelligent listening of challenging music.
2,Not bad not great,"It is entertaining enough, but it is not worth spending money on to rent. I would watch it for free if I had the chance however."
3,Only OK,"Not a terrible movie, but it's a women-in-prison movie that seemed to have higher ambitions but fell short - ending up as a movie that wasn't a great women-in prison-movie and wasn't much of anything else either. The nude scenes were to infrequent and too short."
1,horrible,"It's a horrible piece of trash, which is where I threw it. It's fairly obvious why a guy would be buying a movie like this. But buying this is a big mistake. For one thing one of the ""girls"" in the show is a guy dressed up like a girl. They thought he was a girl so they accidentally put him in the wrong prison. Is this the kind of thing guys are looking for in this kind of movie? They say ""heat"" in the title but that is misleading. It is garbage."
1,Don't Do IT,"I am not a cult fan of this kind of movie. Not erotic, not feminine, not good. Intelligent, college educated woment who like erotic will not like this. Don't do it."
1,Broderbund 3D home Architect 6,"This appeared to a promsing product which I intended for rough designs of a house. However, my experience is that is poorly suited for this task and I would not recommend it."
4,Impressive,"I am a long time user of 3D Home Architect and I have to say this version really impresses me. The new layout is much easier to work in and the tools available allowed me to redraw a house I had originally started in version 4, in mere minutes. I wish I could post the rendering that I did with the software- so photo realistic that my wife had to look twice at it to realize I did it with the software. Broderbund listened to everything I wanted improved in this product and I must say I am definetly a loyal user now!"
3,3D Home Architect,"Have just purchased Bronderbund 3D Home Architect. There is a lot of good things on it, but several things that are wrong. Firstly it was not possible to register. Also they no longer supply email or technical support for it on their website. Certaiin things are missing, for instance part of the staircase dialogue is missing. There is not the setting for stringer waste. Also when in the properties page of any item, if you click on appearance the program crashes. it is ok as a toy for messing around on but without support I would not buy it for serious work. There may be a forum around where one can get solutions to problems."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I got this program as a Christmas gift last year and I read through the manual and I looked at the box. Brodurbund advertises it as having a great 3D engine. After installing it on two, not one, but two computers, I created a design, and tried to look at it in the 3D wizard. Both times the wizard was:1. Slow2. UndetailedAll this product is good for is the floorplans, which limit you to space. I was trying to create a large floorplan, and I could not because I was limited. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Stick with Better Homes And Gardens, which, after reading up on it, seems like an excellent product."
1,Save your money.,I had Punch software already but the finished graphics and walkthrough were fairly poor so I went for 3D Home Architect. What a waste of money. All of the actual design interface and capabilities are primitive compared to Punch. I could list the specific issues I ran into but there are just too many.I still went through the entire exercise. Read the manual and did my best to get around the lack of capabilities and aggravating issues. At the end I finally created the image. It was gorgeous. I realized I spent $100 to make a picture of my house and yard but that it did not help me much to actually deliver the projecct.3D Home Architect Dlx 6 is much like a Yugo with leather seats and a supercharger. You get the flashy extras but what's the point?Go buy Punch. Even Visio is better at doing real design work over this and that is truly sad...
1,Terrible customer support! Could not use it.,"I wish I would could have used this software, because it LOOKED pretty good, and Broderbund has a great reputation, but..Tried installing on our"
4,Good but not excellent,"I have tested a lot of programs for house design, and this one is one of the easiest to use, it is remarkable that there a lot of functions missing like copy and paste objects in the usual way , but it have the duplicate option (what im talking here is that some standarization is missing) you canot change the attributes of multiple objects, so you need to change the color of every single piece of wall one by one.Apart from theese little interface details, the resulting images in 3d are very nice and realistic, the product is discontinued by the company which is now selling all the components separately, so there must be a limmited quantity of copies of this package remaining.To end my review let me say that between all the programs i tested i decided to buy this one and im happy with my choice"
5,The facts behind the Nostradamus myth.,"At last a highly interesting and well written real examination of the diehard Nostradamus myth. A must for everyone interested in the facts and the history behind the famous ""prophet"". Very entertaining reading."
3,information is good. i am visual need to SEE to really understand this fulfills that need adequately,however there isn't any diagnostic info i wanted for my condition. hate to spend $65 a visit with different doctors until i understand what the problem really is. educated MDs do a lot of guesswork and then they do whatever they wish in your nose and too bad for you if the blotched it up. scarry.
2,Lovely locket with clasp issues.,"This is a lovely locket. It's the perfect size and shape, and people admire it for its attractiveness. Unfortunately, it doesn't close very well. There's a gap between the two sides of the locket when it's closed, and it doesn't ""click"" shut the way a normal locket would. It will occasionally open on its own. I've tried manipulating the metal piece that should allow it to stay shut, but it hasn't really been helping."
5,A Must Read,Just before the dawn of the new millennium I read this book. It opened my eyes and gave a wealth of information on Bible interpretation concerning Revelation and other prophesy. Clearly there has been so much misunderstood about end time prophesy. This is a must read for anyone interested in biblical truth concerning these matters.
5,"Kerry, the plastic banana (FAKE) hero.....","I find it pretty interesting that some of the people posting here prefer the trumped-up LIES of the ""hero"" Kerry, to factual reporting of an award winning (and former Gore backer) journalist...enjoy four MORE years of character-driven leadership-this book (and the President) rule...."
2,the Reeves book is better,"The book on Kennedy -- also called ""A Matter of Character"" -- is a stronger volume. He finds some of the many flaws in Kennedy and examines them carefully. Here we have a president who has nothing BUT flaws and Kessler is admiring throughout. What is he thinking?I gave it an extra star for its attempt to do the impossible -- that is, to paint an admiring portrait of Little George. If you've seen the final scene of ""Pink Flamingos,"" you will have no trouble swallowing this."
2,A Waste of Time,"It's no secret Ron Kessler is enamored with George W. Bush, however; this book is a piece of work. Gushing over and over about how Bush is a principle'd person and flawless made me give up after the fourth chapter. I have read many of Kessler's book's and have learned to accept the slanted right take but, this was over the top."
1,Not what I was looking for...,"I was interested in reading a fair sketch of President Bush. I did not want to read a book that painted him as a demon or as a saint, but as a real human being, with strengths and flaws. This book is pretty much a partisan ""campaign book"", where Bush is glorified and can do no wrong and his enemies are demonized. If you're a big Bush supporter and want to be told that Bush is perfect, this book will be right up your alley. If you are looking for something more complex, more real, I'd suggest looking elsewhere."
2,Its partisanship makes this dissapointing,"One only need to read the first few pages to get a ""flavor"" of this book. Those wanting a ""fair and balanced"" portrait cannot get it. The book does not even open with a discussion on the positives of this prez. but begins with negative attacks on the Clintons! Their source one supposed ""anonymous"" secret service agent who tells, as the author reports how horrible they are to white house staff. Forget what we know about Nancy Reagan, the Nixon kids and in-laws - let us talk about the Clintons behavior! George Bush has been president for four years and now has four more..those wanting to see what this is all about will not find it here."
1,"Bush's ""character""?","Salon expose - 9/3/04George W. Bush in 1971:Leaving the election-night ""celebration,"" campiagn associate Linda Allison remembers encountering George W. Bush in the parking lot, urinating on a car, and hearing later about how he'd yelled obscenities at police officers that night. Bush left a house he'd rented in Montgomery trashed -- the furniture broken, walls damaged and a chandelier destroyed, the Birmingham News reported in February. ""He was just a rich kid who had no respect for other people's possessions,"" Mary Smith, a member of the family who rented the house, told the newspaper, adding that a bill sent to Bush for repairs was never paid. And a month later, in December, during a visit to his parents' home in Washington, Bush drunkenly challenged his father to go ""mano a mano,"" as has often been reported."
2,A Matter of Accuracy,"It is certainly fair that supporters of George W Bush have an opportunity to make their case for him. This book offers a chance to explain all the apparent mistakes and inconsistencies of his Administration. As this is one of the most private of Presidential Administrations, rumors are more likely to develop. Other books have been written by insiders like Paul O'Neil and invited journalists like Bob Woodward. Let discerning voters decide which description has the most credibility."
1,Total bias,"How can the writer praise a man, who graduated from Harvest, cannot speak good grammar and always speak something wrong? How can people praise him a good president if he even does not possess basic common knwoledge of the world, such as the name of other country's leaser, the name of other country's currency? I wonder!"
1,Bush is a character,"not a man of character. The AWOL guardsman who put American troops into an unnecessary war that degrades national security, but, which, if had gone better, would have greatly helped big oil.The prez who panders to big business and the wealthiest while spouting hypocritical claims of faith and doing nothing for the poorest. The exact opposite of what Jesus taught.The guy who degrades environmental protections.Bush is admired by many because he embodies a strong, perhaps the strongest, trait of American character: self-serving greed. Covered by hypocrisy as big as Texas.A useful corrective to this book is Our Endangered Values: America's Moral Crisis by Jimmy Carter."
3,dispassionate account,"Kessler's books may not be spell binding or break new ground but they are reliable, sturdy works that focus on a subject and bring all the latest previsouly published materials into one volume. They are not passion driven, but fact driven, which makes them endure on the bookshelf much longer."
1,W stands for white wash,"propagandist drivel! This book doesn't even bother with the pretense of being fair or balanced. Norman Rockwell could not have painted a prettier picture. Except Rockwell had passion for portraying real life...Just one more example of the Neo-Con spin machine hard at work. And everyone knows that ""it's hard work..."""
2,Everyone ELSE must have flawed character,"Now we know that the dozens of insiders who wrote criticizing Bush policies must have it wrong, and thus lack character. The dozens of generals and diplomats who have criticized Bush military policies and foreign relations must have that wrong, and thus lack character. The 4,000 scientists who have criticized Bush science policies must be wrong, and thus lack character. The economists, teachers, pundits, businessmen, journalists... Well, there's just nothing to all this criticism -- it's all simply made up by people who lack character."
1,"Character, Indeed, of the Cartoon Variety!","If Elmer J. Fudd is ever turned into being grasping, greedy and witless, it will be because Warner Brothers read this book."
2,Slow connection speeds on my old wiring,"Like other reviewers, I love the ease of setup on this modem.Unlike other reviewers, I have not loved the connection speeds I get with this modem. I live in an old house with old wiring. Before my previous modem died, I rarely got above 24000 bps on it. With this modem, I rarely get above 19200, and usually am at 16800. I don't recommend this to anyone who has connection speed problems with other modems."
4,True Plug and Play,This Diamond modem product is what True Plug and Play should be. You can literally be online within 15 minutes of receiving this product (depending on how long it takes you to open and close your PC).The FAX feature is clean and easy to work with. With the $10.00 rebate on the box this is the best buy for 56k internal.
1,Bad install - poor speed,I needed my ISA slot for a photo scanner so I removed my US Robotics 56K ISA modem and bought the SupraMax 56K PCI (mainly because of the price) - bad choice. First off it wouldn't install because the CD-ROM is bad (CD part #75500188-003). Diamond has a fix for it but I had to reinstall my Robotics modem to download the fix. Now I find I can't get a speed higher than 26.4 out of the SupraMax - my old Robotics modem consistently gave me 41.3. I'm heading back to the store to buy a Robotics PCI modem.
1,ISA not PCI,"The box says it's PCI, but it goes in an ISA slot. I put it in my machine that hasn't crashed in 2 years and it locked the machine. It messed with my sound card and my NIC. And to top it all off, it still doesn't work."
4,Excellent Modem - Excellent Technical Service,"This modem is the most economical one that I have ever purchased. Under Windows 98, it ran at 48K. But in my case I had to enable the PCI slot through the BIOS. My PCI slots were disabled by default by the Phoenix BIOS. I have a Dec XL-590. I tried to install it under Windows NT4.0 (SP6) but to no avail. Even though service was excellent, the modem exhibited no response after installation. I was advised to reinstall NT4.0 and the Service Pack, but my system crashed. With a US Robotics internal faxmodem, I got 51K in Windows 98. The difference is not significant, but the price was. In general, I highly recommend this economical and fast modem under Windows 98."
2,Surprisingly ...,"I was so excited when I saw the CD sleeve arrive in the mail. I hadn't listened to The Halo Benders before, but assumed that with the brilliant cast it had to please. I would rather brush my teeth with a crescent wrench than have to listen to the vocals of this album one more time. Isn't there a process in the studio where styles may be appreciated for there creativity, but fail horribly against the standards required to make it on a CD? Come on, Doug. The music is wonderful, but the ""voice"" makes me want to drown myself. Didn't anyone learn from the Crash Test Dummies ...?!"
1,Just plain silly!,"I knew this book would be more a work of fiction, then biography, but I thought the author might do something fun and creative with this, with a real sense of history. Well forget that. This book is long on gossip, no not gossip but bull sessions the author may of had with some of the folks that knew Bogart. And like most bull sessions have little to do with facts. Might of been better if the author had admitted he was just blowing smoke out his hind quarters and called his book ""Lies about Bogie and other Tall Tales from the Jazz Age""."
1,A truly hateful book,"This was the most nasty, filthy book I have ever read. Well, I only read half of it and could not stomach any more. I recently removed it from my bookcase and shredded every single page. I ran the Bogart/Bacall fan club from 1946 to 1951, Bogie would have sued this author if he had written this before his death. For all Bogart fans....DO NOT BUY OR READ THIS TERRIBLE BOOK."
1,The Ed Wood of Books,"This is perhaps the worst book ever written. Porter pretends to have written this book through thorough documentation (from interviews, tapes, etc...). Hilariously, not only is he privy to intimate conversations, he also claims to have the inside information on what people were thinking...and not in general terms. This book also contains some of the funniest (albeit filthiest) lines in the history of prose. It's zero stars for quality and 5 stars for enjoyability. Truly an anti-masterpiece that will live on for decades."
1,Utter Garbage,"Ah, Darwin Porter. He waits until a performer is safely in his grave and writes pile of trash when he's nice and safe from a libel suit.The powers that be may want to take a look at the 'rave reviews' dated September 3/4 2003. They seem remarkably similar and I would find the fact that they're all posted within two days of each other to be just a wee bit suspect."
1,Wish I would have been able to give this one ZERO stars.,"At first, I thought this book would be an interesting and enlightening account of the early years of one of the legends of American film and stage. It devolved into a pornographic sludge where everyone in Hollywood was screwing everyone else, several times a day. No gory detail was omitted - unfortunately. This drivel, which also mentioned at length many other film stars of the day (again in gory detail) should be considered slanderous. The writer describes scenarios that in no way could be verified as truth and, unless he is Bogart himself reincarnated, would never know the thoughts that ran through this American icon's brain. Dreadful."
1,"Boo For ""Bogart""","This book deserves a zero. I've rarely read a more obscene libel of the dead! The author seems to believe that 99% of the people in the entertainment world were gay males, lesbians, or bi-sexuals. I doubt that the book would ever have been published if the author hadn't done it himself. No reputable publishing house would issue such a work of unsubstantiated ""facts."" Much of it reads like Porter made it up as he went along. How could he know the intimate details of sexual acts unless he was there? And he constantly quotes dialogue and conversations that he couldn't possibly have heard, attributing them to people who are conveniently dead and can't call him a liar."
1,A pack of slanderous lies,"This book is pure trash. It includes disgusting lies about just about ever actor and actress of the 1930s. Even if the trash in this book were true, it would be impossible for the author to have included it in such detail. He writes as if he knew every thought in the back of every actor or actress' head at any given time. As if he was there at every event big or small, that happened in the book. As if he memorized every word spoken. Not to mention that many of the things he has these people saying are so long and obviously written for the book that no person could have possibly spoken them in conversation. Don't waste your money."
1,What a (tawdry) mess!,"I strongly agree with the (2) negative reviews of this book!Being a huge fan of the Golden Age of Hollywood, I love to read biographies and autobiographies about 'stars of the past' and I am a huge fan of Humphrey Bogart....so I was looking forward to reading this book, realizing that it was going to be somewhat 'gossipy', but having no idea how ridiculous and outrageous and unpleasant this book was going to be!As noted in prior reviews, there is so much made-up conversation between the plethora of stars slandered in this book. Every page seems to contain a 'romantic interlude' and the author seems to have an amazing ability to know exactly what every person was thinking at any given time.Impossible!It was long, tedious and basically, pornographic.And yes, I kept reading it, hoping that at some point, it would conform to some acceptable standard of historical biography. Forget about it!Avoid this book!"
3,The Tip of the Iceberg,"It's an easy book to read, which can be used to get people think about their actions. I have used it to encourage my team to start thinking in other loops.The message in the book is very clear."
5,Take A Trip Down Sideshow Memory Lane,"Though there is not much in the way of text in ""Max Rusid's Photo Album of Human Oddities,"" one can certainly enjoy the sideshow walk-through that the book represents. All of the most famous Freaks are represented in this black and white photo album with a brief description of each special person exhibited. This book is a must have for any collector of Sideshow Memorabilia. Just find that perfect time (perhaps a nice rainy day), sit down in a comfortable chair, open this book, and imagine that you are entering the greatest Sideshow in the world. Everyone of note will be there waiting to awaken memories of the Ghost of Sideshows Past. A wonderful experience awaits the reader of this rare and entertaining book."
5,Beautiful,This alblum was my first introduction to Luis Villegas. I truly like his style. My favorite songs are New Moon and Baby Elephant. But I enjoy listening to all of the songs. I find this alblum to be relaxing to listen to while driving down the road. You will not regret buying this alblum.
5,Great Stuff! Full Of Energy!,"If you like OBE + JORGE (Sol y Luna), Willie and Lobo (Fandango Nights), Jesse Cook (Gravity), Strunz & Farah (Americas), The Gypsy Kings (anything of theirs), and Ottmar Liebert (his early stuff like Nouveau Flamenco) you won't be disappointed. Actually, you won't believe how good this album is. And the quality of the recording is excellent! :)"
4,A book I loved as a child withstands the test of time.,"I loved this book as a child and reread it many times. Revisiting it with my son a few years ago, I was thrilled to see how well it held up. Best of all, he loved it too. This tale of two girls at boarding school is funny, poignant, and on target."
2,It's boring,"This book is boring. It doesn't have anything happening. It doesn't describe anything that is happening. It gets straight to the point and goes to the next event. The events that are happening aren't very big. It's like she went to sleep on the top bunk. It wasn't anything big, just very boring."
2,"Not lullaby worthy - too ""voicey""","We just received this as a gift. I was very excited as I LOVE lullaby music, but the excitement didn't last long.The vocal ""talents"" are distracting on most of the songs and the music on The Sleep Song isn't peaceful but almost eerie . I don't find this CD quieting or soothing as I expect a lullaby should be. It's nice music, just not lullaby worthy.My favorite lullaby cds are Bless My Baby Boy and Sleep Sound In Jesus."
4,Some gems and one clunker,"Davidson is one of my favorite authors, and this selection includes one of his best stories, ""The Lord of Central Park.""However, I was disappointed by the title novella. I got the impression that Davidson was trying to imitate Michael Moorcock at his most ideosyncratic. The writing was sparkling, as usual, but I just wasn't enthralled by his point.I recommend interested readers to start elsewhere, perhaps with ""the Investigations of Avram Davidson"" or ""The Phoenix and the Mirror,"" great short stories and a staggeringly original novel, respectively."
1,Disappointing Waste of Money for You and Your Children,"The person who wrote the editorial review of this book must have been reading a different book. This 'reference' is so devoid of useful information that it is the only book purchase I have ever made from Amazon where I truly feel like I deserve my money back. It doesn't even list the Native Americans that lived in the state of Maryland, much less anything about their daily life."
1,My skin brokeout!,"These pills suck! I didn't noticed any physical change in my bust at all. It did however cause my face to breakout in acne, that was the only change I experienced.Does anyone know if they offer refunds?"
3,Great text-Poor pictures,"This is a fine book on the subject matter, but it falls well short of it's potential in my opinion. The cover looks great but the photos inside are very poor, almost like they were photocopied from a black and white newspaper. If you're looking for detailed photos or even halfway decent photos of the weapons of the Civil War, this isn't it by a long shot. So three stars is all it gets based on lack of good photos. Disappointed."
3,cumbersom reading,For those currently playing soldier with these weapons this is a good book to have but for the historian it has little real value.Cumbersom and difficult in reading.
2,Cool but...,"This product is really nice but when I've seen them before you could shake it and hear liquid moving around inside.. with this one there is no effect, and its also not that heavy."
2,Poorly made,"I had bought one similar to this one 10 years ago in a mall and wanted another one. This one is poorly made. When you open it the exposed edge is so sharp you could hurt yourself on it. And the inside ""hiding well"" opening is so small you cannot fit anything larger than a quarter inside. I was trying to save time by buying this online. Looks like I will be making a trip to the mall to get a usable can safe."
3,"Works, but ....","Looking to economize by eliminating a dedicated fax line for our home office, we turned to this product to handle incoming calls and route the fax transmissions to the fax machine.It DOES this, but ""at a price."" The ""price"" is an annoying ringback function that cannot be programmed out and that requires us to press ""9"" every time we answer the telephone. Customer service at this company is available only during ""regular business hours"" (i.e., approximately 9 to 5) and once contacted, not particularly helpful. One fellow at the service center delivered a short lecture on how this product worked, only to end with ""you'll have to press '9' to disable the ringback"". Great!Another annoyance is that this product does not work with phone company voice mail - had to purchase a standalone voice mail unit to ensure we got our messages.It does route the faxes to the fax machine as advertised, but the glitches make using it a less than ""seamless"" experience."
3,Multi Link,I am using this at work for a fax and a time clock with a modem in it. E needed something that would allow accounting to dial into the time clock to get employee hours. The time clock and the fax machine are on the same line. I found this to be a little hard to set up. You really need to read the directions (which are not the clearest thing to figure out). After some time messing around we finally got it to work.
3,Still trying to set this gadget up!,Very difficult to interpet the set up instructions. After I get it set up and it is working I will review it again.
1,Poor factory support,"Unless this item is plugged in at the telephone company service, DSL or digital cable modem, expect trouble getting it to work properly. My hookup was at an extention and whenever a voice call came in, there was a single brief ring and no repeated ringing as usual. Then, when the call was answered, there was a persistent ringing in the background as though the call had not been answered. Let's see, brief ring before answering and persistent ringing after answer.Three different local cable phone technicians were unable to remediate and the Multi-Link factory technicians could offer no help and refused refund, the unit has been shelved. Do you want it?If you decide to purchase this device, make certain that your setup is hooked into the primary node or that you can return the unit."
5,"Homespun Hand Loomed Tablecloth, made in USA, sure to please","Great quality fabric, lasts a long time. I also have one in blue color. Good cloth for country or relaxed living look on your table. Heed the warning not to wash in warm water or use the dryer at a higher setting. It can shrink. If you are undecided between 2 sizes, go with the larger cloth.I love that it's made in USA; let's support our fellow American workers."
3,Homespun Tablecloth is OK.,Was delighted to fing the stone and wedgewood blue color combination. It did shrink when washed but knew it would as it is all cotton. After 2 washings it is kind of scratchy. Hopefully it will soften up after a few washings. Laundering would be easier if it could be put in the dryer.
1,sad,"A great fan of Higgins, I have read many of his books many times. Perhaps he didn't have time to polish At the End of Day, perhaps it was pushed because he died. It's just not very good. The dialogue doesn't work, the Bulger/Flemmi theme is overplayed, and if it weren't by Higgins it would have sunk like a stone. And no matter what conventional {ab}usage allows, the old Higgins would never have used ""gunsel"" to describe a gunman."
4,"Not for everyone, but good.","I'm still working through this book. I loved the Friends of Eddy Coyle, but as a follow-up, this is less engaging, more of a slog. About halfway through it, I realized, as did another reviewer, that what this book is really about is the way the Boston FBI managed to justify (to itself) keeping the murderous multiple felon Whitey Bulger active, and allowing him to get away with whatever he wanted to do. That arrangement has never been described in detail that I'm aware of. So here is Higgins' take on how the twisted ambitions of the FBI agents and the twisted characters they needed to deal with could have yielded up a situation like Whitey Bulger. And it's worth noting that the book is almost entirely not only in dialogue, but in *dialect*. Page after page of characters either talking or thinking. Very little action, but when it happens, it's convincing."
4,George V Higgins and His Last Book,"The item we received is as advertised. Book is in the usual excellant condition. I suspect but cannot prove that the quality of the writing on Higgin's last book was negatively influenced by his health. He is generally the best practioner of Dialog is plot; plot is dialog but in this case his plot lacks cohesion. It is there but there are to many side stories that do not connect as solidly as is the usual case. But he is still one of the best in the business at descripting and depicting the cheap, venial, smelly underworld of Boston. If you read this, read everything else he wrote. When he is on his feed, there is no one better."
2,"Weak Characters, Slow Dialog","At End Of Day takes far more effort to read than a traditional novel packed with action scenes, and/or tied together neatly through the perspective of a narrator. Chapters alternate with two mob informants reminiscing about their own careers and about the guys they're having to set on fire and maim to persuade them to pay their loans on time. These conversations ramble on and on, over and over. The heavy New England dialect is frustrating to interpret. Finally, these aimless conversations come together to reveal an alliance between the FBI and the mob--I guess this plot twist is supposed to surprise the reader? Poorly developed characters and the dialog technique employed here make this a difficult read."
2,"Good functionality, poor reliability","I've had two of these watches in two years. I like the looks and the functionality, but the reliability seems to be lacking. In the first one, the sweep second hand quit after a couple of days. That one was replaced under warranty. The second one lasted almost two years, and then died. I thought it was the battery, but when I went to have it replaced, it still wouldn't work. When they tested the old battery, it still had almost a full charge. Neither watch was ever abused. Maybe just bad luck, but two in a row?"
3,Things to learn.,"I bought this instructional CD to accompany Juan Martin's ""Solos Flamenco,"" in my efforts to learn flamenco at home without a teacher. This CD is good in that it offered tips on developing the ""rasguedo"" and ""avanico"" techniques which Martin's does not offer. This is really good because just watching Juan Martin play the techniques is quite daunting! But Aaron Gilmartin explains how to approach these techniques and practice them. What both of these instructional CDs do not offer is the development of the complex rhythms found in flamenco. Actually, this CD does touch on the subject matter but not to the extend that I want. In all, this CD is good for intermediate players of guitar and beginners of flamenco style. If you are beginning guitar, I wouldn't recommend this as your first instructional material."
1,examples not shown in enough detail,This instructional DVD does not go in detail about strum fingerings and picado fingerings. This DVD is not for beginners.
1,Not for the beginner,"This DVD does not show or go over basic ""how-to""s. Half of the first DVD is devoted to the author explaining Flamenco terminology definitions. The second half of this DVD then shows him playing two Flamenco songs without any explanation. Skip this DVD set altogther. Juan Martin's Flamenco education material is much much much better."
1,Useless if you are 0 in flamenco.,"I bought this one and Flamenco guitar method volume 1 by gerhard graf martinez. The guitar method by martinez is incomparably better than this one because here Aaron just plays flamenco with basic explanation on the chords, but flamenco is not about chords it's about right hand moves. I didn't have the patience to view long enough into dvd but I couldn't find where he explains how to play rasgaedo. And honestly what the heck did he do with his left nails. They look absolutely horrible. I understand it's easier to play this way, but c'mon! life ain't about self torture...The flamenco guitar method by martinez starts right away from the technique of the rasgaedo, right away you start playing tango.May be when I'm much more advanced I can appreciate more this dvd, for now it's useless."
4,Sharon heads south in the 4th book of the series,"Marcia Muller pioneered the female PI sub-genre with Sharon McCone. For that alone, true mystery fans need to read at least a few of the books in the series. This book isn't exactly typical (of the ones I've read so far) in that most of the action takes place in a fictional fishing town several hours south of SF. Many of the regulars in Sharon's life are only seen in a glimpse but the new folks are plenty interesting.The mystery is both simple and complex. How so? When the killer is unveiled, it wasn't anyone I'd put on my list (the surprise) but I kicked myself for not considering that person (in hindsight, there had been enough clues).I listened to the unabridged audiotape of this book, narrated by a woman named Dunn. It may be a matter of personal taste but I found her narration to be technically correct but so flat in emotion that I suspect it detracted from my enjoyment of the book. I'll be reading the paper versions in the future."
5,A Gem Among Parenting Books,"As a family therapist, I recommend Dr. Roberta Gilbert's books to clients, as well as give them as gifts to my own family. ""Connecting with Our Children"" starts with parents in order to understand children. Guiding our children starts with thinking through our own principles. Managing children's behavior starts with adults taking full responsibility for our own behavior. Gilbert's understanding of the larger family system and the larger society in which we raise our children gives her a broad perspective that is rare in the field of parenting. The wisdom in this book could save you a fortune in therapy fees."
5,Christmas Gift!,"I was so happy to find this on E-bay-it was a nice cross section of ""Your Hit Parade"" music. I had given my husband the entire collection several years ago and we lost them in a fire so I was excited to find this to give him for Christmas!"
1,No five star here!,"I don't wish to break her heart But, I have to agree with the person from Tallahassee FL. The album lacks the element that Lorrie does best! I have ALL her releases and I feel she is not picking the songs that suit her. I use to like all the songs on her albums now I find I only like one or two really well and the rest is just in the background. Like I said its not terrible its just not her best!!"
1,The Worst Lorrie Album EVER!,"I was upset when I first listened to Lorrie's new album. From such a great singer you'd have to expect a great album, in fact it has been dubbed her best album yet. If only she hit the right keys sometimes it might be alright. It doesn't suprise me when in the linear notes I read ""Thank you to my new producer for having such patience with me on this album."" What a surpise. If you like ""Maybe Not Tonight"" buy Sammy's album it is so much better! I love Lorrie but this time I do have to turn my head in sham. This is one album I hope ""My Heart"" will get over soon."
2,Lazy Lorrie,"The minute you see the cover of the CD you know you're in for more Faith Hill/Shania Twain wannabes. Lorrie is a perky and pretty thing, with a smoky and original voice. However, this collection is some of the most banal music I've heard in country music lately. The duet with Sammy Kershaw, ""Maybe Not Tonight"" is maudlin, hokey and the execution is lifeless. The Jon Randall (hubby) penned ""In Bed"" or ""On the Bed"", whichever, is songwriting at its most banal. Lorrie has delivered some good stuff in the past. ""My Heart"" will probably be her biggest seller --- in the countless bargain bins of Sam Goody's or Record Town. Not worth the discount price either!Michael Butts"
3,music fan from NY,"love her voice,music and style. few years back thought it was great for her to do a duet with roy rogers before he passed on,,other night night caught her on the grand ole opry where she sang patsy clines old hit :crazy: thought it was just great. would love for her to make an albu mof some old county hits."
3,Average Lorrie Morgan,"Lorrie has a voice so distinct that she could sing the phonebook. The question is, why would she want to? This CD is definitely not her best, in fact, it is her worst since she has been singing for BNA records since 1989. Not to say that this album is horrible but for Lorrie it is not what we fans expected. The only good songs here are ""The Things We Do"", ""Here I Go Again""(which is better than Kim Richey's version), ""The Only Thing That Looks Good On Me Is You"" and ""My Heart"". Other than those songs, the rest of the album is throwaway. I understand that good songs are hard to come by these days but if you are going to make an album it can wait until enough good material is availible. Lorrie, we still love you and can't wait until your next ""masterpiece"" is created!"
2,Disappointing to say the least..............,"This Lorrie Morgan fan was truly disappointed with the material on ""My Heart"". To be honest, I purchased it the very day it came out and haven't listened to it since (normally a new Lorrie cd does not leave my player). ""Maybe Not Tonight"" IS the best track on the album (and even that is not as good as it should have been) - the rest seem to be missing that emotional connection. Perhaps this album was rushed; or the songs were decided on too quickly. I am still enjoying ""Shakin Things Up"" and it looks like I will continue to listen to that one until Lorrie takes another stab at a quality album of material from start to finish."
1,Lorrie has lost it.,"What happened here?? Earlier this year I heard that Lorrie has a new cd coming out...and I was excited because it was her first new album in 2 years...and then we get this. I went out and bought it and I was very disapointed. There is not any strong material here, the only good song is Maybe Not Tonight. Lorrie, give it up girl, it's over, it has been for a long time."
2,Great at first then the hard drive just died after 1.5 years.,"I got this after reading some other reviews online. It is a no frills player. In the beginning, it was great, easy to navigate around and very lightweight. But after 1.5 years, the hard drive just flat out died. Computer did not recognize it as a secondary harddrive anymore. I rarely used it except a couple times a week at the gym max, probably did not even use it for more than 50 hours. It was always protected in its case and never dropped.I thought it was lame, I read of a lot of other reviews where the hitachi drive died. I thought it was ridiculous to have to spend 25 bucks to get it fixed because it was past the 90 day warranty. Stay away from this player, there are plenty of other better ones with less problems."
1,FM Recording leaves much to be desired...,"I bought this device to get clips off of the radio, the FM reception and sound is very good, however this device falls flat on it's face when it records the FM to a low quality WAV type file. Is this some kind of FM copy protection ploy?Whatever it is, it sucks, and I am going to once again have to look elsewhere, but there doesn't appear to be any device yet that has great FM reception coupled with great FM MP3 recording, except a multimedia PC. If anyone knows of one, please let me know?"
5,Compelling Read,"I ordered this book because it was highly recommended by one of your readers in his review of another book..(that's one of the things I look for in reviews).The main character, Nofret, was one of the most interesting of any I've read. She has stayed with me. I find myself thinking ""What would Nofret do?""The book was lengthy, but I was sorry to see such good reading end. The same reviewer also recommended Byzantium by S. Lawhead, which I am reading..and it is also a compelling read.So, in keeping with recommendations, if you have not read Dear and Glorious Physician by Taylor Caldwell, it is a masterpiece of depecting St. Luke's character and the time in which he lived. I have read this one several times.Happy Trails"
4,Loved it!,"This is one wild story and I loved it - the idea she uses of who Moses was is just plain fun, in my opinion. I discovered Judith Tarr at the local library, just eyeballing the shelves, and she is now one of my favorite writers. I've read this one twice and will buy my own so I can read it again."
4,Radical project management,"Writing this review somewhat historically as I initially purchased this about 8 years.I enjoyed the first reading with some step-change thinking on progressing beyond incremental phased approached (especially for 2004 period) where I review this book from time to time as a refresher.Although I still encounter people doing projects who prefer the Waterfall approach, who would definitely benefit by reading and understanding this well worn book.CheersPieter"
2,Not pleased,"Although this book is good for those individuals who experience a very severe reaction to food allergies, I was dissapointed that it only briefly mentioned other reactions, specifically eczema. ..."
1,Cracked CD,"I received a New George Thorogood CD From Beaches Entertainment.The case was new, but the CD was cracked. So I ordered a new one from another vendor. I e-mailed Beaches and they said they refused my e-mail. It was easier just to order from a new seller. So Beware, E.J.K"
2,Didn't work for my Nokia 6650 phone,"I found this same thing at walgreens, although the micro usb looks like it will fit into the Nokia 6650 usb slot, it doesn't. And that's really the only reason I was looking to buy this product."
4,ill follow connie,"not one of her best,but i enjoy seeing connie.looking for love is much better.buy this movie if your a connie fan"
5,IS REALLY GREAT ALBUM,HY people//i waanna say that it was originally released in 1993 in europe..and in russia..the songs are strong musically and lyrically all of them just get into your head cause the melodies are catchy..especially good r politics of love all roads and moscow calling..i reall advice u people to buy this cd if u like really high quality music..see ya
2,"When a man feels thirst, he takes a drink!","What you have here are two lousy Elvis soundtracks from 1965 on one CD.Harum Scarumis a very bad soundtrack. None of the song were considered good enough to be released as singles. The one fairly good song is ""So Close, Yet So Far (From Paradise)"". The only other songs that are somewhat interesting are ""Shake That Tambourine"" and ""Hey Little Girl"", which aren't good songs, but at least they have some energy to them.Girl Happyis another bad soundtrack. ""Do the Clam"" was released as a single from this album, and was one of the worst songs ever released as an Elvis single. The only good song on the album is ""Puppet on a String"", which was later released as a single when it started to get radio airplay. A few other songs have a certain goofy charm, such as ""Cross My Heart and Hope to Die"" and ""The Meanest Girl in Town"", but they are by no means good songs.This CD will be of interest only to Elvis fans who have to have everything that the King ever recorded."
5,Back to School is action-packed grossness!,"Bone Chillers is super rad, and strikes again with one of the best episodes ever!! A new kitchen lady comes to Edgar Allen Poe High, and attempts to destroy the entire student body with her alluring yet destructive food. Only our four heroes Fitz, Brian, Sarah, and Lexie can figure out what's going on in the kitchen, and stop the fiendish cafeteria lady from destroying their school and all the students in it! Awesome stuff, but don't watch it while eating!!"
5,"Wright, Wyoming","Before 1976, Wright, Wyoming, didn't exist. But because of OPEC and high oil prices in the early 1970's, clean burning coal became a feasible option in our energy policies. In the Powder River Basin lies a huge area of coal, but few people live close enough to it to work it. So the town of Wright was created.The book studies the problems of building a new town from scratch - the cost of housing, services, etc. Trailer parks, which do not foster permanence, were not to be the way for Wright. It is a well-established town now, but its existence depends on a single product, a fickle one at that. If and how long Wright exists is for the future to decide. (With the price of oil at all-time highs right now, Wright's future looks bright indeed). A well-written and insightful book."
5,Lotz of Rock!!,"If you love rock songs, you have to pick up this c.d. There's also some slow songs and a few orchestral! Trust me, you haven't heard anything this good! :) ;) :)!! My favorites include: Fortune and Fame, My Way (Remix), Uptown Girl, Ain't No Fak'n The Funk, and Life is Good..:Caitlin:."
1,Poorly mastered...,"The problem with this CD is that whoever did the mastering didn't know how to insert track-markings. If you are scanning through the disc, you might think that the introductions of many songs have been cut off. What has happened is that [...] Arista placed most of the track markings AFTER songs have started (You have to back-up and listen to the end of a previous track in order to hear the beginning of the next one).Naturally, if you play the CD from start to finish, you'll never notice this problem.This is really sad because the quality of the sound is very good, and the CD is probably the best representation of Warwick's work. But I wouldn't recommend this disc because of the technical flaw."
2,Great songs...poor recording/digital transfer work,This should be a fantastic music set...but once you listen...you will notice that there is something wrong with the cut-offs & beginnings of the songs when played in shuffle mode.This is simply unacceptable and does a tremendous disservice to Ms Warwick...a true icon whose work should never have been presented in such a sloppy fashion.It seems as if it was not edited at all.Definitely two thumbs down for the editing...thumbs up for the compilation.
4,Nice walk down memory lane.,I purchased this CD because I loved D. Warwick growning up. I liked the songs on the CD and it brought back pleasant memories. A good sing along type grouping.
3,Intelligent Writing,"This collection of short stories isn't the best collection of Martin Amis' work, but the book is worth the price purely for the introduction. The short stories are interesting reading, and provide some good discussion points, but the introduction.... The introduction is probably one of the best pieces of writing I have ever read. Period. Chilling, intelligent, and will make you think, and think a bit more."
2,"Excellent intro, boring stories","The introduction, which is nearly one third of the slim book, is excellent; the first two stories are compelling and interesting, ""Bujak"" and ""Insight"". The attempts at science fiction are embarassing at best and pretentious and patronizing at worst. I'm a fan of all fiction that references our nuclear predicament; just this weekend I visited an abandoned Nike missile base in New Jersey, that was meant to protect against intercontinental bomber attacks, but this book failed to grip me. At ... dollars it's practically an insult. If you must read it, get a used copy."
3,Ronaldus Magnus Triumphed After All,"And here we are in 2011, and not a peep from Mr. Amis on our current troubles with jihadists; the latest chapter of a savage 1400 year conflict between freedom and submission troubles him not at all. And as for the blather about the ""Brilliant Introduction,"" the reason for being of this collection?Well, Ronaldus Magnus got it right, and the Soviets fell, despite Amis' disbelieving bleatings. The major problem today is the Mullahs in Teheran getting the bomb, and on that subject Amis is...silent."
1,patriots beat you bad....,...you need help from god to deal with the beat down the pats put on you in the snow.
1,Sports Authority Rooftop Santa purchases,"The online purchuse was very simple (both times). However, the product was broken when I received it (both times). I have returned the first one and only received a partial refund. They did not refund the S&H. I disagree with this as it is not my fault that it was broken. I still need this product but I have already spent $11.98 on S&H with no product to show for this purchase."
4,Carolina Hurricanes License Plate,My husband has wanted a Hurricanes license plate for some time and was extremely happy with receiving this one for Xmas.
3,where are the rest of the songs???,"having just seen the musical in new york, i was anticipating much more when i purchased the cd. granted, what was actually on the recording was great, but where are the selections from cabaret, damn yankees, etc????? i especially missed cabaret's ""mein herr."""
4,"slight dissapointment, but a good compilation","Although the music could be better and there are quite a few weaker numbers, this is a great compilation of songs from Fosse shows. A lot of stuff from ""All That JAzz"" and ""Dancin' "" makes it like having bought 2 or 3 cds in one. If you're a big fan of his work, this would be nice to have, or if you really enjoyed the show, but otherwise, not a nescessary addition to any showtune collection---------"
2,FOSSE IS A TERRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT,"If you're a fan of musicals, and enjoy the work of Bob Fosse, you are probably better off seeing the show FOSSE to witness the fine work of Ann Reinking, who recreated much of the choreography, than you are listening to the Original Cast Album. This is a terrible disappointment, destined to be useful in dance classes, but not an especially fine addition to your collection of show music.The performances seem stilted and mediocre on CD. There's more life in a FORBIDDEN BROADWAY rendition of Fosse's work.If you want an exciting, imaginative recording of a Bob Fosse musical, get any of the albums starring Gwen Verdon or the revival of CHICAGO instead!"
4,Missing SONGS!,"Fosse is enjoyable, but the CD is missing songs, where is Cabret and Pippin? Also some songs didn't translate to CD, such as Bye Bye Blackbird, but for the most part the CD is nice to listen to, but only buy if your a broadway collector."
4,Fosse:Original Broadway Cast Recording,"Suprisingly this recording is truly alive with the nuances and trebles of a live performance. The cast voices are superbly skilled. The energy oozes out of the CD player as FOSSE performers articulate each note and word of the songs. Favorites: Crunchy Granola Suite, Hey Big Spender and the insturmentals."
4,Close your eyes and let it take you away,"As a stand alone recording, Fosse: A Celebration in Song and Dance would appear quite week without the visual aspect of the show. Unlike other Original Broadway Cast Recordings, the music selections here neither make the story progress - as there is none - nor translate the essence of the show.However, if you have seen the show, you will smile widely while listening to the recording. Jane Lanier, Michael Paternostro and Alex Sanchez (Steam Heat) transpose quite well on CD, and so does Big Spender and Mr. Bojangles. But nothing compares to the dazzling rendition of the ""Big Deal"" classic, Life's a Bowl of Cherries, performed by the stellar, beautiful, talented and gracious Valarie Pettiford, who, with this performance may have failed to snag a Tony, but solidified the strong hold she has on her fan's admiration and won the heart of a new generation of spectators who had yet to discover the wonder that is Ms. Pettiford."
1,Who Forgot To Tell Them About Singing Dancers?,"What almost seems like a feeble attempt to capture the musicality of songs that were popular in the 70's and 80's ""Fosse"" is what I like to call just a group of dancers trying to sing. Not since ""A Chorus Line"" has such a musically embarrassing album been produced. The arrangements are filled with underlying tones of funk and ""ancient"" synthesizer sounds. Not one of the cast members seems to be able to hold their own vocally. The cast of ""Fosse"" should keep their music in the theater, where I'm hoping (for their sake) it sounds more convincing live."
4,One of the best musicals!,"The only reason this CD didn't get 5 stars is because the musical is just as much, or more, visual. The music is great though. Big Spender, Rich Man's Frug and Sing Sing Sing are the best songs on there. If you like the music, you have to see it live."
3,Notes from a Brazilian Bob Fosse's Fan,"In my opinion people who like Bob Fosse feel fascinated with the energy of Fosse's numbers. His greatest point is the vibration, the sensuality and how we get involved by that ""celebration in song and dance"". The cd is ok, but there's a tremendous lack of life. It was supposed to be the best cd I'd ever bought, but it's a little disappointing. Where's Cabaret? All That Jazz? Oh God! Fosse has such wonderful moments that could have been figuring in this album...Thanx it counts on Big Spender, Rich Man's Frug and Sing! Sing! Sing!. But I can't stop wondering...Dear God!!! Where's Mein Herr?!?!?! Can you think about FOSSE and simply forget Mein Herr? I can't stand this. Ok, it's a good cd, but you gotta really love Fosse. Only this way you'll manage the absence of some unforgettable numbers..."
3,Bland,"The stage production was fantastic; the CD is just OK. It doesn't have any of the energy of the show. If you like the music, you'd be better off getting the OBC CDs from which these songs were taken, especially Sweet Charity and Cabaret."
1,WHERE ARE ALL THE SONGS?,"No CABERET, no DAMN YANKEES, no PIPPIN - what IS this album - they have CHICAGO, but the bad songs - not even ALL THAT JAZZ. They chose BAD songs for this CD - the only one which I thought really showcased Fosse's best known was BIG SPENDER. Whoever made this compilation had no brains."
5,Revelation what an awesome study.,"This was a chosen commentary during a Bible study, it is a good commentary but my preference is KJ, but other wise it is a good study guide."
4,Meter,This second edition is an excellent reference for digital and muli metering. i would recommend it as part of a electronics library.
4,Delightful,"A delightfully comic yarn by a master story teller, Whisky Galore tracks the effects of a whisky shortage, and then a whisky surplus, on the fictional islands of Great and Little Todday, in the Scottish Hebrides, during World War II. A tale told with a tremendous love for the people and the heritage of the Hebrides. Highly recommended."
4,good amusing sea tale of the scottish hebrides,"This is an outrageous story set in the Scottish Hebrides. Two rival islands suffer a lack of any drink due to the conditions caused by the war (WW2). This unfathomable hardship is providentially relieved by the running aground of a ship laden with (what else?) whiskey. Drinking is not this funny any more, so the light treatment it gets here is refreshing. Ha"
4,Whisky Galore,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel. As has been stated in the other reviews, the story is based on a true event that occured during the Second World War. I found MacKenzies development of tension leading up to the wreck to be masterful, but think that the story began to unravel once the ship found itself on the rocks, so to speak, and was being looted. Still, it is a great read, and have recommended the book to others in the past, and do so here as well."
5,Daughter likes this one alot!,"This book is for all you diehard Blues Clues fans! My 3 year old still likes Blues Clues..even tho Bob the Builder is around and Rollie Pollie Ollie! Heck, I like them too! So..go ahead..buy this book!"
3,Michelle Johnson is Danielle/Chelsea,"During the ten years that followed her successful debut as a hot teenager in ""Blame It On Rio"" opposite Michael Caine (1984), Michelle Johnson didn't seem to get lucky on any role she landed (including her double role in this not-so-cool thriller). Then she got married to baseball star Matt Williams in early 1999 and was given another chance in ""Fallen Angel"" (aka ""Revenge"") opposite Alexandra Paul, which turned out a surprisingly entertaining thriller. That being said, I suggest you check out ""Fallen Angel"" and enjoy Michelle's acting, unless you're more into her other assets (in that case, ""Blame It On Rio"" remains an all-time treat to the eyes)."
2,"There seems to be two different kits, or the description is wrong.","There seems to be two different kits with this name, or the description is wrong. The description said it contained a 24 page activity booklet and a lodestone among the other stuff. Other reviewers said theirs did not come with a booklet. Mine came with a 13 page booklet, but only 4 of those pages are in English. It also did not come with a lodestone."
4,"Good supplies, needs separate guidance","We got this kit for our daughter, and we already had a book of science experiments. The kit itself does not include anything of the sort. It is a good collection of magnetism supplies, although some experiments would work better with a stronger magnet than any included. Regardless, it is an excellent set for the price."
4,"Lots of fun, but not exactly as described","Like other reviewers said, this kit did not come with the descibed/pictured book, or with a lodestone. I don't care about the book because we already have an Usborne experiment book, which is what I ordered this set for. I would have liked the lodestone, though. Even so, the magnets are high quality, and the set is a good value. Both my sons have been enjoying playing and experimenting."
3,Fun weekend read if you are a movie buff.,"I enjoyed this book if, for nothing more than it is refreshing to read something that doesn't extoll the cinematic masterpiece all film books seem to call their subjects.While some of the choices may seem harsh, I must agree with most of them, (I will even admit to hating myself for the fact I can watch Grease 2, even though it is an undeniably bad film!) and some just made me cackle with delight. (The chapter on 'A Star is Born' is chock full of painful truth!) And I was surprised to find some films in there (The 10 Commandments...but I like his arguments).I recommend this book for an enjoyable read, but not as a serious film reference."
3,"Good,could be better","Michael Sauter rounds up the usual suspects here-""Ishtar"",""Xanadu"",""Heaven's Gate"",in fact,if you've read any of the Medved books,there's really no need to read this one,since it covers much of the same territory.You could quibble with some of his choices,for instance,he seems to have a thing against Bible movies.(Frankly,I find them just boring,not ""Bad"".)He even has the gall to pick on Jack Webb's movie ""The D.I.""!Come on now,that movie is a camp classic!The search for a murdered sand flea is priceless!I do give him credit,though,for including ""Manos-The Left Hand of God"" in his book.Believe me,this movie is appallingly bad!Next to this,""Plan 9"" looks like ""Gone with the Wind."""
4,Great Suspense Read,"In this debut novel by Cynthia Hickey, the reader is left breathless at times.....truly believable characters and interesting plot with a faith line intricately woven in so that the book isn't ""preachy"".....I'd recommend this book to anyone who loves a good suspense read! For more of my reviews, visit my website at www.robinmillerbooks.com"
4,Packed with Action,"PURSUED BY EVIL is Cynthia Hickey's debut novel. The story flows quickly and imagery is perfect. It is an impressive start to her career. The ending is packed with action and proves to be one of the book's most dramatic scenes. It did seem to be left open for a sequel, and I hope the author is planning to return readers to Felicia's world. - RoundTableReviews"
4,good martial arts,"not a bad show for the date it was made, but with Don the Dragon in it will be a plus"
5,"Great book from which the movie ""The Paper Chase"" was based","Great book from which the movie ""The Paper Chase"" was based.Great Seller!!! No problems. Item as described. Will buy from this seller again!!! A+++++++"
3,American Reading Instruction,"As required text books go, this wasn't too bad. The author overused citations and they were printed in smaller type that was challenging to read. The subject matter was fairly interesting but the citations were often distracting rather than enhancing."
1,sounds like every thing else no originality,"I think that you need to be more creative and try useing other instruments other then remixing someone elses back beat...... hey let's try a xylephone or something that is'nt the every day norm.... and you need better looking women in the video- who's walking who , I saw the collar.."
4,Excellent teaching tool for 1st grade money math,"Pre-professional teacher here; I used this book to open up a money lesson with a 1st grade class. Read it in a read aloud fashion to my students and asked open ended questions while doing so. The students loved it, and so did I. It was a great opener to our investigation of money, what it is, and how we use it. Enjoy!"
2,Temporary Band,"We ordered this along with the ""Womens 4 MM Wide Rhodium Plated .925 Sterling Silver Band Cubic Zirconia Ring"" as temporary commitment bands. I have to say that her's is holding up a lot better. With a band this wide, scuffs and scratches stick out. It will due for now until we buy the ""real"" ones. I wouldn't buy this for actual weddings though. You get what you pay for."
1,Don't buy it.,"I loved the style and the fit of ring when I got it, but within 2 or 3 days, it was already tarnishing."
3,45 years old now,"This is review of 2nd edition.Where there isn't a temporal element it's still accurate, so the length of the state if still 450 miles from Pike to Fulton Counties. Fulton County has the lowest point at 237 feet, ranging up to Black Mountain at 4150 feet. Kentucky was once called Fincastle County of Virginia. Acreage rain is 45.5 "", and average temperature is 76 in July and 36 in January with 180-190 days of growing season.What are most interesting are changes, such as the attitude about coal, and the sense of surprise that ""Negroes"" could go University of Kentucky. Lake Barkley must have just been being built as the book was being built. In 1960 the population was 3 million and now over 4. The density was 76 people per square mile and now, 100. Now the state is 52% urban, and number of farms went from 17 million to 14 million, but acreage increased form 112 acres to 160 acres."
3,a mediocre effort from a talented individual,"Albert Kuvezin has followed a strange trajectory. From the electronic ""Tundra Ghosts"", to a more organic ""Yenisej Punk"" to, now, ""Dalai Beldiri"". Someone must have told him that Tuvan music is big with the Western yuppies and, as a result, his most ""accessible"" and weakest (and most heavily marketed) undertaking to date.While this record boasts a second throat songer, who is a true Golden Boy, the music tends to come across as a Tuvan garage band. In a nutshell, this is a nice alternative to the more mainstream Tuvan folk releases. Yat-Kha however has done much better. If you can get your hands on ""Yenisej Punk"" or ""Tundra's Ghosts"" you'd be much happier, IMHO."
3,Interesting fusion disc.,"Yat-Kha is needless to say, unlike anything you've ever heard. A bizarre combo of blues, 70s era classic rock riffs and the now world renowned Tuvan throat singing. This certainly won't go down as one of rock or world music's classic albums but there are definately some catchy tunes on it. The first two tracks especially are quite good, and would probably make good soundtrack music. There is one track of traditional Tuvan style singing & it seems odd amidst all the experimental fusion stuff, but in actuality makes a nice diversion from the rest of the disc. Of particular interest is the last track, which deals with a bunch of self-exiled Russian Orthodox believers in Tuva trying to escape the opression of the Soviet regime. Its bizarre to hear a sympathetic view of the way these folks were treated sung in Tuvan. This is for the TRULY adventurous."
2,I just want a fair argument,"I just want to read a book that is fair about circumcision. Unfortunately, they don't exist. All books are either extremely for or against. This one is no different."
3,"O.K., But nothing great","I came to Masterplan through Helloween, and I have to say that I was very disappointed. There are very few similarities between the two bands, and Masterplan seems to have very little to say artistically. The only standout tracks are ""Heroes"" & ""Sail On"". Most of the rest of the album serves as background music, but very little is memorable; all is predictable. This is such a huge dissapointment to me because I was hoping that the Weiki/Grapow split in Helloween would lead to releases from 2 great bands. Now all I can hope for is that Helloween's new album shows some creative revitalization after ""The Dark Ride"". Masterplan, I was hoping, would showcase the experimental dark sound that Grapow/Kusch used on that album, but they seem to have backed off (Wussed out?) with thier own effort. They sound more like a Dio knockoff than anything else. I guess I was expecting something more like ""The Dark Ride"". What I got was O.K., but nothing special."
1,Sent a different product!,I was sent a different product than what is shown. I was sent some crappy Dan Electrode power supply which costs $14. Thanks for the free money new haven music.
1,Not worth the money/,Does not stick to the instrument at all. Not worth the money or for any amount if it doesn't stick.
3,accessory item,"A fine accessory item, suitable to its designated function of home entertainment and personal enjoyment. Amazon.com and its excellent staff have done well by me again and the recipient. Uncle Bill got hugs and kisses because it was a thoughtful little extra."
3,Using it for Danelectro Mini Amp,"Bought it for using Danelectro mini amp, so I don't need to worry about the battery. It works perfectly as an adaptor should be, & you won't have any surprise by its performance. :) two stars out because of comparing the price with the mini amp (less than $20), the adaptor is pricy ($8.50), but it still saves me $$ for the long runs."
1,Buzzes like a champ,"I got this because it was specifically recommended for the honeytone miniamp. If this thing does actually kill line noise, I'd hate to hear what it sounds like with one that doesn't. The buzz drowns out the guitar entirely at reasonable volumes. There is no buzz at all with a 9 volt battery in the amp."
5,Small Price - Greate sound,I use this product as a power supply for my Danelectro CoolCat Transparent Overdrive. It is great because it reduce any noise from network...And the most important: it have a small price!
1,Defective Product,"Shortly after we used the charger there was a loud ""Pop"" and the charger was smoking.I checked the primary circuit and there seems to be a short circuit."
5,Necessary item,"If you own any Dan electro pedal,this item is essential to keep it alive.Cant trust batteries."
1,Power adapter for Mini-amp?,I purchased this to use with my mini-amp that runs on a 9 v battery and it doesn't work. What adapter do I need for my Fender Mini Twin?
2,Nice production,"This album should not be confused with another of the same title, of Danish (?) origin, released on Sonet in 1970. That album has somewhat of a cult reputation as a widely unheralded classic in prog circles. This one is American, released in 1973, and at a different level and pitch to the other, European Pan.This Pan is not a ground-shaker, the music is pretty and mellow, in the territory of the Byrds, Seals and Crofts, America or It's A Beautiful Day, that kind of style. There are odd instruments in the mix, harp on the second track (Lady Honey), along with pleasant driving acoustic guitar and strings. Steel guitar is featured quite a lot.One should comment on the superb presentation and production values of this package. Sony Music Japan have taken out all the stops with this one, complete with bilingual booklet with lyrics for all tracks, and b&w; photos of the band."
1,Horrible Headset! Here's why!,"I recently purchased this headset believing the other customer comments on it. Also, I have never been unhappy with Panasonic. However, now I don't think some of them have ever used other headsets before, because this headset flat out BITES! You can't hear very well on it and my friend that I talk to every day complains that it sounds like I'm on a speakerphone. My old headset that I bought for [less] sounds much better on both ends. I think the noise canceling on this thing actually cancels too much! Trust me, it's not as good as most Panasonic products!"
2,"speaker okay, microphone very weak","People routinely complain that I can't be heard when using this headset. The sound on the other end is fuzzy but primarily very faint. Also, the ear clip method doesn't work very well. You end up holding the device to your ear to hear well, so it doesn't fall off, and so the mic is close to your mouth. Certainly not up to Panasonic's usual quality."
4,,"This is without a doubt their freshest release since their reunion album. The unmistakable Destruction trademark sound is all over the place, injecting the songs with a hard-to-resist groove while keeping the momentum heavy and raw. Tracks like ""The Chosen Ones"" and ""Soul Collector"" are instant headbanging classics, while the song ""The Alliance of Hellhoundz"" features guest vocalists from Hypocrisy, Dimmu Borgir, Death Angel and others. The tempo throughout the album is never lost. Moments of quietude last for merely a few seconds before they explode into razor-sharp anthems. There isn't much else to say here, the material at hand is straightforward but with a lot of passion and love towards Metal. This might sound clichéd but...prepared to be destroyed once again by Destruction!"
3,Botony Bay,While the book is outstanding the condition of it when received was poor. It was in pieces. Thankfully allof the pages were there.Bill Jowett
3,"Works well, no auto shutoff timer","Don't be fooled like I was. I assumed ""6 hour timer"" meant it would turn off after being on for 6 hours. No, it means you can set it to be off overnight, and have it automatically turn on before you wake up. That's useless for me. I use it in my office, and it's not safe to leave it on overnight. I'd like it to automatically turn off after, say, 10 hours, so it shuts itself off when I go home for the day and forget to unplug it. Oh, well, aside from that, it does work pretty well."
4,what i thought,"it was very accurate on different scales, and had wonderful information also. If you are interesed in learning more about ESP, clairvoiancy, or telepathy, you should read this book"
4,Developing Your ESP Power,Fell's ESP PowerIt seemed to me to be a condensation of materials I have read in other Jane Robert's books.
4,"Oddly Sequenced, but has some Incredible Pieces by Yared","Yared has come to popularity of late via The English Patient and The Talented Mr Ripley. This score dates back to '88 as the fuel for Beniex's disturbing film about an enchanting woman with a severe mood disorder named Betty who captures the love of a writer named Zorg. The extreme moods herein evoke her see-saw emotions, and admittedly, a few of the briefer pieces would have been better deleted. There's enough here to warrant a purchase, however. Yared is known for his erotic and evocative melodies, and his interesting and non-cloying use of electronics. A sexy interplay of sax, piano and synth abounds herein, but it's the five minute piano solo that stands out. Yared fans might also hunt down his earlier ""Invitation Au Voyage"" score, and ""Map of the Human Heart"", which continue the same style."
2,For fans of the film,"If I didn't have a sentimental attachment to the movie, and associate the music with it in my mind, I would never listen to this: it's just really not that great as music. But if you loved the movie and are a sentimental sap like me, then by all means buy it!"
4,garfield,this book is awesome it lets me draw garfield odie nermal and jonand it gives me tips and how comic strips are made
4,"Gentler, Nastier","Arab Strap's unique appeal has always lain in the juxtaposition of Malcolm Middleton's elegant instrumentation with Aidan Moffat's sinisterly laddish carnal obsessions. Occasionally their songs have an upbeat and rogueish soul quality, vocals drawled in a heavy Scottish brogue over a curious Glaswegian Motown beat, but it is the slower and more spacious songs on which Arab Strap truly shine. 'The Long Sea' is easily this album's finest, showcasing chiming guitars and meandering keyboards with a Middle Eastern quality that are later overwhelmed by a wall of rich and sumptuous feedback."
3,Cheaply constructed,"One of their more acclaimed releases, though I find it weaker than many of the mopey minimalist's albums. AS excel, on occasion, when these dire constructs align properly, and rarely does it come together completely compelling here. Rather, the disc feels a little underdeveloped and underwhelming, if maintaining a serviceable consistency."
4,A touching love story,"I havent been watching a lot of movies lately. I happened to watch this movie on TV. I'd say this is a great family film. Everything is just perfect in the film. The cast especially Sophie.... was brilliant. Pierce Brosnan, Aidan Quinn was good too. The movie had a lot of christian values though and it did have some funny moments. The court scene where Evelyn says a prayer for God to bless Ireland was touching even where Pierce Brosnan tells the court of what he did to get back his children is amazing. The movie is great showing how the love of a father changing the judicial system of an entire country. Pierce Brosnan is in his finest (Sans 007) Evelyn is wonderful movie and should be watch by every child Christian or not."
4,Formulaic but inspiring,"Formulaic tear-jerker based on a true story in which an unemployed, heavy drinking Irish father attempts to win back his children from the clutches of the Church-dominated child protection systen after their mother walks out on the family. Actually found this quite a pleasure to watch, although there were a few hoaky elements that were a little annoying. In this day and age when we're daily bombarded with the feminist-inspired notion that fathers are by and large deadbeat scum, its good to such a positive story about a man whose love for his children supercedes all else."
1,"false teachings about God, swearing and abuse = not a PG movie","Ugh..this movie was awful. I realize it was based on a true story, and I have no doubt that the government and the Catholic church acted exactly as portrayed (to include nuns beating children, teaching the Bible to THEIR standards and not God's: to include the sensationalizing of corruption, gambling, violence, swearing and drunkenness), but to show it all in a rated PG movie?? My mom was in a Catholic orphanage in the 60's and I have heard many awful things...I get the fact that the producers wanted to make this as true to facts as possible, I just feel this should have been a rated R movie."
1,Picture and voice quality undeciperable,"2/4/04 I purchased VHS ""Evelyn"" from Amazon.co.uk since I was purchasing another video not in amazon.com's inventory to make the best of international shipping charges..The VHS has a great illustrating jacket summary of the video plot and I'm certain that I'll shall be able to raise the rating once the VHS is converted to USA VCR systems standards."
4,Evenlyn,Not only is the movie good but the seller was awesome. The delivery was fast and all was great.I would buy again from this seller. Thank you.
5,Makes a great gift!,My mother and father bought this movie and have shown it to everyone they know. they love this movie and i have to admit it is a very good movie. My parents copy of this movie has worn out and they need a new copy so I bought this to replace the copy that they have worn out be watching so many times.
4,An important story about a father's love,"Based on a true story, Evelyn recounts the case of Ireland's first single father to successfully sue for custody of his children. Pierce Brosnan plays the part of the father, Desmond, whose children are removed from his custody and placed in orphanages following the desertion of his wife.Starring Pierce Brosnan, Juliana Marguiles and Aidan Quinn, this heartwarming story follows the transformation of a father who fights to reunite his family and manages to help change Irish perception and policy in the process.Faith, music, and Irish charm are other pleasing facets in this gem of a movie."
5,A Good Fatherly Movie,"Hat's off to Pierce Brosnan on his performance in this film! I'm proud to own this great film on dvd. With all the fatherless children in the world, I was glad to see a movie like this one come along. This film just proves that there are some real men left in this old world. If you only ever own one Pierce Brosnan film on dvd, I highly recommend this one!"
4,Classic,"I've loved this album for years and followed it from vinyl to cassette to CD. I agree with others that the releases before and after lacked each to rough editing and over-pop respectively. ""A Pleasure"" is one of my all-time favorite moody songs."
5,On Baking,"Ordered On Baking for my Bakeshop Principle's Class, it came in a very short time and was in excellent shape. I have ordered books before for school and they were advertised as new but had issues. None with this order!"
1,Wrong damn edition,Amazon sold me the 1st edition instead of the 2nd. My fault for not checking. But I am more than a little upset with Amazon. Had to get 2nd edition elsewhere.
2,"oops, should not have made this album","I have been a Concrete Blonde fan since the very first album and have really enjoyed all of their albums. But after listening to ""Group Therapy"", I thought I might actually need therapy. The first few songs are o.k. at best, but after that it is bad. bad. bad. This album lacks the emotion and the strentgth the band once had. The lyrics are so blah! After hearing the lyrics on ""inside / outside"" over and over again I knew I could go no further with the album. I do still look forward to another try with another album or solo album though."
3,Concrete Blonde - 'Group Therapy' (Manifesto),"I'd rate it 3 1/2 stars.Never being THAT huge of a Concrete Blonde fan,I remember seeing them perform live awhile back and have always been drawn to their first widely known tune,""Still In Hollywood"".Forgotten about them until here recently,with the release of this comeback CD,which I'm sure their long-time fans would probably get more out of it than I did.All three original members are back in the ranks.Johnette Napolitano-bass&vocals,Jim Mankey-guitar and Harry Rushakoff-drums.Can't help but notice that Mankey's guitar playing JUST may be the best thing this disc has going for it.Tracks that I liked best were the glossy pop opener ""Roxy"",""Tonight"",the rocking ""Take Me Home""(sounds as good as their early material),""Valentine"" and ""Inside/Outside"".Just good straight ahead Los Angeles-based post punk is what I would call it.Might appeal to fans of Psychedelic Furs,The Call,Garbage and The Sparks."

1,great film crap copy,This dvd blows chunks.I waited patiently for it's arrival and was let down to the floor.Recorded off the t.v. and it was poorly done ...t.v. logo popping up in the middle of the movie.. rip off ..cant believe amazon allows boot legged crap on their site.Turner has the original and wont release it..which makes them a bunch off dicks...If Turner remastered it and cleaned it up it would be great..I would buy the new copy...
2,Miss Tatlock's Millions,"This was a movie from my childhood which at the time we thought was hilarious. It still is, in parts, and has a great cast with good direction. However, the latter part of the movie tends to drag. My biggest disappointment though was that the quality of the sound is poor, which takes away much of the enjoyment of the film."
1,Miss Tatlock's Millions,"The film itself is a terific little comedy, but this Video Yesteryear DVD in plain packaging is a total rip-off. It is completely unwatchable and a total waste of money. It went right to my shredder. Wait for an eventual release from a legitimate source."
1,A Very Poor copy of a great movie,"This is a great movie with a wonderful cast.It is such a shame that the DVD quality is so bad.As soon as I put it into the player,the picture and sound were horrid.It was impossible to watch.It was copied form the TV and the channel appears on the corner of the frame shortly into the movie.It blacks out in several spots as well.Pass on this one."
1,Movie Is Five Star - Quality of Product Is One Star,"Before purchasing this video, I read a negative review posted by another purchaser. The review referred to the quality of the tape; not the content. I contacted the seller before purchasing and was told (practically verbatum) the reply that is listed in the sellers response to the original review. I was guaranteeed a refund if I was not happy. I bought the tape and the quality is TERRIBLE!! I DO LIVE IN AMERICA and that doesn't help. Twice the screen completely blacked out, multiple times the channel it was taped from flashed across the screen, and there is much ""snow"" in the picture. While I intend to keep the product, it is ONLY because it's easier than trying to catch this movie on the late, late show. FOR THE QUALITY, THE PRICE IS RIDICULOUS!!"
1,"Below Our Standards, He Is Not Kidding",This film looks as if it was taped directly form a television broadcast. I am surprised Amazon is selling this very poor copy. I couldn't watch it.Richard
1,Do Not Buy This,"I agree with the first reviewer. This looks homemade and is basically unwatchable. I also can't believe Amazon is selling this. I actually would give it zero stars. Too bad, because it is a very good movie. The transfer is worse than when I transferred my Betamax tapes to VHS."
2,Deftones gone lazy,"Let me start by saying I love the deftones..However this record just lacks the emotion of the first 3 records. It sounds ""unfinished"" more like rough white pony b sides then a new record..Did Chino record his vocals laying down????"
1,This album shows a band running out of ideas,"I don't understand why these ratings are so high. I love the deftones and all of their albums except this one. This is terrible. Its and off time cluttered mess. The band that had those great groving straight beats, now change that in for off tempo crap when it is not needed. Just look at Hexagram. Terrible!!! If Chino puts anymore effects on his voice he's going to turn into a freakin robot. Buy any other Deftones album but this one!!!!!"
2,Lots of noise...signifying what?,"Seems this album is is chock full of layered tracks, but it all melds together in a disappointing drone. I hard a hard time finding a track I could sink my teeth into. Melodic is lost, hard-driving, indistinguishable drone is apparently in. Wish I'd saved the money, and bought a value meal, instead. Anyone need a used copy of this mess?"
1,What Happened to the Deftones?!!!!,"The music industry seems to be headed towards a more ""pop"" oriented persuasion, since the mainstream success of such bands as say, ""Fred and Jonathan"", and the Deftones are no exception.When the hardcore music scene first came into my life, it was the Deftones ""Adrenaline"" Korn's self-titled EP, and L.B.'s ""3 Dollar blah blah..."".What happened guys?!!! Great cover art on your self titled album, but even all your extras aren't exactly worth [$$$] BR> This is unnerving. ""7 Words""(Adrenaline) is still one of my favorite songs and The 'Tones can't even touch that kind of energy anymore. Kevin Smith's ""Jay's"" description now would run somewhere along the lines of ""whiny little [...] Even better- A new Barbershop Quartet with Fred Durst, Jonathan Davis and Chino himself. The rest of the band can go do some Guess Jeans ads.Put it back on the rack. They're not coming back. Pop is here to stay.........."
2,Slipknot wannbes,"very heavy and loud. There is nothing on the whole cd that resembles a melody, or chorus or anything else that I assosiate with music."
1,I wish i was deaf after listening to these tones.,"This cd is dumb and depressing and if there were balls just hanging there, just floating aloft upon the cd this cd would place the balls in its metaphorical mouth and suck them. This cd seriously is horrible and if i could give it no stars i would but amazon.com isnt cool enogh to do that so i give them 1 star which still sucks because the deftones suck. Frickin wiggles are cooler than this sh**."
2,The same usual deftones,"So here we are, album number four...listening to it though seems so odd. I have the tendency of listening a band's previews cd's when i get a new release and usually i try to see if, according to my taste, they progressed towards a right direction or not. Unfortunately i think the Deftones never really progressed, even in White Pony if you remove Delgado's textures and Morenos occasional guitar playing you still got a cd that sound like Adrenaline and Around The Fur. Not to say that any of those cds including this new one are bad, but honestly i'd like to see a solid change in they're formula since they are a great band and i'm sure they could pull it off."
5,Great Cd I want to give it 4 1/2 Stars,"I want to give this cd 4 and a 1/2 stars. But since i cant ill give it 5. The beginning starts of very disturbing and meaningless. I mean I cannot stand Hexagram. What the hell is that song about??? Its just Chino yelling like a nut. By far the worst song on the album. Also this song will hurt your ears, not in a good way, the music does not go together. But thats just that ONE song.Now we get to the worthy part. Apart for Hexagram the whole song list is absoutly amazing. Evreysong is a keeper. The last six songs on the album are killer! Album ends great (last six). Its ashame that this cd has great song except one. Common Chino what were you doing when you wrote that!! This is a good cd with lots of extras like pictures and stuff. I recomend this cd along with evrey other deftones release. It a top notch cd with the exception for the first song Hexagram. This is a great cd!!"
4,watching flowers bloom,"I have waited in perpetuum for this album, so naturally my expectations were high. The last album 'white pony', was such an inventive and beautiful album, they may never surpass the genius of that recording. The band has always had a murky feeling and songs such as, 'anniversary of an..' show a sadder side of the deftones. The album, at times, doesn't seem as enlightened as their last. Even still, songs like 'needles and pins', 'good morning beautiful', and 'deathblow' show off the elegance of this band. Any Deftones cd is well worth the money. The best thing about this album (and all of their music) is their songs continue to evoke new feelings and emotions each time you listen to them, which is what makes them such an astounding group."
3,"Just not an ""Around the Fur"" or ""White Pony""","I just started liking deftones, so when I heard the new album was coming out, I had to have it. I feel let down by it though. It doesn't compare to the other albums the Deftones have released and I just can't find the great sound I loved so much from White Pony. Don't get me wrong though, I like the album, but its just not a good step up for the Deftones, more of a sidestep, or even a small pace down. Hexagram is my absolute favorite song on it, but it doesn't have the replay-ablility as ""Back to School"", or ""Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)"". You should listen to the songs (perhaps on MP3) before investing in this CD. If you like it, then buy it, but don't spend your hard earned cash on something you might regret"
3,This is what i've been waiting for?,"I wouldn't call this cd a dissapointment for me, i mean it is interesting to listen to, but it is missing some elements the deftones usaully have to make a solid record. Their first single 'Minerva' is at least half decent but in my opinion not single worthy, unlike the last 3 albums this record lacks a lot, i find it is a weaker version of White Pony. Though i cant be too cruel this album will probably grow on me and i'll learn to love it, and it does have its good moments, songs like 'When girls telephone boys' is a stand out and 'Lucky you' has potenial for the next single, and the cd starts great with 'Hexagram' wich i really enjoy until Chino yelps that aweful chorus....Overall i give it a 3, i've waited some years for this cd and i wish it were better, and longer."
1,"Come On Guys, Take A Hint!!!!!","Wow, I picked up a copy of this cd being a fan mainly of their first 2 cd's and a little bit of the third cd. I thought it was going to be a return to Around The Fur, atleast thats what Chino(Vocals), and Stephen(Guitar) said it was going to be. They said quote ""Our new material is so heavy"". I read this in Hit Parader. So I bought the cd and I got crap none of the songs on here are even good, the whole album just blows. A suggestion to the band: Please go back to your old style, Chino sounds good when he screams, and the music is more brutal. Do everyone a favor and make another Around The Fur or Adrenaline style album. The fans deserve another brutal album like Around The Fur. Also please practice more before you go on tour, because you guys sound sloppy live when I saw you with Godsmack."
4,...,"THE DEFTONES HAVE ONCE AGAIN PROVEN THAT THEY ARE ONE OF THE PREMIER ROCK GROUPS OF TODAY, THIS ALBUM IS A SONIC JOURNEY THROUGH ANOTHER LANDSCAPE OF THEIR GROWTH IN THE MUSIC SCENE. NEEDLES AND PINS SHOWS THE HEAVINESS OF THE BAND AND THEN DELVES INTO THE DEEP MELODIES THEY EXPERIENCE IN THE CHORUS. ALTHOUGH THIS ALBUM MAY NOT BE THE CLASSIC THAT WHITE PONY WAS, IT STILL DISPLAYS THE DEPTH OF THEIR SOUND. THEY CONTINUE TO RELEASE TERRIFIC ALBUMS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO EVERY RELEASE FROM THEM."
2,Sound like every other pop nu metal band,"I guess a person who would enjoy this album would either have to be an obsessed deftones fan, tone deaf (no pun intedended), or at an age range of about 12-16 yrs old with no clue of what good metal sounds like. Take a listen to old metallica, Black Sabbath, or I'll go out on a limb and say Godsmack to see what ballsy metal should be.Much like all nu metal these days, these songs have the typical mellow sad vocals that are accompanied by a thrashing sound which sounds more like processed studio mixes resembling what is heard at a NYC subway station. Of course I forgot to mention the offkey screaming and chanting also typical of Nu metal. This just shows how far in decline Rock/ metal is these days when sub standard music (if you can call it that) like this can get released."
1,the deftones new album!,"this album is, to me the bigest disapoint ment ever the deftones are my favorate band and this albumis to be fair absoulutly pants.when i bought this album i was very excited and wanted to get straight home, i realised when i got home that it was not worth the 10 english pounds i payed.i think i will try to pertend that this album never existed.i took it back the next day and got a refund, this is the only deftones album i dont like. and the only reason i gave it one star is because i like the art work."
1,0 stars,dont buy this cd . ! buy adrenaline and around the fur!! its not anyone would expect. maybe its ok if your sleeping
2,Deftones rocks.... with one exception,"I dont know what happened here, but they defintely screwed it up. The only listenable songs are Minerva and Needles and Pins, and those are listenable at best. If your new to Deftones, White Pony and Around the Fur are where to go. Leave this one on the shelf."
2,Laughable...,"My natural inclination was was to give this a one star, but a one star rating is pretty strong. It's not like I hate this album, it just sucks.I'm not jumping the gun either. I've listened to this thing like 5 or 6 times in a row and I actually wanted it to be good. The first song literally sounds like a crying baby. Each line seems to end with a ""WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!"" just like an infant. I wanted to reach into my stereo and give him a pacifier.The first and third tracks are the only one's that even grow on you after a bunch of listens. I don't know how many hundreds of listens it would take for the rest of the songs to.Get one of the first two!"
3,One of my favorites bands!,The cd starts off with a band.... and the first couple of tracks lead you into the thought this isn't going to be like the first ablums..... The cd has 3 or 4 good songs... The rest you can skip...... Don't buy this cd unless your tired of the old Deftone cds...... Peace out!
2,Hugely disappointed,"My brother recently bought this cd. I've listened to all the tracks, and many of them are, well, unlistenable. This cd is a lot less muscial than white pony, with Chino screaming most of the time. There are some great tracks on this cd, like Minerva and the final track. However, it just doesn't stand up to White Pony, and I definitly think the Deftones are more musical than this."
2,Not their best,"As a fan of, well i guess i'll call it the ""softer"" side of the deftones, (songs like change, passenger, digital bath),this album was largely just harsh noise to me, and a bit disappointing. i wanted to like it, really i did. with minerva as the 1st release i guess i was just hoping the rest of the cd would be similar, but not so. i liked about 3 songs, and the rest was just,well, noise."
2,Their Absolute worst....sorry?,"This is by far the worst Deftones album. I gave it several chances, 've listened to it about 5 times all the way through, expecting it to grow on me. Butsadly enough it hasn't. It lacks the rawness of adrenaline, it lacks the power of around the fur, and it lacks the quality of white pony. Imagine everything you love about each deftones album thrown into a blender. but then, tone everything down. thats what this cd is like. Chino delivers once again, with stellar vocal performances. but not een he can save the sub par music. Deathblow and Lucky You are both incredible songs but als fail at saving the cd. 3 stars maybe, if im in the mood."
2,not very good,"I was extremely disapointed by this album. Aside from the three somewhat good songs on this CD it .... it is just constant noise, there is no depth to it. Chino needs to stop screaming once in a while and sing.If you are a new deftones fan go buy the other 3 albums they will make you much more happy."
5,what is wrong with the haters,"I saw the deftones in Pheonix on Nov.1 and it was awesome. Any ways I really want to say that I can't believe the hate that comes through in some of these comments. This is a great album. Really really solid and epic album.This reminds me of when Weezer put out others albums after the blue album and alot of people started hating on them.anyways, this is a great album."
3,White Pony Pt. 2?????,"... Not quite. White Pony is epic, powerful, beautiful, sonic, soft, metallic, and it has Maynard James Keenan dropping in for only the best song on the album. This album is decent. I expected much better."
2,"mediocre and disappointing, even for fans","It's still the Deftones, but this is easily their worst CD. There are a few winners (""Deathblow"", ""Needles and Pins"", etc.), but most of the tracks feel like B-sides, or early demos. Basically every track should be more polished. And some should have just been scraped (i.e. ""Lucky You""). The Deftones latest release feels more like a local garage band's latest, rather than the fourth CD from the same band that made Adrenaline and White Pony."
2,Very disappointed.,"From ""Around the fur"" to ""White Pony"" was a major leap. ""White Pony"" is a masterpiece. From the first listen this album has timeless written all over it. Went and saw them live during that tour and it rawked. I have eagerly awaited this new album for so long, keeping up with all the news, etc.Then it finally came out and it is [bad]. If you say you like it, you are just jumping on the band wagon. Everything that made this band great is gone form this,,. They took out what made all their previous albums great and you are left with this mass of confusion. It doesn't sound like an album, the way the rest of their stuff does. It seems like a collection of songs, thrown together. That techno [stuff]...doesn't fit. A lot of it doesn't. The single [is bad].There are a couple of good songs on here, but as a whole, don't buy it...or of you do, buy it used, this album just came out and there are already 300 used on here...does that tell you something?"
5,FINALLY ITS HERE!,First off I gotta say it DEFTONES have just blown everyone away.Anyways this CD is awsome a lil different in style but all 4 have been do you want to hear the same CD everytime you pick one up for your hard earned cash? me either I have been a deftones fan since the beginning I never even heard em on the radio just picked up adrenaline ta hear sumthin new and have been blown away ever since(adrenaline is still my favorite though) but I agree with what alot of people are sayin you HAVE to listen to it at lest 3 times before it really sinks in to where you love the entire album. and if yer not a deftones fan because there old stuff was maybe to hard you may still dig this one or white pony these guys just keep getting better there talent and variety are growing stronger with every album. I would give it 10 stars if i could this and every other deftones album ever made. So buy the cd go see em live cuz they are the greatest live band out there.
1,The worst thing ive ever heard in my life.,"This is nothing like the deftones used to be. It just sounds like someone dying throughout the whole cd. Theres no melody. No catchy tunes. No good guitar riffs. You cant even hear what the hell is going on, it just sounds like a bunch of distortion with no melody. The drums suck. Everything sucks on this. Dont waste your money on this junk and buy there last cds like adrenaline or around the fur. That was actually music. This CD just sounds like a depressed singer with no more talent for music. Maybe chino will get back to normal one day. I give this cd -349 stars."
2,ok but not great,"adrenaline was an awesome disc. There were a few points in it that were a little wierd, but all in all its a great CD. Around the Fur, I think, is their best and most defining CD. Full of great songs ie. be quite and drive, my all time favorite deftones song. White Pony was definitely a good job in terms of the experimentation involved. Not better than its predecessor, but still very good. This disc just didn't really grab me like around the fur, or even white pony for that matter. Deftones really didn't expand their horizons much. Bloody Cape seems very around the fur-esque, Minerva is a good song, also reminiscent of classic tones. I'd still buy this CD despite the lack of effort by the band."
1,Deftones are done,"Wow. I was pretty excited to get the new deftones album. I had been reading in articles that it was going to be a heavier album than the White Pony. The White Pony was not a terrible album. It had it;s good songs (Korea, Pink Maggit, even Change), butit was obviously slower and more melodic than the previous two albums. The new album however is sooooo boring. I don't mind slow deftones songs. I love Drive from ""around the fur"". However, these slow songs are lame. Chino sounds like he got hit in the head too many times. They all seem to sound the same. Very boring! Even the token hard sond is boring. They need more ups and downs. This hurts because I loved the Deftones. If you were a deftones fan from the beginning it is hard to want to stay one. It is over."
3,"""around the fur"" is their best album","deftones albums, best to worst:1) around the fur2) adrenaline3) white pony4) deftones"
1,Can Chino Even Sing?,"I bought this album and was met with screaming for about 70% of it. Deftones have released some good stuff, White Pony and Around The Fur are great, but I eventually gave this CD away for a soda.Try old Deftones, at least back then they were trying."
4,Great Record,"This is a good record. I don't think it's as good as White Pony, but it's still great. ""Minerva"" is probably my favorite Deftones song. cant go wrong."
5,BEAUTIFUL!!!,"I will always give every Deftones album 5 stars. They make the most beautiful music known to man. I can't imagine my life without this band. They are not nu-metal, even though so many people lump them in with Limp Bizkit and Korn. Their music completely transcends that scene. This album did not disappoint at all. Some of the songs on Deftones are the most haunting and depressing work they've ever done, while some are the hardest they've ever done. If you've never heard Deftones before, I suggest starting now, you will not regret it!!! Also check out Around the Fur, my personal favorite!!!"
4,4 stars all the way but not 5,"Deftones is a band that I have been listening to since the mid 90's and actually introduced them to the circle of people I evolve in. There 4th titled album is a compulation of written work that gives the feel of many of there latest albums. The first song of the album (hexagram) starts the ""feel"" and puts the melody in your head for hours. Each aditional song images the growth of the band from mid 90's to present. Electronics have been introduced more in this album like (lucky You) which personally throws the whole album off its course. I need a feel and electronica music is not DEFTONES to me. But, I will give it a couple of weeks and a few more listenings. All in all the album is great and might surpass the likings of thier last album. Just wish they stayed away from the ""techno"" feel."
4,deftones continue to break out of the rap/rock genre,"As the deftones continue to evolve (unlike most of the bands lumped into their genre) this is their next step in the evolution process. My initial response was weak, but I reminded myself that deftones are primarily a ""live"" band and this helped me sink deeper into Chino's great vocal and lyric writing abilities.I could have expected another quick, thrown together, attempt to make more $$, but this is far from true. This is an artistic achievement that reminds me of a combination of ""around the fur""and White Pony. I am glad to see a band like the deftones have learned what not to do (just look at how Korn is falling to pieces). Give this album some time and attention and it will take hold of you."
2,pop music as a disposable artform,"First track is great, but slowly it dawns on you that the 'tones are running out of ideas...or perhaps the longtable discussions in Maverick's conference room massaged this long-awaited tome into banality. Production is monolithic and nicely crushing, but Chino's vox tend to hover and drift with occasional hooks...but mostly they just hover and drift. I liked White Pony better, and 'round the Fur sounded a little more fierce than this one. Maybe they're getting old, maybe I'm getting old...whatever the case, Shai Hulud's new album also came out on the same day and I have to give that one the May release trophy.I'm hoping this new Deftones will grow on me, but as it stands...I'm more moved to watch the acoustic stuff from the Deftones live in Hawaii DVD."
4,deftones fan,"I thought that the cd was good but I don't listen to the whole cd. My favorite song off that cd is needles and pins because it remindes me of their old school stuff. The last 2 cd's that they put out(white pony and deftones) were so so, but I still enjoy listening to their music. Even though I know it will be a while, I can't wait to see how their next cd turns out."
4,Thank You Deftones,"Here's how I rate:5: Masterpiece.4: Must have for a collection.3: Worth the buy.2: Its listenable.1: Complete waste of time and money.All I need to say is if you like harder music, get this album. At first, I didn't like it and thought they had put ""filler"" on the album. I also thought the songs sounded too similar (excluding the filler). After a few months though, the filler is even good (though not as good as the rest).I'm glad there is no rapping.If you haven't picked this up, or if you have and you find it not to be up to your standards, give it a chance. For some, its one of those albums that needs to grow a little."
4,Dark and emotional,"I have never been a big fan of the Deftones and had heard little of their music prior to spending time with this album. During the first listen, you do actually feel a little bored - it seems to lack the power you would expect and almost feels too common. Like many great albums though, this one requires a few listens to really understand. Once the hook digs in (and it will), this will be one of the most addictive albums you will listen to - one that I am sure you will still have close to your player 6 months down the track. The melodies become familiar but more intricate, and the passion really hits you hard. This emotion is what truly sets this band apart from its peers. There are a couple of tracks that let the album down where it loses its intensity. However, despite these flaws, if you put the effort in it will be one of the more rewarding listens you will have this year."
5,Sex and rock'n roll,"Deftones is a great musical mixture of brutality, sex, somnambulism, and guarded intelligence. This is very sexy rock and roll over and over and over..."
4,Deftones kick ass!,Although the CD is amazing it is not one of Deftones best. Around The Fur is by far their greatest album. Hexagram is an addictive song though! The CD is worth buying!
5,Lordy,"I bought this album yesterday, the day it came out, and Im glad I did because this album is rediculously good. EVERYONE needs to buy this album now. The whole thing is fantastic. Its a little different from their past albums but at the same time its alot alike. Youll see. So go buy it!"
4,good but not as good as i was hoping...,just picked up the disc on my lunch break...not quite as heavy as i would have liked. i definitely need to listen to it a few more times to get a feel for the music. overall a good listen - and one that most deftones fan will enjoy -- but if you're looking for a return to adrenaline or around the fur -- forget it. the boys have grown up and diversified their sound a bit. if you really dug white pony you'll definitely be into this one!
2,Sounds like every other pop nu metal band,"I guess a person who would enjoy this album would either have to be an obsessed deftones fan, tone deaf (no pun intedended), or at an age range of about 12-16 yrs old with no clue of what good metal sounds like. Take a listen to old metallica, Black Sabbath, or I'll go out on a limb and say Godsmack to see what ballsy metal should be.Much like all nu metal these days, these songs have the typical mellow sad vocals that are accompanied by a thrashing sound which sounds more like noise heard at a NYC subway station. I'll also mention the offkey screaming and chanting also typical of Nu metal. This just shows how far in decline Rock/ metal is these days when sub standard music (if you can call it that) like this can get released."
1,Different doesnt mean good.....,I consider myself a pretty hardcore deftones fan and i have to say that i dont like this album. As much as i try to make myself like it i cant. Yes it is different. But that doesnt mean its good. If you are a fan of Adrenaline and Around the fur. That is not at all what you are getting so save your money. CD is quite boring at times and it flat out just doesnt sound good. This is coming from a nu-metal fan so im not against the genre. Overall this cd is not good and especially for the deftones this is a poor cd. Hope we dont have to wait 3 more years for another letdown like this......
2,Nap Time.,I like all the previous Deftones albums but I must say this one is BORING! Tough to tell one song from the other. I tried to let this thing grow on me but it just won't. By the way this Album has tanked on the Billboard Charts I'm not alone in my opinion. Wake up and rock Deftones or bye bye!
3,3/12 stars,I bought ATF the first week it came out and I've been a huge fan ever since. This is a great album but I have to admit(although I don't like to) this album does get a little boring. It just kinda lacks the energy of ATF and White Pony. Still a keeper though for any Deftones fan. I'd probaly rate this as their 3rd best coming right before adrenaline.
4,Great CD!!!,"Very great work here, Not my favorite but very very good, Personally Needles and Pins in my opinion is a work of rock art.Other great tracks are Bloody Cape, Deathblow, Hexagram.personally ATF is my fav followed by Pony but i feel they are growing as a band and every band changes a little. Great Stuff!!"
2,New sound for the deftones.....,I couldent wait to get my hands on the new Deftones cd when I first heard it was released. I rushed over to the cd store and bought the cd. Once I put it in my disc man I was stunned by what I heard. It was so different then anything I've ever heard by The Deftones. Don't get me wrong there one of my favorite bands but compared to their other stuff this was completly different. Sometimes that can be a good thing but this time it wasint. For the first month listening to the cd I hated it. The new sound wasint doing much for me at the time but after a while this cd started to grow on me and I started to liek it more. I would deffenitly not reccomend this for poeple who havent heard the deftones before because you might get the wrong impression. This is not one of there best cds compared to the rest. I would reccomend around the fur over this.
2,NEW SOUND FOR DEFTONES IS A DISSOPOINTMENT,I couldent wait to get my hands on the new Deftones cd when I first heard it was released. I rushed over to the cd store and bought the cd. Once I put it in my disc man I was stunned by what I heard. It was so different then anything I've ever heard by The Deftones.

I would reccomend around the fur over this.
2,Chino gets annoying...,"I am only a moderate Deftones fan, but was a big supporter of ""White Pony"", but I feel that their latest effort really misses its mark. The music is still strong on this album, although the songs really seem to run together, as they have similar structures and tempos. But the music is good, continuing the Deftones tradition of either eerie or heavy songs. The main problem with this disc is the singing of Chino. Most of his lyrics are inaudible, and his voice simply gets annoying by the end of the album. Several songs passed by, and I could feel their greatness, if only he wasn't whining his way through it. I was hoping this album was going to be alot better than it is, but it is not bad enough to lose faith in this very good, and usually very original, band."
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"The Deftones really did try their best with this album, but there is one thing that sinks it and that is VOCALS. Chino has almost no voice left, and the result is a series of incoherent mumbles and screams. The lyrics are sub-par as well, but they could be mildly interesting if I could actually hear them. The rest of the band is giving 110%, I can really tell. But there are only a few standout songs on the album like Minerva and Battle-Axe, where Chino doesn't scream the whole thing. For example, listening to the first track 'Hexagram', Chino at one point seems to go 'pressure PLAY pressure PLAY pressure PLAY pressure PLAY' when he's actually saying 'worship PLAY'. Does it make sense? I don't know. Is it interesting? Not in the slightest. Perhaps what made White Pony so good was that Maynard from Tool did guest vocals. 'Deftones' is currently collecting dust on the shelf in my room."
4,Deftones Go back to the roots,"It's not that I was dissapointed with White Pony, however It just didn't grab me as around the fur or adrenaline did and take me for a complete ride. Iv'e been listening to Deftones since they released adrenaline, and I have to say that their latest release DOES NOT dissapoint.Everything about this album from the opening track, Hexagram, gets into your ears, mind, and soul. Stef's amazing guitar work does not dissapoint,Chino's Insane yet melodic vocals blend smoothly as usual, and Abes drumming is outstanding, Chi holds it down solid as usual.This album has some very brutal moments, as well as beautifully melodic moments as well. you can see a definite Depeche Mode-Cure influence in the songs ""Lucky You"", with traces of trip hop. ""Deathblow"" and ""battle-Axe"" Rock hard.This album is like a blend of ""Around The Fur"" and ""White Pony"". in a time of watered down rock, and candy punk, this Album crushes and outshines."
5,DEFTONES ARE BACK WITH THEIR BEST ALBUM,"THIS ALBUM IS SPIRITUAL, YOU CAN HEAR IT IN CHINO'S VOICE AND THE TONE OF THE BAND. EACH SONG FITS WITH CHINO DIVING HEADFIRST INTO THE COLD WATER WITH ''LUCKY YOU'' AND ''ANNIVERSARY OF AN UNINTERESTING EVENT'' THE SLOWNESS JUST EXTENDS TO A VERY SPIRITUAL PLACE. THESE ARE POWERFUL, INTELLIGENT LYRICS, THE DEFTONES HAVE BUILT UP A SONIC LANDSCAPE THAT IS LOUD AND FILLED WITH INSIGHT INTO THE VAST WAVES OF BOTH DARK AND LIGHT IMAGERY. THIS ALBUM MUST BE PLAYED FROM START TO FINISH, NO FILLERS HERE."
4,Good cd.,"It could of been better, but very solid for alternative and metal listeners alike. Best songs are minerva, Deathblow, battleaxe, and Anniversary of an Uninteresting Event.Definitly worth buying, great album, but the tones can do better!"
1,deaftones for deaf people only,"listening to these guys makes me more depressed. they are dull, boring, and dont have any catchy melodies. the singer sounds like he just got hit with a led pipe in the scrotum. at least limp bizkit have melodies in their music. nobody likes this music, they just say they do to have a badass image. deftones suck. they are named the deaftones for a reason. only deaf people should listen."
1,what have they done,"What is wrong with the deftones? They have finally lived up to their name and became completely tone deaf. I loved Adrenaline and Around the Fir. I even thought White Pony was a great transition and I hoped they would change in more unexpected ways. But this... What am I saposed to do with this... Most of the songs start off with the same melodic intro then go imediately into a wall of borring sound that even blocks out chinos vocals. And speaking of Chino, I really miss his old scream. Every time I listen to ""elite"" on White pony, I get the shivers and really feel him. But on this album he just wails like a creaking fence. This album was definately a huge dissapointment. Don't bother even downloading it unless you're planning on giving out burned copies so that they loose money"
1,Happy to be a Deftones Fan!,"A solid record for any deftones collection, while not their best, it is still worth listening to if your a true deftones fan. They continue to expand the genre of Nu Metal and continue to seperate themselves from the wannabes with solid guitar work, good beats, and of course Chino's patented yells. A must for any fan of true music. Give it a listen and i'm sure you will be pleased. DEFTONES ROCK!"
2,Does any one else feel like sleeping?!,"Crap. Pure Crap. If you like all of Deftones other CDs, and you thought ""Around the Fur"" was just OK, Then you will want to throw this in the garbage. The only reason i gave this CD 2 stars is because Deftones is one of my favorite rock bands, and i am willing to follow them through thick and thin.-Metal, AHHHHHHHH-"
2,Too Slow,"Don't get me wrong; I love it when Chino gets all sentimental but a whole album? Come on, can I get something I can snowboard too? I don't hate the album it just wasn't what I was expecting after Adrenaline, White Pony and Around the Fur (three fantastic albums by the way). All those albums rocked my socks off but I'd suggest picking Saturday Night Wrist instead of buying this one if you don't have it already."
4,"Brian, that's the funniest low-brow comment I've seen...","But I disagree in that metaphorical testicles do NOT hang from this album. This is good stuff folks, but it takes time to get into...just like it's slightly better predecessor White Pony. Stand-outs are Minerva, Bloody Cape, Good Morning Beautiful...oh what the heck, they're all good. Others have said what I would say, so you know, read someone else's review. Oh, and Linkin Park is a great band, if you don't take them too seriously. Cheerio"
2,Boring mess of sludge,"Sorry but i have to edit my last review. At first i gave this album the benefit of the doubt and rated it 4 stars but after multiple listens it has failed to grow on me, unlike the great White Pony did. The album is just boring and overly noisey. Who mixed this thing? You can barely hear the vocals at all, they're buried under all the sludge. Some songs brake away from the monotony such as the explosive opener ""Hexagram"" which is as melodic as it is brutal. ""Bloody cape"" would be a good track on Around the Fur. And contrary to most fans beleif, ""Anniversary.."" is a wonderful ballad which almost makes up for the horrible failure of ""teenager"" on White Pony. The rest of the album just sends me to sleep, including the My Bloody Valentine sounding ""Minerva"". Overall, Deftones is a dissapointing album. It lacks both the emotion of Around the fur and the growing vision of White Pony."
3,3 Stars because its Deftones,"I am so sad to say that I am not impressed by this Deftones release. Like many, I find this new Deftones to be very lackluster. I wish I knew the cure for the affliction that overcomes musicians when they become wealthy. Gone on this Deftones self titled album is the most important element in their equation, passion. One listen to Around the Fur and the listener is embrased by urgency and anger, on this self titled album its been replaced by moaning and what seems like boredom. I guess a similar analogy would be Staind's Dysfunction to Break the Cycle or Limp Biskit 3 Dollar Bill to Chocolate Starfish or Incubus Science to Morning View, anyways I could go on and on. Such a shame. I was really looking forward to this, the new Radiohead, and the new Anthrax. Fortuneately this new self titled Deftones is the only one that disappoints."
4,Impressive,"I bought this album skeptical of not hearing the other Deftones albums. I can say after owning this album for only 3 days, I can't get enough of it. After listening to it for the first time, it may seem excessive or overly heavy with songs like ""When girls telephone boys"" but they are addicting and even hypnotic. There are only two or three songs I won't listen to including ""Lucky you"" and ""The anniversery..."" which are flat out terrible. Over all this album is an excellent find. Best tracks on the album are Hexagram, Needles and Pins, Minerva, and Bloody Cape."
4,A completely unique listening experience,"I got this album when it first came out and it was much different than what I thought it would be. It is heavier than White Pony, but the songs have the same creepy vibe. I think some fans trash this album because they are waiting for another ATF but that isn't gonna happen, because The deftones continue to evolve their unique sound on this album, and it really starts to grow on you after awhile. If you are looking for a musical experience unlike any other check out this album."
3,Why did I find this to be a disappointment??,"I gave this CD three stars, but if you're familiar with the Deftones and listen to thier music like its nobody's business, then you know that a three-star rating is not good enough. I am a big fan of Deftones, (and deeply infatuated with Chino Moreno) but I was really upset with what I heard. ""Deftones"" was a cross between the sequel to ""White Pony"" and a shot at ::gasp:: mainstream success. Don't get me wrong, I did like some songs on the CD. Songs like ""Pins and Needles"" and ""Good Morning Beautiful"" grew on me. ""Battle-axe"" is my personal favorite song on the album. But, even the strongest tracks were overpowered by the weak ones. I'm trying to figure out who I would recommend this album to, and how I would reccommend it. But I don't even know where to begin. So on that note, I love you Deftones, but I can say as a fan that this was a very disappointing album."
3,where did my hardcore deftones go???,"This CD is the final transition of the deftones and their journey from hard rock with all the screaming and yelling you got from their first cd adreniline, to the soft sounds we start to see in white pony with all the synthisized sounds starting to blend in and make up more and more of the music as they progress. This self titled cd is definetly cool to listen to when sitting around, but nothing to let out any kind of agression you might have."
2,"Dull, Dull and Duller","I felt Pamela Thomas-Graham took too long to develop the plot, there was a limited amount of action and most of the characters were dull and reassure with dull characters you are sure to have a dull book. I was being generous by rating this book at 4. The only reason the book captured a 4 is because the ending was not expected and one or two characters of the book were interesting but Pamela Thomas-Graham needs to go right back to the drawing boards. Better luck next time."
3,"Not bad for a first start, but strays from academia","While the text has the typical first-novel flaws, it's not a bad first-try. However, for all the author's accomplishments, it's clear that she isn't from academia. An assistant professor does not write papers *for* the chair; at best she'd be a co-author. Nor does an assistant professor write editorials for the chair, nor does the chair threaten to take away a class in the middle of the term (unless the professor is grossly negligent, not showing up for class for example). Any Ivy League professor would be happy to have a class taken away so they could concentrate on research, which is what gets them tenure. Nor does success come from performing on committees, nor does the president control tenure decisions. For those of us in the academy, more fact-checking would make the book more enjoyable and believable."
2,Disappointing.,"When I first heard about this book, I was really excited because of its African-American author and characters, but it soon became obvious that the reader has to have been at an ivy-league college to get into this book. Not being an ivy-grad, I found it very hard to relate to much of anything in it. The writing style seems like the front page of the Wall Street Journal. The characters seem either flat or cliche (and by cliche I mean REALLY cliche). Books about successful African-American characters should inspire to be like them, but this one sure doesn't. Don't waste your time with this one."
1,Not a very good book,"This book was horrible -- don't waste your money. If you really have to read it get it from a library. I wish I had. The plot is weak, the writing is stiff and the relationship between the lead characters silly.If you want a good thriller with an African American female, try Riding the Snake by Steven Cannell."
1,Very very bad...,"Simply put, this was one of the worst mystery books I've ever read. How simplistic could she be!! The book read like a list of the best-known cliches and I could barely get through it. Ms. Thomas-Grahan should stick to her day job..."
1,Way to exploite the Ivy League,"This book was poorly written and exploited the Harvard name. No, I don't go to Harvard, but I do go to Yale, and I think it's sad this woman needs resort to writing a super-market shelf novel using her alma mater as the selling point to make money. It's just a school, get over it! If you want to address race relations, or any other social situations at Harvard, don't do it through a mystery novel. I hope readers realize that this book does not fairly represent Harvard or any other Ivy League school."
1,This should be so much better...,"Well, why not exploit Harvard (or any other IVY League institution) if you went there? The problem with this book is it sounds like the energy must have gone into the pitch (obviously, the author made a few connections as a consultant to entertainment companies) rather than the content. Hopefully, sales will sustain Ms. Thomas' series long enough for her to grow into the craft. But this book is a clunker--the dialogue, structure, stereotyped characters, and narrative cliches all detract so much from the predictable plot, it was impossible to enjoy the book or ever forget you were reading an author who reminds you twice--on the back of the paperback and inside the cover--that she graduated Phi Beta Kappa etc, etc from Harvard."
2,Lost me !,"When I first happened upon this book by a recommendatiion, becaude I am a lover of mystery/interracial romance novels, so when I read this book I thought I would really enjoy the storyline as well as the romance between Nikki and DanteBig disapointed on both counts. Hard to follow and as far as a romance for the romance of any kind that was mentioned it could have been left out of the book."
3,A touch of class,"Finally, a mystery featuring a black character who is educated, interesting, and does not speak ebonics and thinks about other things than models of cars or what designer clothing. And, her dialogue is fresh, lively, and doesn't constant begin with ""Um.""Reading about this Ivy League was interesting. My only complaints are that I didn't feel Nikki did much sleuthing, and the book was a bit too long. I did like the supporting cast. Also, the relationship with Dante was nicely done."
4,A fast and compelling read.,"I enjoyed this book and finished it in one gulp. The setting is vaguely similiar to the small college I went to, and scenes in the library brought back memories of, in fact, being locked there all night. I think the author had a good mix of dialogue and description. I didn't get some of the slang terms, and maybe she put in a few stereotypical African-Americans to ease it along for those WASP's (me) who like to read a new mystery and learn about other cultures, albeit superficially. But the job atsmosphere that exists in an institution dominated by white males is one experienced by all women. The author did a good job of describing the different methods women use in those situations: get-along, go-along, get righteous or get out. I am recommending this book to other mystery lovers who like a female protagonist with intelligence."
2,For a novice it was OK,"Even though I could relate immensely to Veronica Chase (her and I are nearly identical in thought and action), I still found the book to be pretty sophomoric and insipid for my mystery tastes."
2,I *did* finish it -- otherwise it would be 1 star.,"I agree with several of the 1 star reviews. Full of mystery cliches, lots of padding, pretty poor writing, and a cast of thoroughly one-dimensional characters -- the love interest between Nikki and Dante is so thin as to be comical.If the book were re-cast as comical, and re-written in that style, it might be much better.The main reason I finished was the Harvard/Cambridge connection.Good luck if you buy this one, but check the used bookstore first -- my copy will be there soon!"
1,Yet another tedious tome by yet another wannabe,"This book is little more than a paean to the author's good fortune at having gotten into Harvard. I, too, am an alumnus of that august institution, but I got over it a long time ago. And this, in sum, would be my advice to Ms. Graham before she pens any more of these banal ""Ivy League Mysteries"" : It's wonderful that you were able to get an Ivy League degree or two, but this alone does not validate your existence. Get over it and get on with the more substantive aspects of living."
4,Loved it!,"This is a thoughtful, well-written, intelligent murder mystery. That in and of it itself would be good, but then to add a protagonist to whom I could relate so well personally, gives it an extra star!!!"
3,LIke Zelig,A very good quick read but it Nikki Chase our heroine seems always to be in the right place at the right time. This type of mystery seems somewhat unreal. It is saved by some terrific characters. I especially enjoyed the Rafe the police man who adopts NikkiThe ending was enjoyable.
4,Couldn't put it down!,"I found this book so engrossing, I just had to stay up way past my bedtime to finish it. I learned many new things about Easter Island while reading this book, and I very much enjoyed the dual stories of Elsa and Greer and their lives on Easter Island. I must admit I found the alternating chapters flipping back and forth between Elsa and Greer a bit disruptive. I found myself skipping ahead to read Elsa's story and then went back to read Greer's chapters. Overall, I think this is a haunting tale well worth reading."
3,"""Beautifully written"", yet plodding and dull","Everything I read about this book said it was ""beautifully written"" and, technically, it was. However, the plot was dull and the characters presented, rather than developed. I just could not get into the story and did not finish it."
4,Three parallel connected stories,"The stories of a German Admiral, an English governess and an American botanist are given episodically. The prose is well written and you sometimes almost feel like you are on Easter Island.Easter Island has become a case study in human environmental destruction and the fall of a civilization. The pictographic writing of Easter Island has yet to be decoded and the English lady with here scientist husband and retarded sister in 1914 is making an effort. The American botanist has her own tale of woe, but she manages to prove that the island once was a forest of trees that were cut down by the residents. The German admiralis trying to hide from all the allies in WW I, but finally low on coal and ammunition meets a British fleet near the tip of South America.The book kept me interested and has a lot of very good historical material as well."
3,Good story but.............,"It was a good read. Very well researched and intriguing. The thing I didn'tlike was the abrupt ending. Did'nt know the fate of some of the characters at the end. I think the ending could have been little different, but overall really like the story and the idea. A great mix of fiction and facts."
1,Don't Squander Your Reading Time,"I borrowed this book from the library and I'm glad I didn't buy it in addition to wasting the time I spent reading it. It's rare when I feel I've been had by an author, and this is one of those times. I should have known better; when I see a cover like this one, red flags should pop up to keep looking for something with better content."
2,Not up to expectations,"Easter Island by Jennifer VanderbesThe premise of the novel sounded wonderful, two women 60 years apart exploring Easter Island. Unfortunately, the book couldn't make up it's mind if it should be a novel or a botany textbook on pollen. The characters had potential, but basically you just read about these two women instead of getting to know them. The ending of the book was also disappointing and since the only reason I finished the book was to find out what happened at the end, I didn't like the open ending which left you guessing"
5,I loved it!,"I thought this book was excellent! I would definitely recommend it... I couldn't wait to see what happened but didn't want it to end either! The ""technical"" information is a bit much at times but really not that bad at all, I enjoyed learning about the scientific aspects of Greer and Elsa's adventures. Definitely a different kind of novel, not your typical stuff!"
5,One of the best first novel I've read,"Okay, this is not a ""perfect"" novel. But I won't waste time listing its minor flaws. But I'm giving it five stars because it is one of the best first novels I've ever read, and I think the writer was about twenty-something when she wrote it. (Yikes! And Entertainment Weekly picked her as an ""It"" girl!) It's a multi-layered book: there are alternating time frames, there is information about botany and anthroplogy woven effortlessy into the novel, and there are two very compelling and complex heroines. It reads somewhat like a mystery, yet there's a lot to ponder when it's over: if starting over is possible for a whole island ecosystem, is it also possible for individuals?Some sad, but emotionally honest moments at the end...I will definitely look for the author's next."
3,Excellent--if you don't read the end!,"Wow. I had lots of good word of mouth suggestions on this one, but what a disappointment. History, betrayal, the cover promises...history, yes, betrayal??! Sounds a bit melodramatic considering the lack of weight and time the 'betrayals' were given. I did very much like the spin on such an intriguing island, but something is wrong when the reader cares more about flowers than the actual characters. The ending--ah! I called it a mile away. Was a major disappointment. Was expecting much more. Mixed feelings overall."
4,"Two stories, lots of suspense","Easter Island is one book with two stories. One begins in 1913 with an Englishman biologist and his wife traveling from England to South America. The second begins in 1973 with a woman traveling from New York. Shifting between stories and time, the suspense builds.The book starts out kind of slowly, then suddenly becomes a compelling read and you can't read fast enough to find out what happens next."
2,a.s. byatt wannabe,"anyone who has actually read a.s. byatt or michael cunningham's the hours will see how verrry familiar this plot is. mostly ho-hum with only a dash of sparkle. a hopeful start, but it turns into predictable sitcommery by novel's end. I do like the unique island setting though."
2,weak effort...,"As I was trying to sum up this book one word came to mind...weak. The story is weak, the writing is weak, and the character development is weak. It is a very boring book with little to no redeeming qualities. Another reviewer used the word ""forced"" and I tend to agree with them. It seemed like a forced book by a writer with little experience that didn't quite know how to tie everything together and develop it. I would find this hard to recommend to anyone."
2,Nice idea - but not well executed,"There are some fine ideas in this novel. The parallel plots of an early-1900s expidition, a modern scientist looking for fossilized pollen, and the ill-fated mission of some German war-ships converge nicely at the end, and that is structurally a very effective ploy. But you arguably have to wait a long time for it, and in the meantime there is a lot of rather dull character development. The 'modern' (1970s) part of the novel revolves around a rather average American woman scientist. Why not make her flamboyant, strong, hotblooded, sexy, or at least SOMETHING to make her come alive? She is just not exciting, sorry. The Victorian part of the plot boasts Elsa, who is a much more interesting person, but again predominantly rather dull. The most interesting character is perhaps the mentally disabled sister Alice. At least there is something unusual about her. Should cut the novel down to half length and inject some excitement."
1,A struggle from start to finish,"I have just finished the book for our book club next month and I don't have anything good to say about it. It was far too much information on flora and fauna interspersed with Greek origins (gymnosperms - gymnos sperma - naked seeds). I felt as though I was in a botany class and it was too boring for me.After finally getting through the book -- it took me about a week of perseverance -- I came to the conclusion that the author had a disdain for the male population and it came through with her treatment of Thomas and Beazley. Maybe it was just a feminist leaning, I don't know.The one thing I got out of the book was an interest in Easter Island. I will read true accounts of the history of the island and hopefully get a better understanding of its geography and its stone statues (moai).It certainly wouldn't be a book I would put on my shelf."
1,a bore-filled trip to a fantastical island,"Could not get involved with any of the characters. Ultimately, I just didn't care about whether or not these people get off the island. A little to melodramatic and over-written for my taste."
1,botany and boredom,"This is one of the novels that comes across as first having a terrific idea but ultimately fails short of delivering. The 2 lead women protagonists' stories shift way too abruptly to let the reader care about their so-called passions or their relentless tedious work on the island in the field of botany. i feel this took huge liberties with WWW I seamen's mental and emotional states and if I was in that war, i would be grossly insulted. Points for a one of a kind location for a book, but I hate having to cute through the pretense to SEE the island. Look elsewhere for an adventure with heart."
1,"ho-hum, little sparkle",High expectations due to the buzz but this book was a real let down. the ending is highly implausible and the dialogue was just plain old unbelieveable throughout. The prose was lovely but characters were left half-drawn. A mega disappointment. Go to the real island and see for yourself.
2,Easter Island was disappointing.,Some women in my book club found the story to be good. I was expecting more information on Easter Island itself and was let down. I was not captivated by the two main characters and did not finish the book.
2,Disappointed,"I won't discuss the story line of this book or its principal charactes, many others have already done that. This would be an interesting book for someone who had a real interest in Easter Island and had some grasp of - or at least interest in - the scientific studies being conducted by several of the protagonists. I wasn't particularly interested in either and didn't care for the book. In fact it's fair to say I was very disappointed in the book after having first read the author's second book, ""Strangers at the Feast,"" which I had trouble putting down - just the opposite of ""Easter Island,"" which I had trouble picking up."
3,good but not a compelling,What can I tell you about this book that has not already been written? Not much too much.The story combines the lives of two women from different eras who lives entwine against the backdrop of the remote Easter Island. The story's interesting historical and botanical details were woven into a decent but not compelling narrative - for me at least. The subplots of the minor characters sometimes distracted from the main story-lines and some were left like hanging threads.A decent but not great story.
2,It just fell flat,"This story never drew me in. The characters never made me care about them. Easter Island sounds interesting, but even with a strong interest, the flora and fauna descriptions mired down the pace. It was slow. The book promised more than it delivered."
2,She left out all the good stuff,"Easter Island had potentially interesting parallel plot lines that are presented in an uneven and dull manner and in the end fizzle. The character development deserves a huge yawn and the main ""modern"" character, Greer, is clearly a run-of-the-mill scientist who is capable primarily of whining about her own self-inflicted lack of success. The author fails to develop what might have been the most interesting plot line - the commencement of World War I and the difficulties presented by the geographical isolation of the German Pacific fleet. The author has gathered some interesting facts and woven a couple of potentially interesting timelines into a weak but sometimes enjoyable ensemble, but in the end I am left imagining the author researching this book in a single strenuous weekend of Web searching."
3,A good effort,"I would say that about 4 of the songs are worth listening to in any consistent fashion. Unless their is an artist that you truly love, or you really want to support the cause, I would pass."
1,This book is garbage,"This book is garbage. I thought it would help me win games and teach my players how to run a transition offense. unfortunately we got more out of burning it then actually reading it.sincerely,Jay John"
2,hard to watch,"I haven't watched all of them yet, but of the ones I have watched, the quality of the videos takes away from the enjoyrment of watching them. They have poor sound and visual quality. No wonder they're cheap."
5,A Fast-paced Legal Thriller,"Based on some of author/attorney Nino Lama's actual cases, ""The Binghamton Blues"" is a larger than life legal thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and guessing at the outcome until the final pages.The action moves back and forth between upstate New York and the Florida keys, with the good guys, attorney Vince diMarco and his son Mike, pursuing the bad guys with the same zeal they pursue beautiful women.Lama's characters are rich and fully developed. His precise prose moves the story along at a rapid clip and avoids getting the reader bogged down in legalese.All in all I found ""The Binghamtom Blues"" to be a thoroughly fascinating story, and an enjoyable read by a debut novelist.Sidney Grayling, August 1, 2005"
4,Great for when you're on the go,"I bought this so my daughter could carry her own Leap Pad. It works great. There are slots inside for the cartridges. It would be nice if the inside were divided, but it's a great bag overall."
5,Utopia Parkway rules the house!,"This band rules! You will never hear a catchier CD than what Schlesinger, Porter, Collingswood and Young have put together. On guitar Jody Porter has an obvious talent. Also check out his side project, Astrojet if you have the chance."
5,Five stars are not enough,"I've gradually gotten to know this band, basically through Amazon recommendations based on my previous likes, and they are the best. This album is full of hooks and these guys deserve more recognition than they are getting. I can't get ""Amity Gardens"" out of my head. They have a very accessible sound and very clever lyrics. I'm hoping they'll be making much for years ahead."
2,A monotonous dragged out downer,"I loved the first album and was waiting for Utopia Parkway to come out. I gave this 2 stars because there are 3 good songs which come as Red Dragon Tattoo, Denise, and Laser Show which all have great sounds. I bought the album after hearing Denise because it had a sort of Rentals and Weezer (which have different sounds if you listen) feel to it and I hoped that the whole thing would have that great creativity which is seen in Red Dragon Tattoo, but all in all if you listen to the songs they are long and drawn out sleepers. I listened to the whole thing in a matter of maybe 10 minutes due to the lack of creativity which can be seen in the first album. Radiation Vibe, Leave the Biker, and Survival Car are all fantastic songs with a pop feel that pulls the album together, but the new album leaves me wanting lots more. Unless you are a die-hard fan of FoW or don't care about lyrics that drone on forever then please spend your money elsewhere."
4,"dont wait for the new pink, buy this instead","FOW are great musicians who right great pop music that still has some musicianship. it is not bubblegum. all pop, little flavor. it is strong songwriting, great vocals, beautiful melodies, strong arrangement and yet it is still a sight for sore ears. think brian wilson of the nineties or maybe elo for the alternative scene. wonderful stuff."
2,"Disappointing, very disappointing....","Their first album was brilliant, full of fantastic pop gems... this one is a bit of a disappointment to me, apart from the great smart-ass lyrics (the reason why this album didn't get one star). This album misses the infectious harmonies, the ultra-catchy, anthemic melodies and simple guitar accompaniment, which made the first album so great. They think fewer hooks and fewer catchy melodies can be compensated with bombastic kitsch (like the syrupy Prom Theme or Fine Day For a Parade), which simply doesn't work. They just don't sound as fresh as on their debut album.."
4,love this band,"I came across this band when a friend played ""Please don't rock me tonight"" for me, and I was completely hooked. I bought their debut album right away, and it was one of my greatest joys of the summer of '97. When UP came out I didn't buy it right away, but when I heard ""Amity gardens"" I knew I had to have this album too. Come on you guys, that is the song that stands out the most, even if Troubled times, A Fine day for a parade and Valley of malls also are great! And as a whole I think this album is better than their debut one. Buy it now!"
4,"Liked it, didn't love it","A good record with some absolutely terrific moments, namely ""Red Dragon Tattoo"" and the exquisite ballad ""Troubled Times"". But some of the songs seem like throwaways, with fairly weak hooks and even weaker lyrics. (""Denise"", ""Laser Show"" and ""Lost In Space"" come to mind). I love that they're attempting to revive the witty, guitar-based pop that I used to love, but their frequent attempts at making clever rhymes sometimes fell flat with me. And I found myself wishing that the guitars had a little more ""bite"" to them, a la the Cars and Cheap Trick.By the way, if you liked this one, I highly recommend ""Saturation"" by Urge Overkill, one of the overlooked treasures in 90s guitar pop."
4,near the fountains,"First the CD caught my eye because of the group's name -- I live a few minutes from THE Fountains of Wayne (it's a garden center on Rt.46 in Wayne, NJ that does sell fountains too) but when I sampled the tunes -oh my! - quite wonderful - I really like Valley Of Malls & Amity Gardens and now after reading these raves on here I must buy CD #1--- if it really is better I'll be very, very happy."
5,A tiny little cathartic escape,"This is one of the most infectious albums I've ever bought; it hasn't left my CD player since I bought it two years ago. Impossibly catchy and bouncy, it reminds me so much of the late, great TV show Freaks and Geeks--it brings back the sad, embarassing and happy memories of youth at the same, and yet you can't help but love it. Its a perfect antidote to the gloom of current reality."
2,Bummed out....,"I've been waiting for another release from FoW since their prior release, and I must say that I am sadly disapointed.This album does not have a ""Radiation Vibe"" or ""Leave the Biker"" type of song anywhere near it. Instead, its boring, boring, boring.I would urge everyone to not purchase this album and donate the money to your favorite charity instead."
3,"Reel Tight is tight,but not too much.","This single is alright,but not like a must-have single. I like the hip-hop versions of the song,but the slow versions are somewhat dull. But,basically what i'm sayin that if you don't like this group,then do not get this single."
2,Early lack of dialogue halts momentum,"This book is important to Canada because it represents an authentic view of small-town life in the pre-WW1 era. The novel focuses on Canada's economic and political link with England and religious issues. It also features 2 romances, the highlight of the novel.Unfortunately, this novel is neither 'lively' (as one early review stated) nor engaging by today's standards. Duncan's contrived view of the Murchisons and their world is difficult because one is constatly reminded that one is reading a novel. Duncan's characters act and do, they do not feel, think, or emote. The characters, plot, and setting are all contrivances that convey a subtly ironic, political message.In sum, I doubt very many people would be will to read this book for enjoyment nowadays, although it is still of Canadian historical importance."
1,Horrible meter,"Get any other meter but the true Track if you can help it. The True Track is the cheapest, and it is probably OK for someone who does not need consistently accurate results, but if you are pregnant or need to have tight blood glucose control you should get soemthing better. I work with pregnant women and some of them had insurance that would nnot cover any other meter exceopt True Track. We often compared them to other meters and to the meter we have in the clinic. the True Track meters usually (but not always) read 10-20% higher than the other meters, and occasionally read 30-40% higher. Occasionally they agreed with the other meters, but not nearly often enough!"
1,Completely inaccurate results,"I have been using the TrueTrack meter for almost a month. I kept wondering why my home results were so different than those of my doctor. So, we double tested in the office. This meter was anywhere from 125 to 200 mg/dl off! And that was the range of deviation from the real reading with the same blood sample tested three times within two minutes. The bad results resulted in Somogyi rebounds.Also, I constantly received errors with the monitor, and their customer service was useless.The device also shuts off quickly; so if you have to re-stick, you're going to have to restart the device. I even had it shut down while the test strip was sucking up the blood, which they are slow to do.Overall, I would give this negative five stars if I could."
1,poor accuracy,"I have been testing for 15 years. I recently switched to the True Test becaue the strips are cheaper. The results I got were amazingly varied. Test results were 25 to 50 points different minutes apart and I am very careful to wash hands, and follow exact directions. I took it back, got a refund and went back to a name brand. My results are now consistent. This whole industry is ripping us off on test strip prices, in my opinion, but I need accuracy. Good Luck."
3,A little disappointing.,"I was searching for a book that was a 'How To' on the details of setting up a small music publishing company --- this wasn't it. The title 'Music Publishing 101' gives the impression that there is enough information for a semester (or quarter or whatever) of study. (Maybe I should have paid more attention to the subtitle 'Crash Course.') I found only the very basic information that might, at most, take a couple of weeks to digest. About 1/4 of the book (mainly toward the end) seemed like filler material. Overall, I was disappointed."
4,USB Networking,"I found that this product made networking between 2 computers very easy. I set up and had the network running in less than 30 minutes from the time I opened the box. This is a great product but my only complaint is the speed. I wish it were 10 mbps, which this one is only 1."
4,Are You in the House Alone?,This book was a pretty good book. I read this book In class a couple of years ago. I liked this book alot and I still do. I would read it again. This book is about a young girl who needs the money so she becomes a babysitter and gets all these weird phone calls from some man who wouldn't tell her his name. She is scared but still continues to babysit for the same people because she and her family really need the money for basic things.She gets really scared and envites a friend over but when she opens the door it's not her friend it's someone else. I can't tell you the rest because their would be no point in reading the book now would it? I definetly think you should read this book because It's a good book.I give this book four stars.
1,"Boring book, very disappointed.","I am honestly not sure why this book has such a high rating on here. I was very disappointed. The beginning, middle, and end were all so boring! The rape scene didn't happen until almost 100 pages into the book, and the story was over at 156 pages. The characters were boring, and the entire story was lacking any decent description of anyone. I could never tell if it was supposed to be set in the early 1800's or in 2000. The characters spoke in weird terms, but then there was references to Star Trek? I couldn't properly picture anything and I was never sucked into the book. The worst part was there was no satisfaction. There was no happy ending. I know in rape stories, there hardly are, but there was no sense of closure whatsoever. I wouldn't waste my time reading this book. If you want a good story about rape or abuse, go read Speak, or A Child Called It. This book was just awful, and not in a good way."
2,Are you in the house alone?,"This book was on the fifth grade reading list at my sons school. Thinking it was a mystery he would enjoy, I purchased it for him. I was shocked to discover that it was about the rape of a young girl by a rich boy in her community. Then, not only is she raped by this boy, but also by society who would not allow her to press charges and see justice done. Why? Because he came from wealth and people wouldn't believe that he would have done such a thing. I feel that this book gives the message that young girls should not even bother to try and get help if wrongs have been done to them. This is the opposite message that we are telling them everyday, tell, tell, tell! Some one will help you. I found this book very disturbing reading for 5th to 8th grade readers."
4,"good, but kinda boring through some of it","this book was pretty good... i mean, they described everything well and the plot made sense. adults may find this book more interesting, because i am 14 and i thaught it was a tad on the boring side. all in all, though, it deserved four stars."
1,This book was bad.,"I admit that i am not big on reading but i love to get involved in a some what scary book. anyway,as an 8th grader i found this book very, very disturbing. I have no idea how someone could come up with such a story. i was very suprised to see so many people that liked this book because it was so sick. How could someone read a book about a girl that is being stalked and raped and find it interresting (not to mention she cant press charges because of money issues). It kind of makes me wonder about the socity i'm growing up in. i was very dissapointed in this book and would never read it again. My mother picked this book out for me to read for a school BOOK REPORT and i was very ashamed of doing the report for this book."
3,not my favorite Martian movie,"Comedy movies like the Cone Head one have given sci fi humor.Here with special effects the 60's sit com is revived.I just don't think they did the plot as well or the humor as tastefully?I think they could have probably benefited from a script re-writein which the sci fi was given a little less cheese and a little more science?I enjoyed the movie, but I guess I was glad I missed this one.when it came out."
4,Silly fun,"Some mindless fun aimed primarily at the younger audience, but fans of the old series will get a thrill with numerous references to the previous ""Uncle Martin"". A CG spacesuit is a scene-stealer, but there is enough going on to provide some ""don't ask questions just watch"" enjoyment."
5,Why do y'all think this is bad?,"I don't understand why everybody thinks that this is a bad movie. I thought it was very entertaining and especially the performance of Christopher Lloyd was outstanding. In this movie he is at his best! When I saw this movie, I didn't want to miss a thing of it and the only time I was disapointed was when it ended. This is just a fun movie for the whole family with some good Special FX and DON'T COMPARE IT WITH THE TELEVISION SERIES!"
4,Great family fun,"My family thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The antics of ""Suit"" were alone enough to make me want to watch this movie many times more. I would highly recommend this movie to any one young or old for a couple of hours of good, clean laughter."
1,I Nearly Cried,"Now I understand what Don Maclean is trying to say.'My Favorite Martian' was one of my favorite shows as a child. I looked forward to seeing how the movies would render it: but I must say I was sadly disappointed. This is a violent, over the top mess. The grotesque Christopher Lloyd has no charm as the Martian and Daryl Hannah needs to be in a slasher film to play out her twisted sensibilites. I do not know what the director was thinking about. Is everyone in Hollywood on some kind of mind zapping stimulant?This is supposed to be family entertainment? It has been appropriated by the dark side."
1,Miss this Martian,"I like Christopher Lloyd. From Star Trek three's Kruge to Taxi's Reverend Jim. The man is a great character actor. I like the classic Martian showHowever, this movie version is for the birds. It seems to recycle old ALF plots rather than cover any new ground.Jeff Daniels and a pre ""Kill Bill"" Daryl Hannah is wasted in this remake.I wont subject you to the worst stuff this film offers like a talking space suit with a mind of its own.The cameo by the original martian, Ray Walston is cute, but worthless in this drekBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
2,THIS IS AWFUL !!!,"This movie is a awful!there is one scene were a guy and a ladyand being arrested, so the ladyturns into a monsters, picks up one of the police officersand throws him into a big machine, blowing him to bits.Then she chases they other police officer,hwo is crying and screaming for her not to heart him,but instead she gobbles him up and farts after eating him (witch is not funny at all, and is quite morronic.)so, she blows one guy up, and turns the other oneinto a pile of ...poop, and does not even feel bad about killing2 innocent people!!!!!!!!!!!(even though the actress potrays a protaginist.)this is a mess."
2,should of been rated PG-13! This movie is stupid!,"This movie is an update of the TV series of the same name!The cast is OK, the special effects typically of the candy coated Disney studio! But be forewarned this movie should of been rated PG-13! it was sexual innuedo(sp), nudity and other things that made it a PG-13! To make it PG-13 you have to have nudity in it! I'm sorry to tell everyone that Jeff Daniels in nude in it! Plus this movie stuff from a Jar Jar Binks person! The alien wears this annoying suit I would love to get rid of him! This movie is stupid and dumb! If you really want to see this video,try your local library where it's always free to see the movies!"
1,one of the worst live action disney movie to date!!,"this movie is based loosly on the series of the same name.Other than that it is almost like watching disney current live action movie in theaters now. It suffers from ""Jar Jat Binks Sydrome""( in other person or thing that totally does nothying for the story) . In the case it is the suit the martian (Chrstopher Lloyd) wears!!after 5 minutes on screen ,i wanted to get rid of it.This movie is ok for teenagers ,but has nudity,innuedo and other sexual things!!just because it is Disney it is not always a g or pg movie!!maybe the general public should checking the disney network(aka ABC!!!) to see how disney is now just not making family fare anymore!!What is with the deal with ""My favorite Martians-Double feature"" on the DVD!!!?"
2,Lame-brained kiddy junk,"Very stupid, inept film. tries to be funny but just wasn't. Bad acting. So what are the redeaming factors? some cool creature effects, I guess. The various creatures&monsters; looked fairly good, I guess. I only remember one scene:A girl and a boy are being arrested, both protagonists, and in order to ivade this, the girl eats some martain gum which turns her into a giant green monster. After knocking out one of the guards, she eats the other one! man! she could have let him go but instead decided to chase him down and swallow him whole while he's still alive. What a horrbile fait! She then makes a comment about how this alien form 'Looks good for her hair'. She then removes the gum from her mouth and turns back into a human and has a relieved look on her face like she just did something good! and she doesn't feel bad she just digested a innocent man and turned him into feces! Is that a moral they want to teach kids?pitiful movie. Tasteless, boring and stupid."
2,"A review by George,e the 12-year-old critic,","""My favorite martian"" was released theatrically in 1999. The critics hated it and so did everyone else that saw it. After a brief theatrical run it was released on video and then quickly frogotten, never to see any future or special edition DVD. And with reason. It's a terrible film. Badly acted and everyone is terribly miscast."
5,Step-by-step Needlecraft Encyclopedia,This book is everything you ever want to or need to know about any kind of needle craft. Great book. It was a gift to me and I got it for my daughter.
3,Bought two,"Initially, I bought one for my sister. My only issue was that I had to bring it to my jeweler to have a bail put on. Otherwise, loved it. Thought it was unique and functional. Rated it four stars.So, I bought one for myself. Before I could wear it the magnifying glass fell out and chipped. I probably should have returned it, but I went to an optician to see if I could get another magnifying glass. (I am waiting.) Realized when the glass fell out that the workmanship was poor (perhaps just on mine... ): The glass quality wasn't as good as others I have; the magnifying glass itself had horribly raggedly edges and hadn't been seated in the pendant well (not flush, for example). We'll see what happens when I bring it to my jeweler to have the glass replaced; I assume he'll glue it in. Too bad. It is a unique and attractive design. Had this not happened on the second pendant I bought, I'd have rated this pendant higher."
3,"IT MAY TAKE SOME TIME, BUT IT'LL GROW ON YOU","I TOO BOUGHT THIS CD FOR TOP BILLIN', BUT THE REST SEEMS TO EVENTUALLY TAKE YOU IN AS WELL. THE LYRICS, AT TIMES, MAY SEEM A LITTLE WEAK, BUT THE OVERALL PRODUCT IS PRETTY DOPE. I CAN'T GIVE IT 5 STARS (CRIMINAL MINDED, GREAT ADVENTURES OF SLICK RICK) OR EVEN 4 STARS (BIGGER AND DEFFER,YO! BUM RUSH THE SHOW) SO 3 STARS SEEMS FITTING. IT'S DEFINATELY WORTH CHECKING OUT AND WILL STILL BE PLAYED IN MY RADIO NOW AND AGAIN. MILK D IS LOUD AND BOASTFUL (KINDA LIKE L.L.). IF YOU LIKE THAT '88 SOUND (DRUM MACHINES, ETC)AND AN OVERALL FUNKY SOUND, YOU SHOULD CHECK THIS ALBUM OUT!"
3,TOP BILLING,One song on here Top Billing is considered a classic the rest of the album is really boreing.
3,Decent for what it is... a comic book movie.,"I had some high expectations for this film... based solely on the casting of Chow Yun-Fat as the Monk. I'm a big fan. However, this is no where near being one of his better films. Also... Seann William Scott is NOT who I picture doing action hero stuff.However... this is a VERY GOOD adaptation of the original comic books. The theme is the same... and the characters are almost perfectly performed. There were a few changes... director's creatively license or what have you... but it was done right in that respect.So... if you're looking for a great Chow Yun-Fat film, then this probably isn't the film you're looking for. If you're a fan of the original comic series... or just looking for a fun action romp... then I'd recommend giving it a watch."
4,Our Family Highly Enjoyed Watching the Film Together,"My 10-year-old daughter chose this film as a rental, having seen part of it at a friend's house. She said, ""Mom, I know you'll love it!"" And I did. I have traveled extensively in Tibet, and anything Tibetan, or Buddhist, grabs my attention.As we live in Morocco, our version was dubbed in French. I was a bit surprised by some of the language, which I did not feel was appropriate for children, but now seeing the PG-13 rating, feel that this rating is appropriate.It wasn't the best film I've ever seen, but it definitely held my attention, and our whole family enjoyed it together."
3,Entertaining Fun Movie,"Bulletproof Monk is an entertaining and fun movie. The special effects of the actors walking on air is well done. Yun-Fat Chow is good in his role as the Bulletproof Monk, and a joy to watch on screen. Once you see the movie, you will understand the silly title of the movie, as it does fit. A guilty pleasure for a matinee."
1,Excuse me!!!,"I have only one point/question to put out there/here........if the scroll had so much potential for evil, why didn't they destroy it instead of protecting it? And memorizing the last verse? Excuse me,why bother?????????"
1,And Hollywood insults our intelligence once more!!!,"Worst movie I've seen in a long time. Full of cliches, bad acting (except for the amazing Chow yun Fat), not funny at all and with the worst seudo-martial arts ripoff ever!!! I'm not bull... you!, the movie is really bad!...I still don't know why Chow Yun Fat took this role...well probably the money, which makes me wonder on why does Hollywood hired such an incredible international action star like Chow Yun Fat for whatever amount of money if they're going to put him in such a dumb stupid movie that did not make a cent? Nazi gestapo, SS and the Wehrmacht in China (Tibet) in 1943...when did this happened??...What an incredible work of ignorance!!!! and you should see some of the action scenes or CGI work...wire Fu has never been so pathetic its horrible is beyond description...This movie is bad....really bad!"
4,"And the lesson is, be happy with what you have, you can always get a hotdog...Good action movie","Again, Seeing this with low expectations leaves one open to complete suprise when the movie isn't actually bad. This is a movie about a tibetan monk that is sworn to protect a secret magical scroll that hold unlimited power. Unfortunately, Those darn Nazis are after its power, and he spends 60 years protecting it from a Mad holdout Nazi. Finally, the battle spills over to the streets of modern new york, where the the Monk, Chow Yun-Fat, crosses trail with the young Pick pocket Kar, Shawn Willam Scott. Well, as one thing leads to another, Kar finds himself caught in this monks Battle, and has to figure out who he is. Yes, their are some great fight scenes in this movie, as well as a love story. Check this movie out, Its good entertainment. At least rent it, but not a bad movie to get for the collection either."
4,"Very entertaining, fun flick","This movie is not intended to be too deep, and at times, laughs at itself, but overall, it is very entertaining. Chow Yun Fat continues to show the breadth of his acting skills. The karate fighting is unbelievable (although much more believable than Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon!!). Overall, it is a fun movie that will make you laugh at times and really draw you into its storyline."
4,"Good ""Wire Fu""","I saw this movie expecting to see Chow-Yun Fat in a more lighthearted role and I was not disappointed. Do not see this film if you are expecting the cinematography of ""The Killer"" or ""Crouching Tiger."" This is not that type of film. This is a film that satisfies those of us who are not Kung-Fu ""purists"" and enjoy seeing the characters leap about and spring into the air. If you are one of those men who feel threatened when a female lead as an action character is given equal status as the male, you will probably not enjoy this film. The plot is not complicated or convoluted (just very simple), nor did I have problems with the foundation of the plot (Nazi Germany & World War II.)"
2,2 cents,"ok, is this movie pretty bad? yes. are all the negative things being said about it true? yes. however, i must admit that this movie is entertaining. even though we know how its gonna turn out. even though the plot and story line are pretty lame. i finished watching this movie and did not feel an empty void of wasted time like i get from other bad movies. with all the ratings systems out there i have come up with one which is very simple. 4=buy the dvd, 3=rent the dvd, 2=wait for tv, 1=dont bother, 0=not worth mentioning. this movie would be a 2, don't spend any money on it but catch it when its on cable."
1,Incoherent nonsense,"It's a shame that Chow Yun-Fat's American movie career has been mainly made-up of underwhelming actioners such as this or Replacement Killers. Bulletproof Monk is amateur-hour from beginning to end.Chowy plays a Buddhist monk tasked with guarding a sacred scroll. The Nazis want their hands on it, but as long as he is the guardian he is immortal. The movie flashes forward from 1943 to 2003 Canada substituting for New York, where Chowy is still fleeing the last surviving Nazi. He meets up with Kar (a bored Sean William Scott) and Jade, a bad girl, and they involve themselves in 104 minutes of utterly incomprehensible trash.The film is ugly to look at, filled with drab, muted color schemes and dreary production design. The acting is appalling, the dialogue is awful, and the action poorly-edited and completely unexciting.Apparently it's based on an underground comic-book. It should have been an underground movie. Utter trash!The DVD looks absolutely terrible too."
2,Amusing...sort of.,"Being a huge fan of the Shangai Noon/Knights movies, three coworkers and I went on opening day to see Bulletproof Monk. Even though we went in with LOW expectations, we were still disappointed.Yes, there were high points and some funny lines. However, as the closing credits rolled, so did our eyes. All four of us agreed that a slow afternoon at work would have been better.If you want to see this movie, I can only recommend it as a Friday night rental on a rainy weekend. And I won't be including it in my DVD collection.As for the number of hot dogs vs. number of buns analogy/joke? It has been done&#65533; and been done much better. If you want to see the ""meaning of life"" idea carried out through a movie, watch City Slickers with the ""one thing"" idea. (It's a better movie anyway!)"
1,Stupid,"Bulletproof Monk was a bad movie. He only gets shot once. A normal person can survive a pistol bullet if it hits them in a non organ spot. The monk had mystical writing on his stomach and after he trains this person to guard a scroll the letters come off the monk and go to the person he trained. The ""Monk"" had hair so he coulnt have been a monk. It was so cheasy too. The monk could jump in the air and spin aroound for a minuit and he could balence on a rope witout even moving at all. Dont even rent the movie."
3,"Yeah, but I think its a bit of fun","Sure, not the best thing you could watch, but I think it is more fun and enjoyable than 2-stars. So don't expect even an average Kung-Fu film as it's more of a ""buddy"" action-comedy. I actually like it better in some ways than the Rush Hour films, though I'd rate them a bit higher for overall quality. But, as ""buddy"" films go, this is different and fun enough to rate a '3'. What is strange, and I cannot exactly explain why, is that I rather enjoy watching this over the Rush Hour films."
4,Bulletproof makes the mark !,"Bulletproof Monk simply makes the mark. Chow Yun Fat is the perfect pickfor the humble monk who packs a punch. Along with Seann William Scott,the duo make for a light-hearted yet action packed adventure fightinga Nazi cult and a gang of street thugs while trying to protect an ancient secret.A must see movie that I think you will enjoy."
3,Spoofy hidden dragon wan-a-be,"Monk With No Name (Chow Yun-Fat, of Pirates of the Caribbean fame) for 60 years he is being perused by a member (Karel Roden) of the NSPD (National Socialist German Workers' Party.) In his escape, he runs into a potential replacement or two. Lots of made for TV type pseudo-martial arts, Skillful females as well, the monk gets a body part bit by the bad guy (you can say he was chewing the fat.)There is lots of action from gravity defying twists to overkill helicopters. Therefore, you can see that money has been thrown at this film. Too bad, it is so mediocre. However, for people that keep up with cultural literacy this film is a must for people that read the comic book.I only watched the Blu-ray version so I cannot compare to other versions."
1,"Got it for free, and felt I had spent too much.","I got this movie for free in a buy two get one free type of deal (couldn't find a third I really wanted, so took a shot with this).First off, the dialogue is so bad it is almost painful to listen too. Granted, I expected as much and, for the most part, got the movie because I heard it had good action scenes. Wrong. The action scenes were mediocre at best, and they seemed few and far between as well. (I don't know why they picture Monk with guns on the cover anyway. He uses them once and spends the majority of his time running away rather than fighting.)To sum up, I'm quite frankly embarassed to have this movie in my possession. Maybe I'll donate to the local library so other people curious about this trash may only have to waste their time and not their money as well."
2,"At times quite bad, other times tolerable","This movie was fine, and nearly tolerable to watch, except when the villain was around. Then it got really bad. We're talking scooping your eyeballs out with a wooden spoon bad. Whoever decided that this movie needed an evil German nazi that was evil as much as he was annoying should leave Hollywood forever. This villain was worse than John Travolta's character in ""Battlefield Earth."" This movie could have been done better without a villain at all. Addition by targeted subtraction.However, Chow Yun-fat was great, carried the film, other acting parts were so so, except for the person who I won't even try to look up who played the nazi villain. Action was enough to keep me from doing something more productive. See it if you're also trying to avoid productivity."
1,not even one star!,WOW what a crappy movie! Stifler should know better. nothing redeeming about this moive. Im so glad a freind lent it to me!
1,hands down the worst movie of the year,"Bad acting, lousy storyline ('boroughing' from Matrix, Indiana Jones and the rest of the action movie genre didn't add up to something appealing . . . . ), action scenes not believable at all - where are the negative stars? Don't bother to try and watch this one, it's basically unwatchable. Not even my teenage son likes it. I want my money back."
3,It's not great but the actors make it fun,"Bullet Proof Monk is a silly but fun movie. It's fun mostly because Chow Yun-fat and Sean William Scott. Yun-fat is charming, funny and a good actor. He maybe too good for bad material like this but he makes the best out of it just like he did with the Replacement Killers. The movie seems more like something Jackie Chan should be in and isn't worthy of Chow Yun-Fat's talent especially after Crouching Tigar, Hidden Dragon. When I say it seems more like something Jackie Chan would do I mean it's sorta like Shang High Noon. It never takes itself seriously and as well it shouldn't. The story is silly as is all the flips and bullet dodging but it's all fun as well and Chow Yun-fat and Sean William Scott make it work. I just found it hard not to like because Chow and Scott work well together and they make it worth sticking with."
1,Didn't expect much from this thing but..,"You are paying $18 + shipping for the little light that lasts about 30 minutes.and extra batteries that you need is the one that goes into watch - expensive ($7 at Savon Drugs.)Yes, it's quite bright. But it's useless.It doesn't extend your visual range. It may help you when you're in total darkness at the expense of $7/30 minutes.It's simply consist of bright LED (that you can buy at Fry's electronics for $3.00) and two batteries.Totally doesn't worth it."
2,Setlist??,Why in the world would anyone want to buy one of these Baby Boomer Classics discs without seeing a track list???
4,SOME GOOD STUFF,"Mr. Vandenberg, currently guitarist for Whitesnake, use to have his own band properly named Vandenberg, during the early to mid 80's. Cranking out NWOBHM music, Vandenberg and co. amounted big success in Europe and Japan but were virtually unheard in the States. And thats to bad, because their is some fine music here. Songs like Alibi, Pedel to the Metal, Wait and Welcome to the Club all rock out better than most bands of that genre were playing at that time. Also, the power ballad Burnin' Heart makes this collection worth owning. Besides, this is the only disc of Vandenberg music available in the States, otherwise you can pay big for imports. This is all of the Vandenberg you will ever need."
3,Contains some good rockers.,"This collection of songs from Vandenburg isn't bad. I've had the cassette for some time and still give it a listen every once in a while. I don't think that most of the songs are that original or memorable, but they still have good energy and are listenable. Adrian Vandenburg plays very well indeed; and while I'm not big on the vocalist, he still gets the job done. My favorite tunes are ""Burning Heart"" and ""Different Worlds."" ""Burning Heart"" would have to be the most memorable song of this collection--the guitar intro is very good. Vandenburg put out some decent melodic hardrock. Worth a listen."
3,"Decent, but not first rate",Basically Burning Heart and Wait really did anything for me. Reminds me a lot of Whitesnake or XYZ.
1,broken cases again - no reaction,"i've received 2 cds, out of 10 - without any notice.Moreover, the 2 cd cases are broken so requested for new ones but no reply so far. It's been almost 2 weeks now.Really don't wanted to say this but bad product and bad service!!"
4,rim lockset,"Not the best quality, but the price reflects that. Annoying that to reverse the latch direction, the instructions say only ""reverse latch"". In reality, the latch is not concentric, would jam without filing the guides and casting mold lines to allow it to actually move in the reversed direction. Worked fine after that. If I had to do it again I'd buy the next level of quality so that on-site rework was not required."
4,Great book,"This book is definately outdated but has some valueable advice for anyone considering relationship with a russian man or a women. I quite enjoyed it and it definately brought back some memories.I couldn't help but feel sympathetic towards one of the reviewers who is obviously been burned by a bad marriege with a russian woman. Not every russian woman is ready to murder and sacrifice everyone for the ""greater good"". I think that particular viewer doesn't understand the russian mindset at all. Most russian women are much harder and much more ruthless than any american women. Lot of it has to do growing up in a enviroment that didn't allow you to be a sissy. I think for some american men this can be quite a shock. If submissive is what you are looking for DON'T MARRY RUSSIAN WOMAN! We tend to be agressive and sharp tongued(among other things). However, if you are looking for someone smart, well educated, good looking and loyal, russian woman may be for you. Good luck!"
1,Outdated Book Before The Internet,"I bought the book and was let down about how dated the stories were during the days of the Iron Curtain. The book dedicates only one real chapter to the issues that have faced couples meeting since the fall of the Soviet Union and impact of the internet.Secondly the book almost exclusively deals with the marriages of childless couples. To ignore the impact of children from the Former Soviet Union, coming with their Mom in a package deal, is to underestimate the challenges of the marriage and the stress it will place on the relationship.Lastly while the book is collection of stories, it offers little advice and mostly annidotes. The ""Culture Shock"" books on Amazon and internet articles were far more helpful to prepare me for the challenges of this type of marriage."
4,A Must-Read for Russian / American Relationships,"Although the book was mostly about Russian Relationships prior to the breakup of the Soviet Union,I found this book of very much help in understanding a lot of cultural differences between myself and my new Russian family. The Author gave a Seminar at the local college this past summer. I wish I could have attended."
3,Updated information,"Several reviewers mentioned the hope of finding a Russian Language translation. Here is the link: http://lexiconbridge.com/books/vissoner.htm. It is available from Lexicon Bridge Publishers for $14.95. It has a different Cover, so do not be concerned."
2,"Good idea, poor realization",The book catches attention because it's one of the very few books on this topic. However it leaves an impression of a raw material rather than a well organized study. The book needs more structure. Gender differences are often overlooked and replaced with cultural differences. Mrs. Visson may be able to do a more thorough study based on this material for the next edition or a new book.
2,I only read half.,"This book was a BIG disappointment. The best I can say about it is that it is a rich, well-arranged collection of anecdotes, both historical and contemporary. It undoubtedly took a lot of time and effort to put together. Unfortunately, it is nothing more than a collection of anecdotes, and it reinforces many stereotypes (e. g., golddigging _fartsovchiki_ [black marketeers]). It would probably be interesting to anyone who has never been to Russia and doesn't know any Russians personally. I lived in Russia for two years before I married my Russian husband, and I was expecting delicious insight from someone who has had similar experiences."
2,Not much going on here.,"""Universally Speaking"" was the fourth single off the Red Hot Chili Peppers' ""By the Way"" in Europe. It saw release in two parts, this part (with the face closeup rather than the half body picture) and includes one b-side, an instrumental ""Slowly Deeply"" and a video track for ""Universally Speaking"".The title track is an exciting alt-pop song, not the sort of thing you'd expect from the Chili Peppers ten years ago, but still phenomenally good. With a driving rhythm and a clever arrangement soaked in vocal harmonies, strings, and organs, it shows just how far the band has come over the years.""Slowly Deeply"" is decent, but truth to be told it feels like a demo. It's nto bad, but it's not worth going out and getting unless you need to have it. The video I'm kind of whatever about, I don't ask a rule buy CDs for videos. this one is really of quite limited value."

5,"A Classic Paper on Big Bone Lick, Kentucky",This paper is well worth reading and should be made more widely available. We are trying to get it back in print along with many more items of similar value and interest.
2,poor text,very dense and hard to read text. If you are a beginner in neuroanatomy this would not be a good book for you. It is more of a review instead of a primary source for learning neuroanatomy
2,Not ideal for the first time Neuro Student,"This text was assigned by my Neuro prof for Neuroanatomy in medical school. It is dense, hard to read through, and is not an enjoyable read by any stretch. Use this book as a reference, but for a much better read, go for Lange neuro board review book."
3,A book only for review of neuroanatomy,"We used this book as a reference of our neuroanatomy course. Actually, most neuroanatomy textbooks are not so easy to read. This one is no exception. It only ""describes"" the nuclei and tracts without giving an understandable explanation. In addition, only brief review can we found in the portion of systemic neuroanatomy, and NEVER can we found any information about development neuroscience. So I don't think this book is apt to strangers of neuroscience. But for those who have some basic knowledge in the field of neuroanatomy. It is a excellent book for brief review."
3,Not what I was looking for,"Christmas Memories is a beautiful book with typically lovely Susan Branch style, which I love ! However, I was looking for something with more decorating/craft ideas than this has. I showed it to my mom and she was crazy about it Sooooo- guess who gets the book and gets to enjoy journalling about Christmas activities.All in all -- this worked out great ! I ended up with a cool present for my Mom."
3,terrific video,Enjoyable but cinematography was B- at best. Would have liked to see it a bit longer for the price tag.
2,"Interesting, but written in the style of a bland high school history book","If you're a fan of the characters in this book, you'll enjoy reading it. The author's writing style is very simple and matter-of-fact. You'll learn a lot about the band's history. However the book is mostly a time line of events. It offers no insight into the people involved and avoids a lot of obvious questions that a reader and fan would have asked the people involved. For the most part, personal lives are actually left out of it. Major characters like Bill Thompson remain an enigma. Snippets of interviews with everyone involved are spread throughout and I'm left wondering if it would have been more interesting to just read transcripts of those interview sessions rather than the time line presented in this book.This book could have been so much more."
5,"the real ""behind the music""","I've long been a huge fan of the music and I'd heard stories over the years of how crazy (with substances and by themselves) the members of the Airplane had been. Tamarkin's book lays it all out -- the dirt (and some of the stories are really hilarious) as well as the genius of this seminal '60s band.Unlike a lot of tell-all ""Behind the Music""-style exposes, this author clearly loves -- and understands -- the music. It's just that he also gets the people who made it, and often made a mess in the process."
5,Jefferson Airplane story...,As a 60's person I purchased most of their music in my youth on LP (Long Playing Records); as a matter of fact all of it. It actually started when I heard my younger sister's Surrealistic Pillow LP.... They were different for the times and you had to have an ear for their music. Next to the underrated group Moby Grape (my all-time favorite) Jefferson Airplane had a way of intertwining their guitars and bass that made you take notice. This is an excellent read....
4,Great history lesson,"I've always loved the music of the early Airplane, but I didn't know much about the people in the group, their history and what they were about. I really appreciate their music much more now, and understand the stories I've heard over the years about the personality clashes of the band members and their escapades. Also this book had the added benefit of giving great insights into the other bands and music of the time."
3,The Turbulent flight of Jefferson Airplane,"Informations on the band are great, but lacks to my view more on San Francisco's scene, politically and socially, Diggers for example."
5,The Perfect Review Book,This book drew the line at what I actually needed to know and what was unimportant for the AP Test. I feel that it helped me review all the major points and really contributed to my performance on the exam.
3,It's good..except for the lab review,"Upon writing the exam today, I breezed through the multiple choice easily. I haven't gotten my results yet, but I'm hoping i got a 4.This book has really clever ways to help you memorize things, but its might not go into enough detail for the labs. DO USE this book to save you some pain and time, but I would also suggest to you to get some other external source for the taxonomy section, which I thought was quite poorly organized. The NEW Barron's (the one that's a new edition, not my Edwards and Cimmino) was WAY better with the examples given for essay questions which is worth 40% of your mark. The essay questions on the actually exam CAN be very difficult and vary every year, so don't let it lead you to believing that multiple choice is the most important."
1,Couldn't get this to transfer data.,"There wasn't a HotSync button, and I couldn't get it to transfer data otherwise. It wasn't useful for me."
5,Excellent Mixer Console!!!,The BEHRINGER XENYX 1204FX MIXER 12-INPUT 2/2-BUS w/EFX & USB is a GREAT console for the price! It has every feature that it advertises! Works like a champ. I've had it on since it arrived (I webcast 24/7) and it hasn't had a glitch! It has excellent sound quality and clarity.Highly recommended from someone who has experience with various consoles and brands such as Mackie and Midas.
4,Behringer mixer,"I bought this at a local ""Guitar Center"" store and have nothing to say but great things about it. It's small, solidly built and really delivers. The mic preamps are clean and quiet, which is what I was originally looking for. Perfect for remote recording or podcast production."
2,caller ID is difficult to use,I had this phone but needed to replace it when it got pulled off the counter. I am just as glad to replce it because I do not like the caller ID. It is difficult to read and to manipulate to the number just called. Erasing numbers takes more time than on our old caller ID. I will look around for another phone to replace this one.
2,Disapponted,"I really like panasonic phones in general - I have 2 cordless phones & an answering machine which are panasonic. When I went looking for a corded phone with caller id, I was excited to find this one - the size and design were exactly what I was looking for. However, the display is difficult to read unless you're standing above it and the caller id feature is lacking. Specifically, I found that I cannot recognize cell phone numbers - it displays them as ""out of area"" with no number attached to them. By contrast, my other panasonic cordless phone displays ""out of area"" AND the phone number for cell phones. This is important because I like to distinguish between telemarkets and my friends with cell phones. With this phone, I can't."
1,Broken as Designed...,"I got this phone and promptly returned it. The problem was that theCaller ID didn't work when I called in on my Verizon cell phone. Iknow for a fact that the Caller ID is coming through, since I see iton other phones (including other Panasonic phones!), but this one justsays OUT OF AREA. Broken as designed. I ended up getting an AT&T;Model 858. It's a shame there are so few options in traditionalcorded phones that keep up on the newer features. I was loyal toPanasonic for a long time but not anymore."
3,It's okay,I sent this to someone as a gift so they could be able to communicate during the many power outages in their city. Cordless phones are worthless during a time like that. They like it okay. I dont regret buying it because I like the Panasonic name. I'd buy one for myself if my husband hadn't bought a different phone. At this point i am just chit chatting. I apologize for not being more helpful. I wont do this type of review again...promise.
1,Kelsysus Portable Hammock,"Wow, I read both mixed reviews for this product and obviously I went with the positive feedback. I was very excited to open the box. I put it together sat on it for about five minutes and wrapped it back up for another day. I set up the hammock about a week or so later while traveling on vacation. All excited to take my first relaxing nap, I set it up per the directions again and proceeded to enjoy my first portable hammock nap. The reviews will not allow me to publish all of the things that came out of my mouth in the next few minutes of my second time on the hammock. As others have listed in reviews. I am not a large man. 5'9 and 180lbs and this hammock didn't last ten minutes. Both support leg collapsed like Bambi on ice. That was my last time on it and I hope some reads the review and listens to the negative reviews like I did not. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
1,Should've given more credence to the reviews...,"I read the reviews and they were fairly split. I read reviews on other sites and they seemed to be more in favor than opposed. I bought this for my boyfriend who is about 220lbs and 6' 4"" for his birthday. We opened it in the dining room and it seemed to be an easy set up. He laid on it to ""try it out"" and we packed it up for him to take camping. He left for his camping weekend and upon first use, the bar supporting the hammock broke. It's unfortunate that it was poorly constructed because he was very excited to receive this and it was a good size for his larger frame."
5,Kelsyus Hammock...I Love It.,"I recently got a Kelsyus XL Hammock after trying a friends standard Kelsyus Hammock. After taking it with me on a trip, the hammock ""A"" peice broke during transportation. I called Swimways (Kelsyus parent company) to purchase a replacement part. In 5 days, they sent me a new part (No Charge-No questions asked). Not only is the Kelsyus Hammock comfortable and easy to transport...the company support is unbelievable and second to none. I highly recommend the Kelsyus Hammock...and to that matter any product by Kelsyus and Swim Ways."
5,Exactly as expected,"After reading several other marginal reviews, I was a little hesitant to order this item. But with an upcoming camping trip and my wife's great love of hammocks, I decided to give it a shot, and I was very happy. The item came in great shape with a wonderful carry bag, and ""sewn in"" instructions, which is good because I tend to lose paper ones. While setting this up is extremely easy, taking it down takes a little care and reading the instructions are a must. We have had this out on several trips and it has been in use for upwards of 20 hours, with no problems and no sign of wear. I would highly recommend this to anyone, especially those looking for a compact, comfortable, weight bearing portable hammock."
1,Piece of Junk,"I got one today. I was so excited. It states if is for 300 lbs. Well I weigh 207 and it did not hold my weight. It was a piece of junk. I laid on it with no problem, I got off my 8 year old got on it(watching him the whole time). He got off and I got back on it and it broke.I am so sad."
4,Comfortable and easy to set up!,I bought this item in place of a bed. I weigh over 200 pounds and have been sleeping on it for under a month now with no issues. It is very easy to take it down and put it up. It is sturdy and holds me comfortably. I am happy with the purchase and would recommend it to people to use. It is also big to hold a tall man like myself. Good product!
1,Waste of Money,"I did some research on portable hammocks. I chose this one due to some good reviews and really did not pay too much attention on the bad ones. Big mistake! After reading the other bad reviews, I pretty much had the same experience. I was excited when it was delivered. I opened the box, followed the instructions, and seemed to work well the first time. I was able to lay on it and relaxed. A little difficult folding it back but got the hang of it after awhile. I was looking forward to using it again one sunny Saturday afternoon but the folding frame just collapsed right after I set it up and laid on it. I will try to call Swimways Customer Service to see if they would replace it. Otherwise, I will just have to go through the hassle of returning the product. I will continue to look for other more reliable products out there. Any suggestions?"
1,hammock,"The stand is great,but the hammock ? I damn near touch my chest with my knees.Luckily I have a friend with a sewing machine so I can fix it."
4,The best of the DISCO albums so far.....,"This album in the DISCO series of remix albums for PSB has to be one of their best. POSITIVE ROLE MODEL and the Blank and Jones remix of HOME AND DRY have to be the best ones on this disc. Yes, the album RELEASE was a bit of a let down, but Tennant and Lowe try to make up for it here. The only disappointing thing about this EP is that it was just too short. They should have gone on and made it into a full-length album of danceable hits. Oh well, we will take what we can get! I just hope that the new songs MIRACLES and FLAMBOYANT from the overseas release POPART will make their way Stateside on the next PSB US release. Until then, enjoy DISCO 3. It's a good dance compilation....sure to get those feet hoppin' in the clubs!"
5,"GOOD OLD PSB, BACK TO THEIR ROOTS!","What can I say? I'm basically speechless in a good way because Disco 3 is brilliant! I love the new songs especially ""Time onmy hands"", ""Somebody else's business"", ""If looks couldkill"", ""Try it"" and love the remix of ""Here.""The Boys get better over time, just like wine tastes better over time. The remix of ""London"" is nice, a calm way to end the album after all the fast songs, thumping bass and catchy lyrics. I definitely recommend this album to all PSB fans whoappricate the Boys and even for those who thought the boyshave disappeared like other 80s artists, they still have what it takes to write amazing music. Its too bad they don't play them more on the radio here in Canada, I can't stand the radio and all those [hopeful] artists they play, who can't even write their own music or even play an instrument.... Anyways I think the boys have what it takes to write amazing music and I hope they continue for as long as possible!!"
2,"Not awful, not wonderful","A bit of a disappointment when compared with previous PSB albums. The album previous to this, ""Release"", took a while to grow on to me, and while some of its songs still don't work, most of the album is quite enjoyrable. This follow up to ""Release"" is more of a disappointment than a joy. PSB has more talent than this, and are losing touch with their trademark successful dance formula of the past.This is better than ""Disco 2"", which was a disaster. But the original ""Disco"" was amazing. PSB had the potential to surpass the brilliance of ""Disco"" with ""Disco 3"", but they failed to deliver.And to top off the disappointment, this is wrapped in one of those cheap cardboard covers that should only be used for singles, if at all."
2,"""Disco 3"" Lacks Groove","An album for die-hard fans only. Although the title is ""Disco,"" I find it difficult to believe any of these songs would pull someone to the dance floor. (I guess most of these tracks, recorded during the ""Release"" sessions, were omitted from that disc for a reason.) While the extended mix of ""Here"" is a solid addition, much of the album tries to pass off endless electronic bleeps and burps as groove-enducing. Instead, it's like listening to a parade of dub mixes; vocals are lacking on many of the songs. When did the Boys lose their sense of melody? Flacid is probably an apt album description. While the album is priced to sell, I recommend you save your money and pull out one of the old PSB discs instead. Two thumbs definitely down."
2,Poor Efforts,"If you have all their previous singles, like LONDON, HOME AND DRY or you own most of their albums, like I do as a great fan since 1986. However, this EP is rather disappointing.Get it ONLY if you REALLY have to. Otherwise, forget it. Get those singles. The special remixes for SEXY NORTHENER (Superchumbo Mix) and LONDON (Thee Radikal Blaklite Edit) are BIG disappointment. Don't be fool by these 2 remixes which we can get them else where."
1,Pet Shop Boys Release a Bad Sequel,"Neil Tennant and ""the boys"" have really lost it. Their last two albums, ""Nightlife"" and ""Release"" have been a gradual downslide to this complete rock-bottom bad-sequel release ""Disco 3."" From a group that has released dance tunes over the years with such great tracks as ""Absolutely Fabulous,"" ""So Hard,"" etc., this new album sounds void of melody, inspiration, and substance. They're no longer ""boys"" as their title suggests. There is only one gem on this release, the last track, a piano version of the song ""London"" from the ""Release"" album. But, the rest of the water is sterile, trancey and devoid of any of the character that PSB once displayed. As a long time fan, I'm extremely disappointed. ""Disco 2"" was great, but version three is just a bad sequel. I recommend PSB's album ""Very"" and especially the re-release version with a Disc 2 of remixes."
2,Another dull night of club music...,"What a snore...where are the great catchy pop tunes I know these guys are capable of? They sure aren't on this cd! It's more boring dance music that goes nowhere fast. I'm their number one fan, but I really am getting tired of this junk. The Boys are brilliant, but you'd never know if from this cd."
5,Better than Disco2,"i think this is better disc than the last ""Release"".Is more to than because the last one was for have a sleep in your bed while you are listen to it.the best songs are ""somebody else's busyness"" that if you put on the volumene to max you will be exited!and i love to ""here"" the new extended mixt... but the best song i have ever hear from a mix is ""home and dry"" is better than be in a discotequeis exiting...i love itplease if you read that revieW please buy it"
5,Fantastic!,"While 'Disco' was great and 'Disco 2' a huge disappointed I bought this with trepidation, although I had read some early positive reviews. What I found was a truly fantastic album that can easily stand on its own ... I've listended to virtually nothing else on my iPod for weeks! The mixes and new tracks sit side by side in driving, beating, storming way; opening with a dark 'Time on My Hands' though a fabulous mean 'Try It' and to 'Sexy Northerner' with its great underlaying beat. My faves though are the dancefloor stormers 'Here' and 'Home and Dry' - both given superlative treament these tracks just make you wanna get up and dance. OK 'Disco 3' may not be unique and original, but it's a great achievement and a much played addition to my PSB library."
4,Much Better Than Expected,"When I heard that PSB were coming out with Disco 3, I was pretty disinterested even though I'm a huge fan. I have to say that this is a quality release from the Boys. The new songs are all very good, they don't sound like b-sides or leftovers.Somehow, it all sounds current and retro at the same time. The ability to manage that is pretty amazing.""Here"" is the standout fabulous remix from the ""Release"" sessions. ""Home and Dry"" is the most tedious, and was already on the bonus of ""Release."" Also, ""Sexy Northerner"" would have been better had it included more vocals. The slow version of ""London"" is quite beautiful.How many other groups are still able to produce quality material 20 years into recording?"
4,Disco Release,"Pretty good Disco compnaion to their most recent album, Release. There are some nice pounding cuts here and certainly this CD lets the boys show off their roots. The verions of London are both really good here. The Boys' Disco CDs have always been a little odd to rate since sometimes the question is, ""why bother?"" But, here if you bought the 2 CD version of release that questions rings a little more loudly than before. At any rate, why bother: cuz if you are a fan, any stretched-out, remixed, revamped, dubbed version of an album cut is still a gem."
2,Not much to hear,"Long intro's into the songs, all same type. London the last track is about all this C.D is worth buying for. Would not advise purchasing"
2,"Disco 3, Pet Shop Boys 0",Thumpa thumpa thumpa thump. Cheesy vocodor effect. Thumpa thumpa thumpa thump. Bleah. The Boys' always dubious Disco franchise just hit rock bottom.
4,why hasn't anybody reviewed this yet?,"Being the big PSB fan I am, I bought the cd the day it came out and I wasn't disappointed. I'd consider it to be a 5 star effort from the Boys, if they had not included the ""London"" remixes (the first remix is particularly dreadful) and the horrible ""Sexy Northerner"". The rest of the songs are pretty terrific. My favorite, the Depeche Mode influenced ""Somebody Else's Business"" is the new ""Can You Forgive Her?"" Chris Lowe fans will shake their heads appreciatively when hearing ""Time on My Hands"". ""Positive Role Model and ""I'm in Love with a Married Man"" are undeniably catchy. Overall, a great effort from the Boys!"
3,give it up,"I'm a big PSB fan, but this really doesn't cut the mustard. Play this to anyone unfamiliar with PSB and they yawn and/or leave the room - the music sounds dated and tired, even though I still enjoy it. I will be sorry the day they hang up their synths, but PSB now provide ever-diminishing returns.To compound the (relative) insult, the copies available in Australia are copy-protected, so ensure yours (if you decide to buy) is not: my U.S. version isn't copy-protected. Shame on PSB for endorsing this restriction of consumer rights!"
4,If Only Some Albums Were As Long,"Clocking in at almost 60 minutes long, the new Pet Shop Boys' ""e.p."" Disco 3, runs longer than most albums I've heard as of late. What's more, is that Disco 3 isn't just a release of remixes; the five of which are done very well. Disco 3 also contains five ""new"" songs, a couple of which are almost twenty years old...they have since evolved to what you hear on D3. Positive Role Model, which was available as an mp3 on the bands website in early 2001, brings the boys back to basics. Those of you who were disappointed with last years ""Release"" should find Disco 3 a welcome ""return to form"" though as The Pet Shop Boys would be the first to say, it can't be a come back if you never left."

3,good cd,"origin is a good band, one of the few i know of that has a drummer doing gravity blasts (jaw-dropping speed). but the drum beats are pretty much the same in every song, the guitar work is technical and fast, but everything (other than vocals) is kinda drowned out by the constant double bass (i think their drummer might have robotic legs and forearms) the vocals are good, but i would like it more if he didn't always blurt out tons of words per breath. this cd is very good if you're in the mood to listen to some of the most insane death metal you might ever hear, but origin needs to work on chaging up their tempos and lower the volume just a little on the bass drum."
3,Senior Slump?,"I haven't been a fan of Origin for that long, but after hearing all there previous albums, and seeing one of there shows, I must say it's a slight disappointment.As some of you may know, this is Origins fourth album, there most popular of which being, Informis Infinitas Inhumanitas.In this album it seems as if all 9 songs are connected, I'm sorry to say the lyrics are what seems separates every song from the other. Being a huge speed metal fan, it is normal to expect a lot of similarities between the songs, but this is beyond the point of reasonable. The only song that stands out is ""Reciprocal"", which is in my opinion a 5-Star song.Having said all of this, if you have some other Origin albums, I would advise you to buy this, as it does have its moments. If you do not have the other Origin albums, I would advise buying a different one to start out with, as this is definitely not there best work."
4,Better than most,"Just picked this up the other day so I haven't had much of a chance to listen to this yet but so far what I've heard is pretty solid. That being said, I have to say that I prefer Origin's previous effort, ""Informis Infinitas Inhumanitas"" to this one. All in all, I think this will probably end up being one of the better metal releases this year and surely if you like this style of metal, you can't go wrong with this album. Between this album, the new Dark Tranquility album and the forthcoming Meshuggah album, ""Catch 33"" (amazing disc, just heard a promo copy of it yesterday!), 2005 is looking like a not completely crappy year for music."
2,Track Listings,"1. Baby It's You (Feat. Bow Wow)2. Leave (Get Out)My opinion: do not get this single. Get the other baby it's you uk import. It includes Baby it's you, a remix of it, and 2 remixes of Leave (Get Out)"
2,There's No Substitute for Writing Skills,"I feel bad saying anything critical about this book, since it's obviously written with love and care. But. . .it's also a testament to an important truth: even if you have a fascinating family, even if you have good stories to tell about them, even if you have an interesting (though not fully convincing) premise -- it's all for naught if you can't write. And Ms. O'Connell, bless her, really cannot. There are so many significant grammar errors, disorganized and under-developed paragraphs, confusing transitions, and badly-identified quotations that at times I simply could not follow the text. Even when the meaning was clear, the errors were such a distraction that I couldn't finish.And why do so few of the photos have captions? It would be helpful to have some names, dates, places, contexts."
3,"A Chatty, Informal Family Biography","A chatty, informal biography of Alma Reville Hitchcock by her daughter, Pat Hitchcock O'Connell, the book is as much about her father, director Alfred Hitchcock, as it is about her mother. Lots of behind-the-scenes details about the movies both Hitchcocks worked on. Many family pictures, especially of Alma and daughter, Pat. Apparently Alfred much preferred being behind the camera at home, as well as on the film set. A pleasant, leisurely read."
1,Save your money,"As a great Hitchcock fan, I really looked forward to this book. However, it reads like a high school freshman's term paper and the only really interesting thing you learn about Alma is that she was petite. If you want a list of all his movies by date, release date, foreign distribution date, etc., etc., then you'll enjoy this. I would have rather spent my time reading a calendar."
3,"Informative, but boring","I love history, and I live in Hawaii. So I felt I ought to better know my Hawaiian history. I do now, thanks to this book. However, it is not an exciting read as I had hoped!"
4,Great with headphones not so great with two speakers,This sound card sounds fantastic with the headphones on. During the demo that comes with the card you literally get the feeling that the helicopter is flying over your head and that there are bees swarming around you.Unfortunately with normaly two speaker headphones it wasn't as good. I never really felt that there was anything behind me and even with the four speaker support it wasn't that great.Headphones are the way to go!!!
3,"Good sound, but outdated drivers= problems with DirectX 8","I've had this card for a while, and the sound used to be great, but Aureal being out of business meant no further support for drivers (and Diamond's drivers are based on the manufacturer's), and each time I install DirectX 8, the 3D games start crashing after a few minutes of gameplay. The card is very stable in windows 98 and easy to install. I know it is not the video card, I've replaced it a few times.A3D technology is great, I just regret not having the opportunity to keep this card working to its full potential. Even though the last drivers support EAX 2.0, when it is enabled the games crash even faster."
1,Its not good at all!,"the Reason I bought this is because I was going cheap. When I first installed it, it totally blacked out my computer. I am a coputer tech. and I usually dont have these types of problems. Well my computer Died and when I looked around my Mother board I saw that it buned my Ram. Not woth the Money. Buy Sound Blaster Live for a guarantee product."
2,it's a poor quality phone!,"I have a similiar model ""Panasonic 900 Mhz cordless phone with voicemail and caller ID"" and I loved it. Then I saw this model with same capacity plus TWO LINES and cheaper price! So I bought it to replace my one line model and regreted now since my friends often complain that they couldn't hear me clearly. Sometimes I even notice myself the phone was ""jammed"" during conversion and I had to change channel manually! This big ""Digital GigaRange DSS"" label on the phone is like a fraudulous feature to me because its sound quality is worst than the regular 900MHz model.I tried to find a reason ( besides the price is cheaper :-) and here is my guess(no offense to any country): This model is made in Malaysia, while my previous one was made in Japan.Disclaimer: I bought this phone from other online retailer, not Amazon."
3,I can't believe...,"...that a phone with as many features as this one doesn't have a mute button. I work out of my home, am frequently on teleconferences, and I have big dogs. A mute is a must for me so this phone will go back tomorrow. Who would have thought to look for this feature in the store."
2,"Nice Features, Poor Quality",I bought this phone because it had the features I needed and I had previously owned a Panasonic and had good luck. The phone constantly drops calls to the handset and I have to jump to the speakerphone to continue the call. I sent it in for repairs once but the problem persists. I doubt I'll buy another Panasonic.
2,Disappointing,"The features are okay, but it suffers from two main performance problems:--Volume is too low on the caller's side, and there's no way to improve it. They simply have a hard time hearing you.--Range is poor, compared to other 900mhz digitals, and it suffers from dropout, up to a second or two, even when close to the basestation."
1,Do not buy this phone,I have had this phone for 1 1/2 years. I have to replace it. It has always been a disappointment to me. The dial pad on the phone does not work now. Many of the numbers stick when dialing. I can't stand it anymore and am throwing it in the trash. No more Panasonic for me. Don't buy it.
1,Look Elsewhere!,"I researched the purchase of a new phone for quite a while. When I came upon this one, I thought it was the best. I was wrong! There is no caller id display on the base unit. If the handset is away, you will not know who is calling. The sound quality is awful. Nobody that calls us can hear anything! In my stubbornness, I was really thinking that it was their phone that was the problem. It couldn't be the...Panasonic that I had just purchased, right? Wrong! While I was at work, I called my husband and the only thing that told me he was on the line was the lack of ringing. I could not hear a word he said. If you are reading this while looking to buy a cordless phone, know this: The output is awful and look elsewhere!"
1,Tedious Mess,"This work is just that, work.Reading it was not an absorbing experience, the structure of the novel is exposed as if the authors notes were printed in bold highlights and the rest of the text was word processed, cut and paste from some rather dull historical reference works trumped up as diaries. The characters have no depth and behave in unrealistic ways that allow them to be hung easily on the rickity framework of the plot. The protagonist is a pedantic boor who never engages.The author is carefull however to make sure that the color of each of the females characters panties is never left in doubt. The book seems to expouse an enlightened humanist view but its insights are trite, obvious and easy. Gee whiz, humans are a complex mix of good and evil.If you are interested in Boer War read the memoirs of Winston Churchill from which much of this novel was lifted and ignore this labored effort at cleverness."
4,i'm fearful i'm fearful i'm fearful of writing this review,"and this review is fearful of me. I don't know how there can be reviews on here that don't mention the Pixies. They don't sound like the Pixies, per se, but they DO sound like a Pixies cover bands. Really, if someone was listening to this and I walked in and hadn't heard it, and the person told me it was a cover of some rare Pixies song, I would believe it. Everything about this screams Pixies to me. But that's a good thing. You've probably heard To Hell With Good Intentions and Alan Is a Cowboy Killer, and if you have, you'll know that Alan Is a Cowboy Killer is a FANTASTIC song. The rest of the CD is also quite good, although I don't really care for to hell with good intentions. Anyway, if you like Come On Pilgrim or Surfer Rosa, you should like this."
4,Essential Mclusky,"If you can buy only one Mclusky CD, make this the one. It high energy from start to finish. If it's make-your-jaws-tight rock you seek, here it is. It's about as calm and refined as the average nuclear blast, but isn't that what you're looking for? Just get it!"
2,'Tis clunky,"2 1/2Can exhibit a fun, unhinged indie-rock quality, but is overall too infatuated with its own quirky distortion to offer consistent appeal."
2,"I want to like it, but...","All three Buster Bros. games, Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo and Block Block. They're all great games, but unfortunately they're almost impossible to enjoy; the game has serious problems with the PSP's firmware updates. After updating to 3.52, Puzzle Fighter would shut down my PSP at seemingly random intervals, and Buster Bros. refused to start at all; the game would just freeze at the loading screen. Things only got worse when I downloaded 3.71 - attempting to quit out of any of the games just hangs it at the loading screen. I couldn't even quit back to the PSP's menu via the Home key as the system would simply freeze.So while this is a great collection of games, it doesn't make a bit of difference if you can't even play them reliably. I can't recommend this one."
3,Game,Some of the games on here are cool...bubbles!!!! I just wish the Street Fighter games weren't on here though
1,I feel jipped.,I guess I thought the the title: Puzzle World was all I needed when it comes to looking for a good brain game for PSP. I was wrong.. The Cheesy games to choose from are not what I expected when I recieved and opened this one... I know that's all my fault. I'm just writing in to say research before you buy.
1,Blahhhhhh,Game does not have tetris. I read a review that said it did. My fault i should have read into this product more.
5,Easy Handling,I had this forend grip installed on my Mossberg 500A Persuader. It made a big difference in ease of handling and shooting. It improves my balance. Highly recommended.
4,Adam and the ants concert,"This was the only commercially available concert from Adam and the Ants.This time capsule captures Adam and the Ants at their peak. Sadly it is only on VHS and such a shame too.The only reason I give it 4 out of 5 is that they do not perform ""Stand and Deliver"", which is too bad.Definitely worth getting if it's available any time soon."
4,I'm a Turk and liked it for its neutrality.,"I am only suprised about how people can call themselves modern and can call Turks as ""animals"".In every book except this one the idea on the above was sentenced the main idea but because it was a real, neutralist research (this book) I can only ask you to read and see if ottomans were animals with two feet -as you think- or human beings who managed to live for 7 centuries in three lands."
1,Useless,"This book may have some use for some history anorak, but if you are looking for a book that guides you through fourteen walks in Athens then look elsewhere. There are few, microscopic, maps, and most of the rambling prose that goes on for pages on end is not relevant to the walk itself, but historical digressions and anectodes. The author didn't think it useful to put summary sections at the beginning of each walk specifying how to get there by public transport, how long the walk is, how long it takes, difficulty, accessibility, nothing. The book has no structure to speak of except for the chapters, so do not think for a minute to skim-read it *as* you are taking the walk, unless your goal is to read a book and not walking."
5,Rocking Ricochet,"Ricochet may be a short and edited version of TD's many live concerts but still it was so excellently crafted that gives you an impression ""how did they do it"". I had this album on vinyl and the sound was already crispier when the remastered version came out even better. Td is trully ahead of their time and this early live concert is a living testament to that. Richocet stands out as one of TDs best live release. Though with the TD tree this live album may be obsolete but at its release it was a phenomenal achievement."
2,A Disappointment,"This is a cut and paste job of live concerts and overdubbed studio material that just doesn't make sense. This is the weak point in the Phaedra, Rubycon and Stratosfear line up. Since one of the concerts Ricochet was taken from was the Croydon concert buy the official Tangerine Bootleg Box Set instead. You can hear the Croydon concert in its entirety as well as many others. Ricochet is just a plain bummer and the irritating vocal effects that were no way a part of any of their concerts have got to go. If you've got the money spend it on the box set instead."
5,Excellent mochi maker,"The Panasonic SD-MA18N-W Mochi Maker proved to be a very good device, providing excellent results in a relatively short time. the unit steamed 3 lbs of sweet rice in about 25 minutes and pounded the rice for about 15 minutes to produce a nice, smooth ball of hot mochi. The Amazon price was good and included at the time, an additional $25 discount and free shipping - hard to beat!... The mochi came out of the machine quite easily and cleanup was very easy. The first few batches of mochi were quite consistent and easy to work with (soak time for all of these was > 10 hours (overnight)); the final batch which was soaked just 5-6 hours came out very sticky and difficult to work. Overall, an excellent product."
2,Poor quality reel,"The rod seems ample enough. However the reel would not release the line. We took it to Dick's ( they also sell this combo) and asked if they could repair it. The repairman said that he would not work on it because the quality was so poor. He took a new combo off of his rack, and after a tug or two on the line, it seized in the same manner."
5,im shocked noone else has responded to this book,"i could say a million wanky things about this book...but that would be unfair to its integrity, and wouldnt do justice to how it effects you when you read it.it has a fatalistic poignancy and originality that makes your brain develop a different pace of thinking, where everything and nothing is of importance. someone else called it a little too sad, but i think its strength lies in its ability to be both painful and enlightening (alright alright so i went wanky anyway but i couldnt help it!).truly memorable, and i kid you not, ive read it six times!"
1,Save your money,Any good piper who knows what they're talking about will tell you to stay away from rosewood bagpipes. They are a cheap imitation made from inferior wood and usually the bag and reeds are all bad too. Save your money for a real set of pipes (African Blackwood).
2,"sorry Infinity, this one does not sound good.","I have owned a pair of Infinity Beta 20 for 4 years, and I am not a happy owner, not at all.First, the good ones - their high frequency reproduction is pretty good, and they do have little resonance.Now, the ugly, they have very poor mid-range, it is muddy and unclear, at any volume level. This is especially apparent for low pitched vocals. Just how bad does it sound? Well, my $15 Altec Lansing desktop speaker sounds clearer, and I paid $400 for them.Because of this experience, I have lost confidence in Infinity speakers. The C.M.M.D. is more of a marketing scheme, than real benefit."
5,"""Carousel Music"" dramatic, insightful and instructive...","As a psychiatrist, I found Dr. Moskovitz's novel, ""Carousel Music"" both entertaining and believable. His treatment of the controversial repressed memories and confidentiality issues is sensitive and insightful. They are addressed in the context of a mystery story complete with a surprising twist at the end. The development of the intricate characters and their interactions is very realistic, and I found the most interesting dialogue occurring during the courtroom scenes.The reader is challenged to predict the outcome not only of the trial, but also of the novel itself. This is a well-researched page-turner, which clearly shows the complex thought processes of a psychiatric patient, her relatives, the treating physician, and the attorneys who become involved. I look forward to Dr. Moskovitz's next book.Fred Miley, M. D.Immediate Past President, Florida Psychiatric Society"
5,"Intelligent, Intriguing, Insightful","The author's easy writing style takes the reader through the trauma and drama of the abuse, the courtroom, and the anguish of mental illness. I read this novel from cover to cover in just one night which is no small feat considering my busy lifestyle, but I just had to know how it all turned out.Richard Moskovitz develops his characters well and brings them to life with compassion, intelligence and skill. Having worked closely with victims of abuse I can say that this novel is right on the mark. Therapists and suvivors should read Carousel Music."
5,best of Duane Eddy .,"i like this cd very much,duane eddy has re-recorded the numbers he is famous for on this cd,and they sound fresh and modern! If you are a duane eddy fan,it will not disappoint,wonderful sound,wonderful musicianship! as always !!"
2,WARNING! This is NOT the Duane Eddy I wanted to hear!,"Well, if you really want to hear tepid, overly produced remakes of Duane Eddy's classic songs featuring (yech!) syrup laden new-agey synthesizers, then this is the CD for you. Otherwise, stick to the original recordings. Caveat Emptor!"
1,Deceptive marketing indeed!,"I have no grief with Duane Eddy wanting to remake old material; he could have many valid reasons for doing so. But Curb's presentation of this as D.E.'s ""greatest hits"" with absolutely NO MENTION on the packaging that these are not the originals is out and out [fake]. Buyers on Amazon will undoubtedly see through this ruse, but not casual buyers in a store. This strikes me as a deliberate and criminal attempt to defraud consumers.The disc says ""unauthorized duplication is a violation of the law"". That's a bit ironic."
1,"Fraudulent Marketing, lackluster re-recordings.","LET THE BUYER BEWARE! Despite the packaging, these are tepid 1996 re-recordings of Eddy's hits. The casual buyer looking for a good, single CD ""best of"" of the original recordings should keep on looking."
2,shame they are not the originals,"just listened to the audio samples of this album unfortunatly they are not the original recordings,but cheezy ripoffs.Ill be keeping my vinyl ,as they are at least the old duane i can remember.........buyer beware"
2,Dissapointed,I had been looking for a Duane Eddy CD for some time. Some had reviewed this as a poor remake of the original music I remember.But since Duane Eddy is listed as one of the producers I thought it would be good. I should have listened. It was definitely NOT the original music. Some songs are similar but that's all. I am giving it away.
5,"Awesome in the 80s, Awesome in the Twenty-Teens","Hey, it's from the 80s. I think it works. My son 9 year old son also thought it was fun."
5,Crocodile Dundee,This is a fun and family friendly adventure movie. The Australian outback was interesting. One of the few movies I will see more than once.
3,Good day Mate,A simple but very funny movie. One of the top grossing movies of all time. This should be added to your movie collection.
4,Dundee in the City,"This is the final of the Hogan trilogy and is just as funny and silly as the previous ones. enjoyable to watch Paul Hogan do his ""thing""."
3,"(Really two-and-a-half stars out of four) An enjoyable Paul Hogan film - in Australia, then the N.Y. last two-third drags it out","This could have been better - after Hogan/Dundee leaves Aus. The New York morons area bore! Ending sucks too. But the best wasyet to come (Pls. see my Crocodile DundeeII and Crocodile Dundee ""III"" reviews)..."
5,~A blast from the Past~,"I remember watching this movie when it can out in 1986 & loving it! I was so happy when it was released on DVD in 2001. It is such a funny, adventurous & feel good movie. Paul Hogan is so FUNNY & his character is so endearing! You will laugh at his innocence as he leaves the Outback to explore the Big Apple! I L-o-v-e this movie as well as the next 2 installments of Dundee."
2,Very slow,"Crocodile Dundee did not thrill me in any way. I expected belly laughs coming into this movie, and I definitely got none of that. The film started off incredibly slow. I did not laugh at all I think for the first hour. But, when they got to New York, it got better. Paul Hogan is a great actor and was perfect for this role. But, I think the script is what tanked the movie. I don't understand what the big deal is about Crocodile Dundee. I just felt that the ""jokes"" were the same ole thing. They could have expanded the scenes where Hogan is learning stuff about the real world. Those are the only parts that kept this movie afloat. Overall, Crocodile Dundee is a much over-rated movie that disappointed me greatly. 2 Stars"
5,G'day from down under ;),"A fantastic movie that really brought America and Australia closer. I happened to be able to see it in Perth, Australia the year it came out and it was amazing. I really enjoyed the story line and characters.Great movie."
5,Crocodile Dundee,"If you watch the American version, you will notice they have deleted two scene's from the show which were shown in the Australian version. Not a big deal just a suprise to see them missing. Never the less still a entertaining watch, and a must for the collection."
4,A Very Good Movie!,Crocodile Dundee is a very good movie! There are many funny scenes and lines in this movie but I think one of my favorites was when Nick Dundee got even with the drunken hunters. I had this on video but gave it away because it was just pan and scan and I will replace it with a widescreen DVD. I don't like how pan and scan is edited from the theatrical version.

2,...a little shaky,"This stand looks nice and folds nice, but its cheaply constructed with plastic parts...it's unstable and flimsy. This would be OK for an inexpensive beginner's instrument, but don't risk a real axe on this."
4,Does the job...,"Small, lightweight, inexpensive, sturdy.It does what it's designed to do. Keep it away from the mosh-pit and you won't have any problems. I use it at home and I'm quite satisfied with it.Edit 2/14/12Regarding the review about dumping the bass, I just don't see how that could happen if the stand was/is properly positioned (legs fully splayed) and the bass properly seated. Pushing down on my guitar with far greater force than the weight of a bass, in varying directions, I'm unable to get the stand to tip. Only when the hind leg isn't fully extended does it even become possible and that's only if I purposely lean the guitar forward (more vertical).Just an observation."
4,Great Info,"I do lots of research on American Indians and found that the information contained in this Ebook was very helpful,"
2,Not worth it,"AMSCO have done such a terrible job trancscribing these AC/DC songs. Too many of these songs are tabbed incorectly, and sloppy. Avoic buying these books by AMSCO. They havent gotten more then 50% of the tabs correct in this! dont pay more then $5 for this book."
2,Ballroom Fire,"Some good ones, but too many of them seem a little contrived, such as the Paso Doble version of My Heart Will Go On. Interestin addition to your collection if you DJ for your local ballroom club."
1,more fiction than fact,"This book was written by someone who was there. He was in my platoon. But he is too loose with the truth. He likes to exaggerate. He relates his being wounded the second time. Mentions an enemy throwing a hand grenade. It was a friendly booby trap tripped by a scout dog who was killed after catching most of the blast. I was there to see it all. Very disappointing, but shows how fragile some folks self image is. We are proud of our service with C/1/503rd Inf. and regret Hendricks effort to distort some of what happened."
1,Not Believable,"Any self admitted Conscientious objector would still know better than to write the Bull that is in this book if this guy did serve with the Herd, then he would have done the patch with the airborne tab above it. Quite frankly it does read like a bad B-movie script . The guys I know from the Herd don't believe and all of us having been in the same operational areas seem to see this for what it is Science fiction from a phony!!!"
1,Head-Hunter ZERO,"This book is a classic example of no research, just hear-say. It took me 10 minutes on the web to check some of the facts and realize the author had no idea what he was talking about. An example is the Cover, the 173rd Airborne patch is missing the Airborne tab."
1,compares to junk mail,only book in my life i have ever thrown in the trash....all the other reviews are from atlanta...strange...i was in the 173d ...i found many things in the book that were wrong......waste of paper
4,Holger Czukay & David Sylvian - 'Plight And Premonition' (Virgin),"A quite interesting late '80's collaboration between Can bassist Holger Czukay and Japan vocalist, guitarist and frontman David Sylvian. Only description I could think of for 'Plight And Premonition' is maybe part art-rock and part experimental. Just two, yet lengthy tracks here. ""Plight(The Spiraling Of Water Ghosts)"" {18:31} and ""Premonition(Giant Empty Iron Vessel)"" {16:21}. Both cuts are well written and thought out pieces of sonic sound landscapes. This CD should appeal to all Can fans (old and new, alike) as well as experimental fantatics. You know? The fan{s} that the more farther-out the music is, the better. Great thing about 'Plight...' is that it doesn't out step it's limit. A good pick."
4,This one grows on you,"Two beautiful sonic landscapes from a productive period in David Sylvian's fascinating career. Music that needs time and space, but rewards repeated listenings, this confirms Sylvian as a major contributor to ambient and electronic music. Listen to this in conjunction with 'Secrets of the Beehive', and 'Flux and Mutability', the latter another compelling ambient project."
5,Great Bag for tools,This bag is sturdy and roomy--great for hauling my tools around for do it yourself projects! The bag came quickly and is a Great Value!Susan
3,"Nice tool bag, but it's definitely not 'red and black'","As a tool bag it's fine - heavy duty and well made. I would have liked the outer compartments to be zippered, but you can't have everything.However, as a ""red and black"" toolbox it fails dismally. The 'red' looks perfectly blue to me and cannot be made to look red in any light.Seriously folks, I realize it's just a tool bag and the colour doesn't matter much, but I'm using it for a disaster kit and I wanted it to be more visible. I'll keep it - after all, the colour doesn't matter all that much, but at least remove the ""red and black"" from the item description if you can't be sure it's going to be red and black!"
3,Fun for a horsey child (or adult!),"This game doesn't take up alot of room on your computer, but be warned, there are ALOT of glitches in this game which mean that you need to save frequently as you often have to reload a game seceral times to get past particular stages. A detailed walk-through for this game is available on the internet if you are having trouble with it. The horses are reasonably realistic, but parts of this game are very slow. There is not much room for unlimited gameplay after the game is over, meaning after you finish it you may never go near it again. Either way, a good horsey romp that kept me entertained for a good four days."
4,:),i love this game. i got the game because i love the tv show and movies :) this game does not dissapoint.
5,"Fun game, challenging","This is a fun game with great graphics. You ""ride"" your horse across the island to different places to solve mysteries. I've never played a game with graphics like this. You really feel like you are galloping across fields at times.I thought it was very hard to get used to at first and it was sometimes very frustrating. I got it because I loved the Saddle Club TV show. It was hard to get used to, and I probably would recommend it for someone around 9 or 10 years old or older.If you are looking for something really different to play, this is a very interesting horse game. I play others more often (Horse Farm and Champion Dream's Time to Ride for example) but this one is truly and adventure.One hint: Save the written map that comes with the game. It's hard to read, but you may need it to get around to the different parts of the island as you solve the mystery."
2,Maxim for Motorcycles,"This magazine is published by the same people that brought us Maxim. So if you like Maxim, check it out. If you don't: pass. The pictures are slick, models are attractive, but there is little in the way of information on how to do it yourself or what was actually done to the bike. It is basically a picture book. If you are looking for technical articles, how tos or performance installs; check out Road Bike for metrics or Hot Bike or American Iron for Harleys and Victory's."
3,Delivery Time is Slow,"I've purchased this magazine off the shelf before, and I'm happy with it, but it's been over a month since I made the purchase, and I still don't have the first issue."
1,HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE!!!?????,Come on! How long does it take to actually get this magazine in the mail!! Ordered this forever ago and STILL HAVE NOT RECIEVED IT!!!Really upsetting to wait and wait!
1,Bad service- mal servicio,"Estoy muy decepcionado de esta compra, solo me la cobraron y nunca se recibió nada en el POBOX, ya hace un año de esta compra y ni siquiera recibí el primer número.He tratado de hacer algunas preguntas al proveedor y solo me dan algín numero para llamar pero ninguna solución."
1,PeeWee Bandits,I would recommend using different dvds to burn your material on this dvd could not be wastch. it would not play in any of my players or on my computer.
1,Terrible waste of money. So very disapointed!,Typically I am one of the easiest to please people. I hardly ever complain about anything but I have to tell you I was more than disapointed with this video.I put it on for my son who watched about 5 min and then asked if he could turn it off it was so bad. The whole video is simply some shakey home made video camera footage of kids riding bikes at a MX Park. The background is music promoting some garage bands you have never heard of and the editing is not that good.For the price I expected something a whole lot better. This is the first product in over 12 years of buying from Amazon that I am very disapointed in. I guess I will be much more careful in the future.
5,The Little Ones Win,A great video filled with little ones with no fear. I'vebeen on a motocross track. Those jumps look like walls. Youcan't tell what's on the other side. I applaud the enormouscourage of these little warriors. I whole heartedly recommendthis video whether you are a motocross fan or not. Put yourselfin their boots. They're just amazing. The footage is awesomeand the music makes me want to join in the fun. Thank you BillCady. Nice job!!
5,PERFECT FOR HEADLIGHT RESTORATION,"I tried other p500 brands of sand papers and each one fell short. You can use them, but be prepared to double, triple, or even quadruple your time to get the job done. Wouldn't use anything else."
2,Slapdash,"This book is subtitled ""Stories and a Reminiscence."" I'll go with the latter, but in all honesty, there is not, technically speaking, a single short story in the entire book. Instead, there are a lot of doodlings and undeveloped ideas for short stories. A couple of these ""stories"" are simplified retellings of Indian mythology (although they are incomprehensible without notes), but most of them are little formless vignettes about the author's childhood and youth. Once in a while there is a poetic image or a minor epiphany, but not one of these ""stories"" has a plot. Although this is a thin book, it was a struggle to finish it. I do not know what Mr. Chaudhuri's novels are like, but after this inept gathering of ""stories,"" I would be loath to read them. He has talent, but mere talent is not enough. Good fiction writing needs craftsmanship and structure. There is very little evidence of either in this book."
2,Bore yourself to death,I have seen bookshops in india selling this book at 80 % discount yet it turned out to be a boring flop.There is one story in this book about a lady who is an aspiring writer - I think it might be autobiographical. Get a life Mr Chaudhari
2,A rash book about a true gentleman.,"I read the book quickly and felt it was also written quickly (especially near the end). I enjoyed learning more about the wonderous Mr. Jimmy Stewart, but was disappointed in the essence of this book. I'm sure I have aided in more wealth for the author, but perhaps by writing about Mr. Stewart he has learned about the core of a true gentleman. The typos were numerous...bad writing and bad editing. But, I did receive tremendous pleasure in reading the remarks by Judy Stewart Harcourt. Her father must be proud."
1,There is only one pleasure in this book,"This book was published just a few months after Jimmy Stewart's death. It seems to have been researched and written in a manner of weeks - so quickly that they didn't even catch all of the typos - and that quick work resulted in a badly written book. Jarring references to popular icons such as Kate Moss, Sylvester Stallone, and Aaron Spelling run throughout the book and detract from the reading experience. Sanello seems to be attempting to draw in a younger audience by using such references, but he merely suceeded in annoying me. Written like a freshman's first English essay, with slightly less attention paid to form, the only reason I would recommend this book is for the brief glimpse, although badly presented, it gives of a great man's life"
1,Why would you buy this? Much better alternatives.,"I would avoid this 'mission control' headsets for a number of reasons, especially since there are a number of alternatives. First, you will soon be annoyed by the microphone 'ball' which dangles unnecessarily in front of your mounth. At this stage in audio technology, the microphone can be near the ear piece and still pick up and filter out appropriate sound. Second, there is no reason to have these in glow colors. If there is any thing that you don't want to 'show off' it is a headset. If you want to spend just a little money, check out the AT&T 90800 headset. It works very well and is dirt cheap. If you want more comfort and really plan to use this device, go with the Plantronics M175 -- I think it is worth the price difference and have used multiple units over the past 3 years."
2,"So cheap I bought five. So flimsy, glad I did.","These things are RED. So if you care about that sort of thing... I have not noticed any of the noise canceling action on these, must be passive noise canceling from the foam piece. First one broke after light use for a couple months. I preemptively applied some tape to that spot on the second one and it broke in the same spot.Sound on these is fine. Ergonomics however suffer. The mic arm isn't flexible. It rests vertically in only one spot. Regardless, a decent headset for the price. I think I paid a couple bucks per unit.I use them about 10 hours/week and they seem to last about three months each. The price has risen considerably since my purchase. Not worth the higher price. $5 including shipping is a reasonable cost for something of this quality. If they get that low again, buy several... you'll need'em."
1,Poor quality in sound and song selection,I was not happy with this CD. Can't say much more than that. Wished I could have sample the songs first.
2,Old favorites.,"Due to the age of the music, reproduction is not brilliant. A reasonable visit into the past."
5,My daughter loves it!,"This is probably my 8 year old daughter's favorite ""toy."" Her dad is an engineer, and thus knows a lot about electronics. He said he was learning about the same things in his freshman year of college; so I hate to call it just a ""toy."" She loves to do this, asks everyday. She is learning a lot of the correct ""jargon"" like parallel vs. series. She is really looking forward to more projects!"
4,"Great little card, nice blue cord...","first of all, this is a 10/100mbs card, which means it will be faster than a 10mbs card if your your network is 100mbs+. Though network cards are fairly boring and undifferentiated products, I like this one- here are 4 reasons why:1.The 'dongle' has THREE indicators lights, thats three times as many as most other dongles. Also, it feels like a sturdy fit, that won't snap off that easily.2.The Blue rj-45 cable is a smooth, out of the ordinary color, that reminds you that you have a stylish netgear card stuck inside.3. The drivers loaded no-probs on my good old dell lattitude 133mhz, which is on windows 2000 now. (my 3 year old Xircom card just broke).4. It matches my Netgear [7 port 10/100mbs] hub, which I have grown to like because it looks good and works well, so I am becoming a loyal Netgear fan.I gave them 4 out of 5 stars because after all, it is still just a network card."
2,Netgear certainly isn't Tough Gear,"Throught the course of 8 months I have gone through FOUR of these because the dongle that connects the CAT-5 cable to the actual card always breaks where it connects to the card. If your laptop is sitting in one place all the time, it will probably be fine, but if you plan on having your laptop move around while you are connected, then forget it. The only reason I stayed with this model was because Staples would replace it for free each time it broke, since it was usually 2 months apart. Other than that, the card itself worked superbly. Fast clean connection when the dongle was intact."
1,Netgear FA-410 Network Card for Notebook PCs,"What a headache, after hours of pulling my hair out, the dongles were bad. I purchaced two of these cards and both dongles were defective right out of the box. It seems this is a common problem with the Netgear PCMCIA cards. Sure they were under warranty but who can afford the down time of constant dongle replacement. Avoid this item and get a 3COM product, they never fail."
5,NetGear Goes A Long Way,"I started using Netgear Network Card for over 9 years now, and recently stopped working. I ordered a new one knowingly this will give me another 9 years of service. Highly recommend this product!"
5,A Pot of Inspiration,"Whether male or female, business person or not, The Gatehouse inspires on multiple levels (philosophically, intellectually, spiritually). The four strong characters are people you'd like to know; they grapple with life's great truths (e.g. paying attention to coincidences that personalize our individual path) through years of friendship, humor and crisis. Business/work ethics, friendship, romance, and a humorous spiritual entity make this book a ""gift"" for anyone on my list."
5,Wonderful book,"This is probably one of the best books I have ever read. Understanding going in that I love this particular time and place in American history for interest and interesting characters, but this a very readable, exciting, intriguing, informative book -- structured in a fascinating manner. Baker shifts seamlessly from voice to voice as he moves around his characters. I read this before Dreamland, actually, and thought it was the better of the two.Buy this book. Read it. Then give it to a friend."
4,LIVES THAT WERE LESS THAN PARADISE,"Bakers diligent research, and writing prowess brings an intricate narrative weaving of truth and imagination that completely immerses the reader in the fight for survival in 19th century New York City.While there are an infinite array of threads to this story, the major character focus is on the three women of the saga, all residents of the waterfront slum called Paradise Alley. Having survived everything from the Irish famine to slavery and prostitution, they find themselves once again struggling through difficult times to protect themselves and their loved ones from the insanity that is running rampant in the city.Any reader with a taste for history, who enjoys a good Dickensian style novel, will be captivated by this story and find themselves flying through the nearly 700 pages of this novel.If you are a lover of historical fiction, this book will definitely not disappoint."
5,Historical fiction at its best,"The details of life in NYC during this time are amazing - one can almost smell the air (thankfully, we can't). After seeing ""Gangs of New York"" I was impressed with how the details from the book and the details in movie held true. Baker has done a marvelous job of creating characters who are from different backgrounds and putting them into circumstances beyond their control. The short chapters told from the different view points is particularly effective. Anyone who loves NYC should read this book."
4,Excellent Read!,"First of all, let me say that I would give this four and one half stars, if that were an option. In my opinion, this novel falls a bit short in historical fiction, not fully enlightening the reader on what New York City was like in the 1860's, and a bit short as to why the Civil War draft protests occurred, and their impact. That said, what this novel does provide, is an excellent plot, with a host of well developed and interesting characters. The writer's style goes from current events, and then throughout the novel, back in time, often character by character, to learn how these characters came to their current situation. The author does an outstanding job of this, which I found rather unique. What I found most entertaining is the various subplots the story delves into - overcoming poverty and adversity, racial and ethnic prejudice, love & sex, crime and violence, and some suspense."
1,top 20 worst novel,It is really difficult to understand how such a poorly constructed book would receive critical acclaim. Improbable events occur on a regular basis...people are casually murdered just so the author does not to explain a box he has written himself into.Do not read this under any circumatances.
5,better than Gangs of New York,"this book is gritty and really sinks you into the era. It has history, most of which you probably had no idea about. Definitely not in most history books. What an insight into the time and facts. Way better than a movie that could have been based on this book!"
1,Ho-hum History,"How to dumb down an exciting period of New York City history into an indigestible overly bloated piece of tripe. Could not find empathy with any of the one-dimensional characters. The author played the race-card ad nauseum-boy, do I hate a non-stop sermon. Tried flipping pages in an attempt to find one portion of the book that would be entertaining-it doesn't exist."
1,Very Disappointing,"I was extremely disappointed by this novel (especially having paid the publisher's price for the hardcover edition). The plot is hackneyed, totally predictable and goes on and on, the author repeating himself. The characters are one-dimensional and unimaginative. The author needs to learn how to write dialogue. AND...what are all those italics about??? Save your money and your time. Read Gotham instead."
4,To many coincidences,"As all of these books this is an incredible love story, but it has to many coincidences, all the time that Kit wanted to do something wrong was Lucien there to help her, and one time she saved his life even when at that time she hated him a lot.About how Kit found her sister, how she contacted her, I can't tell you that it is not true because I have some twin friends and they say that they can communicate with his/her twin sister/brother when one is in trouble, but is really hard to believe."
2,Too much depravity for me,"I like a good romance with heroic characters, but this book had too much depravity for me. I'm not sure why the villains needed to be perverts, but I certainly don't want to read about their disgusting proclivities. The story would have been great without this foray into the world of S&M. There are some things that I would rather not know about let alone read graphic descriptions of!(I also objected to the character that ran an S&M brothel being portrayed in a positive light!)"
2,Didn't like it at all! Is she crazy?,"I can't believe the heroine thought that her plan was actually a sound one. With being discovered during several occasions already, she kept on her games. She sounded reckless and silly with all her activities. In addition, her 'real' proper self didn't seem to be able to pull off all the other more dangerous roles. The cult described in the book was confusing and stupid. I certainly was not expecting to read about this type of dark behavior in a romance novels... The hero was okay and I can't believe he put up with chasing after the lunatic. I also found it hard to believe that she surrendered herself to him through that one dangerous moment of being capture by someone else. I think I may have to give up trying to like Ms. Putney's books. I tried reading several books without much success in latching on the stories..."
3,Too much deceit,"I'm sorry, but I hated the herione in this book. One lie after another. Even I got confused to what was true and what wasn't. Lucien deserved better. This is the first Putney book I did not really enjoy. If it hadn't been for Lucien, it would have been a total waste."
5,best book for a new believer to understand his walk with God,"Because of the statement that""so many people live such a subnormal Christian life, that when they live a normal Christian life, people think they are abnormal"", I was challenged to rethink my Christian experience in light of God's Word. I recommend this book for anyone learning to walk in Christ or for anyone wishing to disciples someone else. A must for a Christian worker's library!"
5,A practical application for living the daily Christian life,I read this book 20 years ago and have been applying the principles in my life ever since. I have tried to walk in the power of the Holy Spirit and not let the circumstances of life put me in a yoyo lifestyle. Dr. Wemp truly hits the practical points that any Christian can apply to help them continue to grow up in Christ Jesus.
5,THE HOLY SPIRIT IN THE LIFE OF A NON-CHARISMATIC CHRISTIAN,"Finally!!! An excellent text on the work of the Holy Spirit in the life of the Believer today. Dr. Wemp quickly inspires interest by challenging the reader's desire for Love, Joy and Peace. Good book for the ""non-charismatic"" Believer who has not received complete teaching on the third person of the Godhead. Written in a simple, conversational style, but powerful and life-changing!!!!!"
2,summer,"I choose this book because I read the book One Fat Summer and it was a good book. Summer Rules is a sequel to One Fat Summer, so I thought it would be good too. However I really didn't like Summer Rules. It was confusing at some parts and I didn't like the word choice. There were a lot ofSwears.It's about a sixteen year old named Bobby Marks. He goes to Happy Valley Day Camp and hasa bratty ten year old kid to watch out for, but he can't be mean or strict because it's the camp owner'sson. Bobby meets a girl that he likes. It is confusing because there are so many characters, it is hard to keep track and it swears too much.If you like the way the book sounds, you can read it. But if you read it you might not like it becauseIt's too confusing or it swears too much."
1,Home Footage,If you want to see footage in the style of a home movie this will fit the bill...good music but not much else.
4,Entertaining,"This video was entertaining. The music was obviously collected from independant bands and I think it fit the atmosphere of the footage. The Stratton and Jackson sections were inspirational, and my family laughed during the bloopers section."
5,A Great Band...From San Diego?(3),"When all their beach crackers and punk puddles dry up, when my weirdo snobs have yawned themselves into genuine exhaustion, there will still be bands, even in our tourist retirement barrio, to give us a glimpse of what the best funeral directors and the Black Heart Procession know:Debilitating sentiment can yet be transformed into expanses of profound tranquility."
3,Not Fantastic,"Upload is 1.3 megabytes. Download is 25. With my old Cat5 cable, I got 15 megabytes upload. Other then that no problems."
2,Good intentions,"My mother-in-law has similar Pfaltzgraff steel burner covers and hers work great. She bought them in the store, so she was able to look them over first. She has turned the eye of the stove on with them still on and has not burned through them yet.We however bought this product through Amazon and they arrived severly damaged and had to send them back. We were refunded all of our money, so it was not a total loss, but I am afraid to order them again. We ordered two small covers and two larger covers. All four were seperately damaged. One had a huge chunk taken out of it. I would buy it in a store if possible to make sure it isn't damaged. Our store closed down so I have not been able to find them, but I'm still looking."
3,Fairly generic overdrive,"I bought this based on the rave reviews of others, honestly it's just an average overdrive. The five separate controls are nice, but I was expecting a more impressive sound than I got, and after purchase I saw it for sale on a local site for half of what I paid. If you need a simple overdrive sound and find one in decent shape for 20 bucks or so, it's alright. Otherwise, save your money and get a better pedal or better yet a decent tube amp."
3,not bad,"I liked the music in the movie, so obviously I like this CD. However, some of the tracks were just sampled a bit in the movie. These tracks tended to be overlong dance club music."
4,"Awesome, simply","Ok, Du Hast is one of the BEST guitar riffs EVER. And the Rage song here has to be one of, if not their best one. And the Deftones rock here, as well as Lunatic Calm, Manson,and the remix of Dragula horrible. Some of the techno here is OK, mostly because it's not meaningless acid techno with some crummy drum beats. Ministry rocks on this album, too. I must say that I love this album as much as the movie itself. It ranks among the best soundtracks out there. I reccommend this album to rockers and techno freex."
5,Awesome,"If you like hard rock, grunge, alternative, anything wwith noise, you'll love this! This is a powerpacked techno album. In one word, awesome! They are in-your-face songs! Bottom line- GET IT"
5,"Incredible Movie, Incredible soundtrack.","First of all, I have two words for you: Track Four. Rob D's Blubbed to death is a killer song, no matter what kind of music you listen to. No lyrics, and mostly percussion, but it has become my all-time fav song. Other really good songs ont he cd are ""Wake up"" by rage against the machine, and ""Rock is dead"" by Marilyn Manson."
5,"Static,harmonic,sultry energy,absolutely brlliant","Rob D, the prodigy,ramstein and all the other's have delivered an adrenaline rush of pure excitement!"
5,Kick-ass movie with a Kick-ass soundtrack,"I strongly recommend that you invest a few bux in the movie and the music of the Matrix. Tunes from Rage Against the Machine, Prodigy, Zombie, and Rammstein make this a must for any techno or metalhead. The music matches the graphics of the greatest sci-fi movie since The Terminator"
3,The Matrix is O.K.,"they could have done better by adding Stabbing Westward or Nails or somebody in are music field I feel we are a little more wierd because we have listened to this album, but it was ok."
3,Eh.. Take it or leave it. It's not awful...,"I wasn't particularly impressed with the album. Any exposure given to the incredibly under-rated and unacknowleged Meat Beat Manifesto is good exposure, of course. But this disk doesn't even include the best piece of music featured in the film: 'Dissolved Girl' from the incredible Massive Attack (this track, which if you've seen the movie is heard through Neo's headphones near the beginning of the show, is available on the album ""Mezzanine"")... and, good god, do we really need to hear that damned Rob Zombie song in yet another place?"
4,The Matrix Soundtrack is a nice mix,"This soundtrack is a good CD to have as background or provide atmosphere. All the songs seem to run together, but that's a good thing. Marilyn Manson and Rage are not really my bag, but in the context of this soundtrack they sound good. Plus, I loved the mood of the movie itself and this soundtrack does recreate that."
5,Great Soundtrack,This is one of the best Soundtacks I have ever heard. Techno & Industrial....You will not be disappointed.
4,"The Matrix Soundtrack, An Excellent Composistion Of Music","This is a wonderful cd to purchuse if you only want to purchuse one this summer. The music is excellent to listen and dance to, hour after hour. It is a rush of exilerating techno beats after one another. With some of the best stuff I've heard from artists such as Rob Zombie with Dragula( A personal favorite), Race Against the Machine, The Deftones, Prodigy, Propellerheads, Rob D, Marilyn Manson, and others. Even for more low key listeners I feel that this cd will grow on you. After all I mainly listen to pop such as Britney Spears and others like her, and I don't think I could go anywhere without ""The Matrix"" soundtrack. Definately one of best buys in awhile!"
5,ITS GREAT!,If you loved the heart pumping non stop action of the movie then you will love the soundtrack! I have to amit i have only heard a couple songs from it but i did buy it. Even just listening to the five sample songs i fell in love with it. It can capture you mind and let you replay the movie in your head over and over again. So go ahead and but the amazing sound track from the amazing movie
3,Pretty Good.,"I have heard Tecno-Metal before, but never really payed close attention to it until one of my buddys let me have this for free, and I am glad I did not speand lots of money on it. Its not bad, but not great either in my opinion. I loved the movie, but I always thought that really good soundtrack should have a few songs you can't find any were elese. If your a big fan of Tecno-Metal you probally own most of this album. Any fan of Re mixs might want to check this CD out. The songs that keepet this for a few spins in my CD player are ""Bad Blood"" by Ministry,(the lyricless) ""Clubbed to Death"" by Rob D., ""Rock is Dead"" by Marilyn Manson, and ""Look to Your Ord for the Warning"" by Monster Magnet."
4,Side-splitting good music,"This soundtrack is full of crazy and insane music. It's got a good blend of whatever kind of music you like, but it's mainly a techno blend. It opened me up to bands like Lunatic Calm and Rage Against The Machine ['Wake Up' actually got me hooked on RATM and now I listen to their music all the time].I definitely recommend this to the devote techno freak or whoever wants to experience this colorful blend. It's also really fun to jack up the volume in your portable CD player in a public place to see the expression on everyone's face as they wonder if you're hearing's gone..."
5,you bet buy it!,"I loved the movie, and the soundtrack is every bit as good. I am sad that they didnt include one song though - the song being played through his headphones as he awakes to find Trinity sending messages to him on his screen. Wish I could find that song. guess I'll have to watch the credits for the song title. Anybody have any idea?"
2,The soundtrack was in stark contrast to the movie.,"As the movie went into it's stimulating twists and turns, the music seemed to be contradictory to the movie content. It's like MTV decided to have a ""Headbangers Ball"", but nobody but the bands came."
5,How it is & how It should be in the future,Great tracks and a good choice of Electronic music all it needed is Massive attack and maybe some appex Twin. a good idea though is to add some good quality new bands to add to this and future Soundtracks
2,Commercialism at its worst,"About half the songs on this album are okay (""Clubbed To Death"", before it suffered the fate in its title from being used in every ad and movie trailer this side of Hell.) The other half are the typical abysmal crap that fill ""soundtracks"" like this. The original score is nothing next to, say, Bernard Hermann (composer for, among many others, ""Psycho"" and ""Taxi Driver"") or John Barry (the Bond theme, but also ""The Ipcress File"", ""Out Of Africa"", and other haunting stuff), in fact it's pretty close to a mindless Strauss ripoff, but it's still better than suffering through the techno/industrial/metal dross that pollutes this CD.Don't buy this album; they're already out there like toadstools, pop compilations that hope to cruise on a movie's success and make the conglomerate even richer. If you really want techno, industrial and rock rolled all into one, try ""Eeviac"" and ""A Spectrum of Infinite Scale"", both by Man Or Astroman? Don't waste your money on something like this."
2,The Matrix: Music from the Motion Picture,"Alright, so the movie was great. If the movie was your inspiration for wanting this CD/tape, then you've been mislead. The music itself is somewhat interesting. Half of the music doesn't have a theme and therefore, sounds better in the movie."
4,"Excellent mix of industrial, techo, and rock","This album has a decent mix of hard rock with interspersed ""calm"" songs to bring the listener some optimism. ""Clubbed to death"" by Rob D is an AWESOME song - written by someone with actual musical talent, but I can't seem to find his albums anywhere. Ministry is a little much for me - I would have liked to see more electronica and less rock. But the album does justice to an already fabulous movie."
1,"Altogether sick, dark, and disturbed.","Altogether a sick and disturbing album. But then, what would you expect from Marilyn Manson, Prodigy, Rob Zombie, and other schmucks without any talent?"
5,~~~~~COOL~~~~~,I LOVE THIS MATRIX CD! IT'S VERY VERY COOL! WHY DON'T YOU LISTEN TO THE MUSIC? ( ^-^ )
2,"Watch the movie, listen to something else","I bought the album because the movie was great. The soundtrack is not great. I don't find the music annoying, just uninteresting."
5,"The movie, ""The Matrix"" rocked and i can't live without it",I just saw the Matrix and it is the best movie I have Ever seen. Keanu Reeves is such a hottie and is the best actor ever!!!!! This sound track practicly describes what the Matrix is; a kick @$$ movie with awesome music. THE MATRIX ALL THE WAY!!!!!!!!!!!
2,"Mostly unrelated, abominable, boring and repetitive","Ever since the soundtrack for ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" I had begun to worry. Why in hell include a song by Annie Lennox with the score? Well, Hollywood decided that the solution was to make an album of mostly unrelated songs.The Matrix is another such case. Only about half the album is bearable, and of those six songs I can remember only three from the movie (plus the credits song by Rage Against The Machine). The pieces by Rob D and Prodigy almost make the album worth buying, but the rest of the dreck really drag it down. Skip this one."
4,A good compilation album.,"The Matrix OST is a worthwile album, and includes not only the music from the movie, but some other pretty cool songs as well, like Rammstein's ""Du Hast."" The Definite high point of this album, though, is ""Wake Up"" by Rage Against the Machine. A must have for any metal or techno fan."
5,Awesome Soundtrack,I feel like I'm stepping out of a telephone booth and getting ready to walk down a busy sidewalk when I listen to it.
1,Phony Postmodernity,"Let me clarify up-front: ""The Matrix"" will become one of the first movies credited with bringing the philosophical construct of post-modernity well packaged to the ignorant masses; the soundtrack will not.The movie is highly post-modern; the music is not. The soundtrack simply does not match the creativity and contextual relativity best manifested in the true underground scene. Why the filmmakers selected (Manson) and his phony noise for the soundtrack music is beyond comprehension.The movie had much better fared with unpretentious, high energy hard trance and trance music from Detroit, Amsterdam, or Paris."
1,"Too much ""Hard Rock"" to be a good CD","If there were more music and less noise (like Manson), this could have been a winner. I was very disappointed, and want to return it except for one or two songs on the CD that are expressive and not just loud."
3,The Matrix music score why it rocks,"Ever since i saw the Matrix i loved the hard-rock music score! I instantely went to go get it and listen to it. The song that made me want to get it was DuHast by Rammstein. The song fits in great with the movie. There were also alot of other great songs on it like Rock Is Dead, even though Rock Is Dead is more on the heavy Metal side of music it is still fine with me (don't go thinking I like Merlyn Manson because I don't I think he's or should I say ""it's"" a sycho,oh ya) To make a long story short The Matrix is a great soindtrack and I think you should take a look at it. Besides some nasty language and a few flaws it's great! 1"
1,This soundtrack is awesome; oh wait it isn't,"Hey, I've got an idea; instead of producing an album with originality and new music, let's just take a bunch of washed out musicians, and throw songs from their albums (which have all ready made them plenty of money) and not think up anything new. Better yet, so people won't catch on to our deceiving ploy, we'll even remix a couple songs to make them even crappier and less original."
3,Not impressive!,"This CD soundtrack is not as good as the movie! I liked only few songs. u will need ear plugs if u wanna listen to these songs! Yeah, it has lots of techno-metal songs, but in my opinion, few of them are good. Those which will energize u are:1. Clubbed to Death.2. Dragula.3. Leave you far behind.4. Prime Audio Soup.5. Spybreak: very appropriate for the lobby scene & kinda makes u feel the moment.6. Mindfields.(The Matrix: Original Motion Picture Score soundtrack) is much better than this CD. The soundtracks of the Matrix Reloaded & Revolutions are way much better too."
3,This isn't what I had hoped for,"The Matrix was an AWESOME movie, which I have seen three times (I love the kung-fu fx). The soundtrack, however, was not quite what I expected. It is too ""angry"" sounding for my tastes- I was hoping that the music inspired by a cyber-fx film such as the Matrix would be something entirely different. I did, however, enjoy ""Spybreak,"" ""Clubbed to Death,"" ""Wake Up,"" and MAYBE Marilyn's song. The rest is just a bunch of grunge guitar. If that's your thing, buy this CD. If not, stay away from it."
4,Good,"There is good stuff on here. I actually love the instrumentals best of all. And, incidentally, I was listening the a classical station the other day, and the melody that goes in and out of ""Clubbed to Death"" came on! It was some old classical song, like Mozart or something. I wish I caught the composer. Anyway, the credit for this melody isn't given on the CD liner. So, anyway, you are listening to a classcial music riff when listening to that song."
4,"Excellent soundtrack to a dark, sinister movie","Lately I have been getting into soundtracks and I have heard my share of cool ones and ones that should have left well enough alone. This one stands out as one of the better ones. A decent mix of music and like others who have reviewed it, I am enchanted with track 4. This soundtrack captures the dark sinister mood of the movie which is a must see."
1,not much,"this soundtrack isnt that great, just the shallow sell outs you'd expect on an album like this, i give it a one because it beats yanni"
1,GOOD MOVIE BAD MUSIC GENRE,THE MOVIE WAS THE ONE OF THE BEST I'VE SEEN BUT I REALLY DISLIKE THE SOUNDTRACK. IF IT WAS TECHNO I'D LIKE IT OTHERWISE...
3,The Matrix Soundtack,"An ok mix, with a couple of good songs. TRUST ME, this is an album that you can live without in your collection."
4,Sorry about the confusion,yipeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!! this was good. I espesially liked that one song by Rammstein. I also liked that one by Rage. the others are crap exept Club to death which has kind of a morbid title but it rocks your socks. oooooooooooooooooooo mayralin manson is a he/she. when i was listning to Club to death I tried to do t. the matrix sound track was good. i thought the matrix soundtrak was totally rad. just kidding. but not really.
1,Why do these songs have the wrong artist names?,"Why do I keep finding that most of the theme songs are written by different artists on other albums?Clubbed For Death was done by Crystal Method, and I know that for sure because it's on their album."
5,Every Child Should Be Introduced To Curious George!,"One of the best childrens picture books ever. Written to inspire imagination, and accompanied with amazing water-color paintings. Kids keep going back to their Curious George books, to find details they missed, and ideas for how they could make an impact on the world. There is a series of Curious George books, but each is a stand-alone book. It's also nice to have children's books that aren't just empty stories used to push a toy line. The original 7 Curious George books seem to be more popular with most kids, so start with those (Curious George, Curious George Takes a Job, Curious George Rides a Bike, Curious George Gets A Medal, Curious George Flies a Kite, Curious George Learns the Alphabet, Curious George Goes to the Hospital). If only more childrens books were written with this much love and detail."
5,Instant Classic.,"This whole CD is brutal. Never a dull moment. Multi genres violated on this disc. Metal bands and Christians should runaway in fear.But when I here the song, ""scientific remote viewing"", I'm ready to fight. That song is so powerful. I love it. I have no idea what is being said, but i don't care. It's on now Christians, bring it! Knock on my door now! ARRRRRRRRRRRR!Cannibal Corpse ain't got poop on this.Good luck finding something better. Really, good luck!ARRRRRRRRRRRRR!"
2,Comepletely misleading,"There seems to be a big problem here!I just purchased this cd from my local cd store noting the sticker on the cover that said ""for fans of Mr. Bungle..."". If you're looking for inventive forays into every musical genre, look elsewhere.I was outraged to find the cd to be entirely grindcore, not a single deviation from the metal realm. I will admit though, they are quite clever for a typically base gerne, but with just one straight up form of expression I quickly become bored. I should have noticed the Relapse logo on the back.Having followed Relapse previously with bands like Neurosis and Halo, I know this record company will say just about anything to sell their little cds. And I fell for it. Remember, kiddies, don't buy cd's based on how good the sellers tell you it is. Do your research."
1,movie is very bad,"DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE,the whole movie was not enjoyable and no action at all.i threw my copy away."
2,?,"This is one of the worst martial arts movies I've ever seen. The dubbing is horrible, there's no way you can tell what they are saying. Jet Li's not even in the movie even though you see him on the cover. The very first fight in the beginning was really good but then the story completely collapsed. I suggest you get SHAOLIN TEMPLE, the first Jet Li movie."
3,Very short brim,"It's comfortable, but I prefer the traditional style with the longer brim for better glare protection. The design of the earpieces on both models - I have the short brim in black and the long brim in tan - is far superior to the ""old style"" visors - very light and easy to wear for long periods of time."
1,There's a bump at the front that hurt my forehead,"It's un comfortable and hurt my forehead. It's stiff and unpleasant to wear. I would not buy it again. In fact, i had to buy another visor to repplace it."
3,Too big for my head,"Sadly, this visor was too big for my head and it kept sliding down and landing on top of my sunglasses, which didn't work for me. It looked great though and was well made, but I did have to return it."
1,Falling apart + headaches,Bought a new one. It arrived falling apart at the seams and definitely causes headaches. Hurts to wear for more than 5 minutes.
4,Great visor's,These are the only visors that work on the golf course. You have no headache after a round of golf. Look great too
4,Cute entertaining movie,"I like light-hearted entertaining classic movies, and this movie was enjoyable. I needed something light in the background while I exercised or cooked in the kitchen. I thought the actors and actress were charming and the story was nice."
2,not good,"Cheap price, funky color. The problem is the constant back-feed buzzing sound. It is distracting for the person on the other end. Otherwise, it has so far, worked well which is why I gave it 2 stars but the buzzing shows there is a quality issue. I would invest in a better brand - you get what you pay for!"
1,Didn't play properly after syncing,"After all the software and updates were installed, I was able to ""transfer"" songs from my computer to my mp3 player. Unfortunately, when I pressed play on songs, it wouldn't play (even though the artist and song title was completely visible on mp3 player). No tech support seemed to fix this problem. The mp3 player has collected dust since I bought it."
4,good first effort,"Brent Arnold has done arranging work for/with bands like Quasi and Modest Mouse, and he applies those talents to his own debut album, which sounds so much like Thalia Zedek's post-Come work that you can almost hear her singing behind Arnold. Most of ""Last Boat"" is solidly orchestrated pop and is solid next to any of the recordings Arnold contributed to behind the scenes.Recommended if you like Quasi or Modest Mouse or any other band Arnold has worked with."
2,Tie Clasp,Tends to slide on the tie a little. Tie clasp came apart after removing it from tie the first time. Is it worth returning? Will attempt to fix it ourselves. Disappointed. Cheap.
2,"great illustration, definitely misleading","lovely illustrations, and good childrens book & ideas, but the basis of the story is an ""urban legend""."
5,Setting the Record Straight,"Yes, it was illegal to be a Catholic, ordered by King Henry VIII following the imprisonment of Queen Anne. It has been illegal to be Catholic/Christian in more than one country at more than one time. There have been many symbols over the years to practice Christianity in secret as there are today in the Middle East. What a terrific education for today's Christians and/or Catholics to not take Christianity for granted.This book is a wonderful lesson in religious tolerance."
5,Excellent history of the ingenuity of persecuted Christians,"This is a truly amazing book, both in terms of content and illustrations. It was fascinating to discover the REAL meanings of the different verses in this Christmas song and the artwork is magnificent. Our Sunday School team thought the history of this song was so important, they created a Christmas program for our children to offer to the congregation based on this book."
3,Not what I thought,"I bought ""Rhythm of the Prideland"" after I had bought the Broadway soundtrack for the ""Lion King."" I had thought that since ""Rhythm"" was by the same composer, Lebo M, it would have more of the tribal, percussive sounds that the Broadway music had. I didn't take into account, however, that this cd was released before the Broadway version and thus is not what I had expeceted. It's got some fun songs to it, but for the most part I wasn't as happy as I could've been."
5,oohh noo!!!!,"its such a shame...I've heard so much about this CD and I really like to own it, but yesterday I recieved a message from Amazon.com, who said that i was not available... is there anyoine here who can help me? it's very important that i get this CD new. if you can help me, then contact me at my E-mail which is: laursen_mini@hotmail.comThank youJacob"
3,Lumbar pillow for chair.,It is fine. I guess not too short nor too long describes it. It is a little hard.
3,Smaller than expected!,This product did not list dimensions.. If it had I would not have purchased it. It is rather small for a lumbar pillow. The one I was replacing was quite a bit larger. Otherwise it is fine.
1,Miss the old D Shaped Back Roll,"I had purchased one of these before from the same manufacturer but lost it. I loved the old one, but this new one I ordered is MUCH smaller, width wise and lengthwise. Am very disappointed, especially for the price. Seems like I could have picked it up at the $1 store."
5,great product,I have lower back issues and this helps my posture when sitting. I have less fatigue at the end of the day.
3,TOO FIRM,"THIS ITEM IS EXTREMELY FIRM (ALMOST TO THE POINT OF BEING HARD). iT DOES NOT CONFORM TO MY NECK AS WELL AS MOST OF MY OTHER ""MEMORY FOAM"" PRODUCTS DO. i WOULD SUGGEST LOOKING AT OTHER MEMORY FORM PRODUCTS BEFORE PURCHASING THIS ONE."
4,"Not great ,just very good.",I found this movie fun to watch and thought Val Kilmer did a nice job. THis isn't as bad as you may have heard and not as great as some reviews would have you believe. This is one to catch if you can but don't spend all day looking for it!
4,excellent,"I think this movie is one of those movies that is always overlooked. It is a wonderful movie. Everytime you watch it you will ""discover"" something new."
4,Miracle four,"I agree with the reviewer who distrusts critical mumbo-jumbo and found this not very ambitious movie entertaining and appealing. To be sure, many things could have been done better (Dr. Russell's initial exposition on cold fusion, plausibility of the overall plot and eventual results, the way the Saint was haunted by his past etc.), but I think the acting was really good. Additionally, there wasn't too much blood spill and unnecessary sex which I think rendered the film even more balanced. Sometimes expensive and even sophisticated movies leave you empty after you've watched them; this is a rather naive movie that might give you something."
4,The Saint DVD Amazon Verified Purchase,"The Saint is an excellent movie. Val Kilmer's acting skill is showcased as he adopts many different disguises and personas throughout the film. Although the beginning is a bit slow, there is plenty of action and suspense to make for an enjoyable story."
5,Fantastic Movie!,This has always been one of my favorite Val Kilmer movies. Just the right mix of action and romance.
3,Short of a Saint. More like a monk.,The movie is not as good as I thought it was going to be. My son liked it though.
3,a good val kilmer flick...,"i know, sounds like an oxy moron but even if you don't like val kilmer you'll like this flick. it's a slippery theif action movie with a semi decent love plot in it, it's got a great plot and the carefree humor of the main character is pretty good. might not be worth owning for everybody but i liked it enough to own."
3,I'm named after Saint...,"Val Kilmer stars in this relatively light film about a thief-for-hire whose so close to reaching his target goal. But the end is never easy and Kilmer's character (the thief) finds out there may be more then just money at stake.This film is pretty enjoyable, and has a nice basis that it goes from. For instance, Kilmer's character does not just change his name because he has too, but because of the anonyminity with which he has lived his whole life. Thus we are intrigued, and as his character humorously goes from disguise to disguise to escape ""them"" all, we just cannot help but get a little caught up.As one reviewer mentioned, Kilmer fans should enjoy his different ""selves"", or saints of the moment if you will. Yet, this film is actually just good-natured, and a bit dramatic (action) at times too. So the fan cannot helped be pulled in a bit, at least to see, well, what is his name?"
4,This movie has it all.,"Anyone who is into spy movies, action movies, love stories, or electronic music will go crazy for this movie. The spy and action portion is enough to keep you on the edge of your couch. Throw in a beautiful Elizabeth Schue and you have the complete package. For all you who are into the electro music scene, like me, this movie is one big music video. The soundtrack includes some of the best and well known electro groups. This movie would make a great first DVD for anyone starting their collection. Great sound, great music, and best of all, great movie! ENJOY!"
4,Excellent spy flick,"A great spy movie. Great add to the shelf for relatively unknown releases. Easily Kilmer's best. Unpredicatable plot, good casting, and Kilmer's dusguises and language impersonations are second to none. Hey, it's not the Roger Moore Bond level movie, but definitely keeps you from looking at your watch."
1,"Ungodly, to say the least.","To be fair, this film would have been quite nice if it hadn't claimed to be about Charteris' character Simon Templar (alias The Saint). For anyone who's ever read any Saint novels, Noyce's characterization of Mr. Templar leaves a lot to be desired. It's as if James Bond were portrayed as an unshaven hoodlum who drank cheap beer and didn't iron his Sea Island cotton shirts.The techno-gadgetry was nice, but the Saint would have eschewed such gauchery and walked in the front door and said ""Give me the chip, Algernon.""The best part is the car horn, playing the motif from the old Saint TV series."
2,Kilmer's No Roger Moore,"After seeing The Saint on television with Roger Moore, I became extremely addicted to the show and loved it very much. Practically James Bond without the gadgets. A couple of weeks ago I finally watched The Saint with Val Kilmer. The reason I wasnt too crazy about the movie was the fact that Kilmer's character resembled nothing of the Roger Moore character. Roger Moore was debanoir, suave and knew what he was doing. Kilmer was sometimes not believable and was also in different disguises. The Roger Moore character was never in disguise and to the best of my knowledge, the George Sanders character was not also. However, I give the movie credit for establishing a plot that gets a little outrageous. Fair movie, but watch the Roger Moore show if you like the Simon Templar character."
1,Saint it Aint,"Leslie Charteris, the Saint's creator, never lived to see this completed, which is probably a relief to him as it's not very good. Kilmer is about as English as a Cadillac and the Saint is very English, that's the hole point of him. You wouldn't like an Englishman playing Columbo now would you! Bring back Ian Ogilvy, or Roger Moore, and learn what the Saint is really about>"
3,Chemistry Explosion,"This movie is, indeed, improbable, but the chemistry between Shue and Kilmer is electrifying. Glorious soundtrack -- especially the love theme."
5,Honest review,"This is one of the best movies I enjoy watching time after time. Saw the edited version on TV probably twice and I just had to finally get the DVD. Val Kilmer and Elisabeth Shue definitely have great chemistry and this movie has about a bit of everything from drama to suspense to comedy. It is not to be missed.While most of the reviews for this movie are high 4-5 stars, I can't seem to understand why some critics flat out give it 1-2 stars. What a shame... All I have to say is you can't believe everything you read - even this review :)- you have to watch it to know if you like it."
3,"Val Kilmer, Elisabeth Shue have fusion","Freed from knowledge of this popular character and left to enjoy THE SAINT on it's own merits, I enjoyed this light escapist spy flick back in the 90s. And not having known previous portrayals of the merceny spy I liked Val Kilmer's turn as I happen to like just about anything he does. Plus I liked Elisabeth Shue. The plot is kinda weak, lacking in logic in the tradition of fantasy action films. Sometimes, for one reason or another, that is annoying and sometimes it isn't. It would be nice if the world had an energy source like cold fusion right now which is what Kilmer's thief is after. Buy it? Can't say I would, but if ya dig spy/thief movies or think Val Kilmer is a talented cat it's at least rental worthy."
3,Holy mess!,"Noyce is an extremely good director. He usually likes to dare the viewer with hard and challenging scripts(Henry and June, for instance) but somehow he failed in this case with this misfired character of the main character. The storyboard and the actor direction became the Saint in almost a cartoon network.So, if the true purpose was simply to delight the young audience, the goal was made. But for the mature viewer, this film was a crossroad between the Avengers and 7 Faces of Dr. Lao. Thre was chemistry sexual among Elizabeth Shue and Val Kilmer, but the whole structure of the plot does not resist a further analysis, the script possesses an extreme weakness, fragility and predictability.It's hard to believe Noyce had directed one of the most relevant films in the decade as Patriot Games was, compared with this easily forgettable film that may work out for a boring pop corned rainy weekend."
4,Exciting action-adventure!,"This film was surprisingly entertaining and interesting, it had a nice story with plenty of twists and turns. Val Kilmer makes the perfect action hero as the Saint. He manages to outwit and outsmart the bad guys by adopting a variety of disguises and funny accents. Elisabeth Shue is beautifully stunning in this film, she actually adds some wit and charm into her character. The soundtrack was an absolutely amazing work of art! The Saint has all the elements that sustain the entertainment with plenty of action, suspence and romance. All in all I would recommend this movie for an evening when you have nothing to do and want to watch a movie that you'll definitely enjoy."
3,Good movie; DVD not too great,"If you've seen the movie and love it, well, get the DVD. But: the transfer is pretty weak at certain points, *especially* during the ""revelation at Red Square"" scene near the end. The DVD doesn't seem to have enough data on it to deal with the fast pans through the crowd, so it looks like there is some horizontal resolution missing.Another quibble with the DVD: the director's commentary is the MOST BORING commentary I have ever heard. To be fair, I only listened to the first 13 minutes of it, but it bored me to tears. Noyce drones on and on about the old versions of The Saint, and the old days of Hollywood, and how he came to direct the film (a story he begins in the first 13 minutes but doesn't finish), and so on. Who cares? I want to know what it was like to work with Val Kilmer, how they did a few of the shots, where they found their makeup crew, etc. Just a matter of taste, I guess."
5,Nice,This is an older movie but still good. We have seen it probably 20 or 30 times and still enjoy it.
5,"Brilliant move, a thinking mans james bond","awesome viewing, buy this if you like espionage, a bit of romance and a great story, a cool movie."
5,"Girls, guns, Russians, what more do you want in a movie","Movie reviewers called this movie sensational, so I went to see it, now I am calling it sensational. Val has allways being one of my favourite actors. This movie could have easily being scripted for a bond movie, but in my opinion it is better this way. Excellent plot, girls, guns, Russians what more could you ask for. It wasn't your average action movie. If you love the bond series because of his gadgets then youll love this. It made ""Mission impossible"" look easy."
1,A waste.,"The Saint was a massive disappointment. I mean, I was expecting him to be an out and out hero...you know, save cities and stuff. Turns out he's a thief who in the end turns nice. The plot for this film is therefore awful. I had to watch it twice before I understood all the cold fusion nonsense. The trouble is, the film doesn't know what it wants to be. It works kind of like this: ""I'm gonna be about Simon Templar's past...No, I'll be a love story between Templar and the scientist...No, I'll be a spy film about the Russian Mafia...' and throughout the film, this happens - it changes from one to the other, and ends up as a mess. Val Kilmer is actually quite good as the Saint, and Elisabeth Shue is reasonably good too - but the film simply bored me to death. Had it been more simple, with more characters and a stronger plot, it could have been a classic....but let's face it, Val Kilmer doesn't exactly outshine Roger Moore. On the whole, as I said earlier, a mess."
1,Really Depressing. Virtually Worthless.,"This is the Whiniest song I'v heard in a great while. It sounds awful, and it is so non-uplifting. It also attempts to portray women as purely domestic. my hand can't get to the knob on my radio to change the station fast enough when this song comes on."
4,Use if you only need a refresher,"The reason why I found this book to be extremely helpful is because it is concise and well in clearing up confusions.I was using this only to prepare for my upcoming Calculus class the next week. This book helped tremendously in catching small mistakes that proved to be my advanced algebra issues.I really didn't need to relearn any precalc, just some refreshing. Definitely use this if you have limited time and don't need intense learning, yet something that actually explains in laymen terms what it is you were supposed to have learned last year."
3,Ok for review,The teaching method is very good and easy to read but there is a lot of errors in the book.Although if you just need to refresh your memory and if you read carefully the text you'll be able to discover the few mistakes and eventually even learn from them...
2,Full of mistakes,I am only into Chapter 3 and have found numerous mistakes. Including mistakes in important formulas such as the Quadratic Formula. I do not recommend this book to anyone who already has problems with math!
1,Errata-fest,"Breifly - there are errata in even the 'Basics' section at the beginning of the book, which is the elementary algebra review.The cover of the book boasts, ""Over two million copies sold"". Well, if that's the case, then there has been over $35.9 million dollars wasted by trusting consumers (at $17.95 retail). I invite the lazy editor of this book to check my math."
1,Read this book if you want to do poorly in math,"I was bothered by the review written by Antonios Giannakas. Mr. Giannakas calls himself a mathematician, I am not convinced he ever read the book. If I (an undergrad.) can find numerous mistakes in this math text, a MATHEMATICIAN should be appalled by the amount of incorrect information in this book. It is hard to believe this book was ever published in the first place. STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!-a mathematician"
1,Full of errors,"Although the authors have very clear ways of explaining mathematical processes and procedures, the book contains plenty of errors, some minor, some major.For example, when explaining the relationships between trig expressions (p. 153), it is stated that sin u = 1/cos u; in fact, a sine is the inverse of a cosecant, not a cosine. A simple but important typographical error.On page 131, it is clearly stated that 9pi/4 radians is a coterminal of 7pi/4 radians; they are at righta angles to each other. The authors arrived at this solution using incorrect math, which does not lead me to believe that they are checking their work very well.I have found many more such errors, and I am disappointed with the book. I didn't buy it from Amazon, and I'm taking it back to the store for a refund."
1,far too many errors to be truly useful,"If the purpose of instructional books is to build a foundation of knowledge in a subject, this one fails. The concepts are presented in a relatively straightforward fashion, but there really aren't enough problems to enable the reader to master those concepts. As many other reviewers have noted, the book is riddled with errors, including some arithmetic errors that are so painfully basic that the authors should be embarrassed to have their names attached to the finished product - and those are just the ones I noticed; I'm sure someone who really knows their precalculus could find dozens more. If I wasn't already fairly comfortable with math, the errors in this book would seriously undermine my confidence in my skills; as it is, they just undermine my confidence in the authors' skills."
5,I'm so happy!,My brother is a big Beatles fan and he doesn't have this vinyl. So Ives looking around and I saw this product... The seller was very dead on with his description if the record and I figured he was sugar coating it a bit.. But when I got it and opened it up it was in such good condition I honestly couldn't believe it. The inside slip that hold the record was a little torn on the seams.. But who cares?!? It's like a 30 year old record.. Ad it's the inside slip... No one cares about that.. Everything else was amazing...
1,scraps on dvd not happy,i played the dvd and there are scraps. I am not happy with it. I never got a call back re: this issue
3,Help!,I have loved this movie for ages and was thrilled to get it on DVD. BUT I cannot watch it because it brings up an error message every time I try to load it. BIG dissappointment! Seller was very kind to refund but would prefer a watchable DVD. I miss being able to watch the Beatles in what I consider their best movie.
1,Luck of the Draw,"I have personally owned two of these controllers, and my brother has owned one. Of these three, only one of them is still functioning normally. As for the other two, the turbo is stuck in the on position on one (numerous attempts to remedy this have failed) and the ""A"" button sticks on the other.If this controller does not break on you, it is actually quite nice. The grips are comfortable, and the size is excellent for adults. The trick is finding one that will not break."
2,Wii I DIM?,"Don't waste your money. Bought two for Gamecube games on Wii. Within weeks both controllers exhibited odd behavior, one has your character continuously running to the left, and the other tends to run up. Smacking the controller around a bit seems to help. Finally decided to email manufacturer, but warranty ended, so they referred me to the merchant. Not the merchant's problem."
1,Pain in the A$$,"When figuring out how to get the controller working is the hardest part of the game it is time to get a new controller. Doesn't work, stops working, goes to sleep. Makes playing the game difficult and unnecessarily frustrating.Cannot recommend this controller to anyone."
1,Do not buy this controller!,Do not buy this controller. IT does not work! I would not recommend this to anyone. We ended up having to purchase a controller with a cord/connection to the Wii directly.
2,Disappointed........,"I purchased this to replace a Game Cube wired controller that my son borrows from the neighbors to play Mario Bros. Smash Brawl. He likes this style over the Wii controllers for this particular game. I tried and tried to get it to sync with the Wii and have yet to do so. I am in the process of sending it back to Amazon, they were nice enough to issue me an RMA. I received no help from dreamgear folks until after 3 or 4 harsh emails at which point they said "" just press the sync buttons and when the lights stop flashing you're done"". I explained to them that I had been doing that for several weeks with no luck. Save your money and buy a different brand if you're hooking it to a Wii."
1,Misleading,"I purchased the Wii i.Glow Wireless controller for my husband to use on our Wii. However, the title as Wii wireless controller was misleading. I didn't realize it was only for Game Cube games. I would return it if I still had the packaging."
1,Misleading,"This controller only works with gamecube games. I wish I had known that when I bought it. It is very misleading when it says ""made for wii"". Also, it's a bad product in general. The paint looks and feels horrible, it looks like it would chip off with light use. Also the unit that plugs into the wii is incredibly loud. Wish I hadn't opened these when I got them."
1,Not what it was advertised as.,This is not a classic style controller for your WII games. Merely another way to sell a wireless game cube controller. It is not compatible with WII games. It will work with game cube games on the WII. I'm going to see if I can get my money back. Bad advertising.
3,"First album by Coti is interesting, though less accomplished than some of his later efforts","Coti (real name: Fidel Ernesto Sorokin) had been known in musical circles for some time as the author and producer of many hits for such Latin American artists as Julieta Venegas, Diego Torres and Paulina Rubio. In 2002, he try his hand with a solo album called simply Coti. Though this is his first album (he would make three more), it was the last one I bought. I have heard many of the songs from ""Esta Mañana y otros Cuentos"", his third album, a live recording of his hits, with such guests as Rubio and Venegas. In Coti, the songs are played on a more acoustic manner, and the results are inferior to ""Esta Mañana"" in my opinion, since Coti's voice is not his forte. However, Nada fue un Error as recorded here is a good effort, as performed with Andres Calamaro, in a less commercial version than the hyperknown one with Rubio and Venegas."
3,So *BAD* it's actually rather good !,"If you're a staunch monarchist with a brain, you WILL NOT enjoy this.If you're a staunch monarchist and very dim, you WILL enjoy this !If you like musicals and kitch, really bad lyrics and muzak, you WILL enjoy this !The lyrics are SO bad (Diana : ""Should I throw up now, or later ?"" or the Queen Mum describing Diana's kids as ""... The heir and the spare of the monarchy"").Some good little tunes in the album, and lyrics so appalingly bad they are hilarious, it's worth a punt for a few quid."
1,"This should be listed under ""Comedy""","To say that this bit is bad is an insult to bad bits. It sounds as if the lyricist read a bunch of sympathy cards, smoked some pot, got emotional, then wrote her feelings down on a napkin. She then gave them to an orchestrator with about twenty minutes to arrange the music.Even the Lifetime network would have declined this script. Only buy this as a gag gift for people that you despise. It's awful."
1,Just plain awful...,"This is absolutely terrible. It's good for a few laughs, but beyond that, there is no point. Musically, it is full of cliches and has no merit whatsoever. It is an insult to the royal family and Princess Diana would be sickened if she were around to hear it. However, that said, it is EXTREMELY funny because it is so bad. Gag!"
1,A kitsch classic!,"This either rates 1 star or 5, depending on your sense of taste. It falls into the same region as Precious Moments figurines and Franklin Mint plates -- if you like those, then you may well find this enjoyable. If you don't (and I certainly don't), then your reaction will either be horror or ironic hilarity -- indeed, it's hard for me to imagine the performers being able to sing these numbers without cracking up.Keywords: kitsch, schlock."
4,More Jewels where these came from.,"Sophisticated guitar pop, halfway between the Boo Radleys and the Smiths (with scattered bits of Rock-a-billy, Funk and Flamenco). In barely half a dozen releases, Mikel Erentxun and Diego Vasallo (a.k.a. Duncan Dhu, from the Basque Country) have written and recorded some of the most beautiful pop songs of the last two decades. This Greatest Hits collection barely scratches the surface of their opus and I recommend you not only to play every song on this CD, but to also look for their previous albums. True jewels. All in Spanish."
4,Something like That,"I saw April play live, and thought she flat out had one of the best voices I've ever heard, with material to match. I had to buy the CD to see if this came across on record, and I was not disappointed. The sheer range and quality of her voice comes through beautifully, and the well written songs add to the depth of that experience.If (like me) you're one of the lucky ones who get to hear her live, buy the CD, it'll make the next show even more fun!If you're one of those unfortunate people whose town she hasn't visited, here's your chance to find out what you've been missing."
5,Something Like...beautiful!,"I loved this album, great songs, great singing! I highly recomend it to everyone!"
5,Praise for Whose Song is Sung,"If you like this genre (hard historical early medieval fiction with just a touch of fantasy presented in a way that makes it seem believable) then BUY THIS BOOK. One of the greats. I have read it twice, and that is something that I rarely do."
2,I don't Luv you baby; not that much anyway,"Unfortunately, the only versions out of the 5 or so available on thismaxi cd are the radio edit, and the Dancing Divas version. The cd fallsunder the curse of many remixed cd versions of favorite songs. Tryingto ""pretty up"" on the original version by adding sound effects, andrepetative different drumbeats only causes one to be frustrated asopposed to pleased. Sorry, I don't luv you baby; not that much anyway."
4,Brilliant country discography,"The year was 1972, the scene was Reykjavik, Iceland. Hank Williams Jr., who had vowed to not make a half-hearted attempt to follow in the career of his musically gifted and fabled father, was visiting this North Atlantic island republic to cheer on his mentor Bobby Fischer (nee Fishpincher), who was locking horns with Rooskie chess icon Boris Spassky in a cold war World Chess Championship match. Hank Junior, who was a step away from grandmasterdom in his true love, chess, got drunk in an Icelandic pub the night before a match and started to ad lib an old Viking sea ditty with Thor Magnusson, a local musician. Bobby Fischer walked in, heard Hank's heart-rending sounds, and said, ""son, as brilliant a chess prodigy as you are, it's nigh time you put your board away and pick up your gee-tar."" Hank took Fishpincher's advice and took off with it, running. Now look what he's become! The dang finest country musician ever!"
3,Hank's paw hain't half as good as Junior,"I fust heard ol' Hank Senior after I got outta Korea in 1952. My granmammy and me was jes' comin' outta the outhouse when cousin JimBob, whose my cousin an' my brother all wrapped up in one, came a walkin' buy with some Hank on his transistor boom box. Well granmammy an' me wuz jes' hootenanyin' with joy after hearin' them doleful sounds a Hank. Thirty-five years later, me an' cousin Newt was leavin' our jobs as executive bankers with Pincus Warburg an' stoppin' in sum country bar when we heard ""Alla my Rowdy friends are comin' over for Monday night Football."" Dad-blammit, I thought! This is sho' superior to his daddy's music!"
2,NOT COMPLETE,"The description ""complete"" on box sets gets more ridiculous all the time. Only 45 songs from a guy who had 9 of the top 40 albums on the Billboard country chart at the same time?! Those 90 songs would barely be the beginning of a real Complete Hank Jr. Better off getting the bargain price CD reissues of the original albums than a bogus set like this."
3,Only touches the surface.,"Linedecker's description of the events as they were portrayed in the media is accurate and complete. Trouble is, it appears he simply went to all the old newspaper articles to cull the information he needed. He also managed to go through police reports. But this books is scant on first person interviews. All the quotes in the book appear to have been taken from newspapers. The book follows an easy narrative, one that is logical and continues to move forward. I agree with another reviewer's comment that the narrative at times is homophobic. But that's not surprising from a book originally published in 1980. While this book is lacking in content, it should not be ignored by those who are interested in Gacy. It at least provides a perspective of how the horrific events of the murders were revealed, as well as the typical nonchalance police exhibit when confronted with missing teen reports."
1,one of the worst of the genre,"Having read between 60-100 true crime books, including three onGacy, I feel qualified to critque this. The book simply skims thesurface in a shameful tabloid manner. The two other Gacy books, Buried Dreams & Killer Clown, were far superior in quality and mass. Gacy was a despicable human being, but even he deserved a better biography than this. This book doesn't offer much more than a few good photos. If it's information you are seeking, then I recommend Buried Dreams by Tim Cahill w/ Russ Ewing. Gacy wasn't a very interesting man to begin with, you could see through him like cellophane. He was sadistic, childish, and ignorant. I corresponded with him for a while and I would not only suggest skipping this book, but I would also recommend finding a better subject to read about. Try Randy Kraft, Jeffrey Dahmer, Dennis Nilsen or Gary Gilmore. Now Ian Brady, there's a sick mind worth exploring!"
5,You can't put it down!,I have read many books on Gacy and by far this is the most insightful one out there.
3,Just Okay,The sticker across the equator has already started to come off right out of the box and there are strange indentations on the surface of the globe.
2,Cheap Quality,"I would not pay $33.99 if I knew the quality of this globe. It's very light weight, my son can lift this up with his thumb and index finger by pinching the top of the globe supporting bar. when he trys to spin the globe, the stand will spin together, it's dollor store quality."
5,An up-to-date globe of the world,This globe allows me to easily find countries and appreciate their position on the planet better than any flat map or atlas can. It is on my desk and used frequently as I do my armchair travels.
1,Very disappointed,Bought this globe from Target and there are parts of both the sea and the ground missing where there are just white marks on both hemispheres. I bought it at back-to-school time to save for my daughter's birthday. Now it is out of warranty at Target and globemaster refused to replace it. Needless to say I am very disappointed having spent money on a product that is damaged and my daughter does not have a birthday present.
2,Very poorly made; returning.,"The map is fine, but everything else is made of lightweight plastic. It's very hard to imagine this product lasting very long, because the base isn't heavy enough to hold the globe well. We will return and purchase a slightly more expensive product with a stronger base."
5,Traveler Blobe-Blue Ocean,"i bought this for a 7 year-old very interested in maps, geography, and countries outside of the US. She was not at all disappointed. It was a good quality product, with some 3 dimensional features, vivid colors, clear markings, and was a good price. It was packed well and arrived in perfect condition. I would recommend it for children of that age and perhaps a little older as her parents and I think she will be able to refer to it as she progresses past 2nd grade."
2,Not worth the money.,"This globe is an entry-level globe and it came in good shape. However, the components are plastic. It's too lightweight and topples over easily. To add insult to injury I found this same globe at a mega-office store for $25. It's worth looking locally before spending the money to have this shipped to your doorstep."
2,Very disappointed,"I feel that for the price, this globe is flimsy and looks cheap. DEFINITELY not worth $30. My granddaughter and I tried to find various cities on the globe and the print quality is so poor that we could barely make out the names. Wish I had seen it on a store shelf rather than on-line. I would NOT have purchased it."
2,disappointed,I was so excited about the quick delivery only to be very disappointed by the globe itself. It seems to have big patches of glue or something under the surface leaving big lumps all over.This will be sent back right away. It was for a gift and I would be embarrased to give it.
1,World Globe,"Hi, my name is Dani Roberts and I am 14 years old. I was wanted a world globe but I hated word globes. Can you please send it to somebody else for me please? Thank you."
2,Paper thin,"Within 24 hours I found gum on the globe. Unfortunately, when I removed the gum the paper came off with it. I would like to know how I can get a replacement.Thank you"
3,What you get for the price is...,"What you get for the price is what you expect for the price. This globe is not going to stand up to daily, school use, but if it's for gentle or hands-off conditions, it should hold up for a while. The ""Raised Relief"" is actually a 3 dimensional rendition of relief on 2 dimensions. The globe actually looks like a mosaic of flat cardboard pieces made and cut to cover a sphere.Disappointed? Yes. Surprised? No. I got what I paid for.As for S/H of the product? Fantastic! Shipped right away, and arrived as planned."
5,Traveler Globe,"The globe I purchased for my Granddaughter is just beautiful, the price was right and delivered promptly."
1,Cheap,"Arrived damaged because the globe is made of cardboard. Also, the writing is tiny! Though the price is lower than most globes, in this case, you get what you pay for."
3,Now a satisfied customer,"Even though I was extremely disappointed in the sturdiness of the stand on the globe I ordered, the orb was ok with nice color and relief. Since the globe was a Christmas gift, I ended up buying another globe. After notifying Kaplan Early Learning Company of my disappointment, they responded to me satisfactorily and I would probably order from them again."
1,Very disappointed,"Out of dozens of orders that I have done with Amazon this is the first return that I have made or my first complaint. One of the other reviewers was right ""very flimsy"". As a matter of fact it fell apart as I was unpacking it. The bottom spindel (plastic) broke off. My granddaughter has her heart set on a globe so I'll go to a retailer and buy one so I can see if it is more substantial.I don't have a problem with Amazon, their return policy is great and the shipping time was as promised."
2,You get what you paid for,"This globe serves the simple purpose. This should be worth half the price. This globe is very light, should be handled with care otherwise the stand feels like it will break. One major complaint which is also complaint of few customers is that the equatorial line actually joins the two halves together. Mine DID NOT quite line up. The equator, which is taped on, seem like it will come out eventually. We'll see how long this globe will last."
2,Cheaply made,I bought this globe for my sons. It is framed in plastic and has a plastic base. It looks cheap and tips over when my son tries to spin it. Do not buy if you're looking for good quality.
4,No Sipper,"Mug keeps the contents hot, but there is no hole in the lid so you can keep the lid on while drinking. Its more like a thermous than a coffee mug."
1,Cordless phone batteries are designed to fail,And the replacement batteries are deliberately overpriced. I recommend buying a phone that uses a standard rechargeable battery -- Consumer Reports has identified several Example: VTech ev 2625. A consumer rebellion is called for.
4,Little Book for the Money,"This is a good book for the money. It has good transliteration, and it gives a short definition of the word. You will not find every word in the Bible in this book because of its size, but the book is well worth the money. It is a little tricky trying using the index if you are not familiar with the Hebrew alphabet."
3,Additional vocabulary,This is a well listing of words to compare Hebrew and Arameic languages. I reccomend this book to students on both languages.
4,You probably can already imagine how this will sound...,"Enya does ""Silent Night"" in her trademark way: Very slowly, with vocal layering and extremely simple accompaniment in which a single chord is sustained until the next chord change, then that next chord is sustained, and so on.It's actually a pretty boring version of Silent Night, if you're looking for musicianship. However, it is haunting in its own way, as are most of Enya's songs. She can sure make a simple chord progression, with simple accompaniment, sound more interesting than what one would expect.The other songs on the single are standard Enya fare -- not Christmas songs, as far as I can tell -- and are actually more interesting than ""Silent Night,"" by way of having more varied and lively instrumentation."
2,"Sadly not a credible, scientific view of cryptozoology.","While ""Claws Jaws and Dinosaurs"" is an easily accessible introduction to cryptozoology, it is not very credible from a scientific point of view. It's written almost on a gradeschool level, with poor annotation. Personally, I believe in the Bible, but Kent Hovind loses all scientific credibility with his religiously zealous remarks. He won't win any converts by calling readers to repentence in every chapter, either. A better, more scientific approach to cryptozoology can be found in ""Mystery in Acambaro: Did Dinosaurs Survive Until Recently?"" by David Hatcher Childress. And for those interested in REAL SCIENCE, the most AMAZING book on creationism (and cryptozoology) is ""In the Beginning: Compelling Evidence for Creation and the Flood"" by Walter T. Brown. Both books are available from amazon.com."
2,"nice, but not more","This book gives a small and nice introduction to the complex field of cryptozoology. It is well written and nicely illustrated. Obviously, it brings not new facts about the topic itself. Most things were copied by books of Heuvelmans, Mackal, Spaeth etc.However, the minor things of the book are the pseudo-religious comments about the bible, the belief in God, and our sins and damnation in the foreword and at the end of each chapter. The real highlight was the statement of the authors that our world is not older than a few 1000's of years, declining every scientific proof about the true Earth's age. This medieval attitude of the authors ruins the nice rest of the book. What a pity..."
1,Poorly written,"This book is trash written by a person (Dr. Hovind) whom purchased his degree through Patriot University, ""Patriot Bible University (PBU), formerly known as Patriot University, is an unaccredited fundamentalist Christian correspondence school located in Del Norte, Colorado which issues religious degrees only. According to the State of Colorado, Patriot's ""degrees or diplomas have no state recognition"". PBU is not accredited by any agency recognized by the Department of Education. It has been called a diploma mill, lacking sufficient academic standards to award degrees.""(wikipedia) Buying a degree does not make a person learned it makes a person less than trustworthy. This book is written in a childish style leading the reader to believe that perhaps the good Doctor needs to finish grade school before getting a ""Doctorate"". SAD to see such trash being used to educate young children."
1,Shallow pseudoscience,"If you're looking for a thoroughly researched, well documentedwork on possible ""living dinosaurs"" or other prehistoric creatures, this is not it. Sad to say, Hovind's approach is very unscholarly. Many of his stories and sensational claims have been disputed even by fellow creationists. For example, he touts an alleged ""plesiosaur"" carcass that was by all evidenec a decayed basking shark (see ""Plesiosaur or Shark"", http://paleo.cc/paluxy/plesios.htm). I hope that most readers (including young oones, whom the book evidently targets) have enough science background and analytical skills to spot the lack of substance and rigor in Hovind's assertions, and do not spread his unfounded claims to others."
1,Hilarious!,"This is the funniest book I've ever read... how can people throw out all of their logic and reason and believe this garbage? Not to mention ""Dr"" Hovind purchased his degree through Patriot University, widely known as a diploma mill. Anyone that doubts that can check the accreditation of the school. I do feel that an accredited school should award him a real honorary doctorate in B.S. though!"
4,Provokes one to consider what is presented,"I found the book to very interesting. My wife read the book first and I, second. I completed the book in one sitting as I found myself pulled into what the author was saying. I concur that we should not merely dismiss things we are not familiar with. May more books, such as this one, be presented to us."
4,Bible's Fear,"I havn't read this...yet, but I am not at all surprised that the literal Christians are in Big-Time Fear of this & other cryptozoology/scientific finds. Notice, in the Bible, most of it's entire stories are ego-trips & fantasies. Yet, cryptozoology is: science. Given, there have been people willing to fool people by fake photographs & casts thruout history. Then again, just look at the coelacanth; a fish that lived before dinosaurs yet found in the 1930s off Africa. Of course, if a person fancies DENIAL, let that person be even though hard facts are shown to prove that person wrong. Just look at The Holocaust."
1,I wish I could give it 0,"The illustrations are lovely, but the agenda of Mr. (I will not refer to him as Dr. since his degree comes from a diploma mill) Hovind is quite clear in this book. This book claims to base it's ""facts"" upon science which is patently dishonest. If you want a good laugh, pick up the book, but you can achieve similar mirth by simply doing a search on Kent Hovind and reading the miriad of sites exposing him for what he is."
4,Great young readers introduction to cryptozoology,"I was pleased to be asked to illustrate for this book by Bill Gibbons and Kent Hovind. As a wildlife artist I am fascinated by natural mysteries and I have loved the subject of cryptozoology since I was very young. While growing up I had mostly read accounts only of Loch Ness and Bigfoot. When first asked to participate in this book I made certain they would venture far beyond the ""run of the mill"" accounts of Nessie and Bigfoot. This little book enlightens the reader to a myriad of mysterious animals sighted worldwide by reliable eyewitnesses. ""Claws, Jaws & Dinosaurs"" is a first of its kind Creation Science book dedicated to the subject of cryptozoology as evidence of a young earth. Whether of not readers agree with the view of Creation Science, if they enjoy cryptozoology, they will want this little book in their personal library."
4,"Cudas Hydrosox -- comfortable watershoe, slipper, gadabout shoe","I like to use aqua shoes as houseslippers, but they ususally have black rubber soles that leave ugly marks on the floors. I took a chance on ordering Cudas Hydrosox hoping for reasonable quality and fit and non-marring no-slip soles. And that's what I got. These are pretty sturdy, and they fit better than any of the several other brands I've had. They're extremely comfortable, and they look good. The soles are durable -- almost-clear latex composition, very nonslip, totally non-marring. These are sturdy enough to use when driving. I wear them on short errrands -- the coffeeshop, supermarket, etc. I say 4-stars (not 5 only because nothing is perfect!), whereas I'd rate all the other brands I've tried as no better than 3-stars."
2,Insert came apart after first day,"Looked and felt fine out of the box. Only wet for a few hours launching my boat and the next day I noticed the insert came unglued. Looks like it uses just a little glue to keep them in, which is too bad, a few stitches would go along way especially at $25, these are the same quality as the $7 Walmart used to carry. To be fair, at this price range, I doubt you'll fair much better regardless of brand."
3,A Slight Innacuracy,"The version of ""Nadia's Theme"" (Theme from The Young and the Restless) isn't actually the one you're expecting. I believe it's actually the original arrangement made for ""Bless the Beasts and the Children"". So what later became the Young and the Restless theme (the one that was a hit) still remains unreleased on CD.Hopefully, we can see that version on a future release. Maybe they could get ""Little Ballerina Blue"" on one while they're at it.Still, some great stuff here."
3,Not totally an instrumental,I was excited to find this album. I bought it but was horrified to find a loud vocal on the first track. The rest of the music is all instrumental but this one track simply JARS you when it plays. Very disappointing!
5,Great book to understand forgiveness,Great book to understand forgiveness - it is a good companion book along with Betty's other books. I recommend it.
3,Not what I had hoped for.,"Didn't realize I'd bought from a broker...took several days for the order to be filled and mailed...book was in acceptable condition...even though it arrived within the amazon timeframe of a few weeks, i had hoped to get the book earlier so i could start using it for my class."
3,"Very Cool Item, but Cheap Construction","This is a very cool item that overall I am glad I bought, but I have to say it's not very well made. The hinge is very flimsy feeling and I'm sure after heavy use it will fall apart. For this reason I try to use mine very sparingly. So far it hasn't fallen apart, but the only thing holding both halves together is a tiny strip of plastic.Decent for the money, I suppose though."
3,Good enough,The case looks cool to look at. It easily holds my memory cards - i definetly would recommend this if ur looking for a strong sturdy case.
2,"Pretty case, too bad it doesn't work","Despite some of the warnings on here I decided to give this case a try as it seemed to be perfect for carrying my disks in my backpack. I was disappointed. Knowing that some people had problems I took extra care to push my SD cards down into the proper locations inside the case. I carried the case in my hand from my kitchen to my office and guess what happened? Yup. The SD cards were rolling around, they broke free without any badgering. So mine didn't work. If they made the rubber soft then it would hold, but they didn't. Too bad.I suggest getting a small camera case, they make some ""harder""-shell full-zipper ones pretty cheap - $5. Keep your little plastic cases inside that."
1,Beware!,"This case WILL NOT properly hold Sony Memory Pro Duo cards. The will flop around loose in the case, so it is as bad as not even having a case. I bought it to hold the Pro Duo memory cards, so it it worthless to me. It might hold other memory cards, but I would make sure before I buy it."
5,Excellent product!,"This case arrived from the shipper amazingly fast. It is well made and does exactly what I needed. Only one (very minor) problem cropped up; I use CompactFlash cards, and have one older 340MB Microdrive, which is a bit thicker than most CF cards. If I load that card in the case, I can't fill the opposite side with a CF card or the holder won't close.I can't imagine this will affect many people, but it is worth knowing."
3,Nice case,"Pros:Holds many formats securely. Carefully, insert SD or Memory Sticks contact ends first, then push in the remainder. If you push them in that way, they should stay secure.Cons:I would not recommend dropping this case. It will pop open."
5,Lot of facts,Love this book. Taught me things I didn't know about. Also explains things I didn't understand. It arrived neat and well packaged and in a timely matter.
3,Good read for baseball fans,Bought this for my 10 year old grandson. He thought it would be fun to see the stats. Will see if it inspires him to set goals
3,"OK set, but wouldn't buy again","The set we bought by the same name includes 6 activities - volcano, microscope, earth and moon, weather, crystals, and t-rex. The volcano is a lot of fun. It comes with a volcano shaped mold, then you mix up a sand/plaster mixture included to make it look more like a real volcano, then use vinegar, baking soda, and food color (again to make it look more real) to make the volcano go off.We had a hard time with the microscope since it's pretty cheap. Just a mirror and no light, so you've got to have really good light to even begin. The crystals and earth/moon have been disappointing as well.We've had fun taking the mini weather station outside to check the weather, and my son like to put together the t-rex.So we've been pleased with a few of the activities, but overall it isn't something I would buy again."
3,Incomplete Sjpment,The chemistry set was incomplete and misleading. It does not contain additional experiments. Also box was incomplete and missing pieces.
4,"Excellent compilation, but stick to the non-DVD version","Yes, I can afford to say that, because paying the Amazon price for this album isn't worth the bonus DVD. It's a lacklustre performance recorded in Singapore as kind of a throwaway; I'd give this collection five stars if it wasn't so expensive.In other words, the DVD should be a freebie, especially given the state of the lagging record industry.That being said, this is a comprehensive singles album that's essential for non-Suedeheads as a starting point. Die-hards will complain that it doesn't contain their brilliant b-sides, but then they probably don't understand the meaning behind the word ""Singles"" (as in something that actually got released AS a single???).But if you buy this and love it, you should definitely spend the extra coin for ""Sci-Fi Lullabies""; one of the best b-side compilations this side of the JAMC's ""Barbed Wire Kisses""."
1,Have any of you listened to this album,"Are you people actually listening to him or just jumping on the Jay-Z band wagon. It is a shame that I could not give this album 0 stars, cause this is what it deserves. Completely weak lyrical content, same rubbish that we hear from Jay-Z but worse.. hoes, money, private jets blah blah. How on earth can anyone who listens to this relate to it."
5,Memph Bleek is .....,"the hottest new rapper out there! The Song ""Memphis Bleek Is ..."" is a great song. Jay-Z, Beanie Sigel, Da Ranjahz ,Diamonds In Da Rough, Noreaga and Not to Mention Ja Rule make guest apearances on this Album."
1,Microphone arm broke after 7m of use.,"This is Mom writing. I wouldn't recommend this product. My daughter was 8 when she received this last Christmas. It broke in September in 2 places. A microphone geared to the use this one demands should be able to stand up to the use. The ""flexible"" mic arm wire broke in two places - by the ear and the mic end where it connects. This to me in a design flaw, not from overuse from a child who is sitting down while using it. She did store it in her big DS carrying case, which may have contributed to this, but the headset/microphone is made to make it quiet to use her DS, right? - makeing it a necessity to travel with and again, it couldn't stand up to that type of use. I wouldn't recommend this unless it will hand on a wall and the flexable mike arm is never flexed as it is intended to be."
1,"0 stars, if I could","Like some of the others, this product blew my daughters' microphones, too, only we couldn't get them repaired. The boom gave out fairly quickly, too, due to poor design. VERY disappointed."
1,Disappointed,"I have Brain Age 2 for the Nintendo DS Lite which worked perfectly with the microphone until I plugged in these headphones. Since plugging in the headphones the voice recognition does not work, with or without the headphones being plugged in. When the makers of the headphones, Turtle Beach, was contacted with the problem I was told, ""Sorry we are not liable for other products""."
1,Beware! Do Not Plug One Of These Into Your DS Lite or DSI,"The bad reviews for this product were absolutely correct. Do not plug these into your DS Lite or DSI or you will more than likely blow the built in mic under the screen. The built in mic under the screen on my daughters DSI no longer works after having used these headphones. All 3 of these headphones we purchased didn't last long anyway as they are very easily broken, with both ear pieces and the mic boom breaking in a very short time."
2,Broken internal cord (plug) after first time use!,"""Very good headphone daddy...."" this was my daughter's elating outburst on first trial and I even got a thank you from her after purchasing this and other packs as her birthday present.That, unfortunately, quickly turned into dissappointment, when all of a sudden the sound started distorting and eventually died! Cannot repair it because the break was by the plug to the Nintendo DS plug!Definitely was a good product as I listened to some of the music on my daughter's games and was impressed but only foro a short time which was annoying part. Unfortunately cannot return back to the US for exchange, I am 6,000 miles away!"
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"Sorry Turtle Beach but your headphones blow the mic in the Nintendo DS Lite!!! We have three DS's in our house. One for me, one for my son one for my daughter. I purchased the kids a black and a pink pair of these earphones for their DS's. The earphones work great, sound great and the mic is fantastic, HOWEVER, try your DS mic without the headphones after you use these a couple of times, it's shot! We blew all three mics, sent all three in for repair but it wasn't until my niece used the headphones on hers and her mic blew that I made the connection.BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK, TURTLE BAY WILL NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DAMAGE!"
2,Nintendo earforce headphones,I have to agree with all the other poor reviews. My son is not happy with the microphone. After a few times it does not sit by his face right and he has also had connection problems.
1,Ouch!,"I was hoping this would be the answer to my back pain. I tried it and it's good in theory, but in practice, it's uncomfortable in the extreme. It's not flat enough and wide enough to support the area between ribs and hips, so it's like lying on a mattress with a 3"" lump in the middle. Unfortunately, I took it out of the package to try it, (How else can you find out if it works?) and I see that I can't get my money refunded. Bummer!"
5,"Comfort, at last!","This lumbar roll for sleeping is the best! Seldom wake up with back pain now!!!It is worth the price, and then some. Thank you Mr MacKenzie!!!"
2,didn't help me,"I had great expectations that this support would ease my lower back pain while sleeping, but unfortunately it did not. It is large and you feel almost silly wearing it, like one of those blow up beach life saver rings, but surprisingly it wasn't too bad sleeping with. I'm thinking a wedge to elevate the legs may work better for me. I did try using it several times and still awoke with the same pain. It didn't seem to help me and I could understand that some people would have a hard time falling asleep or staying asleep with it on (it feels awkward). It was worth a try...it now sits under my bed collecting dust :("
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"Desperate people in pain will try almost anything to get some relief. This pillow did nothing to help my lumbar pain, and, in fact, was uncomfortable to use. Try some other remedy. I now have a collection of pillows, wedges, and over the counter pain patches that do nothing to help."
2,It's too thick,I found the roll to be a good idea but badly designed. It's too thick and too stiff to do the job. I found an inflatable back cusion to work much better.
3,be careful on the size,I have been doing the Mckenzie stretches and exercises for three years now-this has really helped me to deal with consistent back pain from a slight tear of a disc-and prevent further injury. Be careful when you try this on-they say you can't return it if opened and they run too large per the description. If you have anything less than a 40 inch waist you need to consider the medium rather than the L/XL. They probably need a few more sizes and they definitely need to do something about the strap. Otherwise it's probably going to work and I like the fact I can roll over with it on.
1,Nearly destroyed my back,"I tried this one night. It's just too narrow and tall to support the arch in my back smoothly - in other words, it holds a small part of my arch unnaturally above the rest.I went back to a towel, which I can customize to my back.I've been trying to sleep on my back. Then I found that when I slept flat on my back, it hurt because the arch wasn't being supported. That's why I bought this. At this point I've been trying to use the towel, but I'm also going back to sleeping on my side sometimes."
2,Night Roll Lumbar too bulky and big...,"The size of the roll is too large to fit comfortably on my lower back (I'm 5' 2"")and my side waistline when I sleep on my side."
3,"sharp knife, but needs maintenance",This knife is great for tree grafting. However the knife must be cleaned immediately after the task in order to avoid quick rust build up on the blade.
1,Buy another card!,"I bought this card and was sorry I did. Out of the 5 games I had requiring 3D acceleration, it was only compatible with 2. Diamond is going away, so good luck getting tech support. I suggest you buy any other NDIVIA graphics card."
1,Not Supported,Diamond sold off their video card business soon after this card was released back in 1999-2000. I've never had the Generic TNT2 drivers work quite right for it. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.
2,poor driver support in W2K,"The shipping driver for W2K does not support hardware acceleration. NVidia has a beta driver, but it is really buggy, and Diamond/S3 has not announced any plans for their own driver.If you need hardware acceleration in Windows 2000, this is not the card for you!"
4,Awesome sound,"I've owned one of these for about 5 years and I'm very happy with it. It produces a very lush chorus sound and very little noise. I've demoed other chorus pedals and so far I've stuck with the Cool Cat.I've heard complaints about the quality of the input and output jacks, but I've had no problems at all.All in all, it's a great pedal for the $$$."
2,Bad conditions,"I got this for my 14 year old son's Birthday and when he opened the box, one of the frosted spaces had ""the frost"" chiped off. One of the knights had its head broken completely off! and some of the pieces were somewhere else in the packaging so you can tell that it wasn't packaged with care. it looked like they just threw some pieces in there. The pads on the bottom of some chess pieces were coming off and one of the pieces had one of its pads ripped iff. Half of it was ripped off. I bought it new and you could tell it was used multiple times before. there are staines and marks on the frosted spaces."
2,Decent Board -- Crummy Pieces,"This chess set is definitely nothing to write home about. Everything another reviewer said about the poor quality was spot on. The felt pads on the bases are peeling off several pieces...right out of the box. Several pieces had chunks broken off of them at the factory, but were put in the set anyway. I don't know what the glass of the black pieces is made of, and I don't want to. Can cheap plastic be mixed with glass? That's kind of what it looks like.The board is a mirror with the squares etched into it and the edges beveled. Looks nice for decoration, but I wouldn't play on it. The etching is easily scratched and isn't good quality either...little spots of missing etching here and there.I've seen this very same set selling for $60 elsewhere. Thank goodness for Amazon. I feel I got my $20 worth, but just barely."
3,Interesting budget CD,"This disc compiles 10 of Glen's Christmas songs from several sources, all recorded for Capitol/EMI. Most tracks are taken from Glen's 1968 LP, That Christmas Feeling. But, this CD also includes his 1972 single, I Believe In Christmas, plus some songs recorded for Christmas For The 90's Vols. 1-2 in 1990. Just 10 songs, but nicely chosen."
3,missing tracks,"I have the album from my days in Nam. This cd is missing the Carpenter song ""Little Altar Boy"", the best song on the album."
3,Classic Stuff 4 stars -1 due to the addition on two 1990's tracks,This is mostly a 1960's recording. It is the best 'old feeling' Christmas stuff by Glen and the sound quality is great! There is one or two more recent 1990's tracks included here which are ok but not a patch on the original stuff.Here you will find most of the songs are taken from his 1968 capitol album Hear Glen in top form with lush orchestra and backing singers. They sure don't make 'em like this anymore and why they don't is beyond me as they sound as if they were recorded more earnestly with real atmosphere as are most 60'S artists on Capitol Christmas releases.
1,What you see you don't get!,"[ASIN:B000P50PEQ 5' INDOOR / OUTDOOR Deluxe Cycas Palm Tree]]-Ordered three of these trees was very diappointed with what I received. What was depicted in their photos, in no way represented what I received. It makes me believe that there are products should not be purchased online. I will now have to go out and purchase these trees, locally. Seymour C. Falk"
2,Limited Functionality is worth very little in a remote.,"In fairness: I'm using this on a DVD/VCR combo, which many people seem to feel is especially challenging. It didn't take me that long to find the right code to control my DVD player. But the only controls that actually function are Play, Pause and Stop. No forward/rewind, no arrows for making menu selections. Therefore, basically useless to me."
4,"Not bad! Not great, but not bad!","I've tried the spaghetti & meatballs (which is really darned good), the hawaiin nuggets (which I'd rather not have to try again), and the vegetarian steak... The Vegetarian steak is definitely edible, to the point where I'd be ok with eating it again.The ""steak"" bits are quite tasty, have a good texture, and quite plentiful. The biggest issue with the veggie steak is the texture of the vegetables: on the box, it shows all sorts of nice yummy crisp looking veggies... whereas it turns out its really just a gelatneous goo. It's pretty yucky looking, but it tastes decent.Definitely good for camping, or if you need to eat kosher on a business trip."
3,when need to eat and short on time,"Let's face it. This is not home cooked or what you would get in a fancy restaurant. But when you're not home/short on time and want something fairly tasty/nutricious, this will fit the bill. You don't need refrigeration or a microwave and if you can add a salad and/or fruit, you've got yourself a nice meal. ENJOY!!"
1,Please don't support this film in any way,"Were do I start, first of all Tim Burton spat in the face of the real creator, this was totally not what the original story was like. He should not have given it the same name. He should have called it; I couldn't think of anything original, so I used someone elses good work and stunk it up!"
1,No offense to Markie Mark ...,I love those six-pack abs and I've enjoyed some of Tim Burton's stuff too BUT ... they never should have made this! Why mess with a classic! Another dissapointing Hollywood bomb. Big and loud with none of that savoir faire that made the original so great! What a shame!
1,"Like A Fart, In Movie Form",How the hell can you make a movie with talking monkeys totally suck? It should have been a slam dunk.
3,"Brought to you by the creator of ""Lost in Space""","The First Planet of the Apes(the good one) was a masterful work intriging in its sutlety and well deserving in its reputation. This movie hits you with all the skill of a blast from a shotgun. You see in the first planet of the apes the other humans didn't talk for a reason, to have them talk would have messed up a perfectly good story(like it does in the 2001 verson). So instead of seeing the new ""supercharged"" one just stick to the classics."
1,This was a B Movie.,"This waste of film would make a great edition of Mystery Science Theater 3000.The plot was contrived and stupid. The best actor/actress in the movie was a monkey (not one of those ""talking apes""; a real monkey). There was a truly twisted love triangle between the hero (a remarkably poorly acted textbook Milus Gloriosis [aka ""Macho War Guy""]), the herione (a talking monkey, er, ape), and some random girl who really is not very important to the story. Not to say there is a story. The plot is nonsensical and far too convienient. There is none of the intelligence or ""thought-provoking-ness"" of the first Planet of the Apes...this movie is more of an advertisement of what Hollywood can do with make-up.I was also very insulted by the potrayel of Lincon as a monkey. That was bad."
1,Very Stupid!,This was one this most stupid movies I have ever seen! the ending was so dumb. this movie was made because of the flow of cocaine/xtc/meth/whatever and money in hollywood. I rated it a 1 because it did have pretty good fx.
2,Disappointing,"Overall - the movie had potential. It has decent acting, a good story/material to work with and a good director. The results however are lacking. First of all, the plot lacks coherence and logic, especially the ending. Secondly, the music fails to live up to its potential. The makeup/costumes are the best in the film and probably some of the best I have seen.As for the DVD, while it has good features overall, the director's commentary is awful. He rambles and stumbles over his own sentences and it is hard to tell what he is saying. More fustrating, he does not want to share his vision of the film and its ending: all for the sake of not ruining a ""possible sequel."" I must say, for a film that needed explanation, this one failed miserable. I would not recommend it to those who seek to find more answers because none will be given."
3,Planet of the Apes,This moive is good for the most part but not at the end. I think at the end of the moive is stupid! That is why I rated 3 stars.
4,A Great Movie with an Interesting Twist,"This was a very well done movie. It keeps the viewers interest for almost the entire time. The costumes and makeup were flawlessly done, and they really make you feel like the actors are actually apes. The effects in this movie are well done, especially the time travel sequences and the crash sequence. The ending leaves one thinking about exactly what happened and the card that explains the time travel (included with the DVD) helps the understanding greatly. Overall this is an awesome movie with some incredible special features."
2,Nice looks but poor story,"Everything was lacking here. There's a social/religious message here, but it definitely doesn't get far. It's shallow, empty, boring, dumb. Unnecessary may be the best word. Avoid."
2,The jungle VIP (Vocal Ineloquence Preferable),"Story re-working is terrific fun but the need to keep the certificate down has meant only the whimsy and not the menace has been retained from the original.Whalberg's sermon on the mount lacks the gravitas of Shakespeare's 'Henry V'. It's more like a little league baseball pep talk on helium.Estella Warren needs to lay off the burgers or the apes will end up swinging around her thighs rather than tree trunks.Thade didn't give up, you have to give him that. However, judging by the shape of Whalberg's spaceship it should have been Tesla sitting in the chair at the end."
4,Highly entertaining sci-fi remake.,"Remake to the popular 1968 original stars Mark Wahlberg as a pilot who crashlands onto an alien planet where apes rule and humans are their slaves. This re-imagining obviously won't play well with fans of the original, but holds appeal to those looking for straight-out action/adventure. Fast-paced, pulse-pounding, funny, and even rousing, this is ideal summer-based entertainment. The ending is a bit silly, however (still enjoyably so)."
2,Not good but watchable,"Sorry it did'nt live up to all the hype that it was given,yes it was watchable but only once,gave it 2 stars for the neat ending,looks like it was left again for a sequel,the space ship walberg was in was very poor espeically the end sequence where it landed near the statue,what a piece of luck landing there..anyway the sequel will be better because it can't be worse...."
2,"makeup guy needs to find new director, let's start again!!!!","Well this really was a disappointment! Fans of the original, this will disappoint. On the other hand, if you appreciate mindless eye candy like ""The Mummy"", then, by all means, buy this.Burton's movie has no character development, little in the way of a plot, and an extremely improbable scenario. Were gorillas and orangutans on the spaceship? How do those species reproduce without any females?The chimp should have crash landed at the end so that way there could be no dreadful ending with that little pod just happening to crash on earth when there was no sign that the spaceship was anywhere near earth in the beginning.20th Century Fox -- give the makeup guy another job doing a real Planet of the Apes movie, with a decent director.And while you are at it, how about a director's cut DVD of 'Conquest of the Planet of the Apes' the way it should have been in the beginning!!!!!!!! Save us the bad endings!!!"
3,okimguilty,"i gave it a 3 stars for one reason. WHY MARK WAHLBERG???? to bad, a great special effects and kudos to Tim Burton for his visuals. Charlton Heston maybe as old as my grandfather but i bet he do a better job than Wahlberg. Get rid of Wahlberg and throw in Heston, i give the new version a 5 star."
2,OK but not what it could have been,"The special effects and makeup are visually stunning, as is the picturesque world the artists who worked on it created. BUT as movies go.....not good. The characterizations were vague to the nth power and Mark W just wasn't dynamic enough in the lead role. The female lead.....Helena Bonham Carter as a gorilla....was the only character I actively cared about, but even her we don't really get to know all that well. By the time the movie is over you feel like something was missing, like this movie could have been great ""if only"". All in all, this DVD is worth renting but not buying."
1,A total waste - stick with the original,"There is not one thing I liked about this movie. There is no reason to compare it with the original, because this film is nothing like it. Even on its own merit, however, it's no good. There was basically nothing to it. It is not even that interesting that the astronaut lands on a planet populated with intelligent apes, because in this version the humans are just the same, they are just inferior beings. It really doesn't make any sense. The movie is basically just a typical ""good guy must escape from the bad guy"" story. I guess if you're only looking for some action this movie is for you. It if you want even the slightest bit to think about this is definitely not the film for you."
1,One Of The Worst Movies Ever Made!!!!!!!!!!,"I have to say that this is one of the worst movies ever made. I would give this trash a zero rating if only I could! In the 1968 version We saw Taylor's anguish, in this movie its like I'm on a planet ruled by apes oh well. Just a really shallow story with really shallow character development. The only saving grace would have to be the in jokes but even those are only funny because of the power of the 1968 film. I'll stick with Taylor and Zira. It would be nice if some one would attempt to actually film the Novel Monkey Planet?"
1,how did this monkey flick get like this?,"An absolute mess. Burton seems unsure which Apes movie he's making, so he throws in bits of everything including the TV series and mixes it all up. It's bound to suffer comparisons with the original, but apart from the FX and ape makeup, it struggles against the other movies too. Even the studio sets, the forest, ape city all look a bit cheap, and the fast pacing only makes it seem rushed. I can excuse the ending on account that it's in the original novel, but in the context of this film it makes no sense whatsoever."
1,Disaster Flick,Laughably bad remake of the 1968 classic.Everything is wrong in this big-budget shlock-fest.Worth renting once - it IS somewhat interesting -but contains one of the worst endings of all-time.Huh???
1,it sucks,"It is an atrocity that this laughably bad movie, received the hype which it did. This is the worst movie I've seen in quite some time. The acting goes from wooden to over the top awful. Their is not even that much action, for a movie that is hyped up to be action-packed."
2,The Trailer is the Movie!,"If you've seen the trailer, you saw the movie. The trailer doesn't miss a thing. The movie was the worst I've seen in years. Tim Burton, I'm sure, is ashamed with what came out of the cutting room. Regardless the amount of talent involved in this flick, it was abhorent - as a whole."
3,Ho hum.,"Not having seen the original Charleton Heston version of Planet of the Apes, I can't compare the two. However, it certainly can't be WORSE than this.Not that the movie is bad. It's just.. rather dull. Granted, the makeup is quite realistic (though the special effects seemed a trifle silly) but overall, the acting, the plot.. the whole story was overblown.I had expected much more, and came away glad that I had just rented the movie.Watch if you must, watch if you want to see what changes have been made in comparison to the original Planet of the Apes, but: don't expect very much."
3,A wasted effort.,"I'm being generous with three stars. It's more like 2 1/2. As with most blockbusters, these days, you get your great visuals and costumes at the expense of a good plot and characters. The script was pure trash from beginning to end. Here are some examples of the screenplay: ""I'm having a bad hair day"", ""Get your hands off me you damn dirty human"", ""Can't we just all get along?"". These are lines that my 12-year old would have come up with for a movie. Unfortunately, this type of writing seems to be the norm. The casting is ok, except for Wahlberg. A department store dummy would have had more life."
2,"If you have seen the original, then this is simply bad","I was expecting to see somthing new with this ""revisiting"" of planet of the apes movie. Instead, it is just an amatuer attempt to add some insight to the thought-provoking themes of the original movies. The first half of the movie was a complete waste, the slave/master issue was clearly dealt with in more detail in the original movie. So many movies these days focus so much on set design and makeup and not enough on plot or character development. The ending was surprising I thought, as I a couple of things could have happened in my opinion. Overall, just another modern action/sci-fi movie with no good plot, characters or action for that matter"
2,The old movies are much better!,"First of all, the female apes look like Michael Jackson and Prince. I was expecting them to sing ""Beat It"" or ""Purple Rain."" What's the point anyways? In order for the remake to work, they would've needed to totally make this spectacular. Instead, this is simply a rehash and doesn't live up to the original. At least with the Charlie's Angels remake, they added humor to it and made it fun. This one fails to impress. Maybe if Drew Barrymore or Cameron Diaz had been the astronaut it would have worked..."
3,Boring.,"I tried very hard to set aside the original movie and watch this as its own individual film. I was doing well until the damn thing reminding me that there was one! Several quotes were reused. or at least paraphrased. Some of the original locations were used as well. Many would call this a ""homage"" to the original. Whatever.I have read the book that all the films were based from and this film departs from it almost from the start.Few surprises, muffled actors, and laughable (not to mention confusing) plot twists. All and all, not good.The DVD tries to pack in a few extras, most of them pretty typical. For the really bored viewer, you can see the character makeup and costume tests! Wow!Final suggestion. Buy the original films in the box set and check out ""Behind the Planet of the Apes"" Very good."
2,Ape Lincoln Denouement Is Ridiculous,Looking at this film objectively and trying not to make any comparisons to the original I found it to be just average filmmaking. The story and character development is very minimal. The denouement is just ridiculous.
3,not a very good version,"this is tim burtons adaption of the original movie from 68.the story strays way off course from the original but is way funnier.marky mark stars in it.oh yeah!now will take it seriously.as if it wasnt bad enough we were watching a bad remake of an old classic,now it stars one of the worst bands in histories brothers.bbbboooooooooooooo!the kids will like it.tim burton directed it.besides the lack of keeping with the original and bad casting,this movie is good.it is a disapointment from a lot of his far better movies though.there are a lot of racial undertones in it.they are done in a funny way.is this even possible?its kind of a down but still manages a 3 star rating due to tim burtons masterful save."
3,Planet of the Apes DVD,"Paul Giamatti as Limbo is the highlight of the film. It's a ""B"" movie for sure, always was, and if you watch Tim Burton's version, you'll see no different, but I am a sucker for Burton's trademark visions, and applied to this tired classic sci-fi film, the mating of the two comes off as a pretty decent film for the genre."
2,Old Fogey- Liked the original,"The movie was fun, but it did not compare to the original with Charlton Heston. That was a classic. Also, I hated the ending."
1,Marky Mark and the Monkey Bunch,"First off since this movie is not a remake of the original is should not bare the same name as the original so I have given it a new title ""Marky Mark and the Monkey Bunch"" a more appropriate title for this modern picture. This movie had all the makings of something spectacular with a great producer and solid idea to go on with all the new technology to boast, however it fell flat on its face. The character development was horrible, and the soundsets they were filmed on looked about as fake as you could get with todays technology. It's just too bad that todays generation is going to be exposed to a whole series of Marky Mark and the Monkey Bunch. Take my advice and stick with the classics and boy cott any future releases of Marky Mark and the Monkey Bunch. It's just too bad the original Planet of the Apes had too be defiled by Tim Burtons mistake, its almost sad to see the modern generation getting ripped off like this."
1,Awful,"You can't improve on the original and Tim Burton should not even have tried. The heavy handed moralizing about racism was patronizing in the extreme. ""Oh, let's make the human female real attractive, but as dumb as dirt and soften the features of the sensitive, intelligent and liberal female chimpanzee to make her more sexy. So the ""hero"" is attracted to her to show cross-species 'lurve' is possible."" Bleech!I hate it went a movie director lays it on that thick.I do not think the effects improved on the original apart from the running on all fours thing.The ending is contrived beyond belief.All in all, a complete turkey."
2,i'm saddened,"you know, i was excited about seeing this film, after all, tim burton doesn't fail, but unfortunately he did, or at least the screenwriter did...why burton signed on after reading the script fails my knowledge. and why mark whalberg and other quite good actors also signed up after reading the script fails my understanding as well."
3,Not As Good As Original,"The new updated version of Planet of The Apes may have better special effects,in fact Tim Burton's usual use of gothic imagery is as stunning as ever.The acting maybe excellent-especially Mark Wahlberg's performance.The action and pace of the movie shifts along quite nicely-but it is ruined by an awful ending.In comparison to the ending of the original film it left me quite dissappointed with this film.I know they had to change things around but the ending they came up with for this film was predictable and also quite ridiculous.The ape effects were quite incredible-in fact they almost looked too human and almost good-looking.Some of the scenes are spectacular especially the closing battle scene-well especially the build up.But overall I was really looking forward to this movie for a long time,but in the end I thought it was rather disappointing."
4,enjoyable monkeying around,"I had a wonderful time watching this movie and recently ordered it to add to my Planet of the Apes collection of DVDs, videos, and books. I've enjoyed different versions of the Planet of the Apes since I was a little girl. It should be pointed out though that Boulle's original novel had an abstract ending. The original Planet of the Apes movie series also involved unrealistic ideas like damaged space ships being salvaged by chimps who repaired and operated them despite coming from a rather primitive culture. The 2001 version presents us with an ending that might indicate that yet again more chimps have managed to travel through a space warp, or the planet that is shown at the finale of the film (which is very much like the finale of the original novel) is the Planet of the Apes in the future. Either way, the 2001 movie's abstract finale didn't ruin the fun. It just made me want to see more."
1,Not Satisfied,The dvd became un watchable after about the 10th time of watching had to throw it away and buy from a local retail store.
5,For Him,He was very excited about getting this movie! He watched it right away. Its a great investment...ty so much for it
2,Welcome to the Monkey House,"A decent blockbuster yet a weak film overall, Tim Burton`s ""Planet of the Apes"" is surely lacking. The set design is ok, the costumes are appropriate and some of the acting is actually good, but the characters are flat and the plot is way too contrived. A watchable flick to pass the time, it doesn`t possess the absorbing atmosphere os most of the director`s oeuvre, becoming just another mildly entertaining popcorn-movie. Tim Burton could do better than this by-the-numbers adventure.Watchable but far from memorable."
1,Great potential...Big Failure,"When you watch a movie you should be constantly being drawn into the climax, but what happens if the draw is bigger, much bigger then the climax? Planet of The Apes happens! And you then ask yourself? why in the world did I pay money to see that?This movie has a great begging and so much potential, but as soon as it should get good it falls flat on it's face, and keeps going down. Don't waist money on this!"
2,"""Get your hands off me, you damn dirty ape!""","Movies nowadays! I mean come on! The old ones were just OK and this ones pretty bad. This movie relies A LOT on special effects, and not the story or character development. I'm not saying that movies shouldn't use cool FX, but they shouldn't rely on it. By watching this, I thought the movie makers wrote the story as they went along. You can tell this movie was made in hurry, maybe if they worked harder on it, it would be half way decent. However, this movie is very pleasing to look at, the whole ape city, and the costumes, and special effects. But despite the Eye Candy, this was just a piece of ape ...."
4,I really liked this!,"What a fun flick this is! It surprised and delighted me! I'm not a huge fan of Tim Burton, but this is a very under-rated fun film. Walhberg let me down (perhaps he tried to anchor the whole thing in realism a little too much) but the rest of the cast and the movie were a joy to watch. A good time!"
1,"So Far Below the Original, its Laughable","Need I say more? I thought this film was a waste of time, money and talent. ALl the makeup in the universe could not make it any better - the story was deeply flawed, the performances stale, and yes, even the monkey suits looked fake. Gee - you'd think the filmakers would have borrowed a page from the original and stuck to a formula that worked back then - a plot for one, suspense for another, and actors who transcended the species rather than offended it. Quite honestly, after seeing this flick (on an IMAX screen no less) I'm not sure what the point to remaking ANY classic story really is if there is no compelling plot to move the story forward. A DUD."
2,Disappointing,"When I first heard back in 1991 that a remake of ""Planet Of The Apes"" was in the works, I was very interested. Over the years, plans came and fell through, different people submitted different scripts, and at the end of the day, this is what was produced.Another reviewer here called this film ""Brainless"", and that was pretty much what I was thinking while watching it. There's nothing to this movie -- it's an action piece with zero substance. The makeup is great, and the acting not bad, but the story is lacking.Not recommended. Tim Burton has done so much better."
1,Horrible Movie!!!!,"I watched this movie thinking that it would be great because most of it was excellent. It was well put together with decent special effects, but then it got to the end and I was horribly disappointed and ended up despising the movie as a result."
2,No more re-makes!,"Good effects but the story and character development were horrible. My brother brought this movie over to watch and my wife, my brother, myself and my dog were all snoozing halfway through the movie. This movie is easily the worst movie I saw in 2001. See the original with Charlton Heston - much better flick."
1,Planet of the Apes Mark Wahlberg,"This film was so bad that I could only stand to watch it for about 20 minutes. After the original Planet of the Apes series, this remake leaves a lot to be desired. The time and effort put into the original makeup and set design was not evident here. They could not even come up with an original title such as ""Planet of the Apes, a Lousy remake"""
3,Better then the original...,"I just got done watching this and...ehh. I mean, it was better then the original. Cause this had more convincing apes. But Mark Wahlberg kissed a monkey...what was up with that?? The best part of this DVD is the 2nd disc. The making of. I got to see more of the real chimpanzee. Them things are really funny. I'd love to have a pet chimp. They're amazingly smart. Anyway, where was I? Good one to rent first."
1,Disappointed,"I was so excited to see this movie, but found the character development completely lacking. The special effects were great and I would have enjoyed the plot, but I was so bummed with the characters I couldn't really enjoy that. For example - the little boy who you barely notice throughout the movie until the end when he is suddenly there with a defiant personality. That was the one which bothered me the most, I think. I haven't even seen the old movie, I am told I will enjoy that one."
1,one of the worst movies ever,"This movie was so bad, words cannot describe it. The plot was non-existant, the acting was horrible and the ending was completely random. I usually like Tim Burton movies but felt this was just an excuse to make another movie. No redeeming qualities. The only reason I gave it one star was that I could not give it zero stars. Save your money."
5,It's goooooood!,"In looking at this movie it's better then the original. The costumes are better then they were. The story line is written a little better, also it was good to see the cameo by Charlton Heston and you see they took a few lines from the original movie reworded them and it still works! Wahlberg equals the ability of Heston of the acting in the movie."
3,Good Up To Date Remake.....,"Being a huge fan of all the Planet of the Apes movies and having seen them all, I couldn't wait to see this movie. I saw this movie as soon as it was released at the theaters. I was not let down even though I must admit that the best thing about this movie is the fact that Mark Wahlberg is the main character!! Wahlberg plays Leo, a astronaut who crashes on a uncharted planet..... The Planet of the Apes where apes rule over humans. Very action packed film. We see Leo's desperate attempts to escape and find a way home despite the ruthless gorilla leader named Thade. The mission- to find the sacred temple where Leo might find all his answers. Excellent makeup effects and costume designs. Very action packed and a good up to date remake that won't disappoint."
5,I Loved everything,"But I loved Helena Bonham Carter the most.I was amazed at how Ms. Carter was able to beso femenine and sexy, and sooo appealingwhile wearing latex on her face.Wow!I think I'm in love.I don't know much about her performances, but I willcorrect this.I also think Mr. Burton is fantastic, I really likedall the characters, Mike Wahlberg was great - evvery one was.Do NOT hesitate, buy it and enjoy it.Watch Helena Bonham Carter, if this woman is notLOUDLY acclaimed, I'll eat my toes.I mean it.Lord P. Bermingham"
1,Sad....,"Whatever merits this movie could have where destroyed by Walhberg's atrocious acting and the ludicrous ending. The movie should be called ""THE DAY TIM BURTON SOULD OUT"". I think it's not wrong for a great director to try once and a while a project in pop-corn summer Hollywood movies. But at least he should have a decent script on hand. The movie has no heart and emotion at all."
3,Good Movie,I still prefer the original Planet of the Apes but for a remake this one isn't bad. Certainly worth the price I paid.
1,"All Hype, Nothing good about this movie","Don't waste your money on this overly marketed dung pile. I was very disappointed, especially being a (former) Tim Burton fan.It's amazing how much hype can be generated (bought) for such a poor movie. I still hear commercials about how this movie is THE ONE to buy this holiday season. It's all just marketing BS, don't believe it. I've never seen the original Planet of the Apes movies but from what I hear I should check them out. If you need to see this movie for some reason, rent it."
1,Beyond Awful...,"Notice the other films that people who brought this film also purchased: Laura Croft, Pearl Harber, Jurrasic Park. If you liked those movies then you should buy this movie.The only positive about this film is the acting of Helena Bonham Carter, though she cheapens herself by appearing in this crappy movie."
1,Pretty bad.,"The costumes are well done as is some of the special effects. BUT, I just could not get into this movie because the plot points don't make logical sense. I suspend my dis-belief when I'm watching movies, but with this movie it was impossible. 10 different times during the movie I would throw up my hands and say, ""WHAATT??? They wouldn't do that! That doesn't make sense!!"" I'm not saying that I'm a person that doesn't believe in Sci-Fi, not at all, but the logic that the characters exibit is contradictory... was just bad."
2,ON OF THE WORST MOVIES I EVER SEEN,"LET ME TELL YOU IHAVE SEEN THE ORIGINAL PLANET OF THE APES WITHCHARLES HESTON AND ITS THE BEST AND EVEN MY FAVIROTE,BUT THIS REMAKE WITH MARK WHALEBERG ITS COMPLETELY BORING IT MAY HAVE SOME GOOD PARTS AND VISUAL EFFECTS BUT DOSENT MAKE SENSE AT ALLIT ALL STATS INTHIS SPACE STATION AND THERES THIS ELECTROMAGNETIS STORM,AND THEY SEND A CHIMP TO SE WHAT EXACTLY WAS AND APPERNTLY CHIMP DESIPERES AND LATER MW GETS INSIDE TOAND ALL THIS CRAZYNESS WHICH MAKES NO SENCE THE WAY THE MOVIE ENDS ITS JUST STUPID. TRUST ME DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT ITS NOT WORTH IT"
3,Planet Of The Apes Revisited,"To really enjoy Planet of the Apes (2001), you have to love and appreciate the earlier movies. I love all of the original movies for all of their cheesiness as well as the creativity and the issue they addressed. The old Planet of The Apes movies addressed issues of class, racism, and how ignorant and cruel we as a society can be when we do not understand others. The predecessor of the new movie has already been creative, already been original, and the new movie caters to fans of the original movie, and was made to entertain. That it did. If you love the originals and have seen them all--and I have--then you will be entertained by the 2001 version. I never expected it to be a remake of the original and only went for the entertainment value; I expected only to be entertained, and I was!"
1,Very Lame,"The remake of Planet of the Apes has one of the most disappointing scripts I've seen in a long time. It seems like everything that happened was either obvious, or totally non-believable. I usually find it pretty easy to slip into the ""alternative reality"" of a movie; not with this one. So many things were just plain hard to accept I couldn't buy into it and feel a part of it. Very disappointing. The original was way way better, even if the visual effects weren't as stunning."
1,Rent the New one..Then go BUY the Classic with Heston,"Not much to say except that this film was hard to watch. It was SO BAD I will spare everyone from rambling on about how Awful. The ending is Stupid, the middle is Stupid, On second thought the ending is Beyond Stupid. What a waste.....I am a true Sci-Fi fan and have an extensive collection. I made the mistake of buying this garbage instead of renting it...Tim burton again destroys a movieJR"
1,What A Bad Movie,This was about the dumbest movie I have ever seen. Mark Wahlberg is a terrible actor. Maybe he should make Dirk Diggler II. What a waste of money and potential in making this movie. They could have come up with a much better story.This can't even compare to the classic Planet of the Apes.
3,Good but not gerat,"I love the special effects and the Ape costumes and makeup look great, but the original blows this semi remake away. Still not bad."
2,Apes lose their bananas,"The previews looked really good, but after seeing it, I didn't like it very much. The ending was the only part I liked, really cool Sci-Fi moment there. But other than that, this is nothing like the 1968 version or it's sequels. It was also not a very fun Summer movie. For the Summer of 2001, I'd have to rank Jurassic Park 3 and The Mummy Returns hire. Big disappointment."
2,Rediculous!,"The trailer for this film was excellent, thats why I wanted to see it. it looked intense, exciting, and even scary. Was it any of these things? NO! It actually started off very promising when Marc Wahlburg crashes down on the Planet of the Apes, and he and a bunch of natives are running from the apes. After that it goes down hill. It's all about Mark Wahlburg trying to get free from the planet. The Apes are rediculous. The make up is excellent and you can barely recognize Helena Bonham Carter, Tim Roth, and Michael Clarke Duncan, but I couldn;t help but laugh at these fine actors as they said their horrendoues dialogue, and believe me the dialogue was not meant to be funny. It lacked any excitment or intensity and was filled with bad performances especially from Mark Wahlburg and Estella Warren."
3,Good... but not as good as the original,I am not to sure what to say... the top is the best thing i'll say about this movie.ACTING- BDIALOUGE- BMUSIC- CPLOT- BThere you go!
2,Aperaham Lincoln,"What a hugh disappointment from one of my favorite directors, Tim Burton. No suspense, little action and a ""surprise ending"" that should have stayed a secret. The ending was totally comical and had none of the impact as the original flick. Helena Bonham Carter (what was she thinking) is a dead ringer for Michael Jackson which only adds to this farse of a movie. This is not even worth a rental."
4,Good variation of the original,It's a good movie with good special effects and good makeup made by wizard Rick Baker.A good remake.
1,DRECK.,"This film is complete junk. I should know better, because hollywood (it gets a small ""h"" because that is all they deserve) always does this to us. There was only one possible option with a modern version of Apes, and that was to make an exact version of Pierre Boulle's (sp?) brilliant novel, and I mean exact. The original Apes film is a masterpiece, and with the obscene amount of money they had for the budget, they could have hit a home run with the film version of the book, but instead, dreck. Cheers."
1,Waste of Time,"The most idiotic thing about this remake is that the humans were able to speak. In the original, humans had lost the ability to speak and were truly like less intelligent animals, unable to communicate in a spoken language. Needless to say, they couldn't read or write either. I guess the producers of the remake couldn't stomach the idea of a big-budget film featuring dozens of mute extras. One of the worst films of the 21st century."
1,Blu-ray Helps one of the more Realistic Apes Films,I wanted to see this movie. I went to see this movie. I wondered why I ever wanted to see this movie after I saw it. I know that blu-ray is not going to help this one. I can still see Mark Wahlberg trying to be the hero in this movie. I think he tried to do a good job but Tim Burton's direction leaves a lot to be desired. I went to see this with my son and granddaughter. It really wasn't that bad on second thought. It did seem more realistic than the original Planet of the Apes movies.
4,Wow,"This critics tore this movie apart. Why remake a classic? Well, watch the movie and you'll see. This movie was brought to date with style and maintained the integrity of the original. The action was cool and the plot was even cooler. I loved the way the movie came together. Nothing will prepare you for the end though."
3,Could have been much more,"Somewhat disappointing, the story was too filled with trite polemics concerning human and animal rights and seemed to be slanted towards an anti religious message by showing that the eschatology of the apes was simple minded and stupid (implying that modern beliefs are just as uneducated and silly). I really don't watch movies like this to get a simple minded message from the left, but I'll put up with it if the story is engaging and the plot well written, in this case it was just disappointing.Because the special effects were good and the interest level high for people that were entertained by the original series, I still found enough there for a middle rating, but only reluctantly. The dvd seemed dark and much of the dialogue hard to follow, I know there was a lot of extra material but I wasn't interested enough to view it. I'd recommend this movie as a rental for fans of the series or sci fi buffs but don't think it's worth owning."
3,"YEAH, WIERD! (ENDING SPOILER)!","As far as remakes go, PLANET OF THE APES fairs well. It's got that appealing story with great characters and exciting and stirring storytelling mixed with awesome visual effects. Mark Wahlberg proved he can take the responsibility of the lead actor. All the other performances were good, and Estella Warren is totally hot! But I just couldn't give this film four or five stars. The reason being is the surprise ending. Him getting back to Earth and finding it ruled by Simians just totally ruined the film. I'll still watch it, and my sister is going to get it from me for Christmas. Watch it if you're in the mood. If not, skip it. Watch PEARL HARBOR or the original APES films instead. At least the endings make more sense. Grade: C+"
4,HAS EVERYONE GONE BANANAS!,"I can't believe all the bad reviews. I loved the original apemovies, but I thought this updated version was also very good!The props were very good, the story was great, and I loved theway it ended! Marky Mark was good too. I bought the dvd as soonas it came out. This disc has great sound quality too!"
1,Pale imitation of a great movie,"I had high expectations for this movie. This movie really was a real dissapointment. The original was so much better on so many levels. The original was a tale of modern man, disguised by its science fiction elements. This turkey is just another mindless action movie. I can see why ""the Arnold"" was interested in making this movie first. The acting was bad, direction pedestrian, story illogical (HUGE plotholes),the ending looked like it was a band-aid attempt to fix what the movie makers knew was a bad movie. Marky Mark should go back to rapping if this is the best he can do. He has the personality of a piece of wood. The special effects were pretty good. If they had only spent as much time on the story and found an actor to replace Marky Mark."
1,Horrible,"Save yourself some time, and don't even bother watching this film. It was embarassing to its talented cast members and a waste of a potentially good storyline. The ending was absurd, and I spent the whole movie hoping it would get better. It never did, and I was greatly disappointed."
3,Tim Burton At His Worst,"I love Tim Burton's films. Edward Scissorhands, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, they're all great! But I saw this particular film and was very disappointed. It was much different than the original 60's version (but it might be more loyal to the book, which I haven't read). This movie was based mostly on fight scenes. There was plenty of action, but not much plot. I enjoyed the costumes; and Danny Elfman composed an amazing musical score, but it lacked quality in the story."
3,Planet Of The Apes,"Decent movie. Of course the originals are way better but just looking at this movie from a straight point of view, its an alright movie. Knowing the story, I didnt get lost throughout it, but I thought the story could have definately been a little more fleshed out. It seemed to just movie into subjects of the movie without much explanation. Some parts of the movie seemed like added comedy, which I dont think was neccessarily needed at all. There is quite a bit of action in this movie though which is a plus. Not really any boring parts. The acting is done quite well in my opinion. The scene at the end of the movie, the fighting scene is pretty good.Everything seems good, but then again the story should have been more fleshed out. I reccomend this movie as a rent, not really as a buy though. Its good for a watch or so but only deserves about a 3/5 rating."
2,"Some Imagination, But Leave A Classic Alone!","As some others have noted, why bother to remake this classic science fiction movie. You actually need to know the nuances of the original film to appreciate this remake. Despite that, the end [is bad]!!!! Burton went too far by trying to repeat the surprise ending of the original movie. You can't.This film clearly tried to put a new twist on the story. If you want that, read the original novel by Pierre Boulle.I give it two stars for special effects, cinematography...I can just see it now....2031 - Hollywood releases the remake of 2001 (renamed, of course) ughhhhhh!!!!!Do yourself a favor, rent this Planet..., own the original."
2,Strange and confusing,"I really didn't like this movie. For one when I movie was perfect the first time why try and go back and make it better? The characters where comical to the point of being unable to tell if the scence was supposed to be serious or not. I saw this movie in the theater and the acting confused the person next to me so much they asked me if it was supposed to be a comidy. My main point of consternation with the movie come from the ending. It absotutly made no sense. Up until that point i was ok with the movie as being something to watch and not really pay attention to but that ending ruined its status for me as just being a silly little flick. It was if they suddenly realized that the original was a serious movie and decided they should throw in something from deep thought. By all rights this movie should not be watched by someone who has seen the original, what they have done to the movie will just make you mad."
4,Where's Serling when you really need him?,Dead of course. Too bad all the good misanthropes are dead.The makeup effects are without a doubt jaw dropping.But I just didn't care.The original was a witty biting social satire. This is justan action movie. Big deal about very little.But I do admire the actors for putting up with the torment.
4,Better than expected!,"This movie was entertaining and very different from either the original movie or the book (actually it was closer to the book). The special effects were excellent as well as the make-up and the body movements of the actors.Charlton Heston makes an appearance as an ape and quotes verbatim one of his most famous lines from the original movie but it seems out of context.Possible Spoiler ahead:Not to give away the ending, but it seemed the writer tried to have it parallel Pierre Boulle's ending but it causes great confusion. You are never quite sure whether they are traveling to the future, past or to a parallel world existing in the same time continuum."
2,Well what else can you say?,I wanted to see this movie. I went to see this movie. I wondered why I ever wanted to see this movie after I saw it. I can still see Mark Wahlberg trying to be the hero in this movie. I think he tried to do a good job but Tim Burton's direction leaves a lot to be desired. It is just one big failure.
3,Should have left well enough alone,This is proof that some movies should not be remade. The only reason I gave this 3 stars instead of 2 is because of the makeup. It's impressive. Other than that the movie is a total loss. I hope they don't bother with a sequel...The REAL Planet Of The Apes movie has already been made.
3,"Burton plays it safe, Marky Mark plays it bland.","A lot of bluster arose before the unveiling of Tim Burton's ""reimagined"" version of ""The Planet of the Apes,"" to which the eccentric Burton responded by making his straightest movie ever. The apocalyptic tone drained away, the 2001 film is a by-the-book action flick, done well, but no more, with a twisteroo ending that isn't worth explaining. Mark Wahlberg is a bland human hero, while Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth steal the film as a helpful, civic-minded ape and a warlord general. Burton delivered a bombproof studio hit with few if any risks attached, instead of employing his hit-and-miss spin; in this case, the latter would have been the smarter artistic play but a financial reach."
3,Not a great effort especially from Burton!,"I really had no desire watching this whole movie the first time i saw it. Something to me about some mean apes has never really captured any of my amusement. I also wanted to see the remaking vision of Tim Burton but alas, it was a poop! The movie has a slow pace and mark walberg and the dumb blonde chick don;t really put up an out of this world menace to the apes as heston did. Instead it's a little more stylish but i felt the environment was too enclosed for some scenes showing alot of difficulty was done even to finish them! Anyways the features are decent but if you are an apes fan than I guess you have a good reason of buying this dvd!"
2,aside from the ending it's almost unwatchable,"This is the remake of the original Planet of the Apes with Charlton Heston (Heston's does a short cameo in this one). A space Air Force pilot training apes to fly space ships gets stranded in the future on a planet ruled by evolved apes. With the help of a few sympathetic apes, the pilot escapes capture and leads a rag-tag group of humans to freedom. If this terrible film has any redeeming qualities, they'd have to be the monkey costumes and the ending. The rest of the movie was [thin]: the dialogue, acting, and plot, while comparably stupid as that of the original film, fail completely to accomplish anything other than a ... rehash."
4,A new movie that should be called the next generation,"This is a movie very different than the original. First, all the humans could speak. Second, there is no scientific experiments on human as was in the original. Third, the apes acted like apes rather than semi-humans.Mark Wahlberg was not another Charlton Heston. He was much more clever and scientific. While Charlton Heston's character had a love interest, Mark Wahlberg had a human and a ape interested in him.The ending of the movie say there will be a sequel. It will be interesting to see it."
2,instantly forgettable,"yet another film where for the first couple of minutes you think, hey this looks quite good, maybe its not as terrible as everyone says.And then the plot descends to complete nonsense, and digs itself deeper and deeper into its own badly written grave.theres almost nothing which redeems it, the fact it was up against a great classic orginal and fails in almost every department, or in fact all, says it all.there were a few germs of good ideas, but the script was tosh, and most of the movie was ininvolving and laughable."
2,Good Special Effects. Terible Acting.,"It is a joke to watch the extra DVD material on how ""experts"" came in to teach the actors how to act like apes. They should have been taught how to act first. They did a great job with the male ape costumes and make up butt the females look too much like humans. And ironically the absolute worst acting besides Marky Mark is Tim Roth, the Director of this mess. This could have been a really scarey film with some of the great effects in here. But they manage to ruin it with too much corny dialogue that apparently Tim Roth thought would be clever and amusing. Instead it comes across as being predictable and stupid. Noone is going to be scared by an orangatan slave catcher played by Paul Giamati. He isn't amusing either just annoying. And the final ending makes no discernable sense from the context of this film either. Someone revoke the use of the title from these clowns before they try and ""retell"" and ruin anymore Planet of the Apes"" classics."
3,The Original is still King,"I've seen all five of the original movies, plus this one...which makes six apes movies in total, and I still love the Original one the best.Mark Wahlberg plays a pilot that has crash landed on an alien planet inhabited by talking apes. Most of the film stays true to the original, but in the end it fails.Despite it's low quality special effects, the reason the first film was so popular was because it had heart. This new version just combined lots of money and special effects, but had little heart, so it failed.With a few memorable moments including a cameo by Charleton Heston, and a surprise ending (Different from the original), the film just comes across as a decent popcorn movie, nothing else. If you want some ape action then get the original."
4,get a life!,"The criticisms on here seem to have been written by steroetypical Trekies! Apes movies, comic books, cartoons, tv shows, toys, and various merchandise are all fun, but they are also extremely absurd. Monkey Planet is an absurd novel, as is the original Apes movie which bastardized the novel. Burton's ending is much closer to the original novel's, but he still get's slammed by folks who take things way too seriously. Burton's Planet has a lot going for it and I enjoy it and the original movie and it's various follow ups. It's all fun stuff, but some people are way too uptight to just enjoy it."
2,Terriable nothing like the Original,"The movie with Charlton Heston, was ground breaking, and had a message. This one,though, is nothing but a warmed over, tossed to the side, put into the blender, with a heaping helping of Bland, and baked for 5 hours! Serve to people who are stoned,or mentally challanged!"
2,"Started out OK, then......well, not sure what happened","I recently watched this version of Planet of the Apes for the first time and I was dissapointed in a way that penguins are when they realize they are never going to fly.First, I'd like to say I love many of Tim Burton's movies (although recently...Charlie and the Chocolate Factory...not really into it). Second, I like Mark Wahlberg as an actor (HILARIOUS in I Heart Huckabees). But, this movie required you to put all logical musings aside for 2 hours in order to even get through the movie. I do realize its science fiction, but this was WAY beyond the realm of letting it slide a little bit.So, I'm going to stop short of detailing everyting I felt was flawed about this movie. In conclusion, HIGHLY dissapointed with Tim Burton on this film and IF YOU MUST: rent it. However, under no circumstances should this film be purchased.....extras on the DVD are not very good either."
1,Smells like an ape,"This movie will leave you scratching your head like a monkey. A poor attempt. I cannot understand the hype and following for Tim Burton. His work really stinks. Very visually stunning, however, as is usually the case with Tim Burton's movies (ala Sleepy Hollow)."
4,Different Perspective,"I have to agree with those that have said that, given this is merely a different perspective toward the same book, it's an excellent movie. I'm also a huge fan of the original movie series."
2,MAJOR disappointment...,"...but still a sometimes-entertaining-film. Burton is one of my favorites, but I can't recognize any of his earlier work in this. Please stay out of sci-fi, Tim - except for a sequel to MARS ATTACKS! I mean that is hilarious, man!"
2,One of the worst science fiction films ever,"Don't get me wrong, the action and effects were great, but i bought the ticket (I've only seen the original theatrical release) to see a science fiction story, one that would make you think, like good science fiction does. Plot holes were constant, and I didn't really see a point to the story. I was extremely dissapointed. If you like action and great effects (though the effects appeared only periodicaly throughout the movie, and not constantly like many moviegoers enjoy), then this is the flick for you. But if, like myself, you are looking for good science fiction, I suggest you look elsewhere."
2,Not the Original.,"This is a very bad movie it had no script and had nothing to do with the original movie at all, isn't that what remakes are all about? I feel bad for Mark Wahlberg because he is a talented and he is not getting the roles he deserves. This movie should have won the razzie for worst script. Released in 2001 it made 68 million dollars in its first week! It made 181 million dollars total. The DVD is plain and not worth it. Buy the original instead."
4,A great remake,"In 2029 an American astronaut crashes on a strange planet where the humans are ruled over by the apes. He must outrun the ape army and make it to a sacred temple that holds the truth about the past, it is also his only hope for returning home.This is a thrilling adventure. It has a great cast and very good special effects. it has drama, comedy, and action galore. Mark Wahlberg always does a great job, and Tim Burton has never made a bad movie. This movie also has a great supporting cast with Helena Bonham Carter, Kris Kristofferson, Tim Roth, Michael Clarke Duncan, Paul Giamatti, and Estella Warren. It's a loaded movie that you will never forget."
1,Huge Disappointment!,"I loved the original movies and i'm a huge fan of Mark Wahlberg. When I found out about this movie I wanted to watch it immediately! I was instantly disappointed... In this movie, the humans in the future can talk and are intelligent, which creates even more inconsistencies than there were in the original movies! The directing is bad and i would say the apes looked better in the originals. I feel they had a great opportunity to make a huge movie, but they completely blew it! Horrible film!"
1,Not for fans of the series,"I have to repeat what one reviewer wrote because it sums it all up perfectly:""Take everything that made the original good (arguments against war, religion, military, corrupt political system), now flush that all down the toilet."" Well put.I own/have seen/have read practically everything POTA. This was just bad. A missed opportunity to re-imagine the original. I was further shocked by the director's commentary - Hey Mr. Burton, thanks for not pointing most of the homages to the original such as Linda Harrison's cameo! Also, some of the special features on the DVD were shocking - did none of the people in the film even know anything about the original film or even a little bit about the series itself? They all came across as self-absorbed idiots who didn't know or care about what they were working on.A very sad, missed opportunity. What were they thinking?"
2,There is little redeeming about this movie,"It's amazing how half-hearted this movie is. The scenes, costumes, and especially the dialogue are all worse than the original. If this wasn't a remake, the first whole hour you'd be asking yourself ""why did they make this movie?"". The whole movie is lazy and doesn't bother to explain itself or create any real drama, but just strolls thru a dull plot. The only interesting points are when the monkey comes back in the pod and of course the ending on earth. Otherwise, there are prosaic discussions, escapes, and battles that make up the rest of the movie. Pathetic effort."
1,"Not If You Paid Me, Tim........","When(If) I meet God at the gates, and if he grants me one last wish, it will be for me to choke Tim Burton for 2+ hours, effectively paying him back for the 2+ hrs of my life I'll never have back after watching this sad excuse for a movie. Apes, huh? Well, I think I saw better actors at my local zoo. All in all, a truly wretched movie-going experience. Too sum up - I wouldn't take this movie/DVD for free, even to go pawn it - I would be too ashamed....by the way, this wouldn't let me enter ZERO stars and I would surely give a Negative Rating......."
4,Waiting for part 2?,An excellent remake of the original Planetof the apes.An outstanding performance byMark Wahlberg and Tim Roth.They left this movie open for a part 2.I am asuming the second one will be theremake of Escape from the Planet of the apes.It's been a couple year's since they have notmade part 2 of this movie.When will we eversee the new version of Escape from the planetof the apes.You can't just end a movie and leaveit open for a part 2.Hopefully we will see part 2in 2004 or in 2005.Although alot of people like the originalPlanet of the apes better than the remake.The remake is a must own for every fan.I think it's better because the specialeffect's are better.Of course they didn'thave special effect's like this back then.It's still very entertaing with lot's of action.This is a must own dvd to add to your Planetof the apes collection.
1,Verry Boring FIlm + 30 Hours of more Boring Video behind this film.,"I was expect alot when i seen the traier saying is the dvd at that time for the feature they got, i just said that's probably the best part of the movie is too see u get alot of feautre(but almsot of all of them are boring) The movie was even worst, plot is so lame, was sound exciting at first but once meet with the ape is like a story plot and acting fall like a river, avoid this at all cost! u will be big dissapoting when u see this film, watch the original not this one."
1,NEW FORMULA DIDN'T HELP COCA-COLA EITHER!,"Mr. Wahlberg is always fun to watch. Mrs. Carter has the acting skills of bottom feeder. You can't put Mr. Kristofferson into a movie, after ""Blade"", as a wimp and then kill him off in a flash. Oh! and let's not forget that the humans didn't talk in the 1st movie!! what's the matter? lack of substance! Mr. Heston's performance was embarassing. this truly put a smudge in my mind against all his old greats. Our lead ape, no offense to Jacko, looked like Michael Jackson. the most disturbing scene was that threesome kiss scene...you know? man kisses ape. pauses for effect. man kisses woman who can't act....ah, the old days. the only two things worth giving this film 1 star is the forshadowing scene at the end, that thrilled me more than the entire movie! and Tim Roth's performance was great. Alas, I think Mr. Burton is riding on fumes."
1,Not worth the time,"The trailers sold this as an action film. However, it is far from exciting. The escape from captivitiy scene is nothing more than some guys in ape make-up climbing walls while Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch run back and forth across the screen with No One In Pursuit. This film is really rather dull and not worth the time or money. Its plot line drags and is nothing more than an excuse to show how far make-up effects have come since the original film."
4,Never go by the Critics......,"that's what I always say. The remake of Planet of the Apes was good. Mark Wahlberg did a really good job, Helena Bonham and Tim Roth were terrific. So what did everyone expect? You had a good looking astronaut, a cute ape with a crush on him. A sexy blonde, an evil ape and a humorous ape named Limbo. It had something for everyone."
2,No more monkey business!!,"Why does Hollywood always re-make good movies? If, it ain't broken, don't fix it. Planet of the Apes is a good example. If there were never an original, than this would get a higher rating. But there was, and this is nowhere close to as good. If you've never seen the original you'll probably like it. If you have seen the original, don't monkey around with this."
1,This was a very bad movie,"Today all movie studios need is a couple above average looking young people, some cheesy special-effects and they have a huge blockbuster. Who the hell needs acting and a story right? WRONG!Look at the classic film Planet of the Apes and you will see a very good film questioning our society. Tim Burton just dosent get it. The '68 classic was a political film. It was not just a brainless sci-fi flick. It challenged the human race's way of living in violence and fear of others different then them. This is just some make-shift attempt at a summer blockbuster."
1,Too awful for words,I have to say that this is one of the worst things I've ever seen in my life. The best thing about it was the music playing as the credits rolled!
1,sickening,"i liked tim burton, i liked the original, but this made me sick. it was bad to the point that i thought at first it was a joke. how could tim burton, the guy who did batman, be doing this to me? it was not a joke. at least not intentionally. people were leaving the theatre. i had honestly never seen that before. overacted, way overacted, and in a very bad way. the story was ridiculous. i felt bad for the quality actors who were in it. (...)"
5,I love TIME TRAVEL !!!,"One of the best, well-made, excellent, well-done sci fi movies in the whole universe. Watch it after you watch the first one made in 1968.Scary thought. Excellent movie. Highly recommended."
2,Planet of the Numb skulls,How could a great director like Tim Burton take a concept that is slam dunk good and change it so much as to kill it this bad. While it does have some good points most of this mess is just wrong. Allowing the humans to talk makes the hunting of them more cruel than in the first films when men were seen as cattle and pest. Talking humans did in the series and this movie as well. The apes come across as just cruel hunting and killing speaking animals and this sinks this turkey fast. A real let down and waste of time
4,one of the best for this genre,"made with that blue black atmosphere of comic book stories the past 10-15 years this is one of the best in my opinion ... the story progresses smoothly without the schlock of the original and the bull in china shop action of Charlton Heston. This (4 stars) is a good one to buy with the Rise of The Planet of the Apes (5 stars), which in my opinion is the best of the entire collection."
1,Planet of the Apes,"Great make-up effects is all this abysmal remake had going for it, this is the case with most of Tim Burton's movies, always visually appealing with mediocre to no plot, it's like a cycle."
1,Tim Burton caved!,"The plot is replete with big gaping, yawning, cavernous holes. Why? Burton cut the heart out of his movie. This movie was supposed to be a tender love story between the ape, Ari, and the astronaut. In the original director's cut, shown to focus groups, the most important theme of the movie was the competition for his affection between the human female and the ape female. Apparently the test audiences were especially grossed out when the ape and human were passionately swapping spit. The studio forced Burton to cut out all of that interspecies sex stuff... and with it the motivation for most of Ari's actions. I'm not saying that the ending in the uncut version was any less inane than the version that was released. However, when Burton caved and the marketing managers prevailed, the audience was left with complete dreck."
3,"Dissapointimg, but OK","I love the original ""Planet of the Apes"", and after watching the trailers i felt like it was going to be a great film, since the beginning scenes, the film looked very cool, the ""ape suite"" scene, but then it started to slow down, and i truly did not like the film a lot, though i was interested in what happened, but the character development i didn't liked it, Tim Roth looked scary and everything in some scenes, but i tried to hate him, but i didn't quite did it, i liked the music, and i liked a bit the movie, but i find it dissapointing, but it's okay, maybe renting it on DVD will make me understanding it and liked it more (that happened to me with ""Cast Away"")"
4,One of his best studio albums,"It's a toss-up between Fats' first and last ABC-Paramount albums (""Here Comes Fats Domino"" and ""The Best Of Fats Domino"", respectively) but this 1968 effort produced by Richard Perry, despite some wrongheaded overproduction and the inclusion of a weak Beatles' cover of ""Lovely Rita"", had ""Grammy"" written all over it. ""Honest Papas..."" and ""One For The Highway"" are two of his greatest cuts; ""Make Me Belong To You"" is a mid-tempo sentimental classic, released on 45rpm and sadly ignored.""Wait Till It Happens To You"" is a recut of an earlier recording for Broadmoor and this is another excellent example of New Orleans-based triplet arranging.Above I mentioned ABC-Paramount and that's the label that originally issued Fats' ""There Goes My Heart Again"", most recently issued on CD as ""The Paramount Years"". Good luck, contributor from Donabate!"
3,"Looking for a song called ""There Goes My Heart""","I am looking for a recording of ""There Goes My Heart"" and it goes something like this There Goes My Heart, There goes the one I love, there goes the girl I am not worthy of, there goes my everthing it couldn't be, there goes somebody else instead of me. Good bye romance - I knew it could'nt last......etc....I think it was recorded by Fats Domino. Any further information would help. Many thanks"
5,A captivating novel with timeless appeal.,"Muireall Donald has accomplished what every writer hopes to achieve. Using one of the 17th century Scotland's most brutal massacres, she takes the soul of the Scot and bares it for us in a tale of love that transports us back in time. Skillfully woven into this compelling love story is political intrigue and a realistic view of life during a time when the Scottish Highlanders were struggling to maintain their clan against an increasingly hostile reign. Ms. Donald creates characters with depth and dimension. Her words paint a picture so real that the reader feels a part of the story rather than a passive bystander. This is a book for everyone. It's certainly a book that will have you searching the racks for the next offering by this talented writer."
5,Beautifullly Written.,"Ms. Donald's unique style and attention to detail bring alive this tale spun from Scotish history capturing not only your imagination but your heart as well. She incorporates a well balanced mix of history, myth, romance, and adventure sure to lift any reader's spirits. This is a book worth reading."
2,Trite and trying.,"Did someone say this is ""serious literature""? Are we reading the same book? Tedious literature is more like it, with cardboard characters and a formula plot. I had to force myself to finish it just so I could post this review. If you trailed here from Dorothy Dunnett's page, turn back, turn back! 'Tis a deadend."
3,It Was OK,"The book contained some valuable information such as the proper use and role of vitamins and hair, skin, and nail health. However, her section on what skin routine to use was stupid at times. It went as the following: ""i dont know exactly what soap you should buy, because i love my skin too much to test any other ones out..."" But to give her credit, she did list out POSSIBLE skin regimines (even though she never personally tested them out). All in all I feel like her book wasnt anything new (considering it was written in the 70s, i expected that) but the info within was invaluable. I would say if you want a definite regemin to follow: then read this book. However, if you want to spare the money, just do what youve always known for beauty: eat plenty fruits and veggies, less processed foods, take a daily multivitamin, drink plenty water, and eat plenty protein from healthy preferably sugar-free and organic sources."
1,This Sucks!,I am also a huge Seagal fan and rented this one. I also don't understand why they dub his voice. If they didn't dub his voice I would have much more respect for him.
1,Attack Farce,"I just saw this movie, and in the very beginning, I hear Segal's charecter saying some lines which led me to believe there was going to be a sinister body double that was plotting against the good guy Segal. I was shocked to realize that it was actually a voice dub! I thought to myself, why would they voice over his original dialog, and why would they use another actor instead of having Segal do it. Then I looked up the movie on Wikipedia and found out that there were script changes made after the movie was shot and the voice overs were made to compensate! What a joke. This movie sucks ass. Steven, I think you need to go back to China or Japan or wherever you went to get your inspiration and meet up with your master again, or maybe go to a retreat in the Caribeaan and go on a macro-biotic diet for a few months!"
1,A Giant Wild Free-Ranging TURKEY!!!,This is indisputably one of the biggest TURKEYS ever made. Horrible! A lot of Seagal's voice is dubbed in by another actor and is very disruptive and laughable. Seagal phoned into his performance from the other side of the world. I've already spent too much of my valuable time writing about this complete waste of film.
1,Possibly the worst movie I have EVER seen,"Add my disappointment to that of the others posted here. Bad dubbing, poor quality film and even wounds that jump from one side to the other(in the late fight scene between Seagal and one of the druggie women, he slashes her down the left side of her chest, then the scene jumps and the wound is on the right side, then back again in next cut...pathetic! Stephen looks old and chubby and needs a facial...I'll go back to the 'old' movies...love those old Seagal movies. He needs to retire...and work out.Doc"
1,Don't bother,"What can I say?I would've been disappointed if I'd only rented this DVD, let alone bought it. Like the other reviewers, i too have been a seagal fan since Above the Law. His movies have been going down hill recently - but there have at least been some saving qualities amongst them! Attack force is pure unadulterated insidious crap. If you haven't stuck cutlery (or any convenient household utensil) into your ears by the half way point, there's something wrong with you. The voice dubbing is pathetic. A female voice with an indian accent would sound closer to Mr Seagal's own voice than the gravelly whisp that emanated from his mouth for most of the dialogue.Maybe that's the movie's saving grace: you can't turn away - if you do, you won't know who's talking!"
1,wow.,"Why doesn't Amazon have negative stars? This one would get a -5. Words do not decribe how horrible this movie was. I feel dumber for having watched this. Exactly one hour, 34 minutes of my life that I will never get back."
1,"A poorly done movie, not worthy of Seagal","I've been a longtime fan of Seagal's movies, but I was greatly disappointed by this film. First, there were clearly sections where Steven Seagal's voice was done by a different actor who sounds nothing like him. (Clearly done when the film was cut together after the main filming) It was surprising that they could not take the time to get Seagal to do the vocal tracks for those sections. There were also very few action sequences that demonstrated Seagal's skills with martial arts. In many ways, this film was more of a slasher flick than an action film. Little action, but lots of bloody corpses lying about. I enjoyed Black Dawn far more, and feel it was a much better made film."
1,"Waste of Time, Money, DVD Plastic, Waiting In Line, Script","I totally agree with all of the others. This Seagal movie was a total waste of anything consumed to produce or effort to buy it. It is one of those films (can not really be called a movie)that they would have to pay me a lot of money to sit thru and watch it. Deemed so bad, it could be classed as inhumane to use on POWs. So far off the mark, I am shocked he would put his name (let alone act) on it. So far from the Under Siege 1 and 2, I would be ashamed to claim I purchased it, let alone watched this over dubbed, darkly shot, plottless film."
1,Disapointed,Im A huge Seagal fan to i was so disapointed watching attack force i was looking forward to watching it as i stared watching it and and thrught was going on here thats not his voice i just hope the girlfriend didnt catch on cos she never seen the seagal movie i suggest to watch this as it was a new one i was so wrong showing her was shocking what are you doing steven? please do something about this cos you have nearlly lost me as a fan if you keep relsasing b grage movie
1,"Unbelievable, I'm glad I didn't buy it.","Steven Seagal needs to preview his new films before releasing them. The script was unbelievable. In one Segal was speaking but it wasn't his voice. Steven, I believe it's time to retire. Over weight too much black hair die."
1,AVOID,"I've never written a review before, but this movie was so bad I had to! Don't read anymore about this movie, just save the 1.5 hours of your life by watching anything else."
1,Boring,"This is the worst Steven Seagal movie ever. Story has been done before, create a super human soldier, and better. Looks like post production dubbed over Steven Seagal's voice numerous times."
1,Worse than trash,"If this is from Sony Pictures, I have to question the quality of every other Sony product. This is the worst picture ever made, period. I'll never buy another Seagal movie."
1,Worst movie ever...voice sounds like he has cancer!,"This was the worst Seagal movie ever made...It was confusing, dark, stupid plot and they made his voice sound like the Marlboro man with cancer. I used to love his movies but if this is the stuff he is now making he is all washed up. He fights like a old man in the movie too...DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY...Too Bad...he used to be great!"
3,Not the worst Seagal movie I've ever seen.,"Right up there with other former box office superstars such as Van Damme, Norris, Lungren and Snipes. It would seem that one can make more money producing STV movies with good production instead of waiting for a theater release that might never come again.Other than the obvious dubbing of Seagals voice, this wasn't any better or worse then most Seagal movies.I wouldn't mind seeing more gratuitous nudity or even meaningless sex in his movies, but I'll take what I can from Seagal.One more thing, the singing thing isn't working...........stick to movies."
1,And I thought Patriot was bad,"Remember Seagal's movie ""Patriot"" where he saves the day with flower petals dropped from a plane. That was bad. This one was by far the worst movie he has ever made. With the dubbed in voice (Why?) to the disjointed plot it should never have been released."
1,Attack Force,"The worse Steven Seagal I have tried to watch. I have every one of his movies, have put up with loose shirts, etc. but dubbing his voice really agravated me. He has a destintive voice and when it is dubbed you know it. This doesn't even deserve a 1 star."
2,The old LSD in the water supply...,"It appears Steven Seagal's formula action movie isn't very popular.Designer drugs that alter DNA and make monsters out of the peopleare fought here by a special commando team. The government turns on theteam and the drug experimenters put the results of their experimentsin the water supply.In the end there is a very bloody fight with knives...and the government again backs the team, while the Green Hornet and Katoescape."
5,One of the Most Satisfying Pieces of Music Ever,"My CD collection is in the tens of thousands. Most of the music I own has its moments in the sun, and that's it. But since it's release in 1988, The Indescribable Wow has seldom been away from my turntable for long. I'm 51 years old, and seek out new music daily, which I've done since I was about 9. But rain or shine, The Indescribable Wow continues to be fun and adventurous to listen to."
4,Very good,Very good stuff!Arrived within the specified time and very well packaged.I really liked the sound and retro style of Dan Echo.
1,Great Echo Sound But......,"The Danelectro pedal is probably the best echo you can find out there. The only thing is, its expensive and it breaks really fast. I have owned two pedals now and the inputs break because they are made out of plastic."
2,I had to buy this for a class,"This one of those books that you hate to buy for any class. Not only was it one of the most tedious reads, but you could fake having read it just based on the class discussion. My advice, if you have to buy this for a class do so with a couple of other people, divide the chapters and then summarize them to each other. Otherwise be prepared for a tedious evening."
2,not what I expected,"This author makes learning color way too complicated for my tastes. As an artist and an art teacher I bought this book on the recommendation of an art student, but was very disappointed. As a plein air painter I believe in letting nature be your teacher and learning to observe color. These color schemes seem very arbitrary and formulaic."
1,Great card... 4 years ago.,"Geezus, where did they find this one? Diamond isn't even an independent company anymore. The Viper V770 Ultra was based off of the nVidia Riva TNT Ultra chipset, this chipset was used before the original GeForce came out. They are now way beyond this chipset. I don't know any reason why anyone would want to buy this very old card."
1,Good card in '99: no longer supported,"I had a Viper V770 (non ultra) put in my machine when it was built in 1999. It was a good card then. Diamond sold it's graphics card devision, and this card has no factory support for windows XP. Only generic TNT2 chipset drivers are available for XP."
4,Awsome Upgrade,"This video card kicks ass, but if you currently have a VooDoo2 card its not worth $250. I suggest playing new games like Kingpin or Q3 test to get the full 32-bit color experance."
3,"Great Video Card, But One Major Problem","This is an excellent video card, and it is so much better than a Voodoo. The graphics are amazing, and its a decent buy. There is one seroius problem to consider though: NO TV OUT. I love this card, but I got DVD drive, and I can't watch DVD movies on my TV. My monitor is small, so I don't like watching movies on it, and now I have to buy and decoder card...I really wish this card had TV out because it would be the greatest card, and I would have gave it 5 stars. Before you buy this card think about this: Do I want to watch DVD movies on my TV, using TV OUT, or want to watch it on my monitor? Remeber if you want to watch DVDs on your TV, you will need to spend extra $$ for a Decoder Card."
4,This is an excellent card.,"This is a very very good card. IT is fast, provides excellent Direct 3d and open GL support. The only drawback with this card is that Voodoo3 supports higher frame-rates. BUT...here is a tip: put this card in with two voodoo2 cards in an SLI config, this will give you the best gaming rig around."
2,Slower than Voodoo3 2000 and most expensive !!!,"All you gyes that bought this card made a BIG mistake. BIG around $100 :-(.WHY ? This board does not support GLIDE. Now some gyes will replay - None of the newest games support GLIDE, and they will be WRONG. WHY ? Because there's a thing called Voodoo Open GL, and this thing enables the GLIDE support for all OpenGL games (most of the games supports OpenGL - Quake, Unreal, KingPin, Half-Life ...). I personaly made some tests and I can tell you - under Voodoo Open GL, Voodoo 3 is much faster than TNT2 Ultra (10-frames faster).Hey gyes, but TNT2Ultra costs $200 copmared to Voodoo3 2000 which costs $100.About 32-bit colors rendering - I've looked on some KingPin's screenshots on TNT2 and on Voodoo3 and they looked exactly the same (but under Voodoo3's OpenGL KingPin worked with 10-frames higher than TNT2Ultra).Conclusion : Voodoo still rules!!!!!!!"
2,Great concept but...,I liked the idea of not having to grind before I go out into the back country. With this product I was excited to grind for myself and friends while we were enjoying the sunrise. On the second trip the wing nut had stripped out on it not allowing me to set the grind the way we liked it. On the third trip it was completely useless. I think I will continue to pre-grind until I find something a little more sturdy
1,poor quality!,"Ridiculous! I've received three of these grinders, and all were broken. The first: the box was undamaged, but the grinder had clearly been dropped with a huge crack, and packaged like that. The second: the crank wouldn't come off or budge. My boyfriend and I spent a week fiddling with it to no avail. The third appeared okay upon arrival, but within a week of use, the threading wore out and it just dropped out whole beans! And oh boy, a brand new coffee grinder breaking in the middle of a work week in the wilderness is just bad news.The instructions are laughable. There are no words. Sure, most people can figure it out without them, but old people still exist and I found myself wondering if I was doing something wrong when the crank wouldn't budge.And GSI, whose ""real person"" customer service they boast on their website, never answered my email/questions.I don't know what the deal with this product is, but they need to get it together."
4,Nice,"Works very well, especially when used with GSI's own press pots (they are designed to fit together). All I would have liked to see change is a slightly tighter seal so that coffee stored in the grinder's very convenient storage space could be air tight. So, other than not being able to keep beans inside the grinder space for more than a week, this grinder has worked out very well for me."
1,Bad product,"I bought this item thinking that it would be a great option for those of us that try to be ""green"". I am trying to stay away from electrical appliances. Unfortunately, it only took two mornings of coffee-making for this thing to break. I am very dissapointed. I am returning it as soon as I find a box to send it back."
4,"solid grinder - we use this at home, camping, at sea","We don't have an electric grinder and use this as our primary grinder when at home, when camping or when at sea. Having used this model daily (multiple times daily - two of us drinking a lot of coffee) for nearly 3 years we have found that the weak point is the knob at the end of the crank. If you are cranking the grinder using your right hand, your thumb will be on the spot that wears out after approximately 1 year. Not a big deal and the unit can be used without the rubber knob. We bought several more just because we like it so much and like to share."
1,What they didn't tell you,"I purchased this card, mainly for price and lack of research. I plugged it in. It does do well for video, for high resolution display, but it cannot deal with 2D games. It butcherizes them...I mean bad. In fact, one game would't play untill I went back to the old 4mb Vcard. The games it did poorly with were Axis and Allies,and Army Men 2. My son won't let me put it back. Anyone want this card cheap? When you upgrade card it shouldn't fail on older software."
2,Keep looking,"If you care about video performance, keep on looking. This card is not gonna be the best for today's advanced games. Go with a Voodoo3 or a TNT2, those will keep you ""up-to-date"" for a while."
4,Great card at an affordable price,"I just bougth this card and I can tell you it performs great with my favorite games (Unreal, Episode I Racer) an it's unexpensive. great buy."
3,A gentle story,"You trust that Lynne Hinton isn't going to take you to an awful place and then leave you there and she does not.Hinton tells a gentle story, a difficult story, but you know that, in the end, all things will work together for good, and they do."
2,Dull,"I tried to be into this book. It started off okay, but became dull quickly. I kept waiting for something to happen and was disappointed. Sadly, I didn't even finish the book. I just couldn't stay interested."
3,"Quick and right, but cracked","The product I was expecting arrived quickly in the mail. It worked fine, but I was disappointed to find that the case and the paper cover were both cracked and ripped. It would've been good to know about these defects beforehand."
2,fell apart the first day I wore them,"Loved them the minute they arrived, but stupidly threw out the box. The strap in the back tore the first day I wore them..can't return without box...spending $ for shoe repair...very disappointed with quality."
4,Rio PMP300 Headphone Remote,"When i first saw it i thought what have i bought? Then as i started to use it i started to realize how cool it was. I am just a newcomer to MP3's but i know a fair amount so when i saw an easier way to control my amazing rio 300 i went straight for it. It is so easy to use and simple that you wonder why you did not buy it in the first place. It is easy to understand how to use it, it is clear and quick. What else can you ask for? Well i think if you work out a lot and wish for an easier way to choose your favourite songs then you SHOULD buy the Rio headphone remote."
1,Complete Disaster,I should have known from the inexpensive price that this product was heading for the garbage. From the first day I bought it all it did was worsen the sound and slow down my mp3's. The buttons on this quiet too large headphone remote are hard to follow and I had trouble figuring out many of them. This large piece of equipment is too big for Diamond Rio and adds uneccessary bulk.
5,Less Than Zero,If you were in high school in the 80's you had to have seen this movie! I saw it in the theater 3 times & had to have it for our personal collection. Great movie!
4,"Good movie, bad adaptation.","Let me say first that this movie, in and of itself, is a very good eighties film. However, it is nothing compared to the book, and it is also NOTHING like the book except for the fact that everyone's doing coke, and there are generally the same names for the characters. Also, in the book, Clay is doing just as much horse as everyone else, while in the movie, he is totally against it. Most of the scenarios in the movie are not present in the book at all. There is no tension between Clay and Julian over the girl, only one involving money. So if you just want a great movie to watch, this is it, but if you're an Ellis fan looking to watch a decent adaptation of your favourite book, this certainly won't do."
3,(***1/2 stars out of *****) Flawed but quite compelling,"This movie tested quite badly with critics and audiences back in 1987 and that is too bad. The characters are quite interesting and involving, the situations are credible, the pacing is good, and director Kanievska pays strong attention to detail and creating a dark, gritty, disturbing atmosphere. A well-made film, plain and simple."
1,Read the book instead!,"One of the most dreadful, terrible, awful, horrid, wretched pieces of garbage I have ever watched. I must have blocked out Weekend at Bernie's & Mannequin- it's the only excuse I can give for forgotting how terrible of an actor Andrew McCarthy is. Robert Downey Jr. & James Spader were the only reasons I was able to stomach this inaccurate piece of tripe. The storyline consists of decadent, beautiful cokeheads who sit around being beautiful until Andrew McCarthy comes home to save everyone! Oh yippee! Let's take the storyline of the book and completely disregard it!While the book has its flaws, it never once portrays anyone as perfect - including Clay, who somehow turns into the victim in the movie. The movie is a bunch of fluff with anti-drug messages sandwiched in between. If that's your thing, knock yourself out."
2,Lame,"Based on a somewhat uninteresting novel, what we have here is a boring film about So Cal kids on coke in the 80s. It hasn't held up. Only Robert Downey Jr. shows a spark of acting ability, along with James Spader. Andrew McCarthy and Jami Gertz are just awful. Every adult is portrayed as a one dimensional stereotype. You won't learn anything here, except how awful were film adaptations of 80s novels. Of course, the dopers here went on to imitate their art in real life."
2,After School Not-So-Special,"This movie took out everything that was urgent and disturbing about the book and then gloosed it over into a Paula Abdul video minus MC Skat Cat but adding a few drug scences. The acting is petrified wooden and the characters, who shouldn't have any morels like in the book, seem to be there to move the plot along instead of actually making you care about their fates. Read the book; it's much more nilhilistic."
2,bah!,"i consider ""less than zero"" unfilmable in the sense that the novel was so emotionally powerful/well written for me that no film could live up to it. however, i did have actually a lot of hope for this film. i wanted to enjoy it. but what we have here is an excercise in pointlessness, more bumbiling than one can even imagine. i guess the film's purpose is to show:A. the powers of drug addiction on peopleB. the emptiness of our culture.but what i actually got out of this was:A. the powers of drug addiction as portrayed through horrible diolougeB. the emptiness of our culture through monotinous scenesbut all is not lost. Robert Downey Jr.'s performance is actually quite good, however most of the rest of the film is, as i said previously, monotinous and bumbiling."
3,okay,"The sex scenes, although without nudity, are quite blatant, and the inclusion of some of the drug-abuse scenes seems gratuitous. The story itself feels not as original nowadays, and could be more developed; it would have helped if its themes/issues were explored in even greater depths. I haven't read the book on which the film is based, so I won't compare the two.The main characters, Julian (Robert Downey Junior), Blair (Jami Gertz), and Clay (Andrew McCarthy), are well portrayed. For instance, Clay uses his fingers to feel for Julian's pulse--a rather clinical act compared to how Blair presses her ear against Julian's chest. The film's soundtrack, including ""Hazy Shade of Winter"" by the Bangles used in the opening credits and ""Life Fades Away"" by Roy Orbison in the end credits, is befitting of the story."
2,Read The Book/ Buy The Soundtrack,"Well, I bought this movie excepting a plot. At the end of the movie I waited for more story line, and received nothing. I just wanted to say RENT IT do not buy it like me. I'll probably let it collect dust in my vhs cabinet. The music is great; Roy Orbison singing a Glenn Danzig song, Slayer playing In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, Danzig singing 50's music. Buy the CD, but if you watch the movie you'll notice the songs should have been placed in later more important parts."
1,WORSE THAN BAD,"It's unfortunate that I can't give this film ""less than 1"" star. I remember seeing it in 1987 when it came out and was furious that I shelled out money to see this mess. I thought that a viewing on video 12 years later might help me appreciate it but it did'nt. The problems begin with a warped, unrealistic look at ""life in the fast lane"" 80's style and continue with insipid performances by Andrew McCarthy and (especially) Jami Gertz (what happened to her anyway ???). Most of the publicity surrounded Robert Downey Jr's performance, which for a time was considered brilliant. Now we know he was merely playing himself, which makes his character Julian all the more pathetic. Only James Spader, as Rip (and where did that name come from??)is suitably effective..although he looks far too young for the part."
1,total blank,"quite dreadful. Easton Ellis's book brings to light a general malaise in wealthy young America. the film takes all the venom out of the book, by pouring drugs, homosexuality, depression, prostitution into the character of 'troubled' Julian. society is okay, says the film, in direct contradiction to the book, it's just this poor misguided individual Julian who's in trouble, but with the help of supportive friends, even he may be able to pull through. dark, moody shots and a 'modern' soundtrack can't make up for the fact that this piece of film-making is an act of subversion, but what it is subverting is the subversive quality of the book it is based on. should never have been made."
4,Too scared to do drugs,"I first saw this movies as an 18 year old when it came out in Australia in 1987. I initially thought it would be one of those 80's love stories with a bit of the usual soft drug use and cheesy laughs that were the staple of the time.In reflection I now know what a mistake that was.The drug useage , prostitution and evil consequences made me WAY sure that I wasnt doing any of that and the DONT DO DRUGS message of the times worked for me.What amazes me is that Robert Downey Jr after making this film actually did develop a well documented drug habit etc.Great film, should be shown to all 15-18 year olds just to let them know what can and probably does happen when you play the game and get caught up in it."
3,"Initially promising, but overall...a wasted opportunity","About three weeks ago I rented ""The Pick-up Artist"" and saw a preview for ""Less Than Zero"". Being a huge fan of dark, nihilistic dramas, I immediately checked out a copy. The somber tone of opening scenes made for a first-rate beginning-----I was hooked. Unfortunately, after about 40 minutes into it, the movie was just spinning its wheels, suffocating the brilliance of the first act with a mediocre plot. I intend to read the book to see if it is any better."
5,Glamorous and Gritty,Wow...like a time warp to the late 80's..!When I saw this flick for the first time (about 10 years ago) I thought that it overly glamorized drug-use...this time when I saw it (on the fabulous DVD Transfer!) I thought it was really pretty sad. Especially the way the parents interacted with the kids.GREAT in the 80's...GREAT NOW...for very different reasons.
5,"Great title, Great movie.","Less Than ZeroI've heard of this movie for years & I finally got it! It's a sad & intense tale of someone who ""marches to the beat of their own drum"" (while strung out on drugs & alcohol) without checking his bearings or vision with others (a.k.a. self-deluded) & ultimately becomes the cause of his own demise. There are enabling individuals who help him on his way too. Strongly reminds me of the ""Very Draining People"" chapter in the book, ""Ordering Your Private World""."
2,Less Than Zero,"I remembered why I loved this movie as a teen growing up in the 80s. The music, the wardrobe, and McCarthy, Gertz, Spader, and Downey, Jr. were some of my favorite actors during this period. While watching the film now as an adult, I can see the flaws in the dialogue and direction - some of the scenes played like music videos - but the acting, especially by Downey, Jr. was actually pretty good. Gertz is quite believable as the snobby, ""I can quit anytime I want to"" coke queen, Blair and McCarthy displays his charm as Mr. Nice Guy, Clay, but it's really Downey, Jr. as the drugged out Julian who's the real presence in this film. Downey's Julian is spot on as the guy who's down on his luck and can't catch a break so he resorts to drugs to mask the pain of life and the pain of losing his friend, Clay, to a successful college career. Spader's drug dealer, Rip, is fun to watch as well."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS I REMEMBERED!,"I give this film credit for not being just another ""80's teen"" movie. This film is not a comedy and is really a downer. The likable cast is very familiar,as we have seen them many times before in light ""high school 80's"" comedies. James Spader who normally plays a snobby rich kid(at least back in those days) portrays a cold hearted drug dealer and Robert Downey Jr. portrays a kid with a serious freebase or crack addition(sounds like his real life) who gets into a big debt with the drug dealing Spader. The performances are OK. but Downey has the best performance in this flick by far. The DVD transfer looks pretty good and there are some trailers for the film."
2,What a crappy adaptation,"Don't watch this movie expecting to see Bret Easton Ellis's ""Less than zero,"" it is far from that. The similarities between the book are as follows: They have the same names, and they do drugs (but not even as much as they do in the book). They leave out a lot of important stuff from the book. With this movie the notion that the movie is never as good as the book, is definately 100% true.Had I not read the book prior to watching this movie, I may have liked it a little more. However the movie still isn't that great. My suggestion: pick up a copy of Bret Easton Ellis's version at a bookstore instead!"
2,"More than zero, but not by much","Two friends (Andrew McCarthy and Jami Gertz) try to rescue a third (Robert Downey, Jr.) from the cocaine-fueled hell into which he is spiraling in the glitzy LA drug scene of the 80s. Although I admired the performances (particularly Downey's), I just couldn't get very involved in the story and look of the film was too slick. It often seemed as if director Marek Kanievska really wanted to make a music video. One could argue that this look is appropriate for the superficial world that the characters inhabit, but that doesn't make me enjoy it any more. It is filled with absurd MTV moments like the two young lovers stopping their car right in the middle of the road and making out passionately while bikers rumble past on either side of them. And the fate of Downey's character is uninspired and cliche."
2,Disappointing adaptation of the novel by Brett Easton Ellis,"A pale imitation of the book, which takes vast liberties with the plot. I mean-- for heaven's sake, none of the leads are even blonde! However, if you can get past the watered down story, it makes for a mildly entertaining tale of poor little rich kids in L.A. Better yet, save your money and read the book (which is vastly superior)."
3,"Great sentences, so-so book","When I started reading this book I thought I had a real winner. Pryor's sentences are awesome--full of creative metaphor and unique use of language. The problem was that after while, all the great sentences, one after another, started to seem long and stilted. Don't get me wrong, there are some well-thought plot twists and pretty hilarious characters (a transsexual assassin working for Saddam Hussein!?), but unfortunately the writing style gets in the way of plot and character development. I found myself skimming the paragraphs trying to get the gist of the plot and move on. This is too bad, because some of those passages were probably worth reading. Too much of a good thing, maybe?"
2,I've seen better,"Well I originally just wanted to get the Jump Around single. But everywhere I turned to look it was out of stock.So what I did was I went here to amazon.com for the first time. After reading that review by the one guy I was all exited. So I bought the CDThe remixes stunk (especially number three, I can't imagine what that guy was thinkin) but at least I got the original. Now if you are reading this don't be fooled by that guy's review. Your better off getting the album or hunting down the single but please don't get this!I rated it two stars becuase even though I didn't like the remixes I was glad I finally got the original. And hopefully you will learn from my mistakes."
1,Disgusting,The three remixes featured along with the original version are the epitimy of butchering a classic. Im am so glad that they had samples on this site cause I would have been kicking myself if I bought this CD. The original verion of Jump around was great but the mixes on this cd mad me wanna stick sharpened pancils in my ears. DO NOT WASTE ANY MONEY ON THIS CD!
5,I'M SPEACHLESS,"Anyone who likes great dance music with an Irish twist will LOVE this album. It's a must for anybody, actually.*****'s is what I say. The sound of the music is beautiful, just absolutely equisite. I'm more of a alternative kinda of guy, and I thought it was great! If you live in Boston, all the better because thats what your friends are probably listening to. Plus it goes over well at any party, whether it be an ""I'm going to be drunk by the end of the night"", or a laid back kinda ""getta-getha"". It's just a wicked album."
4,Wow. This is from a former hard rocker?,"In the 70s I enjoyed the music of Cream, from which Ginger Baker has risen, and today it looks like I will enjoy the music of Baker and his jazz band. Being a former jazz musician myself, and a rocker prior to that, I find the cuts I have heard to be refreshing. Obviously Baker's jazz roots have never left him. They were in hibernation until he had the chance to release them again. As he said in the interview, a lot of the music Cream performed was improvised and jazz music laid the groundwork for improvisation, so it must be a nature to return to that style, when in fact he never left it. Check it out."
5,"As a ""recovering Catholic"" and Jewish convert I see the parallels to the conflicts they feel.",After reading Unorthodox and the Rebbe's Army I found this book to fill in all the gaps and added so much to the issues in question. I appreciated all the conflicts Hella's interviewees felt as they parallelled my experiencing conversion to Judaism from the Catholic church. I want to learn more! I have so many more thoughts.
3,okay,The book was pretty good but it did not delve as deep as I would have wanted it to. It felt like something was missing.
2,Unchosen: The Hiden Life of Hasidic Rebels,"I did not walk away feeling that I learned anything new about the Hasidic community. After reading about each ""so-called"" rebel, the story line did not provide any new insights. In fact these people did not seem like rebels, just people who questioned their life-style.Often it was stated, they just changed clothes, and I met them at a Starbucks to protect them from what their families or community members would think. You talked of a couple that left Williamsburg to live in another part of New York, and it just stopped. The book started out by discussing an interaction the author had with a group of Hasidic women, and it just stopped at that point. Not alot of depth to the book."
1,An Author with an agenda,Impressive amount of research and detail in this compilation of stories of hasidic jews who desire to live non hassidic lives. Unfortunately the author bends over backward to portray the potagonists as innocent victims of some hassidic conspiracy. She clearly has no objectivity when she excuses or marginalizes drug use and goes on to condemn some parent or community leader for being protective of others.Not at all a fair representation of the hassidic world which she has less and less compliments for as the book progresses.
1,A Book That Does Not Live Up To It's Title,"the very definition of hearsay is: ""unverified, unofficial information gained or acquired from another and not part of one's direct knowledge"".that definition sums up this book to a ""t"". i suggest not wasting your time."
1,Incensitive Writing,"The author has Chosen to mention only the Unchosen, and then making an entire community sound like bad people being forced into their beliefs.I believe this book would have been a good book, if it would have described Positive & the negative side of the Hasidic Rebels of the Hasidic community."
2,"Eh, very over rslated",I was very let down and expected so much more considering her prologue and ending. Very high school book report type of writing and depth. It should have been the first chapter of something of more quality. An easy read that is neither scholarly nor remarkable. Fascinating topic that should have been less Hella and more depth. More like a magazine article than a book.
3,I wanted to have more information.,"While I believe the stories, and they are important to tell, I would like to know if any of the people cited were able to cope by becoming Modern Orthodox. I would like to know if they were able to recover enough to find new mates or love interests. I would like to know about jobs. The author left out many of the details I would have liked to read."
2,BORING!,I have read plenty of books about this topic. This was probably the dullest one. I found the writing to be lackluster. I just could not wait for the book to be over. The topics in the book are of an interesting nature though. It as not very engaging.
4,Unchosen,I can't say that I enjoyed this book but I learned a lot about Hasidics and their religious practices. I would recommend this book to people who want to learn about religions other than their own.
3,The Untruth,"Reading this book made me sad and angry. It paints a picture of a people that is in large part, untrue. Yes , there are misfits in any community, but the Hassidim as a whole are G-d fearing people with very intact and emotionally healthy families. If Hella Winston is searching for acclaim as a writer - it would have benefited her to have interviewed the families of her subjects to find out their perspectives. I have personally met at least two characters in her book and they are highly unstable and chemically imbalanced. How unfortunate to characterize an entire people by its misfits. Some her research is just plain false.For example, although our children are initially sheltered from as much immorality as possible, Ultra Orthodox women can engage in as much intellectual stimulation as they please. Case in point: the writer of this review."
4,A follow-up to a modern 1L,"This book offers a completely different perspective on law school (specifically the second year) than others out there (at least what I have read). This text doesn't list out what you should or shouldn't do. Instead, it presents one man's story during his second year from August to December. You walk away from each reading deciding for yourself what were his good and bad choices. This text is written journal-style. As such, some topics skip around. The overall text seems lengthy, however it gives a realistic illustration of how tedious the second year can be. It focuses a lot on ""the job search""...listing out rejection letters, following phone calls, and divulging interview blunders. These on-goings coincide with trying to manage coursework as well. An excellent book to read during the summer before the second year or for anyone trying to piece together what law school is all about."
2,Uninteresting and marginally helpful,"It apppears that the primary purpose of this book is to warn prospective law students of the unlikelyhood of getting a summer internship. While a valuable lesson, it is the only one contained in the book. Nothing can be gained from this book except a reminder to take school seriously. For individuals trying to determine whether to go to law school, I recommend looking elsewhere."
5,best single on the album,"This is the best single on the album (for more really great songs like it, just go ahead and buy ""A Long Way Home""). It's a country shuffle that breaks into a really cool bridge part way through; definitly worth a listen!"
3,"Ok for play, not for collecting...","I ordered this for my grandaughter, but they weren't as large or detailed as I'd hoped. I went back and ordered the larger versions, which are expensive, but very detailed and life-like. The smaller ones are fine for general play, but not for ""collecting"", which is what I wanted to begin with."
2,Not a hit,Present for my 6 yr old grand daughter who loves cats but she was not impressed with this.. The quality is very poor..
3,a butchered version of All Hopped Up,"I wish they had done a straight reissue of All Hopped Up instead of adding inessential bonus tracks and leaving out Cecilia and Call Him Off Rogers, two of my favorite songs from the original. Skip this one and go for the Japanese import."
4,Is it just me?...,"This album has some straight up, right on, rock 'n roll boogie woogie...the kind you can't just sit still while listenin' - you gonna be tappin' that toe, saggin' them shoulders, & probly even wigglin' that booty too! ~8)And hey - is it just me, or hasn't anyone else noticed the similarity to those great R&R; icons, Little Feat? The REAL Dixie Chickens, before they crossed th' road! I found 'The Q' completely by accident - and smile that the Fates steered me this-a-way. So, climbin' on board - gonna ride with 'em awhile....time luvs a hero. *ribit* Shut...UP! ~8)~J-Hi"
3,A Serious Attack on Freud,This is Emil Ludwig's serious attack on Freud and everything he wrote. Not a scholarly evaluation but a diatribe. At 317 pages is gets a bit tedious.
5,Intrique of a Genuine Hero,"This film is a great portrait of an authentic hero of WWII. It is tragic that someone got away with killing one of the best generals we've ever had, not to mention get away with hoards of gold bullion.This is a riveting, bold, plausable, and moving story. Well worth seeing. Bring on a DVD version!! Better yet, re-investigate the crime."
5,review,"If you're a war buff, you MUST HAVE this movie, It's about a true insident during WWII, and what may have actually happened to Gen. George S. Patton.I asked foe years for this to be put on DVD, I have the orginal on VHS, This is a GREAT movie!!!"
4,Very Good Film,"This is a Very Good Film, with a Good Cast, headed by, Sophia Loren & John Cassavetes, and assisted by, George Kennedy, Robert Vaughn, Patrick McGoohan, and Max Von Sydow as the Cold Blooded Assassin. The story is about the missing German Gold at the end of WWII, and the Death of General Patton. Though the story may not be true, it is plausible and great fun too watch. This is a great Rainy Day Movie. I originally had this film on VHS. I waited for it too come out on DVD. It is a WB Archive Collection Disc, made on demand. It is NOT Remastered. The Quality is good."
3,Not a top league war film,"I have seen this on beta and vhs over the years and now have it on a dvd-r from a vhs copy,and I cannot find the same enthusiasm as other reviewers,sounds a good story and has loads of big name actors in it which should help,but does not,far too slow and much too talkie to grip you and some of the stars are just wasted on small parts,also jumps around too much,and I even have the vinyl lp soundtrack,which also puts you to sleep.If it ever makes it across to dvd or blu ray and in widescreen I may change my mind,but would never be high on my want list."
1,A Piece of Garbage,"I bought this tape, 'Brass Target' as a gift for my 80 year old dad. It looks like a bootleg tape, all grainy and impossible to hear what anyone is saying. What a piece of junk! I want my money back."
4,Very Nice and Simple,"This scanner is one of the best for it's price. I just picked one up about two weeks ago for my home office and it's been a very good buy so far. The scanner itself is very easy to use, and the software helps a lot. No matter what you need the scanner for, it works very nicely and is a great addition to any home and/or office. I highly reccomend it."
1,Optical character recognition is poor,"I purchased a 5300 primarily to manipulate text. However, the optical character recognition feature is so poor that trying to correct just the spelling on one page of typewritten text takes way too much time. For example it picked up the word 'this' as 't!Jis' which is so poor a rendition that the spell checker was unable to recommend a replacement. Additionally it imagines things that are not on the page. It averaged twenty such errors per page. Don't buy this product for text manipulation!"
4,"gypsy moth version of ""Looking for love in all the wrong places""!","I bought 3 gypsy moth traps and hung them from tree branches in my approx 1/2 acre lot. I could have used a couple more. I have trapped many moths and have to empty the traps about once or twice a week and put fresh soap water in. (I suspect if you don't do this the smell of decaying moth bodies might render the pheremone bait less effective.) I did not see in the instructions that you could refill them so I was pleased to find the bait remains very effective thru several water changes. Next year I will try ro buy only the pheremone bait to replace. I think for what amounts to a modified plastic jar they are quite expensive, but it certainly seems to work well-so gotta go for it!"
5,IT REALLY WORKS,"After 2 years of defoliation of my 13 oak trees-I'm looking forward to minimal problems this year! I put the traps on 6 trees in early July-went on vacation for 10 days-came home to traps OVERFLOWING with captured, dead female moths. I emptied them and put them back to soon be refilled with victims again. It's now April and as I look to spray any egg masses on my tree trunks(before they hatch into black caterpillers), there are few to be found! I will definitely put traps up again(with new bait) this season."
2,Doesn't work,"This trap doesn't seem to attract anything. I followed directions exactly, but the moths only use the trap to light on, not want to be attracted to get inside. If anyone has any ideas what might be wrong I'd be glad to hear from you. Otherwise I would say the bait is old OR this just doesn't work!"
3,"Fantastic sound quality, but only mono.","When you take this little player out of the box, it looks cheap. When you plug it in and use it, it sounds wonderful! It also has the nice feature of being able to use a battery, or the car adapter. But, as I listened, I realized that my brother was right: many of these little gadgets only transmit in mono, including this one. So, basically it's a cute little thing (although slightly cheap looking - the plastic is of inconsistent thickness over the screen) and it sounds GREAT, but if you want stereo, you won't get it from this. I will be returning mine and getting one that will transmit in stereo."
4,Works great at a low price,Let me star by saying that I received my item 2days before estimated arrival. I use it with my HTC EVO mp3 headphone jack. I keep my phone volume 3/4 of the way up and this allows excellent audio thru my truck speakers. The display screen is just the right size and it lights up when press. I use it in the city in Chicago with no static!!!My ONE problem is that the cable that connects from the transmitter to the jack seems to cheap so I had to rap it with electricity tape just a lil piece.For the price a great lil device :)
2,Worked... for a bit,"Frequency becomes reset every time device is shut off, and so far it turns off all the time after a few minutes. Waste of money, IMHO, avoid this cheap foreign made item and find a more pricey and reliable one from a well known company or at least from a brick and mortar, so you don't have to mess with mailing anything back."
1,Turns off every few minutes,"Terrible product. I put a new battery in it, and it turns off every 3 minutes or so. I plugged it into my car using the adapter, and it did the same thing. Waste of money."
2,Deal breaker is it doesn't retain frequency set when turned off,Who is going to manually set it up for each use when it could easily been written into the software. If you don't use FM 88.1 don't buy it.
3,Get a radio with Auxiliary input,I give this item 3 stars because of it's build quality and performance compared to others but in all reality if you are any kind of music lover you MUST get a radio with Auxiliary inputs. My best experience with any transmitter was really sub par any good radio station and I have been through 3 different kind. It probably can be accounted to my car's stock antenna but I see no reason upgrading that over a radio with no Aux Inputs.
3,Eforcity Black Universal All Channel FM,Have had a little problem with frequency shifting after the unit gets warm. Trying to find an open channel on the FM dial isn't as easy as it sounds especally while traveling. Takes a little tweeking to keep clear reception.
2,Awful product,"Awful product, don't buy it. Burns batteries in less than 2 hours. The audio connector is fragile and the tip broke off after two days."
2,very bad quality of sound,It transmits the sound in a good distance but quality of sound is really bad. I returned it the very same day I bought.
1,unnacceptable garbage-like from a drug store,"i recently bought this fm transmitter because of the low price and the features. well, ""you get what you pay for."" i think the manufacturer put wrote other comment. the sound quality was horrible. not just bad. but when there was no static, it was bad. and i had the transmitter 1 foot away from my sony radio antenna. 15 feet away and i'll i got was static. i am returning the product. there is no brand, it's like i bought it from a drug store. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!!!!!!1"
5,Whose Toes are Those?,Another book that I bought for my grandaughter to teach her about her anatomy and also about her color. It shows her that her brown color of her toes are beautiful and to make her aware that it is beautiful being Black.
5,Great book,I bought this book for my 18 month old. He loves it and we read it over and over again. It arrived in excellent condition and just in time for Christmas.
4,cute book- my baby likes it,"This is a cute book, my son loves it when I read it and tickle his toes. The only problem is this book is meant for girls, one line says ""the girl with the cute button nose"". I didn't look through it enough when I bought it and didn't realize it was meant for a girl. I wish it was non-gender specific, but oh well, I will still read it to him and just change the words."
2,Where's the overview?,"Beautiful book, but I never found the lake with my family's cabin so I could locate parks in proximity to it. A good map of the province with reference to detail maps would have helped, but for someone interested in Bob's Lake, there's no useful info. It did not meet our needs."
3,BETTER AS AN ARTICLE,"Fukuyama presents a lot of important ideas, but it is over-padded. The ideas would come across more coherently as an article or a 95-page book."
2,Not a book with a great deal of insight.,"The author uses overseas Chinese societies such as Taiwan and Hong Kong to make predication as to how China will develop. One predication he makes is because none of these Chinese societies was able to produce a world class company because of the lack of trust in Chinese society, China would not be able to do it either. What he fails to grasp is all these overseas Chinese societies were formed by people of Southern Chinese descent. The cradle of the Chinese civilization is around the Yellow River region, in the northern plain. Southern and Northern China have a great deal in common, but they also have a lot of differences in many areas. I personally have lived in both regions. Anyway, some world class Chinese companies such as Huawei and Lenovo are already emerging, and it looks almost certain more will come."
2,A great idea that doesn't make it.,"A ""cut-and-paste job"" that repeatedly leads one to think that it is going somewhere, but rarely provides adequate substantiation of the author's claims. It eventually gets boring, boring, boring."
4,"Brilliant research combined with a lucid writing style, but.","This book blends together extensively detailed research and great style of presentation. Immensely readable. However, a vague feeling persists that data has been ""fitted"" to support the theory being presented. Any mention of Latin America, Indian subcontinent, Africa and others has been completely glossed over. Also, the picture being painted for China is not flattering. A long-term sustained prosperity for China is not predicted by Fukuyama, based on his observation of Chinese cultural values. But all-in-all extremely informative and provided insights into the cultural aspects of macro-economics."
4,Good neo classical economics from a non economist,"This book argues that economic development is 80% good economics and 20% good culture. This is not a new concept, as many other authors, such as Lawrence Harrison, have grappled with the issue of culture in economic development.Fukuyama slices culture and focuses particularly on the issue of trust, as the bond that reduces transactions costs. The literature on transactions costs is also vast, initiated by Coase in the 1930s.The main contribution of this book is to establish an empirical link between trust and the reduction of transactions costs which consequently account for a more friction-less economy. However, as a non-economist, Fukuyama writes to the international relations and political science professional, as a respected scholar mainly in these circles. As such, he does a good job of bringing somewhat theoretical economic concepts to the forefront of policy makers."
4,close to original pressing,This disk was a re-pressing of one of my fav albums.. (Songs aren't listed (Printed) on the disk itself anymore. Product delivery was quick and the price was fair. Overall an above-average transaction.
5,Simply the best,"This is my #1 favorite album ever, and 10+ years later I still have a habit of christening any new stereo (boombox, walkman, car stereo) by putting in OBRS and cranking it!I'm also glad to see, 10+ years after being a weird high school student with weird, unappreciated musical tastes, that you all are still listening to and enjoying this record. Rock on."
4,The Essence of Zeppelin for the Alternative Nation,"This album shows how ""alternative"" bands from the Eighties were really great pop bands ignored by the hair-metal-adoring scourge of the time. Only a band like Led Zeppelin could place this many different styled songs with different textures on one album and make it work. (""Waka"" sounds like an instrumental update of ""When the Levee Breaks"", ""Devil Song"" is like a breakneck visit to the Middle East ala Page, and ""She Divines Water"" is esoteric and accessible all at once.) Throughout, Jonathan Seagal's violin helps spice already flowery arrangements. The mix is loud and busy, but in a good way. The whole album is upbeat, which makes the ponderous and gloomy, yet still good, follow-up (Key Lime Pie) all the more puzzling. The group broke up after that one...This Pre-Grunge Ecclectorockers' Finest!"
2,Not as great as I expected,"If you want a good compilation of Mana live, then buy their 2 CD compilation Mana En Vivo. The guys play really good live and Mana En Vivo captures their on stage talent better than MTV Unplugged."
5,Live is better than the original,"Maná is one of the better known and talented recording artists to come out of Latin America in recent years. This particular CD contains a recording from MTV Unplugged of some of the group's best songs. In particular, some of Mana's most impressive tracks include the live versions of their hits:-En el Muelle de San Blas-Perdido en un Barco-Te Solté la RiendaFrom very high energy to slower melodies, the music is a tremendous represenation of Rock en Español with catchy latin rhythms combined with the best influences of modern rock. You don't need to speak Spanish to appreciate the music on this CD. Buy it and you'll enjoy it."
4,Excellent CD.,"What can I say about this band? Practically that it has captivated the ears of many. They are a true band which demonstrate the talent lying beneath them in every single record. This one is a perfect example. It was already time that they had done something like this for all their fans.The band included or performed, in other words, almost all of the best songs of all their albums. This is great for somebody you doesn't have anything of Maná. But in the other hand, one thing which I believe should have been better was that they could have made from this performance much more- a really big boom for them. Also, another negative thing is that for the lovers of heavy guitar or electric guitar music this album will be a bit boring. Because come on- let's face it: Some songs don't sound that good without their electricity going through them.But, in overall, buy it. You won't regret it."
5,LOS MEJORES MÚSICOS LATINOS EN EL MUUUUNNNDDDOOO,"Yo soy fan de Maná desde finales del '92, yo tengo toooodos sus disco, desde Maná (1er disco) hasta el unplugged y solo me queda decir que Maná ha logrado estó por ellos mismos, por su música, no como gentuchas por ahí que se han hecho de pura publicidad, tal es el caso del boricua que canta María. Este tipo de verdad que no sale de su ritmo, todos son iguales. Para los que digan que Maná no sale su ritmo estan equivocados, tal vez les parece eso porque no los han comparado con los demás, les invito a comparar su sonido, sus letras y sus grandes conciertos, a ver si ahora ya les suena diferente. Bueno, este disco acústico suena excelente, en lo personal me gustan la de Se me olvidó otra vez, cachito y rayando el sol........ ¡¡¡¡MANÁ, EL MEJOR GRUPO DE ROCK EN TODO EL MUNDO!!!!!!!!"
4,ESTE CD ESTA BRUTAL,ESTO QUE ESCRIBO VA PARA LA DE P.R. QUE DIJO QUE ERA LO MISMO DEJAME DECIRTE QUE ELLOS SE HAN DADO A CONOCER POR ESAS CANCIONES QUE DICEN TODAS SUENAN IGUAL. COMPRENLO!!! ESTA BRUTAL :)
1,A horrible band,"Mana no es un grupo representativo de la musica mexicana (Mana is not a band that really represents Mexican music). Todo su exito se basa en copiar los primeros discos de Police (All its success is based on stealing the style from The Police's early albums). Ademas, son demasiado habladores y solo se dedican a criticar y provocar pleitos y falta de union entre los artistas hispanos (Besides, they talk too much and they love to create fights and friction among Latin singers)"
4,This is a really good live album..........,"This album is a really good live album from the best latin american group ever(Mana of course), there is alots of differences type of music, such as pop/Rock and Reaggie. al from beautefull ballads such as ""No ha parado De llover"" and Vivir Sin Aire"" to the good rock song ""Ana"" and the song ""Rayando El Sol"" which was the band first hit.....But there were some good song missing in my opinion, that was the reason why I didn`t gave it 5, and I prefer original album, instead of live, but this was an exepction of course. Buy it if you like Mana.But still I am waiting for a ""Best of Mana"" album."
5,MANA MTV UNPLUGGED,This CD is great. Alot of old songs but they sound even better on this CD. If you are going to purchase a Mana CD this is the one to buy!
4,"Great accoustic show, from a great latin band","Being a Maná fan for over a decade, this CD has a different feeling, it was great to hear songs like ""Oye Mi Amor"", ""En el Muelle de San Blas"" being play different, as well as the cover songs. This CD is for everyone who like great music, fan or not a fan, you'll enjoy it a lot."
5,Maná is incredible!!!,"Maná is one of my favorite bands, and this is by far their best CD. If you are buying this, I would also suggest MTV Unplugged by Shakira (also incredible) and by 10,000 Maniacs."
5,Beautiful!,"Heard ""Muelle de San Blas"" in a bar in Puerto Rico and then another one of their songs on the radio down there. As soon as I got home I downloaded this album and I can say there's not a clunker on it. It's all good. Play it for your girlfriend, she'll love it!"
