2,"Ok, but only good for a few months","I purchased this in store and needed it for my 6 month old who wasn't crawling yet but rolled all over the place. It was easy to set up and is very sturdy, but it doesn't actually swing open. It worked fine for us semi-closed for a few months but once my daughter started crawling she refused to stay in such a confined space for more than a few minutes at a time. Now we broke it in two pieces to fence off certain areas but in a few more weeks when she is strong enough to climb on it, it will be completely useless.Do not get it if you can't climb over it. It doesn't actually swing. Do not get it if you plan on folding it up. It is SOOO difficult, feels like it will snap any second. I also doubt any child/baby would be happy being confined in it for longer than 10 minutes. I wish I thought more long term and purchased doorway gates instead."
5,The Best Yard!!,I buy this so i can have my son in only one area clean and secure to play...The Best i recomend this product..My son like it to. We have labrador retriever and he like to play with my son's toys so this is perfect for us.
3,No gate!,"It is a good product if:- your baby doesn't mind to be left in the play-yard- you need to put a fence for your media center/xmas tree/ fireplace- you don't mind to climb over it to pick up your baby (there is no gate!)overall it is a good product, but I recommend checking the other yard by Summer Infant"
5,WORKS GREAT,"we love this thing! we have a long set of stairs in our living room, so we can make the gate long to cover that, or we can enclose her to play with her toys or take a nap. I cant wait to use it this summer! :) LOVE IT"
2,Ok but wish it didn't break easily,The shipping was fast. I love the padding so it doesn't slide on my floors. My only issue with this gate is the second day I used it one of the end panels broke as I was trying to fold it back together
2,Wish I liked it...,"I was so excited for this to get here to help keep my little crawler from getting into too much trouble when I can't be sitting right next to him. Unfortunately it is extremely difficult to bend at the hinges and one or two of the panels are warped. I read the directions carefully but cannot get the gate to close. Being such a hassle to get it into the hexagon in the first place, I have a hard time imagining the task of setup and take down each time we want to use it. I will give it a little longer to get used to it--maybe the hinges will loosen a bit, I will figure out the elusive trick to closing it, and the warped panel will stop driving me crazy--but as of now I am awfully disappointed."
4,good product for the price,i got this for my grandson for when he comes over-i have a lot of items that are breakable or with sharp edges. i open up the yard and block off what i don't want him to get into. it serves it purpose but as mentioned in some reviews-will fall over if grabbed. my grandson likes to shake bars..so you just have to watch him! otherwise so far so good...
5,North States Superyard,"This playard has been WONDERFUL!! It arrived earlier than expected, which was fab, and was very easy to assemble. Our baby niece can now play happily in a safe environment when the adults in her life need a few minutes to do other things. We have it set up on a carpeted area, so I don't know what it would be like on floors or tiles, although there are rubber pads on the ""posts"" to keep it from slipping. Sturdy but flexible to move around and reshape, I highly recommend this product."
3,OK if you have something to tether it to,"This play yard is adequate as long as you have something to keep it in place. My two year old figured out she can lift one side of it and walk wherever she wants without having to get out of the play pen. If you use it outside, be prepared to see your child walking across the yard with a play pen behind him/her.Also, cleaning it is a nightmare! If it gets dirty and you need to clean it, you better have a pressure washer handy or you'll be at it for hours. Other than the obvious problems with a plastic play area, it comes apart fairly easy and is simple to move in and out of the house. The 3 star rating is only due to the light weight and difficult cleaning."
5,Sturdy Product,"This is a very sturdy gate, love it. You can buy more pieces also wich is great.. I would buy again if needed."
4,Everything they say it is,Read the description and what everyone else has to say about it - it's exactly that. I'm happy with it - serves my purposes (which is keeping my active one-year old away from any and all danger).
4,Pretty good product,I bought two of these to keep my one year old away from things. One is around the Christmas tree and the other I split into two sections to keep her away from the fireplace and my records (she loved to wave them around and put them all on the floor). I anchored them to the wall so they stay in place well. She likes to throw her toys over them sometimes but other than that she ignores them. They do a great job of keeping her away from things. I wouldn't use them to put her in because I like to let her have the run of the house except for the areas she shouldn't get into. They aren't very nice looking but they work well for what I'm using them for.
5,Resistant and flexible,"I like it so much I have 2 sets.It's easy to define layouts, you can attach toys to it and it's very resistant.I really like it and you can pretty much put it anywhere.The plastic is not cheap so, it stands well with your home decor.The only think you have to watch is in case you don't have a closed area, the ends are not stable, so if your baby is trying to stand (like mine is), make sure to have it against a solid place (I have mine against the wall and the other end against a couch in a shape of ""U"").Really recommend this products for parents with babies learning to crawl and walk :)"
5,Amazing! A must have!,My daughter has been mobile and rolling since 3 months so a playpen wouldn't cut it. She is now 8 months and this is still enough space for her to crawl around. I use it in the den. Love it!!!!
3,My 8-month old can move it around.,"My 8-month old didn't like his Pack N Play playard, maybe because it is off the ground, I think. He doesn't fuss when I put him in this one. The main reason I purchased this one is that he was constantly looking for tiny pieces to put in his mouth when I put him on the floor. We don't have carpet. Not long after getting this, he started pulling up on it and is now able to move it around the room. There is enough clearance at the bottom that, if he sees something (such as a popcorn kernel or a newspaper page) to munch on across the room, he moves the playard over to what he wants to get and is able to get it. I'm going to have to figure out a way to secure (probably with a bungee cord) to something so that he can't move it around. The plastic is somewhat flimsy, as well."
4,two sets of northern gate,"We are very pleased with the gate. We bought two of the Northern Gate enclosures and attached them. It makes a nice, safe place for our one year old to play in and we don't have to worry about her wondering off to explore anything if we turn our back."
5,LOVE,This was a fantastic buy. I love love it.... It really helps to keep the children from roaming where they shouldn't go. I leave it open and block off the side yard and air conditioner. It is like a little fence. It also keep the dogs from roaming into the childrens play area. I would recommend this for inside or outside. But this is not a baby sitter. Children need to always be supervised.
4,"Our daughter loves the ""baby jail""","I bought this for outside in the yard and I'm really happy with it. It came super fast, days sooner than expected. I also ordered the extension for it but haven't recieved it yet. It's heavy enough where she can't turn the whole thing over but not so heavy it's a pain to take places. The colors are really bright which might be why our daughter likes it so much. It's kind of a pain to set it up the way it clicks open but other than that we like it. Our daughter gets to play in the grass like she likes and I get to get stuff done outside."
4,Very good play pen,"Arrived on-time and it is very good for my 12 months old. I am using it arround the 60In TV, it works very well and stable enough for my 12 months."
5,Great for Chihuahua's Too,"It's great for chihuahua puppy's, they have room to play, without being underfoot. Also has room for there food, water & litter pan."
5,Awesome!,"I bought this to contain my 1 yr old. At the moment, all 3 of my kids are in it playing! I will use it in the yard for the baby so i can get stuff done, and he can be safe. I am also going to take it to my older son's practices so the baby can play safely w/o having to push him around constantly in the stroller. We also will be taking it on vacation for the beach. It seems pretty sturdy, although I probably will anchor it to the fence to be safe. I ordered the 2 extension gates. I am glad I did. It is big w/o them, but now he has even more room to roam. Not flimsy at all."
5,"Great price, quality and convenience","Good, solid product. Basically no set/putting together; you just stand the sides up. It folds down flat and has a handle to carry it, too. Nice size for the dog...Unbelievable for the price. Very happy."
4,great for puppies,This system is great for puppies. It is easy to put up and take down. It fits flatly in the back of a small car and becomes an instant safe haven for pets. It is also easy to move around inside or outside by sliding.
5,Good for crawlers,"Very safe gate for crawling babies on the go! We use it outside as well for our toddler, and it works great. Portable..easy to set up..love it!"
5,YES YES YES,YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS FOR SMALL CHILDREN! I have a two year old that gets into everything! This keep her out of my kitchen
2,Panels arrived warped,"I ordered two sets and the panels arrived somewhat warped - I didn't think it was an issue until I tried connecting the panels, and the warping really caused the structure to be very unsturdy. Just one kick from my 6-month old baby made the panels wobble a lot. I'm not risking keeping it to see what she can do with it when she pulls herself up!The panels were also really difficult to disconnect and connect - I got really annoyed doing that, but stepping over with a baby isn't very easy either when you're 5ft 4in and the panels are 26in high!"
3,"Decent, useful, appropriately priced","I did a ton of research on play yards and this one came out on top when it came to value and utility. Plus? COLORS!It's quick and easy to fold up, set up, rearrange and move around. We have used it outdoors for 2 weeks of camping, then rinsed it off and brought it in to contain the little one in the living room.Each panel is light-weight, so at a year old we're finding our kid can drag it and escape if she puts her mind to it. (We don't have it configured as a closed play yard at the moment - just using 4 panels straight across the door.)NOTE: With the way the panels are designed, you can only make enclosed spaces with an even number of panels - 4, 6, 8. Of course, there are work-arounds when you find yourself wanting to close in the kiddo with 5 panels...It has pinched me several times, so watch your hands.This play yard is worth the price, but I wouldn't pay more."
4,Great for awkward spaces,We have a few awkward spaces with large gaps that we wanted to keep our child from. I had to look around to try and find some kind of gate that might fit one of these space without us having to mount something to the wall. I did not want to have to do a hardware install for something I will have up for only a limited time. We bought two of these and they have worked great. We were able to take some large gaps and make an effective barrier to keep your child out. Sometimes we had to be creative with the angles and placement of the gate but I don't think I could have found another product that would do the job.The biggest con here is that they can be hard to open and close which is probably a good thing since it makes it harder for the child to do so. That said it can make setting this up and taking it down a bit of chore. Not sure if anything could really be done to fix this.
1,just another baby product that is crap,this was the first play yard my wife and i purchased for our one year old. Guess what after opening and closing the play yard a few times the product broke at one of the joints. Like allot of people have said the product is light and flimsy. Besides if you do not want your child to climb out of the gate dont buy this product. So instead we purchased another gate system that we returned and finally settled on the north states gate system 3 in 1 metal. buy this instead
3,its ok,"I though this gate would have some rigidity when placed in a straight line. Well it does, but it cannot with stand a child going Chuck Norris on it. Also some how I wish it was adjustable in single section and not every two panels. However to the other parents. This hands down is the best gate they make in this price point. And my review is just a personal thought but Tue product is worth every penny"
3,play pen,This play pen works well. It is just heavy to be carrying inside and outside which is what I originally planned. I just leave it outside.
4,Worked out great for twins!,We have pretty active twins and there are really no play yards large enough to accomodate the both of them at the same time. But this play yard with a mat underneath works really well.
4,Good Item,It is as advertised. I would not use this on its own. Will need some support because of the lightweight plastic. Great item if used correctly.
4,Very useful for baby-proofing,This is really good to use extended. We use it to block a whole wall that has a fireplace and other non-baby items. A good safety item. I would have given it 5 stars if it cost a little less.
4,Great Barricade,We bought this to use a a barricade for our dogs to keep them from coming upstairs. This has worked well and because of the way it is assembled you can configure it it in many different ways.so far no problems with breakage that others have discussed. The posts/hinges are stiff and I think it would be difficult to fold it and carry it like it says you can do in the product details. But it works for what we want to use it for.
1,North States Superyard Classix XT Gate Play Yard.,"I didn't like the Superyard Classix XT Gate Play Yard. It's much heavier that I expected. It was hard to open and close to an appropriate shape. Though it indicates it is a good hard for pets (which is what I needed)...it is much too high to bend down over to pick up a dog. Would probably be ok for kids...again, if you don't mind bending over the tall sides and picking them up."
3,Does an ok job.,I actually purchased this for puppies so I wasn't too concerned with how cheap it looked. Two major problems with it are when the puppies jump on it they can actually move it. Which of course moves puppy pads and everything with it. yuck. Would work better on a carpet I would imagine but that defeats the purpose for me. Other major drawback was that it is very hard to break down and move. It would be fine if you were planning on putting it up and never moving it but it definately isn't versatile and you wouldn't be able to travel with it. Looking for other alternatives. Maybe just spend the extra money for the metal one.
3,What They Say Is True,"For the price, I think it is a good deal. However, it is not the heaviest material. My twins are only eight months and I needed something like this to prevent them from crawling into trouble, but they are also pulling up and learning how to stand. So far it has been great support for that, YET keep in mind, I am using 8 panels that I combined from two sets. I figured for as expensive as two extra panels are, you might as well buy a second set of six for t a bit more. That being said, they warn against using more than eight panels as one yard, and eight take up quite a bit of our living room anyway. We ended up using the extra four panels for traveling and that has been good so far. Unfortunately some plastic broke off on one (and only one) piece (when our 13 year old was moving it) so the quality may not be the highest. My biggest fear is that it won't last against my increasingly mobile and strong toddlers."
2,Not for all children,"After the play yard was set up, the first thing our 8 month old tried to do was climb up the side. She was standing herself up by climbing up the side and then once standing she'd stick her little toes in the mesh and start scaling the side. The mesh siding of this model make this possible as opposed to the more expensive models with bars. Needless to say we had to return this and the extension costing us the expensive return shipping fees for both separately(but that's the chance you take when buying from Amazon). This gate may be great for most little ones but steer clear if you have a little acrobat like ours."
5,Houdini Play pen,Bought this play pen for my 5 pound poodle and realy like it becayse it gives him enough moving room and yet keeps him from making mistakes in the house. I reduced its size and only use 4 sections and therefore it makes a neat rectangle which can be put in a corner out of the mainstream.
4,works!,"I needed something that I could use to block off 2 railings and stairs, or a section of the living room. I could have just used a gate and two railing nets, but this was more cost effective and gave me more options for my crawling grandson. Since I don't have him here all the time, I didn't need anything permanent, but it needed to be sturdy! I love the flexibility its given me. I would definitely purchase again!"
4,I'm not dissapointed.,"I knew when purchasing this gate that it wasn't the most advanced gate out there, but it would work as a play area in our living room for my 9 month old. He is obsessed with the wide screen TV and any other electronic we have in his line of vision. haha. So far he seems to not mind playing in the gate. Of course I am there to supervise, but it's nice to have him play in it while I am cooking dinner or something. I have it in the hexagon shape on the letter/number mat and he pulls himself up on it all the time, and he is a good almost 20 lbs, it holds up just fine. :) I am glad I purchased it, I just wish that it was a little easier to open up, or had some sort of a door on it. But for the money, it's worth it."
5,supe playyard,This is a very good gate. Got very fast delivery & I would buy again if i needed another gate.
4,Good product,"Its a very nice sized play pen, bigger than I was expecting. My only problem is the difficulty in snapping the sides into place, but I guess that's necessary so my son doesn't collapse the pen in on himself."
3,"Good product, with a couple of asterisks","I'm happy with this product, but I think the photo showing two children playing in it with room to spare is a little misleading. I'm planning to order extension panels because it's pretty small when assembled as shown in the photo. I also know now that it might have been worth it to spend the extra money and get the metal version; we currently have the superyard assembled in a semi-circle shape, blocking off a corner of our living room so that our 1-year old has a play area, and the plastic is lightweight enough that he can easily push or pull the whole thing over and escape. We have to rig it up so that it's tethered and/or blocked with ottomans, etc. on the outside in order to keep him in for more than 60 seconds."
4,Great Gate for a mobile baby,"We really like that the gate can be shaped differently than just the hexagon. The drawback is that it does take up a lot of room and it's not super easy to fold it back up into a tight package every night. We just end up leaving as a hexagon most of the time. We can even open up the gate and shape it around our couch and coffee table. So this way we can sit an enjoy tv and our baby can crawl around and play with her toys. Overall, I like this gate."
4,Does the job I needed it to do!,"I needed some sort of barrier between my puppy and the walls where I keep him during the day because he discovered he likes to chew drywall when momma's not home. I had looked at dog pens on Amazon.com and compared them to this item. I didn't find too much difference at all - except this item was a nice bit less expensive that the ones that are for dogs. It takes a little effort to bend the hinges, but I think that's probably a good thing if you're considering this as an actual play pen for small children. It's shorter than I imagined, so be sure you pay attention to the dimensions & that they'll fit your needs. It's not too small for what I'm using it for, though, so I'm not disappointed. I'm actually quite pleased with this purchase."
4,Superyard,"I have 8 month old twins and so far I do love this product. It's easy to use, easy to travel with. I do have a warning though, I took it outside and it was sunny, windy day & when the wind hit it, it started to fold up. Later that day, I found out it was about 35 mph winds. I would still recommend this product, but parents, please watch in the wind."
2,Not nearly as big as it looks,"I was shocked at the small space this enclosure actually allowed. The image of two kids playing in the hexagon is totally misleading. My dogs, one 25 lbs and one 47 lbs, could barely lay down inside this space. I wish there was a realistic area information graphic to help understand the relative size of the space. Otherwise, the product breaks down easily. It could use a door though. Picking up my 47 lb dog and dropping her into the space was pretty comical."
2,Bulky and awkward,"I'm a little surprised at the great reviews this item has gotten. It was much bigger (think thicker) than I anticipated. I live in a small condo and there was literally no place to store this thing. Secondly, it was difficult to open and collapse the pieces. I needed something I could set up quickly in the mornings, this didn't fit the bill for my needs. As always though, Amazon was awesome about returning it."
4,"Awesome, and very versitile","The XT play yard is a great product, once you figure out how to latch it closed. It is actually very versatile, the page only shows you using it in a circle, but we have used it as a baby gate to cover large doorways, as well as a room divider to keep out little one in a room. It can also be used in U shape against a wall. Really it's only limited to your imagination what you can do with it. We love the play yard. It folds up almost as small as a baby gate which makes it very easy to store and bring along with you."
3,it's a gate.,"well, i'm not as impressed with this gate as most of the other reviewers seem to be. it does seem durable enough, though perhaps a little too much so -- it's almost impossible to open and close it. i've given in to just always stepping over it, which is a pain, especially with a baby, and sometimes more, in my arms. it's very heavy and NOT something you will easily be able to move from room to room. i'm also not certain of how hard it will be for my son to knock it over when he gets a little older and a little stronger...lastly, it's pretty much necessary to buy the extension, b/c the space is just too small without it. which is annoying."
1,Not up to par,"I bought this play yard to contain an older pet while I was working. It was fine for about 3 weeks then became more difficult to open. After about 4 weeks it began to break and as of the 5th week, it became totally useless. I should've spent the $60 on a sturdier child gate. This is a cheap, plastic piece of junk! So if you plan to use this more than once or twice a year, probably you should keep looking."
4,Couldn't survive without it,"We have gotten a lot of use out of this item. We use it every day, adjust it to make walls around the sofa. We hardly used it as an enclosed area but it works well when we did use it that way. We're looking in to getting another one to make the area bigger so we can finally enclose it without pissing off our highly mobile infant. I would love to ding this item for being floppy when opened up and used as a wall but since that isn't how it is supposed to be used, I can't give it a lower score.Great product. Don't use it as it isn't intended or you will end up with a kid that has cuts and bruises all over his face and falls and hits his head a lot."
2,Not for infants who are climbers,"I bought this item when my daughter was 9 months old. It was only good for few days. When she learned to stand, she also learned to climb it! Her toes fits perfectly on the holes. I put on her shoes, but then she had a strong grip and uses her hands and pull herself up or hangs on it. Manufacturer should redesign this item, by making its poles into horizontal like most gates, and not the diamond shape holes. This product is only good for infants learning to crawl, but not when they learn to stand... and figure out that they can climb it too! I would say this product is only appropriate for 0-9 months old; those who are learning to crawl; and those infants who cannot stand yet."
5,love the baby jail!,"I bought two of these sets to make one larger play area for my 1 year old. Of course as soon as I bought it he discovered life outside the baby jail but that's got nothing to do with the product. As long as you've connected the pieces together so they zig-zag, my son can pull himself up on them and even ""dance"" a bit without me worrying about the jail coming down. I'm not sure how they will fair once he is climbing but currently he crawls, stands and and walks with help and the jail is awesome. I highly recommend it.Note: I received one as a gift and went to buy a second one but it has 1/2 the price on Amazon as it was at a baby-store. The item shipped quick and was packaged perfectly."
3,Good price!,It is difficult and tricky to adjust at each connecting end. But then the price is reasonable and definitely child-proved.
5,Love it !,"We bought the SuperYards to help confine our 2-puppies. They are only 3/5#. It works great for them.I really don't think they are that bad to look at either. And besides we are protecting our puppies and our house too!We used OOK Picture Hangers(20#-type) to secure the Play Yard to the wall using craft wire. As long as you find a stud they hold tight and only create small holes to repair later. We are using them stretched out, although North States doesn't reccommend it, and it probably wouldn't work well for bigger animals or children to do so. I am just happy that it is working for us.Even our older 11# dog has ran into it when playing with the puppies and it stays secure.Sorry to be wordy, but I just wanted to share and possibly help others make a decision.Happy New Year to all!! : )"
4,Play Area,"I bought two of the gates and hooked them together, omitting 2 of the pannels. It produced a 6.5 foot circle. My one problem with it is that the holes are a little sharp, and they have a tendency to make my childs fingers tender when she climbs on it. I would still reccomend it though it is a bit hard to seperate the pieces and link them back together."
5,Cat car cage,"I could not find a cat cage that would accomodate two cat carriers and a litter box. My sister suggested I look in the baby gate section of the store instead of a pet shop. We found the Superyard and it looked possible. I have used it in the back of my van. It is the best!!!!! My cat is free to use the litter box and sleep in the carrier. I covered the superyard with a blanket, but plan to use a screen held down with plastic clips. I used 5 of the 6 panels. Being able to change the configuration is wonderful. I saved money by looking in the baby section and found a perfect solution to my travel problem.Buying the product from Amazon saved me even more money. Amazon service is the best!!!!"
5,GREAT!,I love it. It keeps my puppy from getting into things that may harm her and from things she may harm.
5,Great play yard for twins!,"This another of my ""must haves"" for twins. I purchased this along with the two panel extension for a good size play area. It folds for traveling and can be arranged in many ways so it is very versatile. We take it when we travel and use it all the time at home. I either have it as a pen upstairs where it is not gated or as a fence to block off the fireplace in the living room where it is gated. We took it to the beach house this summer so the boys would have a safe place to play. We also set it up at their first birthday party so the little kids would have a safe play area. I have a foam letter mat that I use as a floor when needed. This is a great product for a good price. I would definitely suggest 8 panels."
2,Clumsy and hard to adjust,"I bought this ""play yard"" for my Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier puppy. I use it whenever I can't watch him but don't want to confine him in a crate. The gate serves its purpose, but I'm not crazy about it.First, one of the pictures supplied by North States looks like you can open and close one panel like a door. That picture is really misleading. Removing one of those panels is no easy feat.Second, adjusting the play yard is not as ""hassle free"" as they claim. It takes a good bit of strength and patience - and it's loud.I wouldn't recommend this product, nor would I ever buy it again. Instead, I would splurge on a more expensive gate that's less clumsy and easier to use."
4,Nice and sturdy,"We borrowed another pen from a friend and my son was able to push it over. This one keeps my son contained. Its big enough he plays in it, but most of all I'm impressed with Amazon's return policy! The first one we got was broken. I got a new 1 within 2 days! Amazon made it easy!"
4,"For the Price, It works.","Bought the play yard to keep my 10 month old grandson in a safe place while I'm doing house work. Although it is not anchored in any way, he has not managed to move it around too much. I am happy with the results, but agree with others, it has been difficult to move the joints and set up the play yard. Now that we have moved it around in various shapes, the joints are getting a little easier to adjust. I would and have recommended this play yard to others."
4,Best gate I've owned,After months of searching for the perfect gate to fit our needs and price range this was the winner. It fit around our Christmas tree perfectly. It kept the tree safe from our dogs and kids! (our presents stayed wrapped too!) it feels a little flimsy when you're adjusting it but it's held up against our household and that says a lot!!
3,Not as sturdy as the North States metal play yard,"If you are using this type of play yard at your house as a permanent item to use for several months, the metal version is much more sturdy. We keep this plastic play yard at Grandma's house for our 17 month old twins, and it is okay as a temporary play yard. It has the advantage of being lighter than the metal one. You definitely need at least one extension panel set."
3,Just good,"I bought this product for my 12 months boy. It worked good, but my son can shake it hard. Because it's light weight so be careful when someone hit it by accident, it can be collapsed on your baby."
5,Play yard,"This has been a life saver. We've been able to block off our twin babies from our 18 month old who doesn't know how to be gentle, yet. It's flexible in its ""joints"" so you can choose how much to angle/bend each panel. I don't think we've ever had it in the same position twice. I step over it (I'm 5'5, but my husband pulls out one end to go in and out)."
1,Puppy Jump,"I received the 8 panel play yard as a gift for my new Havanese puppy. He is 6 months old and weighs 7 lbs. It only took him 2 days to ""scale the wall."" I had to return it. Since it was a gift I'm awaiting a credit in the form of a gift card from Amazon before I can purchase another more reliable item. I wouldn't recommend it except perhaps for a toy dog of some sort."
2,Too short and too stiff,"I thought I had purchased the same gate I had from somewhere else. This wasn't the same one. This one is shorter, which isn't a problem for us, having a small dog, but is way too stiff to maneuver. I wish I'd just bought another from the place I bought the first one, but this was cheaper and free shipping. Bad idea to get this to save a couple bucks. Fingers can be easily pinched trying to operating this playyard and I can see children getting pinched fingers (as well as adults trying to latch this thing). It needs a regular gate or something to make it easier to get in and out off. This play yard is not engineered for consumer-friendly use."
4,"Safe, fast, cheap","It is cheaper to buy 2 separately on Amazon w free shipping than 1 and an extension at Amazon or Target. Shipped in about 4-5 days. Set up in 4-5 minutes. Bought it to enclose a bicycle mounted on a trainer so that little, curious two-year-old fingers can't get near the rear wheel when i am spinning (ie. to keep the kids out). While one unit won't completely surround the bike and lock, the two ends come together close to the front wheel such that my daughter would have to approach through a narrow opening in the front to get close to the bike. It's easy for me to enter and easy to prevent her even if she pulls on the sides, which are light, while i am riding in place. As the weather improves, the bike goes outside and we'll try the play yard outside with the infant. There's no way we could contain our two year old inside it even if we put three of these together but it fits my needs nicely."
4,Does the job,Sturdy. It is a little hard to set up. But it's really much better than the traditional play yard.
5,Wonderful and Safe,Allows freedom for the child. They are able be more independent and safely emplore and Mommy can get things done.
5,Life Saver!,I don't know what we would have done without this item! It saved our lives when it came to baby proofing the house with our infant.
5,great product for the price,Bought this for my 9mo old. We have an open floorplan so this was a perfect thing to have to help him stay safe when I couldn't keep my eyes on him. It also folds easily to store away when not in use! I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a baby in the home!
3,Ok but not great,The plastic is very light and the overall structure is not stable enough unless you assemble it in a hexagonal shape or something that closely matches a hexagon.Also if you have wooden floors this may not sit flat on all corners.
4,Not so sturdy,"I got this for my grandson. At eight months, he is able to push the sides and move it across the floor. He almost pushed it down the other day. That being said, It still proves useful in containing him for play and gives him more freedom that a play pen. I would not leave him alone in it as I would be afraid he would push it down and fall."
4,Good product.,I like the yard as opposed to a play pen. I like the product although it is a bit flimsy and the joints are difficult to adjust.
2,Difficult to adjust,I bought this for a new puppy and it just slides around on our hardwood floors. Needs rubber feet or something to keep it in one place. I found the panels impossible to adjust once they were interlocked. It is difficult to open and close. I just ended up lifting the puppy out of it instead of trying to open the panels. One of the panels was so hard to open it broke within three weeks of purchasing it.
4,Great for baby,"Great product! Set it up as a large play pen area when my son started to crawl. Only wish they made an entry gate attachment. Yes, its easy to pop the fence panels off, but only with 2 hands."
3,"For very young children, not climbers","We bought this for our new puppies. And, of course, our children thought it was their place to play, as well. My two year old quickly figured out how to climb over it. But one time he was climbing out and tipped the whole fence - it was on a wood floor, and so the doggie water spilled so it slid - with him on it. And then it just went on it's side from the momentum I guess. Nobody got hurt, and I'm not saying it's dangerous -- but it should be reserved more for animals and younger children who would be restrained more easily. Also, we don't care for how the gates go together. Kind of not so easily if you want to take it apart a lot. It's more of the kind of thing to leave up. For the price, you can't beat it though."
2,Safety Hazard!!!,"I bought this item about a month ago and really have loved i it. A nice spacious area for my 6 month old to play in safely....until I tried to fold it back down to travel for the holidays. The 8 panels are connected with joints. Unfortunately, in trying to fold the joints, the panels did not fold at the joints, instead the plastic seemed to just snap. This happened in 6 of the 8 panels. It produces sharp shards of plastic. Clearly not something that is safe for use around a child.I am disappointed because it was great having a large area for my daughter to play in. But, it certainly does not open up easily or fold down without issue.Back to looking for another safe play yard!!"
2,"sturdy, but really hard to disassemble!","It's sturdy and surely keeps toddlers inside safely, but disassembling is almost impossible without frustration. You need to push one corner down REALLY hard to get the top part come loose. I feel the pressure I'm putting to disassemble it can throw my daughter away if I hit her accidentally. For this price, there is a room for improvement."
1,Arrived already with a crack!,"This item arrived and was already cracked. I immediately returned it and purchased the Friendly Toys Little Playzone with Sounds and Lights . I'd recommend skipping this one and moving right onto the other Playzone... though it's a bit more expensive, it's better quality."
1,Very Poor Quality,"I just got the superyard XT gate, the plastic cover around one hinge is already broken into some sharp pieces. I will have to return it."
5,I LOVE IT!!!,I love the Super yard!!! I bought this about 2 1/2 weeks ago for my twin granddaughters and they absolutely adore it. The Superyard is HUGE and easy to put together. We have the twins play in the living room and they love it too. Enough room to run and walk around in it & still they play around with their toys. The twins are 11 months now and they only reach up to around 2 or 3 inches above the play yard. I also ordered the extension and its great for when we go to the park or a friends house. big enough to keep their kids in too without and fighting over toys and room. =] We received the super yard in about 4 or 5 days after ordering! I can't be any happier with it. I LOVE IT!!
5,Triplets! Used it Everywhere! Loved it !,"When we moved 2000 miles, we did it in a couple of days. When we stopped at a hotel, I set it up on the floor with lots of clean bedding [ our own ] on the floor and it kept my ten month old triplets safe and happy. When my triplets were 1 and 2, this was awesome! We'd go to the lake for a picnic in the grass and when we wanted to fix food, they were right by us [ and safe ]. I put two together to keep them safe in our very large living room. It was 14 years ago so it was the original with metal hinges and they never got hurt. I had fun stuff in it to play with and they never tried moving it around. Maybe the original one was tougher/ heavier, I don't know. But I'm about to get one for our puppies to kep them safe since the other was given away."
4,A life Saver for the Christmas Tree,"We got his to protect the Christmas Tree from our 7mo. old this past Christmas. Boy has it delivered. Now, we have a section of it protecting the home theater equipment and another section of it keeping the cat litter off limits. It's sturdy enough for the little one to pull himself up on without toppling over and can easily be bended to form new shapes. Adding and subtracting pieces is a snap as well."
4,It works!,I bought this to keep our rabbit contained during his daily exercise time. It works for that purpose. It is a little hard to lock together. Easy to fold and unfold.
5,good product,We use this product to block our toddler from touching our entertainment center. It's done the job so far.
3,"Sturdy, but not the most convenient","This is nearly 100% plastic, but plenty sturdy for toddlers. (For me, the fact that it's plastic is a plus, since I know our daughter would probably get splinters from chewing a wooden playpen, or hurt herself falling into a metal one.)My main gripe is that it's difficult to open and close. The panels pivot and lock at various angles, but the hinges are very tight and you have to push them pretty hard before they ""SNAP!!"" to the next position. Maybe after awhile they'll loosen up a bit. Also, to completely fold it up, you have to disconnect one of the hinges, which is pretty hard to do as well.But it's half the price of the metal and wooden ones on the market."
3,Does it's job.,"the playard is ok it was just very hard to put together and to close the gate. I used all my might to close the gate and it took me about 30 min to finally get the piece in its ""hole"" other than that I have no complaints! Its a great playpen and can use for a gate too"
4,2nd buy,This is my second set.. I wanted my baby to have more room to run so I bought the second set.. Its a great way to keep her safe and have her own space..
4,broken gate,"this is the product we ordered, but 1 of the gates was broken. this is a plastic gate and 1 gate was cracked in 2 places. i didnt bother to contact seller b/c there were 5 other gates to use. i just want to let others know that the seller doesnt check product quality before sending out."
4,great product,"If living in a one bedroom apartment in NYC was not already crammed up enough , when our 12month old son started crawling around and finding his way to the kitchen trash can and bathroom 'toilet cleaner' we could not help but buy a gate.I bought two sets at once so that I could 'fence' my entire living room while allowing ample space for my kid to crawl around.These were cheap and durable.The gate not only served the purpose of keeping our kid safe and giving us moments of peace ,but within a week he was standing, supporting himself while holding the gate and soon started walking...it was amazing as kids of his age hadn't even started crawling yet!!"
4,Nice but a pain to adjust,"We bought this for my 11 month old daughter to keep her in while cooking, doing dishes, etc. She isn't a fan of being in her pack & play & is now walking so getting stuff done around the house isn't very easy these days! A friend has this for her 8 month old & they love it so we thought we'd give it a try. It definitely looks like a dog kennel, but not many kids gates are cute anyway. My daughter can easily push it, even with the stoppers on, if it's opened up. When we have it set up as a hexagon, she can't move it but it is a 2 person job! It doesn't shape very easily, it feels like I'm going to break it & it wasn't that easy to get the 2 pieces to lock together. It took both my husband & myself & even then it was hard. I've seen better, seen worse, but my daughter likes to so that's all that matters!"
4,Okay for bunnies.,"I actually bought two of these products for my pet bunnies. I had hoped it would be large enough for them to be contained and be able to get some exercise. For the most part the pen has done its job. I would have liked for it to have been taller, as my bunnies are able to hop out of it easily. I would have liked for the pen to have been sturdier. One of mine has all ready bent in the middle and as such isn't able to be made into a perfect rectangle. It is okay for containing a small animal, but I don't think it would be sturdy enough to contain a toddler."
5,Just what I needed,This is the perfect baby cage. It is sturdy enough for my 10 month old to pull herself up on and big enough that I could make a very spacious enclosure for her to play safely in.
5,Multi-purpose fence,"We bought two of these play yards intending to make one big play yard for our son in the house to keep him out of the breakables. We ended up using it to box in our breakables rather than our 2 year old :) We connected the two yards into a zig zag - sturdier that way - and ran it along one side of the livingroom in front of the tv and curio cabinets so that he couldn't reach them. It worked great and it allowed him to explore without breaking things or hurting himself.This is a very sturdy fence. The sections can be pulled apart to adjust the length of the fencing. About waist height, easy for an adult to step over, but a child cannot step over or push it over if set up correctly."
5,Great Buy,"Love this play yard, our daughter is extremely busy and does not like to be confined in small spaces like a pack and play, this is perfect for her to crawl around in and she does not feel confined. I would definitely recommend this item to a friend."
3,It's great...,easy to use and i like the color...but I wish it's a bit more stable since it can be pushed and fell...
4,Necessary,"It may not be perfect or look pretty, but it's the best thing I've found. We have 2 1/2 of them to make a huge gated space in our great room. We can be in there with our 1-year old son to play with all his toys. I wish I had know to register for these as shower gifts!"
3,play yard,It works great for outdoors or around stairs. It is really bulky and difficult to move around.
3,Great,"Work well. With 6 panels, it's a little too small.I put it on the wood floor and the whole thing can move when the baby hold on to it. I think on the carpet floor might be better."
3,Ok for Non-Climbers,"I bought this item for my 7 month old as he began scooting and after he was able to sit by himself. It was great as it kept him safe while it allowed mom and me to get a break from holding him. In summary the gate is only as good as the baby is not a climber. Once the little guy started crawling and climbing, as he got older, the more the gate becomes unsafe as he can tip it over. The good thing is that we can at least take the panels apart and secure them to the doorways to use as barriers of entry for Jr. Overall it's an ok product. I wish it had a sturdier base so as to get more use out of it for the price."
5,A lifesaver,"This play yard gate has been a sound investment. So much so we bought two sets. Once the twins outgrew the play area, we used the fencing to wall off the entertainment center and shelves in the livingroom and kitchen so that they could play in the entire area and we could still keep them (and out stuff) safe."
2,Don't but it unless you want your child to make cry,I bought thisone when my lil one was 6months. She stayed inside of it for first half an hour and we were arround the cage. She thought it was a game or toy. Once she realized it was meant to keep her inside she started screaming and she never stay inside quitely for 5 secs. As soon as we put her in the cage she start screaming. Product wise it is good but it has practically no use for me.
2,Serves purpose but without class,"First of all, and the greatest problem, my son freaked out when I put him inside of this. He cried and hung on the side the whole time until I ""freed"" him. It does work and is a good size, but it is so cold, utilitarian, and almost ugly in it's bare functionality. It is an eye sore in the living room. It is really better suited for a pet than a baby or toddler. I haven't used it again after the first time."
2,Not so good for Shelties,"I bought this for my quadruped baby and within 25 minutes, she had climbed out of it. I suppose it works better for babies than puppies. Frankly, I was really disappointed. Apparently the ""mesh"" on the playpen makes it ideal for little doggy feet to get a toe-hold and just climb right on out.However, it is quite sturdy and strong and I was impressed with its quality. The downside is, it is NOT easy to set up and move around. The hinged-joints at each panel are hard, hard, HARD to adjust and move."
1,I have yet to receive it!,I ordered this item about two weeks ago with my Amazon Prime account and I have not received it! I have a crawling and pulling-up 7 month old and this item is greatly needed. Thank alot Amazon... you have disappointed me!
3,Not For Us,"We purchased the Superyard XT because it was the only reasonably sized play yard we could find locally. My husband and I brought it home, set it up, looked at it for a moment and promptly put it back in the box to return. This product is functional, very easy to set up, and seemed sturdy. Unfortunately, it was not something we wanted in our living room; it looked like a dog kennel to us. After some searching online we were able to find a different play yard that gave us the same amount of room but looked nicer."
1,sad excuse,"a horribly sad excuse for rug rat control.if you don't have the commitment or ""a village"" to raise your children ""hands on""put them up for adoption before you make a huge mistake."
4,Great for my 10 mo old,"It may not be the best looking thing to have in your family room, but it is easy enough to take apart and put together again. For the price you cant find a better product."
4,"Pretty good, just hard to set up","This gate is great if you want to set it up and pretty much leave it in one spot.Opening it and folding it into space can be tough. The top and bottom hinges don't always work in synch and the fence bends and torques all crazy. The mechanism that locks the hinges in place is really tight and it can take some doing.Once you get it into position it works great. We have it to seperate the house into an area for the dog and an area for the baby. Neither one can get through or over it.It is also very stable, my one year old son grabs and shakes it and it has never come down.So, it's perfect if you want to set it up and leave it, but if you plan on moving it around a lot it may get on your nerves."
1,not worth the money,"I would have to say that this is not worth buying. The reason...if you want to keep your child from roaming around while you are out of the room, like cleaning the kitching, this will not do it, for all he/she has to do is move it to where he/she wants to go. also it will tip over if your child leans over to much on one side. We bought the play yard to make sure our child was safe while we cleaned up the house, well, he moved it. He also was able to bend it out of shape (which could have pinched his fingers) he moved the play yard all over the house and was able to get into things that he should not have.so if I could I would returned it, or if I read something like this review, I would not have bought it.on a scale from 1 to 10 I would have to give it a 3"
2,Climbable,"I purchased this for my 7 month old grandson, but he climbs it and gets stuck at the top. From the outside he does the same thing and nearly topples the whole thing onto himself. This would be ideal for a baby who is not so active."
3,Watch out for Climbers,"I bought this system to use as a play pen and they worked great for a few months, but it hasn't taken my daughter long to learn to climb the sides. The criss cross lattice construction gives her foot holds. At first it was cute when she'd make it half way up then get ""stuck."" That was two months ago, now she's 12 months and climbs up high enough to bend over the top at the waist and fall over head first. Fortunately, I caught her the first time this happened. But now there is no ""safe"" zone to leave her for a moment to use the bathroom or cook dinner. Using this is now a process of vigilantly taking her off the sides and telling her ""no."" I'm looking for a play pen that she can't climb!!!"
5,Excellent for keeping baby at bay!,"I love love love this product!!! It's so much bigger than a pack and play and although after a bit of time my baby realized he was being contained, it was large enough where he learned how to crawl, stand, and walk. I have a ton of his toys inside, so it's like a big play area right in our living room (in front of the TV where he can watch his Sprout TV). I am totally satisfied. One of the best baby buys EVER!"
4,"sturdy, set up is a pain","your kid won't escape or push this playpen over...BUT its time consuming to get everything unfolded and clicked into place, BUT i haven't seen anything else on the market this durable for this price range. will serve its purpose, just make sure you have an extra 5 mins for set up and takedown."
3,Iffy Hinge Mechanisms,"My wife and I bought this to keep our 18 month old out of our Christmas tree this year. It served its purpose well. I suppose it is difficult to mess up a child barrier/gate. However, my complaint about the play yard is the hinges. This is a very bad design. They move in about 15 degree increments, but there is no way to release the ratcheting mechanism before moving. So you just have to apply enough force to disengage the locking teeth. It feels like I am going to break the hinges every time I move one. (So far none have broken.)I would not hesitate to recommend this play yard in a set-and-forget application that will very rarely be moved. However, if you need something to set up and tear down quickly, look somewhere else. I feel very confident that it would not take long to break these hinges with repeated movement."
2,Nice..until the panels start busting.,We have gotten a lot of use out of this gate blocking a wide entry to the kitchen. The ends are sandwiched behind the sofa and entertainment center so we don't have to worry about it tipping over. It's great just stationary but I have broken two of the panels now when folding it/unfolding it. I'm not very strong so I don't think it's a good sign that I've already busted two in the six months we've been using it. I wish it were made out of better material.
5,Works well. Love it!,"I bought this for my busy 6 month old and she spent many minutes playing with her toys while safely enclosed from hazards. She just started crawling and this is just enough room for her to get the exercise she needs. It was already assembled, pretty sturdy and is expandable."
4,Just what was needed!!,"Our granddaughter needed a place to play safely, this is what we bought for her. It's good because you can use all of the pieces or just a few, depending on how you want to set it up."
2,Big box with a bit missing,I got this to keep my child safe while she plays but this thing came missing parts to put together. Nothing a trip to the local homedepot couldn't fix but a bit of a hassle to put together when everything should have been in the box.
4,Great product but some flaws,"This is a great product and very well made with one small flaw. The ""gate"" is not easy to open so for anyone with weak hands this may be difficult to use. The joints are also pretty stiff so folding and opening is a bit of a chore."
4,BULKY,It does it's job of keeping the child in but it is a lot heavier than I expected it to be. I would definitely recommend this to any parent/grandparent/child caregiver who wants to keep the child in one place.
1,"Awful, broke the first day","I tried to reposition a section to add 2 sections and it broke; now, because of the male/female hook-ups, I am only able to use it with the same amount of sections as it came, with one broken and the other un-usable."
5,Excellent product,Excellent product. Exactly what we need to keep toddler confined so as to no be able to get into dangerous situations while parents are involved in other activities.
4,Like this product,"I bought this product as a containment gate for a pet. It works great. You can move the panels to different configurations for different sized rooms and areas. This gate was a lot less expensive than gates I saw on pet store sites and definitely more versatile.I use this as a free standing gate for an elderly dog and don't lock it in a hexagon shape as shown in the pictures. To use it as I do, you would definitely want to secure it somehow for use with a toddler, puppy or young dog, as they could easily tip it over.I also agree with the reviewer who commented that it's a little difficult to put up and take down. If you're in a situation where you'll leave it up all the time, it's great. But it is a little cumbersome to put up/take down. But it still gets the job done for me."
5,Puppy enclosure,This is perfect for a new pup. It can be formed into an enclosure for inside or outside use and can be reconfigured to close off larger spaces like a kitchen to keep a puppy within a safe area. And the price was right!
5,Play pen,"I bought this item with a few concerns, but once we got it, in the set up was extreamly easy, it's the best product to keep an eye on your kids. I love the fact that it came with small rubber protectors. It's nice to see a company thinking ahead for the customer, espically for those of us who do have hard wood floors. Thanks for thinking ahead for the customer. I highly reccomend this item."
5,good good good!!!,"I have 2 small terry and these gates is very good to keep them out from the kitchen. I hate it when my dogs are able to find left over food. I first saw these gates at the pet store, but it was pretty expensive. I like it when you can size it to your preference. You can attach as many pieces as you like. Easy to put together and easy to separate."
1,Not even one star-negative one star,"I will read the customer reviews. I will read the customer reviews. I will read the customer reviews. I got snookered, too....This is not Frank Sinantra! and a poor recording at that."
1,WARNING WARNING WARNING,Great MUSIC! Great SONG! There's only one problem. SINATRA DOES NOT SING ONE NOTE ON THIS CD. I was almost taken in by this album. Very misleading.
5,A perfect recording,"I have to agree totally with Coals to Newcastle: this is just a perfect recording. All the voices are excellent, the orchestra, the conductor, everything. But did we forget the music? Sparkling, inspiring, simply wonderful Mozart!I also agree about Thomas Hampson's Almaviva. Lecherous, sweet, angry, just perfect!"
2,"Great book, but useless cd.","CD-ROM doesn't work under Lion mac OS (only works under older versions of mac OS), so I can't use it in my Macbook pro. This information is not available in the website. I feel as if I wasted half of the money spent."
4,Very good computer tests!,"OK, this book comes without Audio CDs. But I already knew this when I bought it. The supporting skills chapter is not very useful and the book tends to be boring after some reading. BUT it has a very good writing section and (the best) it has 7 computer tests on the CD that accompanies it. I took the TOEFL yesterday and I can say that these were the tests that most accurately reflected the actual experience. I have tried Kaplan's, Barron's and Longman's tests, but these were no match. Although I can't highly recommend the book itself, the Practice Tests are a MUST have."
3,Useless book without audio CDs,"I bought this book few weeks ago. I was expecting that book will be enough for my toefl preparation process(at least for reading, writing and speaking sections). But i found later that without the audio cds that book is useless. All the subjects in this book requires some listening parts which is only given by the audio cds. So before buying this product, be aware that you have to also buy the audio cd set. Then you can get maximum benefit from the book.I know Amazon selling millions of products but consumers need more info."
2,Vague Answers,"I have just taken my GMAT and started to prepare for Toefl. However, this book's reading part is not like real TOEFL offical guide. It is unnecassary hard and the answers look like each other. They are vague. The content of reading passages are extremely hard. I believe Official guide is best. Longman is too easy and this book is too hard."
4,Good book!,My daughter found everything she needed in this book. She liked the CD with the practices too. The only minus is that it is very thick and heavy to be carrying in your backpack every day to school.
4,Why pay more!,The label is for the lower end of the catalog but the performance is stellar! I have this piece on a major label but this orchestra made a superb showing.
5,"Required ""Learning"" Reading","This is both a great and a frustrating book. The title and the heroic effort the author took to make it ""readable to the common man"" are astounding. The topic list is very nearly complete. It needs a companion book on ""How to win such (and I guess all) wars."" that is the main missing element; but, the author honestly tells us he is not going there. The frustrating parts for me were the number of the author's ""shoulds"" which come from nowhere we can read about in his book or its references, and that he didn't/couldn't go deeper. It's my lifetime pick for required reading for all of us, so we can get the rest of the job done, eventually!!!!"
5,great little gadget,"Purchased this for my mother who has arthritis and complained about not being able to peel garlic with sore hands. I was skeptical but it works great. Very simple, doesn't take up much room in the kitchen drawer and pretty easy to clean."
5,Great Kids Combo,Bought for Christmas Kids Loved It They have watched it several times since.Space Jam is their favorite keeps them entertained.
4,4 movies in one order! Excellent!,I ordered this specifically for Osmosis Jones but could not pass up the deal for extras :) I am very pleased with the movie and seller for getting it to me just when I hoped it would show up. :) Great appreciation for my seller! definitely recommend buying from this seller and would do so again if a product comes up that I hope to acquire!
2,Conflicting information in description,"The disk features list Closed-captioned, Color, DVD-Video, Widescreen, NTSC. However, the aspect ratio lists 1.33:1.I ordered this based on the Widescreen claim and I completely missed the aspect ratio. When I got the movie, I checked the case to make sure it was widescreen, and I could find nothing to confirm or deny that claim. After playing it, it turns out it's fullscreen (4:3).I'm returning it. My kids like these movies, but as a family we prefer to watch our movies in widescreen."
4,Ron Chernow - House of Morgan,"This book contains a great amount of detail and is generally written in an entertaining style with a suitable amount of ""gossipy"" type items. My criticism would be the over use of the semi-colon - why not just use shorter sentences? Chernow also makes some statements that are inconsistent with the overall quality of the book such as ""they were so handsome that women would chase them down the street"". This is silly writing that borders on idolatry and the editors should have picked up on this as it detracts from the quality of the work. There is also a bit too much of what I would describe as hero worship - these men could not have been nearly as capable and almost other-worldly as they are depicted. J.P. and Jack are treated a bit unkindly in my view.Still a good read and well worth the investment of time. It is a ""weighty tome"", literally."
5,An incredible study into a banking dynasty,"I thought the book was quite amazing in detail, and history of the Morgan family. It really helps you understand how this family grew in wealth and power throughout the years. I thought that it read fluidly, and didn't drone on with needless details that sometimes make reading a book on a subject like this difficult.J.P. Morgan was a fascinating man who built an empire, the drive for power in wealth was at best tremendous in this man and his work ethic was outstanding. Now his ethical choices are another thing but who knows how they would react in those situations if they haven't been in that situation.Once again a fantastic read, I highly recommend this to anyone studying finance, history of banking, or are just curious about the Morgan family."
5,Amazing Biography of an Amazing Family,"The House of Morgan is essentially a biography of a family, a house of banking and the US banking industry. The banking industry which began in earnest after the Civil War and developed through the railroad system is chronicled in a biography of J.P. Morgan and his family. The family became a powerhouse in banking when families were extremely important in the business. The family adapted as the years went on finally forming several corporations and enduring the difficult years of the New Deal where bankers were the enemy. The House of Morgan has survived in some form right into the present. This book is a winner of the National Book Award and is a very good book. Highly recommended."
4,Everything but How.,"It is unfortunate that we must read over 100 pages before we are told exactly how private/investment bankers make money. Especially when we are talking about the house of Morgan. This good book could be so much more if the author remembered that not everyone knows how selling commissions, bond pricing, par, interest rate differentials result in income to bankers. It is worth buying and reading but you may want to pull out a finance text book so you can really enjoy the story."
5,Insightful detail,"The House of Morgan has been an enjoyable read thus far. Mr. Chernow gives able detail about the monarchs of the Morgan family without glossing over all the other ever so important partners, that helped shape the Morgan Dynasty.I'm 300 pages in and haven't found a dull point yet. I highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys American History, World History, and American Finances; and are all intertwined with the house of Morgan!"
4,"The House of Morgan, or rather the business of American Banking","I was pleased with the book, even though it's physically a big book! I enjoyed the layout of the book and the story of the elder Morgan and his life. It was interesting to see all the people that came out of the Morgan house and how corporate greed kind of killed off the good ol' boy network they had going. Probably one of the better books showing the golden age of banking, and the king of it, in an easy to read and follow path."
5,"Brian Wayne Wells, Esquire, reviews ""The House of Morgan""","If a book, once read, does not remain on the shelf, but is referred back to on a frequent basis for additional information, it is a book that is well worth its purchase price. One such book is the Ron Chernow's ""House of Morgan"" (1990).As this reviewer reads other books on the economic history of the United States and relations between Britain and the United States in the 1890's, this book on the life and times of banker J.P. Morgan,his son and the banking firm they developed,is a book often used as a reference guide.The Morgan banking firm has had a tremendous impact on the history of the United States and Europe in the last part of the nineteenth century and the entire twentieth century. Reading this book, conveys that impact in a style that won the book the 1990 National Book Award"
4,America's Gilded Age,"Ron Chernow is good at writing in great detail while making his books interesting. ""House of Morgan"" is well documented as are all of Chernow's books. This book is the interesting story of big banking in the United States and abroad during the period of 1850-1900. Chernow goes beyond the earlier years of the J. P. Morgan empire to the present; giving an introduction to Morgan/Chase as we know it today. The early founder, Pierpont, was ruthless, secretive and rich. The book is a long one, and took awhile to read, but it was worth the time."
4,Something To Think About,"This was one of my sons favorite books. Great for boys. I also like how it covers complicated issues like war and loneliness in the world, but in a context that kids can relate to. A lot of fun to read."
3,Get Inside...but leave the door open.,"Having loved ""Sometimes Tuesday Morning"", (it's definately a desert Isle keeper), I can't remember waiting for a CD release more than ""Get Inside"". It would be a monumental task to outdo or even equal his first CD. All of Johnny's chops are in there. But this CD is more groove driven and less melodic IMO. He treats the old classics better than anybody, but seemed to either run out of ideas or hastily chose where to take his originals on this CD. Perhaps he didn't have time to develope them like he wanted.I'm not disappointed with Get Inside. With the exception of cut seven it's a solid effort. It just pales by comparison to his first release."
5,Awesome Guitar With A Very Cool Vibe,Johnny A. style guitar is unique in that it rocks and sways and sings and crys and it does it all without being self indulgent. He makes every note count. No heavy metal shreading or sleepy smooth jazz or silly electonic effects. Just great vaccum tube driven guitar pure Johnny A. style. This is an extension of his previous CD which is very cool. His music has an edge on it which can't be put into words. If you love good guitar work you'll love this one.
5,One of my Favorites,"Introduced the the music of Johnny A. w/ his first release ""Tuesday Morning"". This release is just as fantastic. Johnny A. has his own style and sound which can only be classified as Johnny A."
5,"""Get Inside"" - Johnny A.","O.K., I've been listening to this CD for over a year now, let me tell you, it never fails to impress me. It continues to bring a smile to my face-each and every cut. There is an expertise at work here. Something that I'm at a loss to explain, other than to recognize a master at work along with the excellent support of Johnny's band mates, his wickedly facinating signature Gibson axe, and the stunningly complicated sound board. I can't wait for another release. Please Johnny let's get in the studio and ""Knock another one out of the park!"""
5,Ecstasy found in the hitherto unknown,"I was gleefully turned on to a new radio station, here in the Pocono Mountains. 102TheMountain.com. These guys are what a radio station SHOULD be about, but seldom are! I heard one track...one lone solitary track..and it made me hunt down the album! They've done that alot to me lately, and my music library has grown by leaps and bounds! And Amazon.com and Borders have been happily handed most of many paychecks! What would I say about Johnny A? Two things. One is, it's a shame he doesn't have more albums out there, and two, this guy does rock, jazz, blues, and everything the descriminating music lover turns over even the most distant rock for! Johnny A, PUH LEEZE have a long and decorated career! I am looking forward to every note in his musical future, and so should YOU be!"
5,Incredible!,"Edgar Meyer is the best and most promising bassist of the 21st century! This album is pure fun and a good exercise in folk listening, and aural appreciation. A must buy!"
2,Disappointing,"I was so impressed with a tune by Mr. O'Connor on the radio that I ordered this CD and ""Heroes"". This one was less impressive than I expected, especially with Yoyo Ma on board."
2,Too stylized for my taste,"I might like this music better in a live performance, but on disc I find it rather grating. The performers seem bent on creating effects--""let's turn those old tunes on their heads."" I think those old tunes have a traditional loveliness and was hoping that these skilled artists could enahnce them even further. Different tastes, I guess."
3,A little old,I ordered this in May and when I got it the use by date was June. Some of it is still usable but I would think that I could get a better shelf life when ordering more than one box.
3,cultures well but the taste...,it produces a very tart yogurt even with only 7 hours of culturing. Using a 4-6 ounce cup of stonybrook or browncow plain yogurt as a starter makes a much milder and better tasting yogurt. If you like tart yogurt this starter is for you though.
4,Sweet Soul of the 70s is Slammin'!,"I got my CDs a day before a major snowstorm hit. Television was boring, so I turned it off and put the CDs in. Wow! It was amazing how many songs brought back such great memories and I smiled for hours. When my 18-year-old son came in the livingroom, I told him I'd shut it off and let him watch TV. He said, ""NO, let it play!"" We jammed for hours more, with absolutely nothing else but good company and good music. It's definitely worth buying if you're into good oldies soul music!"
5,BEAUTIFUL THOROUGH COMPILATION,"I love this and ordered it via telephone and have been listening to the volumes for the last week as I received it in the mail last Thursday December 17, 2009. I believe this is the penultimate collection. There are artist I wish that were included though such as: THE POINTER SISTERS, STEPHANIE MILLS, DONNA SUMMER, ROBERTA FLACK, TEENA-MARIE, ANITA WARD, more from DIONNE WARWICK too; SHIRLEY BASSEY(JAMES BOND themes such as ""DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER,"" circa 1971;and ""WHERE ARE YOU,"" theme from MOONRAKER, C 1979 and many others that were omitted or not present for inclusion. Hopefully, TIMELIFE/RHINO can create future volumes and send them to owner's of this boxset and like myself can just purchase them thru phone or online.To reiterate, this is a must have. I love 'em and pop 3 in my cd disc changer which plays continuously until I change the cd. Great for relaxation and downtimes and just singalong with all your favorites! ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!!"
4,Sweet Soul of the 70s,"I received the boxed set in record time and all cd's were there, quality was there, I put them all on my IPod and took it on vacation - loved it."
1,"Good for carrying things, not much else","I bought the AquaPac based largely on the glowing reviews I read from all over the Internet but I was very disappointed. I tried it first with a Canon G6 and it barely fit; when it was securely in place and the camera was turned on the bag almost prevented the lens from extending. I tried pictures indoors with a flash, which produced an image of a large, white blob, then without the flash, which produced out of focus images. My G6 never properly focused while in the bag, so I tried my Minolta Dimage X60, which fit very well but gave the same results. I tried the bag with the X60 in bright sunlight and out of about 6 pictures only one was acceptable, but even it had a bluish haze. The other photos had a more pronounced haze and not a single one was in focus -- and this was in bright sunlight! I'm not sure what I can do now beyond paying nearly $200 for a camera-specific waterproof case, but the AquaPac is definitely not the solution."
4,Wonderful live performance balanced against audience noise,"The live performance is wonderful, the recording is fine, I only wish I didn't hear the occasional rustle or cough in the audience."
3,"Decent Interpretation, Average Performance","I don't know, I guess was expecting a better performance from an ensemble of such high stature as the Berlin Philharmonic. Abbado's interpretation doesn't bother me as much as the sometimes sloppy playing. There are plenty of imprecise entrances, and several french horn and trumpet fracks. Granted, it was a live recording, but I've heard several live recordings from the Chicago Symphony that seem to be close to perfect, especially in terms of the brass playing. I'd recommend the live Barenboim/CSO Mahler 5, as well as any of the new Boulez/CSO Mahler recordings."
4,Good but not impressive,"In partial agreement with Mr. Hurwitz, the CSO has a much better basedtradition in Mahler than BPO. This statement doesn't mean that CSO is abetter orchestra than BPO. In the other hand, regarding Abbado's Mahler,i've been always an admirer of this conductor`s art in this composer.But there is strong evidence that Abbado's Mahler recordings with CSOare much better played and have more intensity, power and presence thanhis later remakes with the BPO. Consider early Abbado recordings of 1st,5th, 6th and 7th with the CSO, and they are much preferable to each oneof his homonims with the BPO, furthermore Abbado has nothing new to sayin them. This 1st in this CD is a clear example. I find again new insightsand refreshed ideas in his last productions with the Lucerne FestivalOrchestra. To enjoy a great Mahler from Claudio Abbado, go for therecordings with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra."
4,cd,"It is a great compilation of many wonderful songs. I can not say I am a big fan of the performer's style however, as he tends to play an excessive number trils and notes where they are not necessary."
4,a must-have for harpsichord lovers,"I love the sound of this most unusual instrument, the harpsichord. Especially the fast intricately melodic songs. Very enjoyable. This ""Greatest Hits"" includes many compositions perfectly suited to this wonderful old predecessor to the piano. There's even a little funny trivia thrown in: on the song sheet is written: Q:""what did the famous conductor Sir Thomas say that the harpsichord sounds like? A: ""Like two skeletons screwing on a hot tin roof"" :)David Rehakauthor of ""Love and Madness"""
3,Great -- If you want In-depth Information,"After reading a lot of 5-star reviews, I ordered this book. However, I was completely overwhelmed by the volume of information contained in the book. This book has it all, but may not be the book you want if you're looking for an EASY guide to re-vamping an existing resume."
5,Impressive!,"Susan Whitcomb has done an impressive job of covering the world of resumes. This book belongs on the shelf in every job search trainer's office!There is a wealth of information here, from researching employers and jobs to creating resumes both on paper and over the Internet.Bravo, Ms. Whitcomb!"
5,Best book on the subject,I really liked this book and the examples. There were real life scenarios and very well written examples of how to adress them in your resume.
1,bad pick,"do not waste your money on this book, very few examples of resume given, time waster, most time in book spent on grammer."
5,Resume Magic,"Susan Britton Whitcomb's book, RESUME MAGIC, provides detailed instructions on the art and craft of resume writing. As a professional resume writer myself (who has read and reviewed dozens of resume books), I was impressed with the depth of Susan's material. Most resume books do not provide any real ""meat"" but RESUME MAGIC breaks the mold. It's not just a resume book -- it's a complete instruction manual by a writer who knows her subject inside and out.Pat Kendall, Nationally Certified Resume Writer"
3,Himmler's Jewish Tailor,I was disappointed in the way that the book was written. It was hard for me to stay interested because they just jumped from one thing too another and some things that you had already read were repeated.
4,Delightful,"Cheerfully written and full of detailed instructions, this book is a great primer on how to fill your cupboards with delectable (and easy to make!) treats for your family. Will definitely be adding it to my cookbook shelf!"
5,The NEW breakout artist!,"I first heard Liz Larin's music when she was in the critically-acclaimed band, Rebel Heels - they were on Atlantic Records and toured the US. Now Liz is making music on her own, and this new recording just knocked me out when I heard it. Liz makes you hear traces of a lot of different kinds of music in her songs, and that's why people who hear her compare her sound to other artists, but trust me, this music is unique and stunning; it rocks like no other singer I've ever heard. The band is virtuoso, too, but what will draw you in and take hold of you is the songs: you feel like you've lived the emotions Liz sings about, and you feel like she's tapping into your own feelings. The melodies are insistant,and very catchy, and if you give this CD a chance, I think you'll agree that Liz Larin is the best thing going in popular music today."
1,Much Worse than the Second Edition,"Let me sum it up for you briefly.A. Despite Amazon's printed statements to the contrary, this book is not published by Walnut Creek. Its published by FreeBSD Mall Inc.B. Contrary to Amazon's description of the book, it doesn't ship with a FreeBSD installation CD, or any CD for that matter.C. The book has been split into 2 volumes, and if you buy this, what you're really getting is volume one, a.k.a. The user's guide.I suppose the Admin's guide is sold separately, though I don't know where. It certainly isn't here.In a nutshell, what you're getting if you put this in your shopping cart is the first half of the second edition minus the operating system CD.IMHO you should get the second edition. It may be dated, but at least it delivers as promised."
2,Much better resources can be found elsewhere,"As noted by other reviews, this book is only half of the story. There is another guide titled: ""The FreeBSD Handbook 3rd Edition, Volume II: Administrator's Guide"" which you will also need to get all of the content available in the 2nd Edition. That said, you would do best to avoid both of these books and look to other sources of documentation. Most information can easily be found online but if you really like printed documentation (as I do), I would recommend a book likeAbsolute FreeBSD, 2nd Edition: The Complete Guide to FreeBSDwhich was just released. The FreeBSD Handbook has a number of typos, the index in back is awful, and the information is out-of-date (it is targeting FreeBSD 5.X)."
1,"Buy the 2nd Edition, this is a rip off","Buy the 2nd edition this is a 2 book rip off with no CD. The 2nd edition is the whole book with the BSD CD. This is not even 1/2 of what the 2nd edition was. And you can get the 2nd edition for $5.00 today!! If you order DO NOT ORDER FROM CAMIN BOOK, I have been waiting 32 days on them. They do not answer e-mail and they have my cash, another thing is they are out of the USA, i.e. Camin Ilands so you can't do anything about the rip off.."
4,Saves money!,"I still have to visit the laundromat for bigger stuff (like sheets and towels), but this product saves me a bit of money every week on smaller laundry expenses. It's also great for people who are sensitive to laundry soap; in doing the wash by hand, you can make sure most of the soap is actually rinsed out of your clothes (something I find that machines are less than great at doing)."
3,washboard,"The washboard is very poorly constructed. It's fine for my purpose, a prop. However, the wood is roughly sawn and the corners are unfinished and irregular. The wood is also chipped and broken in places. A craftsman did not make this item."
3,"For the price, you get what you pay for.","Well, it's a wash board. Inexpensive. Wood was rough in several places with large (one to two inch) splintering in about half a dozen spots. Couple of other wood sections were rough and splintery. I wouldn't want to use it to wash clothes until I give it a very thorough sanding (otherwise I'll be picking splinters out of my knuckles for a long time).The metal section appears sturdy but I haven't used it yet (waiting on the sanding).Again, it's an inexpensive wash board. You get what you pay for. Despite the rough wood, I still think it was worth the price."
3,Cheap construction,"The product came on time and the price was acceptable, but the quality of the merchandise was poorly constructed for the price being paid."
5,some of the greatest piano music ever recorded,"This set includes the Pollini's rendering of the 24 preludes, which won a Grand Prix du Disc in the original vinyl version. Both the preludes and etudes reveal Chopin at his most subtle and masterful. Pollini movingly brings to life the many voices of these amazing short pieces. If I had to take three CDs to a desert island, the preludes and etudes would be there."
4,This Music Doesn't Need A Title,"I really like this CD because (1) I am a big Chopin fan, and (2) I know these pieces well. Chopin's good point is his romanticism. The tracks on this CD are full of his deep, pasionate feeling for his native Poland, even though he was half French and lived outside Poland in such places as Majorca. He was the archetype of the romantic exile, and did his best to live up to this image by writing appropriately evocative music."
3,Odd reissue of two albums by two different bands,"This 2-in-1 CD reissue that pairs up two early 1970s Brazilian pop albums, ""Isso E A Felicidade"" by Os Incriveis (1975) and ""Pelos Caminhos Do Rock"" by Eduardo Araujo (also from 1975) Not sure what connection, if any, there was between these artists... (DJ Joe Sixpack)"
3,Daily reminder,"It wasn't what I expected. This reminder is available in an undated version and a dated version. The description didn't mention a date, so I thought it was the undated version I wanted. Instead, it was a 2010 daily reminder. I'll probably still use it, but I'll have to blank out references to the specific year."
4,Cool Cushion is exactly that,"I ordered this for the many hot flashes I have now. I use it mostly at night. It works well, assuming you follow the directions for filling it to the letter. My boyfriend has found it useful for sunburns or for sprains or muscle aches. It's soft so it doesn't irritate your skin and feels great when you think you're about to spontaneously combust. Women over 50 will know what I mean and will appreciate the comfort you get from this."
4,Kirchschlager album is terrific,"Angelika Kirchschlager recently gave a wonderful recital at Tully Hall in NY - all Schubert and Wolf. It was one of the best events of the year. Her musicianship, wonderful sound of her voice, and personality made this a truly memorable recital, and this disc is highly recommended, especially if you do not know this singer."
2,"Great Content, Poor Product Quality","Structure and Style: The Study and Analysis of Musical FormsThis is one of the classic college textbooks for musical form. Its a shame that the new publisher, Alfred, released a product whose quality is so poor that the pages come unglued from the binding each time one turns a page. The material is fundamental to understanding this field of study, but the risk in winding up with a pile of loose pages suggests that looking for an old, used hardback copy is a better avenue for obtaining this text."
4,Vocals soar and emotions and needs are recognized.,"I love this mid-tempo. It's bittersweet, self-noticing and self-accepting. Somewhat inspiring even. Too bad Kelly didn't have part in anything besides the wonderful yet subdued vocals.Cover Art: B-Inside Art: N/ASongwriting: BVocals: BVocal Emotion: BVocal Acrobatics: D4.3 stars.Overall: B-"
3,Boring,"I usually love James Levine's recordings. His versions of the Dvorak symphonies are some of my favorites. Thus, I eagerly bought this recording. I must agree with other reviewers in that the recorded sound is top notch. Vienna, as always, gives an alert and well balanced performance. However, this really is the most routine of performances. Levine does little to bring out anything from the score. This is simply a very well executed but boring recording of Ma Vlast."
4,Great show,"Great show - flag this if you like, but just a note: I'm watching it for free on Netflix Instant Movie viewer right now... As of 6/17/09... Of course, you should buy it at Amazon, which is why we're here...."
1,typical egotistical american,"the author went to China with a rather simple-minded purpose--to prove wrong the ""we can always fool a foreigner"" saying. Well, he's succeded, although i suspect anyone THAT intent on finding ""prove"" can succede. This book is the work of a BITTER, self-righteous man who is not only satarical and uncompromising, but appearantly proud of it too. I absolute do not recommend this book."
1,BAD,Worst piece of nothing I have ever paid for. Not only that. I have sent it back and still haven't received a refund. People don't buy this. Just throw your money out the window.
3,Needed a better editor,"Everything you ever wanted to know and not know about the Murphys needed a better editor. There is too much detail here. It's one of those books where you realize that the author did a lot of research because she put it all in the book. There is also too much detailed information here about casual acquaintances, everyone they met. It takes awhile to get into it but after p. 35 it does begin to speed up. Yes, after some time one is immersed in the story."
5,Real Life Is Better Than Fiction!,This delightful story is like watching a wonderful old movie from the 30's-40's! And I learned a thing or two about history!!! I'll be urging my book group to read this.
3,good- If you have a long attention span,"As many reviewers have said, enough has been written of the ex-patriates and Paris.. This biography began intrigingly enough but fizzled out to reveal two wholly self-involved individuals who wandered through a literary era with blinders on."
1,Same old stuff with a fancy cover,"I was terribly disappointed (not to mention a bit bored) by this obsequious book. Gerald & Sara was a superior effort, and I would direct potential readers to that first!! The tone and focus of this superficial attempt make one want to take a long, hot shower -- Miss Vaill is clearly too cowed by her subjects, and too prissy for words. Were these people people, or not? You won't find out here."
1,As superficial as it subjects,"Precious rehashing of these famous rich folk requires no stretch on the author's part and no challenge to the reader. This is safe, already covered material that is basically the written equivalent of a parfait dessert: sugary, sweet, perfectly delightful, but not especially memorable and certainly not good for you (in this case, your mind). This is superfluous biography, easy on the nerves. Enough of this genre already!"
2,Heifetz or Oistrakh instead,"Heifetz or Oistrakh instead..... Perlman spends his time in virtuosity, but the issue is more with the orchestra where Levin's direction is totally neutral, lifeless and even boring in some moments... Definitely try the Grumiaux version, Oitrakh (EMI) or Heifetz (Sony). Personnaly i like the power and fantastic sound deployed by Oitrakh's violin in all his records, certainly the most impressive: this man had an incredible force in his arm to play so nicely and he is unique. Heifetz (Sony) is different and in the fourth and fifth concerto, so emotional that you listen the records everyday with the same admiration and emotion. Then you realize why Mozart was unique, and also why he deserves that artists make the effort at least to be lively when playing his music and not monotone. Mozart violin concertos are uncomparable, and I would advise staying away from this record."
1,not as advertised,The picture in their ad shows 4 hangers which I really needed but only received 3. Also I can not detect any cedar order at all. One good thing about them is that it's easy to put the hangers on and take them off the hooks.
2,Not sturdy enough,"I was so excited when these arrived - they created so much room in my closet. But tonight, I learned that they aren't very sturdy - the weight of multiple items hanging off the hanger stretched out the plastic, and now it doesn't have enough curve left in the plastic to hang over the closet rod. To be fair, I was hanging multiple items off each hook - it has 5 hooks on each one and I had 2 or 3 hangers on each hook.So, if you're looking to hang exactly 5 items on them, they may work -- but beware overloading."
1,Not recommended! Only good for LIGHTWEIGHT garments!,"The problem with these hangers is that they can't support the weight of 5 garments. Unless you were planning on using these to hang up 5 camisoles or light blouses, these are not recommended. I bought several packs and used them to hang cardigans and blazers, but within 3 days they all fell down because the round part that hangs on the closet bar straightened out and fell right off the bar. The plastic is too pliable to support anything but the lightest weight garments.By the way, if your intended use is for very lightweight items, starcrest.com and taylorgifts.com have the same item at a better price."
5,Beautiful and erotic,"I have owned this CD for many years, and as friends hear it (particularly women), everyone wants a copy. It seems to be everyone's favorite to make love by."
3,Idealist perspective,"This book has many beautiful pictures and reads easily. In history making, everyone selects what he finds most important or interesting. In my opinion, this book is written with an overall idealist bias (which I disagree with, I am theist), and a leftist perspective in the section on politics. I was in particular disappointed but the very short treatment of Aquinas, whose philosophy is ""beyond the scope of this book."" I wish Copleston had written a shorter history next to his monumental work, so that it would compete with this present book."
2,POOR LIGHT,"Picture shows better lighting then there actually is-- the light bulbs are really small and do not put out that kind of light. Also, it wouldn't fit tightly around our umbrella pole--which is a standard one. I'd avoid this and look for something that puts out more light."
5,Tainted Sand,"Awesome Book!! I remember reading about this in the Bridgton, Maine newspaper.I couldn't put the book down until I finished it. I even calledin sick at work. I found out that Evora Jordan has another new book, a children's book, with a message for both children and adults, called 'Annie Love'. It's another great book, I'd rate it five stars also."
5,big praise for big apple,"This is a fantastic cd. What a surprise. An abundance of clever pop gems. Strong songwriting and exceptional vocals can be found here but the instrumentals peppered throughout are also terrific. Although this appears to be their debut, the happy ashtray website lists several cds in their back catalog. Can't wait to hear more. Great work."
2,Bic Ultra Round stic,"When I must use a pen I want it to give me clean lines.Since my last purchase was a box full, I have a lot of these things.They leak ink past the point and cause blotting on the paper.I have to keep a tissue on my desk and wipe the pen frequently.Even so, I can't write an entire line without blotting.I'll be looking for a better pen, next time."
2,Comes apart each time you pull the cap off,"EVERY time I pull the cap off of this pen, the grip part comes apart from the pen and tries to stay in the cap. So I have to grab the grip, pull it out, and put the pen back together. Couldn't they have made the parts of the pen STAY together???"
1,A Sham,The only reason it got one star from me is because 0 stars was not an option. At least the guy impersonating Ben E. King could sound a little like him. And the group impersonating The Drifters could at least wake up and try to sound like they like the music. The one saving factor is that it didn't cost all that much for the lesson learned.
1,Madacy sucks,Just stay away from any recordings from Madacy Records. What a sham. These do not even come close to the original recordings.
3,Not great...but does the job!,Milton is a good enough name in india when it comes to casseroles...but unlike other miltons that my mom used to use this one didnt have a good finish...BUt the thermal insulation in the product is great!...I have managed to make curds in it ..in winter..by pouring wamn milk and a spoon of danone...to put it to test...considering it made the curds in 6-8 hours...i think it maintained the termperature good enough. rest i used it for regular dinners mainly in winters as my foods cools down really fast...functionally..the product works for me..only if the finish of the black trim was better ..i would have given it 5 stars...its all quite pricey with the shipping...53$..so 1 star out for that too.
3,"fine, but not quite what I was expecting","Based on the picture and the description of ""stainless steel"" casserole, I expected this to be a bit more substantial. It looks and feels like a lightweight, plastic container.I used it this weekend as an insulator to make yogurt (the purpose for which I bought it) and it worked fine, so it did maintain the temperature.The main problem I have with it is that the lid is very hard to lock into place and once locked, it very hard to get back out. I am not sure if mine is just a dud, or if this model just has a poorly fitting lid-lock. None of the other reviews mentioned a problem with the lid locking into place, so maybe it is just mine."
4,Excellent,This product is excellent. Whenever I make Biriyani I transfer to this container. It stays real hot for 6 hours.If we use microwave for heating up the food becomes dry. But in Milton (this product) - this do not happen.Thanks to amazon for getting this product for me.
1,Way to go. Making fun of Russian Orthodox Priests....,"Horrible. The Death Defier short story takes 3 pages and then tells you what the vehicle is. Why not just say what it is and stop wasting time?My main problem is this somehow logic that Russian Orthodox priests are gay. They are allowed to marry. There is no need to attack them, As Mr. Bissell does. Nice job attacking those that can't defend themselves and are probably thinking...""whuh?""A book of feces."
1,Makes Zero Sense,"I understand the need to be creative, artistic and non-linear, but this move is a convoluted, sequential mess. After 90 minutes into it I was still confused...so I finished it and guess what, I'm still not sure! Makes zero sense! note: If you're a ""pure artist"" looking to explore the inner-workings of a creatively, obscure and tortured soul, then you should watch it. If not, NEXT!"
2,Only Likeable by the Most Pseudo of Pseudo-Intellectuals,"For all the post-modern ruminations this film mental-masterbates to, it ultimately lacks any real depth. Some people love to be flatter themselves by ""figuring out"" a movie like this, but the direct experience of watching it is tiresome and unsatisfying. Even the scenes that do work (e.g., it is funny for a character to be purchasing a house that is constantly on fire) are ruined by the director's ""aren't I clever,"" heavy-handed style.Really disappointing..."
2,"No, No, No...","After only a short while, I reached the limits of my intellectural interest, sometimes referred to as the ""BS Level."" I was insulted by the deliberate confusion of plot and ""stage settings."" I found the entire production to be infuriatingly overdone. The more detail that was supplied, the more I found myself not caring.I thought perhaps I hadn't been in the proper mood to have watched the film, so I gave it a second chance. It didn't work. I couldn't get past the first 30 minutes.To have paced the film to inteligibly absorb all the information being pushed upon the viewers, the film would have needed a couple more hours to eliminate some of the constant overlapping, which would have given me the time to sort out everything, without my frustration meter going into the red zone."
2,tedious and boring,we get the point already. it's a recurring theme in this guy's work. all of us are the directors of the movie of our own lives and everything that has ever happened to us can be internally debated and reimagined. one review said the movie is like david lynch meets woody allen and that's about right except it's not nearly as good as either and it's very long and boring. the movie is hard to get through. i had to watch it in 3 different sittings to finish it. that's very telling and a very bad sign for any movie. i guess i'm just not a fan of kaufman's work. sorry charlie.
1,I think someone is missing the point...,"...and it's not the viewers. While watching this movie I felt that Mr. Kaufman had watched INLAND EMPIRE, Brazil, and some Godard and decided it would be a great idea to make a movie with Lynch's verisimilitude, Gilliam's upbeat, cheerful tone, and Godard's tightly plotted barn-burner screenplays. In order to make the resulting mess his own, he added scatological humor and absurd pseudointellectual dialogue.It was incredible."
4,Bizarelly...awesome,"Confusing, but profound. Total dream-like in it's phantasmagoric exploration of memory an ideas. This is something you can watch over and over again and still get stuff out of it."
1,"Self-indulging, depressing, pretentious swill","I can't describe enough horrible things about this film! The cast is stellar, but the story just sinks down the film's worth. I don't mind if a movie is depressing but this one is unbearable! I got sick of it half-way through but stuck with it 'cause I thought it would improve, only to be greatly disappointed. This is the only film I think I've ever viewed where, after it was over, I honestly wish I could've traveled back in time to watch something else or do something better with my time. Filmmaker Charlie Kaufman here is producing some pretentious avant garde cinema that simply doesn't make the wanted memorable achievement mark, except maybe a Razzie nomination. Steer clear of this one! Unless you want what I got: that sad, overwhelming feeling of wishing you could get the past two hours of your life back."
1,Wow,"I have not seen a movie this bad since Robin Hood: Men in Tights. This was 2 hours of my life I'll never get back. I cannot believe I watched the whole thing. A rambling, self-indulgent, self-pitying piece of junk. Ugh."
4,Labyrinth of the mind a surreal odyssey,"""Synecdoche, New York"" represents a world that lies somewhere between fantasy and reality. An ailing director, Caden Cotard (Philip Seymour Hoffman) builds a replica of New York in a huge cavernous warehouse and instructs his actors live out constructed lives. He hires an actor to play himself, and others to play the people he knows. The staging of the play takes on a life of its own as the sets just keep getting bigger and bigger and more elaborate, until the fabricated New York begins to look every bit as real as a real city. And when the actors begin to intermingle with Cotard's real life the line between the play and real life becomes even more blurred.This is a fascinating movie that will frustrate some and stimulate others. Just sit back and enjoy this labyrinth from the mind of Charlie Kaufman (""Adaptation"", ""Being John Malkovich"")."
2,Not the best movie of the year!,"I was particularly irked to have a reviewer compare this film to Waiting for Godot, one of my favorite plays. The actors are, undeniably, excellent. However,this absurdist screenplay never made me feel anything but dread -- fearing that this descent into a surrealistic whirlpool would never, ever end. Throughout, I kept wondering what kept me from turning off the TV. What could I possibly have seen in this madness that kept me watching? I wanted to find something positive that kept me there....but I think I was imagining that somehow the audience would be let in on some big secret. That did not happen and I have to say that this is on my list of least favorite movies, along with Leaving Las Vegas, which had been at the very top of my list until now."
1,Awful Awful Horrible Movie...,"I've seen a lot of movies in my day, but this is 2 hours of my life I'll never get back and I'm pissed about it. I mean really pissed. STAY AWAY from this movie. Will Ferrell's The Lost World has more cinematic value and will give you better entertainment for your buck... and that movie was the 2nd worst movie of all time.Long story short. This movie sucked."
2,Less Than the Sum of its Parts,"Fellini's 8 1/2 crossed with Tom McCarthy's Remainder, engrafted onto the life and vision of a mediocre regional stage director. Need one say that the results are less than gripping? Drab to the point of sordidness, the film seeks release in familiar bizarreries and winds up looking desperate. Philip Seymour Hoffman mumbles and shuffles his way through the central role; the other actors have too little screen time to leave an imprint. The longer speeches, meant to be resonantly summative, are as platitudinous as the final voice-over in Benjamin Button."
5,"Amazing Film, changed the way I watched and felt about movies.","When I saw this movie in theatres, I didn't appreciate what I was watching. This film is immensely thought provoking and although everyone may not see it the same, if you truly want to be ""challenged"" by a film, this is one for you. I have watched it at home, and it is brilliant. The original score enhances the feel of this movie as well."
2,OUCH!,"OKAY--I GET IT ALREADY! This is a painfully confusing film with fine performances throughout. If you are bored with the linear and crave complexity with symbols thrown at you for little reason but to further confuse, go for it!! God, I don't care about the characters or the plot in this movie at all. Is it real or is it...? Is it worth the trouble? Maybe, but not for me or my wife, who begged me to stop the movie half way through. Not me--I'm a masochist."
2,"A few wonderful ideas lost in a long, gray movie","I loved ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", so I had high hopes for this movie. There are some really interesting ideas and images in this movie, but it just didn't work for me as a movie. I found it long and depressing, and at times disturbing(poor Olive!) I don't think I understood everything, but I have absolutely no interest in watching it again to figure it out."
1,Ridiculously confusing mess,"This starts out alright, but rather quickly veers into a maze of stories within stories, muddled transitions, confusing lines of plot development, what seems like the old play-within-a-play device, not to mention characters who we never develop the slightest interest in. Charlie Kaufman, the self-absorbed screenwriter who got way too much credit for movies like ""Eternal Sunshine,"" directed this and got way too ambitious. We simply don't care about the main character, Philip Seymour Hoffman playing a director, nor do we ever develop any sympathy for anyone else here. The movie tries to cover a long time period, I guess, which just ends up being another over-the-top element. In the end, I have no idea what this sprawl was about. If I want to work this hard, I would get a job. For entertainment, I would look elsewhere."
1,Painful experience,"Muddled and painful to watch. Actors self indulgent orgy of experimentation into shock, without any redeeming value. Wish I could get the time back."
1,What was that?,"Second film in a row I've watched where the main actor has his head down the entire movie setting a depressing tone throughout. The entire movie seemed completely random. E.g. in one scene he's dying, the next scene he's fine. I watched it long enough to see if any of the randomness would be resolved such as waking up from a dream or delusion, but it didn't. Guess I'm artiste enough to understand it. Reminds me of a famous painter who randomly throws a bunch of paint on the canvas then the critics come along and create an intricate review."
1,"Loved Adaptation, John Malkovitz sp? and Eternal Sunshine","But Synecdote, New York was a total bummer. It made no sense. All these long existential reviews are gonna mislead buyers. I certainly will say that NO ONE should watch this alone, especially if you are in a bad way. It totally ruined my night. Don't buy it unless you are extremely happy to begin with and even then, I would never recommend anything this sloppy, long and confused."
2,"Leaked, damaging my stuff","Pros: If nothing goes wrong, NIMH type batteries are known for being an excellent rechargeable, capable of going for hundreds of charges.Cons: I bought lots of these, and many leaked, partially breaking all three of my photography external flashes, which are $220 each. :( (I had to sell the flashes for a lot less than they were worth.)"
1,Batteries don't hold charge,"Warning, these batteries don't work. They don't hold a charge for more than a day or two.Also, the company itself (CTA) is kind of sketchy. Their support email currently has an auto-reply up which says ""Due to the upcoming holiday season, we're experiencing an increase in e-mail volume."" Well, Christmas was 2 months ago!"
5,Simply The Best Performance,"I heard several versions of The Four Seasons until I decided to buy it, and this recording was exactly what finally made me move and go get inmediatly this well known work. This version has an enormous energy. The sound is great, the speed onf the reading is a little bit fast, but that gives the performance part of tis power, and that is usually something you get with Abbado and the LSO, powerfull versions. Kremer is great too, even though I think it is Abbado and the orchestra what gives to this recording most of its beauty. After I bought it, I have heard other versions, and no one ever has been as good as this one. This is the recording of The Four Seasons you must have in your collection."
2,This is Argerich not Chopin.,"Argerich is probably one of the ten greatest pianists of the century, but not with Chopin's Preludes. She manages to strip every shred of dignity from this music. It's not boring, but Chopin should not be played as though it's Rachmaninoff. I'd recommend purchasing Moravec, Pires, Lortie, Cortot, Arrau, Pollini, Perlemuter, Rubinstein, or many other pianists, including Zayas ahead of this."
1,Negatively Bland,"Argerich manages to remove all passion from these masterpieces. Every prelude was performed similairly; boring, dry, and lacking dynamic. It seems as if her recording was either rushed or her interpretation of the text is skewed. ..."
2,"If you like this, check out Kissin","Read my review of Evgeny Kissin's CD of the Chopin Preludes and substitute ""Argerich"" where it says ""Kissin."""
4,"A worthy account, despite what ARG says.","Most other versions are indeed ""boring"" by comparison to Ms. Argerich's. Again, however, Ms. Argerich's impulsive playing of Chopin necessarily lacks in some places a certain control. The Zayas account, on the other hand, is both interesting and controlled. It is with the Zayas recording in mind (Music & Arts 1006) that I judge this one to be worth only 4 stars."
3,Little attention to detail and nuance,"I don't know why Argerich is so adored. Playing everything fast and loud doesn't constitute a great performance. I know the Chopin Preludes inside and out, and although Argerich has a nice intuition and a sense of passion, she pays little attention to the details and nuances that are so superb in Chopin. It seems that she was so eager to display technical mastery that the poetic sensibilities of the music are lost."
4,Best of the Bunch - but needs better Critiques,"I purchased 3 College Essay books (100 Successful College Application Essays, 50 Successful Harvard Application Essays, and Essays That Worked), and have the following comments... I believe that the Harvard book has the best suggestions on how to write an essay, along with the best commentary/critique. However, the essays are a bit too polished. I think for 90% of prospective college students, their essays would be more like those in and patterned like those in Essays That Worked. For varied ideas on essays, the 100 Successful book gives some good ideas, but I believe many of the essays to be subpar. I did each book to have some interesting general reading, especially if one likes ""short stories""... or if one is interested in 17 & 18 year olds, and what goes thru their minds."
5,The Kingdom of God,I found this book to be a very readable yet scholarly writing of the history of God's people from the time of Egypt to the present. I have read no other books that are so comprehensive in their dealings with this subject. An excellent book which should be in any Christians library.
4,Solid Text,"Gave an easy to follow theology that is sound with scripture. The ""already - not yet"" presentation of God's Kingdom flowed in an understandable presentation. I also appreciated the applicability of Bright's ideas to the Christian life."
4,pretty interesting,This book has good info on Israel and the Old Testament and New Testament and how everything is related.
3,"Good, but one dimensional","Samuel Ramey is undoubtedly one of the finest and most versatile opera singers of his generation. However, these songs do not show his voice off at his best. One of Ramey's main faults is a lack of variety and vocal colour which is ABSOLUTELY needed in a song recital. This lack of colouring means that most of the songs come out sounding the same. The other major concern is that Mr Ramey's vibrato is quite pronounced. Most opera singers can get away with this when singing with an orchestra, but when he just has piano accompaniment it is much more noticeable. Still, it is good to have a recording of some of these lesser known songs and it is still an enjoyable cd."
3,Regular,"Para ser Claudio Abbado italiano y uno de los mejores directores de opera en la actualidad, uno esperaría más de este disco. Esta bien pero nada más..Pssst. Bernstein/New York, Toscanini/NBC"
2,So So light,"A friend of mine bought this light and loves it. He recommended it to me. So i was in need and thought it would come in handy to have so i purchased the item. When it came time for me to actually use it, it didn't work like it was supposed to. It had some faulty wiring. The white connectivity light worked, the green ground light worked, but the red power light would only work when if you moved or bent the wires and even then it wasn't really accurate. After messing with it trying to get it work, i couldn't get the power light to come on even when connected to a direct power source. I want to try again but dont want to spend the money only to be disappointed again."
2,OVERRATED FOR THE PRICE,OVERRATED FOR THE PRICE YOU PAID. A $5 VOLT CHECKER WILL DO THE SAME JOB FOR A LOT LESS.THE ONLY LED THAT WORKS IS THE WHITE ONE THAT INDICATES 12 DC VOLTS.
2,Wiring connection faulty...,The wiring connection on mine is faulty. I had to twist and bend the base of the tester to get it to function properly. I'm going to buy a better computer-safe test light.
1,aniowachick,"Dorothy Carey by James R. Beck, is supposedly a story about Dorothy. Instead Beck spends much/most of his words and description about William Carey, Dorothy's husband. Dorothy was an uneducated lady who Beck married, one would hope out of love. Though little of love is demonstrated by Carey. Beck details Carey's absence in the home, so he could pursue his own pursuits. Did Carey feel his work more important than the family God had given him? It would seem at least the family was very low on Carey's priority list.Beck seems to take the paragraph known about Dorothy and stretch it into a work, in which he can openly say, ""Who knows what happened? He then creates suppositions about what might have happened. His handling of the topic is one of navel nit picking, and not informative though according to him, Beck, he is kinder to his subject than most other biographers."
3,a glimpse at the early Jung....,....back in the word association days in which he did his best to fit psyche into the mold of Newtonian science. Outdated except as a history of Jung's early work and glimpses at later developments.
2,Frisbee,"This CD is good for the causal listener - but after hearing Dinu Lipatti play Mozart's Piano Concert No 21, I can't listen to this. For No. 21, the music (orchestral and piano) is too slow - technically the playing is spot on, but the timing feels off and there is extra flourishes in some of orchestral parts that seemed disconnected or seemed to not belong. I listened to No 21 first and gave it three full ear shots and did not bother listening to No. 20 as I threw the CD's out the car window. I am not sure if it is the conductor, the player, the orchestra or a combination of it all. It's probably me..... but I am not recommending this CD.Maybe my opinion would be different I had listened to this first with no other variations.....no....b/c I just recently came across Dinu Lipatti... I bought this in 2004....."
3,Not quite what I expected.,"Once again I got suckered into thinking a book was going to give me more technique and less in the way of patterns. I had wanted to know more about actual conversion methods, and this book didn't quite hit my mark. However, for a novice or intermediate crafter, I think this book would be okay."
2,I wanted to convert my own patterns and it did not do that.,I was looking for a book to teach me how to convert my own patterns to crochet. It was also misrepresenting the look of the stiches. I thought that the crochet would look like knitting.
5,Crocheting a Knitted look,I've always wanted to learn to knit and it seemed I always ended up with something other than a knitted look. This book will help me get the look I want and will make great gifts in crochet
3,ESOTERIC,"The book discusses numbers and their meanings, Animism, and how religions with a Good/Bad structure (Judaism, Islam, Christianity) are Polytheistic, not Monotheistic. The author lists the ancient Egyptian ""42 Negative Confessions,"" which appear to be what the Judeo-Christian ""Ten Commandments"" are based on. The author offers an interesting, even if minority, viewpoint and lists himself as a source reference along with only a handful of other authors. The book introduces Baladi Egyptians."
2,ancient Egypt,This book isnt that easy to understand and alot of it is pure speculation. I recommend it only as a reference book.
4,I wonder how it's going to come out like.....,"This game is really cool! You get to explore many levels and defeat the menace Ripto again! Spyro can now even use tornadoes and have Phoenix Vision!The downside is, that it's pretty short.When it comes out, First borrow, Buy later."
4,Spyro...?,"This game is really fun up to one part where I am having problems being able to glide across. I know, it is pretty pitiful, so please write a reveiw telling me how!"
3,blah,"Same old spyro again and again... All of the spyro games have a similar storyline: save the DRAGONS, save the DRAGON eggs, save the DRAGONflies. You're always saving something and fighting similar enemies. It just gets old. This game is one of the best though."
4,Cezanne's Composition,This book is for anyone wanting/needing to know how Cezanne came up with his unique compositions. His methods are examined. His thoughts that were conducted to others throught letters and recall are examined. There is a lot of controversy over Cezanne's use of perspective. The author has photographed the exact locations of Cezanne's paintings and made diagrams with explanations for the reader to know exactly how the artist worked. I found this book to be very interesting.
3,Pages misplaced,"The book itself is good, but pages 17 - 32 were misplaced after page 48, it is too trouble and time consume to mail back to exchange or refund. Books like this should not sell to customers."
4,great game,I got this in the mail in a very short time. It is fun to play and was a great price. I would recommend this to everyone.
1,Who needs data when you have a rich fantasy life?,"Based on the absurd notion that learning to read is the same as learning to speak a language; and therefore explicit instruction is not needed. Whole language nonsense like this, pushed by education professors and bought by gullible teachers and school principals, helps to explain why a substantial proportion of this generation of students is illiterate and does so poorly on all subjects (math, science) that require reading competence. One day (hopefully in the not too distant future) we will see whole language as a nightmare from which we are just beginning to awaken."
4,telescoping Martin house pole,"Very heavy and durable. However, fit inside each tube is problematic and not perfect. Tends to hang up until worked loose. Some what difficult to assemble and not easy to manage. Almost requires two people for assembly. Must be mounted in a deep hole with a poured concrete support. Once the Martin house is mounted and the pole raised it is very stable."
3,Not Exactly as advertised,"I ordered this cap gun for my young nephew for Christmas; he asked for an all metal cap gun. I ordered roll caps for the gun, since the description says it fires roll caps.I was disappointed when I received the cap gun. The barrels of the gun are plastic. The handle and stock are a light-weight wood, and the trigger assembly and hammers are metal. This is not all steel and wood as the description implies.The cap gun does not fire roll caps. There is nowhere on the gun to load roll caps. From another site, I discovered that it should use the straight line plastic caps. If you can find these caps, they work very well with this cap gun.Other than that, the gun was a hit with my nephew. He loves the double barrel and slight delay between one barrel firing and then the next firing. He does not mind that it is not exactly what he asked for; he just thinks thinks it is a lot of fun."
3,cap gun,"the caps don't fire right with the way it is designed.for a toy it is ok to go play with but don""t expect to use the caps while playing"
2,not worth the price,"It is a cute handbag. But too easy to get dirty and you can do nothing with that. I tried to clean it, but messed it up. And I can not longer use it."
3,Bucket,I got this for my husband as part of a gift set I made using it as a beer bucket. My only real complaint was the sticks stuck to the outside of it... I could never fully get them off! i tried but they were stuck and tore and left the gross residue and shredded. Besides that I was great though you get pretty much what you pay for.
1,Use with caution,"This book is well intentioned but has some flaws that the reader must be aware of. There are quite a few minor errors which can be attributed to a bad editor. Here are two that are worth mentioning: a) the chapter on indulgences has to be ignored. The author confuses indulgence with forgiveness. b) In page 96 where it says ""Jesus' place in the Godhead"" is ambiguously phrased and seems to indicate that the Son is like a portion that fits in a ""place"" of the Most Holy Trinity.Save for these minor flaws the book is very useful."
3,"Great pictures, but a little false information.","There's some false information in this book. But it's made up with great photos! I recomend the ""Official *NSYNC Book"". Now THAT is a 5 star rating."
5,"The book is phat, smooth, and dope all together!!!","Hey *N SYNC fans... You will love this book!!! You get it all and then some when you read it. Scoop (Lance), Bounce (Justin), Phat-one (Joey), Crazy (Chris), and Mr. Sleepy (J.C.) all have there own little chapters that tell you all you need to know about them and there past lives. I LOVE James Lance Bass and they have close up pictures of his gorious geen eyes and beautiful smile... you can almost see his glowing personality through his eyes. This book is full of glossy color pictures and slammin facts!!! If your a smart *N SYNC fan you will buy this book!!! C-ya on later dayz!!! Peace and hair grease!!! Stay *NSYNC!!! If your as big of an *N SYNC fan (especialy Lance) then feel free to E-mail me!!!"
5,I think the book helped me learn more about the 5 guys I luv,"Hey Yal! What's up? I just wanted to tell you all how much I luv Nsync and how much I luv the book it was great. The reason why I luved it so much is because it really tells youwhat you want to know. Now Justin,Jc,Chris,Joey, and Lance aren't just HOTT and talented but i learned from the book that they are sweet,down to earth,and every word that describes great!!!!!!!!!"
4,What is that mountain range?,"If you are a hiker or camper or backroader or are looking for a place to get away from it all, this atlas can certainly help. All major and minor mountain ranges are identified, and many of the roads that access those ranges can be found. Keep this book in your Jeep!"
4,Benchmark AZ road & rec Atlas,the product was fine. it got to me in approprate time. i hate being bugged by Amazon to write a review.
5,Benchmark maps are the best,"Benchmark are bsolutely the best road atlases out there. I have the AZ, UT, OR, and CA maps that I have purchased for trips (I use my CA one all the time, but I live here) and find them invaluable. I can always find my way when lost, and they really do a great job of showing detail that you wouldn't expect, even in metro areas. They show the most random and remote Forest Service or BLM roads, and points of interest on those roads that you would otherwise need specialty maps to see. If there's a dirt road or otherwise going there, these maps show it. Highly recommended!"
1,Very not worth the money,"These Benchmark Atlas books are not any better then the Free Atlas you can get from your insurance companies. I bought and returned all of them for the western states.I was hoping to get more detailed (back roads, etc) maps, also GPS coordinates etc. No in these, Not worth the cost of shipping."
4,.,"For some reason this is the Nick Cave disc I listen to least (of the discs I have), but when I really think about it, I'm not sure why. Probably because the first 2 tracks aren't especially memorable (which isn't to say they're altogether bad.) But Sorrow's Child, The Weeping Song, and especially the Ship Song, are all excellent. The latter half of the disc is hit and miss with me. This is just about as dark and melodramatic as your typical Nick Cave, but the musical tonality is much softer. Not a NC album I typically jump for, but well worth it, for the songs I mentioned at the very least."
4,would give it 5 stars but it his not his best,"I love Nick Cave's music, whether with the Bad Seeds or Birthday Party. Tne more I listen to him, the more I am convinced that he is one of the MAJOR figures in the history of rock. He has it all: great presence, commanding and capable voice, powerful instrumental backup, truly orignial lyrics and enough variety in his music to make you want to hear everything that he has done. The Good Son's boasts a number of piano-driven pieces that make this CD from the others, but the songs do not rank up there with his greats. Nevertheless, do not hesitate to get this CD if you like Nick Cave. He is a giant and I cannot wait for his new CD Nocturama to come out."
5,Finest dog comb available,"I have a 14 lbs. Westie and this comb is perfect for eliminating matting problems. Well made and fairly priced, thanks to Amazon. Anyone who would buy this product in a retail pet store is throwing money away. Satisfied customer to the max."
3,Big!,"I wanted to find an everyday watch that also looked polished and elegant. After seeing ""too many"" watches, I saw this one and thought I had found excactly what I was looking for. I ended up returning it because in actuallity, it is so much larger looking then in the picture. That makes it not only masculine but not as attractive as in the picture. If you like really big watches though, it is a classy design."
4,Reminiscent of the Sten series,"Excellent work, best of Mr. Bunch's work since the Sten series with Alan Cole. Much more gritty and realistic approach to his heroes, written by someone who seems to know what really goes on in covert operations. I found the ranking a little too cute, since the structure seemed the same as today, with just an alien sounding name. I think it would have been as effective and easier to keep up with if the ranks had been in english. Excellent work, could not put the book down. His humor had me laughing out loud at times!"
4,"Good characters, good story, bit of a bumpy read however","I initially read this book, part one of a series, in paperback a few years back, and decided to grab the Kindle version recently, as most of the authors I concentrate on are currently out of new material. The book is definitely still enjoyable the second time around - it's been long enough that I've forgotten all but the overall outline of the series- but while the characters and story are still enjoyable, it's a bit too much like many recent movies have become to give it 5 stars - a bit too much jittery hand-held camera and fast cut edits, but in a book rather than on screen."
2,Average,"The Last Legion: Book One is the first book I've read by Chris Bunch, so I really can't compare this to his other works. However, standing alone, this is an average piece of SF. Things are said and never brought up again. Yes, I understand that the Book One part means that there will be more, but there were too many questions left dangling. The writer's style makes this book very easy to read, so I found myself reading it very quickly. None of the characters grabbed me though. If I see Book Two on the shelves, I may pick it up. But I won't be waiting with baited breath."
2,Bit of a let down,"I loved the Sten series and I found the premise of this one interesting. But.....Sadly it seemed to lack everything that made the Sten series so good, perhaps the influence of Chris Cole was missed too much.Boring characters, confusing and dull adversaries and, in my case, a bored reader.I wont be bothering with the rest of the series...."
3,"Violent military science fiction, unflinchingly told.","Chris Bunch is masterful at creating a universe that is vivid and full of potential for military battles, spying and intrigue. It shows mankind at it's very worst--as violent and mindless automatons where even the heroes (anti-heroes?) are stereotypical losers with very few redeeming characteristics.Testosterone laden and full of meticulously arranged military strategy, the tale is unflinchingly and well told in a style which has shown the author's growth from earlier books. If you are a fan of military sci-fi, and enjoy authors like Rick Shelley and Gordon Dickenson, then this would probably be more to your liking than mine."
3,Interesting plot,"This book was ok. I liked the premise and the plot. But the characters were a little thin. I never really found much to identify with any of them. Also, the slang and culture in the book seemed to made up and forced. Because of this, it was hard to read at some points. I'll probably read the next one in the series, but if there isn't much improvement, I might stop there."
2,Another weak rap artist!,"These g-unit people are horrible. Banks is cool but this Tony Yayo person is wack. Tryin to be like Parrish Smith from EPMD. Never! His g-unit partner 50 cent is a disgrace on the mic. He just mumbles words over beats. These cats are not creative. Who cares about your ice , yours cars , your women , or your big homes. The content of this music is weak. It is a shame kids have to listen to such crap rap. Will somebody please call Kane , Kool G Rap , KRS-ONE , Rakim , or Cool J. These are true mc's who can flow and have a phat stage show. They don't need 30people on stage with them to take the heat off. The 80's rapperswould eat Tony Yayo's lunch! I hope Tony and 50 take their rymesto the rap rehab!"
4,Game Over,another banger from G-Unit....takin over the game. Can't wait to hear all the music they put out after signing MOBB and MOP this stuff is just gonna keep gettin better.
4,Almost A Classic,Despite what everyone is sayin on here this cd was almost considered to be a classic and all tho it is not its falls jus short of that mark. It has plenty of bangas and a few for the hoes too.
1,Prime example of G-Unit being garbage,"With the exception of MOP and Mobb Deep (whose next album will probably be horrible) G-Unit is the crappiest thing going on in rap music right now, and Tony Yayo is definitely no exception. Tony Yayo lacks any talent and really has no appeal about him what-so-ever. I thought america was over the whole fake thug movement, but intelligence doesn't really sell too well. Rappers like Talib Kweli, Common, Mos Def, Jurrassic 5, Dilated Peoples should get more recognition but they don't talk about guns and robbing people and other ignorant topics. Don't support raps evil empire, they have a lot of people fooled, hopefully you aren't one of them.The Zapper"
1,GGGGGG-Unot,"This album by far has some of the worst lyrics I have ever heard. The only song that was worth listening to was ""Drama Setter"" and that was because Eminem & Obie Trice was on the song. Yayo make 50 look like Nas (and that's not a compliment). G-Unot is garbage and Game is basically eating these lame ass rappers lyrically by himself."
2,G-g-g-U not!,"Terrible!A lot of G-units albums have the same beatsnow. Most of the songs in this album have the similar basson massacre and hunger for more. So to all theG-unit fans out there, trust me they're not gonna last.G-units won't be around for a long time. 2 out of5 for this album. Songs are good but as i said, it'sall pretty much the same! If u're a g-unit fan,Go crazy and get it then crank it up in your car stereothen people will think your cool since G-unit iscurrently the hype. But I'd rather settle for rapperswho puts a lot of meaning to their songs. There's more into rapping than guns and drugs."
2,Thoughts of a Dumbass,"This album is just poor in every sense: poor lyrics, poor and repetitive production beats, and simply poor songs. This G-Unit member simply rushed his debut, barely a couple of months of out prison, and it simply goes to show that this g-unit member is simply the weakest link in the g-unit crew. Some good songs include the R&B; track 'Project Princess' and 'We Don't Give a F***' and 'So Seductive,' but mostly all of the other songs are easily forgettable. Songs like G-S***, and other songs i've already forgotten make this album a no buy.Someone please get Tony Yayo a voice tuner or something, his attempt at hitting high notes in 'Eastside Westside' is just simply horrendous.If you enjoy week tracks, a very stale voice and songs that sound like they are still on the cutting room floor, then you'd enjoy this, but if not, then stay far away from it. The G-Unit label is supposed to be an icon of wicked beats and smart rhymes, but in this case, its just simply false advertising."
3,Tony Yayo,"First up, if you wantin the best rap album in history, DO NOT pick this up. It is not horrendous to the point it makes me want to die but its not great. It shouldve went platinum, yes but no further. Im so high is one of the best songs ive ever heard. By far the best on the album. As others may have said ""Tattle Teller"" Is ridiculous. Live by the gun is a nice track. So seductive is great, nice club banger. Love My Style uses a sample from Britney Spears Toxic as moronic as that sounds but its a pretty good track. Curious with Joe is Mostly singing, not one of my personal fav.s Drama Setter is simply amazing. The next single ""I Know You Dont Love Me"" Is kinda dumb, 50s boring-ass hook sucks. project princess is decent. Dear Suzie is Fckin stupid. I didn't buy the album but I burned it. I suggest you do the same."
3,It wasn't What I Thought?,This cd lacks on some tracks but drama setter is probally the most hardest track that tony yayo did if you think i am a hater or a idiot im not i just think this cd is not worth it to me but some good tracks are on it!IntroHomicide 5/5It Is What It Is 5/5+Tattle Teller 3.5/5So Seductive 5/5EastSide WestSide 2.5/5Drama Setter 5/5++We Don't Give A f*** 4.5/5Pimpin' 3/5Curious 4.5/5I'm So High 5/5++Love My Style 3.5/5Project Princess 2.5/5G-Sh** 5.5+++++++++I Know You Don't Love Me 3/5Dear Suzie 1/5Live By The Gun 2/5this cd is ok but its up to you if you want this i know hardcore g-unit fans will like me but hey yayo's HOME!!!
1,Buy or Download?,"Tony Yayo - Thoughts of a Predicate Felon. Some would say it's good, some would say it was medicore, some would say it doesn't exist it was so bad. Its not that I don't like Tony Yayo It's just that album was a dissapointment to many G-Unit fans and Record Sales wise was a flop. The Album had a few good tracks such as ""We Don't Give A Fu*k"" with 50 Cent, Olivia & Lloyd Banks, and ""Pimpin"", to me these were very catchy tracks that would have otherwise made decent videos. ""Live By The Gun"" was also a good track which was a raw track which is becoming a rare thing for G-Unit. Aside from these three tracks Tony's Yayo's album - Thought's of A Predicate Felon was a flop. I would not suggest buying it unless you are a real G-Unit fan other than that it could a decent download. Tony Yayo I hope you do better on your next album and next time think before you speak!"
1,"Collector's Edition or Not, the Album Still SUCKS!!!","Tony Yayo's over-hyped debut has shown that he is the weakest link on G-Unit and a disgrace to the group. The only songs worth listening to are the ones where other people helped his weak flow:05 - So Seductive (Feat 50 Cent)06 - Eastside Westside07 - Drama Setter (Feat. Eminem And Obie Trice)08 - We Dont Give A F*** (Ft Lloyd Banks, Olivia, & 50 Cent)10 - Curious (Ft. Joe)15 - I Know You Dont Love Me (Ft. 50, Young Buck & Lloyd Banks)That's 6/17 tracks that are good! That shows that Dre needs to start helping out on G-Unit's albums more (Massacre could have been better as well) and quit worrying about Game. What the hell were they thinking sampling Britney Spears' Toxic song on track 12- Love My Style?? Not only is the song played out & girly but it also shows the lack of creativity used on most of the album."
2,whack,"I'm an avid tony yayo fan, but this album just didn't cut it. maybe its just trying to commercialize in the rap game and having pressure. i don't know. but i listened to most of his mixtapes and this album sounds nothing like them. Hopefully his next album will be way better. a few songs are good to listen to. I would think, coming out of prison you would have a lot to talk about, but ""so seductive"" being your first single?? come on. i am not a hater but just listen to the album and then listen to the gunit mixtapes and you will see what i mean.rating C-"
1,Tony Mayonaise,"on a serios note though....this really is 1 of the worst albums made in the last year or so, it's just pointless and ah it just isnt keepable, love songs are what they diss ja rule about and g-unit are full of it, i personally don't mind that stuff but that isn't right, they portray themselvez as gangsta all over but there nothing and not even good rappers, i actually was looking forward to this......."
1,Wish I Could Give It Zero Stars,"This album sucks...Tony Yayo is boring and can't rap, nobody should buy this album...Go get Kanye's album, Kanye's album is the hottest rap album of this year next to Common's since he produced that one..."
2,I wasted my money...damn,"Only reason I get it 2 stars is because of some of the beats.Makes me wonder how someone whose been in jail not have much of a good story to tell and is too busy making $h!+ songs like ""So Seductive""He cant sing, his flow is trash, delivery is poor, he cant keep up with the beats, his choruses suck (for Christ sakes stop singing like 50). Yayo is worse than 50. He had a spark when he started but wtf this was a rushed album...."
1,TONY YAYO STINKS LIKE BOLOGNA!!,"tony yayo's cd is probably the ugliest one i ever heard in my ""13"" years livin. I Love TOny Braxton!!"
1,Absolute Garbage,"I can't express my disbelief with words. How on earth does anybody think this guy is good? He has got to be the worst rapper I've ever heard. His lyrics and his flow are plain bad. Banks album sucked too, but at least his lyrics were pretty good and his voice is really tight too. Buck's and Game's CDs were the best of the group. And can somebody please tell me what the deal is with Yayo when he raps? What is he doing when he's shaking his hand in front of his mouth??? This clown seriously makes himself look retarded. I am going to be so upset if this piece of trash does well and takes away from sales of Kanye's Late Registration. The ONLY tight song is the one with good rappers Obie Trice (where's his sophomore album?) and Eminem... Please do not support Tony Yayo!!! We owe it to him to let him know that he really really really sucks ass."
1,G unit's hit rock bottom!!!,"Wow, I can't believe this is the guy the've been waiting for to get out of jail... for what?? his first solo effort is definately not what carries g-unit. yayo fails to keep the crowd going. 1 thing 50 and g-unit need to understand is that everybody can't be an artist and yayo has proved this. sorry but if I could give it no stars I would. go buy that Kanye west, you won't be dissappointed."
2,Garbage,I'll give him 2 stars for trying the CD itself is horrible. Dont buy this unless you want to waste money on bad music. Get Kanye's CD alot better then this garbage.
1,Tony Yayo Used To Have It,Tony YaYo USed To Be So HArd Before He Went To Jail I THink They Took His Manhood He's Really gay now U USed TO Have It Yayo
2,"It's Okay.. Get ""Game"" Album","I should've listened to what everyone else was saying. This album is by far one of the worst albums. Your a grown man singing about "" You a Tattle-Teller"" man... no words could describe how foolish you sound. Espically that Head shaking thing you do?! Actually I'm stupid because I bought this album! I wasted 5 dollars on this cd even though it's bootlegged. There are some good songs on this CD like Drama Setter, Pimpin (Kind of stupid but it's okay), Curious, and I know you don't love me. Then there's those songs that make you go wdf? Like, Eastside Westside, Tattle Teller, and Dear Suzie. For those of you who haven't gotten this CD Just go get it bootlegged. It's actually good enough for you to download. But delete it off your computer A.S.A.P. after you burned it on a disc cause the Gunit people may tap into your computer and put all this G-UNIT garbage and when someone sends you a IM its going to go GGGGGUUNNNIITTT!"
1,"ME SO ON FIRE!! ME FEELIN' HOT, HOT, HOT!!!!! - tony yayo","this album is the ugliest album fo' eva. fo' sho' i can rhyme better than that foo' and i ain't talkin about no sunday stew! Man i even got my mama tryin to call yayo and telling him he's not COOL! HE SUCKS LIKE DALMATIONS! I HATE DALMATIONS!!HAAAAA!!! YEA! i can read and write better than tony yayo!! He ain't the talk of NEW YORK, more like the Talk of LOSERVILLE!!! HAHAHA I'M HALARIOUS!!! PLEASE ORDER MORE FRIES, THANK YOU YAYO!!p.s. YAYO I DON'T LIKE UR FACE, AND UR ALBUM ILL GIVE YOU 0-STARS"
2,OH PLEASE!!!!,"Man, I am pissed off on this album. Why the hell does Tony Yayo deserve his own album? Every time a G-Unit album comes out, he's paying dues in the pen, man get it together. This is less of a review as it really is a dis. He ain't even that good of a rapper. If you even consider buying this album, check this. ALL THE SONGS SOUND EXACTLY THE SAME!!! Basically haunting piano mellodies and a cheap synth every now and then. In fact the only thing that you can really look forward to is the single, ""So Seductive"", which is just a cheap rip off of ""On Fire"" and ""Candy Shop"". Save your money. Don't contribute to this G-Unot soldier. This isn't a dis to G-Unit. Its a dis the worst rapper on there, TONY YAYO. Yeah Tony Yayo's finally out of jail, but maybe he sould go back."
4,YAYOS HOME!!!!,"This album is hot.We have not heard that much from Yayo because he has been in jail.He has the ability to make tracks for everyone.If you are into hardcore Gangster Rap or if you like the Club Bangers.He has colaberations with 50 Cent,Lloyd Banks,Young Buck,Olivia,Eminem,Obie Trice, and Joe.This album is definitly going to do good.G-Unit is going to be around for a long time.I'm glad they got rid of The Game because he was always hating on 50.He thinks it's all about him and he thinks because he did good with record sales that he is number 1.Anyways Yayo prooved himself with this album.GOOD JOB!!GGGGGG-UNIT!"
2,This album is a flop !,"Yo this album is wack and most of the songs are not very good .The only song I like is So seductive with 50 cent now that's a bangin track . On 300 bars and runnin ,Game said he'll bet 10 G's Yayo would flop and he was right on the money . Hey I'm starting to like this cd We don't give a f#ck about you is hot !!"
1,www.sportofdiatraction.com,"Well, believe it or not, Tony Yayo's album is a flop, in terms of record sales. I can't believe it. I thought for sure that rap fans were ready & waiting to hear about how another guy is a gangsta, sells drugs, and treats women like pets. I'm shocked...I can't believe that his gimmick of shaking his hand 3 inches from his face, back & forth for 10 seconds, didn't catch on with the youth. I was ready to rank the ""Hand-to-Face Shake"" right up there with the Hoola-Hoop, the Macarena, Cassidy's Hustla Dance, & Shake your Laffy-Taffy in the top 5 gimmicks of the modern era. I actually have to stop this review right now, because I'm a bit overwhelmed that this concept didn't take off."
1,Waste of money and time,"Let's just put it like this: he has a song that starts with the Britney Spears ""toxic"" beat, and he's a gangsta??! From what hood?! LOL He's wack. And when he sings, it's even WORSE!!! Whoever buys his CD is so gay, they need to get off his nuts. Oh and also, that thing with his hand he does to check for his bad breath: NO, NO!"
2,yayo go back to prison,"Yayo can't hold up an album by himself. He has no ability to write a song beyond a 3rd graders vocabulary. Take the track ""Homicide"", a decent song but yayo manages to ruin it with some awful writing on the song. His voice is all over the place in terms of tone, sometimes just sounding awful. The best parts of the album are the appearences of Banks, Buck, Em, and Obie trice.Best songs: Drama Setter(feat Eminem & Obie Trice)I'm so High(commercial cut but good beat and ok writing)Live By the GunThe R&B; tracks (Curious, Project Princess) don't appeal to me but are better than most of the other songsTattle teller is ok but sounds like an elementary song when it comes to the chorus. same with ""Homicide""Worst: Love My Style(smaples Britney Spears toxic 'nuff said)"
1,tony yayo should run!!!!!,omg i cant belive tony yayo actually dropped this album its garbage its bad enough game killed him on all of game's mixtape's but he still came out tony should have stayed cramped up in the closet like his homosexuality
2,Not A Very Good Debut...,"Tony Yayo's ""Thoughts of a Predicate Felon"" suffers from the fact that Tony Yayo simply doesn't know who he is (or who he is supposed to be) on this album. Before I listened to this album, I expected to hear gritty, descriptive rhymes about Yayo's criminal life. Unfortunately however, I, like many of you, tuned into tracks such as ""Tattle Teller,"" ""Curious,"" and ""Project Princess."" For an ex-convict, that is not the type of message you want to project to an audience that is expecting something more... hardcore; something better. On tracks such as ""Live By The Gun"" and ""Homicide,"" Yayo delivers my aforementioned desire for ""harder"" lyrics, but tracks such as these are few and far between. Hopefully Tony Yayo can focus on doing this for his next album but for now, this debut album is simply a dissapointment."
1,Terrible,"I bought this album, not because im a G-unit fan or nothing, but i just wanted to see what it was all about. This guy can't rap. He is as bad a 50 Cent, and that means really bad. There isn't a single song on that album that i can listen to more than once, infact some are so crap that i have to turn it off in the middle. I have never heard anything so bad. Up to know i belive that Tony Yayo should have kept his thoughts to himself."
1,YAYO IS THE WEAKEST LINK....GOODBYE,"He is not worth a whole cd yet. Maybe a verse, a hook or a ""Here we go now!!!"" But please not a whole cd. It was torture."
1,Negative 5 stars.,"Well this isn't one of the brighter spots in G-Unit. The amount of pub they were giving this dude, and the time we all have waited for this guy to get out of jail and this is what they released to the public. C'mon G-Unit records has to be joking. As you can see Amazon hasn't even bothered to put up the tracks for your listening pleasure. Please go cop a real album like Late Registration by Kanye West."
1,Tony Yayo needs to stay in Jail,Wow this album was a total abomination i was some what disgraced that i was a human being and out came this crap what was he thinking was he even thinking i dont know G-unit needs to start over and this is all i have to say
3,yeah right...,he gets a 3 because the beats are on point...thats about it...his lyrics suck but like a leech.
3,too much hype,"i'm going to be honest i love g-unit and everyone that f***** with them. i strickly buy g-unit and shady records F*** Fat Joe and Ja Rule. this cd wasn't that good with some pretty lame lyrics. he should have got more better producers on his cd. but the reason i gave this 3 stars was for ""drama setter"" the best track on the cd and ""so seductive"". also 50 spits a hot verse on we don't give a f***. i probably wouldn't have bought this cd if i wasn't a g-unit fan. those songs right there are worthy of the 3 stars. GGGGGGG-UNIT!!!!"
1,TONY MAYO - isnt even worth the download,Yayos album - the only song thats hot is WE DONT GIVE A KNUCK and OLIVIA belive it or not makes the song- 50 has been tryin to REIVE the MAGIC of his first album since it sold 11 mill with all of his GUNIT TOY SOILDERS - TRUTH IS 50 IS THE ORIGINAL WANGSTA and for the GUNIT GAME was the reallest out of the click- Lloyd banks is a kiss rider who never broke a law in his life and yayos kool but again NO KILLER - too much Gangster Killer Gorrilla talk but the truth is G you not - g units a bunch of clowns - go cop the new JIM JONES album if you wanna hear REAL gangsta music
2,Pure Garbage,Now I like my music gangsta as much as the next dude but really though this guy is trash. I could think of alot of better rappers than yayo including everybody on g-unit. I mean if you really wanna hear some gangsta s#$& then wait for styles p or sheek louches album to come out. Yayo's lyrics is weak and his flow is garbage. He can't rhyme to save his life. 50 should've kept some of these beats for himself. He only gets 2 stars cause of the guest appearances and the beats he has on the album. I mean wat was that s%^& that he was doing with his hands in the so seductive video. He needs to stay a hype man that fake ass flava flav. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this crap.
3,Dissapointed,This album is a lot like Fat Joes new album. I am not really a big fan of it. Has a couple of joints that are Ok but most are bad this album is only recommended to G-Unit Die Hards.
1,"They should have kept "" The Game""","this albun is the worst out of the G-unit clique. the title is attractive but the is garbage full shxxt. Since i bought this cd i have only listened to it twice. first, too many commericals songs danm what happened to the hiphop that we once loved? TONY YAYO needs to be in background lick 50's ass and be the hype man, as far as an MC, lyricist or an average rapper is not even close to Mike Jones. I hope the MObb Deep stay true to there style no follow this hafl ass niggas with the General 50 cent."
4,Dissapointed with Yayo,DAMN!!!!!!...they threw out The Game...so there is no feature from him...50 garbage...Buck's voice is annonying...Olivia's actually good...and THANK GOD for Lloyd Bank$...But this album aint ALL THAT BAD...some tracks are okay...but im still quite dissapointed with Yayo...he's still the best in G-UNIT...so...imagine wat the rest is like...
1,WHACK!!!!!!!! F*ck a star yall dont get Sh*t 0 outta 5,"Hey yo G-Unit is whack and yayo is no exception. The only one i can feel is banks and he aint sh*t either im tired of all this bubblegum sh*t people putting out these days dont pick up this albulm unless you just accept what they give you i miss the real sh*t. Pac, Big, Pun, Big L and all the real emcees 50 is a goddamn hyprocrite he talks bout ja for singing on tracks and does the same sh*t. F*ck them nig*as and f*ck yall too for conributing this phony sh*t!!"
1,Yayo is a NoNo!!,"Ok, if this were an all instrumental album, I would definitely give this thing 5 stars, maybe 6, but they just had to add his horrible, elementary vocals which is why I gave this 1 star. If I didn't have respect for Lloyd Banks, I would've given it no stars. Tony Yayo is one of the worst rappers ever!!! His flow is pathetic and his lyrics are pre-school at best. If you can get past his lyrics and listen to only the beats, then you are in for a great treat. Unfortunately, he's irritating, I don't you'll be able to ignore him and just listen to the beats."
2,Fif decided to stifle Yayo with the same formula,I was looking forward to hearing that Yayo energy that was heard on the GUnit mixtapes when they were hungry. Instead GUnit is just coasting on their connections with Em & Dre and 50's current popularity with the mainstream audience.
4,Fire,"Though It may not be lloyd banks ""Hunger For More"", Its still a hot cd. If you like any of the other g unit cds you will like this one. Its got some solid songs and some fillers but overall this is a good debut cd."
3,YAYO'S HOME!!!!,"I've been waiting for this album all summer! Honestly, I was a little disappointed. Yayo is great. He has a great flow and great lyrics, but the beats ain't there. That isn't his fault. The album is bumpin on ""So Seductive"" and ""We Don't Give a F___"" and ""I Know You Don't Love Me"". But I was expecting more beats like these tracks on the album. Some were saying Yayo is the weakest member of G-Unit. G-Unit doesn't have a weak member. If a member is weak, then he's out of the group. Look at The Game. He's out. Look who's in... 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, Young Buck, Spyder Loc, Mobb Deep, M.O.P. and Olivia (so hot!!!). If you like lyrics and G-Unit, cop this album! If you are just about the beats... still cop this album! G-UNIT IS ON TOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Not Bad,"The featuring artis semms like is always better then yayo but it still sounds good. I'd rather download this then buy it.1) Intro 6/102) Homicide 7/103) It Is What It Is 6.5/104) Tattle Teller 6/105) So Seductive Ft. 50 Cent 10/106) Eastside Westside 7.5/107) Drama Setter Ft.

2,3 good songs (and a lot of bad ones),"I like ""So Seductive"" ""I Know You Don't Love Me"" and ""Drama Setter"" The rest of the album is awful. I have been a G-unit fan since GRODT, but the music they've been putting out since the Massacre has been really lame. It's bad enough when 50 sings on his tracks, but now 50 has Yayo singing too? Yes, Yayo basically sings on several tracks on this album. And you'd have to hear it for yourself to really believe how bad it is. I'm actually kind of mad at 50 because now that he's producing all the g-unit albums and running the g-unit ""label"" the music has really been disappointing and a real diservice to any fan of g-unit. Slowly but surely people will get tired of paying for crappy music and g-unit albums will be completely ignored. 50 needs to give musical control back to Dre and Em. 50 cannot produce or run a label; he's doing an awful job."
2,"""Predicate Felon"" Review","The final of the original G-Unit to put out his solo album, the long-incarcerated Tony Yayo looks to follow suit in the success of his fellow G-Unit brothers, Young Buck and Lloyd Banks as well as the commander-in-chief, 50 Cent. What better way to do so than by following the same formula to a tee, right? This may perhaps be the biggest problem with ""Predicate Felon"". Aside from a few tracks written while behind bars, the content on Yayo's solo LP seems almost exactly identical to prior G-Unit releases. It's the usual format. You've got your party track (""So Seductive""), your songs for the ladies (""Curious"", ""Project Princess""), your song about smoking weed (""I'm So High""), and your pimp song (""Pimpin""). Mix in it with a few ""street tracks"" and some G-Unit collabo tracks and you've got the formula. While ""Predicate Felon"" has a few worthwhile tracks, Yayo, for the most part, doesn't seem like he can hold down a solo album on his own."
1,why?,"you'll be upset, not real hip hop. Basically its the same ol things g unit loves talking about and kanye West's album IS NOT garbage. In my personal opinion the man is a musical genious. Personally i did not buy Yayo's album due to lack of lyrical content, meaning, theres nothing really to the album. I heard it and probably had expectations of an album like pac (being he was locked up and came out and dropped a class) not the case for yayo. He is just trying to follow 50's formula of pop/hip hop songs with no meaning whatsoever. Dissapointing."
2,I Give Up,"What has happened to G-Unit? Please... Explain that to me. I honestly give up. 50 cent and friends have made a name in mainstream hip-hop, and now they think that they can sling out weak, half-assed, fake, girlie a$$ $hit? I like Banks, and Buck. Yayo's CD is okay...It certainly doesn't lack energy, but it's pop music. A little while ago, wasn't 50 and the Unit dissin' Ja Rule for coming out with ""LOVE SONGS?"" I could have sworn that Yayo just made a love CD! Jesus Christ! I actually used to like G-Unit, now I think they're a bunch of bitches. I still like Game because he's humble, real, and he can spit.GAY UNIT, TAKE SOME NOTES!"
1,Good music????? What????,"Who the hell called this good music? This is garbage. This trash ruins rap! It seems to me that I am the only one actually listening to the LYRICS of the song. Yeah, the actual words and rhymes! I know it may seem to be quite old fashioned nowadays, especially since MIke Jones went platinum.I wonder how many people who gave this album 5 stars ever listened to ""Illmatic"". Or ""Reasonable Doubt"". Now that is good rap. Trust me, just cop Illmatic, listen to it 3 times, and you'll throw this Yayo cd in the garbage bin.Damn, I don't get it, if you have good beats, why don't you put good rappers on'em. Damn, you'll sell three times as much.Anyways, go buy Kanye's album. It's not perfect, but he is the only one who is putting out quality rap music out right now."
1,Trash garbage wack,"Tony yayo's ""thoughts of a predicate felon"" is pure trash & should be recicle for cents.I cant even belive people nowdays listing to garbage like g unit , t.i., mims, bowwow,young jezzy,dipset with juelz santana rhyming about nonsense, lil john and have the nerve to call it hip hop or even rap cause its not that, at all.Why would anybody buy Tony yayo's cd ? Idk? I still wonder.Want real hip hop ? Listing to krs one, kool g rap, rakim, oc, lord finesse, planet asia, organized confussion, gangstarr etc...Leave this clubby bubble gum rap alone its pure wackness."
2,G-Unit at its worst,"of every band/group, there is always the weak link, Tony Yayo proves that he is the one with Thoughts Of A Predicate Felon. Many of the songs are not produced by Dr. Dre (one of the few things that G-Unit has going for them) resulting in ""greasy"" and bad beats. Tony Yayo cant seem to trun his mouth away from drug trafficing, being locked up in prison, hoes, ect. He lyrics aren't all that great either, making him have the worst voice in G-unit as well. He sounds almost as if he is my grandfather- maybe as a result of getting locked up. The few pluses on the album are ""Drama Setter"" feat. Eminem and Obie Trice followed by Eminem's constant adreniline rushing sound and beats (even though he only is apart of the chorus-a big mistake) as well as ""G-S**t"". My advice, download these two songs- this CD isn't worth $14.00!"
3,It's really not that bad,"This album is not as bad as some of these people are saying it is. Alright, so Yayo isn't on Jay-Z's or Nas' level - and never will be - but what do you expect from a G-Unit member? The beats are good, the lyrics...eh...silly on certain songs (such as ""Homocide"", ""Tattle Teller"" and ""Drama Setter"") but overall, ""Thoughts of a Predicate Felon"" is tolerable. It gets better after the first three tracks. At least it's better than Banks' album, and 50's ""The Massacre""."
4,Good,best songs on this album are:#2 homicide#5 so seductive (catchy hook)#7 drama setter#8 we don't give a f***#9 pimpn#14 G-S***#15 I know you don't love me (is ok)not bad cd but i'll be honest yayo can't is the weakest of all g-unit cds. honestly he didn't really had much to work with the beats were bad for the most part except 4 the songs mentioned above.ps 4 anyone who thinks tony yayo ain't no gangsta because he's song are mostly bout girls. well......let's put it this way whats the first thing a predicate felon wants to do after getting out of prison. lol
1,GARBAGE,"I had to give it 1 star but I wouldnt give it that. The people out there that think this is a good album are fanatics of GUNIT.Im a hip hop critc I listen to ALOT of stuff before they hit the streets. And that Yayo is GARBAGE. Not because of the production but its HIM.Granted the beats are HOT like fire, but his lyrics and delivery are TRASH. Out of his whole camp Yayo flow is the weakest. There arent too many cds I would go out there and buy so i gets it black market(bootleg) b4 it drops. Honestly im mad i paid $5 for dis. But for all yall rappers if yall looking for some fire to rap over dis is it, you just gotta tune out his damn voice. Gunit is hot but yayo is not sorry.."
1,Yayo Should Have Stayed In Jail,"Tony Yayo is the 2nd reason why I despise the G-Unit movement. 50 Cent may be terrible because of his sloppy rhymes, his humongous ego, and his decision to make a feud with The Game, but hearing about Tony Yayo makes him tied up as the worst G-Unot member.Yayo was sent to jail for gun charges, and incarcerated again for skipping out of parole. He should have stayed in jail. But no, he is set free and he cuts a song called ""So Seductive"", a song consisting of pop beats, weak flow, idiotic lyrics, and mindless yelling. Just take a listen to this one song and you'll get an idea on how terrible Yayo is.Also, the album flopped and was considered one of the worst of 2005. No explanation needed here. Unless you like hip-pop, stay away from this abortion."
1,omg tony yayo iz da gr8est,i luv tony yayo cuz he is so rill wit his lirics and 50 cent is his frend and dey are rilly good rappersyeah.......
1,Tony Yayo - Weakest Link on G-Unit !,"Tony Yayo's over-hyped debut has shown that he is the weakest link on G-Unit and a disgrace to the group. The only songs worth listening to are the ones where other people helped his weak flow:05 - So Seductive (Feat 50 Cent)06 - Eastside Westside07 - Drama Setter (Feat. Eminem And Obie Trice)08 - We Dont Give A F*** (Ft Lloyd Banks, Olivia, & 50 Cent)10 - Curious (Ft. Joe)15 - I Know You Dont Love Me (Ft. 50, Young Buck & Lloyd Banks)That's 6/17 tracks that are good! That shows that Dre needs to start helping out on G-Unit's albums more (Massacre could have been better as well) and quit worrying about Game. What the hell were they thinking sampling Britney Spears' Toxic song on track 12- Love My Style?? Not only is the song played out & girly but it also shows the lack of creativity used on most of the album."
3,Average G-Unit Cd,"To admit, this cd is not that good. Some of the songs are great but the others are really annoying. THe only good thing about this cd is the dvd. The dvd has some really cool stuff but the cd is wack.overall I give it 3 stars."
4,"Decent album, but not g-units best","I'm a HUGE g-unit fan and this CD has deff got some good beats and decent hooks but i wasn't overly impressed. Obviously its still pretty sick, there are deff some nasty songs on here, however i thought it was going to be crazy hot, like better than Banks & Bucks, but like i said, its still worth buying especially if your a g-unit fan! If i had to rate this among all the g-unit albums so far it might look something like this....1.)Get Rich or Die Tryin: 50 cent2.)Straight outta cashville: Young Buck3.)The Massacre: 50 cent4.)The Documentary: The game(not with g-unit anymore)Tied 5.)Hunger for More: Lloyd Banks & Thoughts of a Predicate Felon: Tony Yayo6.)Beg for Mercy: G-unit"
2,yayo yayo yayo.................,"mane where should i start? first of all he should be locked back up in prison for releasin a garbage a$$ cd like this...2nd of all he sampled brittney spears toxic on song 12 ""love my style""....3rd of all he has the most annoyin voice when he raps, dis n!gga screams throughout every track and waves his hand in front of his face for 20mins straight in every video....."
2,One good track on this album...because of eminem,"This C.D. is Perfect, Great, Unbelievable, Outstanding, and the Best.......When used for a Frisbee. :("
1,WTF,when i first bought this album i wuz very disappointed in what i wuz hearing. i cant believe i wasted my money on this trash. i aint no hater or nuthin like that. i give props but this album is downright garbage. i played it one time and nver put it my stereo again.
1,WORST CD OF 2005!! PERIOD!!,"I'm a g-unit fan. They coo. I like everybody who's in the rap business, except TONY YAYO. He should have stayed in jail. I wasn't feeling this cd except for his single, ""so sedductive,"" but the rest is so stupid! I do not know why I actually wasted my money on this. DON'T BUY THIS CD AND GO GET THE BEST OF 05', KANYE WEST, ""LATE REGISTRATION!!!!!"""
2,"Yayo, Yayo, Yayo","It's official! It's August 19th and I heard the Press Released version of the album. 12-18 months ago I would have expected more from Yayo, with the way G-Unit has obviously decided to go for quantity over quality these days, it's no surprise that this album is garbage. Candy SH*T. Man, the stupidest thing these cats ever did was kick out the ONLY member with some lyrical skill, now what? No real emcee or fan wants anything to do with them. Only kids buy this stuff. Please M.O.P. & Mobb Deep stick to your skills. Damn this better flop!"
2,More of A HYPE MAN than a RAPPER!!!,"50 is cocky, Banks is quiet, Buck is wild and Yayo is hype.If you dont believe me listen to the mixtapes.Yayo could've and should've done better.His mixtape 1-800 HOMICIDE was 5 times better than this.I think he is better off freestyling over other artist beats.There are about 3 cuts worth listening to, Drama Setter, We Dont give a (...) and I know you dont love me."
3,Thoughts of A Predicate Felon,Not what i was expecting i thought it was going to be way better but its still a cool album. I hope his sophmore album is better than this album. GGGG-unitTop SongsIt is What it isSo SeductiveDrama SetterWe Dont Give a F*ckG-S****
1,crap,"F**k yayo F**k Gunot mase is a hypocrite first he goes im a pastor and hes all about forgiveness and now hes doing this no. i dont think mase next album will sell that good. its gonna be scary if this album goes gold and if this goes platinum i dont know what can i do about that. i mean thats really disgraceful. o yeah and another thing F**k the dirty south!! them and their weak @ss corny club songs Lil Jon, Pitbull, Webbie, Gucci Mane, all need to leave the rap game."
2,Straight Garbage!!,"This has to be one of the worst albums I've ever heard. I'm not one of those G-Unit haters either, I like most of the stuff they come out with. This time around it's a different story. Yayo has delivered one of the wackest G-Unit albums ever. First off, he's not a great lyricist. Second, his flow is average at best. Third, the beats on the album are generic. Some of the beats on the album even sound the same! There are only maybe 4 good songs on the whole album (Homicide, So Seductive, Drama Setter, Pimpin'). Some people will go and buy this album just because it's G-Unit, but I wouldn't advise it. If 50 expects real hip-hop fans to buy into this garbage, I don't think G-Unit will be around much longer. I just pray that Mobb Deep and M.O.P.'s albums are not as bad as Yayo's."
2,Didnt pass.,"Yayo's album here was anticipated for months by the hip hop community, and now they are left with nothing but a disappointed and betrayed feeling. Yayo did not live up to the hype with this album. The prodction isnt all that great, and hes a little repetitive. So seductive is a decent track, and maybe 2 others, but this album is not worth the money. I feel sorry for all those who bought it. Sorry, yayo, try again."
1,Flawed facts and arguments,"I'll state from the outset that I don't buy into the Creationist movement, including Intelligent Design as set forth by Behe, Dembski and others. But if I did, I still wouldn't recommend this book. Not only are the arguments put forth in this book extremely weak, but Denton is in over his head when he adresses scientific subjects outside of his specialty of genetics. He demonstrates a poor understanding of chemistry, and his section on how the periodic table of the elements is fine tuned for human life is especially poor.For those who are interested in intelligent design creationism, Darwin's Black Box is a much better book - better argued, and Behe knows what he's talking about when he discusses biochemistry.If you don't believe me, take a look at the creation/evolution literature, and you'll see that Nature's Destiny is never cited, while works by Behe, Dembski and Johnson frequently are."
1,Life is a rarity.,"If the universe is made for us why is life so rare? If there is an architect, why did he make so few habital planets? It's a pretty big universe to make just to stick a silly two-legged species on this one planet. Why didn't life evolve on more planets? Because the chemistry of life does have some stringent requirements that most planets do not meet. Rarely does a planet have the right makeup and of those that do most probably do NOT have life? Does this really sound like a grand design? The designer could not have been too wild about his creation. He (being all-powerful) could have replicated the creation many more times and he didn't. ANd what if there IS other life out there? Does that make us less special? Obviously I am trying to point out how ridiculous (and vain) this whole argument is. Get real."
5,Powerful and Persuasive,"Michael Denton's book will not satisfy the ""creation scientist"" who believes in a 6,000 year old earth. His book will displease the neo-Darwinian atheist. Unfortunately for both of them, he speaks truthfully and is on solid scientific ground. His is one voice of a new teleological turn in science, a turn which has already risen above our horizon line.Thanks Mr. Denton for the book."
3,Destiny's Nature Appears Paranatural,"The evidence mounts daily from all fronts: Scientific Faith, Religious Faith, Scientific Fact, Religious Fact, historical discovery, biogenetic research, astrophysics. The conclusion that keeps arising from these diverse areas of inquiry is that the universe we inhabit seems to have been prepared, designed, arranged for our habitation by something or Someone. DNA can now stand for Design: Nature's Architecture. Architecture demands Architect. The Hebrew God has a pretty convincing claim to the title that has yet to be refuted archaeologically, historically, scientificly. There are no other serious contenders to the role of Super-Genius Engineer based on the growing evidence of irreducible complexity, meticulous micro-organization of not just information, but living information. This book read along with research of Answers in Genesis website (AIG) and Lee Strobel's Case For Faith will expand the reader's horizons to new avenues of satisfying truth."
5,Put the wonder back into your life!,"I found it easy to avoid participating in the struggle to be Right while reading this book. Of course those charts with sharp points and no scales are silly, as are all the ""what-if-water-were-a-thousand-times-as-viscous"" propositions meant to increase our awe at the coincidences. Unless you already know everything science has discovered that we can't know or understand, you will have your breath taken away by the astounding complexity and apparent intelligence of the cosmos and especially the human body. I was looking for a book that would show me the limits of human knowledge about life; that would inform my natural awe at growth and differentiation; that would encourage me to believe there's an unknowable force at work in the direction of order. This book does those things. Who cares who's Right? Go look out through those amazing eyes at the amazing diverstity of life."
3,"Even as a self-proclaimed ""Christmas buff""","some of these questions were beyond difficult, sometimes even downright ridiculous. I appreciated the separation into different levels, but even the subsections of the book seemed to have no real rhyme or reason to them (i.e.- a specific movie, certain Christmas novels). I learned a couple of things from this book, but honestly, I ended up putting it down quite a few times because of the headache I contracted trying to read it."
5,Quizman: Christmas Trivia,The book has many trivia questions for every age group. I am going to use this material for our Christmas party this year.
2,"Poor assembly instructions, questionable quality control","I've used professional models of these ab trainers, and this item appeared to be comparable in the photos. Upon opening the package & inspecting the parts, the metal tubing used seems to be adequate,and the hardware looks to be typical ""Made in China"" junk. The armpads & headrest are vinyl-covered pieces of foam over wood backing, poorly stapled & finished. The assembly instruction book is horrendous. Vague and tiny hand-drawn diagrams with confusing, poorly written instructions. I was shorted one screw, and supplied with four plastic spacers that do not appear in the assembly diagram, and are not mentioned ANYWHERE in the instructions. A big disappointment."
3,"Good, but not the best","Works, but not that comfortable.Assembly instructions not that clear.I guess not a bad deal for the price."
1,Not so high quality,"I am surprised this is rated so highly. It has sharp edges, it looks spray painted (not galvanized), and it's slightly mis-shapen. It simply doesn't look as nice as what I expected for the price."
5,Oval tub,"We ordered an oval wash tub for work to display stuffed animals in it, afterward it held artifical flowers and is just beautiful."
5,Look great,"Don't underestimate the picture..I thought these wipers were gunna be a maroon red cuz of the picture but there not, they're blood red but they look great. I put them on my old 89 f150 and they match my seat cover I just bought off amazon too and soon I will be buying a steering wheel cover..thanks amazon!!!"
5,Great memories!,"I remember reading this book when I was a kid (I got it from a book club) and laughing out loud hysterically. I still remember it as one of the best books I read as a child, and something made me think of it and look it up more than 30 years later. I think I may buy it again for another go-round!"
5,Salinger for kids,"I loved this book when I was twelve (the same age as Andrew). It is chock full of verisimilitude and I loved the style, which is conversational without being hackneyed.When in my twenties, I read Salinger's ""Catcher in the Rye."" A few pages into it, I said ""HEY!"" Holden Caulfield's voice is almost exactly the same as Andrew Kellogg's. Barbara Brooks Wallace cannot convince me she was not inspired by Salinger."
5,This is an extraordinary disk.,"The performances and interpretations of these extraordinary guitar concertos are fantastic. Richard Harvey's Antico is vibrant and romantic, and Steve Gray's Concerto is unique and lush. John Williams is wonderful, as usual. I could not stop playing this disk after it arrived!"
5,A musical gem!,John Williams shines yet again with this triumphant recording. Composer Richard Harvey has an innate ability to draw from pre-classical (mediaeval) music forms and write with an enticing emotionality that is completely at home in the 21st century. Prog rock music fans will know him from the 70's British group Gryphon. Steve Gray's compositions are a perfect compliment to this project. A wonderful CD. Highly recommended.
4,steve gray: guitar concerto:richard harvey: concerto antico,This was a present for christmas.the owner says she really loves listen to it in the bath after work with a nice glass of wine.
3,Meh,Overly sappy and sweet... and why did it take the koala doing a whole big THING to make her mom say she loved her?
4,Vidio or Musical,"I first saw the Broadway Musical. I ran out and ordered the original movie. It doesn't have the the big musical production numbers of the broadway play, but the singing is still worthwhile."
5,Kinky Boots,My 30 year old granddaughter told me about it and we both enjoyed watching it together. It was a fun movie. My Husband and I plan to watch it together some time this month.
4,Kinky Boots,"Kinky Boots:I really enjoyed this film, ,seen it before and wanted to repeat it,, the dialog is at times difficult to get everything they say,, due to the accent,, that's why it didn't get the last star,,"
5,Great movie - had to add it to my collection,"I saw Kinky Boots on satellite a few months back and knew I needed to add it to my collection. Some folks will see the packaging and read the description and come to the conclusion that it's about drag queens... but it's not. It's a brilliant, funny, heartwarming film about compassion, empathy, respect, understanding, and ""changing your mind about someone."" There's nothing in here that'll offend the kids - but it could awaken someone who may be living with their mind closed.The soundtrack is great as well!"
4,The Little Shoe Store of Kink,"Greetings all,The Little Shoe Store of Kink...one who could not survive as a small manufacturer of mens footwear...had looked for other ways to stay in business.So, with a ""Drag Queen"" for a style adviser, found that manufacturing ""Kinky Boots"" would be their niche.Its an interesting tale, quite well done, lovely story line, and an unusual twist on personalities and romance, and peoples hidden interests! Well advised to purchase this...especially if you have an interest in ""Fetish""!""Bizarre Suzanne"""
4,KINKY BOOTS ARE MY KIND OF SHOES,"Two heels way up! Who cares if it was a preposterpous movie, as one reviewer put it. It was fun, sexy and a feel good movie. Put your mind in neutral and enjoy the ride. Yes, predictable, but it was a fun journey seeing where it was going."
4,nice interesting comedy,"The story itself is a rather interesting. A guy inherts his father shoe business. It needs a change in direction to keep going. So he tries to save it by designing a range of shoes for transvestites. In the process, he hires a transvestite as a designer who becomes his friend and saviour. He becomes a *man* by taking charge of his fathers factory. He then loses his fiance by taking risks with his business and gains a new girlfriend.The acting is quite good. The story is quite refreshingly new and there are a few laughs."
5,Revisioning evangelism through the eyes of the Celtic Church,"Finally, a book that takes the interest in ""celtic Christianity"" that seems to be such the rave now and applies it to the modern church in a life-changing way. This book re-visions evangelism in a way that will reach out to people who haven't grown up in a church setting. Through his study of celtic Christianity, George Hunter saw an evangelism that does not expect people to live by the ""rules"" of Christianity before they are even accepted into the doors of a church. Looking at a group of Christians who reached out to the world around them and asked them to be ""christian"" and not ""civilized"" is true inspiration for us today when our churches seem to want people to know how to act before we are willing to even let them in the doors. This book is well worth the read for anyone interested in bringing Christ to their world."
5,The Real St. Patrick,"This was mandatory reading for seminary. I loved the history and backround regarding early ""evangelism"". These techniques by the early church have application in our day as well. Spending the time to get to know and understand the people groups that we are evangelizing in paramount. I still refer to the readings in the text during my Sunday School class and sermons."
4,Interesting Book,"I'm of Irish descent, and when this book was recommended by a professor at Southern Evangelical Seminary, I thought I would try it. I found it interesting."
3,Good evangelism- lousy Celiticism,"This book is an excellent treatise on evangelism, from an authority on the subject. Those who seek to win souls on a large scale can gain much insight from this book.However, the Celtic history is of the 'fluffy bunnies' sort. For the most part the book is accurate, if superficial, but there are two glaring inaccuracies. Firstly, this book assumes that there was a ""Celtic Church"" in the same way that there is now a ""Coptic Church"" and a ""Russian Orthodox Church"". This is not the case- there were Celtic churches within the Western Church, which was not yet centralized at Rome. Furthermore, the author's Protestant bias causes him to misinterpret St. Patrick's view of the Apostolic Succession."
4,Quick Shipment,I have not yet read the book so I'm not writing a review on it yet. Heard lots of good mixed with bad things about this book. I hear that the historical facts aren't 100% correct but the evangelical methods are great. I don't know. We shall see when I read it. Quicker shipping than expected.
1,Myst doesn't work on Windows 7,I played Myst when it first came out. It was a great game. I wanted to give it to a friend. After it arrived it would not install. No help on line. Most posts from help lines say that Myst will NOT run on windows 7. what good is it?
3,Softcovers available?,Would like to obtain additional soft cover issues Unit E & F - does Amazon carry these?
4,Extremely Practical Advise for All,"This is a fine book that frankly should be mandatory reading for all. The title gives the impression that the book is aimed at priests. It's actually a series of lectures/essays on the virtues give to seminarians. The advice given is rock solid, practical, and inspiring. It is applicable to all: young, old, men, women, atheists, priests. While firmly rooted in Catholicism, the practicality of the Golden Rule doesn't discriminate based on creed.One of the reviewers took the book to task for lacking scriptural quotes. I don't think he read the book carefully. Each chapter includes a scriptural notation in the header, and the text itself is peppered throughout with scriptural notations. The serious reader will have his Bible at hand to follow up on the cites."
4,"Dated, but very useful","I have the 1974 printing, which is an unabridged reprinting of the 1934 second edition. Since the number of pages is the same as the current edition, I assume there are no changes.The analysis is of traditional, rather than simplified characters, and the romanization system used is not Pinyin, but the older Wade-Giles. This makes the book of somewhat limited use to those trying to understand Chinese characters as they are written in the PRC, but it is still a very interesting work. It meets a need similar to that of Michael Rowley's Kanji Pict-O-Graphix, but for Chinese, rather than Japanese. (Rowley's book, however, is more accessable.)"
2,The Impossible Game,"This game is impossible! There is no way to capture characters in two rooms, so you cannot progress to the next level. The manufacturer has no service established to help with these problems: they said ....""get on-line and research it or go buy a book written about the game. The game was designed that way....I really can't help you!""."
3,Gold watch,"The watch arrived promptly and was in good condition. There are aspects that are difficult to tell online, that I ended up not being happy with. The clasp is hard to do and undo, and the crystals that show on the front don't go all the way around (I thought they did). But, it's still pretty."
5,American Sphinx No More,"Undoubtly a first class piece of work, in spite of the author's own character flaws. But, having taken the recommendation of another review (""Sphinx?, November 4, 2001), I ordered the book, ""West Point"" by Norman Thomas Remick, and found it brought Jefferson's character into clear focus. Whereas, you can't beat Joseph J. Ellis' books for scholarship, I would say that anyone who is interested enough to be reading this review should read the Remick book after finishing ""American Sphinx""."
3,"Good, But Not The Easiest Read","After reading this book, I must say it is informative, and the author's conversions of his learned interpretations into historical facts are interesting. But, it is not the easiest read. It is very academic, lecture-like, and hard to get into. I also read the book I found here on Amazon.com called ""West Point:...Thomas Jefferson"" by Norman Thomas Remick, which was much easier and more interesting to read. Because all the research the author used for the book is either material that Jefferson himself read or Jefferson himself wrote, I must say I came away with a much better understanding of Jefferson than I did with the Professor Ellis book. But, as a college student, it was an honor to read the Professor Ellis book. I still recommend it to you, as well as, the Remick book."
3,Detailed but a bit long winded.,"""American Sphinx"" is a very well written and detailed book about the life and times of Thomas Jefferson. I have read many of Ellis's books, but with this one, he goes a bit over board explaining some parts and at sometimes seems long winded. Very detailed and great for a person just learning about Jefferson."
3,Not in depth enough but an interesting read,"As with other books by Ellis I have read, this book does not seem to go in depth enough into each topic presented. Ellis offers interesting ideas, opinions, and theories but does not vet these out to provide proper analysis of Jefferson and all issues at hand. The book's main theme that Jefferson ideas/beliefs were never inline with reality was interesting but Ellis seemed to only broach topics that this idea fit within.I did actually enjoy the book and his writing style but this should not be the only book about Jefferson one reads."
3,It was alright,This was an alright book. I was looking forward to reading an in depth look at the life of Jefferson which this book did not fulfill. It was a very generalized story.Maybe worth a rental if you have read everything else.
4,Not as boring as you might as expect,"This book, about Thomas Jefferson, was really interesting and clearly written for a layperson, although it didn't condescend, either. Although he's one of the more popular American presidents, most people only know two facts about Jefferson: that he wrote the Declaration of Independence and that he had an affair with one of his slaves, Sally Hemings, so Ellis decided to write a book discussing some of the major events in Jefferson's life, what we can learn about his character from those events, and what his legacy is.The book was interesting and even managed to be pretty humorous in parts, which is sometimes difficult for history books."
4,Great introduction to Jefferson,"As someone with a limited knowledge of Jefferson, I found this to be a well rounded account of his life. At about 375 pages, it was very manageable and well written. I only wish the author had included photos as he did in his Washington book. In the end, I found myself neither loving or hating Jefferson, but mostly disappointed in him and the contradictions of his character."
3,"Interesting, critical look at Jefferson","I liked reading this book. More than other Jefferson books (even Dumas Malone's 6 volumes), you get a feeling for Jefferson's personality. That is reason enough to buy this book. I think, though, that Ellis loses his grip on Jefferson's personality about halfway through the book. After that point, Ellis cannot see anything redeeming about Jefferson. Books like this need to be written. Jefferson is too important not to be argued over. But ultimately, a writer must love his subject to portray the person most accurately. I suggest this book but also Dumas Malone's ""Jefferson The Virginian,"" the best volume on Jefferson I've read. BTW, Ellis seems to have turned his dislike of Jefferson (which is under the surface in this whole book) to outright antagonism. In a recent Newsweek article, he referred to Jefferson as ""a thinking man's racist."" Ouch."
1,Revisionist history,"I have read several books on Thomas Jefferson. The author takes significant liberty in coming to conclusions concerning why certain events happened as they did. Many conclusions are his thoughts, no fact. I felt early on in the book that the author was out to take Jefferson down a couple of notches in historical significance."
2,"Informative, but needs a more astute author","How does an ordinary person explain an extraordinary person? I am afraid the two stars are for research and interesting trivia, but not for Ellis' interpretation of the mind of a great man. The complexity of Jefferson's mind seemed to daunt the author at every turn and even a bad interpretation of Jefferson's motivations would have been preferable to Ellis' continually clearing his throat at the crucial moment and moving on to something less (to him) awkward."
3,Missing some parts,"Well written in prose style that allows reader to easily follow the complicated life of one of the founding fathers. Tends to skip negative events, especially second term with little or no explanation. Provides prologue which discusses events not sufficiently covered in main body, specifically Sally Hemmings. Epilogue takes the Jefferson legacy and applies it to events following his death up to current issues such as the fall of communism. Although it is incomplete, the subject matter provides a well rounded insight to the author of the Declaration of Independence and our third President. Well worth the read."
1,The Character - What a Character! - of Joe Ellis,"I'll bet that 90% of earlier reviewers who gave this book high marks would retract their ratings in light of the author's exposure as an habitual fabricator of ""history."" This book should be recategorized as ""historical fiction."" What a hack! Ellis deserves to be sued by the publisher, the purchasers of the book, and the American people for fraud. At least we have the satisfaction of knowing that this man's false witness has finally caught up with him. Due to the uncanny timing of Ellis' groundbreaking 1998 report, ""Jefferson Fathered Slave's Last Child"" -- just a few weeks before the House vote on Clinton's impeachment -- I recommend that all extant copies of Ellis' books be donated to the Clinton Lie-brary."
1,An american stinx,"I have read quite a few slow books but this really tops it off. It is a slow and boring book. Ellis portrays Jefferson, an American hero, as bland as Fiber One."
1,American Sphinx,I am a well educated person with a particular interest in Jefferson. I was amazed at the assertion by Ellis that Jefferson formed the republican party. The republican party was not established until 1854. The party the Jefferson formed evolved into the democratic party. Are we living in the soviet union now? if you don't like real history you just change it. How do I get my money back on his piece of crap book? I knew this guy has a history of stretching the truth but I didn't know it went this far!
5,A must read,This book should be required reading for all high school students. Most of the difficult decsions made by our founding fathers are clearly presented by the author especially the slavery issue.
5,I am a Jeffersonian,"This book is wonderful; although, I would not recommend it as a first book on Jefferson. Much detail is left to the author's of other Jefferson biographies. This book focuses on certain periods."
2,"Pretty good, but could have been a little less boring","This book was an interesting approach to the life of Thomas Jefferson by looking at his character rather than an entire life history with unnecessary details. I did not really enjoy the context though, because it was slow and at parts hard to understand."
3,Informative - But Biased.,"While I took away a number of valuable insights into Jefferson's character, I do have to wonder at how objective a person can be who is obviously hostile to many of the ideas of Jefferson and the founding fathers. Instead of showing his ""political cards"" in the Epilogue, I think it would more intellectually honest to reveal them in a Prologue so that the reader could filter their reading of the book thru his obviously left leaning lens.Aside from what I feel is an author that is somewhat disingenuous, the book is informative but needs to be read in the context of an author who shows bias."
3,good book,"This book is very helpful in understanding Jefferson anti-Federalist approach to political theory. However, look elsewhere for slavery's ""master-psychology"" impact on Jefferson's personality and how the 3/5 Compromise allowed slave numbers to make Jefferson president in 1800. I cannot understand how Ellis wouldn't discuss these topics in a book on Jefferson's life and character. Also, Ellis's information on the slave-Sally Hemings's six children via Jefferson has changed since 1998 DNA results rendered the positive connection. Ellis now accepts the fact that Jefferson had six children with his wife's slave, Sally Hemings, who was his wife's half-sister. Garry Wills's ""Negro President: Jefferson and the Slave Power"" should definitely be read before ""American Sphinx."""
2,"A Dry, Slow Presentation","I hate to take exception to the glowing reviews of this bookposted by others, but I would summarize it thus: "" Took offin water, cruised in molasses, and landed in tar"". The more I read,the more it dragged. I found that it left more questions unansweredthan answered, and provided an incomplete view of some of themore interesting aspects of Jefferson's social and political life.I was looking for a good all-round, comprehensive book on Jeffersonwhen I heard of and read this book. I still am"
5,A Wonderful Book on a Fascinating Founding Father,"Ellis is becoming my favorite biographer. This book is an excellent book on Jefferson because, as the title suggests, it neither lionizes nor condemns Jefferson but rather approaches him as a notoriously complex and very real human being. Ellis has a keen sense of what we want to know and answers the questions that we all have about Jefferson: What was going through his mind when he wrote the Declaration of Independence? What's the latest on the Sally Hemings controversy? What kind of country did Jefferson want America to be and how much of his vision was realized? What kind of personality did he have? How could a slave-holder say that all men are created equal? All these questions and more are answered in this relatively small book.John Adams was right. Thomas Jefferson not only survives but is alive and well and more mischivously paradoxical than ever!"
4,Great book!,"This book is quite pleasing, it is well argued and well written. If you like ""juicy"" biographies full of details and trivia you will be disappointed, nonetheless, it still has a wealth of biographical data that makes the book interesting and instructive. The main focus of the book is on Jefferson's achievements and legacy. The man (Jefferson) was an intellectual colossus and was never short on peculiar and original ideas; he remains an icon for all Americans that are wary of big government and all Americans that defend the sovereignty of the individual. I am glad I picked up this book as my starter on Jefferson."
2,Sphinx Stinks,"I did not enjoy this book. I was looking for a comprehensive review of Jefferson's life and theories. To his credit, the author makes an attempt at a balanced analysis of Jefferson's thoughts and influences. That is more than most other authors provide. The large and significant omissions of key events in Jefferson's life, however, are the biggest disappointment in this book."
1,Shoddy character assassination,"Prof. Ellis, who was finally caught last year in his long time lie of having served in Vietnam, presents as an indisputable fait accompli Jefferson's alleged fathering of a child with Sally Hemings. In fact, all that was revealed by the DNA evidence was that Hemings's youngest son, Eston, was likely fathered by one of the more than two dozen Jefferson males in the area at the time. Most likely is Jefferson's much younger brother Randolph, rather than Jefferson who was in his mid-60s when Eston was born. Recently a distinguished panel of over a dozen Jeffersonian scholars provided a detailed analysis on this issue and their conclusions ranged from strong skepticism to the belief that the charges were almost certainly false. Nevertheless, Ellis continues to propagate his jealous libel. His extreme personal bias taints this book and makes a reader wonder what other facts he has misreprensented."
3,Jefferson's Political Philosophy,"For anyone who wants to learn about Jefferson's political philosophy, this would be a good resource. But, very little was included about his personal life."
4,Elegant and Informative,"This is an elegant, informative and well researched book. I've learned many things about Thomas Jefferson (for example: he didn't like public attention) and Mr. Ellis' analysis is certainly worth of praise.The book is divided into five parts:- Philadelphia: 1775 -76- Paris: 1784-89- Monticello: 1794 - 97- Washington D.C.: 1801 - 04- Monticello: 1816 - 26As you can see, the book starts at the dawn of the American Revolution with Jefferson's arrival in Philadelphia as the delegate from Virginia to the Continental Congress and follows him to his later years in Monticello.While I highly recommend this book to any history fan, I'd just like to say that for me it was rather difficult to read. I don't know why as I love history and history books - maybe because the text seemed more like a lecture than a ""story""."
2,Biography Bogged Down from the Beginning,"After visiting Monticello and watching the Ken Burn's Special on Thomas Jefferson I was eager to read this biography but was sorely disappointed in this one, as it starts off slow and is an uphill read from there. Sorry but I have to give this one two thumbs down!"
2,If I wanted to read a textbook...,"Sadly disappointed in this book. It read like a textbook without a thread to string the sections together. There was a great deal of insight into TJ's life, but compared to a book like Fischer's Washington's Crossing that brings a founding father to life Ellis cannot compete."
2,Clash of Titans between Theory and Practice,"Unlike David McCullough in his superb ""John Adams"", Joseph J. Ellis has a hard to get into style that does turn Thomas Jefferson into a sphinx. The audience can have a difficult time to understand the similarities and differences existing between Jefferson and John Adams. Jefferson was a study in contradictions. He was often not practicing what he was preaching. For that reason, many people can reasonably claim to be the spiritual heirs of Jefferson."
4,Good background sound.,"I love trains. I even have a model railroad layout. Instead of listening to music, I like to just put this on, push ""repeat,"" and let this run as background sound while I do other things. It makes me feel good."
4,Diamond Drawer Organizer,"The Diamond Drawer Organizer did not live up to my hopes. It's fine as far as an drawer organizer goes... as long as the items are very small. I bought it in hopes of organizing my ""unmentionables"" and it didn't quite work out as planned. Each section is big enough for 1 pair of socks and nothing bigger. Bras? Forget it, no way would they fit. I had to move it to a junk drawer to be able to get use from it. It is a good, sturdy product - Just keep the size in mind when ordering it. :-)"
3,Not strong enough for a man...,"I have one of these for my sock drawer. It works fine for men's dress socks, hankerchiefs, and ties(rolled). My wife uses them for ladies undies, nylons, and scarves. However, it is too flimsy for my cotton boot and tennis shoe socks."
3,Did what I wanted,"I bought this divider for socks, but ended up using it for underwear instead. It does a nice job of keeping everything neat, and the price is great. The only complaint I have is that the outer edges do not look as good as the picture that accompanies the product. Nobody sees it but me, so I guess it doesn't matter!"
2,Better off stacking your socks,"Item arrived in a dented package (not from the mail, the cardboard had been scraped but not the outside of the mailed package). The instructions were pretty well useless, which would be fine if putting it together were as simple as it should be. The tabs and whatnot were sized incorrectly. I guess it does keep the socks from mixing with the underwear, but that's about it. I don't recommend this."
2,Sent them back,"I was initially excited but decided to return these. First, the drawers that I wanted to put them in do not open completely. These dividers will basically make the back of the drawer completely unaccessible. This is the case for all kinds of cabinet drawers that are on sliders. Maybe this won't be an issue for some furniture.These also are more complicated to set up than you would think. You have to break each of the dividers to fit and hope you don't make a mistake.Overall, not impressed."
3,A historical performance,"This is a performance that will be remembered because of its significance, not because of the stellar playing. The playing isn't that great, but they are playing their hearts out for Bernstein. There are quite a few mistakes and a lot of crowd noise, but I still recommend getting it because of the historical significance."
2,Historical but not memorable,"Although this CD has historical significance, and those in attendance will probably treasure the experience forever, let's face it, the performance of the Beethoven 7th is average at best. Bernstein is known for performing works at a leisurely tempo, but this drags and clunks along. Britten's 4 Sea Interludes are also performed at a leisurely pace, but the performance hangs together better, and emotionally, is more captivating."
1,sentimental yet awful,"This recording has historical and sentimental value, but it is one of the worst performances of the Beethoven 7th that I have ever heard. It just drags on to the point that I thought it was never going to end. Indeed, it was taken so slowly that the orchestra members themselves seemed to be struggling to stay awake. There is no emotion in this performance. It just keeps going and going and going......Get this CD for the sentimental value, but don't bother listening to it."
5,Leonard Bernstein: The Final Concert,"Even though this CD contained few orchestral mistakes and soft murmers of the audience during the performance, the program doesn't bother me much.What I care about this CD is that it was a sort of a ""good-bye"" concert of my very favorite conductor of all times, Leonard Bernstein.The performance was a little slower than other performances, but fairly neat.Britten's Sea Interludes from ""Peter Grimes"" gave me plenty of oceanic imagination and mood.I was nearly touched by the final movement of Beethoven's seventh symphony and the final bursts of applause and cries of the audiences.If I were to become a conductor, I would want to celebrate 50 years after Lenny's last performance by performing the same music Lenny had programmed in his last concert. I truly respect Bernstein as a musician."
4,A treat,"This is an excellent selection of shorts pieces, either written for cello and piano, or transcripted for the 2 instrumentws. The mood throughout is soft and relaxing: just right for meditation! The choice of pieces is appropriate, the performance is excellent. A good buy for cello lovers like me!"
2,Not much here,"After reading the reviews, I was excited to purchase this CD for my 1st grader. It has been a big disappointment. I expected a variety of games and activities, but it's pretty much just one thing (addition or subtraction drills) in one format (the equation appears on the screen and the child types in the answer). No variation, except the ""reward"" after completing a series of problems might be a rocket ship one time and fireworks the next. You can get similar drills for free on the math-u-see website. Just go there - no need to spend money on this!"
2,Delayed feedback,"I wanted to love this product, and it would have been perfect except for one big problem: there's no immediate feedback. My son can't tell whether he gets a problem right or wrong. All he gets is a brief flash of a total percentage correct at the end. I would rather have him do worksheets so that I can check them and help him fix the incorrect answers. It's too bad, because this is otherwise great - no distracting stories, characters or animations, just math problems on the computer."
2,TOO OLD,"10 years ago this video would have been helpful but if you want moves you will actually use, find another video. It is incredibly outdated. As far as I am concerned I wasted my money. If you can, check the production dated before you buy!!"
2,Great in concept only,"I have the On-Q products installed in my home, not by choice... these products are fair at best but while they're of good quality, they have limitations and the documentation is not well supported. I don't know what the competitive products are but this one needs more work. After 25+ years designing and building large corporate networks, I know what quality is and this is on the low-end of the spectrum."
2,Not bad,"I bought this because I am a Kiss fan, and there were 3 tracks co-written by Peter Criss. Not a bad Cd, but the production suffers."
4,Wide selection of Aircraft,My favorite plane in the entire game is the B-17. I recommed it for bombarding ships and hangars.
5,Excellent Children's book,"This is an excellent children's book that I sought out from my childhood. Unfortunately, the cover on the book has changed. However, these books make a great addition to any small child's gift."
5,The magic fish book,This is a childhood favorite of mine. I bought this for my daughter to share my memories with. She loves it just as much as I did.
2,Quite hard to read,I've never read a play before so found it quite hard to get into. But it turned out quite good. It has quite a good insight into aboriginal welfare at the time.
3,Book Review,"I think this book should get an average grade (""C""). I think this because, when I read the book, it didn't have me thinking what was going to happen next. I think this book is too obvious for me. But for the people who like to know what's going to happen, they would like this book. I think this book is more for kids who have their parents read to them. I give this book a ""C"". In the book, Dink, Josh, and Ruth Rose go on a trip to a castle. They are all exited, but then, Ruth Rose discovers a Dungeon filled with dead animals. Through out the story, the three smart children try to figure what it is from. The rest is for the reader to figure out."
3,Yeah the sound stinks....BUT,"These are demos; tons and tons of demos. Some available on other comps , some not.....Bolan must have had a tape recorder going every moment of his life , with all the stuff that is out there. Hey , look , if you can get over the sound , you will find a veritable treasure-trove of rarities here. No worse than the bootleg vinyls of LP days. Plus it gives you one more opportunity to hear a sorely-missed performer. Truck on (tyke) !"
5,The Best,"Von Karajan's Requiem is the best one ever recorded, plain & simple. It is of course in German."
3,Odd Combination,"Karajan is not my idea of the perfect accompanist. Instrumental, operatic, choral -- I can not think of a performance of his that I do not find, in some way, irritating.This reading is an odd combination of the elegant (the first two movements are rather nice) and the grotesque. The exxagerated crecendos are vintage Karajan. Overall, a little too quirky for my taste. I am reminded of the accounts of the 1867 Vienna preview of the first three movements. Apparently it was inadequately rehearsed and in the fugue ending the third movement, the tympanist felt inspired to play as loud has he could, drowning out everyone else. No mean accomplishment.An interesting document for the afficianado, otherwise choose Klemperer and/or Walter."
3,This one was lost in the Mail!,"First one got lost in the mail, but Amazon did replace it with a black version. The watch's neoclassic face is what attracted me. The EcoDrive battery is what kept me wearing it. I only had the second one for a year (I lost it!) but very few problems with the battery once it got charged. Citizen should keep this style or make a similar one. I haven't seen anything new that compares to this design, which is a shame(It's currently discontinued)."
5,They work great!,"I bought these for my '96 Saturn SC2. It runs a bit smoother and they have performed well. I won't say I notice any ""increased performance"" (as some may expect) but they are working well. Just be sure you don't couple these w/ platinum plugs in your Saturn. The dealer uses NGK plugs. I recommend NGK v-power."
5,Last of the breed,"An excellent cd. They may be old timers, but believe me, they cannot be improved upon. I thoroughly enjoy every song."
4,"Great recording, perplexing 2 disc format","I don't have much of anything to add to reviews about the performance. It's great. I like to cue it up in the disc changer with John Prine's In Spite of Ourselves. It's fun to get great performers' takes on old standards.That said, I'm befuddled by the fact that this is recorded on 2 discs. Each disc has about 36 minutes of music on it, for a total of around 72 minutes. That easily fits on a single disc. I don't get it. That and the absence of any real liner notes--the packaging is pretty weak--is enough to knock this down from five stars."
2,Going through the motions,"I had hoped for better (a lot better---if I weren't so disappointed, it probably would have been a 3). The material is OK, but it sounds like the performances were phoned in and these guys never actually sang *together* during the recording process."
4,Cowboys Reunion,"If you are looking for a great tribute CD for these artists, this fills the bill. Even though their voices all come through as weary from the road miles they have under their saddles, their emotions ring as clearly as a much younger version of themselves. They dusted off several old favorites that you will find impossible to avoid singing in the shower or car. This trip back through time is worth the cost of admission."
4,"Willie, Merle & Ray Together","It's wonderful to hear Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard and Ray Price sing some old favoritesTheir voices are past their prime, but it's still a pleasure to listen to this group."
3,Better in theory than in practice,"What's not to like about this album? Great singers, old familiar songs, it seems like just my cup of tea. But, for whatever reason, this music just didn't ""click"" with me. After just a couple of listens, I found myself skipping over these CDs in my CD player. I realize that this review might not be very helpful to others because I can't manage to put my finger on what it is I didn't like about these CD - I just didn't. If you don't already know and love the individual material of all three of the artists, I suggest you try and listen to it before you buy it."
3,Kind of Rough,"While they're still icons, the voices are not what they once were. Still a fairly enjoyable product."
1,view of last of the breed.....kenneth noell,"a very poor cd. you don't hear any of the most enjoyed songs of these singers. and none of the total great willie nelson songs.i sold my cd as soon as i could. you may think i don't care for these other singer.totally wrong. for i do. and have seen wllie nelson 3 or 4 times in person.and have or did have tapes & cd's of these singers,the likes of merle haggard & ray price.and loved each one.when i say country music i think of these men & other long done greats like waylan jenings. music, live on."
1,Disappointed,"I paid $24 for this book only to receive it and the price is stamped on the back ""$9.95 in USA""! I would look for this book elsewhere."
5,"Exhilerating, Exhuasting, Amazing","Get ready to be blown out of your socks. Improvisation liberates these classics, revealing perhaps how stuffy written music can be. Wonderfully engaging. Marcus shares his genius for interpretation."
4,Use it under ez-track,"I use this under EZ track to keep it quieter and it works well. It fits perfectly compeltley under the track, then I nail the track down."
3,Not what i expected,This is not what i expected but i guess for the price it is okay. My father was wanting something easy to feed his anenome with and i just dont see this being any easier than what he already has. Our problem is getting the food to fall off the stick into the anemone and I just dont see this helping with that problem.
5,Beautiful watch,Bought this watch for my son for his 21st birthday. It's a beautiful watch and he loves it. I have another different model Eco-Drive that i like very much as well. Highly recommended.
2,Date/Day Issue,"I received the watch and was very pleased with the look and style, and the band was very comfortable. However, the day and date setting of the watch was very strange. The day of the week altered between an English/Spanish dial, so it would begin with MON, then move to LUN (Lunes); then TUE, followed by MAR (Martes), etc. I'm assuming the English is between 12am-11:59am, and then it changes to the Spanish title from 12pm-11:59pm. Now on this particular watch, it would change the day of the week at 2am (English title) and then change again at 4am (Spanish title). It would stay all day like that, and then the numbered date of the month would always change at 11:55pm. Perhaps the gears are not calibrated properly, but I don't think it's a very reliable product, so I chose to return it."
4,all I expected,"this is my first non Swiss watch, for practical reasons. did not find this technology on any Swiss quality watch I was looking at. so far I am impressed with style and quality. it is really too early to objectively review, given that the watch is brand new. that's why I give it four stars.will have a better idea in one year.if I find a Swiss watch with the same technology at good value I go Swiss hands down."
4,Citizen Men's BM8240-03E Eco-Drive Black Leather Watch,"Watch is sleek, thin, and has basic functionality. It comfortable and reasonable priced that I can wear with my suits."
3,To little band!!!,"I like the watch very much. But the band isn't for a man's wrist, I think. It's so small, that I have to latch the band to close it on the first opening or hole in the band. Somewhat uncomfortable, and takes away from the nice look the watch would otherwise have!"
3,Mechanical issues yet looks good.,"I fought for the longest time attempting to set the day of the week. Turning the knob to set the day of the month (1-31) works like a charm but setting the day of the week (Mon-Fri) wasn't that easy. The day of week dial would act like it was changing yet spring back where it was. At one point of my fiddling it sounded like the gears were slipping (clicking sound). I eventually got the day set by doing the following:1. Set the time to something like (6 AM), not midnight like the instructions say.2. Change the day of week and day of month.3. Set the correct time.It's like there's something mechanically flawed where the gears don't work if the time is set to midnight (where the date is supposed to change automatically). If that makes sense.Also, the day of week doesn't change to the current day until 2:00 AM. Don't know why it's like that. I'm also not a big fan of the Spanish version of the days. Probably will not buy another day/date watch again."
5,christmas gift,My husband loved the watch wears it a lot great everyday watch I got him one with brown band too
4,"Good watch, band quality only OK","I love the watch itself. It goes with anything and is an all around great everyday timepiece. The fake leather on the band cracks pretty quickly though. It is still functional but it starts to look cheap after a while. The band is a standard size, however, so it is easy to pick up a good quality leather band and switch it out. Forget the band, get the watch. I have used it for 2 years and it still looks great and have not yet grown tired of it. It is a fantastic deal for the price from most perspectives."
4,A REALLY GOOD AND IMPRESSIVE WATCH,"GOOD QUALITY PRODUCT OF CITIZEN. LIGHTWEIGHT ,IMPRESSIVE LOOK AND REASONABLY PRICED MAKE IT GREAT. LEATHER STRAP IS VERY CONFORTABLE ANDIMPRESSIVE. A GOOD DEAL FOR SOBER LOOK."
4,A nice watch,Best of Pros: you never need a battery! This is just awesome.Worst of Cons: The strap isn't soft enough in my opinion.
3,It's too shiney,"I thought the picture of the product was misleading, in that the pic was of a matt finish; for both the watch band and the time piece. I might be able to speed up the aging process with some fish blood and primal dance. The Eco-Drive is still pretty cool."
5,Citizen Eco Drive Watch,"Wonderful watch, I bought it to replace a casual of mine that had seen it's last days. Very Presentable, keeps time very well! I was surprised by this fact, since the watch is so light and sits on the wrist with the weight of a fly. Very impressed."
2,It stops often.,I fully charged this watch in direct sunlight as they say you should the first time. Once fully charged it suppose to run for 6 months without any light. Well I store it where it is exposed to light and it stopped several times already. This watch is not worth the money. It is not reliable.
3,Seconds hand is not precise.,"The watch's face looks great, easy to read and I'd really like it as dress watch for office. But it has one major flow - the seconds hand is not precise and always points between the lines. I'm sure people around you will not notice that, but for me the only thing I see when I take a look at the watch is that every second slip :/ So I returned the watch back because of that."
5,Great for girls too,"I'm a girl and I bought this watch for myself because I like BIG watches. I wanted en Eco Drive because I'm sick of replacing watch batteries, and the last battery was over $20... But I looked at all the womens Eco Drive watches and they were just so small, or girly looking, or had too much bling. This is a nice classic looking watch. I was concerned that the band would have to much ""extra length"" but it doesn't, and I don't have a large wrist. So I think this works well for a woman, or a guy with a slimmer wrist. Love this watch."
5,Just a great watch,"Good looking, well built, no maintenance. For the record The leather band is beautifully made, and from Thailand. Apparently they dropped the controversial Chinese ones. Doesn't matter to me as I prefer expansion bands and put one on immediately. This watch face, by the way, is very easy to read at glance, even for the seniors among us (like me) whose vision ain't what it used to wuz. I fully expect this watch to outlast me (another 20-30 years, if I'm lucky,) and never need a battery change. Good deal!"
5,watch purchase,"I was looking for a quality watch without spending a lot of money. I found this very attractive Citizen Eco-Drive Men's black leather watch #BM8240-03EThe workmanship is excellent, the fact that you need no batteries is aplus and it keeps perfect time. I would recommend this watch to anyone."
1,A piece of engineering junk,I purchased it because of the highly touted Eco Drive. But it's impossible for me to set date and day. The mechanism is similar to most Japanese watches and it shouldn't be hard to adjust. But the crown is tiny and slippery. I couldn't do it. I have found that many people complained about this problem. I returned without further ado and ordered a Seiko instead.
2,Seconds hand off by few hairlines. Never able to set day,1. Seconds hand off by few hairlines2. Never able to set day of the week.Worst purchase ever!!Going to return it soon.
3,Difficult to tell time in half light,"It looks good, feels good and is fairly accurate. However, I am constantly mis reading the time as the second hand is more prominent than the minute hand, this is especially true indoors or in partial light. As a result of this, I'm now looking for a replacement."
5,a great watch for the price,"I just received this watch.It is better than I could have imagined.A very classy, easy to read watch. Setting it was a breeze.For the price paid it is an EXCELLENT value!Shipping time was awesome!"
5,Another great Citizen watch,This is another great citizen eco watch. I have had a couple previous eco watches before and this is another good quality watch.
2,Strap not what I was looking for,"Beautiful face on this watch. Built well. However, the strap was too cheesy looking. Very shiny and ugly. Returned it."
2,Hard to read,The arms of the watch are too small and hard to read. I won't buy another watch without seeing it first.
1,No Longer Brews,"After maybe about 20 uses over the past couple years, it no longer brews. Pump seems to be shot and beyond the warranty period, of course. It was pretty messy when it did work. Maybe 3.5 stars worth until it broke. Very nice looking, but obviously has some quality issues. Don't buy it."
1,Nice to look at but functionality poor,"Having redone our kitchen we decided to upgrade our coffee machine. Well,looks great, but function is pretty poor and does not froth well. I unfortunately have to agree with all the other negative comments left about this product, its a shame I did not read them prior to my purchase. Now to go and do the D.D. on other coffee makers BEFORE I purchase. Click past this particular coffee maker...."
4,Expressione,"Looks great on the counter, and makes good espresso. For the price, I don't think you can do any better. I wish it had a hot water dispenser, and a larger water container, but I love knowing the temperature of the water--something you don't usually get with lower end machines. You have to hold the top of the unit when you screw in the crotchless portafilter because it tends to twist. I am happy with the machine, and my friends think it is a $1,000 machine."
5,I LOVE IT!,"I absolutely LOVE this machine! After reading some of the negative reviews I was a little leary on buying this machine, but now I'm glad I did! I have found that you wont have any problems if you keep your machine clean as per the instructions. The Espressione Cafe Retro Espresso Machine is fast to heat up, all espresso machines are noisy, but this one is quieter than most and holds a decent amount of water. The steamer/frother wand could be a little longer but overall it works well and as long as you clean it properly will not let you down, it works very well and doesn't scald your milk.I highly reccommend this nice looking machine for everyday use, you will not be disappointed."
2,"after 18 months, i tossed this in the dumpster","Sure, it looks great. I bought this machine 18 months ago. What a pain! And an expensive one to boot! It was always a guess to determine the proper temperature, ground of bean, how much bean to put in the thing-a-ma-bob, how long to hover as it kept brewing brewing brewing or steaming steaming steaming. Dripped all over creation. Sputtered coffee grinds all over creation, sometimes in an explosive fashion that got all over everything with a resounding pop. Ran out of water with every latte. And, to add insult to injury, it started to rust out. Ugh. It is the very last thing you need in the morning as you are getting ready to face the day. So glad to toss it in the dumpster and replace it with something more reliable. Save your money and your counters!"
2,Not a winner,"First off, this machine LOOKS great. But unfortunately, that's where the attraction ends. You see, I too used a little Krups $45 espresso machine for years. But it was a heck of a lot easier to use, and made consistently better espresso/cappucinno than this dog. Here's a brief synopsis.The reservoir holds enough water for just a couple of days. I'm constantly refilling it. After making an espresso, the thing leaks out coffee drippings for minutes on end, making a mess of the whole machine. The steamer seems to spurt out as much water as it does steam. The lever that dispenses the steam does not move in a fluid fashion. And positioning the coffee holder pod thingy is downright cumbersome.Did I mention the thing leaks? Now you might forgive the little bugger if it made amazing capuccino............... it doesn't."
1,work good - for 1 year,"This machine was lovely, until the 1 year warranty expired. Coffee doesn't come out anymore. We followed instructions to repair it, but it suggested to return for repairs, which is in New Jersey. They can't tell us how much it will cost to repair until they have the machine in their shop and since is just shy over the 1 year warranty, we will have to pay for the shipping and the repair cost whatever that may be. So, we are wondering if it may be better to get some other brand new machine instead of repairing this one. This is not a good experience after paying over $300 for a machine like this. Your expectations should be that at least it will work for a little longer than that."
2,a weakling espressione,"After reading all the other rave reviews, I thought I had found the dream machine!...but...alas my old Krups, though slightly on the down side of it's brewing and steaming life, does a much...I mean, MUCH better job of giving me a strong tasty latte every morning. I may just order another Krups at a seventh of this price, and be glad I had it to return to. Soooo, my recommendation is to not buy this machine if you like a really rich espresso, and a really foamy, hot latte."
2,Another Blah Christmas Album,"I bought this one because I was looking for a very hip Christmas album. Knowing Peter White, what else is there but hip music. Wrong. This wasn't Peter White at all (except for 'Jingle Bells') - or not the Peter White I've become familiar with. It was just another 'dime-a-dozen' Christmas album... boring.If you want some smooth jazz hip music.. look elsewhere. If you want to sleep.. this is the baby for you. Just try not to snore too loud!"
4,II only to the Factory Manual,"I found this book pretty usefull for my 1988 Trooper 4 Cylinder. It is specific to troopers and pickups and hence covers the topics in much more detail than the Chilton's Manual which tries to fit in too many models into that book. My advice is to buy this one and if u still have cash to spare, buy the Chilton's as a second refernce. BTW, I got mine in Pep Boys for < $15."
4,The Isuzu Trooper,"I have recently purchased, in Saudi Arabia, an Isuzu Trooper built in the USA as a GMC Trailblazer. It is a LWB 2.6 fuel injected beauty. I have tried everything to get a repair manual in UK where I go on vacation, but with no success. I finally tried Amazon and Bingo, exactly what I wanted. Hope fully I will not be needing it too often, but after a few days studying, it seems to have everything I may need in a clear and concise manner. Typical Haynes in fact."
3,Does not include Diesel Engines!,"Lacks Diesel engine information. The rest is allright. I expected that *some* small parts, e.g. washers, bolts, bearings, would have exact sizes pointed, to make a substitution easier. Anyway, for ISUZU TROOPER this book seems to be the best, if you don't have ISUZU's factory service manual."
4,Trooper Repair Manual,Good book. I was able to use this book to fix up my 1990 Trooper. Details were accurate and procedures were good. Worththe money.
2,Haynes Manual for Isuzu,"The book is too simple to be considered a repair manual. It states in places that ""this manual cannot cover all years or models, so this is an average diagram...."" or similar wording. Statements like ""remove the....."" are no help without descriptions of HOW to remove the item. Other Haynes manuals I have used are much more helpful than this one."
1,wrong book sent,"After ordering a repair book for my vehicle, I received the wrong one. I notified them and they credited my account and added $3 for return postage on the wrong one. It cost me almost $5 to mail it back. They also said they would forward me the correct book. As yet, it hasn't arrived and I'm beginning to think it never will. Not too happy with the whole situation."
2,Boooring,"I mostly got it because Carmen Electra was in it & there were no reviews so I gave it a chance. It's a mocumentary on movie making. Personally, I don't like documentary style filming like Distract 13 so it had a huge strike against it right there. Maybe if you like Blair Witch & District 13, you'll like it but it just felt like a bunch of scattered, not that funny moments to me coarse I was playing a game while watching it. Sometimes I do that & the movie is so good I have to stop to watch more intently. Not the case here. At least the cast list was interesting. Still not sure it was even worth $2.00 though."
5,An incredibly funny medieval romp with an unlikely pair.,"This book has it all - historical accuracy, intricate plot with delightful plot twists, marvelous character development, coming of age angst, and humor in large doses. The 13 year old female heroine's tale of life with her adopted wild Scottish brother is the story of a lifetime - with an unexpected ending that will delight and astonish you! I have never laughed out loud so many times reading one book in my 58 years of avid reading. I cannot think of anything that would have improved it's readability."
3,"Good, Could be Better","Based on the back flap I thought this would be a light interesting bawdy read... it wasn't. The fact that there are sequels also irks me; why can't there just be one book? Although, the sequels are not as good as the first either. I love to read and I like to know the end of the story, so I did, but don't waste your time after this one, the ending just about the same (sorry!)."
1,Disappointing,"I read and enjoyed ELEANOR and like the mixture of fiction woven around facts. However, this book transcends fiction into fantasy. The tale is so unlikely that it becomes ridiculous and totally unbelievable.Not for me."
5,One of my favorite books,"Fun, adventurous, it makes you feel like you are living in the middle ages. Alix disguises herself as a boy (on the theory that she'd be unsafe as a girl) in order to go on a journey to petition the king, Richard the Lionhearted. Many adventures, friendships, and enemies emerge. How will her friends react if she reveals that she's a girl? Will she ever find the king? If she does, will he help her? Are the rumours of the king's fondness for young boys true? A totally engrossing and satisfying novel."
2,Quest Lacks Charisma,"This is a plot-driven book that covers a large swathe of time and space in 12th century Europe. The heroine tells the story of her journey from northern England to London and then to Jerusalem with the entourage of Richard I. The action is fast-paced, and the heroine is constantly reacting to a continuous barrage of events. Unfortunately, the author never gives her heroine the opportunity to ponder events, emotions, attitudes, anything. The story is all action-reaction, and although the history and setting are interesting, the novel disappoints because there is nothing soul-nourishing about it. There is no beautiful writing here to savor, and no truly charismatic character to cherish."
3,A Fun Read,"This is quite a different book about the Age of Chivalry and the Crusades. For one thing the heroine is a female (dressed as a BOY). I enjoyed the story it was fun and it kept my interest through the book. The story is bawdy and earthy, but so was life back then. Although the plot was a bit far-fetched, it was entertaining. It certainly puts a new light on a ""love triangle"", and I think really portrays what life was like on the all-male crusades where knights went to the Holy Land for years without the benefit of female company. This is an excellent book to add to your repretoire if you are a Middle Ages junkie like I am."
5,One of the best!!,"The greatest book I have read in a long time! Full of rich, interesting details, bawdy humour, and an actually accurate description of King Richard, Eleanor and John. I loved it!"
2,Not Chely's Best,"This is an anthology of Chely Wright's music, but it doesnt collect her best songs. In truth, Chely has released 2 good CDs (Let Me In; Single White Female); the rest of her CDs have been mediocre. The problem with the Definitive Collection is that it collects songs from the Mediocre CDs as well as the good CDs.Most of the songs on this CD bombed at radio; there is a good reason why. People wouldn't listen to songs like ""Sea of Cowboy Hats"" for free. Don't make the mistake of paying for them.Instead of this CD, I recommend purchasing ""Single White Female"" by Chely. It has fewer songs, but it has more high-quality songs. I would recommend quality over quantity."
3,The Best Songs Released by a Mediocre Singer,"Chely Wright never attained much success at country radio or at the cash register. She only had one top ten single on radio according to Billboard. And, she only has one gold album.This ""Definitive Collection"" CD shows why Chely never had much success. It collects her best singles (all but one song was a radio single); but of the 17 singles here, only about 4 are memorable. And that was Chely's problem. She would release one great song, and follow it up with two mediocre songs. As a result, she could never get any momentum going with her career.There are a few great moments here, but its mostly forgetable. There are far better CDs in the Definitive Collection series."
2,"Real ""program Nashville""","Purchased after seeing BIO on Showtime or HBO - Got this and her newer album released as part of coming out story - Lifted off the ground much more interesting - Amazing, wrong, and sick how Country totally shut the door on this talent. Buy ""Lifted off the Ground"" to get a deeper look into this conflicted song writer"
5,Dora TV,My daughter received this for Christmas. I received it in 5 days and it looked brand new. It is still working after 7 months of my daughter's torture. Thank you so much.
2,I am just glad it works and it makes my daughter smile!,"The Television works but it makes that wierd sound when it comes on. Like the T.V.'s did in the 80's. It sounds like it needs to boost up before it turns on and when it turns off. But I got it at a good price, it got there before Christmas and for that I am greatful. Thank you amazon.com!"
2,"Usuable, but difficult","While getting its point across, this book was filled with errors and proved to be incredibly confusing at times. Pain often makes theoretical jumps in logic that are difficult to trace for an undergraduate student, as he provides little in the way of an explanation. This text is useable, but approach with caution."
5,Feargal Who? FEARGAL SHARKEY,"When I first heard this album when it came out on vinyl, I had to have it. When I asked who the artist was and was told it was Feargal Sharkey, my reply was Feargal Who?? Never heard of him before. It was an Import from the UK and he was well known singer everywhere but here.His voice will hypnotize you, it's so beautiful,especially the song Someone to Somebody. The whole cd is excellent. If you want to listen to a guy with a beautiful voice thatwill make your emotions come to life, listen to FEARGAL SHARKEY. This one's a #6 on the scale of 1-5."
3,A rare find from the '80s,I had this tape in the '80s and got nostaligic for it and bought it from Amazon. It is nice if you like cheesy '80s tunes... and who doesn't?
3,Has its moments,"I've found that DJ Qualls is genuinely funny given the right script and this one certainly has its moments. The basic plot here is an old favourite as his stereotypical nerd character struggles to re-invent himself as a popular hero. Unfortunately, there aren't enough other funny characters in the movie to back him up and give him something to bounce off of. Likewise, Eddie Griffin seems a bit stale in his role as he struggles to get new life out of old jokes. Even without a strong supporting cast, the movie still manages to turn a few good laughs and is worth watching if you enjoy teen comedy movies."
1,worst movie I have ever seen.,"I would give this a negative star rating, if the options would have allowed me. Anyone who gave this a positive rating, is definately smoking something. I generally love a good comedy (something about mary, dumb and dumber, meet the parents, road trip, and the american pies), but this should not even be mentioned in the same breath as these movies. I was optimistic because the lead character (DJ Qualls) was in road trip, but he definately took two steps backwards with this movie. If I was to say one positive thing about this film, it would be that Eliza Dushku is very hot, and is a decent actor as well, but is not worth the rental price of the dvd."
1,"Prison culture is ""cool""?","If you are an intelligent young person, you will undoubtedly see that the makers of this movie are trying to shape your attitudes about what is ""cool"" and ""fashionable"". For your own good and the good of our American society, reject the many dangerous messages suggested by this movie.Watch this movie closely and think about the messages that are being suggested to you. According to the makers of this movie, what is the ""cool"" way to walk and talk? What is the ""cool"" music? Who are the ""cool"" guys for the young women to date?If you made this movie, would you suggest the same messages? Think about it."
1,"Hopefully, teen comedy gets no more tedious than this","Teen comedy has become much of a hit-and-miss proposition, but this really takes the miss factor to a new level, making me miss the likes of SHE'S ALL THAT. The gags here are rarely funny, just mostly tedious and/or cruel. For those of us who had any school social difficulties, it's just hard to watch, with virtually no reward for hanging in. Hopefully NOT the wave of the future!"
1,The New Guy is one of the worst movies ever.,"Don't buy this DVD, The New Guy is one of the worst movies I have seen. I think I laughed once in the entire movie. Do yourself a favor and throw your money into the street instead of buying this crap."
4,ending ruined it for me,This movie is for viewers who like something different. It's not your typical office comedy. It starts out funny and veers straight into weird and suspenseful but then hits a brick wall (or cubicle wall in this instance) and crashes into a heap of inane. Getting to the end was too sloppy for me to really recommend this film but I gave it 4 stars for almost making a truly original film.This film is about the true horrors of the first day at a new job for a typical guy trying to find his way in the corporate stucture that he now has to inhabit. The office has a bit of a cult-like atmosphere with the building ID being a highly coveted item. This film has moments of hilarity that make it worth viewing (the voice mail left for his date was great) once but once only.
4,"Goal setting in action, no really....","This is a funny (low-brow, guy stuff) movie but it illustrates modeling, goal setting, building self esteem and other NLP processes."
2,Totally gleesome.............NOT!!,"Oh yeah! I forgot to laugh when the guy does something with the eyes. Jeez!Give me a break. If this was an attempt to make a really funny Teen Comedy, heck it failed. The acting is okay, but the theme is really poor which eventually leads to the downside of the entire movie. I mean check this out. A high school kid, is a no-body in his prior school and suddenly becomes a somebody in his new one, by doing really stupid stuff, like poking kids in the eyes,and doing something weird with his own. I really Admire Tony Hawk but his intervention in this movie really has no meaning! Overall, a very corny movie with a very corny theme!!"
2,Mildy entertaining.,"From the the trailer previews I thought this was going to be a lot funnier than it was. I know its suppossed to be a corny comedy, but I had a hard time with this one. Vanilla Ice did a better job entertainig me in his 10 second cameo than the lead actor.Only a few funny parts, and lack of any real acting (with the exception of Eliza Dushku), and just general predictability made this one not worth seeing again."
2,Could've Been Great...,"""The New Guy"" wasn't as good as your typical teen comdies. It was overall boring, annoying and very unfunny. Even though it had tons of celebrity cameos, such as Gene Simmons of Kiss, Josh Todd of Buckcherry, Tony Hawk and Tommy Lee, the fim is still pretty much [lame]. The plot is good, it's just that they didn't fufill the funny part. Boring jokes, stupid commentary and bad acting, all leading up to an amazingly predictible ending. Not even worth a rent, but if you absolutely HAVE to see it, just rent it. DO NOT waste 20 dollars on the DVD. I wasted about 30 at the theatre."
3,Harmless Silly Teen Comedy,"I purchased this DVD mainly because I was curious to see more of Eliza Dushku. On that level, I was not disappointed. She does a lovely job in a role very few women can play: she manages to embody both the level-headed girl-next-door, and the adolescent sex fantasy babe required by the role. The scene of her trying on a multitude of bikinis was worth the price of the DVD by itself. Having said that, this is hardly a classic example of filmaking. The movie is often clichéd and clumsy, and while watchable, not as funny as it should have been. This is a Nerd Fantasy, with no real attempt to ground itself in anything that might resemble reality. What's more, there are no extras, and I hate that. A trailer and a music video simply do not suffice. Therefore, what we're left with is a nice little 2.5 star teen comedy, made watchable by the presence of Ms. Dushku."
4,Silly Fun,"As a fan of Eliza Dushku, I must say this has two of my favorite scenes of her. The movie is def. on the sophomoric side so give it a pass if you just can't enjoy those types of movies. I think it's fairly entertaining for that genre. If nothing else the soundtrack is pretty cool. The amount of interesting gues stars is fun to track & you'll get a recap in the end credits. A very fun movie for those who don't take movies too seriously IMO."
2,"Been there done that, got the T-SHirt","THis movie had such potential, and the first half hour ior so is actually quite entertaining. But beyond that this tale of Rags to Riches fails to impress beyonf that. The antics of Dizzy Harrison proves to be monotonouse. I mean the stereo typical bully who girl friend ditches him, the best friends who break apart and than get together in the end. The fact that he is revealed for what he is in the end and ends up with the girl anyways this is a been there done that re hash of so many things in the past. Further proof that an origional idea can go so wrong with so many things to steal from out there.If you want an origional comedy that truely satisfyes than go for Super Troopers, but beyond that don't waste your time with this."
5,great movie as long as you have a good sense of humor,"I thought this movie was hilarious. This movie isnt for everyone though, you need to have a good sense of humor. It helps if you are still young to, most adults won't go for it. Im 19, and i have a great sense of humor. If you liked movies such as Van Wilder, Not Another Teen Movie, American Pie, and movies like these, then you will get plenty of laughs out of The New Guy. The fact that there are alot of cameo apperances in the movie makes it cool to. Tony hawk makes an apperance and Vanilla Ice, just seeing him should make you laugh! Im a huge Buffy and Angel fan, so anyone else who is will like it because Eliza Dushku is one of the main characters, and shes good not bad. If you have a few friends over and want to have a good laugh then watch this movie."
4,"Good humour, great movie!","I love Dushku and Griffin in this movie, they RULE!! This movie absolutely rocks, even though some parts are kinda unnecesary, you'll find out which parts after you watch it! DJ Qualls plays the main character, who gets bugged and teased all the time, nothing new yet, then he gets expelled on purpose, meets the narator of the movie(Griffin) and that's in jail! He comes back with a tattoe and a new hair cut and meets the jerk's girlfriend(Eliza Dushku). She starts throwing her boyfriend aside and paying atention to the New Guy! It's a pretty cool movie, and you know with Griffin, it's always FUNNY!! Great movie!!"
2,"Rent since Eliza Dushku is in it. Rest is bad, really awful","Well, I was looking for a ""no brainer"" night, so I rented this movie with UNDERCOVER BROTHER. I have to say that overall THE NEW GUY is better, but both movies are quite pathetic, as far as comedies go. How low has our society sunk when movies have become this lame in quality? Anyway, I knew this was going to be a stinker, but I did end up liking the lead character somewhat and felt enchanted by Eliza Dushku. She is beautiful and plays a particularly likeable character. Most of the other characters, however, are not worth mentioning, and the script was weak and unoriginal (full of references to other current movies and events)."
2,Save Yourself,"I got this movie not expecting to much from it, just hoping for one or two moments that would make me laugh. Needless to say I did not get that, this movies could not even make me smile. If you are looking for a comady do not get this movie. This is more of a ""feel good"" movie than a comady. I have a collection of 80+ comady movies, some good most arn't, but I can honestly say that this is the worst one that I purched. I actually threw it away after I watched it. Save yourself some money and leave this on the where it is..."
1,TERRIBLE!,"New Guy is a movie with terrible storyline, and is very unfunny. It lacks any laugh out loud parts. Its strange storlyine kept me waiting for something funny to happen, but it never came. DJ Qualls was terrible in this movie and I'd not reccomend it to anyone!"
1,Boredom,This movie was just kind of [slow]. I'm an 18-year old male and I can't believe I'm the target audience for this type of film. I can't say I'm an Eddie Griffin fan (mainly because I don't think he's very funny) and I'm definitely not a fan of conformist movies and this fell right in there. The jokes are really predictable and aside from a few small cameos and side-roles(Vanilla Ice and Kurt Fuller mainly) I don't think I laughed once. Although I can't say I complained when Eliza Dushku was trying on swimsuits etc.
1,"Terrible, Bad, Painful movie","I'd say the 3-star average review for this movie is probably the average IQ of the people writing the reviews. This movie fails at every attempt to be funny. I did not laugh once. I am a fan of dumb movies. I loved Zoolander, Kung-Pow was one of my favorite movies, and American Pie wasn't terrible. This movie is terrible. Coincidentally, the only funny part of this stinking piece of [junk] is when the young Dizzy is dancing and falls on his crotch while doing the splits, exclaiming ""I hurt myself"" in a James Brown-esque tone. This is how I feel about the movie. Even though I fell asleep for most of it, this movie actually made me depressed it was so not funny and left an empty void of unfunnines in me for a day or two. Really. I don't know why Lyle Lovett and Henry Rollins agreed to be in this movie. I have lost most of my respect for both of them, even though Black Flag was a great band. ..."
2,cheap comedy,"you know after only 10 minutes that this atrociously unfunny high-school comedy there were two scenes that made me laugh as hard as anything in any movie this year.and the Part of the problem with The New Guy is that it's an R-rated film trapped in a PG-13 body. Like so many movies today, it is squeezed into a rating that will allow it to cater to teenagers, even though the material screams for more irreverence. the scene has to be staged so that you know what's happening without really seeing it, and that causes the whole joke to collapse under its own weight. By being so careful not to show too much, the editing totally distracts from what's happening. It feels awkward when it should be hilarious"
3,america's critic,this movie had sum pretty funny parts sum times it lost momento and dulled down sum but for a couple laughs check it out
3,"So much potential, so little impact","It's truly unfortunate when bad things happen to good actors.I'll be honest. The only reason I went to see this movie in the first place was because of Eliza Dushku. And the fact that she is in it is the only reason I gave it 3 stars (just couldn't bring myself to put anything lower). I know her talent is going to blow peoples minds once given a quality part, but for now she is stuck being the one good thing in a lot of bad movies.This movie was so predictable that I'm sure I could have recited the dialogue right along with the actors while the movie was playing. And the corn-factor was so high that I actually found myself groaning out loud. Yes, good moral...it's cool to be kind. But, did they have to hit us over the head with it? There is such a thing as subtlety.I want to be able to tell people to at least check this movie out, but I can't."
3,Give it a chance,"This movie really had me questioning myself about why I rented it when I first started watching it. But after it got going it really picked up. No, I'm not going to say it's a great movie and laugh your butt off kind. And yes, it's a teeny flick. But it's worth watching it at least once. The moral isn't all that good, if there was one. Why do you always have to have morals anyways? The cameos are good and funny. I had a few laughs at those. Especially Tony Hawk and Vanilla Ice. You may not love it but give it a chance."
2,"I like paranormal romance, but not this...","I am always looking for a good vampire romance novels. I was excited when I read the reviews for this one. So excited that I bought all three books (and paid almost [$$$]). What a total waste of money. All three books were poorly written. The character development is non-existent. The sex is not sexy or enticing. There is no build-up in the relationships, everybody simply loves each other for no apparent reason. The only thing going for this series is the author's imagination. Don't waste your money of these books!"
5,Jorge Amado,Jorge Amado is the best brazilian writer. Dona Flor and her Two Husbands is a very funny and interesting book that shows a little bit of the bahian culture.
3,IT WAS OK!,"Not much else to say -- although there is more to the story ---Jade Adams melted the minute she found the frightened, orphaned five-year-old. She wants the little tyke. She would even cooperate with the attractive doctor, Nathan Walker, in charge of the boy.Nathan gets to meet Talal and his wife, Linnea - brother to Zed and Jade Adams -- Now the King of Kholi is Talal's great-Uncle, of the royal family, the Zohairs. Does that make Jade a Princess??Needs to be reread to get all of the characters straight but worth reading.Read and form your own opinion -- is probably better than I thought."
4,Mother of a 4 year old PIG lover,My daughter got this toy as a birthday gift to go into her new dollhouse. She loves them! Very good for interactive play.
1,"Dont spend your money on overpriced junk..For 629dollars,there are at least 25+new machines,not refurbed junkware.","I am sorry.I had to respond to the listing of this crappy outdated,laptop.Many years ago i owned this troublesome model.It was slow,and had little capacity,for todays computer users.I gave it away...Now if it sold for 300 dollars,id say it was good for e-mail,and slow surfing,only,maybe!!!There are many brands offering at least a 60 or 80 gb hard drive and higher quality 15.4 inch screen...At this price point you can get a gatway,dell,acer,hp,and more,when on sale...I am very angry...I hate to see people get ripped off...You can get a good sony hd tv,enty level for this price...Please look elseware,for a computer...Thank you Stewart L."
1,Boat Anchor,"I should preface this by saying that I love IBM laptops -- I've had several (including the T42 I'm using to write this review) and agree they really are the gold standard for laptops. Although they may lack some of the whiz-bang features of HP and Dell machines, they are bullet proof, and have the best keyboards I've ever used.With that... I'd take a pass on this machine. Lenovo (who accquired IBM thinkpad operations) sells consumer machines that cost a few hundred dollars more than this, but are able to run current operating systems. With the soon to come release of the next version of Windows, this machine won't do. Moreover, it hard drive is small, and would require an upgrade for many applications, such as photos, mp3's, etc. Or, if I really wanted an IBM machine, I'd troll E-bay for more current used machines or factory refurbs."
1,"BUGS, BUGS, BUGS","I purchased the download version of this game and I when I play season mode, franchise mode, or playoff mode, after the game is over I cannot get to the screen to save the game. It is ridiculous!!!! I checked for a patch but the game is still doing the same thing. Do not buy this game!!!!! The game play was good, I enjoyed it but I cant enjoy it if I cannot save my progress."
1,WORST OF THE WORST,"EA lost it. NBA LIVE is the WORST NBA game now, no questions asked. Buy NBA 2K7. Much much better.Too many bugs. Too many bugs that I cant write it all down here.Worst of all, the game crashes everytime, EVERY SINGLE TIME I play.This has happened to numerous players, and even the bug fix EA came up with after a month did nothing to fix it.The laugh is that EA was so stupid they had to release a fix of the bug fix, as the first bug fix could even be installed by anyone.This game is not worth anything at all. Its a total JOKE.I can probably make a better game myself, at least a game that works!!Do me a favor, lets not buy any more EA products and push the retarted and disrepectfull company to bankruptcy."
1,DVD only?,"Too bad this only works if you have a DVD drive on your PC. I've played the NBA Live games every year for the past few years, but this year I can't even try it out, as my PC only has CD-ROM drives. Sure, that might not be an issue for a lot of the people who game regularly, but I have no use for DVDs on my PC -- sorry EA, would love to have given you my money, but you won't let me."
1,i didnt have the color chips,before you buy this game make sure have the color chips and all that stuff needed. it doesnt say what are the requirements on the page but you have to have something like an ati radeon chip and nvidia something like that
4,Works great!,"Only problem is that if you try and shoot with it open, you poke yourself in the face. But that's certainly user error."
3,I agree--sizing is way off.,"My son was wearing a size 9 or 9/12 shoe when he picked out these skates, and it was NOT easy to jam even such a small size in on the longest skate setting--especially with an impatient two-year-old wanting to get going. The pads, on the other hand, are plenty big. They slid around, though, if they were loose enough that our kiddo wasn't complaining about how tight and uncomfortable they were.Once rolling, the skates do pretty well--the wheel setup is pretty decent for starters, I think. The wheels don't stick too much or spin at a frightening speed.Good concept--just wish we could've used it longer."
2,A very disappointed 4 year old,"I bought these for my 4 year old, knowing he wouldn't be able to wear them long, but thought they would be a good beginner skate for him and then we'll get him new ones for his birthday in a few months. He wears an 11 1/2, and the shoe wouldn't even fit in his skate. We pulled out 11's, and they didn't fit with his feet in the shoes, though we could cram them in without his shoes on his feet. So, they will go back tomorrow and we'll just get him regular skates."
2,Buy proper skates instead of this toy.,This item is not a good product. The adjust ability is okay but you will have to shop for special flat shoes in order for the shoes to fit into the front end of the skates. My son wore them once.
2,Sizing is off,"The sizing is way off on these skates. The package says size 6 - 12 shoes, but my son's size 10 sneaker has to be jammed into the largest skate setting and it still doesn't rest on the bottom of the skate. We tried the same skates out a couple of months ago when he wore sandals, but a thicker shoe just isn't fitting. We like the fact that you get the pads and skates together, but we'll have to return the set since we want to use the skates longer. Unless your child has a small foot, I wouldn't recommend these skates."
4,great waffle iron,This iron works perfectly. Great waffles every time. Only thing I wish they'd done differently is provide a cool-touch exterior. The metal exterior it has gets very hot.
5,Excellent Product,"I'm totally happy with this product. Although it makes only one waffle at a time, it makes them very quickly; added to this, it heats quickly. This iron cooks the waffles evenly and the shade selector is excellent. Anyone who wants a waffle iron should seriously consider this one."
4,Waffles are Great!,"I enjoy the waffles from this VillaWare V2002 and the pockets are deep. It cooks quickly and the beep is loud enough to actually hear it. The only complaint I have is that there is ink printing near the controls and this ink is rubbing off after the first time I used this machine. As I was cleaning the wafflemaker with a soft cloth and plain water, the ink was smearing and rubbing off! That was weird to say the least. Otherwise the waffles cooked up very good."
5,A Wonder of a Waffler,"I sought out this product because I needed a new waffle maker and this was the one Alton Brown used on Good Eats. So far this seems to be a very wise decision on my part. It makes good sized waffles and does so very quickly. Once it gets heated up for the first one, subsequent waffles take about 3-5 minutes. All the features (browning levels, alarm when complete, etc.) are very handy. I'm quite pleased with my purchase."
5,Great waffle iron,Previous reviews of this waffle iron were right on. Makes great waffles and easy to clean. Works very well with Krusteaz Wheat & Honey mix modified for waffles. We like this the best. Waffles come out well each time. Generally have found that letting them cook until steam stops escaping has been better indicator of being done that alarm. Upright storage is nice too.
4,Fast and Sturdy Waffle Maker,"PROS:Cooks very fast!Sturdy and heavy construction (especially when compared to the brands available at Target and Walmart).Beeps when the waffle is done.Nonstick finish actually works and seems very durable.Small footprint and convenient cord wrapMakes perfectly cooked waffles.CON:The printed ""doneness"" settings wear off very easily when wiping off the waffle maker.OTHER:For the BEST waffles, you should useGolden Malted Pancake & Waffle Flour, Original, 33-Ounce Cans (Pack of 3)"
1,Unit never completely cooks waffle,"I also purchased this unit based on the glowing reviews and received a product that doesn't perform well at all. After trying four batches of waffles with different batter and oil types I have yet to have the first waffle not stick and break in half. Regardless of the temp setting, the batter never cooks through. Even on the highest setting I have to wait an extra minute after the buzzer sounds to open the unit without breakage. Even then, the batter is stil steaming. The unit makes a dark brown waffle with an uncooked center.The manufacturer advises that the unit should perform better but they can't replace it because it's out of stock until Spetember (it's July). This unit is being returned to Amazon for a refund.Although I may have received a defective unit, I would not recommend the unit or the manufacturer."
3,Okay product,It makes okay waffles but is very hard to clean and the batter still can stick even though it's non-stick. Use a lot of oil.
1,Waffles Split Open,"I just bought this product, hoping that a new, well-rated waffle maker wouldn't allow waffles to split open upon removal, like my previous, old waffle maker. No dice. I made 8 waffles over the course of 2 days. As to the first 4, I brushed the surface with vegetable oil, and on the other 4, I sprayed Crisco vegetable oil on the surface, in each case as per the instructions. The results: 4 split open, on 2 I had to delicately remove the waffles with precision of a surgeon, which was time-consuming, irritating and dangerous, and the other 2 came out perfect.Since my old waffle maker had this problem at the end of its life, it might be inferred that all waffle makers are deficient in this area. Or perhaps I just lack the well-honed skills necessary to remove a waffle from a waffle maker! In any case, we've give up on waffles in our house, sadly."
2,Disapointed,"After a week of research on which one too get I setteled on this one. It works great but after only a week out of the box and used 3 times the numbers are coming off. I dont know if this is a print problem or what but I was very upset for the amount of Money I paid, cant even find information to contact the Maker."
3,Poor baking time selection.,"Although this waffle iron performs quite well the selection of ""doneness"" is poor. My previous waffle maker allowed a choice of end results, this one does not."
4,Almost perfect,"Our new VillaWare waffle maker makes brunch time tasty. Its best features are its space-saving size, lightweight, attractive design, and its consistent, even cooking--nothing sticks to the grids. My only negative comment is that I don't think it cooks long enough even on its highest setting. This is remedied by leaving the waffle in a bit longer than the timer suggests, but then, what's the point in having the timer? Still, I would recommend this waffle maker."
5,Belgian Waffler,"I purchased this as a gift for a friend who is addicted to belgian waffles. Compact, convenient, and ease of use is the comment I received from the friend. Remember to apply oil/grease to the waffler and preheat for 5 min before you pour the batter, for the production of a clean, beautiful, delicious presentation."
4,Not the waffler used on Good Eats,"This waffle maker makes a very good waffle, but I had thought from the look of it that it was the one recommended by Alton Brown on his show good eats. While it looks identical from the outside, and fits all the criteria given on the show, it's a belgian waffle maker and the one from good eats is not. If you want the same waffle maker from the show, as I did, you'll have to find it elsewhere, but if you're looking to make a great belgian waffle this one will do the job nicely."
5,Villaware makes the best waflle irons,"Villaware waffle irons really are the best. Most reviewers rate this product very high and I feel the same way. This really is a great product. I am looking forward to buying a second one.My absolute favorite waffle recipe is:Plain Belgian Waffles4 eggs, separated, room temperature1 tsp. vanilla1 tbsp. sugar2 cups flour1/4 cup butter or margarine, melted and cooled2 tsp. baking powder1 cup milk1/2 tsp. saltBeat egg yolks and sugar in a bowl until light. Add cooled, melted butter or margarine, milk and vanilla extract. Add flour, baking powder and salt. Beat well. Beat egg whites until stiff and gently fold into batter.Others have said the manuals aren't on their web site, but for most of their products the manual is there. Sometimes you have to check a different product to find the information you are looking for but the information does seem to be there."
4,My mom loves it,"I got this waffler for my mom and she loves it. She told me used it quite a bit after she got it, she even experiment w/ different flavors, creating her own waffle."
5,Nice wafflemaker,"I've used mine for almost a year now and it still works very well. It is very easy to use, the surface barely needs any butter/oil if any and it wipes clean with a paper towel. The cord winds up on the bottom for easy storage. It would be nice if it had some sort of clip to keep it from flopping open when you tuck it away in the cabinet and the darkness adjustment is very easy to bump to a different setting, but it works great."
5,"Great Bargain, Terrific Performance!","This is a great waffler for the money! A little cooking spray ensures no-stick performance, but even without it, sticking isn't a problem. It wipes clean with a damp paper towel! I love the timer -- it lets you know when your waffle is done (2-4 minutes). The waffles are wonderful, and the waffler stores standing upright, taking up very little space. I am very satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend the product."
3,it's ok,"It's ok. After 4-attempt, i finally got a good result. After pouring the waffle mixture make sure spread it evenly, close lid and push the lid down, for a perfect waffle."
2,Only Cooks Waffle on One Side!,"I'm fairly stunned this waffle iron has such a high rating. I could only get it to cook waffles on one side; the second (top) side was undercooked and looked terrible. I was replacing the Cuisinart which flips over and cooks both sides perfectly.Unfortunately, after using this thing once, I ordered another Cuisinart. I'm not sure what sort of waffles people are making, but I always use the yeast-based ones that you make the night before. If that's the type of waffles you make, you'll be very disappointed with this."
4,VillaWare V2002 UNO Belgian Waffler,Really like this waffler - turns out great waffles every time...all you need to do is experiment a bit with the setting that turns them out as you like them and you'll be eating fantastic waffles. Extremely easy cleanup. The only drawback is that the lid doesn't always stay shut when stood on end for storage. I would purchase this product again.
4,Ira,"Easy to use. Cleaning is easy. Need to quickly paint surfaces with cooking oil before use to reduce sticking. Well made. Can't tell longevity of cooking surface yet.Had another brand where surface did not hold up and was difficult to clean.Makes great pancakes for the kids, especially if make the batter from scratch using their recipe."
3,Couple of problem areas.,"The slide selector feels like it's broken, although I can feel a bit of a resistance when moving it,there seems to be about 1/2"" of actual 'free play' in it which is equivalent to about one selection on the slide.The other item is that it is very flimsy when standing up for storage. The slightest jar and it will open itself up....just a couple of degrees and it will open itself. I have put a heavy rubber-band over the two handles to 'lock' it in place. My waffles are coming out very soft and pliable, even on the max. setting, but this may be a matter of my batter being to thin. Other than the above, it's a cute little Appliance and I look forward to using it."
5,VillaWare V2002 UNO Belgian Waffler-Round,I read reviews of this Waffle Maker- some quite negative about the buzzer used to tell you that the waffle is done. I find it great- the buzzer tells you the exact time to remove the waffle when its done perfectly! I make waffles with Bisquick that as good as any restaurant. (and a lot cheaper to!)VillaWare V2002 UNO Belgian Waffler - Round
4,great waffles,"the waffle iron works very well---if you like your waffles a little on the crisp side, cook it longer about 30-45 seconds more after the green ready light comes on----very happy with the job it does!!"
4,pretty darn good,"Followed the tips given by other reviewers. Made darn good waffles with just a mix. Easy clean up. If you think the beep is so annoying, you might consider eating out. I thought it was very helpful."
5,"Compact Size, Great Waffles",We have a compact kitchen and don't like large countertop appliances. This waffle maker is a nice size and produces great Belgian Waffles quickly. It stores compactly and is easy to use. 1/2 of each waffle is a nice serving size. Other reviews mentioned an irritating chime that signals that the waffle is ready but we found the sound to be fine.
3,Good Enough,"I like the size as I have very little space in my kitchen. The cord wraps around the bottom which is a nice feature. The waffle come out okay but for a crispier waffle I found that it needs to cook a couple of minutes past the beeping sound. What I didn't like is that the icons and print was completely wiped off as soon as I used a damp paper towel on it. This says to me that it's a cheap made in China item. Overall, the price is much too high for what it is. Whatever happened to quality control?"
3,Waffle Iron Review,"Have used it twice since purchasing it and has produced fair quality waffles. I'm still refining my recipes and the correct temperature to use. The first two times I set it on ""high"" due to a previous reviewers comments. I'm going to try lower settings to see if they come out any better. Also, going to try manually flipping the unit over during the cooking to see if it brings anymore improvements."
1,Poor Quality Control,"I'm afraid I wasn't able to judge the annoying alarm for myself, as the delivered unit had a cracked and crumbling case (the bottom is plastic), which was obviously done at the factory as the box and even the styrofoam was intact. The replacement unit just arrived, and has a broken temperature knob, again with no outside damage. So I'm sitting this one out and looking for another brand. Quality control counts, especially for an electrical product you'll expect to use for decades. Sorry Villaware, but I just can't trust it."
2,great waffles but doesn't work any more,"My daughter and her boyfriend are both chefs and she bought this waffle maker for him as a present. He already had one so she gave it to me. I tried it and never really knew when it was ready to add the batter. I've read other reviews and each state there is a signal or alarm when waffle is ready, this unit never made any noise, so I had to guess when waffle was done. The 1st time I used it, I guessed when it was done and it made a perfect waffle, delicious. The 2nd time, not so lucky, it took several attempts to get it right. Used it again to make waffles for my husband but forget to spray with cooking spray and waffle stuck but was tasty. We made another and it was great. I used it again yesterday for breakfast and it was perfect. This morning, I plugged it in and nothing happened, never heated and no lights. Very disappointing. I'm not sure my daughter still has the receipt. I think it's a piece of junk."
3,I would buy it again,The waffles were evenly browned but found the recipe with the waffler were a bit bland. I need to find a better waffle recipe with a richer flavored batter.
1,Don't Buy This,"Save yourself time and money and do not buy this. I took it out of its box and the first thing I noticed is the 'funny' smell of plastic,etc that seems to be in everything made in China that's rubber,plastic, etc. The metal lid is scratched and roughly made. I'm not going to use it. I've already processed this for return through Amazon and am going to purchase the US made waffle maker though it's about $100 more. That's my '2 cents'. Thank you"
2,Art work not so great,"If you glance at his art work it looks pretty good. But, once I started studying his work, its just not as good as allot of other artists out their currently."
3,Dorian - Visions,Extreme terror fantasy art. Lots of images to look at three or four times the most to get the feel of the weird content.worth while reading.
3,He practiced too much,"It's hard to believe that the other reviewers of this disc have heard many other pianists play the Bm Sonata. This is an extremely overwrought performance. I can believe that he took ten years preparing for it--he prepared way too much! He tries to wring every bit of corny emotion he can from the piece. Oh, sure, it's technically dazzling and all that (though how people can separate ""technique"" from ""musicality"" is beyond me), but it's just overdone. Horowitz and Argerich are much better (and cheaper!) I'm sorry to have bought this disc. What I'm really waiting for is Evgeny Kissin's version. I heard him play it in Sevilla a couple of years ago, and it was the most thrilling piano recital I have heard in over forty years of attending concerts."
5,I LIke it,"Of the 14/15(Some CD's have a bonus track by Appolo 440 and Morphine) tracks on this CD only 1 sucks. _Incredible_ !! IMHO the best tracks are Korn/Dust Bros. (Kick the PA) , Incubus/DJ Greyboy(Familiar) , and Skin up Pin UP by Mansun and 808 State"
4,One hell of an album,"Spawn: The Album is probably one of the best Movie Soundtracks ever created. It has some really great songs with some very popular bands like Metalica, Stabbingwestward ect. One of the best songs is from Maryln Mansion, this is also one of the finest piece of Elektronica(Ithink that's what you call it)music ever made in an album.I won't go into detail except that this is a very underrated album and has some great songs and some very popular bands. It also has a song from Incubus that is acctually pretty damn good.The guys who put this Album together did a terrific job and I must say that the Spawn Album is one of the only thing that wasn't a dissapointment about this film...Go get it..4.7 out of 5Lates"
3,A pretty good CD,"Some of these tracks are truly outstanding. The Marilyn Manson and Sneeaker Pimps track, the Stabbing Westward and Wink track, and the Incubus and DJ Greyboy track are addictive. It seems that the electronica artists really bring out the beauty in some rough cut bands, giving the dark music a haunting atmosphere.Other tracks, though, are regrettable. Filter doesn't quite sound right for ""Can't You Trip like I Do"", and the fact that Metallica is on a couple of tracks.Otherwise, though, its great."
4,Experimental yet effective.,"I've been a Regular reader of Spawn comic since the mere beginning, ergo i had to watch the movie, back in the day (1997) the movie was half baked, a real shame becouse it was my favorite character at the time, but this not so good movie carried one of the best soundtracks i've ever heard.. to be honest for me is plain just the best one.The idea of putting together one Rock/Metal band and one Techno/Electronica in each song made some interesting results, Having names like Metallica, Filter, Marilyn Manson, Moby, Incubus, korn, Silverchair, The Crystal Method, Sneaker Pimps, slayer, Roni Size, and so much others its almost imposible to fail to at least make a couple of songs to your play lists.by now 14 years later it might not call upon the masses, but if u recognize any of the artists on the list give it a shot, maybe you will find a new album to love."
3,a fusion of synth and metal,"This is a good soundtrack. ""Trip like I Do"" was the main reason I got it. I found out I got a lot more too. Marilyn Manson with Sneaker Pimps, Orbital and Kirk Hammet, Butthole Surfers and Moby, Metallica and DJ Spooky. All these tracks are good. It starts to wind down and lose steam with the last couple of tracks but this is a good investment. If you enjoy the musical fusion of different styles than check this out, also check out the Judgement Night soundtrack"
5,One Of The Best Soundtracks I've Ever Heard,"The Spawn soundtrack is great. It's a perfect blend of techno and rock music. ""(Can't You) Trip Like I Do"", ""Long Hard Road Out of Hell"", ""Kick the P.A."", and ""Familiar"" are amazing tracks. I can't get enough of them. Check out the Spawn soundtrack if you want to hear some great music."
4,if you like industral..GET THIS,"i love albums like this. i love when artists get together and mix and match. it can be pure magic. this album has a couple of gems. MARILYN MANSON & THE SNEAKER PIMPS have my favorite song in LONG HARD ROAD OUT OF HELL. their is also SILVERCHAIR & VITRO, ATARI TEENAGE RIOT & SLAYER, KORN with THE DUST BROTHERS to name a few of the good ones. there are a couple of lackluster tunes but only a couple. most of this album rocks. i think the artists here retain their signature music while adding some intersting stuff. TOM MORELLO with PRODIGY gets some intersting results so if you like the genre of electronica i highly recommend this album.email danny@ milkboydanny@hotmail.com"
4,It could have been better,"I bought this because of Kick The P.A. which is the best song. There are about only four other songs I like. I was hoping for some better songs, but it is still cool."
2,"An interesting idea, but........","I was expecting this to be a pretty good album, with the concept of two bands doing one song. You have good groups like ""Filter"", ""The Crystal Method"", ""Orbital"", ""Prodigy"", and ""Incubus"" on this album, and unfortunately, that's the only songs that are good. The one exception is ""Skin Up Pin Up"" by Mansun & 808 State. I've never heard of either group, but there contribution is one excellent rock song. Most of the other tracks have the dark edge of the movie, but they just don't work. This album proves that just because it has certain big name groups, it doesn't mean it's good."
3,Saved by a few awesome tracks,"If this album was stripped of bands like Korn, Marilyn Manson, Slayer, Crystal Method and Stabbing Westward, this album would suck the tail pipe badly. Like said before, too many weak songs. Too many songs to skip by. But thanks to those bands, you do have a cd worth buying. If Korn's ""Kick The P.A."" and Manson's ""Long Hard Road Out Of Hell"" aren't good enough reasons for you to buy this album , then I recommend passing this by."
2,HATED IT,"I hate this cd, I dont think hate is a strong enough word, I despised it and I mourn the loss of the precious money I spent on it. There are only 1.5 good songs on this cd. Marilyn and manson, and stabbing westward, saved this cd from becoming a frisbee, or coaster, or something more useful. BUY A REAL PIECE OF HARD ROCK LIKE TOOL, OR A REAL ELECTRONICA/DANCE ALBUM LIKE THE TRAINSPOTTING SOUNTRACK. YUCK! IT WAS JUST TERRIBLE."
1,Disappointment,"The film was pretty good, but the music was terrible. If you like spawn and would like to listen to spawn-related music check out Iced Earth's 'Dark Saga'. This song compilation is rather poor."
5,just a great and funny movie,"This movie rocked. There were so many countless funny moments in the movie, that i had to see it twice."
1,Dirty Work,"This movie stinks, Norm Macdonld wasn't funny and the jokes were terrible. I use to like Norm but after seeing this film I never want to watch another of his movies again. "" On the bright side Chris Farley is in it."
4,Great Picture Quality,"Since every other review here is discussing the film, you obviously get the plot. However what is not mentioned is how good this film looks in HD Upscaling. It has bright colours and clothing (not unlike the latter Kevin Smith films) that look really sharp and has really nice clarity for a low budget comedy. So if you are looking for a decent comedy to show off your new HD home theatre system and truly want to see how good upscaling can look then I recommend this.I watched Forrest Gump upscaled the next day and Dirty Work actually looked better in my opinion. Its not a better movie by any stretch of the imagination but it is a superior DVD transfer."
3,Dirty Work,"First off I would like to make the point that I love this movie perfectly clear. It is in my oppinion one of the funniest and most underrated movies of all time. The reason that I gave the DVD 3 stars is for the simple lack of features. Much like Happy Gilmore on DVD, the movie is great, but the extras are just lame. I just want to make it clear one final time that I thought that this movie rocked.. if you want a great movie that will have you laughing out loud then look no further than Dirty Work; but if you are looking for a great DVD with lots of extras this may not be for you."
3,Artie Lange is hot,"I thought Dirty Work was funny. There are alot worse things you can watch than this movie. Besides, Norm and Artie are nice to look at."
3,"Funny, but Mcdonald is annoying","""Note to self""....that is probably the most spoken sentence in this movie. It is about two guys who open up a ""revenge business"" (to do peoples dirty work for them) in order to save their father. A funny movie, but it gets pretty stupid at times. I'm not a fan of Norm Macdonald, but if you are, this movie is a must."
2,"Funny, stupid, sick, and revolting to all mankind","""Dirty Work"" is one of those revolting comed films you love to see. It costars Chevy Chase, Chris Farley, Christopher MacDonald, and John Goodman. The storyline: Revenge, whores, doctors,whores, and oh yeah whores. That's all it talks about is whores and it gets real old real fast. Though there are some amusing moments. But they are wide spread and few. If you are ready for sick comedy about sex, whores, and revenge. You should see this one-joke comedy."
5,this movie kicks ass!,"norm macdonald has a gift that will never be matched by anyone. he wrote most of this movie, explaining why it is so funny. watch the norm show. one more thing, if you say you don't like this movie, you have no soul. this is a great party movie, even though the dvd doesn't have much extra to offer. we love you norm! ps, email me to talk"
5,Oh my filth flarn filth gosh darn tootin shnikies,"This piece of brilliant American art is the embodiment of toilet humor at its purest level of simple, raunchy, and fulfilling venality. Stimulating on a wavelength that makes every person that has seen it not only willing, but eager to watch it over and over again (results = unpolished laughter every single time)."
4,Norm MacDonald kicks!,"If you like Norm MacDonald and his work on SNL, you will love Dirty Work. It has tons of laughable jokes and many funny cameo appearences from Chris Farley, Gary Coleman, Adam Sandler, and John Goodman. It is about two friends who start a revenge for hire business. It is loaded with laughs, and Norm does a good job in his first starring role."
5,Genius,"This movie is really funny. If you loved screwed and half baked you will love this film. Its about these two guys who find out there brothers and their dad needs a new heart which cost $50,000 which so they have to do this job where they get revenge. Norm Macdonald and Artie Lange are histarical. They really did a great job. The only weird thing about this is Bob Saget directed it. I hate his jokes because he is a terrible comedian. I mean cmon dude Bob Saget, more like Bob Faget. Get it heh heh heh ahhh I an idiot. Anyways this movie is really great you havent seen it you got to watch it. Even if you look at it and go ""ahhh it looks ok but, ehhhh.."", but trust me its funny."
5,One of the funniest movies of all time,"Norm MacDonald is just plain hilarious. I've been a fan of his since back in the old SNL days, and this is his masterpiece. The story centers around Norm and his best friend (Artie Lang) needing to get $50,000 for Artie's father to get a heart transplant. After several failed attempts at earning the money from regular jobs, they decide to open up a revenge for hire business and hilarity ensues. This movie also features brief appearances by Chevy Chase, Adam Sandler, Gary Coleman, and Chris Farley. If you are at all a fan of Norm MacDonald or just comedies in general, I would highly recommend this comic masterpiece."
5,Norm MacDonald Is A Genius At Revenge,"If you have not seen this movie, turn off your computer, get off your ass, start the car and drive to the video store now. Get yourself a copy of this DVD, as you will not be let down. The part that cracks me up is when Mitch (Norm) and Sam are working at the movie theatre and put in a movie reel called ""Men In Black...Who Like To Have Sex With Each Other"". The only reason this is funny is because Mitch says, ""Note to self...Sam just looked at the screen."" Anyways, you will want this movie. Chris Farley also makes a cameo appearance in it as well."
4,You Either Get Norm Or You Don't,"I kind of tuned out of ""SNL"" after years of mediocrity so I missed Norm MacDonald's time on it. I do remember the short lived ""Norm Show"" and I liked it a lot. I also dug Norm's guest appearance as Chubby Junior on ""My Name Is Earl"" where he played the son of Burt Reynolds' strip club owner. Though far from uninspired ""Dirty Work"" isn't what I would call classic comedy but it get's by on the good vibes that Norm emits. Norm's style of humor I would characterize as droll though some would call it smarmy. Regardless, the success or failure of the film falls on your reaction to Norm and he's alright by me. Great supporting cast led by Artie Lange as Norm's best bud, Jack Warden as Lange's father, Chevy Chase as a gambling addicted surgeon, and the late Chris Farley in an extended cameo as a guy who gets part of his nose bit off by a Vietnamese hooker. I laughed sporadically throughout but not consistently but you could do a whole lot worse."
3,"Very funny concept, not the best but worth renting","I definitely got a kick out of watching this movie. At times the plot is a little contrived and predictable, but the gags make it worth watching. The hookers in the trunks was one of the funniest things I've seen. Considering the movie got a PG-13 rating, Norm must have had to have cut back on some of his raunchier material. Note to self: The scene where Norm is tripping while driving has to be one of the most absurd, hysterical scenes ever filmed. ""We eat the pig and then we burn!"""
2,"Enough jokes for an SNL skit, not a movie.","Though I still think Norm MacDonald was the funniest Weekend Update anchor Saturday Night Live ever had, he didn't put his best foot forward in this movie, where he opens up a revenge-for-hire business. One payback involves dead fish. Another one involves, guess what, dead fish. Yet another one seems absolutely creative in comparison, utilizing skunks. What originality! MacDonald's pal Sam (Artie Lange) gives such an awkward reading of his ""serious"" lines that I wonder if someone picked randomly off the street could have done better. Chris Farley appears in a few scenes, but isn't given much to do. Not even the bloopers that roll during the credits are funny. If you like Ernest movies but wish they had more raunchy humor, ""Dirty Work"" might be for you."
3,Ridiculous,"Yes I did laugh very hard at this movie, but it is absoulutely ridiculous. ""Hello? real cops?"", I mean that is just completely unecessary and if you have seen it then you know what I am talking about. Chris Farley also once again displays his overwhelming self respect by a guy who had his nose bit off by a saigon whore....(sigh).....But it does get the job done and I laughed very hard. If you like this movie you should watch Norm's sitcom wich has the same character who plays his best friend in the movie. You will also have many opportunities to hear the word ""crack"" and ""whore"" many times."
1,Did not recieve.,"i was never sent the film, the company emailed me and said they had sent the movie, but i never received it."
1,Deserving of 0 stars,"First off--this is supposed to be a comedy and I can only remember genuinely laughing once. Second, this movie is terribly sexist in its use (or should I say misuse) of ""whores"" and portrayal of women in general throughout the film. Terrible plot, not funny, and is full of sexist themes... I still cannot believe that such a talented group of comedians produced such a terrible film."
4,Inspiring,"This CD is everything I'd hoped it would be - Auger has the voice of an angel, the entire production is magnificent."
2,Great bits and great mistakes,"Defiantly old fashioned, not always very well sung despite a good team of soloists, Bernstein's view of this unfinished masterwork veers from the insightful to the ordinary. It may be worth hearing once for the insights, but the rest - and that's a good 60% - will pall very quickly. Best avoided by all but Bernstien's most faithful fans."
2,Greatest ever?,"This is the third recording of this work I have purchased. The first was an excellent version on cassette (Leppard, Te Kanawa, etc on Seraphim) that, unfortunately, I cannot find on CD. This is the second mediocre CD of this work I have tried attempting to find a good one. This is not it! Bernstein conducts this like he wants to finish before lunch. The soloists are unspectacular and the whole thing is kind of a mess. Bernstein produced many great recordings, but this is definitely not one of them."
2,a displeased choral fan,"As one would expect from Bernstein, this is a technically well done performace on the orchestra's part. However, a choral conductor he is not, and the chorus' work in this recording lacks a great deal. Both the Kyrie and Jesu Christe are ponderous where they should be intense, and the ...Sancto is disjointed rather than dancing through the runs. The Qui Tollis has wretched balance between the double choirs, and the chorus in the Gloria is overridden by an intrusive bass drum.As an alternative, I recommend John Eliot Gardiner's recording with the Monteverdi Choir. The solos could perhaps be improved, but the choral movements are unmatched by any other recording."
5,Great for a Bruins fan,"Bought the bedroom set and these valances for my grandson. He loves them. He loves the Bruins and hockey, 6 years old. Room looks great"
3,Disappointment,"When I first saw this ring online I was like ""omg it's a must have."" After reading the reviews from other people I thought this would be a very good deal. It arrived on time and looked like the picture but the size was too big and it was bent a little bit. Now after wearing it only a few days its whorped even more. Overall, this purchase was not the best, but I still wear it anyways even with the flaws."
3,not quite like picture,"I really like the customer service, and the box it comes in is absolutely adorable...however, the ring is not at all what I expected. A little smaller than I expected, and the top...well, the little circle thing with the knot inside? Well, it juts out so far, that it reminds me of one of those Egyptian signet rings. I almost dipped it in wax to see if it would leave an imprint on an envelope! The design is great, except for the fact that the top juts out and I haven't gotten any compliments on it, except for my Mom's. Ah, I would not really recommend this ring, unless you wouldn't mind it looking like a signet ring. It is real silver, though, and very glossy and shiny, so I would give it a three star rating. Just my personal opinion."
5,Celtic Trinity,"This ring is exactly what I wanted, I actually bought another and it wasn't quite as solidly made as this ring is. Thanks for the great ring!"
5,Intriged by Trinity,"Since many years I have been attracted by the celtic designs in jewellery. I am a Churchmusician, and when I could combine the celtic Trinity with a piece of jewellery my preference for symbolism was complete. This was twenty years ago; so I was very happy to find these two (ring and cross pendant)pieces in your online shop to extend my collection."
5,Best price and just what I needed,"This fixed the problem of intermittant dash lights in my son's 2001 Tahoe. Amazon has the best price around for this part. It is very easy to install, just pop the plastic dash frame loose, unplug the wires, snap out the old part, snap in the new, reconnect and put it back together. Its a ten minute job."
5,Part corrected dashboard light problem in 2002 Silverado,"The dashboard lights stopped working on my husbands '02 Chevy Silverado 2500. He checked with the dealership, and they said it was probably this item that failed. The dealership wanted over twice the price offered through Amazon. We ordered the part and my husband installed it and everything works fine."
5,Excellent Transaction,"Recieved on time, and it was the correct part. Great working with this company. I also liked how Amazon has it set up to guarantee that I'm picking the right part for the correct automobile."
2,not the best of Sesame Street,"Maybe this DVD is better to watch than absolutely nothing, but this one's a dud. I got this because my kid loves Sesame Street ""Alphabet Challenge"" and ""Kids' Favorite Country Songs."" Those two titles keep my son's full attention and he even bops along to the music. My son ran away within 5 minutes of this starting. Lame. Hubby agrees. We'll stick to Alphabet Challenge and Country Songs."
5,Get off the beaten track,"Be sure to look for the newer edition (2003) as it covers 70 small towns. I started out thinking I would just dip into this, and read a few pages here and there. Then it turned out to be so interesting with Florida history, local tidbits, interesting people and architecture, that I read it straight through.Now I can't wait to visit Havana to see the antique shops or to see the 36 murals in Lake Placid.Some of the towns merely have interesting names (Yeehaw Junction) or a single sight, but many sound worthwhile for a day trip or longer visit. Probably should keep this book in the car while in Florida and check it occasionally to see if you are near any of these interesting places.It is arranged by regions (north, central and south),"
3,Nice treatment of needed topic,"I bought the book because I am from Small-Town Florida. The descriptions are quite accurate, although sometimes more detail would be nice. I am glad he included Two Egg, but I question Seaside instead of Seagrove or Grayton. Yeehaw Junction was a necessary inclusion, and his description of the Bok Tower Gardens at Lake Wales is spot on! When you come to Florida, and leave the beaten path (Interstate 75), the Gardens is place everyone should visit. It is as close to Heaven as you will get in Florida."
4,Good,"Really nice. It takes a standpoint of symbolism, not mysticism. Idk if im using the right words, but oh well. I hope you get what I mean. Like, it doesnt say that tarot is fortune telling, but rather, just a way to get advice. And it explains a lot of stuff, especially the symbolism parts. But I agree with the book that every reader should make up their own meanings. That's the beauty of symbolism. If you see the DEATH card as DEATH, then DEATH it is. But if you see it as REBIRTH, the that is what it is. Meanings change. Take the swastika for example. It can mean something completely different from [extreme] national socialism as seen in the Western world, to a meaning related to Buddhism in the Eastern world."
2,bubble gum tarot,"I agree with the statements made by ""pete"". The book starts out fairly informative, then the description of the cards is simply a hodgepodge of phrases. This could be ok, if it was also accompanied by a full description of the true symbolism of the card. I am completely new to this art, and found most of the book ""unreadable"". It is only useful, IMHO, as a reference during a reading. If that's the way you would like to learn, this is the book for you, I prefer a book you can dig into. Overall it did not strike a chord with me."
5,A delight to read ... clear and illuminating,"I have read many books on the Tarot, but this one stands out for its clarity and erudition. Anyone starting on the road to Tarot would benefit from this fine guide. I recommend it highly."
4,Very Thorough and Easy to Understand Card Interpretations,"I agree with an earlier post that the wide variety of meanings given for each card can be a little overwhelming for the beginner. However, I also think that this same feature helps beginners to stay open to the possibility of different interpretations and encourages beginners (as the author does explicitly) to find through experience their own meanings for the cards.I started learning the Tarot several years ago relying heavily on this book as one of my primary resources. It's a great reference book to have on hand for its thorough card interpretations. My only two complaints are (1) There are a few typos in the section explaining the Celtic Cross spread, which could lead to confusion; and (2)There isn't enough explanation for how beginners can learn to integrate all the meanings in a spread to give a unified and coherent reading."
5,Clear as Day,"This was my first Tarot book, although I had been searching many different options, this book seemed like my best buy. I was correct. It has an easy-to-read feel and has everything you need to know."
5,IF YOU BUY JUST ONE TAROT BOOK-BUY THIS ONE,"I'm serious. This book is incredible. I have bought a ton of books on tarot that claimed to be for beginers and plain and simple. They ALWAYS left me confused. But not this one. It is really plain, I mean really easy to understand. I love the section on the use of numerology and astrology in the book as well. Truely opened my eyes, and a lot of the time I could be heard stting in the corner reading it going,""Oh, okkkk now I understand."" I must say a million praises to the author for the clarity and ease in which in this book reads. If you a beginer- GET THIS BOOK AND SAVE YOURSELF A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY AND TIME."
5,Great Buy for my Jeep SRT8 Grand Cherokee,I bought this radiator cap in hopes that it would help my 2010 Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8 keep from spraying coolant all over the engine bay. It works like a charm and I haven't had one problem since install.
3,great concert presented in bad video editing!!,"a good concert video presents the artists' talents by showing the right scenes at the right time...as showing the right instrument at the right moment it is being played or going solo. this video does not present uriah heep's talents in to a good show--including ian anderson's performance. when watching the concert, you kinda worry when the camera shifts to someone else while someone else is doing his solo piece--or it even goes into a rehearsal clip. in one song, mick box's complete guitar solo was substituted with a rehearsal scene!! that was a rip...--and bad for mick too.as a concert--this is one of uriah heep's best so far--but presented with poor video editing and bad camera work!!"
3,Ok product,I have oily skin and it tends to become very greasy.. I tried Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne wash. My skin instantly became very dry after use leading to a more oily skin in a short time. It seemed like my skin ended up secreting more oil because my skin was so dry. I tried the Acne Stress control cleanser from Neutrogena and loved that product more as compared to this one.
3,Schubert String Qu intet in C,Music itself gorgeous. But why is another recording I have of this have 15 minutes left filled with a Rondo which is delightful while this disk which takes approximately the same amount of time for the quintet has nothing to complete it?
4,Very Fine Schubert,"The Emersons play very well within the grand tradition of Schubert performance. It may not be an essential CD, but it is very good and rewards repeated listening. The technical quality of the CD is excellent. Although recorded ""live,"" there is no noticeable intrusion from the audience."
5,sublime beauty,"the string quintet in c , d. 956 is sublimely beautiful especially the slow movements . His death and the maiden was my favourite piece of chamber music until i heard this on the radio and I was entranced by its beauty and could not wait until i had my own cd . The musicians are all truly skilled crafts men and perform this piece extremely well . Before i brought this particular cd i listened to several versions before finally settling on this particular recording . I can heartly recommend this cd to any music lover ."
3,Supergroup fallacy strikes again,"I listened to this once a few years ago. I found it emotionally and sonically thin.This is one of the greatest, deepest, most beautiful, pieces ever written, and a favorite of every string player.This performance misses the depth and the magic of Schubert.The Emersons, who are superb instrumentalists, are such technical players and seem to be such control freaks that they are unable to let themselves be taken over by the music. Adding the world's most eminent cellist didn't help.In any case you owe it to yourself and to Schubert to check out as many recordings of this great piece as possible, and, more importantly, to hear it performed in person, the only way to really understand a piece this magical."
5,Required for native/history majors and everyone else in N.A.,"This book is a methodically brings the legal thought of the western world into context of how it relates to the American Indian, a necessary background to the subject. This is done by reviewing medival and reform period of history, the seperation of church and state and land laws, and followed up by the occupation of North America. How this subjecation came to be and how laws not used equally facilitated the holocast in North America. I am glad i read it and have considered doing a second MA at the institution Robert A Williams teaches and have bought his second book and look forward to reading it AFTER i reread the american indian in western legal thought (ps keep a dictionary handy)."
2,The shotgun approach to deep musical structure,"A pompous and confused application of category theory to music.The math is advanced, and so is the obscurity of the encyclopedic and voluminous prose. This is a pity, since Mazzola makes a number of fascinating and deep observations. Fighting through the dense, barely edited, text to find these gems, however, is an activity best left to the most masochistic of PhD candidates in music theory, especially given the heft and price of the book."
5,An excellent account,"Most recordings of the Turangalila symphony is actually more than worthwhile, but this is definitely one of the front runners. It is less white-hot and emotionally energetic than some of the competitors - on the other hand more detailed and texturally transparent; it is also somewhat quicker, being fitted onto one disc, but insofar as it never sounds rushed, this is no objection. The soloists are also less prominent than on alternative recordings, being more integrated parts of the orchestra than competing against it, something I find advantageous. If I have any objection to the interpretation, it must be that the account can be just a little to soft and gentle sometimes; not analytically cool, but a little tentative (the finale in particular). But the ''Jardin du sommeil d'amour'' is the most beautiful I've heard.. Sound quality is a little distant, but perfectly acceptable. All in all, this is an excellent account and easily recommendable."
1,I Don't get....,"why prior books that are far better researched have the lifespan of milk, while Goldberg who's story is surely contrived, gets five star reviews. Seems like working at The New Yorker and Washington Post trumps...Danny Rubenstein's ""The People of Nowhere""Amira Hass' ""Drinking the Sea at Gaza""and Wendy Orange' ""Coming Home to Jerusalem""...and many others who were deeply engaged journalists drop off the book list. Surely these now out of print books covered the same turf but none are connected to Goldberg's. WHY? Is it all about connections and pr? I think yes. What do you think?"
5,Prisoners by Jerry Goldberg,"This is a must for anyone Jew, Muslim gentile (like me) who despairs at the Israeli/Palestinian problem to be confirmed in the view that there are people of good will on both sides where common humanity exists but unfortunately frustrated by those in power who believe that force is the only way forward"
5,MAKE GENTLE THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD,"Throughout the 1960s, Robert F. Kennedy personally recorded ideas, ideals, and principles that spoke to his mind and his heart in a private journal. Now, thirty years after Robert's tragic death, his son Maxwell Taylor Kennedy has drawn from both this journal and his father's speeches to offer the quintessence and the depth of his thinking. Filled with energy and insight, Make Gentle the life of this World is the invigorating and thought - provoking portrait of a mind that shaped a generation and of a man who lived for his country. Beautifully illustrated with photos both public and private, some published here for the first time, Make Gentle the Life of This World commemorates how Robert F. Kennedy touched our hearts and quickened our lives."
4,A definite treasure for people who believed in Bobby's work,"The book, ""Make Gentle the Life of This World,"" is a phenomenal piece of work. There's no doubt that Maxwell Kennedy had a challenging task in compiling this book - but his hard work has paid off as the book provides us with so much insight about Bobby's way of thinking. For those who admired the passion of Bobby, and for those who have an appreciation of literature and philosophy, will most definitely enjoy this book. Though there are times when I wish there was more writings or thoughts directly from Bobby as opposed to his sources. Nevertheless, it is an inspiring piece of work."
5,"Excellent product, and good customer support","Three years so far and still going strong, saved my hiney quite a few times so far - we get allot of power problems at my place, maybe one every week at least.One of the best PC related investments I ever made."
5,Worked right out of the box!,"I was hesitant on getting this battery pack and was almost ready to purchase new phones for my home, but at that price I just had to try.I received the batteries in record time and after charging a full night, I now have my phones fully working again! Awesome!"
5,good item,thanks for the prompt and good service. they seem to be the ticket and were hard to find in the small town I am from
1,Used battery sold at high price,It's a badly used battery and could not be charged. Don't know why it's packaged in a new item package - very deceiving. You could see the deposits accumulated at the negative end of the battery. Charged overnight and for a couple of days it ran out as fast as the handset is removed from the base. Totally dissatisfied.
5,Does the job,Just what I needed! Replaced a worn out battery; now my phone doesn't die until after a long period of use.
2,Did not solve my problem,"The battery did not restore my phone to working order so I'm not sure what the problem was, but I just bought a new phone. Don't know if the battery was defective or it was the phone itself. Can I return it?"
5,OEM is the way to go!,"I was looking to buy the Energizer replacement for our Panasonic KX-TGA242W cordless phone which wasn't holding a charge anymore. After reading those reviews, I decided to go with the OEM Panasonic HHR-P105 battery simply because we've had these phones for approximately 3 years or more and just now the Panasonic battery in one phone has died! That's pretty good quality as far as batteries go.The only problem was that I needed an HHR-P105 battery, and all I could find on here was HHR-P105A. I decided to take a chance, because they appeared to be the same battery on the packaging. Also, after looking around, this battery price was substantially less than going to Radio Shack or Best Buy, and they don't have Panasonic brand either. When it arrived, I charged it a full 24 hours and good as new! The phone works like new again. Here's hoping to another 3 years plus of regular use before we have to order again!"
1,Not the same,"The old battery to our phone that it came with lasted over 4 years! We finally had to replace it and we are already seeing signs that this battery is going out! It has not even been a year yet!!!UPDATE - A YEAR AFTER PURCHASE:Not only is this ""new"" battery not lasting near as long... but also our phone has not worked right since we got it. I finally broke downs and called customer support for my phone and after 20 minutes of trouble shooting we figured out... the battery is causing all of the problems.Now to even view our caller ID screen we have to remove the battery and put it back in... works for a short while and then we have to do it again.FYI - the problems with the phone only occur when the battery charge is one bar on our phone. Battery works fine when it is fully charged...although after just one year we can't keep the phone charged because the battery is giving out already!NOT BUYING BATTERY HERE AGAIN! WILL ORDER DIRECT FROM PANASONIC!"
5,great battery,this is all i needed to fix my cordless phone good price top notch battery buy with cofidence ! would buy again !
5,PAnasonic replacement battery for cordless Panasonic phone,Excellent product. I have used it for a month and it seems to be working perfectly. I will highly recommend it.
3,"Excellent product, work right out",I am giving 3 stars becasue of shipping. The product was ship 3 days after the order.
4,"A little flimsy, but a winner for taking pictures outside","I have had to replace my Delkin sunscreen 2-3 times, as the little ""feet"" eventually break off with lots of use--still they are well worth it. I just bought several so I'll have a replacement handy. They are very effective in permitting one to see the LCD screen in sunlight and on bright days."
4,Fascinating novel about Eskimos - by a man who'd never met one!,"This novel was the basis for a movie called ""The Savage Innocents"" starring Anthony Quinn (1961). It is about Inuk, an Inuit Eskimo, who has had little contact with white men. At a trading post, Inuk accidentally kills a missionary, who insulted him by refusing the traditional Inuit (sexual) hospitality of wife-sharing. The main theme is the Eskimos' survival in the extreme arctic wilderness, as well as their raw existence and struggle to maintain their lifestyle against encroaching civilization. I enjoyed this book even though I found out later that the writer never actually met an Eskimo!"
5,"Top of the World, Revisited.","I read this several decades ago and was moved by the narrative, the apparent authenticity, and the stark reality of life in the arctic. In particular, I was interested in the effect and the hypocrisy of the Chrisitan missionaries attempting to convert the inuit people. The amazing thing was that the author had never visited that area. There are lessons to be learned by anyone interested in cultures foreign to most of us. It should be reprinted."
1,This book made me cry!!,"Please before you buy this book, know that the method is to let your child cry themselves to sleep. Babies need their parents. All a baby knows is that they need someone to be with them. When a child cries him/her self to sleep night after night all they learn is that mommy or daddy does not care if I scream. They learn to shut down and not even ask for help. Crying is a babies way of saying they need something.There are ways to get your children to sleep. Try Nighttime Parenting By William Sears. I had a child who woke a lot and I know where you are coming from but all this book does is teach you to turn off your feelings when your child screams. it is horrible listening to them scream. Their cries are supposed to bring us to them."
1,They Are Called Needs For A Reason,"A baby has needs that this book completely ignores in a way that can be harmful to the infant's physical and emotional development.Most pediatricians would not recommend letting a newborn go more than 3 to 4 hours without eating. Many older babies wake up hungry at night as well. To ignore a baby's need to be fed is equivalent to neglect.A baby also needs to have his cries answered to learn that he can depend on and trust his parents. To ignore this need is to teach your baby that you cannot be trusted,and that the world is a frightening place. Ignoring an infant's need for emotional comfort and security is neglectful at best, abusive at worst.Parents who care about their children's needs will be better off using the methods in Elizabeth Pantley's ""The No-Cry Sleep Solution""."
1,"Alone in the dark, my cries unanswered...NOT a solution!","The only thing that crying yourself to sleep does for your baby is make him tense, nervous, anxious and insecure. Not only does this method NOT work, but you have to repeat it every time your child goes through any kind of developmental change. Try ""The No Cry Sleep Solution"" by Elizabeth Pantley. I got my unsleeping child to sleep using her methods with no tears and no problems. She has continued to sleep beautifully ever since, even through teething...and 2 years later she sleeps 12 hours at night and 2 hours at nap with total peace & happiness."
3,Some Good Advice But Out of Date,"The book offers some sound advice on how to get your child to learn to sleep. The charting of their sleep is really helpful when you're so tired you can't remember what happens from day to day. HOWEVER, we actually had an appointment with the doctor who wrote this, as we were concerned with how few hours our child slept. His answer was that the book was written 15 years ago, is out of date on a lot of data, and that our child's sleep was in the range of normal! So don't take as gospel any of the guidelines on your child's sleep habits. They're just not reliable anymore."
4,It really does work!,"I have 9 months twins and My wife and I were just frustrated. On average, we used to spend around 1.5 hours just to put our kids to sleep not including the time before putting kids to sleep like bathing our kids, change diapters, feeding them etc and then also they would get up atleast couple of times during night.After reading just couple of chapters and putting the techniques at work, we are suprised and satisified with the results. Our kids now know how to put themselves to sleep on their own and do not get up even once during entire night. That also gives a full-night sound sleep.Thank you Dr.ferber. I recommended this book to any parent who is strugglign with kids' sleep problems."
5,LOVED this book - I'm SLEEPING and so is our baby.,"I must say that I was very wary of this book. I was adamantly opposed to any methods that used CIO. After unsuccessfully exhausting all the non-CIO methods... I reluctantly picked up this book at the urging of our pediatrician. I was surprised and grateful and the plain language and TOTAL SENSE of this book. I felt great about the method ""controlled crying"" and our daughter was sleeping through the night in TWO DAYS! She was sleeping at a regular bedtime withing A WEEK!! She was taking regular naps within 2 WEEKS!! My husband and I couldn't believe it. We are happier and our daughter is happier. We can plan to do things better because we know when her naptime/bedtime is and can be sure when she is ready to play and be alert.This book is short, to the point -- written expertly for that sleep-deprived, frazzled and concerned parent....AND covers the whole range of adolescent sleeping problems. If I could give this book a higher rating I would!"
2,i disagree,"In this Ferber book, it seems as if this man wants to help us solve sleep problems our kids ma have, but in all reality he is coming up with solutions that are outdated and not backed with enough scientific information to make me do this to my kids. Ferber tries to reassure us that its okay to make our kids cry for increments at a time and make them feel as if no one really cares. This is an outdated book for a time when we need a more gentle approach to putting our kids to bed. They are really only children, and when we make them think that their parents aren't there for them anymore, who will they be able to trust? People follow Dr. Ferber's method when they are tired of nurturing their kids to sleep. Maybe this works for some stubborn kids, but for the most part, I think this book is a bad neglectful way to deal with a child that has a sleeping problem."
5,healthy security,"This is probably the way to go for most parents! And it appears to be very healthy for children. We used it for our son. We put him down sleepy, and came to reassure him that we were there and that everything was ok. In only a few days he was allowing himself to drift off to sleep when we put him in the crib. I am so glad I did this when he was still an infant. We have been sleeping through since he was 2 1/2 months. At eight years old, he knows when he's tired, his likes his room and his bed because it is a cozy, secure place that he enjoys. He has learned, just as we adults have, that BED equals SLEEP and sleep is good. And Mom & Dad will always come for him. That's healthy security as I see it."
5,Wonderful,"With my first child I tried letting him ""cry it out"" at about 4 months with no success. It was misery. Then I read this book and understood sleep, where our problem seemed to lie and a reasonable game plan that wasn't so cruel. It worked great immedicately and after a few nights we were all sleeping beautifully. Since I understood sleep better with the second child bad habits didn't start. We had no problems at all. I wished I'd read it before the birth of the first child. What a waste, it could have been such a much nicer experience if I'd known. I give it to new parents as a baby gift now. I suspect they think I'm nuts since the don't have a sleep problem but I really think it is the nicest gift they could receive if they read and apply it."
4,Thank G-d for Dr. Ferber!,"My daughter went from being up and down and crying all night as well as ""needing"" to be fed, to sleeping peacefully through the night in just three days! This method may seem ""mean,"" but my baby is much happier now and understands how to put herself to sleep. I highly recommend this book to everyone with a baby with poor sleep habits!"
1,Scary,This book scared the hell out of me. I'd rather live with crying then having my baby alone and frightened. Babies cry for a reason. They stop crying when they give up thinking anyone is coming for them. I'm glad someone put Three In a Bed by Deborah Jackson in my hand before I tried this barbarism.
1,"Don't ""Ferberize!""","This is a cruel book not based on fact. Babies yearn to be near to their parents, especially at night. To put a child alone in a cage, in the dark, and then to call this child's anxiety and tears ""sleep problems"" is inhumane in the extreme. Most societies on this earth keep babies near their parents at night, in their bed. All other mammals sleep in the same manner, too, cuddled up to their young. This is normal and what every infant craves and expects to feel safe.Read Ferber if you want to know what NOT to do with a sensitive, defenseless baby! William Sears' book, ""Nighttime Parenting"" is a much better choice for humane ways for the whole family to get a good night's sleep."
1,"Babywise in a new disguise, horrible for babies.","This author has been sited in multiple cases of failure to thrive, cases where children were starved or nearly starved to death by parents following this authors methods. Leaving an infant to cry for hours at a time, whether you are checking on them or not is neglegent and cruel. Prolonged crying produces stress hormones in a childs brain, causing permanant damage. Do your own research into good parenting, dont walk, RUN from this book and all other books written by Ferber."
2,Doesn't support my views.,"Solve your Child's Sleep Problems is a very informative read, as it provides information on anything from refusal to go to sleep to bedwetting. I must say that it does not support my parenting styles though. I believe that a baby should be sharing a room with his parents. It allows for the simplicity of anything from breastfeeding to having reasonable sleeping patterns. I also don't agree with his views of a child needing to ""accept separation from you"". I would like to ask ""for what reason?"" Is it so your children can learn to accept early on that no one will be there for him. I'm sure that Richard Ferber, M.D. is a wonderful person and probably a loving parent, but i do not accept his views. I would prefer that my children grow up to know that i will be there for them with anything they have to go through. Thank you Richard Ferber, but i do not agree with what you have to say."
1,A terrible cost to the psyche,"This book may help you sleep a little more at first, but your child will suffer for it! There are kinder, gentler ways. A better option is the No-Cry Sleep Solution: Gentle Ways to Help your Baby Sleep Through the Night by Elizabeth Pantley. Please spare your child the agony of FrankenFerber's method!"
1,Not for Breastfeeding Moms . . .,"I've read this book several times and have found some useful information in it. However, I would advise breastfeeding moms to take his suggestions with a grain of salt -- it could really compromise your breastfeeding relationship with your child.Sometimes kids really do need you in the middle of the night. Why take a chance?"
1,Ferber has changed his mind,"I hope you realize that Ferber is ""rethinking"" his advice. He now says that ""the first need of that youngster is to feel confident at night and if that means a parent with them all night then that's the way it should be, the sleep problem can be solved as a secondary issue.""You probably should avoid this book if the author himself says the method isn't good."
5,Eileen,I highly recommend Dr. Ferber's book! It describes various sleeping disorders and offers practical solutions in an easy-to-read manner.
4,Does anybody actually *read* the book?,"If you actually read the book, or even just the Amazon review above, you will see that Dr. Ferber only suggests the method for babies at least one year old. It really frightens me when I hear of people using this method with 6 month olds, or worse, 3 month olds, when they aren't ready. Dr. Ferber has gotten a bad rap by people who aren't even willing to actually read what he has to say, just dismiss him out of hand."
1,How do they do it? I couldn't,"There is no way I could let my baby cry himself to sleep. I was left to cry myself to sleep as a baby/child, and it definitely did not teach me healthy sleep habits: I have sleep apnea, wet the bed until I was 6 or 7, in a sleep study showed signs of narcolepsy as well as insomnia, and also tend to need about 10-11 hours of sleep myself. So I could never do this to my baby. He sleeps OK at six months, and I think I will let him sleep in our bed until he is at least two..."
3,Review,"Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems is a book that addresses the common problems in sleep with children. Ferber uses his educated view points to make suggestions on how to make your child sleep better. His evidence for the ideas is decent but not great. I do not agree with some of his ideas though such as a strict sleeping schedule and getting a certain amount of sleep depending on the child's age. If those techniques are used, the child is forced into a sleep instead of sleeping on their own. Ferber is also not an advocate of co-sleeping which other doctors and researchers have determined can have a enormous impact on making sure your child gets good sleep. Overall, this is an interesting book that gives a new set of ideas but some techniques should be kept away from."
1,bad advice,"In retrospect, I should never have tried the methods outlined in this book. My son cried for 4 hours straight for 3 nights, often making himself throw up in the process. He absolutely refused to lie down, so periodically fell asleep standing up holding the crib rail, and waking up when his knees buckled. Our relationship over the next few weeks suffered tremendously, and his behavior became intolerable. I read this book on my doctor's advice, and feel very strongly that it should not be recomended. I now sit or lie down with my son to send him off to sleep, often reading or online, and my presence comforts him. After reading much of the Dr. Sears parenting series, I practice many of the attachment parenting strategies for sleep and discipline, and I have found that our relationship has just kept improving. I can' help but feel guilty for taking bad advice and watching my son cry for hours. I strongly recommend that others try the Dr. Sears methods."
2,"cruel,selfish and self serving","as adults we decided to have a child...it is not an easy taskand it is a never-ending 24 hour a day job. be a grown-up and exceptresponsibility for this human being you have brought into this world. this book is cruel and a ""quick fix"". my strong willed 9 month old cried 3 hours the first night and missed his naps for two days because he cried ""the hour time limit."" the second night he cried 2 hours and barely slept longer than 20 minute intervals. he woke with swollen red eyes with dark circles. this approach does not serve in the best interest of every child (or parent). i threw it away, brought my son into bed with us and proceeded to take responsibility for the life i created by providing love whenever my child needed it, no matter if it was at 2 in the afternoon or 2 in the morning. as for our sex life...if there's a will there's always a way."
3,"Helpful, but not too helpful","Please note if you have a very stubborn child, this book may push you past all sanity. While I learned a good deal about sleep habits and sleep associations that was helpful, I ended up having to create my own method for getting my bright, sweet, incredibly stubborn year old baby to sleep. Believe me I read the book, and applied the method as stated. My little boy cried (read screamed non-stop) for 9 1/2 hours, and my going in every 10-15 minutes soothed him not at all. The next night he fell asleep (Gee, wonder why?), but the third night he was back to screaming for hours and hours. Not for us, thank you. I used the information on sleep associations, and gradually added the ones that would be helpful (dark room, same blanket, etc.), while gradually removing the ones I didn't want (rocking, singing). It took a while but my son sleeps pretty well these days, and I don't think any of us would have survived pushing through and using the outlined extinction method."
3,Schwartz is better,"Both my babies were TERRIBLE sleepers. Ferber's approach of letting them cry is a pretty good idea in that they won't learn to sleep by themselves without some crying, but if you want a more humane approach, check out Dr. Benjamin Schwartz. Same principle but more loving."
2,Much too harsh and rigid,I gave this 2 stars because it does have valid information about sleep. But all sleep books seem to agree on the basic principles. I abhor the insensitive way that solutions are arrived at. Letting a baby cry alone [..]to train him to sleep is simply wrong. Our children rely on us for comfort and security and we should accept that role. This also isn't a quick fix (my friend has been using it for about a year and her child still cries to sleep.) I much prefer the more kind and loving methods in The No Cry Sleep Solution which also covers the basics but lays out many ideas for getting sleep without the rigid let them cry ideas found here.
1,Make your baby cry,"The name given this technique by fans is Ferberizing, and it means to put your baby in her crib and let her cry herself to sleep. You go in on a schedule to reassure her and then leave her again and again until she succombs to sleep. I just could not do this to my precious baby and destroy the bond we have between us. I tried it once and she was sobbing and holding up her arms saying Mama and looking as innocent and confused and hurt as I've ever seen her. It broke my heart. Never again. I'm taking a different path and using The No-Cry Sleep Solution for gentle ways to help her sleep better. And now we both feel better."
3,Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems,"Based on research done by Richard Ferber, M.D., director of the Sleep Laboratory and Center for Pediatric Sleep Disorders at Children's Hospital in Boston, Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems attempts to do exactly what it says. This book is a practical and easy to understand guide to solving common sleep problems such as night terrors, restlessness and insomnia, bedwetting, and other ordinary medical problems. The Ferber method applies structure and stability to a child's sleep schedule and emphasizes solitary sleep over co-sleeping. If you want your child to literally ""sleep like a baby"", then this book is for you."
1,Ferber recanted in 1999,"In an article in the ""New Yorker"" magazine in 1999, Ferber recanted his views on co-sleeping and child ""independence"" (see http://users.lmi.net/sherryr/thoughts1.htm)Quote: ""I read him two sentences I had read to my wife during one of our 2 A.M. showdowns: ""Although taking your child into bed with you for a night or two may be reasonable if he is ill or very upset about something, for the most part this is not a good idea."" And, ""Sleeping alone is an important part of his learning to be able to separate from you without anxiety and to see himself as an independent individual.""""I wish I hadn't written those sentences,"" Ferber replied. ""That came out of some of the existing literature. It is a blanket statement that is just not right. There's plenty of examples of co-sleeping where it works out just fine. My feeling now is that children can sleep with or without their parents. What's really important is that the parents work out what they want to do."""""
1,Not for attachment parents -- or breastfeeding moms,"Newborn babies aren't supposed to sleep through the night. They need nourishment, because their tiny stomachs can't hold much. Ferber doesn't explain this. He's all for separating babies and moms, and giving mommy back to daddy at night. I've got news: I was allowed to cry myself to sleep at night, and I still have a sleep disorder or two (sleep apnea, insomnia, and also mild fibromyalgia). So obviously it's not a cure-all, to say the least. I also have clinical depression. Mind you, there could be other reasons, but I always remember feeling lonely and abandoned in my bed. Fine if you think your sleep is more important, but think about your child's future."
2,Consult your pediatrician first.,"If you are a parent of a baby 6 months or younger, looking for relief from nightime feedings, please consult your pediatrician first. While the Ferber method does work, it presupposes that all children 3 mo + should sleep through the night. This is patently untrue for ALL babies. Talk to your pediatrician first to understand better your baby's height/weight ratio. He or she may need the food. Last, try Sleeping Through The Night by Jodi Mindel for an easier read, that incorporates the Ferber training style, albeit more sympathetically."
1,Incredibly unimaginative & it made things worse,"I can't believe this guy is in charge of pediatric sleep disorders and the best thing he can come up with is making babies cry themselves to sleep!! I read many of the other poor reviews about this book prior to purchasing it but decided to get it anyway. My daughter is 5 months old and is intelligent, alert, and very happy. However, she has had trouble falling to sleep and staying asleep since she was 4 days old. After trying Dr. Ferber's method for a week (she did fall asleep eventually after crying) her condition hadn't improved, and in fact, got much worse. She is now afraid to be left alone not only in her crib, but in her playpen, her swing, her bouncer, etc. She doesn't trust me anymore and it will take some time to get that back. PLEASE (...) don't buy this book!!!"
2,Fine if you don't mind the crying,"Dr Ferber understands sleep. But I don't think he really understands babies. His ""program"" is scientific, but doesn't take a baby's feelings into consideration. The exact scheduling of so many minutes of crying or so many ounces of milk assumes that all babies are alike, and they aren't. My baby cried so hard he threw up, and the book says to clean him up ""matter-of-factly and then leave again"", and not to ""reward him for throwing up"" (exact words!) I'm sorry, but my baby was terribly upset and needed some reassurance. Yes, I bet the ""program"" works, but at what cost to my child's self esteem and to my relationship with my child? I found more compassionate answers in a book called The No-Cry Sleep Solution written by a mother of four who dealt with sleep issues with her own baby and clearly understands that human beings require more than a quick-fix solution."
1,This book is not for anyone with a sensitive child,"Ferberizing as they call it will not work unless your child is already relatively mellow or compliant. It was written assuming all children are the same. They aren't. I recommend ""The No Cry Sleep Solution"" instead, as something more sensitive to children's needs."
3,a warning! choking hazard!,"this is a method that works for a lot of people, and worked partially for us, too. BUT at one point our son started choking! thank god we were right there and helped him unblock his passages. what if we were not as attentive? if you decide to use ferber, MAKE sure this is a completely controlled environmet and be right outside the door any time you are letting your child cry NO MATTER the hour."
2,Sigh,"After reading all the reviews, I was ready to believe that there was another approach to the ""cry it out"" method. My problem is that my daughter, 13 months, wakes up and nurses back to sleep several times a night. Sure, I learned a little about sleep cycles, and identified that I had a problem with her sleep associations. But the advice he offered was ""some crying will be involved"". As if I hadn't tried that already?! I'm back to square one. There's no way I'll let her cry more than an hour. I've tried it. It's too hard on both of us. I didn't find Ferber too compassionate -- and, yes, I did actually read the book."
1,You don't have to let your child cry!,"If you're going to read this book, you OWE it to yourself and your child to also read Dr. William Sears' Nighttime Parenting. Dr. Sears will help you get your child to sleep without making him cry. Dr. Sears will show you how letting your child cry himself to sleep can be detrimental to both your child's and your own emotional well-being."
5,Now that I'm well-rested...,"... I can tell you that this book worked for us. Our baby was waking and crying ten times a night. Then we read the book. We endured two hours of crying the first night, 65 minutes the next, then 25 minutes, and last night - 25 seconds. Hallelujah!"
1,Didn't work for us,"We bought this book and tried it but our daughter did not respond the way the book said she would. She continued to cry well beyond what Ferber indicated, and we ended up feeling mean and stopping. It appears to work for some people, but it's not for everybody!!"
4,not for the faint of heart...,"i'll be brief. this method works. but if you are unwilling to follow the basic tenets of the program, you are doomed. you can't give in one night thinking you'll start fresh tomorrow. it doesn't work like that. if you aren't willing to follow the instructions as written for two weeks, then you probably shouldn't try this method at all. it will just be a confusing and stressful time for your family.i took less than a week to get my 7 month old daughter sleeping nine hours straight per night. and now at 9 mos. she's sleeping ll hours per night. the only reason that i don't give 5 stars is that dr. ferber doesn't spend enough time on napping. naps are a whole different ballgame for my little one. dr. ferber simply doesn't make enough of a distinction between nighttime and daytime sleeping."
2,Some good info but needs serious updating,"This book has a copy right of 1985 & a lot has changed in 20+ years in relation to SIDS & the reacceptance of breastfeeding. This book does not advocate ""attachment parenting"". There is some good information & some ""tricks"" that we've tried & have worked well, but we've just intergrated some of the Ferber method into our parenting style. I suggest just taking what works for you & your family from the book. There is no hardline on what to do when it comes to getting your child to sleep & every child will respond differently. We've had better success with Dr. Sears' books."
4,Helping our grandaughter to sleep through the nite,"I purchased this book for my daughter to help her cope with the problem of her 12 month old not sleeping through thte night. I read several chapters before I gave her the book, and found the information quite helpful. Now if my daughter follows what SHE read, they may be able to cope a lot better, and maybe even solve the ""sleeep"" problems they are having."
1,Please do not do this to any baby,"If I could give this book negative stars I would.Anyone who at any time considers it normal or acceptable for an infant to cry alone and terrified in a crib until they throw up should not be trusted to give out parenting advice. There are much better, gentler books our there that will help you soothe your children to sleep.Please do not let your babies cry out for you in the night until they give up because they realize you do not care enough to help them."
2,Nightmare,"Overall, Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems by Richard Ferber, M.D, is an interesting book. It has some good points, but at the same time, some of the ideas presented in it are very bizarre and brutal. It does address some common sleep problems found in children,and some of the techniques are helpful, but some of the solutions that it gives are barbaric. I would never do something like that to my own child especially after reading other parenting books and articles. The book addresses major issues for parents of infants, and some may believe that it is very helpful, but if you really think about the practices that it suggests, this book can become a nightmare."
3,Too complicated for sleep deprived parents,"This was one of the 4 sleep books I read and re-read from cover to cover with my daughters (who are now 4 and 17 months). Altough the techniques in this book sound good, it was just too much to do at 3am. The complete exhaustion caused by having a baby that doesn't sleep well at night makes it difficult to stick to the consistency required by this book. Going in after 1 minute, 5 mintues, etc. I found sucess with Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child by Marc Weissbluth which uses a similar technique, but without all of the repeat visits to your childs room. The M. Weissbluth book sounds more harsh on first reading, but works very quickly."
2,A word of caution for weary parents!,"Ferber's method's will not work if your child autism or SDI. This book was of no help to me five years ago, desperate with sleep deprivation as so many other parents are who turn to this book. It was very discouraging.My daughter is now six, but did not sleep through the night until she was three. She has been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, a neurological autistic spectrum disorder. Please ask your pediatrician to simply screen your child for any signs of autism if your child has chronic sleep problems that persist. Had I known about this earlier, more intervention could have been done sooner!"
3,"Easy to use, but results are lacking","I purchased this to see my levels of progesterone and estrogen. The saliva test was easy to perform. It took me less than 15 minutes to fill one container. I sent the test kit back and within 14 days had my results. The results were a bit difficult to understand and there were literally 3 sentences of explanation. I did like the fact that I have some numbers to go by, but the resulting explanation was silly. It was just a form letter not personal at all. Of course I could have paid for a more extensive explanation and I believe that is what they want you to do. I would have liked to have a few recommendations on what I could do to alter my numbers in the future.So in a nutshell, you do get results just don't expect an elaborate report. You will only get 2-3 sentences."
1,Beware this seller,"First, the lamp looks nothing like the picture. The picture shows a white shade with a subtle brass-colored lamp body, right? I got light brown shades (hayseed brown?) and a cheesy bright-yellowish brass-colored lamp.Second, the lamp was missing the filial and loop for attaching the shade.Third, no paperwork with the lamp.Fourth, try to get hold of the company that sells these, Buying Partners LLC. Go ahead, give it a try. No one answers their main phone. You get a recording about the ""high volume of calls"" they receive. For customer service, press 1. You get a lady's voice mail about being ""away from her desk at the moment.""You don't suppose this is a fly-by-night outfit, do you? I'm not so sure."
3,"Nice lamp, but you do get what you pay for...","Nice heavy base, but switch on mine was offcenter, and when you look closely it is fairly cheap construction. However, the lamps I'm comparing it too were all $150 - 200, so I'd expect the difference. Overall, not a bad value, just keep in mind this is not a super high end lamp."
5,Good purchase!,"I bought this for my husband who refuses to go to a podiatrist and has difficulty reaching to cut his toe nails with the standard size clippers. So far he's quite happy with it. The scissors works for both left and right-handed people, and cuts well. The price is right also. Can't complain at this point. A good purchase."
4,toe scissors,"Sharp, long, thin. Only fault is that the scissors may bend when squeezing arms of scissors"
2,"Daggerspell was great, but Darkspell is nowhere near as good","For all of you who have read Daggerspell, and couldn't wait to read Darkspell, I pity you. This book just didn't make me want to keep reading like Daggerspell did."
3,Boring for the first part of the book,"I liked the first book pretty well. I was curious to see how she would handle the karmic connection between the first characters and the characters they reincarnate as. Unfortunately the connection is weak (the author pretty much has to tell the reader who is who) and the characters became dull. Partway through she introduced an interesting villain and that revitalized my interest. She nearly killed him off, but was smart enough to partly redeem him. I am not planning to buy the next book, however."
5,i love that serie,I read this serie some fifteen years ago.I'm reading it again. with as much pleasure as the first time
2,Not as good as the first one.,"Something I really liked about the first book (""Daggerspell"") was how the characters weren't divided into ""heroes"" and ""villains"". There were only humans, imperfect, flawed, but trying to do the right thing, some with more success than others.Thus I was rather disappointed when I bought this book and WHAM, Nevyn was a saint and the enemy was consorting with the Lords of Darkness themselves. Where did that come from?"
4,Difficult read,"The story is great. The use of the Dark Goddess and the interactiones between the characters are beautiful. In other words, the research is excellent. But be aware that the book jump a lot between two ages and in years. Is a difficult read because is like seeing it from a god/dess perspective. Reincarnation is a big part of it."
2,Too drawn out,"After reading Daggerspell which I thoroughly enjoyed, I couldn't wait to continue with Kerr's series. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.I feel like I left this book with more questions than when I started it! Kerr seems to bring up more problems, compounding it with the problems left by Daggerspell and then never resolving any of them. It leads me to wonder how long she can drag out this series without answering or satisfying the plot's twists and turns.The writing, however, is still good as it was in Daggerspell. I will give her credit for engaging the reader's interest so that they will move on to the next book in the series. Sadly, in achieving that goal, the action and plot in this second installment suffered greatly"
1,absolute cr@p!!!!,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY....WORTHLESS GARBAGE....poor quality re-recording of home movie...no instruction of any kind....after buying guangyi's YMAA dvd i had planned to buy the series available on amazon, of which this is a part...not anymore....a complete rip-off...those responsible should be flogged in a public place and buggered with something blunt and splintery......right up there with gary alexander's 'white crane' bullsh@t...."
2,Hammond Large Type World Atlas,"I was extremely disappointed in the copy of Hammond's Large Type World Atlas from your organization. How could any legitimate seller answer a request of ""new"" Atlas by sending something published in 1981. What kind of operation is that. In terms of a useful Atlas, it is absolutely worthless. Take a look at Africa or the Balkans for instance.I have lost all faith in your ""offices"" and would certainly not recommend ordering anything from you to my acquaintances.I suspect you justify it by saying ""you didn't read the small print"".RegardsJim Crakes[...]"
4,Large Print Atlas,"Problem with first shipment never arriving, but the vendor sent second shipment with no trouble. Would not hesitate to order from them again. Used copy in good shape and large print will be much appreciated."
1,"Nice try, try again later....much much later","Although Geoff certainly has to ability to express himself through writing, I do not believe that we should have to read what he writes. I find his writing to be shallow. I acknowladge that at the age of 16 a person may still have a lot of room to grow, however I feel that Geoff has not permitted himself to do anything besides feel and express these narrow feelings. There is much more to life than love, loss, angst, and depression. Geoff has certainly put forth his greatest effort in producing this book and I certainly respect him for that. However, one may argue that the same effort may be put into a diary and kept away from the public. Regardless, Geoff needs to mature and look beyond his narrow scope of life before he writes another book. I applaud his efforts, but I pray that this will not in the future become an example of American literature."
4,A good easy listening Phil Coulter CD,"I have almost all of Phil Coulter's recordings but somehow missed (2006) Country Serenity. It is good and I will listen to it again and again (as I do almost all of his recordings) but it is not one of my very favorites. The listed songs include: If Tomorrow Never Comes, We've Got Tonight, Always On My Mind, You Raise Me Up, Amazed, Sometimes When We Touch, The Long Goodbye, From A Distance, Love Can Build a Bridge, To All The Girls I've Loved Before, In the Arms of An Angel, and Desperado. I guess what I miss is the dramatic build up with a full orchestra. Almost all of these songs are just good easy listening songs and that is it! I ordered other CD's and they were all packaged well and arrived within the promised delivery date."
1,Low quality sound,"I can't find out what quality MP3 this product is. I get an error message when I click on the MP3 link where I hoped to find what bit rate the MP3 was.It must be a low bit rate as the sound quality is poor, compared to the CD version of the album."
4,Country Serenity,"Phil Coulter is not widely known in Australia and his music is very hard to find, so consequently I went to Amazon to obtain a copy. I found Country Serenity very easy listening and would recommend it to Country Music fans."
2,Country Serenity,"I have nearly all of Phil Coulter's CD's and I love them all. I could always tell from the titles of the CD's what kind of music they would contain. With Country Serenity, however, this was not the case. There are only about 3 songs I would consider country, maybe not even that many. I wasn't looking for twangy country western stuff, because I know Coulter is very conservative and right on in his choices but most of them seemed to come from the pop genre, which I would never buy. Needless to say I was very disappointed."
5,Excelent,"This is one of my favorite recordings. Simon Preston's performance can best be described as a cross between the historical accuracy of E. Power Biggs, and the live intensity of Virgil Fox. I recommend this cd to anyone who even remotely enjoys Bach."
1,Not what you think,"The octopus volume was fine, however, it is soooo difficult to press the sensors to make it speak. It is near impossible for my 7 month old to do it. When it does speak, the voice is grating and the sayings repetitive. I thought it was a really cute product, but it turned out to be a waste of money."
1,Annoying and loud,"This toy has no volume control and it is way too loud for any baby, let alone a parent. It's annoying voice gets stuck in your head and it will drive you crazy. My four year old is relentless with it (it was given to us as a gift for my newborn, but I won't get it near him, because the sound is so loud). That said, I think it actually taught my daughter some spanish words...but still, it's not worth the pain you will go through. Why don't they install volume control on these things!!!!"
1,way too expensive for what it is..,"This toy looked like it was going to be plush, big and great value on line when i ordered it but for that money you could buy 10 other things that your baby would enjoy more. Its hard to press for the sounds so my 14 month son has not been interested in it. And now that he's older, and he can press the sounds, its not exciting enough for him. Overall this i bad design, boring, and total waste of money! I was expecting something very much more."
5,WOW....who sings like this live?,"I almost never buy live CDs because lets be honest...they usually don't sound that great compared to the CD version.But uh, let me tell you, this is absolutely amazing. This guy's voice is so incredible ""even live"" that after streaming a sample of it I had to buy it.Never in my life have I heard someone sound so fantastic live. This guy is in a league of his own in my opinion and this is now my favorite Maxwell CD."
4,The Beethoven of R&B Soul,Maxwell is one of the hottest and most profound R&B talents to ever exist in the music industry.
4,Powerful,"I have always liked Maxwell and he is rated on my list as an average artist. His music is very touching. After hearing ""THIS WOMAN'S WORKS"" I noticed just how much more powerful he was. I Love that song so much. I was a bit disappointed that it was not on the Love and Basketball soundtrack because I really wanted to here it. I later found out that it was on a 1996 previous CD and when I went to look for it, it was sold out everywhere because everybody was feeling this song. So that why I had to order it off the Net. I guess it's not so bad that it's not on the soundtrack, because that way Maxwell gets the full credit. Maxwell is really elevating and I think he deserves it."
4,Wonderful LIve recording,"I love Maxwell and to get to hear him interact with the live audience was a treat. The songs are awesome, the ones I had heard fast were slowed down and the slow ones sped up , no matter the tempo the music is awesome. I read a review about this cd and the guy said it was a must-have and i have to agree 100%. I love Maxwell and all his music."
2,Mcbain is fed up with the 87th precinct.,"I was looking forward to Mcbain's latest. But what I thought could never happen, happened. Mcbain disappointed me.Where were the witty dialogues of former days? Why is Steve Carella all of a sudden aging and slowly becoming obsessed with his age? Is Carella becoming so careless that he never noticed that he was being followed? Where was Bert Kling and his new love? Formerly a new 87th precinct novel would keep me spellbound, but now I found myself wondering when this boring story would end.Why did Mcbain write such a boring novel? Does he want out after almost fifty 87th precinct novels? Perhaps the answer is ""yes"". However,I really hope that Mr Mcbain will delight us with many more of his fine novels. I'm convinced that the next novel will be in the true Mcbain and 87th precinct tradition.Looking at his past track record I am convinced that the next 87th precinct novel will not be a disappointment."
3,Not one of his best but still enjoyable,"As a big fan of the 87th Precinct Series, I was a little disappointed in Ed Mcbain's latest contribution to the series. The two main stories, a murdered nun and a burglar who leaves cookies behind at the scene of the crime are good police procedural tales but feel a little hollow. There are no neat twists which McBain usually throws in, no diagrams or pictures and no irony. While I wasnt bored, I was able to put The Big Bad City downbefore I went to sleep."
2,Very disappointing,"This is a poorly made shaver from a company that once was stellar. The head hinge is weak and the head tends to pop off unexpectedly, a problem made worse by the poorly designed blade holder which also comes out when you look at it funny. It shaved well until replacement blades went in; after that point, despite getting authentic Norelco replacements designed for the shaver - twice - it has done poorly.Batteries are of course the cheapest NiCads Norelco could buy, not user replaceable.The cheapest three-head Norelco is better made than this rather pricey model."
5,Excellent Alternative To Fatty Potato Chips For Snacks,"We use these as handy snacks, also crush them and blend into breakfast muffins baked from a basic recipe. Excellent product, as all of Bob's Red Mill products have proven to be for us. The flavor is subtle, lightly sweet, and these are filling without being fattening."
2,Cheap,"I had started taking a multivitamin awhile back and felt great. I was getting better sleep, feeling great, was no longer having issues with chapped lips (B2 deficiency,) etc. Then I got these instead of the ones I had been taking because they are less expensive, and within a week my lips chapped again and I started having problems sleeping again. With as high a dose of vitamins this claims to have this should not be happening, I don't think they are being absorbed properly.Also my urine no longer has a slight florescent color, which it should have with that high a dose of B2, since it is meant to provide as much as your body could possibly need and more."
4,does the job,"I didn't really feel different when started taking them, I dunno if I was supposed to. Pretty much the same thing as any other multivitamins. I would buy again. If I feel different when I stop taking them, I will update my review."
2,Would not recommend,This product I have been taking for a month and I have notice any difference.This formula/multi vitamin wasn't a good quality as claimed
2,Posssibly good but I have huge alergy reaction on it.,i am not highly allergic individual but these vitamins covered all my face with pimples. the same time bends of my elbows started to be itchy. Also never eat them with out food - the possibility to to talk to big white phone is too high ))) So I stopped and switched to liquid vitamins. Now I have no reaction so far.
5,Great Multi,"This is an excellent product. The price is very fair and it works great. It is loaded with things you need. Although its kinda annoying taking two a day at different times, that is what your body needs when you are lifting or an athlete like this product is intended for. I wouldn't recommend this to a normal person, but anyone who is lifting/working out or is an athlete this is a great product that will help you achieve your goals. It has vitamins and minerals and is always pumping great stuff into your body since you take it twice a day. Totally worth it. Best vitamin I have ever been on in my life."
1,I lost my soles,"I was looking for a nice pair of shoes that would also be comfortable to walk around in. During my second time wearing them the sole of one of the shoes came completely off while I was in the mall. The other sole was coming loose as well. I was disappointed in the quality, especially for the price."
2,Cute shoes but uncomfortable,"Very well made, cute, but not much room in toe area. Toes felt almost crushed and ended up returning the shoes."
4,Wonderful overview,Arber offers a great summary of the varied herbals littering the early modern period and prior. One of the few academic works available on this subject.
3,Not Impressed,"The unit operates as advertised. The CD and tape players work fine, and the radio receives well. However - the product sounds tinny, even with the subwoofer set to the maximum level. Seems like JVC was more concerned with how it looked than with how it sounded."
3,Its okay,"I wanted the first one, but this is better. I've broken my review into five parts.1. Pictures - sloppy, out of proportion, looks like a small child got them off the internet and used Word to make them bigger but still fit the page. -1*2. Text - looks as though typed with an unresponsive space bar and over-active period key, the mistakes are really pathetic. -1*3. Content - interesting trivia, nice overview of every episode. Plus guest stars, salaries, and bat-gadgets. +1*4. Enjoyment - I was expecting a more kid oriented book, more trivia and less episodes, but you can't blame the book. +1*?5. Overall - It isn't what I was expecting, but is full of good referenceand okay pictures. +1** = star"
4,No personal stake involved in my Batbook purchase,"I'm totally unbiased in my review. Yes, this volume is not as ""slick"" as the first edition as it doesn't have any colored pictures and perhaps some of the pictures may appear to have some distortion due to the layout,but I would certainly recommend this book. I had two copies of the previous edition that fell apart; this new volume appears sturdier.Besides material from the first edition, there are numerous new pictures, many of them not previously published in a trade paperback format. In addition, there is new information that will appeal to even the most hard-core fan. I especially liked the Dozier / Guest Villain communiques.In short, if you are a Batfan, forget the controversy and buy this volume."
5,Sublime readings of Brahms's neglected string quintets,"This is a new, 1996 digital recording from the Juilliard Qt., which if I am not mistaken replaces an older analog recording from the Sixties. It's confusing, because I can't find that older version on CD, and to intensify my muddle, Walter Trampler was also the extra violist back then (I think). Anyway, the older musicians of the Juilliard no longer hit every note perfeclty in tune, and the digital sonics can be a bit edgy. For all that, these are great performances, a combinaiton of heart, style, and decades of experience.Both of Brahms's string quintets are among his most appealing chamber pieces, unrelieved in their sunniness. It's a shame they aren't better known. Aside form this CD, there's one of Quintet #2 that gathers together a starry cast (Isaac Stern, Jaime Laredo, Michael Tree, Cho-Liang Lin, Yo-Yo Ma) to honor Stern's career in chamber music--it's on Sony, too, and is the only reading I've ever heard that surpasses this one."
3,Aging Juilliards still worth a listen.,"As so often, the conflicting opinions of this recording all have some validity. Yes, the Juilliards are still a great quartet and these are strong perfomances. Yes, the recorded sound is a tad harsh. Yes, there is a lot of vibrato in evidence - specifically, too slow and wide a vibrato, especially from the first violin; I don't hear this on older Juilliard recordings and I'm inclined to attribute it to old age (the same thing happens with aging singers, and aging everybody: muscles, whether in hand or throat, become stiffer and more sluggish). These factors militate against an ideal blend, against the mellowness I like to hear in these beautiful works, and they make this recording a slightly uncomfortable listen for me. But the performances exhibit the Juillard's usual energy, passion and intelligence,and those not bothered by what I find to be defects will probably be satisfied."
5,A fantastic recording,"The first review of this CD here describing it as ""vulgar and out-of-tune"" is ridiculous. This is a very polished, well-performed and well-recorded CD of the Brahms string quintets. The Juilliard String Quartet and Walter Trampler do a wonderful job on this album, in spite of what some yahoo may say."
3,Still disappointed,"I've given this CD a 3-week trial and am still disappointed. The performance is technically accomplished and the tempos wisely chosen. But the Juilliard's use of vibrato is distracting and, coupled with the recording's rather thin sound, never allows me to relax and get into the music."
2,"Completely out of tune, vulgar performance",This poorly executed reading should be skipped. The sound is extremely harsh and the playing is totally out of tune.
4,Warning: Lots of gluten and yeast,"This is an excellent vegetarian cookbook. It includes great recipes for dairy substitutes, beef substitute, chicken substitute, etc.However, many of the recipes (especially the substitutes) call for gluten and/or yeast -- two ingredients that we cannot have due to health issues.Just wanted to let that be known to others who cannot use those ingredients.Still, lots of great vegan recipes.Edited to add: For those to whom it might matter, this monastery is not in communion with the Orthodox Church. It is a ""Gnostic Orthodox"" monastery."
1,meh. should be titled a meat-lovers vegetarian cookbook ;p,"This should be titled a meat-lovers vegetarian cookbook. I'm not a vegetarian who craves meat though - I have not felt the need to make fake meat. But, if that is what you're looking for - this really would be a good cookbook for you. 75% of the recipes call for fake meat, and they go to great lengths to make it taste like meat. Additionally, they go to great lengths to make fake cheese. Sigh. Disappointed..."
2,An Outdated Piece of .com Junk,"While this book is extremely well written, it is outdated now in 2003. This book is filled with the hype, euphoria, and speculative promises of the .com era. Yes, the writing sizzzles and many of the stories are interesting, but the writing seems to lack a firm foundation of fundemental research and the stories when read carefully seem to be re-written from third party accounts rather than the result of original research, interviews, and fact finding. Somehow, Wired Magazine articles are better than this."
2,Doing Floyd an injustice - their own fault probably,"These works cannot be taken out of context. It is that simple. Certainly, they are pleasant to listen to, but their true impact can only be experienced within the context of the respective albums. 2 stars because the music is great, of course. And, of course, a slap on the wrist to Pink Floyd, who allowed this money-grabbing scheme to be loosed on the public. Shame on you, you know better, and you don't need it."
2,Not worth full Price,"I didnt expect much with this CD and I dont get much when i listen to it. I have just about all the US releases of pink floyd including Piper at the Gates of Dawn and Dark side of the Moon. its just a contract album really. just something pink floyd threw out to tide people over until they could release ""the final cut"". It IS pink floyd but they're not a single's band and this cd tries to make them something they're not. only buy it if its under 5 dollars! Thanks for reading"
2,Incomplete,"This is a pretty poor greatest hits collections. A band who has made 13 albums (as Pink Floyd did before the release of this album) can not be summed up in 6 songs (from 5 albums.) Not only is the album short, but they felt the need to shorten the songs with radio edits of Shine On You Crazy Diamond Part 1-5 and Another Brick in the Wall Part 2 - which are not different enough from the originals to interest even the most dedicated of Floyd fan. The only reason I am giving it any stars is because it contains 6 of the amazing songs - but not the best 6 in Floyd history and - even it they were - it would not be enough. Get Dark Side of the Moon or Wish You Were Here first."
2,: The Worst of Pink Floyd,"Poor selection from great albums. Totally ill-advised project. Where's 'Pigs on the Wing'? How about 'Comfortably Numb'? 'In the Flesh'? 'Hey You'? 'Run Like Hell'? 'Have a Cigar'? Granted, 'WYWH' is a great exception, but they didn't include the best stuff! Better to buy the complete original CDs. Or was that their original intent?!"
2,Not much point,"I never really have understood why this album was released. I used to have it on vinyl; God knows where it is now. Anyway, I know it has the re-recorded version of ""Money,"" and the single version of ""Another Brick..."" and a cool cover, but for the life of me I can't figure out why I should care. The truth is there's very little here to get all worked up about, even if you're a Floyd fanatic."
1,"Now that 'Echoes' is out, this CD is obsolete","I'll keep it short (this CD sure is). Most of the songs here are from 4 mid-70s Pink Floyd records (Wish You Were Here/Animals/DSOTM/The Wall), making it useless as a rounded look at a constantly changing band. Now that the 'Echoes' best-of is available, all of the songs on this CD can be found there, with an hour-and-a-half of more music. This CD is now obsolete, and should probably be deleted from the Pink Floyd catalog."
2,"good songs, bad album","i never took the title to this cd seriously, i really thought it was a joke. if it was meant to be an album to dance to, then they failed miserably. ""one of these days"" is a great PF song, but then it goes into ""money"", these 2 songs do not sound good together. ""Sheep"" is another good song and then the always good ""Shine on you crazy Diamond."" but again they screwed up ""another brick in the wall"" just doesn't fit there. the songs are good, but the album sucks, so i recommend you buy the original albums and listen to these songs in the form that they were truly meant to be heard."
4,Non-essential Collection,"Notable only for a weak remake of Money, and a version of Shine On that blends parts 1-4 (up through the lyrics) with the 3rd verse from part 7 and fades out with part 5, minus the sax solo.For Floyd completists only. Everyone else, get the albums these tracks came from: Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall."
4,Worth the money,"This album contains many classic songs, all from the most popular albums; ""Dark Side of The Moon"", ""The Wall"", ""Meddle"", ""Wish You Where Here"", and ""Animals"". While all of these songs are excellent, they are out of context. All of these albums flow seamlessly together, and fit perfectly. They do a good job of fitting the songs together on ""Dance Songs"", they don't have the feel of the original album.I give these albums 4 stars because it is a compilation album, and takes the songs out of context. Even so, the songs themselves make it a great album."
1,Buy a different cookbook!!!,"This is the worst cookbook I have even purchased. I am a vegetarian and I own a lot of cookbooks.Most of the recipes have ingrediants like vegetarian prawns, vegetarian scallops, etc... I have lived in various parts of the US and Europe and I have never even seen some of these ingrediants. The author lists no respources on how to obtain these ingediants. So, basically most of the recipes are totally useless.Buy a different vegan cookbook"
3,Don't do it,"This is a good item, but you will be better off getting two full superyards. All this product is is two pannels. If you just pay 49.50 instead and you will get six panels. I am going to send mine back to get another full superyard. They fold up and will fit in a small area when not being used. This should be a five star product but it is not the best deal, so sorry but three stars is the best I can do."
3,Wish it had a gate,"Maybe it's just because I'm short, but getting in and out of this thing to pick up or play with the kid is a pain, literarlly. I keep hitting my foot against the gate when I step in it. I wish it had a gate. But other than that it's nice to section off a part of the house that is safe for baby. My son also likes to pull up to standing and walk along the gate by using the holes for his hands."
3,broke 2 pieces,"some bent out of shape.dont make a big area with these.. but for 4-5 pieces they are useful.not super easy to put on and take off but not too bad either.i used it for my baby for a long time. be gentle and dont force trying to set it up, or you will break them."
5,Great Product,"I ordered this to increase the inside pen for my dachsies. I've also reordered 2 full pens for traveling. Secure, durable, washable, indoor/outdoor, shape modifiable, great buy for the price."
4,Hard to adjust angles on panels!,"I have to say this extension is wonderful but, like the primary panels, it is moderately difficult to adjust the angles of the panels with it's stiff hinges. Like many trade-offs with Design vs Convenience, it suffers greatly on the convenience side while providing rigidity and sturdiness on the design side.It is fairly sturdy and my 16 month old can still shift it around somewhat on the hardwood floors if he really tries to put his weight into it, and that's even with the rubber feet installed, and those you MUST install if you are using this on hardwood floors to help prevent it from sliding all around. Haven't used it on carpets, but I'm betting that might still be an issue if you don't have the rubber feet installed for extra grip.LIFESAVER for keeping the little ones safe, occupied and giving them lots more room to play while you are busy cooking, cleaning and doing other chores!"
4,Our second one,"Very good product. One at my daughter's home, one at my office for two babies that come to work with their Mom. Easy to take up and down, not too heavy, folds neatly away in a corner. Good quality material."
5,The Superyard XT Play Gate Extention is Great!,"I purchased the extention kit for the Superyard XT Play Gate to go with the Play Gate that I purchased. It works great for my new Pomeranian Puppies. The Play Yard is wonderful for keeping the puppies all in one place and knowing that they are safe. It will also be nice to pick up and take outside as the weather improves. The fact that is is portable makes it nice to pick up and take it as we travel so I can still provide a safe place for them where ever we happen to be. I love this item and I am very happy I purchased it. I feel the gate is great for animals, I have not used it with Children as of this time."
3,Better to buy two of the Superyards,"The Superyard is great. Works perfect.The three stars is about this as an extension.Superyard (3 folding panels) $60Superyard extension (1 folding panel) $30If you need more or want better flexibility for where you have one set up, its better to buy two of the full Superyards than one Superyard and one extension."
5,Pen,"I have a dog that likes to take off, but this pet yard exercise pen keeps him nearby and it's easy to move from one spot to another."
5,Great for dogs,My wife and I got this for our new puppies inside the house. It works great both inside and out.
4,Superyard extension kit,The package arrived earlier than expected and fit perfectly with my existing panels. Now my triplets have more room to roam without causing too much trouble!
4,good gate,"This is a pretty good gate. Helpful that it came all connected already. We use it in a U-shape with the couch sealing off the ""U"". We do need to put stuff on the other side for support as my baby can push the gate and stand up holding onto the gate and shake it. He can push the gate open but at least it keeps him away from the TV and fireplace."
3,Worth reading.,"If you're into dinosaur films then this book will be well worth getting hold of, as it contains information on movies starring the giant reptiles from the beginning of movie-making up to and including 'Jurassic Park'. The only problem is its horribly critical style of writing. A book which can rubbish 'Jurassic Park' and virtually every Harryhausen film and yet heap praise on trash like 'Carnosaur' is just laughable."
4,A good survey,An excellent scholarly discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of N. T. Wright's provocative work. There is no obvious evidence of bias in the selection of scholars. Most papers included in the book are written by scholars of international repute. There is both trenchant criticism and well argued support. It is a useful way of gaining an overview of the reception of Wright's work amongst New Testament scholars and seeing quickly where (and why) his work is controversial.
5,Great overview of an interesting view of Jesus,"This book is a perfect introduction to N.T. Wright's view of Jesus. It's essays are written by some of the brightest scholars and respresent a variety of takes on Wright's work.On the whole this work relects positively on Wright. Evenso, Borg's response is not dismissed but rather given the penultimate position in the book."
3,Historical Shmorical,I can't understand why everyone loves historical novels and this one is crazy. Talking about people you never heard of. Johnson who? I mean it's like watching black and white television. it doesn't say anything about now. And isn't now where we're living. The work shows no creativity in it's approach to medicine or the state of literature in general. It will never win the BOOKER!
3,Minor Bainbridge,Not one of the late author's better works. Try Dressmaker or Sweet William which are much better.
5,One of her best!!,"I've been a fan of Beryl Bainbridge for years and this rendition of the life of Samuel Johnson is right up there with Watson's Apology. It's still a mystery to me how she mixes the horror and humor of life so well. Certainly, the darkness of tone running through all her books is not for everyone. Although this novel retains her oblique storytelling style, it is easier to figure out what exactly is going on than in some of her previous novels. She captures perfectly the muck and disarray of 18th-century living and of Johnson's life."
3,A Classic in 'New Age' Literature,"Spangler was the youngest of the small crew who founded Findhorn. He was planning on a life in the hard sciences when, as young boy, he made contact with and became a part of an entity he could only call ""Limitless Love and Truth""...and thus began an amazing journey which took him from the US, to Scotland for the founding of Findhorn, around the world as a lecturer and ""organizer of change"", and then back to the US where he now resides. In this book he describes the extraordinary cosmological and personal insights which were revealed to him through the channel that was created, and through the life experiences that ensued. He sets this all against the backdrop of the emergence of a new humanity, a reborn earth, and the potential for fundramental transformation which lurks just beneath thhe surface of our time."
5,"""Must"" reading for all Clive Barker fans.","The Essential Clive Barker (019529-0) will prove important to any who are avid followers of his various horror and supernatural scenes and writings. For over twenty years Barker has created distinguished and vivid horror scenes: this provides a range of his writings, from early works to recent literary novels. Excerpts from plays and short stories are included within thirteen themes which examine his works."
1,don't buy this book,"i love clive barker, but he should stick to writing books and not just pick through his old books and put bits and pieces of them all in a book just to make a dime. if you want to read some of barkers works read the actual books! i am sorry to inform the other four dimwits who reviewed it but this book is not good at all. i had to force myself to read it it was so dull. and if you are wondering why i bought it, i didn't i recieved it as a gift and that is the only excuse i can think of for owning this book."
5,An incredible book!,"Learning to Hear The Whispers of God contains many personal stories from the author's family life. These are stories that are very easy for me to relate to because they are common situations for a family with children. This makes it a comfortable book to read. It is also easy to make a connection with the truths about God, and how He talks to His children, that Donna is sharing in her book."
5,"A Rare Opportunity, but Truly an Excellent Performance!","I consider it a very special double-decker, because this is the only time Lenny has recorded with the Berlin Phil, while Karajan was around, and they have been hostile, musically, to each other. Karajan is truly very fine on his recording with the Berlin Phil on Mahler's ninth, but Lenny's recording with the same orchestra is truly the best. His recording appears to be little bit more stern, accurate, and expressive. He recorded the music almost like a perfectionist without any defiance of changing the exact score on the music, unlike what he had done on Tchaikovsky's sixth on DG.Overall, it is a rare opportunity for the great Jewish-American Leonard Bernstein to conduct Germany's great Berlin Philharmonic while the Germanic Herbert von Karajan was around, but Lenny's performance on Mahler's ninth with the Berlin Phil is truly a masterpiece! It's my favorite Mahler CD I have, besides his recording on the second symphony on DG."
5,"A new ""Hunter fan""",I recommend spending a few extra dollars and getting something that you will still like in 5 years. I am sure that this unit will fit into that category.
3,The condensed version,"I didn't realize that this was a condensed version of this book. I always love to read JD Robb, but I was not happy with this book being condensed. If you r looking for a shortened ""in death"", then u will enjoy this. I would like for future purchases to know when they r condensed stories."
4,short story,"Bought this J. D. Robb book for wife. She was disappointed in it's length, it's not a novel but a novelette. Upon reading it, however, she found it enjoyable. For someone that doesn't like reading 400 page books, this is just fine."
1,a reprint. a cheat. a disappointment,"This title was originally printed in the Silent Night anthology and is NOT NOT NOT new material from the author. If you own all the In Death books (like me) or have read all the In Death books, then realize that you've read this before.If you have these books or have read these books before, it's just a publishing trick to separate you from your money. If you are new to the series, start with the first book."
2,An Indeath Disappointment,"I am an avid fan of this series and extremely disappointed in this latest re-release. Unlike the reviewer, ""Deb"" I knew exactly what I was doing when I purchased this novella from 1998 and have read the entire series. Disappointed in the writing is an understatement. This book has editing, as well as continuity errors. The story was short, jagged and nothing near the work that I am accustomed to when it comes to this series (i.e., Divided in Death, Conspiracy in Death, Vengeance in Death). I will chalk my disappointment up to the fact that Nora had to condense all the information because of the length of the book. The two stars are for Nora because I know what a great talent she really is and the excellence of this series and characters she has created."
5,Nora Roberts Re-Release,"Note that all new Nora Roberts books that are in print for the first time have a logo with NR either for New Release or Nora Roberts, I'm not sure, but it helps to find the new books if you are a long-time reader."
4,Midnight in death,"I'm addicted to her ""Death Series"" and this one hasn't let me down. How does she come up with different scenarios to keep us entertain beats me"
5,Dallas & Roarke....great together,"If you love intrigue and romance, this is the book for you. Dallas always goes above and beyond for the victims adnd Roarke always has her back."
5,Electrifying,"This story is dripping with suspense! Eve is a tough cop after a killer who is a genius madman. The book is short, but that is a plus because it is so action packed, you will not put it down until the end.Marty WurtzAuthor of Deceptions and Betrayals"
1,What a rip off,"I guess I wasn't paying attention. I have been looking forward to a NEW Eve Dallas installment and didn't realize that Midnight in Death was just a rerelease. For several weeks now I have been hoping that Midnight in Death would turn out to be the story of Eve and Roake's first Thanksgiving with family. I had my book at 8:15 this morning looking forward to a nice read. In the first paragraph I realized my mistake.Now I just have one question. Ms Roberts, you are one of the most prolific authors of this generation. Don't you have enough money already? Sure, the 3 dollars I paid for a novella I already own won't break me. My kid still has shoes and there is gruel on the table. What I don't have is a nice day spent in 2059 chasing murders. Oh well.Hope my 3 dollars helps.Deb"
1,I feel ripped off,I ordered this book without looking at the number of pages. I assumed for $5 it was a full length book. It is not. It is 90 pages and it says boldly on the cover $2.99 great deal! I paid $4.98 so that isnt a great deal at all. Save your money and buy another book.
1,overcharged,The book is only 90 pages. The price marked right on the book is $2.99 yet Amazon charges $4.99. Absolutely not worth the money.
1,Disappointed,I was disappointed with this book. It was much thinner than all the other J.D.Robb books. However having said that Amazon not only allowed me to keep the book but refunded my money. AMAZING
1,poorly written,"This is the first time I've read a mystery by this writer. Maybe I've just outgrown Nora Roberts, but I could'nt make it thru this one. Thank goodness the price was low. The book seems to have the necessary elements, but put together in a casual ""phoned in"" way."
3,Midnight in Death,"The story, in itself, is as expected by such a well accomplished Author. I missed it when it came out in hard cover, but what I did not expect were the Americanisms in this version. Nora Roberts should be complaining to Amazon about words misspelled causing ridiculous mis-meanings. CANVAS, instead of CANVASS; A tarpaulin instead of a neighbourhood search. Alas this is not uncommon throughout Kindle e-books. Possibly these errors could be caused by the programme, not the lack of proof reading competency."
5,small treasure,"Somehow Nora Roberts, AKA J.D. RObb, has managed to pack all of the best elements of her full lenth books into this short read. Roarke and Eve learn to respect the traditions of a holiday that was not a part of their childhood. (Christmas) while Eve tries to solve a series of murders that targets both her and Dr. Mira as the next victims."
4,"A Good Short Read, Midnight in Death","I am an avid Nora Roberts fan, and have recently started reading the J. D. Robb series. I wasn't disappointed. It's actually a short story edition, so it doesn't give as much depth to the development of the story, but I still enjoyed it because I had other longer reads before and since then. My only disappointment is that with the Kindle versions of the J. D. Robb books I've read, the spelling mistakes are too many. Corner is never spelt right and neither is Morris and other irritating mistakes. I hope they can be re-edited and corrected."
5,Love it,"Awesome futuristic series. Nora Roberts, aka J D Robb, is a very talented writer and I hope that one day she will consider bringing this series to the big screen."
1,Prosaic & jejune Rock/Pop + horrible singing voice,"The singer of Little Birdy has the sort of voice that makes you want to put poison in the bird seed.I have heard Little Birdy a number of times now and I am not sure which is worse - Little Birdy, Kasey Chambers, Missy Higgins, Aqua, Killing Heidi or Delta Goodrem? All the singers here **** me off. How bad can a human singing voice be?Have people forgotten what a beautiful and stylish singing voice sounds like?"
1,Don't believe the hype,This is the worse album I have ever heard in my short life (21 years).This man is just a wanna be Bob Marley. His lyrics express nothing execept monotomous Bullsh*t.Save yourself some money:DO NOT BUY IT!!
5,SUBLIME!,"Let me just say this is the most sound musical investment I have ever made. An absolutely sublime debut, a completely solid album. I honestly don't think it does the album justice to pick out just a few tracks for special mention. Just listen, without shuffling or skipping, and enjoy the musical journey with your tour guide, Finley Quaye."
5,Hyper!,The finest blend of old-school reggae vibe with sounds and structures from the future. One of my all time favorites.
3,Nice thing... but nothing more,"I like this album, I mean, really... but I like the sound, not the music. The songs are just mediocre, there is only a decent one (It's great when we're together) and listening to the acoustic demos for this album made me think that Finley Quaye makes records only because he's Tricky's uncle, Caleb Quaye's nephew and son of Osibisa percussionist. The product is good, but thanks to the staff around Finley, not certainly thanks to Finlay himself, which proves to be a good singer but without emotions..."
4,BEST BUY for PSP,Works great. the sound is good anve I like the way it slides to open for the PSP. Great purchase for the PSP lover
4,A jump start indeed,"Being Catholic Today is what we use during our Mystagogia sessions in the RCIA (Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults). It's format is simply followed for our new Catholics to continue to appreciate what formation they've begun in the process and challenges them with practical ways to live their faith beyond the process. Reflection and Discussion Questions, Action Ideas, and Read Me! sections are very helpful to the catechists facilitating the gatherings."
1,There WAS a TV series on A&E about this story,"Too much hype here for a POD book! This story is available in MANY places and there was a TV series on A&E a few years ago called 'City of Angels' built around a reporter - Wayne Rogers - and there were three episodes called 'The November Plot' in 1976 with Lloyd Nolan playing Smedley Butler. Check out imbd = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0542116/ Pretty good show and I have seen it several times. So no one is hiding anything, except perhaps a little bit of truth concerning the availability of this story. It is a good story and it is worth knowing, but please, no conspiracy stories about vanishing books. This book is not the only book to have covered the story which even appeared in American Heritage magazine."
5,Michael Bolton never disappoints,"This is yet another in a wonderful series of music by Michael Bolton. This music is as wonderful to hear as it is to feel. The earthy, smoky quality of his voice penetrates right through you. I am a long time fan, and hope a new CD will be coming soon! I am never disappointed by the quality and emotion of this music."
3,Great...If You Like Him,"I can recognize that Michael Bolton does what he does very well. He just doesn't appeal to me personally. I like love songs but generally prefer and older style such as from Sinatra or Bennet. More than that, though, his voice is not as smooth to me as many others. That does not stop this from being a good album for those who like him, though.The mixes are strong and he is definitely able to belt out the songs. I think that even the songs would appeal to many; I liked many of them but didn't like the performance.Fans should be please. I was underwhelmed."
5,Michael Bolton you are the best !!!,"This CD is one of his best. This guy pored his soul into another classic. I love Michael bolton just as much as Luther Vandross (check out my review for him too) Though he is different genre from Luther. Michael is in a class all by himself. The song ""Best of Love"" gave me the confidence to go after and win back the Love of my life. This whole CD is a must have!!!"
3,"Great CD, but not like his first stuff","This CD is reminiscent of other singers careers and the nature of music. Mr. Bolton, with this album, has put out a great collection of new songs. Although I applaud him for excellence in writing, his voice just isn't the same. It's like listening to Neil Diamond, although always great, now he just isn't the same as when he came out with the hits ""Sweet Caroline"" and ""I Am... I Said."" Like Neil, Mr. Bolton has lost some of his old voice that made the songs like ""How Am I Supposed to Live Without You"" stand out from all of the other songs of the time. A great effort, but if you want classic Bolton, check out one of his earlier albums."
2,Just Michael's picture on the CD is worth it!,"The synthetic and electronic background music clashes with Michael's natural, earthy, and sexy voice that we all love. My comment about this CD is: ""All That Matters"" doesn't matter. This CD may not appeal to anyone over 25."
5,The best from Michael,"This is the best music I have ever heard. Mr. Bolton`s voice is marvellous and sexy. Good songs,wonderful voice,great music! I heard Michael singing six years ago and I just can`t stop loving and listening to Him. If I went to an unknown island,I would bring a CD from Michael Bolton! MICHAEL FOREVER"
5,my dog's favortie,These rings can be a little messy because of the cardboard but they are my dog's favorite thing to chew. You can leave him for hours and it also helps with puppy breath. I would definately recommend this item.
1,Reads like a company-sponsored manual,"I bought this book for work, hoping that my department would find it useful to lend to new grads. After reading it, I determined that there is nothing here a new grad couldn't get more authoritatively from a TI manual or his own textbooks. I am out the cost of the book, because I am not going to submit it for reimbursement. By the way, I bought this book on the force of a review in one of those e-mail e-magazines for engineers. I have thus lost all faith in that process."
1,"This book puts the ""AWE"" in AWFUL!","After reviewing the contents of this book, I found that it is very much misnamed. HTML 4.0 Sourcebook should definitely not be called a ""sourcebook"" because it is lacking in any valuable ""sources."" Having purchased it as a reference guide, I found that it touched on the needs of a Web developer, at best, on a limited basis. Other features lacking in this book: There is no quick reference section (as is often found in most HTML books), it is lacking in any substantial structure, and the layout is lacking in any type of usability. The book reads as if written by a professor desperately needing to get published. I recommend ANY other HTML book over this one."
2,HTML 4.0 Fundamentals Review - Feb 2010,"This book makes a good bible, in that it has all the features of HTML, but it is NOT a book to use to learn from.Not enough good examples nor summary tables of the HTML tags."
5,Great machine,The only down side to this vacuum is the small dust canister but unless you haven't cleaned your place in months it's more than sufficient and it empties easily and quickly.Three speed suction control makes it very versatile
2,Yuck!,"I will never get another bagless vacuum. I have to vacuum daily because of a dog that sheds 24/7. This was not a good vacuum for such a thing. It has good power & is easy to use, but to have to empty the very small dust bin, and clean the filter was a nasty job. Dog hair got all wrapped around the filter, and dust and dirt got trapped inside it. I had to bring it outdoors to bang it off, yuck. I do not reccomend this vacuum to anyone who has to vac more than once a week."
4,"Good Vacuum, but plastic like everything else today","I have had this vacuum for just over a year. The idea is good. The motor and suction are good. The design is good. HOWEVER, it is on it's way to falling apart. Gee, they just don't make plastic like they used to."
2,Powerful - but falls apart.,"I have never used a vacuum that cleans carpets so well and breaks so fast. After two years it is garbage. It is heavy to use. It does not work well on tiles. It just falls apart and leaves red and black rubber marks everywhere. I have read a lot of reviews now in need of something new, and I see that I am not the only one having problems with Hoover and durability. Even if it sucks well - it just is not worth it."
3,"If you are used to an upright, don't buy this canister","I have hardwood floors and a few area rugs, so a friend advised me to buy a canister vacuum. I have had a bagless before and like being able to rid my home of the pet hair so I wanted that function. It did assemble easily and works well, but I dislike it more and more each time I use it. You have to drag the machine around as you work, and it gets hung up on furniture. I have a small home, less than 2000 square feet, but I must empty the collection bin at least three times per vacuum, if you go by the line indicated on the machine. I thought the cord would pull out as I went along, but there is too much tension so it pulls from the wall. You must work around 22 feet of cord on the floor as you vacuum. All in all, I am sorry that I changed from what I was used to. I am also sorry I purchased online, even though the cost was less. A local store would have taken a return with no penalty... Amazon will not give you a full refund so be cautious."
5,"Tried the rest, got the best.","I bought this vacuum after reading all the great reviews, and I just got my order in today, put it together (no screwdriver needed, thank you very much) and tried it out. I was amazed at how well this vacuum worked. It made my old carpet look new again! This vacuum has such power and it's lightweight and quiet, compared to the many vacuums I have gone through over the years, this one is surely a keeper. Most people complained, however, about emptying the container after each use, but I would rather not have all that crud it picks up just lying in the canister. I don't mind cleaning it after vacuuming four bedrooms, a hallway, and stairs. I most definately reccomend this vacuum."
5,Great Vacuum,"I have been using an upright for quite a few years and hated it. We heat with wood stoves so I get a lot of wood chips on the floors as well as a lot of dust. Since I have arthritic knees and had trouble pushing the upright I decided it was time to go with a cannister vacuum. After doing some research on this one, I ordered it and vacuum at least 3x a week now. I can't believe how much it picks up every time I vacuum. I am now buying a second one for my daughter for Christmas."
1,Very Disappointed!,"I had also read all the great reviews which is why I purchased it. It has caused me nothing but aggravation and now I'm tossing it after just 1 year. Huge waste of money! It overheats a lot and has now completely stopped working. When it worked, I still didn't like it. Yes, the suction was good, but otherwise I found it cumbersome, heavy, difficult to change attachments, and I had to empty the dirt collection container constantly. It was a mess! Also, mine wouldn't vacuum up anything hard. Even just a piece of string would jam the roller. Maybe I just had a lemon - but I don't have anything good to say about it![Note: I've never written a review about anything, but I had such harsh feelings about this that I felt compelled. I also feel bad about writing a bad review, but perhaps I can save someone some money and aggravation. Besides, I don't think Hoover will suffer in any way from my negativity - so I can write this conscience-free!]"
1,DO NOT BUTY - After One Year No Suction,"I got this for $230 just over a year ago on Amazon. I used it about once a month. Tried to see if I could return it, but it had passed the one year date. It turns on, but there is no suction. The canister had very little in it, but I cleaned it and the filter, but still no suction. I went online and saw that this was a common problem. I used it for wood floors. The suction was never really very good. I would not buy this type of vacuum cleaner again and am not sure I would buy a Hoover.Hoover Windtunnel MultiCyclonic Bagless Canister - SH40055Hoover WindTunnel Canister Vacuum, Electronic Bagless, S3765-040Hoover Windtunnel MultiCyclonic Bagless Canister - SH40055"
4,great service for years,"bought this about 6 or 7 years ago. it has been a great product. Flexible. I have mainly hardwood floors but 2 carpeted rooms. It's worked great until just now the cord is shot. It looks like i would have to buy a new assembly for the r cord reel. $40 ..and take it apart, etc. Instead I am considering selling it as is on Craigslist for like $20 and getting a new one. I'm too old to mess with it ..and need to vacuum soon....so i will probably will buy a new Hoover product. My mother always had the brand- and this one has served me very well.great attachments that clean sofas and drapes and blankets well...as well as carpet and hardwood.thanks Hoover."
2,does not last,"Hoover WindTunnel Canister Vacuum, Electronic Bagless, S3765-040This is my second Hoover Wind tunnel of this model number. I bought it for its excellent dirt and dog hair removal. Neither one has lasted long before the power head shuts off when running or parts begin breaking making it too difficult to continue using,My last one has not lasted 10 months! I did take a chance ordering the 2nd as the reviews were not that positive for reliability. Now I feel strongly enough to give it a poor review"
4,Nice vacuum,"Nice vacuum - works well on wood floors as well as carpet. Need to empty the canister a little more often than anticipated - but not really a problem, just need to remember. Kind of cute, too!"
1,Big Disappointment,"After reading about all Hoover vacuums, I decided that this one was the one I needed. One thing that was missing from the descriptions was the fact that the nozzel/brush does not swivel and I only realized that when I tried to use it. I thought that I must have put it together wrong (these days everything that you buy has to be assembled), so I called the company and found that it was not made to swivel. It had great suction, but would not turn corners or go in and around furniture. I had to pick it up in order to turn it and it is very heavy and the nozzel/buush is much too wide to go under most furniture. Sorry, but I had to return it."
3,ok,The vacuum is great but the brush head isn't adjustable so it doesn't work as good as it should on carpet. I would get a different model if I had a lot of carpet in my house
4,Sux in the good way,"I wanted a canister vacuum and chose this one for the reviews and price. It's a bit larger and clunkier than I had visualized, but it has a good vacuum power. The big carpet head only has one level and the headlight shines up in the trees instead of the carpet, but we have mostly hardwood floors and a pug that sheds a ton. It works very well for dog hair on the floors and furniture, but I would really rather have a housekeeper do this stuff. I'm lazy."
2,few month down the road started breaking up on us,"It is good for the price.However, few month down the road it started breaking up on us. The black wire between the bottom piece and the handle was cut.I had to reconnect it and tape it. The rubber string inside the bottom piece started to come out off the track because a piece that used to hold it got broke. In addition to the dust smell that comes out of this vacuum after you clean the filter. If I had to buy it all over again..i wouldn't"
2,"Very poor quality, though cleans well.","Believe it or not, we were able to get almost one full cleaning out of this product on the first day. And then the motor died. Yes, the power brush burned out on the very first cleaning, without me abusing the product, ""testing"" it to see how hard I could push on the wand, or even using it on any plush berber carpets. Since Hoover closed it stores and authorized repair centers in my state (MI), there's a 2-week wait for replacement part -- so, back to Amazon it goes.On the plus side, it was able to get almost a full cup of dust and dirt, so it works quite well when it does work. Unfortunately, poor construction and lack of support mean I am not recommending this vacuum."
3,Good carpet vacuum,"Moving from Europe to US it was hard to find a good vacuum matching the excellent performance of our Bosch vacuum. This vacuum is ideal for thick US-type carpets, but on the hardwood floors it does not convince me to be a good vacuum cleaner. So that's why 3 stars only."
2,"Bad ergonomics, heavy and bulky. I regret I have purchased it.","Stay away from this badly engineered appliance. It's bulky, not maneuverable at all and it doesn't slide easily on the floor. Old generation wheels are finished with rubber and not silicone. It lacks a light-weight attachment for wood flooring or bare floors (you would be forced to use the carpet motorized brush-roll in off position which weighs a ton). Also every time I use it I have the sensation that the wand's handle is going to give up since it's evident that it's not designed to carry all that weight, plus the suction. It also lacks a general power switch: you will have to use the sliding cursor/power knob to disconnect the motor. If you're in doubt about the purchase of a canister vacuum and can afford to pay a bit extra, I strongly recommend to go for Electrolux Ultra One... It's a more expensive appliance but it's worth every penny: the difference in performance is immense."
1,Do not buy this vacuum,Cuts off on its own all the time. The roller brush turns on and off continuously (have replugged in many times as to see if it's a short).It's a piece of crap. Buy anything else and you'll be happier than I am. Have owned it for 1 1/2 months. Poor quality!!
1,DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM!,"Upon receiving the Hoover Wind tunnel Vacuum I have had nothing but trouble. It will intermittently stop for no apparent reason (Yes I checked to make sure the hose was not clogged and the Canister was not full). The on and off switch has already failed after one week (in order to turn it off I have to unplug it. If you put the floor setting on to do hardwood floors it doesn't get everything up like the carpet setting. I have a very small house 2 bedroom 1.5 bath, very small living room etc it does not take long for the canister to fill up. Just not what I expected, sorry I purchased it."
4,Good vacuum for the price,"I am pleased with this vacuum for the most part. It has 2 problems thoughthat should be fixed.1) The cord is WAY too short. I am always having to unplug andmove the cord to a different outlet.2) I wish that the dirt container was a little larger. I empty itpretty much every time I do extensive vacuuming.However, that being said, the suction is very good. It doesn't leavea dust smell in the room. So overall, I am pleased with it. I should also say that I'm used to a central vacuum which I loved so this was a tough transition."
1,Terrible suction. Starting to fall apart,"I have used this vacuum for awhile now and am very unhappy with it. I'll never buy another Hoover. The suction is very weak. The brush and internal cannister get clogged with hair and lint very easily (very messy to clean). I have also had trouble with the control buttons -- not being able to get it to the proper suction level, not responding by turning off when I press the off button, etc. This vacuum is a pain. Stay away."
5,Worth every penny! Nice,"Recently moved into a new home..looked around many vacuums before zeroing on this one.After using it I'm not disappointed!! Really a nice vacuum and worth every penny..It is not loud, cleans throughly, easy to assemble and store..It pulls dirt at a very effective pace and the only drawback is that you end up emptying the trash can quiet often.I'm satisfied with this one and will recommend it!!"
1,Shuts off at will! No clogs & dust cup empty!,"Had high hopes after reading many hundreds of reviews. The unit was very easy to set up.The problem: it shut off intermittently at will - no hose clog, no metal wand clog - check the dust cup -- not enough dirt to warrant emptying - however, emptied the dust cup anyway, checked all the electrical connections including the wall socket to make sure everything was properly plugged in -- it took more than 10 minutes before the vacuum would respond to pressing the suction control (this is the on button).Received Wednesday returned the following Monday - used twice within a 6 day period and the ""shut off intermittently at will"" problem was even more pronounced on the second use.Called Hoover customer care: they said this was not normal and to return it to where it was purchased. Returned to Amazon - credit pending -- will give an up date on the return process with Amazon once completed."
5,This is the best vacuum EVER!,"Granted, I suppose I'm a bit of a geek, but I LOVE this vacuum. It's not as loud as some people have said - particularly when I use the ""floor"" function to clean the carpet around my skittish bird. The canister follows around after you very easily despite the stated weight, and the ""15-inch powered nozzle"" makes use of every bit of its size - the suction runs clear across the bottom of the nozzle and actually pulls some out-of-reach items towards it. It picks up things that my more dexterous little vacuum couldn't even grab. Finally, the ""telescoping extension"" feature on the wand is amazing. I hadn't read about it in my research, so it was like an extra little surprise. Oh, and the propulsion when on ""carpet"" mode is spectacular. It's a solid, responsive, well-designed little buddy."
2,Powerful but bad carpet cleaning tool,"After 4 years of using this vacuum cleaner I have to say that I did not expect this from hoover, one of the best american brands. The vacuum cleaner is much heavier than the european with canister and less maneuverable . The motor of the carpet tool failed after three years of use and now the joint between tube and carpet tool is broken and the vacuum cleaner doesn't run any more. So I don't want to have more repair costs and decided to buy a new one. Maybe hoover is a good brand for Upright vacuum cleaners but not for the canister type.Pros: powerful and easy to useCons: heavy and unreliable"
4,This Vacuum really sucks,"The suction on this Vacuum is so powerful I hope I have carpet left when I'm done using it. I just returned my Kenmore Progressive and purchased the Hoover. I thought the Kenmore had good suction until I vacuumed with this vacuum. I had to empty the dust cup 4 times on the first vacuuming after the Kenmore. That is one of the reasons I gave it 4 stars, the dust cup capacity is too small. The other reasons is the on board attachments are very small and the power cord could be a little longer. Other than that I have recommended this Vacuum to my family and friends. For the money you can't beat it."
3,There are better options out there given the price,"This vacuum does what it promises, but you're better off spending ~$50 more and getting a top-of-the-line canister vacuum or Dyson upright. This bagless vacuum loses its suction quickly and easily, and unless you want to be emptying the canister and cleaning the HEPA-type filter after each room, it's likely to overheat."
1,Amazon/Hoover Experience,"I purchased the Hoover WindTunnel Canister Vac in Jan, 2011. I purchased it because I had the same vacuum previously & it held up pretty well. Got the ""new"" one and started having problems - every time I picked up the nozzle, the entire machine would shut off. I took the machine to an authorized Hoover repair shop and have since found out that the actual ""new"" machine was built in 2007 - hence I have a machine that is essentially 4 years old in technology and the repairs might not be covered under warranty (which takes 4-6 WEEKS for approval from Hoover)due to the ""age"" of the vac. I've had excellent service from Amazon in the past but don't think I'll be buying appliances through them in the future. When I purchase something of this expense, I'd like to know I'm getting the most up-to-date product available."
1,simply too heavy and clumsy,"It's a powerful machine, does a good job even after a year. what i don't like is that the wand is heavier than the cannister, it doesn't swivel and has to be wrestled with. This vacuum is very clumsy, a pain to use, and i leave it for my cleaning lady to use. i choose one of two other vacuums in my house; i simply don't want to bother with this one."
1,It's great if you like Filthy floors and throwing away money,"Far and away the most poorly designed product since the Yugo. The belt came off within the first few hours of light use. I put it back on. It came off again. Rinse and repeat. I sent it back. They sent a replacement. The belt came off. Of course it did: It's designed wrong. There's nothing to hold it there, so it comes off. I would, too.If you're planning on buying this anyway, try this first instead: Line up about 170 one-dollar bills on a 10 x 17 square. Tape the edges together. Lay it over your rugs and floors to keep them clean. At least it'll last longer than this thing did, and you won't need to go to all the trouble of digging for Hoover's phone number."
1,Wind Tunnel runs out of wind...,"The first one we received had a defective power beater (would not turn) and the replacement we received would not turn off unless we pulled the plug from the outlet. Also, it intermittently would not turn on. I would not waste my time nor my money on this vacuum."
3,Good power but needs constant cleaning of canister,"From a pure suction vantage point, this machine is awesome. It sucks everything up. It's relatively easy to maneuver. It looks sturdy and well made. BUT the canister fills up quickly, so you often have to dump it out. I've always had vacuums with bags so never had to deal with this before. It's a definite downside for me. AND the filter is a pain to clean. You have to use this little brush to clean between the cylindrical filter's grooves (and there are many). All the while, dust is flying in your face. I take it outside to clean and try not to breathe while doing so. It's a bit inconvenient. I guess if your main goal is to save a few bucks on bags then this is the product for you. My next vacuum will be one with bags!"
4,Finally Found the one I like,"I have been buying vacumns that cost no more than $100 for years. The last vacumn bagless Shock upright was the worst. I finally said you get what you pay for.I looked over all the reviews on the Hoover before I purchased it. I just love it. What a big difference compared to the other vacumns I had through the years. I cannot say enough about this Hoover. It is easy to assemble, light weight, retractable cord (that I love), the upholstery cleaner & other attachments pick as well. This little thing really cleans the carpets & wood floors. The cup is easy to take out & put back after cleaning. Do not believe that cannister vacumns do not work well on carpets, that simply is not true at all. It picks up on carpets & makes them look like new. It is just a great vacumn & so far so good. Five stars to Hoover."
3,"Good vacuum, but cheaply made","It's a very good vacuum, except for a plastic piece that has already broken off (after only one month of use). Fortunately, the piece that broke off is the quick release button, so you can still release the hose by pushing down on the metalic button. Other than that, the vacuum is great. Easy to use, really good suction power, and great accessories. I would recommend, but hopefully nothing else will break."
2,Not a good product,"I had the product for only 3 months before I had to take it for repairs. The vacuum gets clogged almost every time it is used. Also, the canister gets filled up way too fast. Definitely not worth the money."
1,don't buy this!,"I bought this vacuum cleaner from Amazon a year or so ago after checking it out in Consumer Reports, where it scored quite highly, ahead of a Dyson model. I paid about $350 for it. It has since gone down in price, quite rightly. I have mainly hardwood floors, and using this machine on them is totally frustrating. Toss a few sesame seeds on the floor and try to vacuum them up. Pass after pass will leave them untouched. On carpets, it may be better. It does grab into the carpet, but I don't have a good feel for its cleaning ability. My girlfriend has a Dyson and thinks highly of it. I wish I had spent the extra money and got a Dyson instead. I don't know why some other reviewers have given it 4 or 5 stars. Consumer Reports--you really screwed up!"
4,thumbs fup for Hoover WindTunnel Canister Vacuum,"I have a vacuum built into my house, but it is cumbersome and heavy to drag around and is not good on stairs. My housekeepers hate it and would bring their own vacuum to clean my house. They and I both love the new Hoover. Once I figured out how it all worked, I find it very easy to change from carpet to floor, and change the cleaning tools. It is relatively light, and my house is so much cleaner than it has been with the other vacuum types.I would give it 5 stars, but because of the plastic parts in some areas, I am a little concerned they could break easily. I hope that is not the case. It is an excellent cleaner, and I would buy again. It has a separate cleaner for carpeted stairs and it does a very good job on those. I recommend."
2,Wonderful Suction until it dies....short cord,"I have had to edit my original review. I loved this vacuum for about 6 months. Then, it began shutting off in the middle of vacuuming. I took it to Sears to be repaired and they had the machine for 4 weeks before I got it back. The first time that I used it, it shut off every 4 minutes or so. After contacting Hoover again, they agreed to send me a new vacuum. The one they sent is a different model, however. Hopefully, this one will pick up pet hair as well as the last one did!One other drawback that I have found is that the cord is much shorter than my last vacuum. I have to stop to unplug more often. ."
1,Loved it for 2 months untill the rotating brush quit working,"I bought this vacuum 2 months ago and loved it. The suction is great and I didnt mind emptying the canister. I used it about once a week for 2 months until the rotating brush started getting bogged down on rugs first, then on the regular carpet. Now the only way to get it to work is to hold the handle up so that the brushes are barely touching the carpet, otherwise the brush stops, like the motor is dying. I am in the process of trying to go thru the warranty for replacements. I do not have high hopes considering that every poor review I've read says that nothing was done.The suction still works great, but if the power carpet roller doesnt work, its worthless. I'm so disgusted I could cry after the money I spent. I'll never buy another Hoover. If you're researching vacuums there are many to choose from. I'd stay clear of Hoover."
3,Most Digusting...,"It does suck up dirt and fur wonderfully, but it's so disgusting and messy to have to empty the canister and clean the filter that I hate using it. You have to empty it almost after every room because the pail is so small. I'll never own a bagless vacuum again."
2,"Started of great...18 months later, problems with electrical connections","This product has great power and does a good job cleaning. The filters require cleaning after every use, so it is much better to have a replacement filter that you can pop in and use while the other is drying after washing.18 months into using this product, it shuts itself off while using the power floor attachment. Now we have to go through the trouble of finding a repair shop (closest is 30 minutes away).I am disappointed in the quality since hoover is supposed to be one of the best."
3,Wonderful--for 3 years,"I purchased this product 3 years ago, and until recently, it has worked perfectly. It is lightweight, easy to use, quiet, and sucks like none other. Unfortunately, after 3 years, the suction diminished almost overnight. I would consider replacing it with the same product, but I was hoping for a more reasonable lifespan."
1,Disappointed by this purchase,"We have purchased two Hoover Wind Tunnel upright bag-type vacums. Both are still in working order. We purchased this bagless canister model for our multi-level home. Unfortunately the power supply began to cut off during normal use after about one week of use. I took it to a local Hoover repair service. The servicer informed me that Hoover could not give them a delivery date on the replacement parts. The vacum has been at the repair service for almost ONE YEAR!. Needless to say this was a waste of money. Hoover vacums USED to be made in AMERICA, this model was not. DO NOT purchase this model!!!!!!!"
1,It lasted a month,Today is 6/8/11.. Bought this vaccum based on consumer report. Justed used it 8 times over the past month and the carpet brush stopped spinning. I was lucky that a still have 1 day to send it back. Will start looking for another one tommorrow.
1,same old...,This is the second wind tunnel I have owned both old an new short out while using the rug part. STINKS
4,Sucks like a Hoover,"The attachments are a bit budget and the vacuum dust bucket is pretty tiny but otherwise it works really well. Suction is strong and continuous and pulls up a good amount of dust, hair and fur. Works well in apartment with two cats, keeping their shedding, mostly, in check."
1,Sparks.,"We bought this Hover just over one year ago. Today it burnt up. Really, after smelling something hot, took off the hepa filter on the side. Turned on the motor to see what we could see. What we saw were plenty of sparks coming at us. Looks to be like the brushes on the motor went bad. It will cost as much to fix as we paid. Since it is just over one year old, and seeing how cheaply made this unit is made, we have learned our lesson. Hover has gone down hill."
1,JUNK,I owned this vacuume cleaner for about 2 months and hated it every time I used it I finally sent it back to buy a Dyson. It had great suction on hard floors but as soon as it hit carperting and you turned the brushes on they would quit spinning. I would have to hold the vacuume up a little so the brushes could spin and actually pick up dirt and pet hair but it took a toll on my back and a vacuume cleaner should not be that difficult to operate. If the filters were not cleaned every time the canister was emptied it would lose a noticeable amount of suction. I read many reviews about this product before I spent $250.00 on it and all the reviews were great until I bought it and now I am so glad I sent it back. It was a total waste of money and my time even using the vacuume.
1,My First Hoover,"I read all the reviews I could find and finally settled on the WindTunnel Bagless, I was a little cautious about the bagless concept and about the comments about the handle being weak. Well the vacuum is great, love the bagless, but I do agree with the other reviewers the handle is weak and doesn't stand up on its own very well. Overall I am very pleased though."
5,Nearly 3 yrs old and going strong,"I bought Hoover Windtunnel from Amazon in January of 2006. I thought my previous vac was doing a good job, but I was disappointed that the carpeting that I had bought less than two years before wasn't holding up very well. It was beginning to mat down. After I used the Hoover on it, the nap stood straight up and it looked new.The Hoover is still doing a great job and I haven't had to replace anything except the filter in the dirt receptacle. I probably wouldn't have had to replace that except that I followed instructions and rinsed it with water. If you live in an area with heavy clay soil, just tap it out on the porch railing. I had to replace the original filter within a few months. I have had the second one for two years now.I don't have a huge house and I am not a vacuum freak, but it does get used on 4 rooms at least once a week and on the two rooms with bare floors occasionally."
2,Easily broken,The tool cover broke with first usage. The carpet attachment won't stay on. Good thing we needed it mostly for hardwood floors ... .
3,It works well when it's not broken,"This vacuum is powerful and quiet. It's amazing to see how much more dirt it can suck out after the floor has already been vacuumed by an old upright vacuum. Unfortunately this vacuum isn't very solid. I only had it for about 6 months (and it wasn't heavily used either) but it broke twice. First the joint between the handle and the main vacuum head broke, causing the handle to get stuck. I took it to a Hoover store and they replaced the joint. Now the small vacuum head (the one you use for staircase etc) is broken and I yet have to take it to the Hoover store again.Also, for those of you who have been using upright, bagged vacuums, you may want to think about it before switching to a canister, bag-less vacuum. Emptying a canister full of dust and dirt into a trash can isn't a pleasant experience."
2,Great Vacuum but needs service in less than 2 years!,"This is a great vacuum. Works well on carpeted and hard wood surfaces. Has good attachments too. I am disappointed, however, that I have not owned it for two years yet (more like 20 months) and already it needs to be repaired. The wiring that controls the hard floor vs. carpet control has gone bad. As a result, it no longer works on carpeted surfaces. I will be calling the service center tomorrow to get an estimate on the cost of repairs, but needless to say I am not impressed with the durability of this product. My other Hoover upright is 7 years old and still going strong, so less than two years is a big disappointment."
4,The Vacuum Really WORKS!!!,"The Hoover was recommended by others at this site and I'm so glad I purchased it. It came quicker than I had anticipated, thanks AMAZON! and it is really great! A friend paid about $600 for a European made vacuum and this one has all the same features and performs just as well! I really like that it has a variable speed switch so you can make the suction really strong or soft, depending on what you need. Also the on/off button is on the handle too, another convenience I hadn't expected. I have a hardwood floor in most of the house and the head for the floor is very wide so it takes less time to get the job done. The power head for cleaning the carpets is very strong! The only part that is not first rate is the bagless. It is messy to clean however you can always have excellant suction as long as you're willing to empty the dirt out and shake the filter! I love this machine and highly recommend it!!!"
4,Powerful and easy to clean,"I've had this vacuum for about a month and found it to be a good value.It is easy to empty and works well at picking up pet hair, too. How itwill hold up only time will tell, but it seems to be made well enough ifhandled with reasonable care."
5,Very pleased!,"I researched vacuums and was truly grateful for everyone's review before mine, as it helped in my determination. I love my little ""R2D2""! The power is awesome, the versatility is spot on and I love how familiar I am with it already (like an informercial!). It does everything and makes cleaning stairs a snap. I no longer have to sweep my wood floors everyday...with my asthma it's no fun. I vacuum more and breathe better. Pick one up! Great price!"
4,Great little vacuum,"The vacuum works great. It picks up everything.. The two things I don't like is the filter and dust holder are too small. I can only vacuum one room and have to empty it. It is very messy to empty, the dust goes everywhere. The other function I don't like is the floor dusting brush falls off the pole when I use it. It doesn't stay on very well. I would recommend this vacuum for carpets."
1,WORST VACUUM EVER!!!!,We've had this hunk of junk for 4 years and have totally regretted ever buying this piece of crap! Needs emptied constantly. Doesn't work half the time. ABSOLUTELY WORST PURCHASE WE'VE EVER MADE!!!!
1,"Unreliable, Avoid!","While this vacuum does a great job when it is functional the power carpet head is highly unreliable. I received two replacement versions of this model while under warranty from Hoover and now the vacuum is out of warranty and I continue to have the same issues with my 3rd vacuum. After a while the power carpet attached is high unreliable. It will keep cutting out and losing power for no reason. As other users have stated sometimes the vacuum will power off completely for no apparent reason, but only when using the power carpet head. I suppose if you had only hardwood in your entire house this would be ok, otherwise I would advise against getting this model. This is my first purchase with Hoover and after this I would avoid buying another one."
5,Mt. Washington Dweller,"This is the best small vacuum I have ever used. Prior to receiving this, I bought and returned two others for lack of power. This one really SUCKS (in a good, vacuumey-way)!!!The bagless feature is great because at the end of vacuuming you can clean the dirt-holder and HEPA filter with water and reduce the dust even further.I have two dogs (one collie), and a cat, and this 12-volt vacuume really does a great job, especially for a canister--much easier to push than an upright."
1,"June 25, 2007 thats how long ago i ordered this and it quit working within a year..... ARGH","June 25, 2007 I at first LOVED this machine.I couldnt say enought about it.However within a year it started to dissintegrate before my eyes.The first part to go was the vaccuum head. It would work then not. Now its to the point i must unplug the unit to turn it off. Next came the release mechanism to use the pipe without the vaccuum head, the plastic release snapped off .. I am 40 not 4 and pamper my belongings. This unit was disappointing and now I need to purchase a new machine...."
2,Good vacuum - But needs care,"[SUMMARY] Worked well for 9 months. Broke in a year.[INITIAL REVIEW] We've had this vacuum for 10 months (empty nesters, no pets, 1500 sf home, cleaning service uses this vacuum). It worked really well at the start, then after 9 months started to fade. The problems are that 1) The belt needed to be changed on the powerhead and 2) The filter really needed to be replaced, washing, 'tho possible was not practical. The local repair joint suggested changing both every three months (they wish!) Once the belt and filter were changed the machine was back performing like a champ. We'll replace them every six months...[UPDATE] 3 months after replacing the belt the vacuum broke. Repair cost was equivalent of purchasing a new vacuum. So we purchased theMiele Neptune Canister Vacuum Cleaner, S4212 Neptune S4 - Turquoise Blueas a replacement. While it cost 2x the Hoover it has run flawlessly for two years without undue care so it's already more cost-effective. It also weighs less."
1,Don't do it!!!!!!!!!,"Wow,I was so excited to treat myself to a new vacuum. The belt DOES NOT stay on the motor. I took it to an authorized service center and he said it just needed a new screw put in......I don't think so. I didn't have it home 5 minutes and the belt came off again. Great vacuum if only the belt stayed on, that happens to be a big problem. Don't do it you'll only be aggravated. Keep looking.......Betsy Steckel"
2,heavy vac,"My reaction to this vacuum is a problem with buying things on line - if I'd tried it out, I never would have bought it, because it is way heavier than I expected it to be - a drag to lug around. We got it in July, and in September, it began to turn itself off while being used. You could start it again, but then after a few minutes, it would shut off again. Clearly this would be under warranty, but the vacuum is on Cape Cod, at least 60 miles or so from the nearest repair facility approved by Hoover. So we'll probably end up forking over money to get it repaired locally, and feel resentful, since the darn thing is practically brand new. So far as suction goes, it's very strong."
2,Broke in 13 months!!,"I carefully evaluated various machines, and bought what I thought was a good, usable machine and a good value. This was used only by my cleaning lady, a careful and responsible person. Lo and behold, 13 months later, the switch doesn't always work, it's unpredictable. The repairman said since it sometimes works, but not always, he would have to put about $100 worth of circuit boardss in to make sure it was repaired. Obviously, I'm not about to put $100 into what should have been a dependable model. Also, the bagless feature is quite messy, and we're going to have bags from now on!I guess this time I'll follow her advice and buy a Kenmore!!"
4,thought it was a piece of junk until I changed the belts,"This vacuum worked ok for a couple months, but then the power nozzle stopped rotating properly. As nearly as I can tell, it is due to the fact that there is no way to adjust the height of the power nozzle from the carpet. The only way to make it rotate is to push down very hard on the handle so you life the nozzle up from the carpet a little. We have been limping along with this thing, and I hate it, but we don't have the money for another vacuum right now. Don't waste your money on this thing.EDIT:I have to say, I have to change my rating on this product, much to my embarrassment. My husband discovered that the manufacturer recommends changing the belts every 6 months. We hadn't changed the belts since we purchased it 3 or so years before! We changed the belts, and, presto, it is working again. The belts cost very little compared to a new vacuum. If you are having suction problems, try changing the belts and see what happens."
1,not a bargain,sells for about $100 less at costco and similar stores. i bought one from amazon. broke after 2 months and i'm told it can't be fixed even though it is under warranty. this machine is junk.
1,Planned obsolescence,"I had owned this vacuum for about three years before the power head stopped working for no apparent reason. In the three years it worked, I vacuumed two large area rugs once a week or so and did periodic dusting. I don't have any wall to wall carpet. The vacuum still provides some suction, but I can no longer effectively clean my rugs, so this unit must be replaced. I decided on a Miele because it's fairly depressing thinking about dumping another 30 pounds of Hoover plastic into a landfill three years from now. The Hoover bagless system is truly terrible, the canister is tiny, fills up quickly, and creates an unholy mess every time you empty it. You end up breathing down all the crap you just picked up; it might be funny if it wasn't so unhealthy."
3,hoover,"UPDATED REVIEW: This is still a good vacuum; however, there is one part that is impossible [for us] to clean out. We cannot get to the section to clean it out. It is filled with dog and human hair among other fine particles and I wonder if that lessens the product use. I really want to clean it out. My OCD demands that I clean the vacuum often and it is driving me crazy. If anyone knows how to get to that part, please let me know.ORIGINAL REVIEW: Have had this vacuum for a few weeks. Excellent so far. Wish there was a place on the vacuum for all attachments, but if that means a larger vacuum, then I'm more than happy to ""fetch"" the attachments when needed. Love it!"
1,DO NOT buy this 100% Junk Vacumm,I would not recommend this Hoover Windtunnel Vacuum cleaner. I stop working after a couple months. The problem was when using the vacuum would just shut off. I took it to a local vacuum repair shop that was authorized for Hoover. I got Hoover due to being a good name. But I will NEVER purchase another one. I will not recommend hoover to my friends and family.The repair shop found that the hose was defective. The ordered the hose and it took over 2 months to get.I have tried to use it today and it will not turn on.I will never purchase another hoover item again.I really with more items was still made in the USA instead of overseas. US quality is so much better. But I have the US government to thank for that.Bryan
5,Better than expected,"We were looking for a canister vacuum for sometime to replace our upright (easier to use on stairs). After reading a lot of customer reviews we decided to try this vacuum cleaner. The first time I used it, I could feel the power of the suction on the carpet. It found dirt in an area I had just vacuumed with the old upright. I was amazed. We've been using it for more than a year now and it is still as good as the first day. It's also very green because it doesn't use bags (and cheaper too!). I would recommend this to others."
4,Light Weight and Efficient,"I love this vacuum, great suction and is not heavy or bulky to go up and down stairs with. Only con would be the length of cord is not as long as kenmore vacuums."
1,not enough wind,"the canister is very small, thus causes frequent stops to empty.just doesn't fulfill my expectations"
2,displeased with product,"I'm not happy with the way the cleaner works on hard floors. It's ok as far as carpeting is concerned, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else, quite frankly. It's also my first experience with a cannister, and it's very messy. I had considered retuning the item but it wasn't worth the effort. The only good feature, is that I can clean under my bed, which I couldn't do with a stand-up. I still use my stand-up to clean the hardwood floors. I guess I'll have to live with it, but I think I could have done better for much less money. I won't buy anything over @20 again from Amazon."
3,Plastic connectors break and are not replaceable,Vacuum has great suction.The plastic connections break easily. One connector broke on the shaft and it cost $65.00 to replace the whole shaft at an authorized repair shop? The part did not fit when I got it home. Another attachment part was missing in the original shipment and had to be purchased. It looks like these vacuums were not made all alike. Replacement parts do not fit from the factory or from authorized dealer? It takes months to get refund for a part that did not fit.
1,Doesn't work on carpet,"I bought this vacuum cleaner after a lot of research. I was soon very disappointed. It worked great the first time I used, but the second time I used it the belt kept coming off. My husband fixed it once, but it kept slipping off. He said it looked like a design flaw. I had remembered reading other bad reviews about the belt, but decided to try it anyway because there were also a lot of good reviews. I have been trying to return it for over a week and having major problems with amazon.com. I've always liked the customer service in the past, but this time I'm having a hard time returning the item that it makes me not want to buy anything else with them. Save you money and buy a different vacuum cleaner, or if you do buy this one don't buy it from amazon.com get it from someplace you can return it to easily if it breaks."
2,Agitator belt problems,"Agitator belt broke once, came off three times in eight months use. Quite a nuisance to disassemble to fix this. Local vacuum cleaner repair shop,(very experienced mechanic), said this was a frequent problem with this model but was good for his business. Advised that only way to avoid this is to operate at much less than this model's powerful full suction especially on rugs. Very disappointing since my wife is now reluctant to use the cleaner since she knows it will happen again - and won't let me even touch it! We bought this because our old Hoover lasted 14 years with no problems!"
1,Buyer Beware,"I read the bad reviews, but ignored them in favor of all the positive. I bought this vacuum less than 3 months ago, and it has totally stopped working. When it works its amazing, and picks up a ton of dust & pet hair. It looks great, and has really good attachment. The body is very cheaply made, and is very fragile.I only used the product 10 times, and it started to randomly shut down. It started doing it more often, and now dosent work. I wouldnt order this product again."
4,good value for money,"Not sure what people really expect for a couple hundred bucks but the vaccuum works really well in my house. I have minimal carpet but three cats and a 2 year old. The vaccuum picks up cat hair off furniture really well. I love the little mini 'power' head for furniture and mattresses. Everything works great, the waste bin is a little small but I truly only have to dump it once during household cleanup then clean it out when I'm done. Loving it for a small price:)"
1,Needs to be redesigned,There is no height adjustment on the carpet/floor rotating brush. Because of this the carpet can stop the roller from rotating. The belt has come off 2 times and my wife hasnt used it for more than 3 hours total. This is getting returned-----Dont buy it
4,"Zip, zoom, zuck!","I can't give this item 5 stars -part of the overall quality will be its longevity. But so far it is a great sucker and I like the bagless system, and the filter you clean instead of replace. It is a little heavy and awkward toting it around the house. The canister needs to be emptied almost everytime I use it, so I wish it held more volume. The little furniture attachment is wonderful. OH! The light on the front of the vacuum is ridiculous. It does not aim towards the ground, so the only good it does is tell you that it is ""on"". Most important is that something in the styling and sound makes my husband want to use it!"
1,displeased!!,I bought a Hoover without a thought since I was replacing my first Hoover that worked great for over 10 years.This model has been nothing but disappointment. I live in a 800 sq ft apartment with mostly hard wood floors with a few area rugs.I can no longer use the attachment for carpets since it will not stay on the handle.Having the suction control and on and off button on the handle makes for a lot of shutting off when you are vacuuming.The canister is heavy and bulky.I don't think I will buy another Hoover.
4,I LOVE MY VACUUM!!!!! So far.....,"I read the reviews on Amazon before I purchased my Hoover Wind Tunnel S3765-040. After receiving it and using it. I love it; light weight, good suction and easy to change container...If the suction stays strong 1 year from now will be another story...I guess I will revisit my review in a year and let you know...:))"
1,to be continued,"Had one of these for over 10 years without a problem. Purchased new one that didn't work correctly from the beginning. Is now being repaired. Supposedly has an electrical problem. Power nozzle shuts down after one or two swipes. Repairman says older model was made in the United States and lasted a good while. New ones are being made overseas and are basically a piece of junk. Will fix this problem but I will be returning with other problems, or so he says. I will notify Hoover if that happens. Giving them the benefit of the doubt for now since I was happy with my previous one."
2,Great Initially - Poor in the Long Term,"Canister vacuum is great for those of us with stairs. The best part of the vacuum is the Power Nozzle -- the wide carpet cleaner with rotating brushes. Unfortunately, the electrical connection at the handle is a point of failure. This design flaw results in the electrical system eventually shorting out the vacuum. My experience is like so many others: great for the first year (the reason why so many give it 5 stars), then it fails and is too expensive to repair."
1,Broke in less than 10 months,"Worked great for about 8-9 months. Used it on thick carpet 2-3 times a month then the roller stopped functioning properly. First, it stopped only when I made long strokes, then anytime I didn't push it slow, then every time I pulled it back... You get the idea. I took it to the repair shop ang they said it was the electrical board on the handle and it would cost $100 to repair. The repair shop also mentioned ever since Hoover was taken over by Chinese company, the quality of their vacuums suffered greatly. I now wish I spent a little more for a better vacuum because this is essentially turning into a $340 vacuum."
2,Overall good but agitator brush device died,"This little vaccum is priced right, a quick pick by consumer reports and overall a nice little vacuum except for the cons listed by everyone else. However the larger carpet/floor agitator brush has broken and we have only owned it for less than 3 months. I am just now checking to see how we can get it fixed (through Amazon or if I have to go through Hoover). I assume this is a one-off experience as I don't recall seeing this issue in any other ratings.Update: 04Jul09 to 4 stars: The fix was simple and cheap - a < $4.00 belt in the agitator. I was told that when the manufactured vacuum sits in the warehouse the belt becomes dry so when it is used it begins to slip. A new belt did the trick and it works beautifully. Would be nice if they provided a replacement belt but for the price and the extra $4.00 this is a value."
5,"finally, a good vacuum","My vac arrived in a timely fashion and in brand new condition (as described). I'm very happy w/it, although my hubby hates canister vacs. However, I've had nothing but bad luck w/all of the uprights that I've purchased. This vacuum handles easily and cleans well-but I must admit I don't use it very often-my weekly cleaners do. I have been pleased w/it the times that I have had to use it though."
5,LOVE MY NEW VAC,I am very happy with my new vacuum. I am amazed at all the dirt it picks up. Works wonderfuly on carpets but not so much on wood floors. The floor attacment won't even fit under my couch and the suction is not so great. So I just use a floor duster to get under there. But it has exceeded my expectations on my carpets! Also when I got the vacuum the handle on the dirt canister was cracked in half...I'm sure I could have exchanged it but I just taped it up with electrical tape and its holding up great.
4,Great little vacuum cleaner,"Pro- light and compacts, easy to carry and clean- great suction- auto retracting cord. You don't realise how much you need this until you don't have it!- easy to get out, setup and then store for quick jobs.Cons- smallish dust can. I found it needs emptying and cleaning about every 2 weeks in a mid sized house with mostly hardwood and 3 young boys.- seems well made, but noticed a little loose fit on the metal tube - air hiss and slight wobble.Unknown- Reliability? Only had it for a month - no issues yet."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS Vacuum!,The canister broke and cracked. There is no suction power. I have only owned this vacuum for 8 months and it is THE WORST. I took it to a vacuum repair shop and it needs a complete overhaul for $130. NOT WORTH IT. I am trading it in for a Miele.
3,Swell machine,"This design is quite interesting. This vacuum is a good example of how to make a simple machine exotic. You can adjust the suction by pressing a switch on the handle. It does a good job cleaning, parts are easily detachable. Solid quality, made to last. Hoover has always made a good vacuum cleaner."
1,Worst vacuum ever owned,This vacuum is a lemon and I want to return it. The belt continually comes off and you have to unscrew the entire piece to get it back on. It continually clogs and have to actually put a rod down into the want to get the clog out. It fills up after one vacuum and we continually have to empty it and clean the filter. I feel that i have been ripped off and wnat my money backand want to know how to return this lemon.Very unsatisfied.
4,"Good suction, somewhat cumbersome","Overall, the vacuum does an excellent job. It is somewhat heavy and cumbersome because I have so many stairs in my house. It does do a great job cleaning the stairs, by the way. Also, the dirt container needs to be emptied frequently. It's not hard to do, but just should be done pretty often."
4,Hoover Bagless Canister Vacuum,"This vacuum cleaner would get a 5-star rating from me except that the dirt container fills up quickly, which is annoying. (I think this must be true of all bagless vacuum cleaners.) The solution is to tote around a plastic shopping bag or wastebasket as you clean and empty the container into it after vacuuming each room. In the long run, I think the bagless is a better way to go than to keep buying bags, which gets expensive."
4,Great Vacuum with some minor issues,"This is a great vacuum! I have not had a cleaner house since using this vacuum. I vacuumed with my old vacuum (a Kenmore) then I repeated with then new Hoover and I got more dirt/dust out of my rugs and even the hardwood floors than my old vacuum.Now for my complaints...the powered vacuum head does not say in a locked position like the picture shows, you have to ""balance"" it in order for it to stay. The hose is too short...should be about 2 feet longer, for more effective vacuuming of items like walls and furniture.Overall this is a great vacuum, Hoover thought of how your going to clean the filters/change/empty the canister, because this task could not be easier.I recommend this...."
3,Great vacuum...but a pain,"This vacuum is amazing. The problem I have with it is you have to empty the filter cup after each use. I do not consider my house very dirty but it amazes me the dust that this vacuum will pick up. I have a lot of hardwood floors in my home as well as carpet and when I see what dust comes out of my carpet, it makes me want nothing but hardwood floors. I can not say I would purchase this vacuum again only because of the filter."
2,"For a bagless it's good, but...","Why would anybody want to buy a bagless vacuum? Emptying the small can after each use is a dirty job and you still need to replace the filters every few months, and they are expensive. For me this is the last bagless vacuum cleaner I'll ever buy."
2,Not good for pet hair,"I bought this based on many of the reviews that said it was great for pet hair. I have two dogs. It is terrible for pet hair.I am constantly pulling built up hair out of the bristles, unclogging the hose, cleaning out the path from the brush to the hose, etc.While it does seem to pull dirt, it refuses to actually clean hair off the carpet, and it lays the hair out in a static-y mess on the floor."
1,"broken soon, only half a year.","I am very satisfied at the first 3 month. Then, the tie is broken, after 6 months, it doesn't work anymore."
2,horror story,bought Hoover S3765-040 2 years ago & it is only used 1x a month. rubber band keeps falling off Carpet & Floor Power Nozzle - the main part for vacuming floor/carpets. was going to order replacement part for $70 but was sent replacement band gratis (normally about $5) worked for a couple of months. warranty date passed. repair locations are no where near where live so why pay $25 to ship it when it may not work. replacement power nozzle that was $70 is now $149. the entire vacuum only costs about $170. I MUST HAVE GOTTEN THE LEMON.
3,"Works well, just difficult to roll around","The suction power is nice. Appears to pick up pretty much everything. Dragging the canister around is not so easy - seems to catch on all the furniture. I had an upright before - much easier to use. The small canister is also only good for one round and is a bit messy when dumping. That being said, this works great for the car and the stairs. If you are looking for a canister vac or something for your car, this one is good. If you are looking for a vacuum generally, an upright might be a bit easier to maneuver."
3,Good for a few years,"Reviews always seem to come from people who recently bought the product. I bought this a few years ago after my husband picked an awful Dirt Devil upright that fell over every time I used the wand and was impossible on stairs. I was so happy to get back to a canister. This is light and mobile and very easy to empty. The cord is really long and you can vacuum everywhere hardly replugging. We loved it. It can't be more than 3 years old and the buttons on the handle work sporadically and it often won't shut off without being unplugged. The cleaning head attachment won't come off any more, so I can't switch to any of the attachments. And, mostly, it just doesn't seem to pick up well any more. It was a good price and has great features, but I had really hoped it would last longer."
4,Powerful and Easy!,"I recieved my Hoover about a month ago and so far love it. I really enjoy how I can use it on every surface even the couch. My roommate has a Oreck and one time after she has vacuumed I did later with mine, and the entire dust holder was full! My roommate has a cat and I am slightly allergic to it's fur, but I haven't had any issues since I got the Windtunnel. The only thing that I would consider a bad thing is it is kind of heavy (about 30 lbs)."
3,No more bagless for me!,"I bought this vacuum cleaner more than a year ago and here are my pros:- does a great job getting up the dirt- is lightweight and easy to carry from room to room- the hose wraps itself up- the controls are easy to access and use- the head is flat enough to slip under low chairs- and all the other stuff people have said is great about it.My one con is that it is bagless. So, as someone else said, it makes quite a dust bowl when it gets dumped, and even worse, the filter is a bear to clean. It takes me a good 30 minutes just to get most (not all) of the dust and cat hair out of the filter after one use (and, yes, I do vacuum regularly). If I decide to wash the filter then I can not use the vacuum for at least a day waiting for the filter to dry out. The filter is not something you can replace cheaply like a bag would be so you have to either clean it or else let it get REALLY clogged up with dust. I am very sorry I bought the bagless model and I will never do so again."
4,strong suction,We are very happy with the vacuum. It has very strong suction. The only negative thing is the size of its container. It gets full very quickly when cleaning the carpeted areas. You have to empty the container after vacuuming every carpeted room.
1,Sudden death,"I was so impressed with the other reviews that I bought three of these vacuums. One for me and each of my 2 daughters. After just over a year, mine suddenly quit working. My youngest daughters' lost much of it's oomph about 3 months ago, and the last of the three has lost one wheel and the powerhead fell apart. This vacuum is a one year wonder. I loved the fact that is really seemed to do a good job cleaning, but it is a bummer to have to buy a new vacuum every year! Another ""issue"" I had was with Amazon. I bought the two vacuums for my daughters last August as Christmas gifts, and learned that one had already purchased a different vacuum. When I called Amazon to return this vacuum, they would not take it back,even though it was unopened, as it had been 4 months. So be careful when purchasing from Amazon for early Christmas gifts!"
2,worked well-- and broke fast,"I got this in July and really liked it-- lightweight, moved well, worked well. But after about a month it started shorting out, and now it runs for a minute or two and then stops over and over again. There's no service center as far as I can tell in Manhattan, so I'd have to take it an hour on the subway to get it fixed."
1,Absolute Garbage,"We ordered this item due to the number of good reviews and the name recognition of Hoover. However, within 1 week of using it, the following problems arose:1. Power randomly cutting out to the head unit when vacuuming2. Suction settings resetting themselves, requiring manual input on handle to fixIt seems like there is a connector issue with the handle, but I haven't been able to figure out which part needs replacing. Phone calls to the service center during normal hours leave me on hold for 30 min; I work during those hours, so I've just had to hang up. Very disappointed with this purchase."
1,Just not worth it,"This vacuum started out working so well that I felt compelled to give it a 5 star rating in a prior review. Fast forward nine months later, and unfortunately I have to report that the vacuum faded quickly. First, the cheap plastic handle broke. Next, the vacuum started shorting out, turning itself off when I bumped an object. The latest problem is that the brush inexplicably and randomly powers off.I bought the vacuum based on the fact that it was given so many 5 star reviews, but 9 months later I advise steering clear of this expensive-to-repair, poorly made product."
1,Worst Vacuum ever,I bought this vacuum based on it's great reviews. This is a horrible product! The controls freeze up and the only way to turn it off is to unplug it. The vacuum doesn't have good suction and yesterday it was spitting OUT dust from the dust cup. The dust cup fills up after I vacuum half my house. The cord is not long enough. I have a 7 yr old Dyson upright vacuum that I love and still works great. This Hoover vacuum is only 2 months old and a piece of junk.Amazon will not return it!
1,A lemon,"My vacuum cleaner worked well the first time I used it, then the power cut on and off repeatedly every time I used it on carpet. It would only work on tile and hardwood. I took it to a Hoover authorized dealer for repair and just got home with it. Still not fixed. I called the Hoover Response Center, and they want me to take it to a different repair shop (located further away). I am sick of dealing with it! What a lemon!"
4,Great Buy!,"PROQuiet, powerful and easy to operate.CONThe filters clog easily and the hose does too.The Dirt cup capacity -- this needs to be emptied after each cleaning which can be quit messy. Empty outside.Overall, I'm very satisfied with the unit. It's quiet, compact, and does a superb job of cleaning"
5,HooverS3765-040 Wind Tunnel Electronic Bagless Canister Vacuum,"I am liking my new Hoover. It is light and easy to move around. The most important thing to me is that it picks up the dirt well...and it really does. Also, I like having choices of suction. On some thinner rugs, the lightest suction does the job and the ends of the rugs don't get torn apart. I also like the how the dirt cannister clicks out easily and it is easy to figure out how it is replaced back. Finally,if something was stuck where the brushes are, easy directions are given to fix the problem. I found out that I don't need some heavy machine to do a great job."
2,Seemingly not built to last,"After having this product for around one year, we are pleased with its suction power. Not as good as a Dyson (nothing is) but good for this price range. The problem is that the rolling brush only works intermittently because of a loose connection (this only started recently). The electrical connections run the length of the hose, so it is important that a) you are careful in handling the hose and b) lucky that the connection does not wear over time. After one year, it seems the time is up for this Hoover and at this price, I would want such a product to last longer."
3,The tale of 4 vacuums,"We had a Dyson it did terrible job on wood/tile floors - gave it to thrift shop. So we purchased 3 vacuums over the last month (Hoover S3765-040, Hoover U6630-900, and a Bissell 37604) from local big box stores. Sorry Amazon too much risk buying expensive items from you when you do not how they will work. The best by far is the Bissell 37604. It is the only one that we did not have to use a stick vacuums to clean the floor where the dogs sometimes sleep. It was the very best on the indoor/outdoor carpet, area rugs, and the tile. Also it is very easy to use and clean. Shows that you do not always need to spend a lot of money."
3,amazing yet disappointing,"My first opinion, because of the weight, was that this was a toy. Then I saw how much dirt it picked up. I was amazed. I used the machine twice, but the third time it wouldn't run. Checked the belt (which was somewhat difficult to get to) and it was off. Fixed it three times before it would stay on. Now I hear a rattling noise that wasn't there to begin with. The dust cup is difficult to empty, scattering dust wherever. The suction, however, still amazes me. I probably wouldn't buy it again."
4,sucks a lot,"I've had this hoover for a month now and love it. Floor has never been cleaner. One small drawback is getting the hose to stand alone. Other than that it's run like a Cadillac. Love the little compartments for the accessories too, so handy!"
1,not worth it...,Let me start out by saying I waited a full year after my purchase to write my review. It is not worth it to buy this vaccuum!!! It works very well for the first 2 months and then It just loses power. The brush stops spinning and the electronic controls work when they want to .. There are times when I have to plug it out of the wall because the power button wont work.. all in all this vaccuum is not worth it. Right now I have a cheap vac that cost me about $40.00 That is still ticking after 6 months!!
4,Ridiculously Small Capacity,"As others have noted, the dust cup holds very little and needs to be emptied frequently. It is deceiving, since the cup itself appears to be quite large, but it is *full* when the dirt reaches just over an inch deep in the cup (this does not take long on a wool area rug). Emptying the cup is easy, but the internal chamber design traps stuff (static cling) so it does not fully empty unless you resort to rinsing it out or reaching in there (yuk).It would be nice if the connection of the handle and beater bar would swivel to help it turn corners.The *powered* hand tool is not powered with a motor, rather it uses the suction to spin the sweeper. Surprisingly, it does work and did not stall out.The variable suction is nice, but it is a bit slow to respond."
3,"Great suction, but faulty workmanship","I am amazed at how much dirt, pet hair, and dust that this machine picks up! I definitely feel like my house is much cleaner after I use it. My only two complaints (you decide whether they are big or small) would be that the machine is a bit bulky and difficult to maneuver, and the carpet setting (where the roller brush spins) works only periodically. It is covered under warrenty, I just have to pack it up and take it down to the local authorized repair shop. Because only one of my nine rooms has carpet, I haven't done it yet. Overall, it is a great vaccuum."
5,Fills up fast...because it works!,"Wonderful vaccuum, especially for the price. The dirt trap does fill up quick...it's supposed to, that means it's working. If it fills up to fast perhaps you should cleam more often. I would buy it again in a heartbeat. It made the CR Pick in CR Mag. Great Vac!"
4,Hoover makes one heck of a vacuum !,"This vacuum works GREAT, lots of power to clean,and it sure will, and I really like the power hand tool to do stairs and upolstry . The only ""bad"" thing is the dirt container is small, because you will not beleive how much this vac will actually pick up ! But it is very easy to empty it out. This vac is Well worth the money !!"
4,Great vacuum!,"After finally giving up on our Dyson, which kept breaking down, we decided to go with this vacuum. I can't even believe how much dirt/pet hair it gets out of my carpet! It is very easy to use, lightweight, and sucks like a champ. The only negative is the size of the dirt cup: too small and needs to be emptied very often."
5,Great vacuum.,"Strong suction, light. If you want a canister, this is a very solid one. My husband was against a canister because they are harder to use. He loves it now when he sees that it reaches places upright would not and cleans better than an upright."
1,this thing is posessed,"Order the exorcist attachment along with the vacuum. Within a week of owning it, the powerhead began shutting off without warning. Suction went up and down. I thought I just wasn't used to the really handy handle controls... but no. The whole vacuum began shutting down regularly-- except when I wanted it to. Then the controls failed and I had to umplug it from the wall to turn it off. Hoover has no interest in fixing it. I have taken it to two local shops. One says it can't be fixed, the other says getting the parts would cost more than the $210 I paid for the machine on Amazon. My mom had a Hoover that ran forever. I guess those days are gone."
5,"Excellent suction, very versatile vacuum","Love this hoover, especially the canister design and it's very easy to clean. No hassle with bags; we're emptying the canister after each vacuuming and a thorough cleaning of the filter is probably required after 20 vacuums, which is totally easy and acceptable."
1,not worth it,"I have owned this machine for 3 years now and it has awesome suction. Even though it is cumbersome to navigate, I loved it for the suction. 3 years into it, and the suction was gone from the power nozzle. We realized that the belt had gone loose so we purchased new belts which worked great for 2 days. Now the belt keeps popping off, and its a pain to open the whole thing (screws and all) to pop it back on. I haven't heard back from Hoover after emailing them a few months ago so I guess I'm going to have to buy a new vacuum after paying $250+ for this one.4/27: I am updating this review and giving it one star instead of 2 because of Hoover's customer service. I have tried email customer support but so far have gotten recommendations about which other hoover product to buy. I couldn't believe it. Like i will ever buy another Hoover product after this fiasco. As of now, I am still emailing them, so will change review if they actually stand behind their product"
4,I like better than Dyson,"With canisters the sweeper head with brushes need some weight to them along with good suction. It's tough to find a new sweeper these days that doesn't have a lot of plastic and has the weight you need for carpet. I bought the Dyson canister and the powerhead was light and wouldn't pick up much of the time on the first pass. The Hoover WindTunnel Canister Vacuum, Electronic Bagless, S3765-040 had a weighty powerhead and worked on carpet much better, for less money."
1,do not buy this machine,"I purchased this vacuum 2 months ago. A couple of weeks ago I tried to pull the wand from the head, and could not release the head. The internal release had broken apparently. I called Hoover, asked them about service under warranty, and was given the name of 2 places in my area to bring it in. Called the first one, they only service items purchased at their store. Called Sears 2nd. Sears assured me they cover the vacuum even though it was purchased elsewhere as long as I could provide a receipt with date of purchase, which I did. Well, I received a call today re: an $89 charge for repair. Turns out no one will honor the warranty from Hoover.It is a piece of junk , and no one (locally anyway) will honor the warranty when it is purchased from Amazon."
4,Hoover vac,Great product. I love how it picks up pet hair. Only downside the dirt cup is a bit small and has to be emptied often.
4,Just a few flaws,"This is a good vacuum cleaner, but it has a few flaws that prevent me from giving it five stars.(1) The handle is flimsy.(2) The dirt cup is way too small. You have to empty it all the time.(3) The upright segment tends to tip over easily as you pull it around.(4) It really needs the optional floor blush to be a complete system. You can order one separately, but to me it should just come with it.On the plus side, the vacuum has good power and strong suction."
5,Best of the Best!,"Absolutely LOVE this vacuum! One day you order it from Amazon, before you know it you have it....You will wonder why you waited so long to buy it this way! I recommend this site and product to EVERYONE!"
2,ginormous,"I hate this vacuum. I bought this one after my Panasonic cannister model died (my baby needed 'white noise' to fall asleep to & after 3 months of running the vacuum nightly for 30-60min, the motor burned out). This vacuum is so big & cumbersome that I dread using it (I'll even sweep or swiffer to avoid having to lug it out of the garage). It's heavy, the cord is kind of short, so I can only vacuum 2 rooms until I have to change outlets. It also tends to not pick up cat litter and small pieces of dirt/paper that are on the ground, so I usually have to swiffer afterwards anyway. I don't have an attachment that allows me to do stairs or upholstery, and the regular head is also heavy & cumbersome to lift & move around. I really liked my Panasonic, but couldn't find it locally, so got this Hoover, but even though I've only had it a few months I'm looking for different models. Maybe the Panasonic again."
1,A very disappointing piece of equipment,"Impossible to clean filter every time you use the bloody vaccum, to empty the canister creats another dust bowl not a good thing."
4,Hoover S3765-040,"Getting a bagless vac made me uncomfortable as I do floors almost daily, having 7 animals in the house. It has worked out fine, and not wasting bags and cost of filters is a real plus. The vac has great suction which is adjustable. And the upholstery attachment works nicely. The only drawback that I encounter is with the low weave area rugs that I have throughout the house. Having to switch back and forth with the carpet head is a pain. If you're looking for a lightweight vac that can do the basics, this is a good one."
1,Brand new vac did not work!,"Received this highly rated vacuum and the darned power head didn't work at all. The unit seems high quality, but something was not right. After finding a number to call (NOT toll-free, I might add), the person suggested I could take item into repair center - and if belt was bad I would be charged for visit - or send item back to Amazon - which is what I did after verifying that belt was indeed good. I felt like the switches on handle didn't work.So now I'm using my duct-taped old dirt-devil, and fretting over what to do - if this highly rated vacuum is a piece of dooky, what are my other options? And really, couldn't Hoover spring for a toll-free line? I feel that Hoover should have said: Oh, how terrible, let us ship you a replacement today! Grrr!"
2,Parts busted on first use!,I was so excited to be getting a decent vacuum cleaner and yes it was great on the hardwood floors but then i gave it a run on the rug and on came this fancy rotator brush which then busted 10 seconds later.. i haven't taken it apart yet but i think the belt is busted. thank goodness there is a simple nozzle for the floors i can use cause god knows i am too lazy to get the broken one fixed. disappointing. why do they need to put those stupid rotating brushes in vacuums anyway?
4,Terrific value...thanks Amazon,"My wife and I were considering spending significantly more $ to purchase a Dyson brand vacuum. I have been an Amazon customer for >10 years and don't usually make any significant purchase without first checking the reviews on Amazon. After considerable research we purchased the Hoover WindTunnel Cannister Vacuum. We are very satisfied with this purchase. The vacuum is well designed and sturdy. It is lightweight (for a cannister vacuum) and creates a powerful suction. The small motorized stair attachment is an especially nice bonus. It's a cannister vacuum and therefore more difficult to move around our split level house. As stated in some other reviews, it is annoying that some of the attachments need to be carried separately. Our only significant complaint after 9 months of use is the cord rewind mechanism isn't working as smoothly; hopefully this will not get worse."
2,Died after 2 years,"Not much more to say...worked well, but then died after 2 years. Warrantied for only one year. I guess I am out of luck!"
2,"works well initially, but not Durable.","The product works well initially, and has good features. After only 3 years of use, the on/off buttons on the handle are working only intermittently, and portions of the plastic housing are breaking off. There is no adjustment for rug pile depth, so the beater bar does not turn on some of our rugs."
2,I expected it to last much longer!,"I have had this vacuum for exactly three years. For about six months now the buttons on the handle have only worked once in a while. Just recently the button for the power head stopped working completely. I took the vacuum to a reputable repairman and he said it would cost me $170 (mostly in replacement parts) to fix it. He also told me that Hoover's are now made in China and that I should never buy a vacuum with a computer in it or one that is bagless because I'll pay more in replacing filters than in vacuum bags. I'll admit I did like my vacuum until it started having problems, but I feel that I paid too much to have to replace it three years later."
4,Great on pet hair,"I love this vacuum. I have 2 large german shepherds that shed a LOT!This vacuum does a great job getting all of the hair. The attachments help a lot.I used the small beater bar attachment and it got all of the hair out of the sofa.It does great on hardwood floors, the carpet and stairs.I would have given it 5 stars but I have 2 minor complaints.....1) the cord should be longer2) the main beater bar head takes major force to stay clicked onto the telescoping wand.I have to really shove it in hard or it pops off.Other than those 2 things.....this is an awesome vacuum."
4,Hoover S3765-040 WindTunnel Electronic Bagless Canister Vacuum,I think this vacuum works very well. I am very pleased with the suction. I highly reccomend this vacuum.
1,Good for 9 months only,"Product did the trick for 9 months, then suction power went down dramatically. I cleaned everything and reassembled to no avail. I should have gotten it fixed then when it was under warranty, because at 13 months, it stopped working entirely. And Hoover wouldn't help fix it because I was one month over warranty. I might have gotten a lemon, but I now need to buy a new vacuum. It turned out to be a very expensive vacuum when you average it out over the time it worked."
1,No service from Hoover. World's Worst Vacuum Cleaner,This vacuum cleaner is the worst vac I have ever had and service from Hoover is seemingly nonexistent as the phone lines are not staffed by real people and no one responds to email when I click on Contact. I ordered a new filter almost a month ago hoping that would help but the filter never arrived nor do I know if they even shipped it. All I got was a charge on my credit card which is also all I got from the vac purchase.The vacuum is extraordinarily cumbersome and the flasher indicating dirty filter has been been flashing since near new and no amount of following cleaning directions ever works to stop the flashing and get full suction; nor is there obstruction in the tubing.It it is a cute little thing but clearly all FLASH (pun intented) and no substance.
5,Hoover S3765-040 WindTunnel Electronic Bagless Canister Vacuum,I was hesitant to buy this vacuum because I was not sure if it was going to have enough suction. Well...........it is awesome. For the money you cannot beat it. It picks up more dirt from the carpet than my Electrolux. I have bad allergies so I need to vacuum almost everyday and the amount of stuff it picks up is unbeleivable. Recommend it highly. It does have a small dust cup but who cares you just empty more often. Just love it!
1,Hoover Windtunnel is Junk,"I just returned from the vacuum repair shop where I had taken my broken 3 year old Hoover WindTunnel. The quote to fix it was more than I paid for it. The repairman said they broke like crazy, and showed me two other broken ones that had just come in. Meanwhile, another customer walks into the shop with another broken Hoover WindTunnel. Hers had a broken beater attachment. Mine had a broken control unit. I gave her mine to cannibalize for parts. Walking her to her car, she said hers had already broken once before.This vacuum was great out of the box, but realize you're buying something that's going to break on you very soon. My old Hoover lasted me 20 years. The lady I gave my broken WindTunnel to said her prior Hoover lasted her a long time too.No more Hoovers for me."
2,does not meet the test of time,I have had the vaccum for about two years and have had to fix it twice because of power head electrical cord or electrical connection design flaws.
3,Not for carpets!,"My house is about 97.5% hard wood floors, so it works fine for me - 97.5% of the time. But it's useless on carpets. When I try to vaccuum a carpet with it, the rug attachment keeps stalling & shutting down the entire unit. Sometimes it refuses turn turn back on at all. THere is no height adjustment on the rug attachment. I suspect that is part of the problem. If you want something for carpets, keep looking. I own a cape code, and am able to do the entire downstairs before I have to empty the cup. That's with 2 dogs."
