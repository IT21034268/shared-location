3,Mix feelings,I had this book for a few months now.I have mix feelings about it. In some of the pages it talks about herbs shampoos and condition but does not give recipes or information on how to make them. NOT Helpful what so ever. It does have pictures in the book that makes it nice but the recipes are hard. Its accommodating. If you want to make recipes in the book you might need extra help.Only few recipes I have tried so far.
2,CONFUSING!!,"I was sooo excited when I got this book. But quickly discovered, it wasn't all it was cracked up to be. I found it very confusing. It might be easier to understand if you have a degree in chemistry. I think there are much better books out there that are much much easier to understand"
2,"Good, but NOT Natural","Although I thought this was a well put together book, I was very disappointed that it is not really ""natural"" as I was expecting. Homemade would be more appropriate in the title. Many chemicals, artificial colors and fragrance suggestions, very little on the natural side. I'll keep it on my shelf since the resell value isn't much, but I will continue my search for truly Natural recipes. John Lust's book on Herbs has some recipes, all Natural if that is what YOU are looking for."
2,Not as easy as she says it is!!,"I've made several dozen batches of cold-process soap over the last year. I was very excited to try the recipes and techniques in this book. Oy vey, what a production! I read the book three times cover-to-cover and was still thoroughly confused and intimidated.The book is badly organized and sometimes contradictory. Finally, in desperation, I decided to make the ""Translucent Liquid Soap"" recipe in Cavitch's Soapmaker's Comapanion. Blessedly simple by comparison, and after my first batch the Faillor techniques began to make a bit more sense. .The (Cavitch) recipe turned out nicely, and once I get a bit more practice, I will look forward to making Faillor's recipes, but take my word for it, a beginner would be thoroughly befuddled by this book."
5,Excellent step by step innstructions,"I bought this book not knowing what to expect since I had read other books on liquid soap and the results I got were pretty bad!Excellent step by step instructions! I have made over 250 bottles of liquid soap for a craft fair in my country (venezuela) My Best selling items so far!.Recipes are not quite what one expects for hair shampoos but for everything else (gels, bubble baths, etc) they are just great!I do recomend this book 100%. I promise you'll be surprise at how easy and inexpensive it is to supply your own household with great Shower Gels."
4,interesting show,"Great show, I would have given it 5 stars but it was too short (according to my 10yr old daughter). She liked it a lot, but complained that it was too short... I have to agree."
4,Good Holiday Movie,My children really enjoyed this movie. Very good plot and content. It is appropriate for all ages and should become a classic for everyone's holiday movie library.
4,Little Spirit dvd,"My grand daughters loved this movie. Especially my 4 year old. She watches a lot.Danny Devito is so fun as the cab driver. The little dog, Ramona, is very adorable. I recommend it to anyone with young children."
2,Form Over Substance,"Don't let the number of syllables fool you - Krauss' words are far too big for her britches. Sarcastic and often defensive in tone, this polemic falls short of the academic masterpiece it is often purported to be. Her characterization of Mondrian's artistic program as an obsession with the grid betrays either an ignorance of or indifference to the artist's own (extensive) writings that is shocking for a critic of such high repute. While I support Krauss' broader aim of knocking Modernism out of its traditional ivory tower, her willingness to forego evidence in favor of arguement does nothing to further the cause."
2,nice effort but problems in execution,"While this book deals with some incredibly interesting subject matter, overall it tends to fall flat, partially due to Krauss's outmoded Weltanschauung and belief (although probably unconscious) in transcendental/idealist aesthetics. Although if you like Hal Foster this would be right up your alley."
4,Just like the picture,Typical mouse pad. Cute pictures. The sides of the pad do rollup after awhile of use (like any other mouse pad).
4,Very Cute,Great mouse pad for both a boy or a girl. Got this for a computer bought for my son and daughter to share and I think they will both love it.
5,Standard,"I've designed hundreds of structures with this book which now reside in every state in the US. They have all performed exactly as intended throughout earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and explosions. Thanks Omer!"
3,"Decent book, could be better.","Be very careful if you are going to CUT your hair in a vintage style using this book. I just tried it and am very disappointed. I had my hair cut using the ""long-length"" directions (the author cited Rita Hayworth and Lana Turner as examples). I own almost every Rita Hayworth movie and I know for a fact that her hair was never this short. It is NOT a long-length style. It is tooooo short. Now, I can no longer style my hair in any 40's rolls, so most of this book is now useless to me. Three inches of hair on the side is not enough to do anything...and it looks like a mullet.My advice...copy the styles but NOT the cuts!"
3,"Directions could be better, but a nice collection of photos","This book doesn't offer much that you couldn't discover for yourself by looking through old magazines and photographs of 40s movie stars, but it does offer a comprehensive collection of photos that will help you to choose a style--whether you want glam, farm girl, or working gal. The directions (where given) are kind of sketchy and sometimes confusing...so plan on practicing a lot before you ""go public"" with your 'do!"
4,Vintage Hairstyles,"I think the different hairstyles were wonderful in the book. The part I didn't like was the fact you have to flip back and forth when you are holding strands of hair figuring out what to do with them because of the terminology. I think it would have been much more efficient if the book had more step by step details on how to do the styles. It has been discouraging for me to know that achieving some of these do's will take more time than necessary because of the lack of detail in the instructions. I am getting there, with a lot of practice, of course. I do love the idea of a book on how to do a vintage 'do'. For the most part I am thrilled!"
4,Great 1940's Hairstyle Book!,"I own this book and love it!! I'm trying to find all the others in her series. They just don't make good books about vintage hairstyles. I've just been looking at pictures and attempting to make it look similar. This book is a jem! It helped me connect the look and how to get it on my head. It's not a 5 star book because it's not a descriptive as I'd like. You really have to think about what the author means at certain points, but you'll eventually get it and understand her methods easily."
3,Question on this item?,"I just looked at the pages Amazon has on here, says list price is 15.95 (on the last page in the book.) why then, can i not find this book for under 100 dollars?"
1,Beyond dreadful,"Superbly awful. Beyond dreadful. Waste of time, money, and energy. Melodramatic, poor acting. Unbelievable and illogical plotting. Need i say more? No."
2,One of those films...,"where action is almost not visible:( I watched last year ""Phantom"" by the same director and thought it couldn't be worse. Unfortunately it is.The beginning is really promising. Two gay lovers are closing their anniversary date with a romantic kiss. Their happiness doesn't last long however. Car accidents happen.From then on we observe very peculiar serie of events. The worst is that the action slows down dramatically. The shots are loooong and don't make the whole thing more clear.Even if the acting is good it doesn't change the whole impression. The actors seem to be as much lost as I was at some moments. If I had to point the best one, it would be with no doubt the one who portrayed the graving mother. The scene at the cementary at the grave of her husband is still in my mind.Well, the ending...My jaw literally dropped. And it's not because it was so amazing. On my list with the most ridiculous film endings the closing scene from ""Two drifters"" sits proudly in top 3!"
5,Very Comfortable,These are the most comfortable underwear to wear bar none. They provide just the right amount of support and there is no extra material to bunch up. But best of all my wife likes them on me.
5,they are excellent and also fit just right.,i am very happy with the Gregg Homme Black Tracker String Thong.Its perfect when you wear them and it keeps its shape.
4,looks very good on me,"looks great, very revealing but i am someone who appreciates soft textures and this isn't very soft but still happy with it overall."
5,great resource,This book is a fantastic resource for activities on right-brained learning. Vitale's format is very easy to follow. The lessons are practical and easy to use. I have used this book in my classroom and have found that the lessons engage students and help them to understand difficult concepts.
4,ADHD Advocate,This book was helpful in identifying the problem my grandson has. The book is very useful for young children who are in the first few grades of elementary school but less helpful for grades above fourth. The book seems to have been written for teachers in the lower grades of elementary school. There is some information applicable to higher grades and just being able to determine a learning problem made the book worthwhile to me.
4,Book,"Item was delivered quickly. Since I had never purchased a used book before, perhaps my expectations were a bit high. The book is definitely readable and the price was right."
5,Loved it as a kid,"I absolutely loved this book as a child. I bought it so my children will read it too. It seems a bit dated now, but that's OK. Things change."
2,Too many flaws,"This phone cuts off callers. It finally happened to me when I was leaving a message for my wife and it cut me off and said, ""Invalid code."" Quite often, the first three to five seconds of a message are recorded at too low of a volume to understand, and then it comes up to normal. Who was that calling? A high tech feature like a redial button would have been nicer than the putzy two-handed menu button and line-pickup procedure. The off button on the handset does anything but turn it off. You can only remove the batteries. Sometimes the handset goes insane when in the cradle and you have to yank the batteries. Save your money."
2,So-So,"The phones are great when they work. We have a new business and needed intercom with handsets. It the base has a bad hair day the system won't work. If it is working, it works great. We have spent lots of time getting the lines and etc. to work and about ready to give up (like right not when I started looking for a new system) and all of a sudden it starts working again. If it works, don't touch it."
1,Complete piece of S***,Sound quality is poor more than about 20' away. I had to the move the base to the center of the house (rather than the kitchen where we wanted it) to get it to work at all. I had to return a unit. Now I'm stuck with it sort of working but with clicky-popy sound. Don't buy this system.
1,a lot of problems,"They sent the wrong unit, refunded some money, and now line 2 has stopped working, after I invested in the handsets for this one. Bummer."
1,Cuts off callers,"The unit cuts off callers mid-sentence. No reason known, although it is usually the same caller which makes it even more annoying."
1,This system is Terrible!!!,"I purchased this system (base and to cordless units) through an Amazon.com retailer and the cordless phones both consistently have a very loud clicking noise all of the time. I even have the signal strength option enabled and I continue to have this problem. It is so annoying to both my callers and I that I do not even use the cordless units any longer. I attempted to get support on the unit and had no success. The system was purchased new, so I paid a premium price. What a waste of money! I would not recommend this system to anyone."
3,Good most of the time,"This unit has worked well but it does have some bad habits.If a handset totally discharges I don't even try the cradle charger - I take the battery out and insert it into the base for charging.It has cut off messages - mid sentence, no big pause - I have no idea why.It appeared the base unit had died after a power failure - it refused to power on when AC had returned. The ac adapter seemed to be working, I took a dead battery out of the base, put in a charged battery and it came back to life. I put it back on ac, reinstalled the dead battery and all is well again.Aside from some dopey behavior, the sound quality and reception are good. The speaker phone mode on the handset was a pleasant surprise - it works well. The speaker phone on the base is so so - I use a headset instead."
2,"Bad Answering Machine, Bad battery packs","As others have noted, the answering machine cuts off roughly a third of income messages, prompting the caller to enter a security code. Also, the battery on the handset died after less than a year. When I try to charge it, it seems to reset itself and beep loudly every few seconds. I would not buy this product again.I just ordered a Panasonic KX-TG6502B to replace this unit."
1,Sleek phone - Software Bugs,"- I woke up one morning to find my two cordless units with message ""Searching for Base""- On the base unit, I hit the DEREGISTER ALL option- The display unit of the answering base shows the following message:E 2562M51 S51 FDXIMay 15, 200214:12:06All keys are totally dysfunctional. I tried plugging into a different location after 5 minute gaps and all other options.CUSTOMER SERVICE RESPONSE:They asked me to try plugging the answering machine base into other locations around the house after removing batteries from the cordless units.Unfortunately I barely ran out of warranty to take advantage of the warranty replacement process.Please advise if there is a fix for this.I obviously misspent $199 + $75 for the second cordless unit."
1,Just Terrible!,"This phone is just terrrible. The answering machine sounds like someone with marbles in their mouth. A $19 answering machine sounds better. What's worse than that is that inexplicably callers get cut off in the middle of their message. Also you can be assured that if line two rings while line 1 is taking a message the answering machine cuts off. Switching lines or using the built in address book is totally non-intuitive. It reminds me of the original calculators using reverse polish notation. (no slur intended) Normally, when one wants to make a call, we pick up the receiver and dial right? With this phone you must select your line, scroll through the address book to find the number you wish to call, go through the menu system and only then pick up the handset and it auto-dials. I could go on and on but lets just leave it at JUST TERRIBLE."
4,Great Phone System without the answering machine,"Like other reviewers, I had the same problem with about 25% of line one calls cut off and the answering machine asking the caller for a security code. I tried 3 different E2562 phones including one replaced by AT&T.; All the replacements had the same disconnect problem on line one. Line two was perfect on all phones.The reason I'm giving this phone 4 stars is that I overcame the answering machine problem by using my phone providers voice mail for line one. The E2562 is far superior to other 2 line systems I've tried including Uniden and VTech. The E2562's sound quality, speakerphone quality and ease of use are the best I've found in any phone. The handsets have a good feel and battery life is excellent.If you can live with the answering machine snafu, this is the best 2-line expandable phone system at an affordable price."
1,"Extremely annoying, do not buy, especially for a business.","Bought it for my new retail store and hate it almost as much as my customers who try to leave messages and just get cut off. It may have cost me sales, who knows.One of the cordless handsets has a battery that is defective.It is also common to think you have keyed in a whole telephone number only to find after a while of waiting to hear a ringtone that the key pad didn't register one of the buttons you pressed. We now spend time very deliberatley pressing the numbers to avoid wasting even more time.The only reason I haven't changed it yet is that I work so many hours I have had no time. When I do buy a new one I intend to destroy this model with a mallet, or by rolling over it with my truck. I feel I need revenge and satisfaction. Terrible product."
1,Let's see what comes next!!,"Yes- I got the corny old Charles Starrett movie as well and have requested a replacement - I would really like to see the Rod Cameron movie that has achieved a somewhat ""cult"" status along with ""Short Grass"" and ""Panhandle"""
2,Not even close,"I would have passed over this fish-out-of-water Tosca if it weren't for the five-star review. I find it misleading to describe Carol Vaness as a great or even satisfactory Tosca. Her singing is plain and totally un-Italianate. In addition, she lacks fire as a vocal actress, coming across as she does at the Met, as a serviceable soprano best suited for Mozart. One thing she's quite ill-suited for is verismo, and the beefy, stalwart Cavaradossi that she's paired with is no hlep. The only interesting thing is Muti's souped-up orchestral work, but even he seems rather discouraged."
5,Bloody Brilliant!!,"What good is a book full of insightful and exciting information if it's too boring and complicated to read? This book gets to the point and does it in an entertaining way. Awesome details on what makes great companies stand out in an overcrowded me-too, over-supplied world. Thank God for authors who not only want to make a great point but want to do it in a plain and easy to read manner. Best book I've read in years!"
4,Great insight...,"I think the book topic and issues are great. It is a fun and insightful read, but at times a little long-winded.Anyway, definitely recommended as an excellent business and management book for anyone looking to manage a little different from the competition."
5,Mavericks for the Enterprise 2.0,"This is a thought provoking book about how the business landscape is changing and innovators in their sectors are winning. The book is well articulated in 4 sections, each of 3 chapters: rethinking competition, reinventing innovation, reconnnecting with customers and redesigning work. Each resembles the findings of the authors during their long journey in search of new ways of doing business. The section on innovation is compelling. The authors also provide a lot of annotated references that by themselves are worth the price: the Appendix Maverick Material (20 pages) and the end notes (roughly 20 pages too). Being aware of the Enterprise 2.0 concepts, this book also helped me undestand how this concepts can work in the real life."
3,Sometimes overpackaging prevents waste,"Many of us figured out long ago that using the dishwasher can be more economical of resources than the gallons of water needed to wash all those dishes, pots and pans by hand, but the individual wrapping of detergent tabs did seem wasteful. However, every bit of this detergent is used, unlike the powder, which does tend to cake in the cardboard box, especially if there's any moisture in the undersink area where it's typically stored. Also, premeasurement prevents excess."
4,Hedy Lamar in Early Movie Career,"I PURCHASED THIS MOVIE FOR MY HUSBAND FOR CHRISTMAS AS HE IS A HEDY LAMAR FAN. GUESS WHO WATCHED ALL OF IT, IT WASN'T HIM. I REALLY ENJOYED THE MOVIE. I PURCHASED THIS MOVIE FROM AMAZON WHO HAS A GREAT SELECTION OF OLD MOVIES."
2,Bonnie and Clyde,This book is a load of fiction.The characters do not fit the real Bonnie and Clyde.This book solely romantisizes the lives ofBonnie and Clyde in a most unappealing way. The writing style is odd and make the story difficult to follow. I would not reccomend this book for researching purposes. This book des no justice to the alread misunderstood reputation of Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow. I you want fact look elsewhere.
2,Bonnie and Clyde: a love story,"Not at all what I was expecting. I picked it up because I wanted a good cops and robbers story, but there was very little of that in the book. Instead it's all about sex. I only got thru 1/4 of the book and stopped, just disgusted."
5,Finally a phone that has it all,"I had an AT & T phone, when it quit I bought another brand of answering machine and phone. Within 2 weeks I was looking for a new AT&T. They have volumes adjustments for the ringer, they have the toll saver option which is great when you check your messages and it it just a great sounding phone. I had bought a GE and had terrible results. I was told to return the phone and expect a new one in 4 weeks. What a joke. Thank goodness Amazon had AT&T."
1,bad phone,Phone did not work. Charged battery as instructed and phone would turn on mommentarily. Then it would not power on again. Took battery out and reinserted it ant it turned on again and then when out. Tried new batteries and it did the same thing. Did not want to fool with trying to get another one so we sent it back. All default settings for this phone were all in Spanish!!!! Had to go through and change these. What happened to ENGLISH???
4,A Telephone that works,It rings - I answer it - and I can hear the person on the other end. Heck of a deal.
2,Squirrels ate the feeder and ripped parts of it apart,Within days of hanging this feeder the squirrels ate a large hole in base of the unit - about 3 inches in diameter - rendering it worthless. If you do not have squirrels this is a nicely designed unit. If you do have squirrels - they will rip this one to shreds in no time. Everything is made from thin plastic.
3,"Donny and Marie- When it is time to ""Go Coconuts""?","This is a LIVE CD recorded in 1984. The songs are good but the quality is not. The songs are not connected and the start and stop very abruptly. I wish I knew it was live but couldn't find out it was until I received it.When will it be time to release the old 70's from Donny and Marie on CD?? ""Goin' Coconuts"" was fantastic and so was ""New Season"". Those are the CD's that we want, not a live 1984 CD. Also, would be great to have more of the TV shows and the movie Goin' Coconuts on DVD. It's a fun movie and has catchy songs. Donny you are doing a great job with the remastered releases so far but please remaster more of the 70's albums and tv shows. Thanks."
2,CD was misrepresented,"The description of the songs in the advertising of this cd led you to believe that Donny & Marie were singing some of their best songs. No where did it say that the majority of the songs were merely a medley. The CD was poorly made, some of the songs could not be heard. Donny & Marie deserve better CDs than how this was produced. I wouldn't recommend this if you really enjoy the artists that we know Donny & Marie are. Someone let them down on this CD."
4,TO ADD TOTAL TRACK LISTINGS TO CD INFORMATION,"1. Puppy Love - Donny2. Paper Roses/I'm Leaving It (All) Up To You -Donny & Marie3. Little Bit Country, Little Bit Rock & Roll -Donny & Marie4. Heartache Tonight - Marie5. I'm So Excited - Donny6. Heartache Looking For A Home - Marie7.

End Of The Show - Donny & Marie16. Take Another Chance On Love - Donny & Marie"
3,CASIO TYPE CHR200,"For the price it's missing lots of functions needed on a runners watch:The BIG error is on the ""Twin Timer"" which the doc claims supports ""interval training"" (CASIO Guide 3073)You can only set to within 10 seconds !! so if you need a 00""26 second interval or a 3""26 you would have to round up or down to ""20 or ""30 seconds!!!But it is capable of setting up to 99 99 hour 59 minutes and 50 (not 59 remember) seconds intervals - great.Next time Casio produce a runners watch perhaps they should ask a runner.adrian.perkins@neuf.fr"
4,Excelente compra,"Funciona perfecto para monitorear mi ritmo cardiaco mientras troto o monto bicicleta, el nivel de precision es muy bueno.Es sencillo de usar, el transmisor es comodo y no molesta al hacer ejercicio."
3,Terror Experiment...,"This is a bit cheesy. I guess they didn't have much for a budget maybe? It's like a bunch of bad movies combined together. anyways you could say its a rip off 28 days/weeks, a bit like quarantine without the camera sickness, and maybe some others that I can't think of. I'd recommend you skip it unless your that bored and curious."
3,Slightly Better than a made-for-SyFy Channel movie,"While not as bad as some have posted, it isn't a whole lot of a movie, and would be a better deal at $2.99 or less.C. Thomas Howell, Judd Nelson, Robert Carradine, and Lochlyn Munro are quickly recognizable ""B"" movie and television actors, and their experience should have livened up their characters--but it didn't really seem to happen as I kept expecting more from them than they delivered.A ripoff of ""28 Days Later""? Well, it is a gas that induces rage instead of a virus and that about says it all.As I said earlier, if it had been $2.99 or less I would have been a little happier."
4,Well thought out indie film,"This was a pretty good film. The premise, characters and plot were solid. I also thought the performances were good. Generally speaking ""zombie"" films are either campy/funny or merely gruesome. If you often wonder why a zombie film can't have a plot you'l like this movie . . . if you prefer campy, gruesome or pointless you probably won't. Enjoy :)"
1,pointless,"This movie was so pointless and poorly done that I just kept getting up and doing other things, hoping it might get better. It never did."
4,great band that are amazing and the cd got here fairly quick,well love the lordi amazing band got it for a friend for christmas...got here quick and no damamge to it
4,Nice bunch of kids projects,"Like the selection of plans for toys for my grandchildren. I'm particularly interested in the rocking horse, which is developmentally a good idea for little ones."
4,Saber Sham Review,"The dual saber sham was something I bought after having purchasedthe comforter 1 year before. The coloring of the sham was a bit lighterbut still works. I bought it for my 12 year old son who loves Star Wars.I have washed it twice and it has maintained its color although over time,it would begin to fade. Might be better to wash in woolite."
4,Star Wars Pillow Sham,The Pillow sham looks cool. Has Jedi written all over the sham. The sham looks great with the rest of the bed set.
2,Bleah!,"Been there, done that, but this time we'll demand that everyone understand that post-""Chrystian"" religion is evil and destroying the world.The main character keeps falling into situations and muddling along, but will not make a committment to anything. I threw the book across the room during the long blathering mythology lecture of how the world has fallen to peril when ""Gesu"" was betrayed by ""Giudas"". Whatever fantasy/literary qualities this may have had are vastly overwhelmed by the thinly disguised conversion attempts."
4,Good Book,"This book was very interesting in that it takes you to a differnt time and place. Eliana is a very dominant woman figure, and she is very intellegent. Mira, one of her closest friends is probably the most mysterious person in the book apart from Giovanni.The only things that confused me were the religions, and Eliana's sexual prefrence considering that she seems attracted to both women and Giovanni. (Giovanni in the end...)All in all, I enjoyed this book and would reccomend it to people who enjoy fantasy with a bit of magic."
3,fragmented,"This book has a great lead and a few interesting ideas, but the plot is fragmented, wandering without focus. Whenever the book seems to settle down on something (music school, competing religions, evil magic, finding family, oppressive government), that plot line is put on the back burner and another takes over. The same happens with secondary characters; as soon as you like them -- poof! -- they disappear.The ""religious discourse"" and weak Christianity links are overplayed by other reviewers -- this book does not go on a soap box preaching the author's religious message. The main tenents of the two religions are never even defined."
5,One of the best Edwin hawkins CD,"I went to one of Edwin Hawkins music and Arts sem, and it was great! I did not attend this one, but when i listened to this cd, it made me want to experince a live recording in person. I love every song on this CD, my favorite is ' Nobody like Jesus', and 'If you love me', On the song 'If your love me' Walter sings towards the end for about 30 seconds, and WOW he should had did the entire song. It's like the Great James More on 'Thank You' He took over that song towards the end, and put his twist on the song for additional 3 minutes. You get the same feeling with 'If you love me' . This is a great CD, and one of the best by Edwin Hawkins. Warning i think Edwin only sings on one of the songs on this CD, but he the producer."
2,Obsessive violence,"While tempted to call this a typical obsessive romance with some violence thrown in, i feel that i might be alittle harsh saying that. Although not a wonderful, original plotline, it was at least entertaining. A bored, married housewife with kids meets the mysterious drifter of her dreams and developes a deep bond with him while her kids get in trouble and her husband cheats on her on his ""business"" trips. The bond is so deep he gets her to do whatever little thing he finds exciting and that's where the thrill begins. This book is only good if you're not looking for a masterpiece."
4,"Pay attention - this is only ONE ball, not a set of two",The actual product is fine. I just wanted to help others not make the same mistake I did - I *assumed* this was a set of toning balls. It's NOT. It is a single ball. You need to order two. :-)
1,"Love the Blue 2 pounders, HATE the Green 3 pounders","I bought the blue 2 pound Stott pilates toning balls quite some time ago and continue to be pleased with them. They fit perfectly in my hands and are comfortable. According to the Amazon description, the blue 2 pounders and the green 3 pounders are both 10 cm high - this is absolutely not true. The green toning balls are significantly larger and are too hard for me to hold, rendering them useless to me. The green ones are also hard, not malleable like my blue 2 pounders. I give the blue 2 pounders five stars; if I could give the green 3 pounders zero stars, I would."
1,Bad experience,"I just ordered two Stott Pilates Toning ball in pink. They came dirty as they were used and the worst part is they are not filled properly with the sand. One is bigger and softer than the other. This is my second purchase. First I ordered two pounds ball in blue. One came bigger than the other. I used these balls at a Stott Pilates Studio and they look totally different. They are nice and shinny. The one I bought from Amazon, the color is pale. They look OLD or used."
1,this ball is a bust,I ordered two 2lb toning balls. One was solid and was true to its weight; the other one had leaked its contents (sand) so it was flabby instead of firm. I ended up returning it for another ball; the next ball I got was OK but still not solid.
2,Not what I had hoped for,"The gym I go to has two pound Stott Pilates Toning Balls and I like them, so I wanted to order these Stott one pounders for home. The 2lb versions at the gym squish to conform to your hand so they're easy to grip. These are much larger (even though they're 1lb instead of 2lb) and do not conform to your hand like the 2lb ones at the gym. The contents inside slosh around since they are so large, which leads to an unbalanced feeling. I'll probably end up returning them."
2,How many?,I have used this product in my gym so I thought I would like my own. When I put my order in I assumed that there are a pair in the purchase. I got one. Amazon should specify how many are there in each purchase. They sent me another one but charged for it. When I sent it back I am not sure if I get a credit. Just poor management on the part of Amazon.com.
3,bigger than the old ones,"I had one of these from a previous purchase. These here are bigger, which makes it harder for women with smaller hands to get a good grip! :( I preferred the smaller ones."
5,Great for my home studio,I practice pilates at home and this has been an excellent addition to my home studio!!
3,Good,"The ball is easy to use and very comfortable to hold in my hand. I would give it a 4 star. However, I only received one even though I ordered two. It was a part of big order. I left a packaging feedback about the situation and no one got back to me. I always bought stuff from amazon. I guess amazon's quality goes down as it gets bigger. I can't really use it since I need the missing one. It really stinks."
1,Very Poor Quality,I ordered two of the green 3 lb. balls and they are two different sizes. The bigger one feels like it has sand and air in it. The smaller one only has sand in it and it isn't even round! They both have the same UPC# though. I wish I had read the other reviews first before I placed my order.
2,Uneven weight,"I love STOTT and all of their equipment. However, I have had these weighted toning balls for a handful of years. When I received them, one was more stretched out than the other. I thought that after awhile they would even out... I have had them for a few years and they still are uneven. As a result, I hardly ever use them. Such a bummer. I recently found out that the batch I got had a defect with them, but I have had them for so many years that I can't return them, even though they are basically brand new. I do recommend this product, but if you receive product that seems like unequal distribution, return them asap, as they won't stretch out and ever become even."
1,A disappointment,"The video appears as a very small window on the computer screen.Also cannot get the different chapters to work - have a request into to the company, but got no answer.It is also unclear how to be interactive. Waste of money."
3,An Interesting Look at Presuppositional Apologetics,"This volume by Greg Bahnsen is a reasonably good introduction to presuppositional apologetics.The author makes his case that since non believers argue from their presuppositions that there is no God, or His existence is not provable, or whatever, that Christians should do the same. He shows this method in action by the Apostle Paul.Many will look at this as circular reasoning (using the Bible to prove the truth of Christianity). Those who favor this approach would counter that intellectual arguments never sway anyone to Christianity anyway, that the Spirit of God must move in the heart of the unbeliever.This is not my preferred apologetic method, but Bahnsen certainly demonstrates the power of it with the greatest missionary of all time in arguing with strong opponents of the Christian worldview.Regardless of one's perspective on apologetics, this is an interesting read and good food for thought. The downside is that it is rather repetitive."
3,Excellent resource,"An excellent resource from the most successful apologist of our time - the late Greg Bahnsen. While I do not agree with all of his religious views, his apologetics are solid as a rock."
4,The Good Earth,"If you're looking for some kind of analysis on the plot and that kind of stuff, you're in the wrong place. Let's begin...It's weird to watch a black & white movie with all the HDTV and special effects going on right now but sometimes it can be relaxing in a way too. I had just finished reading the book and loved it so much I had to have the movie as well. I was not disappointed. It is a great movie and I'm glad I purchased it."
4,A Classic,One of the classics from long ago. The young and impressionable should view this film and analyze it in school. It should be released in DVD format!
5,A classic film that stands the test of time...,"I have not seen the available DVD. This would be essential to my collection, but I won't pay the ridiculous going rate. Luise Rainer gave one of the best performances captured on film, the second of her 2 Oscars. This is one of the great Hollywood films, directed by the underrated Sidney Franklin, and featuring a brilliant cast, stunning Oscar-winning photography, and some terrific special effects, all while telling a relatively simple and sweet story. Most of the great Hollywood films have been available on DVD at a good price. There's simply no excuse for MGM/UA (or whomever owns the rights) to deny a waiting public this outstanding film. Anyone else agree...? NOTE: The DVD is coming out in January, 2006, and I'm hoping it will have extras & stuff."
2,Poor Adaptation of the Great Book,"I agree with John Noone (see review below) that the movie was awful for all the reasons he'd quoted. But the BOOK is a literary great, and I would say, one of the Best Books Written This Century. Give this video a miss, but pick up the book (I've read it many times myself). I urge Hollywood to do a remake of this movie, but this time, feature an (appropriate) all-Asian cast (like in Joy Luck Club), make it 3-hour long and focus on the whole story (not just the 1st half of the book like in this movie). With such a unique, beautiful and compeling storyline, I'm sure the movie will be a sure-fire hit."
5,The Good Earth - A great film.,Such a rare film of this era that follows the book so closely. A few variations but understandable. Top acting and delightful to watch. A real golden oldie.
4,"i love it for being a MOVIE, not a representation of a book!","This movie has major good qualities and bad qualities. First off, it makes no difference that the actors aren't Chinese because they were VERY GOOD! The beginning of the movie was very loyal to the plot of the Good Earth. However as the plot goes on, the movie strays a little. The movie DOES show cultural differences of American and Chinese society, however, the reviewer who thought that this was the importance of the book was wrong! The book marvelously illustrated the bond that a simple farmer had with his land, a bond that couldn't be broken through flood, famine, or riches. Whether the movie illustrates this theme is a questionable matter if you ask me. It is a classic movie and one that i include as a personal favorite. Like i said, it is a good MOVIE, not a good representation of a book. So most important of all, READ THE BOOK! It is excellent and few movies (if any!) are ever better than the book!"
2,Be Warned,"I love this film. It's epic storytelling on a grand scale and timeless viewing. I was thrilled to see it being released on DVD , UNFORTUNATELY it seems there was little if any restoration on the print used. I have only viewed sections of the film so far but EVERY frame I have seen has surface dirt or scratches. In one section there are long scratches down the entire side of the picture. I was so looking forward to seeing something close to a pristine print which is what a film of this calibre deserves. I'd have given 5 stars if it had, so the minus three is for the appaling print . One of the worst I've ever seen."
3,The Good Earth,"It is my all time favorite book, but the movie leaves quite a bit to be desired. I only recently discovered it was made into a movie but the movie doesn't hold a candle to the book. I appreciate the fact that this movie is very old but it was lacking in content. Wangs father hardly spoke in the book and had quite a lot of dialogue in the movie. Physically no one looked like they were described in the book and Wang hated that no good Uncle and Aunt so much that he got them hooked on opium to get a little peace. Wangs cousin was also a major problem for him in the book and was not distinguishable in the movie. We need to get MGM to remake this movie."
4,stant locking gas cap review,"Gas cap works fine. Should accomplish my goal of making it harder for someone to steal gas, although it seems that it would not much effort for a thief to circumvent the locking gas cap."
4,Tougher than a chastity belt to get undone.,Carrying the key around is the only negative. I can't describe enough how much I love pumping that gas now that I know it's safe inside ma cahr's bellay
4,works for me,"a little extra time at the pump but, a valuable asset. Bought it for a 88 chevy celeb. works like a charm."
4,Just when you think you know what to expect from Reginald Hill...,"Maybe this isn't quite tip top for the author, but it's pretty darn close. Light hearted compared to some, yes, although Hill practically always will have you smiling with he so very English dialogue and the overbearing personality of Daziel. However, Hill keeps you also interested in the minor characters such as wield and Singh. But the character of Patrick Aldermann who might be a murderer although the deaths surrounding him appear accidental makes this especially worth reading. I personally consider Reginald Hill, Val McDermitt, and Charles Todd as my favorite mystery authors, although Peter Robinson comes close."
2,"Great shoes, poor customer service","This is my upteenth pair of Shadow 6000: I've run two of my six marathons in them. The shoe is one of the last shoes with a polyurethane midsole, which provides for me the best level of shock absorption: not overly firm with good rebound. You don't bottom out with these shoes. Provides a good base for my orthotics. But Amazon sat on my order for 5 days before shipping! This is poor, unattentive customer service!!"
1,"It doesnt look the same as the picture, SAVE UR MONEY!","I bought these pair and when it arrived, i was really frustrated.Quality wise, fitment wise it's just not good.I wear a size 9.5 and the one's I've got was too snug to wear,so if you're buying this shoes, buy an inch bigger. I returned this sucker ASAP and got me a pair of the NEW BALANCE 992.SO i Wouldn't recommend this shoes regardless. SAVE ur MONEY, save a hassle."
5,Like the Grapes of Wrath - Try this book!,"""The setting of this important story is World War I in rural Oklahoma and the personal and community relationship among the farmers, the banks, and the government. This book will remind the reader of The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck."""
3,"SIMPLY ""OKAY"" HORROR MOVIE",THIS SLASHER FILM HAS A LOT OF SEXY WOMEN IN IT.THE PLOT IS NOT TOO GOOD AND IT IS VERY LOW BUDGET.LOTS OF 'EYE CANDY'.
1,Head in the clouds?,"Anyone who believes that reading this little book is the secret to wealth & happiness is probably so busy trying to find the end of that rainbow that they miss Ed McMahon when he comes to the door with your check. Chant away you freaks - the key to financial 'abundance' is not picking the right lottery numbers (although that would kinda work too) but in choosing the right career path, ie: a job that you actually have an interest and talent in, and finding a way to make it work for you. As my Dad always said, nothing in life is free. So please, people, put your feet on the ground, stop reaching for the stars, and take this long-distance dedication to heart - find what you're good at, be happy with your choice, put in the leg-work, and eventually abundance will find you. As for this little book, the only person to whom it brought abundance was the author."
4,the Abundance Book Review,The book was exactly what i thought it would be. It was motivational and inspiring. I read it in one sitting. It makes for a good read.The Abundance Book [ABUNDANCE BK]
4,Where's the meat?,"This is a good book. It is clearly on the right track. We obviouly benefit from improved spirituality. Meditation is a great beginning, but where do you go from there? Where's the meat of abundance in this world? How do we actually get the thing we want?If you like this book, you will love ""I'm Rich Beyond My Wildest Dreams. I am. I am. I am."" by Thomas L. Pauley and Penelope J. Pauley. Here a father/daughter team tells us the story of their family's rise to wealth and happiness using a revolutionary new system for success 'as old as Abraham and as potent and full of possiblity as a new born child.' I love this book it gives us the tools to get the things we want in this life."
5,Awesome little book,This is one of the best books I have ever participated in. I say that because there is a 40 day process to do in the book. Some friends of mine and myself are almost finished with our 2nd go round. The changes in or lives have been dramatic to say the least. I absolutely recommend this book to all human beings. But you must follow the rules very carefully and commit to the 40 day exercise. Have fun with it.
2,Sometimes I Wonder,"""...Renounce all claims to humanhood and mortality,"" writes Price. ""Care not what is going on in your world . . . and return to the Father's House where you have belonged ever since you left under the spell of mortality."" But we are human. We are mortal. And is that such a bad thing? What's wrong with being human? Is it some sort of punishment? I thought it was an honor, a pleasure, a joy to be human. I can understand needing to align our personalities more with our souls or spiritual nature. But to cast aside our personalities, our humanness, our mortality, seems off center to me. I'm not ashamed of my humanness--why should I ""renounce"" my claim to mortality? Who ever said being human is lower than being a spirit? If so, then why are we in these miraculous physical bodies? To perform some sort of penance? That's not my idea of celebrating life as a human in this beautiful world."
1,Don't believe the hype,"Based on various positive reviews, I was very eager to read this book. I read it from cover to cover and I'm disappointed. I completed the 40 day properity plan in February of this year. I took a leap of faith and followed the plan exactly by doing it over 40 consecutive days as the book requires. It took two attempts before I was successful. While I write this review seven months later, I have not received any financial blessings in my life. The promises of abundance did not come to pass. For the record, I am a Christian and believe in Jesus Christ as my savior. I listen to religious programs on the radio and read the Bible from time to time. Just because a book mentions God doesn't mean it's any good. I should have known better."
1,skip it!,"I've read +30 LOA books, abundance, manifesting, etc. and I didn't find anything new in it."
5,Excellent. Insightful.,"If you are (a) really stuck financially, and (b) open to new insights, particularly about the relationship between Spirit and Supply, this book is for you. Another reviewer noted, ""Don't be fooled by its small size."" Indeed...At the book's core is the 40 Day Abundance Plan. The Plan works. However, it requires discipline -- which, unfortunately, many lack. The is not about some imaginary Free Lunch in the Sky. This is about developing Abundance in one's life by developing spiritually. It must be followed fully with attention to detail, with care...One of the side benefits of following the Plan is an increase in abundance of joy. Spend the money (modest). Buy the book. Follow the Plan. Blessings."
4,Is God Your Source of Abundance?,"If you believe in God (or in a Higher Power of any kind), then this book can help you to TRUST that God/Your Higher Power is the one, true source of your abundance.Author John Randolph Price gives a quick compilation of ""Prosperity Writings"" in this little book, and then goes on to give the reader a ""40 Day Prosperity Plan."" The plan is basically a series of ten meditations that focus one's thoughts on GOD as the Source and Supply of all Abundance in one's life.The book is well-done in that it is short, to the point, and sure to help a reader, provided, as I already said, that the reader has some belief in God/Higher Power.I couldn't give it 5 stars because if a reader does NOT have the above mentioned belief, they won't get much from the book.Still, good reading for those who want to approach Prosperity from a Spiritual standpoint.Reviewer: Linda Painchaud from Park Edge Books"
4,Interesting read,Interesting read.I found it very inspirational and a very refreshing perspective on things. Definitely something I could possibly recommend to others.
4,Very Insightful,"John has a way of packing so much pertinent information into each and every sentence. If you are ready to take control of your life and have a desire to really look at who you have been up till now, this book will help you see the power of your mind and how you can really get what you want in life."
5,Love the Abundance Book!,I had to purchase this for an exercise at work with my co-workers. So far I have enjoyed the principles even though at times I find meditating to be a tad difficult. I find some of this information to be a bit outdated but that is obviously because the principles have been working and changing lives for quite a long period of time. I would definitely recommend this little book to any family members or friends. We can always use a little prosperity and abundance!
4,Nice Fingerstyle Guitar,Local Joe is a nice album. If your a fan of fingerstyle Guitar then you'll probably like this music. Most of the songs are acoustic guitar solos. A few have vocals. I also recommend Pat Donohue - another great fingerstyle guitar player.
3,To each his own,"I'm very sorry but I disagree with almost all of the above reviewers,Andrea Bocelli has a beautiful voice and he also has a clear diction but he is simply NOT an opera singer. I'm italian and I saw him live in Bohème in Cagliari and even though a recording studio can do miracles he still is not capable of sustaining a full opera on stage.Therefor I find it very irritating,this could have been a very good recording because the rest of the cast is excellent and the fact that an international recording company decides to use an amateur just because he's famous is quite scandalous!!!!!!!!! Adam Lorenzetti"
1,"Cheap, and not made by Microsoft","It charges up the Zune, but forget about synching content. Two different computers, trying all the USB ports available, and would get to about 50% synch and fail. Still have my original Zune cable and I don't see this issue. Get what you buy for in this case."
4,Not Bad.,"It's not bad for the price. It feels cheaper than Zune's OEM sync cable. The connector and the cable doesn't feel as solid as the OEM cable. For the price, it met my expectation. It gets the job done. I've had it for 2 months and it still works fine. After I bought this cable, I picked up an Altec Lansing speakers at a deep discount. The speakers charge and sync the Zune (through optional USB cable) as well. The price on Zune accessories have come down a lot. Before you buy this cable, you may want to check out Zune accessory packages that come with a sync cable. This site doesn't always have the best price. You may need to look around a bit."
5,Works as advertized!,does what it's supposed to do... charges Zune when plugged into computer...Can't ask for more...Might need to get a spare...
1,Threw it out.,"As best as I can tell the wires were too thin, and it could not handle any kind of bandwidth."
1,Review,I cannot review this product since I still have not received it. I am told it was shipped 4/28/09. It is now 6/4/09 and the book is MIA.
5,one happy customer!,"thank you amazon as this movie is not available in australia.my sister was very happy to receive it for her birthday,and it arrived earlier than expected and in excellent order."
4,big helper,great price...and you can save a lot of money doing it your self...best way to add fluid to your 2006 ford...
4,Good Graduate Book,"This book is good for the High School Graduate because the simple metaphors and stories make this book clear in a world full of obscur rules and references. I liked this book because it did speak in straight forward terms. An older audience may see this as a dribble of old advice, but to a younger man this is new wisdom."
3,A great start.... but an agonizing contrived finish.,"Like many, I loved the book for the first 200 or so pages, but the book turned into an incredibly contrived story. The eventual relationship between the book's two main characters was predictable, although a pleasant eventuality. But, once the relationship develops, the book really heads downhill. Segal clearly wanted to tie every single character of the book together for a final bang at the end, but unfortunately the ending of the book took 200 pages longer than it should have. The description of the making of Doctors was accurate, and a refreshing description of what is frequently sensationalized by the mainstream media. Getting the characters through their medical school training and their residencies is clearly worth the read. Unfortnately the rest of the book is not. My general sense is that Segal tried to take too big a bite."
3,"""Soaping"" Up With The Doctors","Read like a very long soap opera but apparently true to form regarding the training of medical doctors. The book touched on moral issues, i.e. euthanasia, quite well."
3,OK but too predictable,Maybe this theme of weaving a story around the lifes of doctors has become too common. This book is one amongst the lot and hence extremely predictable. I thought that there are just too many life stories of characters hence none of the characters were developed in great detail making the book extremely boring at times. Mr.Seagal's writing style is the only thing that keeps you hooked!
5,Excellent and inspiring.,"I am a 16 year old and I fell in love with this book a year ago. Since then I have read it four other times. To me it is very educational because I am a science student at the top high school on my island-St. Lucia. I understood and sympathized with every character especially ""Barny Livingston"". This is because I hope to become a Physchiatrist myself. Reading this book made me interested in another author-Sigmund Freud.In my entire life I have only read four books- Macbeth by Shakespere,Needful Things by Stephen King,Ruby by Virginia Andrews and this one. It has touched my in a very special and unique way. Thank You Erich SegalBy Jodeth David"
2,Overambitious,"This book simply tried to tackle too much --- the end result is a book that is too plot-driven and unsatisfying. This book would have been better if it were more character-driven -- the characters were stale and, for the most part, unlikable. The last 100 pages are laughable. Instead of coming together, the story falls apart. The author obviously just wanted to end the thing (as did I). My advice : if your looking for a good book on the life of a doctor, keep looking. This isn't it."
3,Nice form a historical and research point of view...,"As another reader mentioned, it was nice to read the historical events combined so nicely and smoothly in the book. The book also gives a pretty wide view on all medical fields and lets us ""experience"" them, and whatOn the other hand, I found a HUGE flow in the book: the story is VERY predictable... Take Barney and Laura's relationship, or various people's choice of residency."
3,A bit *too* beeswax-y,"I didn't find the Burt's Bees beeswax stick lip balm to be anything special, unlike most of the other reviewers. It has a nice peppermint scent & flavor, but the texture is waxy and Chapstick-like, and not very softening. There are better balms, in my opinion, and for less money."
3,"Great flavor, but not moisturizing enough","Burt's Bees Beeswax Lip BalmPeppermint, .15ozI love the flavor of this lip balm (very intense peppermint tingle), but it does not hydrate my dry lips. It's very hard, which makes it long lasting & smash resistant, but not as moisturizing as softer lip balms. I recommend getting Dr. Bronner's Peppermint,Lip Balm Organic-Peppermint 0.15 Ounces, instead of this. Bronner's has organic ingredients, more hydration, and is about the same price as Burt's Bees. The peppermint flavor is milder, but if you have dry lips Bronner's is a more effective balm.Ingredients: Beeswax, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Mentha piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Lanolin, Tocopherol, Rosmarinus officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Glycine soja (soybean oil), Canola Oil"
3,Burt's bees lip lalm,I bought this 4 or 5 months ago and have used it daily. It doesn't have a good smell to it and a relative that had also bought it said the same thing. It works okay. I've been putting it on about 2 or 3x a day. For $2.50 it costs at the store it's a good product.
2,What's with the price?,"It's the best chapstick in the world no doubt, but I'm from Raleigh and I can get this way cheaper in stores here."
3,Over-rated,"Take a piece of beeswax from a honeycomb and try to coat you lips with it; its not gonna work. Burts bees lip balm has too much beeswax in it, its hard apply because the wax is too hard. Yes the peppermint smells cool, but as a lip protectant, i need something more fluid and lasting than this hard wax. And worst of all its very expensive when compared to other lip balms that are easier to use and get the job done better.Get blistex medicated instead, it has beeswax as it main ingredient and it alot easier to apply, and cheaper too."
4,this Beeswax Lip Balm period of validity?,this Beeswax Lip Balm period of validity?manufacture date?exp date ?
5,Love it,"Full on best lip balm I've ever used. My lips are so soft whenever I put this on, its so relaxing almost. I love having nice soft lips, and I hate chapped lips so bad. This a very good quality product. I'm even gonna buy some for my friends and family, I know they are going to love it as much as I do. I'll defiantly continue using this product and I'm defiantly not back to regular chap stick again."
5,Awesome Product,Great Product. Perfect amount of moisture. Everyone I've recommended this to can't go back to another chapstick
3,I love Burt's Bee's products...but not this one.,"The Burt's Bees Lip Balm Beeswax Tube is a product I fully expected to love, just like the plethora of other Burt's Bee's products I've tried...but I didn't. First the scent: like wax. I know it's a natural product, but perhaps in this case nature and I don't agree? Second, the balm doesn't go on smoothly. It doesn't seem to matter if I have it warmed up or not, I get clumps instead of a coating.On the positive side it is a natural product. Since there are other natural products...even by Burt's out there...I will be using those instead."
2,Peeling - Ouch!,"I've always loved Burt's Bees products. This lip balm, however, ALWAYS causes my lips to peel. It feels so good when I apply it and I love the refreshing smell. Within a few hours, though, my lips begin to get dry patches which end up flaking and peeling, almost as if they are burned. I suspect that it may be the peppermint oil.Good old-fashioned (black label) Chapstik is now my lips' best friend."
1,Does not work,"I bought this as an alternative to blistex and I have to say I am disappointed, it doesn't do anything. I honestly can't understand how people can rank this product with 5 stars. I applied it to my lips and it did make them feel better for about 2-3 hours but after that it was gone and the pain back. I had to reapply at least a few times a day. The worst thing was that the next day my lips were in even worst condition than before the applications. I did use the product for the entire week and it works well if you apply it every couple hours without fail. It certainly has no effect on healing though as I did not notice the condition of my lips to improve after a week of use."
3,Not very moisturizing,"I personally am not a big fan of Burt's Bees chapstick. It feels cool and everything, but it doesn't really do a good job in moisturing my lips. I would reccomend Chapstick or Softlips, and they are both cheaper than Burt's."
5,Best lip balm ever!,"I've tried too many kinds to count, and Burt's Bees is the best lip balm I've ever used."
5,The Best Lip Balm out there!,"I love this stuff! If I was stuck on an island, I would have majority of the products. It works so well! It makes you lips tingle with a refreshing minty smell. It's not greasy, or slimly, or glossly. It's just like any ol' other chapstick out there, EXCEPT this works. I used to fly through chapstick. The smelly kind, the glossly kind, the oily kind, and the waxy kind. I haven't found a awesome lip balm out there that has matched this or even came close. Seriously, you'll love it!"
5,"Chap Stik, learn from Burt!","I have tried so many chap sticks that I think that I have spent at least 50 dollars in my entire life on them, and Im only 18! Finally I have found a chap stick worthy of my lips!When you put it on, you start to feel this tingling feeling on your lips and then in a couple minutes your lips have never felt better in your life, this is an all natural chap stick, which makes it even better for people who have allgeric reactions to synthetic stuff. Try it out, you wont regret it!"
5,Shipping prices ruin it.,"While this product is one of the best I've ever used, buying it from Mind Body Source isn't worth it at all. Yes, the tube itself is only 49 cents, but shipping and handling for one is over 4 dollars! That's over 8 times the price for the actualy product, folks. Not worth it at all."
1,The picture on the cover IS NOT Sardinian!,"With much disappointment as a sardinian, the picture on the cover is not a picture of anything sardinian. In the picture you can see Alberobello's (Southern Italy) trulli, constructions that are similar to sardinian nuraghi (which I suppose should have been put there), just Nuraghi are over 2000 (two thousand) years older than trully, and much, much bigger. If you want to write a guide, do it right. Would you buy a guide of the USA that has a picture of the Eiffel Tower on it ? I wouldn't."
4,A.S. Byatt's first novel,"This is a great read for any fan of British novelist and critic A.S. Byatt. It's her first novel, written as an undergraduate (and reworked a few yrs later when she was a young mother.) She was obviously passionate, perceptive, brainy, busy, and full of life.The protagonist Anna notices, thinks about, and feels things -- intensely. The autobiographical story is interesting, and less deeply upholstered than Byatt's subsequent novels. The narrator's immediacy is compelling, and the young woman's struggles to define herself within (and separate from) her intellectually consuming and powerful family are well drawn. Lots of 'characters,' the Byatt ear for speech and eye for the telling detail. Memorable escapades and love affairs, too It's intense and brimming with energy and life."
3,nice,"I purchased this version of a kitchen for my 4 year old son for three reasons. First, he loves playing with the kitchens whenever we encounter one while out. So, I knew he would love having one. Second, we don't have much space for a large unit so I thought this would fit better. Three, my husband thought he wouldn't use it enough to warrant getting the larger unit. It is adorable, but I have to say I wish I had spent the extra $$ on a larger one. He doesn't play with it quite as much as the larger ones, and it's a bit awkward trying to position it so that he can reach it and enjoy it but not have to sit on the floor to use it.So, if you don't have space and want to save $$, go for it. He does like it and play with it, I just think he would have enjoyed the larger one more.It does appear to be rather good quality, and I love this brand. Note to the company however, I wish you would transfer the manufacturing of your products to the US or an eco-conscious european country."
3,Great Album... Won't burn to CD..,"I love this soundtrack, but for the life of me, I can't burn a CD of the MP3 Download.. I've tried an MP3 CD and it FAILED. I tried it as an AAC and it Failed. I even tried to copy the original content from my Amazon folder to a blank disc and then burnt the disk, and it sounds like it's constantly skipping... Maybe some type of built in security setting, but it does kinda suck that the only way I can listen to it is on the computer or my Phone...Any ideas..? Please let em know..."
5,Great OST!,"I just listened to this CD and had to write something about it! Just like the movie was everything a horror flick should be, this is everything a movie soundtrack should be! You have great tracks by Rob Zombie himself, some tracks from the score itself, then other key songs from the movie AND this is great) some of the best lines from the movie are inserted as well! Some you have everything, no rip off like a second or third CD that you have to buy, everything is there! On a personal note, whatever you do, never download MP3s, out of respect for the work of Rob Zombie, please buy the CD. Forget the argument that a CD costs nothing to make and that the record companies are ripping people off. If that's what you think, jerk, think about the people employed by these companies to produce these CDs, they have to get paid too, and don't forget Rob here! So for those who are going to buy it, have a great time listening to that album!"
2,What a let down!,"There are only three or four songs worth listening to on the whole CD at best. I bought the CD before seeing the movie and was completely disapointed. I mean why would you want an album consisting of Rob and Buck Owens? After seeing the movie, which was rather psycotic and made Natural Born Killers seem like a family film, I was able to appriciate the CD a little more but it's still pretty much a waste of $15. Get it used after seeing the movie, it will definitly help you to appriciate whats on the CD."
3,Got this Cd for one reason --,"-- the track, ""I Want To Be Loved By You,"" boop-booped a doo'ed by Sherrie Moon in the movie. It's the best scene, and the one light and cheerful spot in an otherwise dank, disturbing film."
5,Rob Zombie never stops amazing me!!,I went to see the movie and was amazed. It was everything I thought Rob Zombie was about. I loved it and I reccomend everyone to see it! I also like this album! It had the funniest lines out of the movie on it! It had the best instamentals that I've heard! Rob Zombie never lets me down!!
4,I enjoyed the soundtrack AND the movie,"Most people are saying the movie is bad, but I highly enjoyed it. The cinematography is very very very kool. The soundtrack is fun. key points of the movie are intermingled with the songs. Very kool and fun CD. a must have for metal fans (especially zombie fans)."
2,Leaves much to be desired,"As much as I enjoyed Rob Zombie's directorial debut House of 1000 Corpses, this soundtrack is very lacking. It features five new songs from Rob and a cover of ""Brickhouse"", all of which are decent tracks that are more than worth a listen, but most of the rest of the soundtrack is sound clips from the film. While it puts a smile on my face to see a good 'ol Ramones song on here as well, this soundtrack is primarily for hardcore fans of Rob's solo work or die hard fans of the film. In either case though, it would have been great to see some other bands on here as well, and I just couldn't help but feel cheated if I paid a full list price for this. The House of 1000 Corpses soundtrack isn't bad, but wait until it's in a bargain bin to buy it."
4,Dawsons creek scrap book,"Its cool if you like dawsons creek. Its about the cast and characters, their history and life, behind the scenes, best catchphrases and some scripts from the show."
5,The Way It Is,"A great, no-nonsense look at how people actually live while writing crime fiction, heck, while writing anything. This is the book to read while deciding how you're going to finance that writing career."
3,Still testing - (June to August 2010),"Rain Bird Kit RC-Kit is the only solution out there that is a reasonable convertion from high to low pressure for a relatively medium size area (12' x 7'). I checked DIG, Orbits, and Hunter products. It is prone to leaks if not installed exactly flush."
2,Not quite what I was looking for,"This item is exactly what's in the picture. It's a lightweight foam pad. However, I needed something to raise the back of my English saddle and this pad was just too squishy. As soon as weight was in the saddle, the pad was flattened, not doing the job I needed it to do. I don't think riser is the correct word for this pad. The foam is not firm enough to raise the saddle when weight is placed in the saddle. I must also say the company did ship the pad quickly and well packaged."
1,Squirrels chewed it out,"It retains water at the bottom because there are no holes for it to drain, some of the seeds even sprouted out in couple of days after a rainy day, funniest thing I have ever seen. You could create your own hole though. The clear plastic is real thin and was chewed out by the squirrels. I think they need to improve the quality of this product and actually test it out before putting it in the market."
1,Food molds!,"As soon as it rains, the food gets wet and molds. I suppose it would be ok in a covered area..."
3,Alot of the birds land near,"Since I can't afford bird seeds any longer, I fill this up with dead tree bark. Alot of the birds land near it then see that it's useless tree bark and they look mad. Later on, the birds start hanging around my window and they look very, very mad.UPDATE: I've had the Garden Song First Flight Bird Feeder for over 1/2 year.UPDATE: I've had the Garden Song First Flight Bird Feeder for over a year. The birds still look very mad when they realize there are no seeds in it. A few of them have been pecking at my window.UPDATE: I've had the Garden Song First Flight Bird Feeder for over 1 1/2 year.UPDATE: The Birds stole my Garden Song First Flight Bird Feeder."
1,Not for uncovered area,"I purchased this for my mom to watch the birds from her window. It was easy to attach to her window and easy to fill. When she checked to see why not a single bird was visiting --she noticed water (rain) entered into the feeding holes and froze the seed solid! She emptied it and tried again and it happened again. Maybe it would work in a covered area, but not in an area exposed to wet conditions."
4,Prefer First Flight's larger EZ Feeder,"I have both this and the larger EZ fill feeder. While I think all the First Flight feeders are better than most feeders out there (durbable, inexpensive, looks nice), this one, unlike the larger EZ fill, seems to spill a lot of seeds. A larger feeder like the EZ fill also doesn't have to be filled as often."
4,A good account of Napoleon's invasion of Russia,I did not find much new in this book. But its certainly a well thoughout study of the invasion.
2,"If this book is not so good, then which are better?","I am interested in the subject of this book but a review such as the one immediately below by untermensch does not encourage me. If this book is not so good, please identify some others which are better. I dont want to waste my time on a substandard book, but not being a specialist in this field, where should I look?"
5,Awesome,"Books by british educated authors are usually boring. I thought I would take a chance since Zamoyski was born in New York. It paid off. I found it very exciting and easy to read. It is very detailed and thoroughly researched, yet not boring at all. I couldn't put it down, and I wanted more. It reads like a novel, and keeps you hooked. I have started reading his other book about the fall of Napoleon. I would love to see Zamoyski write some more about Napoleon's earlier campaigns."
5,Napoleon's Downfall,"Waterloo may have been the end of Napoleon's reign over Europe, but his ill-fated invasion of Russia in 1812 was the beginning of the end. This extremely well-written book retells that fatal decision in great detail, and it is never boring. We see how Napoleon's fabled instinct appeared to desert him when it came to Russia, and how his indecisiveness was the main cause of his loss of his army. General Kutuzov's reputation is exposed for the sham that it was, and most of the credit for the Rusian ""victory"" is given to the harsh Russian winter, as it should be. This is a fairly well-known story, but the book goes into the fine detail that really explains all that happened. It's one that is definitely recommended for any Napoleon-era buff!"
5,Wonderful words for a teenager to read from parents/love,When you have a difficult time with your teenager these poems are great to read together. The poems help you say things to your child in a postive way when it is hard to think of the right words.
3,Saddly no illustrations....,"Even though this is the journal of Caroline Mytinger, her travels, and one would expect her illustrations... which played a big part in the journey. Her illustrations were not included. They are now considered a rare antropological study of what was in the South Pacific at that time.... no mention, in any of Amazons reviews that the illustrations were not included in this paper back.... a very bold omission."
4,Surpised to find this,"This was a book my parents had in their library which over the years somehow got lost. Finding it again, in good condition, was wonderful. What a great service you provide."
4,Dr. Laura Challenges The Weak,"In this book, Dr. Laura Schlessinger challenges the reader to update his/her thinking to include the most basic of rules: The Ten Commandments. She doesn't mince words and puts forth a challenge to the weak among us (that's all of us, in some way) to live UP to the Ten Commandments, not DOWN to today's moral vacuum. Dr. Laura may not be the best writer around but the message is crystal-clear: Clean Up Your Act, Take Responsibiltiy, And Stop Acting Like A Spoiled Brat. More, she makes the reader examine one's lifestyle, clearly uncomfortable for many. I found the book deliciously challenging and spot on in today's Conservative atmosphere."
2,The Ten Commandments : The Significance of God's Laws in Everyday Life,"I have enjoyed Dr. Laura a lot on the radio. Most of the time I completely agree on her perspective on life issues.But I think she missed the goal with this book. It is very superficial and shallow. It seems written in a haste, just to meet a publishers deadline.It is full of stories from her listeners that many times just fill page after page, often with hardly any connection to the principle illustrated.Not deep theology, but pop thinking that left me hungry for more depth.I will continue to listen Dr. Laura on the radio and considering her books for future purchase."
5,I enjoyed this book and learned a lot from it.,"This is a most interesting combination of Jewish law, tradition, and wisdom and its application to everyday life and problems. Rabbi Vogel has contributed a lot of background that I as a church going Christian of 60+ years have never heard. It helps my understanding of God's laws. Dr. Laura tells of many phone conversations and e-mails to tie these teachings to our lives today."
2,Not helpful in actually talking to kids,"This book was not the guide I needed in expressing spirituality to my kids. Her style is obnixious to me. The book looked good from the description. The other book I bought was so gentle and truly helpful: 10 Principles For Spiritual Parenting. That's the ""laws"" I want my kids to operate from."
1,I wish I could go lower than a 1 star.,"to bad Dr.Laura doesn't really know how to live,If there was a good honest person to write this book it might of turned out differently,,she bad mouths everyone's beliefs and says everythings wrong unless it's her way.I think she seriously tried to alter the commandments so she could look like a better person,She's a hater and this is a horrible book.!DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Which commandments are valid?,"I wonder if Dr. Laura could explain what happened to the commandments God gave Moses the first time (which he smashed) and the second set of commandments? Except for three, they are all different. Did God change his mind between visits?There is nothing new or unique about the commandments. They existed in other forms and religions before Moses came along. Man is fond of making ""Behaviour lists.""The Commandments are not bad rules in general, but Dr. Laura's blind faith in scripture (which was inspired by humans) is the sign of a mind that doesn't really study or think for itself."
3,Slightly Disappointed...,"Slightly disappointed, yes...but that doesn't mean that this isn't a really nice LOTR helm. I guess there was no hope it'd be as cool as the Witch King's that I own...but the real trouble here, I think, is that it's the ""Mouth of Sauron"" -- and without the mouth, as cool as the helm might be, it's just not as cool as I wanted it to be. Still, I'm glad I've got it, and if you're a collector of these, or if you like the character -- how could you not want one?"
4,miranda wilbanks,"I thought this book is awesome a very entertaining! I kept interested in the events and the plot. A sumary of the book is about a boy, Shawn, with crebral pralsie and he thinks his father is trying to kill him. He trys to figure out if his father really wants to ""end his pain"". Shawn knows that if his father doea try to kill him his brother and sister will do their best to try and protect him. I would rate this book a 4 out of 5 stars because it catches your attention and keeps you interested."
3,It was interesting,"While I didn't hate this film, I didn't really love it either. It had an interesting plot, although sometimes it seemed hard to follow. I did think that Forrest Whitaker and Julia Stiles did good work in this film, but for some reason the plot never really got off the ground and the final resolution just defied belief and not just because of where Whitaker's character ended up. The wrap up was definately NOT in line with the psychological make up of the husband. He would not have done that. No how. No way. It wasn't in him. And Abe (Whitaker) - Maybe think of something unusual like, oh I don't know, how about calling the police when it involves a police matter. Despite the flaws though, I thought it was pretty well acted and a pretty interesting piece of work. This was not one of the best films I have ever seen, but if you like kind of off-beat, atmospheric movies this might be to your taste. Definately worth a try if you have a hard time picking out a rental"
4,A Little Trip to Heaven DVD,"This is a somewhat unusual and very interesting crime drama film. Forest Whitaker, Jeremy Renner, and Julia Stiles are very fine. The widescreen picture is of high quality and enhanced for 16:9 TVs."
2,boring with no excitement,i watched this movie and was scratching my head then wondered when something was going to happen to get my attention...never happened...the movie is boring and kinda dumb...i should have saved my money..
3,"Unique Atmosphere, But Ending Hurts It","This was an intriguing, although not satisfying,, movie and one I still felt was worth my few bucks I paid to rent it.It was filmed in Iceland - one of the few films I've heard of with that locale - but the story in the film takes place somewhere in Midwestern America. I knew that going in, so it made it kind of strange to view, in that respect. However, the story seemed very realistic. In parts, it almost felt like a documentary, it was so real and atmospheric.However, as much as I enjoyed the movie, and particularly Forest Whitaker with his odd accent, the ending was a big disappointment. The film had so much promise up until then. With a more satisfying ending, I would have bought the DVD and watched it several more timesSome people say this film had the feel of a Coen Brothers movie, and I agree with that. To some, this might also have been a bit slow or boring but I thought it had unique atmosphere to it."
3,"BABY, IT'S COLD OUTSIDE","2005. Written and directed by Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur. Forest Whitaker is convinced that Julia Stiles and her husband try to cheat the insurance company he's working for. Kormákur who directed a few years ago the interesting101 Reykjavík, is in his element in the morose Minnesota. Not bad."
4,A little bit complicated,"I had a little trouble in elucidating this story, but was drawn in despite this. I found myself backing up a few times to try and sort out who was related to whom and how. Insurance agent Abe Holt (played by the talented Forest Whitaker) is an ace in finding a way to get out of paying death benefits and other insurance claims. Has he met his match when a sinister young man makes a car crash look like an accident? Abe is suspicious, but he's the only one in town who thinks the burnt body isn't Calvin, or that the wreck was staged. Uncovering the facts may get Abe in deeper than he'd ever intended. This is a good thriller that is a challenge to figure out.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
2,Not satisfied,"This CD was not useful... It is more of a review handbook for someone who already knows a lot about Chinese medicine... It is also difficult to understand for someone who doesnt know a lot about it... It also had no interesting features, no pics or links.... BORING AND NOT USEFUL"
5,A Wonderful Book,"This is such a great novel. It is full of familial history, human relationships, love, sacrifice, and adventure. I found myself propelled by the story and by the desire to see the curse ""come right."" This was my first experience reading a book by Bujold, but it won't be the last."
4,Enjoyable character-driven fantasy,"I'm already a fan of Bujold's science fiction Vorkosigan series, though it's a little pulpy. This is the first fantasy novel of hers that I've read, and I found the writing and story a cut above the aforementioned books. The characters are interesting and the protagonist, a now crippled and humbled former nobleman soldier with his best years seemingly behind him, is somewhat atypical. Unlike many other fantasy writers, Bujold focuses on intrigue and relationships over swordplay and sorcery, though the plot's not without the latter. She also develops a tasteful but interesting theology.While the story gets a little conventional in places, I enjoyed my time in Chalion's world. As for the audiobook experience, I thought the narrator sounded a little slow and medicated at first, but once I got used to his voice, it was fine."
3,Entertaining,"This is a surprisingly good fantasy novel. Many aspects are not original. The plot is another retelling of the Grail legend with the wounded monarch, the corresponding cursed land, and rescue by a virtuous knight. The quasi-Medieval setting, inspired by pre-Reconquest Spain, is also not original. What places this novel above the average is Bujold's craftmanship. She is a good and careful writer who creates likeable characters. While the ideas of this book are not original, she had devoted considerable care to creating her fictional world and its inhabitants. For example, there is some medical detail in this book. While not described perfectly, Bujold made a real effort to get the facts straight. This kind of detail will be lost on the great majority of readers but indicates the careful way she approaches her work."
2,"Strong in places, weak in others","For all that some Bujold fans swear by her prose and dialogue, I found it spotty in places, enjoyable in others. The style is very much the same as her SF novels, which is fine except that occasionally it is jarring in a fantasy setting. Perhaps the exeptional praise I saw here elevated my expectations to the point where it was going to be hard not to be disappointed. There a seceral really enjoyable scenes and some really witty exchanges, but I a;so found some parts tedious and a little on the amateurish side. In my opinion, Bujold is a much better writer of futuristic fiction that of medieval style fantasy. I await her return to the Vorkosigan saga."
2,Slow moving,"Not really a book for true fantasy fans: no magic, no swords, no enchantment. Plenty of court intrigue if that interests you but the book made me yearn for classic fantasy."
2,Miles in sheepish clothing,"LMB does reluctant heroes well. Certainly Miles V. is one of the better ones in the SF genre. But it's getting old.Despite ""reader"" reviews that sound like they were written by the advertising department of the publisher, I can't say this knocked me off my feet. I mean, it was enjoyable, but again, it annoyed me to see a standard set of Bujold characters reclothed and set forth into another genre. Is SF not profitable enough? It's sad to see authors diversifying without love for the writing, as if the books they produce are part of stock portfolios.This is certainly a readable book, if you don't mind seeing Miles in another form. I hope that LMB will seek to expand her repertoire of characterization in the inevitable sequels."
5,Another Really Terrific Book from Lois McMaster Bujold!,"I am so glad I found this book! Once I got over the shock of having Bujold write about a hero who wasn't Miles (or Cordelia), I loved ""The Curse of Chalion,"" an intelligently-written, fun, intricate fantasy, with a wonderful, scarred, angst-filled hero, wonderful characters, an interesting world, elaborate politics and a very, very fine plot. This is an excellent read."
1,Kindle price more than paperback?,This review has nothing to do with the book/story itself just that the pricing is more for Kindle than Paperback. I will not be buying the book because of this.
3,Shattered Hopes,"Although interesting and unusual, The Curse of Chalion does not match up to Bujold's Vorkosigan seris. The new character, Cazaril, is not in the same universe with Miles Vorkosigan; but I was hoping for another miracle."
4,"A good read, worth your time =)","I think I could give this book 5 stars if I hadn't read so many other fantasy books already. The medieval European setting is *so* done. As is the prophecy of the gods which moves the characters along. Ditto with court politics and loutish villains.With that said, let me tell you why it deserves to be read and gets the rest of my stars. Cazaril. Rather than fall into another old cliche by making this the protagonist's coming-of-age story, Lois told this tale from the point of view of the mentor. Thirty-five, world-weary, and battling injuries, he makes a far more convincing hero than you find in most fantasy novels. Whether it's scifi or fantasy, Lois does beautifully human characters so well. Interest in what's going to happen to them never fails to keep me up reading into the wee hours.Do check out this book. And then go read all the Vorkosigan books as well; even if you don't like scifi (I don't in general)."
5,Excellent,the only thing wrong with this book is that it wasnt long enough/isnt a series. It was a fabulous read and the characters were very real >> i wish i could forget it so i could read it again!
5,Miles Bettered!,"Stunningly good - I just reread this again, and it only gets better. Bujold seems to be getting bored with Miles Vorkosigan, but this is a glorious work she has poured her heart into. It is fantasy with integrity, and I can't wait to see more from her in this vein."
5,Wonderful read!,"This is a great read--fully fleshed out characters, interesting situations, well-developed world and society! Makes you want to be there . . . ."
3,Just OK for me,"This book was alright, but not something I would really recommend unless you've run out of better fantasy books to read. The plot is good, with some interesting twists. The characters are likewise enjoyable. Nothing that really grabs you and keeps you wanting to stay up all night reading. The ending seems like a cheap, tidy conclusion to me. I will be skipping the additional novels that take place in the same world - it just wasn't great for me."
4,"Good, Enjoyable Book","This is a good, enjoyable book. It's not riveting, or anything like that. But, it's pleasing to read. The only problems I have with it are minor. First, the physical condition/ability of the main character varies drastically from page to page. At one point, he'll be barely able to climb some stairs. Yet, shortly thereafter he's able to win a fight. Riding a horse practically knocks him out, yet later he can travel cross country at break-neck speed. Disconcerting, but minor. Second, the main female character is too sober and competent for her age. Fairly early in the book, Bujold shows how she's still a youth and needs tempering and education. Yet, within a year of the main character starting to teach her, she's better, smarter, faster, etc. than 99% of the people around her. Nice, but not very realistic. Finally, I could have done without the Spring/Autumn romance. Still, overall the book was very enjoyable."
4,Solid,"In many ways, this book is a departure from standard fantasy fare. All of the tropes are there (swords, castles, kingdoms in peril, magic), and yet this reads as much like a serious exploration of 16th century court conspiracies as it does a rip-roaring fantasy adventure. Although perhaps a bit slower than optimal and although its protagonist comes across as a little *too* self-effacing at times, there's really not much to complain about here. The plot is well thought out, the language precise, the pacing appropriate, and the detail exquisite."
4,Growing on me,"This book's been growing on me since I first read it, and I keep finding little snippets of ideas, characterizations, and plot twists sifting up into consciousness, to delight and amaze. I'll be rereading this one for years to come."
5,A jewel of a book,"This story is a wonderful fantasy which takes several chapters to really get going. It's necessary to lay a lot of ground work before the story can really pick up. Once it starts, it's very difficult to put down.I found that I was holding my breath for the first few chapters, waiting for something Really Nasty to happen, but the nastiness didn't appear until later, when you're better prepared for it.It has nothing to do with the Vorkosigan universe at all. This is not science fiction. It's also not High Fantasy. No fairies or elves or hobbits (or wizards or Ents or...) here. What is here is very sufficient and is quite worth your time, in my opinion."
3,"A lot going for it, but...","This book was well written and had a very well developed, fascinating culture and belief system. Cazaril was an intruguing character. But, by the end I was struggling to finish it. I thought the ending was pretty predictable, and overall the book was perhaps a bit too short on action and excitement."
1,Very unhappy with it,"I bought this from my local RV store. I had to use teflon tape on both fittings to keep from leaking and I cannot easily unscrew it to drain the water, which was the whole idea I purchased it. I would have been just as well off with the original plastic fitting. Luckily I kept it."
4,Drain Valve,"Use to have to remove the plug each time we came home from travel, it was a pain before. This product makes draining the water heater an easy task, the wife can even help now!Arrived on time, good packaging. No complaints!"
1,Leaked,"Seemed like a good idea, but it leaked incessantly no matter how much I tightened even with Teflon tape on the threads. I returned it."
2,Exactly the part I needed - but it arrived slightly defective,"This valve is exactly what I needed to make draining the hot water tank in my RV a breeze. Unfortunately, it arrived with a quality control problem - the T-handle was not properly crimped onto the valve shaft. The first time I tried to use the valve, the handle came right off in my hand. Rather than fool aroung with the nuisance of returning it, I reworked the crimp with a hammer & punch. I was able to make it secure enough that I can use the valve without the handle coming loose. Hopefully, it will not work loose & be lost due to vibrations on the road."
3,Recommend Tool,"There is a tool you can buy for this, recommend it. It must be tightened tightly to prevent water leakage. Little difficult to do with a standard set of tools."
2,Don't waste you money,Don't waste you money on this item! It would take two days to drain the water tank just take out the old plug when you drain the water tank.
3,Poor Picture Quality,"I purchased one of these but I returned it. It was small and a very neat camera. It did all the things it was supposed to do, but the picture quality was not very good. I did not expect it to be great, but it was not even as good as the quality I get with my Digital camera (that has a limited video feature).Also, it only allowed two screen sizes for viewing and they were both small."
5,Great product,"I bought the flip to replace my Vivitar digital camera and my JVC VHS-C camcoder. The flip's picture quality is great, better than the VHS-C and better than the Vivitar. It also has better focus. I can take a picture 1 foot away and its still not blurry. The light sensitivity is fantastic. You can take video in a dark room and it comes out fine. With my Vivitar camera, I would always have to do post processing on the image to lighten it up.On the down side is zoom, its not worth much but then again I would not expect a camera of this size and price to have a zoom that competes with the JVC full size camera.Its so easy to operate and download videos that I use it alot more. With my other cameras it was always a matter of asking myself if I wanted the hassle for a picture of the moment or not - or the moment passed before I could get ready. I paid $99.00 for this at BestBuy."
5,Easy and fun,This is single handedly the baddest little camcorder out there.The resolution is good and when your done just plug directly in the computer for editing even comes with its own software built in...simply amazing...
4,Camcorder for Dummies!,"Great 'toy' for Christmas 2006! Santa delivered 3 at our house! Hopefully we can e-mail fun clips from house to house....however, I have yet to make that feature work for me.Quality of the takes are really great , as is the sound.Love our new 'toy' !"
4,Decent little point and shoot video camera,"For the price, it's hard to beat the convenience of this little gadget. Uploading videos to the Grouper web site is easy, operation of the camera is a snap. I have found it very handy for sharing holiday messages with family and friends, showing the guy at the hardware store why I'm having trouble hooking up my dryer exhaust hose, documenting new home purchases for insurance purposes, etc. Easy to drop files into iMovie. Image quality is fine for most everyday uses, but nothing fancy. The only big gripe I have with the unit is that when you click to zoom in or out, the click is majorly audible in the film. Otherwise, all technology should be this simple."
4,Great Value,This camcorder is fun and easy to use. I bought this one for a young teenager and the price is great so you don't worry about it being lost or stolen.
3,Fun but not excellent. 3 Plus Stars,"I think this is a cute camera but it isn't great. For one thing you can't edit your video on your computer, just play it off of it. You have to take it to get a dvd made.It takes fair to good pictures but remember to hold it the way the welcome screen comes on or your pictures will be upside down.Most digital cameras take better video than this, but this is cheap. So when I dropped it in the mud and it still worked, I didn't mind.For kids, for a fun vacation, for something where you don't need great video, this is a good buy. But if you need better quality, save your money and buy a digital or used video camera."
2,Don't expect 60 minutes,"Got this for a trip to send clips to friends as we traveled. Not a good idea unless you carry a laptop also. The video sharing program must install on the host computer. Not possible on hotel or internet cafe computers.Also expect only about 20-30 minutes use from the batteries.The most disappointing part was that it only held about 35 minutes of video and with no way to send them home we had to delete good clips to save what we hoped were better clips. The manual says that if your clips are ""complex"" then it won't hold 60 minutes. Maybe they think you're going to shoot video of white walls.It takes 30 seconds to turn on so don't expect to get those fast candid shots."
2,"Good idea, bad execution.","This item seems too good to be true, and it is. The resolution is awful on anything other that the built-in monitor. The USB hookup is short and rigid. It won't line up with the port on my macbook, and it hangs from the back of my imac. Something flexible would make a lot more sense for versatility and be less fragile. The shape is also completely non-ergonomic.You'd think by the reviews that this was a miracle machine. Maybe I'm less motivated to rate it highly as it was a gift. Be warned, it's useful only if you dig watching video on a <2 inch monitor. I'd return it if it weren't a gift."
5,Fun Fun Fun!!,"I bought this on a lark, it just seemed like such fun and though I bought it back in Dec, I finally really used it today at a wedding, and I was shocked! It took great video inside the church where my (low end) digital camera could not. I wasn't sure how the video would actually turn out, but it was GREAT considering by the time things were done I paid $[...] for it. The built in software is wonderful (though i wish I could download it to the computer) and I made a ""movie mix"" of the wedding with the camcorders software and how fun is that! Shoot, for the $[...] if all I got was the wedding video it was worth it. I really couldn't believe how clear the video was with this little ""toy!"" I don't understand any negative reviews, it's cheap, it's fun and it does a heck of a lot for [...] bucks. Pure Digital Inc. has a $[...] rebate on their website. Buy it, use it, have fun!"
4,Great Video at a Low Price,"I've owned the Point & Shoot camcorder for three months and simply love it. It's so small you never think twice about taking it along. The camcorder is very easy to use...only 4 buttons plus 2 to control the zoom. You can download the videos with the pop out USB connection and the e-mail utility makes sharing your movies a snap. It even comes with a soft pouch so it doesn't get scratched up in your pocket.Most important, the video quality is very good! All in all a great item."
5,Best Gift Money I Spent This Year,"Several years ago, our son began asking for the ""Spiderman Video Camera"", and he was given one that Christmas. The day after, we returned it for a full refund because it was so awful. He still asked constantly for one and this Point and Shoot came up in my 'Gold Box' on Amazon. I bit my tongue and bought it. It was the best purchase I made this year, and we have 5 kids! I only wish that bigger, higher pixel video cams were this easy. This thing is fantastic. If you want something simple, good quaiity and HANDY, this beats all I've ever seen. Even the sound recording is good. I'm waiting for a 60 minute one to turn up in my 'Gold Box' so I can get one for we grown-ups to use. If it broke today, we would have gotten our moneys worth. Computer/TV hookup is a breeze. Emailing video clips is a breeze. You gotta love it."
3,What is that zoom sound?,"I love the ease of use of this little camcorder. But is there something wrong with mine or do they all have that loud zoom sound upon playback? So when I use the zoom (in or out) while recording, the sound of the zoom upon playback dominates. So much so, I don't want to use the zoom at all while recording."
5,Top notch,This is the most terrific little camera you will find............and what a bargain. It can fit into your purse or pocket. The instructions consist of one little folded piece of paper. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure it out. The editing choices are amazing. I can't say enough good things about it and now it is even cheaper than when I bought it!!
4,Point-and-Shoot,"First of all one of the biggest reasons I bought this camcorder is because it says it works with Macintosh. Well this is very true but they do not mention that you need Quicktime 7.0 or later to play your movies.This means you must be running a newer version of Mac OS X (i believe later than at least 10.3) to download this Quicktime version. I was able to find a work around by using a Media playthat played AVI movies, but er the quility was not as good and the sound was delayed and echoed.Eventually I was able to find a converter that changed the AVI format to a Quicktime movie format and it worked great. It was a bit time consuming, but considering the cost of the camcorder and the quality of the pictures I would defenitly recommend this for you!**update** it still works awesome even after an accidental trip through the washer and dryer"
3,"Cheap & easy, but lots of pixelation and poor in low light","This thing is incredibly easy to use and very cheap. I would recommend it for people who don't mind poor image and sound quality. The 640x480 images are very, very pixelated, with occaisional bursts of extreme pixelation/noise, and the sound is as bad as it gets. The low light abilities and poor contrast make the camera virtually useless for stage performances. My daughter's face was nothing more than a big white blob on the video for the entire play. Our old analog tape camcorder would have produced a MUCH better image. So I can't recommend it for your kid's concerts/plays.The device works best outdoors or under brightly lit conditions, and is great for a kid to use."
4,I enjoyed this product,I have to say I was suprised how easily operated this camcorder was.Normaly theres something I don't understand. Although there's one thing I don't like.For me the camara uses a lot batteries it should come with a charger. But over all I think it's a good and easily used product.
4,Brilliant,I bought the point and shoot video cam to capture some family moments and possibly do some funky stuff on youtube. So far we've used it as a family and it's great. Really simple. I haven't tied to load anything onto the internet with it yet but I'd be surprised if it's a problem. I'm going to film some uk property (as I'm an estate agent). To catch the footage go to [...]
2,Pure Camcorder,"It's easy to use but I wasn't aware that it wouldn't run on WinME until I tried. Also haven't been able to run the videos on any TV I have. I have taken the camera to CVS Pharmacy, the only place that burns them to DVD and they don't know how to do it without help from me. The cost is $12.99 plus tax for one video. Also the video doesn't match the audio. Compact size, ease of use and clear pictures are the positives."
4,easy to use,"Point, action and shot! Easy to download and save. However, it does not allow easy editing - that you got to get a sophisticated editor's program. For a low cost camera, the images are pretty clear and the sound quality is o.k."
3,Outstanding service on an exchange by Amazon.com!,"The first point-and-shoot camcorder we received was defective. We lost lost a good portion of the video from our vacation and could not download the remaining video to our computer. Obviously, we were very disappointed and completed Amazon's return from to exchange this camcorder for a new one. I was very impressed how quickly Amazon.com responded to our return and sent us a new camcorder before they even could have received the unit we were returning! Outstanding customer service by Amazon.com!!!!The new camcorder we received works fine. It is very lightweight, small and easy to use so it enables you to bring it and capture video you might otherwise miss. Video quality and sound are good for such a small and inexpensive video recorder. The buttons are a little to small, but functional."
4,Works as advertised,"This is a nifty little unit that functions exactly as billed. It might be considered a ""fast food"" version of a camcorder. The video quality is acceptable -- MPEG4 resolution which is roughly equivalent to VHS. But where it shines is the simple user interface. If you want to capture a moment quickly, you can be shooting within 20 seconds. And you can email a brief 20 second clip in 90 seconds after shooting it (assuming your computer is in the same room!). The controls are simple, with nothing to set, and it's much simpler than trying to shoot video with your digital still camera. You can use Nero 6.6 or 7 to burn your videos to a DVD or a VCD. The zoom lens is digital, not optical, so there is a noticeable decrease in quality when you use it. And the little built in microphone doesn't have much range. But given the price, this gizmo can't be beat. I loved mine so much, I bought 2 more as birthday gifts for friends."
5,Simple is Better,"The Pure Digital Point and Shoot digital camcorder is the easiest camera I've used since the old days of Kodak box cameras. Results are excellent and the camera is virtually foolproof. Even my wife, who is technologically challenged, has made excellent vidoes with this compact jewel. We are looking forward to using it on an Alaska cruise in September. The only drawback, so far, is the warning not to use rechargeable batteries. It seems the same AA batteries I use in my digital still camera should function just as well in this camcorder. I would also like to be able to insert a larger capacity chip for more than 30 minutes recording time."
4,simplicity at its finest.,I have trouble taking pictures and videos in parts of my house due to low lighting. i had no problem with this camera even at night. the camera is sooooo easy to use. it comes with wonderful video software. the picture quailty is great and the sound it perfect. my only complaint is the battery life. if you play back videos on the camcorder be ready to replacing 2 double A batterys with each use.
5,Awesome Little Camcorder,"I ordered this camcorder for my 8 year old daughter and we both love it! It's so easy to use (even for someone like me who's electronically challenenged!). You can easily plug it into the TV to watch the video back or save the file to your computer. My dad is an engineer and he even ordered one after he saw it to use on his job sites. He has to look at sites then go back to the office and write up a proposal so it's perfect for him to put in his pocket, video, then play back to make sure he remembers everything. Excellent little camcorder for the price!"
3,If it didn't have a virus it would rate a 5,"The camera seems to work as advertised. For the price, the picture quality is excellent. Autofocus and brightness auto-adjustment does an excellent job. The only problem I had with it was that the program that it had installed on its internal memory which was supposed to let me view my videos on a computer contained a virus and the Puredigital technologies website (not to be confused with a similar one for PureDigital of the UK which seems to apply only to small radios) was pretty useless in getting me a replacement for that program. There is no mention of the PSV-351 anywhere on their website that I could find. I still haven't located a replacement and the 888 tech support number only works from US locations."
4,Great little recorder,"I would give this a 5 star had I not had a problem initially. At first I tested it before giving it to my girlfriends 9 yr. old son. I did a 7 minute video and later noticed that when deleting, it only showed 23 rather than the 30 minutes as it should have.I had great customer service though. Pure Video offered to send me a new unit overnight at no cost. Before it got here I was sent instruction on how to clear the memory which worked perfectly. I therefore did not accept the new recorder which arrived the next day.There have been no additional problems in the month it has been in use since."
4,A good buy,"This digital camcorder is a good buy. It is simple to use (if you have smaller fingers than I do) and has a good clear picture, of course depending on the operator. The only problem I have is getting the right tilt in sunlight in order to see the images on the screen when recording."
1,get a warranty,"The camera does a great job for those of us who just want to point and shoot. My only advice would be: get the extended warranty. It only has a 90 day warranty. Our camera failed at 120 days. It couldn't be repaired, and they said ""sorry, but that's how it is."" Imagine my surprise when a week later, their Customer Operations V.P. sent me a new one. That's good service, but I wouldn't count on that happening every time.Bottom line: I wish I bought the warranty, but it sure was nice of them to send a replacement that they weren't obligated to do."
1,Titan 23150,"I've had my Titan 23150 torque wrench for almost a year now. Probably used it all of 4 times. I was tightening some lug nuts on my wife's car the other evening and the directional lever popped off and it stopped clicking when the torque setting was reached. I now have an expensive breaker bar. I contacted Titan by filling out the form on their website and got no response. A call to the company no response either. Basically, the company does not support their product. Lesson learned."
4,I Want More,"I remember this remarkable Movie back in the 50's at the Cinerima Dome in New York.The presentation was astounding. The huge Cinerama screen and the great soundtrack gave me Goosebumps then, and even with the now dated recording ,you can still experience the grandure of this incredable documentry.I would like to beleive that a more modern Surround sound would be recorded.After listening to this recording the only things lacking is again the slightly restricted frequency of the soundtrack and the very short recording."
1,oh my.. i forgot about these guys,I have no cluie how equal vision could see that these guys have any potential. Madface singer is hilariously bad. Equal Vision should have signed On the Might of Princes when they could have... oh well.
5,Outstanding Product,"Perfectly engineered, ease of installation, fantastic looks, functionality, this product has it all.As installed on our Mitsibushi Outlander, this product truely is GREAT. It vastly improves the appearance of the vehicle, and is considered to be money well spent.The product exceeds all expectations.LLD"
3,"Good, but not the best, Eddie C., but dont forget Hip!","This is a strange CD because it is really a compilation of two artists, but it is not listed as such. The second half of the CD is by Hip Linchain, who, like Eddie C. Campbell, was a great West Side (of Chicago) blues guitarist in his own right.The Eddie C. Campbell material is good, but not Eddie's best. The band doesn't really click here -- they don't back up Eddie as well as they should, and the overall sound suffers. Nevertheless, Eddie's reverb-drenched guitar cuts through pretty well, and true fans will want this CD to complete their collection.The Hip Linkchain cuts are pretty good, also. He had a great, soulful, albeit rough voice, and his guitar work was excellent. If you've never heard him before, this might not be a bad place to start."
3,Disappointing,"I had hoped for more commentary. I already have a lectionary. This book basically is a lectionary with a tiny bit of commentary and little in the way of suggestions for discussion. A good Bible commentary is a better choice I think, even though it would not be in lectionary order."
5,a great boots,"It was like I expected. The height was perfect and the size also. Its easy to walk in and comfortable, but it doesn't bend that well. I really loved it and it deserve 5 stars."
3,Cute but small,"These boots are super cute. I actually purchased them for a Halloween costume. Because I have small feet and wide calves, I thought the lace-up feature would help. It does help, however the tongue is too small so it looks weird. I think they're my best option, so I'll take them to a shoe-repair place to have a wider tongue and longer laces put on. From what I could tell, they felt fairly comfortable in the foot though."
5,Awesome,"I got everything in time, in perfect condition. Thank you so much! I'll definitely be making more purchases in the future."
5,They're great!!!!!,"I got these yesterday and they're my favs among 6 pairs that are shorter or taller. The heels are 2"" TALLER than anything I've ever worn. I love them! When I showed them to my wife, she promised she'd make me wear them to our annual fetish ball. She would never wear heels this high, but she loves me in them! Thanks Amazon,I'll be back for more!"
3,This was an OK book,"The book Fly Like an Eagle is not very exciting and does not have any action, and that is what I like in a book. That is why I rated it a three. If the book had more action and more exciting parts, I would have liked it better. The book was not as bad as some books I have read but it was not great either. I like the book because he cheats on his girl friend while he is on his trip."
5,My favorite black dye,"I've been dying my hair various colors for years, using professional and home dyes, and this black really wins. Its permanent, so don't expect to strip it out of your hair easily. Its pretty much a 1B, if you're trying to color match with extensions, its perfect. Its a soft natural black and the coverage is fantastic.I have been unable to find this dye in stores recently, and I'm starting to worry that Clairol stopped making it.This isn't the best photo in the world, but this is the color not to long after application.[...]"
5,Kitchen Must Have,"Great versatile kitchen item. Every kitchen should have one! You can mix large recipes without making a mess, and it makes a great storage bowl. My kids all get one when they move out on their own."
2,WRONG COLOR,"I was sorely disappointed! I ordered a red mixing bowl to match my decor and I got a pukey green one instead, without an explanation as to why I got it. The dealer didn't even say she was substituting nor did the invoice indicate anything like that."
5,Thatsa some bowl!,"Great item. Loved the service and great info included.If you need an oversized bowl, this is THE one."
5,Christmas Present,Bought it for my Mom for Christmas she has one that is wore out and I couldn't find one anywhere until I found this one. I'm thrilled that I found one!!!!!!!!!
2,Kim A.,"I have enjoyed past large mixing bowls from Tupperware, but this one has a very poor seal on it, and thus vegetable salads don't keep well...I am quite disappointed in it and am trying to think of another way to keep my salads fresh. I would not recommend it."
1,Lid does not fit.,"We had one of these bowls last year, but destroyed it in a highly embarrasing oven accident. We ordered a new one and were surprised to discover that the lid does not actually fit on the bowl: it's too small. That's kinda the whole point of Tupperware, so it gets 1 star. We're shipping it back for a refund. There are now several recent reviews that all indicate this same problem - buyer beware."
1,no more of this stuff in my kitchen,"I used to love Tupperware. The last bowl I received was through a school fund raiser a few years back (24 cup bowl). The lid not fit and with it being fundraiser material, I did not return it. It is a real nice size for baking anyway. Well here I am several years later and I just bought this 32 cup big bowl, lo and behold, the lid does not fit!!! What were the odds!! Now I have to mail it back to amazon and I will never make another tupperware purchase again."
3,Poor format hides content.,"The entire book is a set of questions and answers, so while it may be useful for certain specific reference areas, it lacks in executive detail and depth- and is not readable cover to cover. As a third text on the topic, it is useful. Not to be too negative, there is a lot of good information tucked away in here."
1,"Ok, I dont understand... One 4"" Mold for $6?","So, I was all psyched to get my 4inch 10-Flute Brioche Mold. When I opened the bag, 1!I mean... shipping weight says 1 lb. Hmm. Who sells 1 tiny mold these days."
2,Ouch...,"I seriously think I could have created a better program with Microsoft Powerpoint and less 70's music...It was informing on Geom., yes, but dreadly poor at everything else...Save your money, buy a different program."
2,Beautiful but flawed...,"The bells are beautiful - I could listen to them all day. But this recording is seriously flawed in that the master of the bell choir can be frequently heard giving instructions to the bell choir, and he's really loud! This turns what should be an extraordinary recording into one which is marginal.I hope that this recording will be remade without the constant interruptions. The bells themselves are quite lovely."
3,could buy much cheaper at a store,the yarn is fine....but I am now tempted to go to Wall Mart to buy yarn from now on...and I hate Wall Mart...as it cost meat least 2 dollars more for one scane off the internet.
2,Way cheaper at Walmart,I only rated this 2 stars for the price. I just bought the same yarn. Same weight and length at Walmart for 2.77. That's half of the price they have it on here.
1,red heart super saver cherry cola,"I love this yarn, but the only place i can find it wants to charge me more than the cost of the item to ship it. AND they don't reduce the shipping price if you order more than 1. Boo-hiss. ONE STAR"
1,yarn,I hate how your site works. I want to see the colors of Red Heart Supersaver yarn--and no other kind. I get a few mixed in with pages of other stuff!
5,quick and easy,"It's what I needed. Couldn't find this product in any of the stores, so the higher prices were okay since this color couldn't be found around here."
2,faded,The yarn I received was very faded and dusty looking. I purchased it to continue a scarf I was making and you can see where the yarn meets.
4,Good Value,"Red Heart Super Saver yarn is a good value. It's cheap, durable and washes well. The downsides are that it's scratchy and can irritate your skin when you knit or crochet with it. The pull skeins often don't work or become very tangled towards the end.I've used this particular color (Turqua) in a few projects and love its bright hue."
2,NOT as shown,Color is a Bright Pumpkin Orange NOT golden yellow as shown. The color recieved is a nice orange for pumpkins and pumpkin hats so I did not return.
2,Knitting yarn,"This yarn is wonderful to work with and easy to maintain a good shape for the project I was working on. The only negative I have is tht the color that I recieved was not what I saw on the computer screen. The green was more of a split pea soup green and I had wanted a more mellow green. It did work for another gift I was making for another relative, so it worked out alright."
4,Better Than What Is Said,"I just wanted to take the time and explain to people what ""Solar Prestige A Gammon"" means. Elton and Bernie were fed up with critics dissecting their lyrics and all that stuff. So, they decided to write a song in some made up language that didn't make any sense at all just to tick them off. Got it?. I had to explain so people would stop saying Elton's material went downhill with that song. You gotta know what it meant before you ridicule."
5,Elton John's Fourth Real Rock & Roll Album Is Great,"CARIBOU, Elton John's fourth album as a real rock & roller (and his tenth overall, if you count the soundtrack to the film FRIENDS) is a great one. This is one of the most underrated Elton albums of all time, and anyone who claims it's not the equal of GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD should be institutionalized in a psychiatric facility's secure ward. I know I'm sounding a bit harsh, but I feel this way because this album was the first not to feature the hollow-sounding orchestral arrangements of Paul Buckmaster, who seemed to make real violins, violas, and cellos sound synthetic. Instead, we get the Tower Of Power Horns on many songs, which adds punch to both the rockers and the ballads. Any putdown of this CD is, in my view, a form of temper-tantrum."
3,"A failed attempt to continue the successful ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road""","When a Rock superstar launches a Mega-hit album like ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" (as a double LP, in addition) what to do next?... Quite difficult! With ""Caribou"", EJ tried to keep his lucky star in the heights of success. However, the album falls short to be the logical sequel to his previous masterpiece. Anyway, it is an album worth to give a try. ""The Bitch Is Back"", ""Pinky"" and ""Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me"" are genuine EJ superhits. But ""Solar Prestige A Gammon"", as well as ""You're So Static"" and even ""Stinker"", are an exercise on a different EJ. Strange songs, but hey, if you expect to listen the same tam-tam-tam and tah-dah/tah-dah/tah-dah on every record you get from your favorite artist..."
3,A Fun Album---Not A Masterpiece,"Elton John was at the height of his poularity during this period. Having just released the phenominal Goodybye Yellow Brick Road less than a year earlier, this follow up pales by comparison. Yeah, there are some WONDERFUL songs on Caribou. Bitch Is Back, Don't Let The Sun..., Pinky, and Ticking come to mind.That said, there is some filler on this album. Songs like Dixie Lilly and Solar Prestige A Gammon actually make me cringe--and I love just about everything E.J. has put out.Elton John was a hit making machine in 1974 when this album was released and he prooves his stamina with this effort. Still, if you're unfamiliar with Elton's music and want to purchase some of his 1970's best, there are better options--like Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Madman Across The Water, Honky Chateau, or even Rock of The Westies. In my opinion, all of those would make a better choice than Caribou. His latest, Captian and the Kid and Made In England are also worth a serious listen."
5,Badly Underatted,"This is an often overlooked CD. Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me and The energetic The Bitch Is Back are more commercial hits but the other tracks are very touching. Pinky has some beautiful chords and Ticking is an emotional masterpiece. The additional of Pinball Wizzard and Step Into Christmas only elevates this work. Pick it up soon, you will not be dissappointed."
3,"Elton stumbles, trips and falls","Coming hot on the heels of Elton's masterpiece, ""GoodBye Yellow Brick Road"", ""Caribou"" was a crushing disappointment to critics and fans alike. Elton had never been one to put out ""product"" for the sake of satisfying the demands of the record company execs, but that's exactly what this is. There are no golden eggs here, although there are a few rotten ones, namely ""You're So Static"" and ""Solar Prestige A Gammon"". ""I've Seen The Saucers"", ""Stinker"" and ""Ticking"" are the exception and each would sound right at home on ""GoodBye Yellow Brick Road"". Many of the other tracks are filler. Considering the pressure Elton was under and the hectic touring schedule he endured, this sin of an album is understandable but falls well short of the high standards Elton had set for himself with his string of early 70's gems. Sadly it was all downhill from here...."
4,ok elton john cd,"This was the first EJ item I bought as a teen. I had enjoyed the radio play of Dont let the sun go down on me and The bitch is back. Other songs that I found that I thought were good were Ive seen the saucers and ticking. The worst track is Solar prestige a Gammon. Dumb. The others are enjoyable but not great. I went on to find the other albums and would agree with another reviewer that this is a weak album in comparison to Goodbye Yellow brick road, Captain Fantastic and some of the others but overall it was still an enjoyable 45 minutes of music.I dont have the remastered version but the addition of Lucy in the sky and Philadelphia Freedom would make this a decent buy"
3,I KNEW I should have skipped this one!,"Well, what can I tell you guys? This album is THE worst from his golden years (Empty Sky til Blue Moves). I don't think Elton John was taking his career seriously at all, and it all sounds so refried with several exceptions. ""The Bitch is Back"", ""Ticking"", ""Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me"" are the only reasons for buying THIS album. I remember someone telling me ""Crocodile Rock"" is the silliest song Elton has ever done. They didn't here ""Solar Prestige A Gammon"". What is that? I think Elton John was going through a ""Let me do an album like the Beatles"" stage. I really don't like this one, I had a bad feeling about it from the beginning, and it only goes to show. Doesn't compare to classics like ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" or ""Captain Fantastic""... just doesn't."
5,I DON'T CARE!,"I don't care if it was a rushed album. I don't care what the critics think about it! In my opinion this album was better than 2low4zero which I see has a 5 star rating. From ""The *** is Back"" to ""Your So Static"" you find a great selection of ""fun"" songs! Who cares about the lyrics to ""Solar Prestige a gammon""! He never claimed to be a philosipher(sp?). The song was written for fun and should be accepted that way. If you listen to the first six songs with that understanding, you'll find yourself in the same ""fun mood"" Elton was in when he recorded them!The only ""stinker"" on this album was aptly titled. But even his greatest album, ""Goodbye Yellow brick Road"" had ""Jamaica Jerk-Off"" and ""Social Disease""."
4,Low Key Elton,"After the bombastic Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Caribou makes no attempt to match the previous album's power. Instead, Elton makes a very low key album symbolized by the ballad ""Pinky."" Perhaps influenced by the cold winterland where it was recorded, Elton makes an album here that seems like it was designed to be listened to in front of a roaring fireplace, with a glass of wine or two. Fans that expected more ""Benny And The Jets"" were undoubtedly disppointed, but fans of Tumbleweed Connection and Madman Across The Water can find a lot to listen to here."
3,not only the beach boys....................,people seem to forget how in tune to music and other artists that elton was. not only are the beach boys on backing vocals but the TOWER OF POWER horn section did all the brass back ups; elton even took them out on his tour with him to support this album.i rate this album a 3 only because in 1974 and living in FORT LAUDERDALE; radio station WSHE would play SICK CITY over an over from SUN single before the album was released. man i was upset when the album came out and SICK CITY was not on the album. all in all this album still holds up well.
4,Another Hit By Elton,"I bought the Caribou album when it first came out and now that I don't have anything to play my vinyl on, I buy CDs. This CD by Elton is the same great music it was when it was first released. If you love Elton, you'll love Caribou."
3,EJ - OK,"This is an okay album by Elton John, not great, but some nice music on it. Does not challenge Honky Chateau or Goodbye YBR."
3,CONTAINS ONE OF HIS BEST EVER PERFORMANCES,"This album is not worth five stars. Those who've made it so should have another listen to 'Solar Prestige' and reassess. Even Elton and Bernie have indicated this song was made-up trash.Elsewhere, Elton displays his deep affection for the music of The United States, including some of the less celebrated genres. The LP suffers only because it seems casual and offhand, coming as it did towards the end of Elton's dream run, and some of the greatest albums of the Seventies.The real jewel in the crown here is 'Ticking'. It's compelling from start to finish, and it's as raw as Elton ever got. It's an incredible performance, and leaves the listener with an altogether different vibe than if the album finished with 'Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me', which would've been the predictable choice.It's still an essential album-- but then I'd say ALL of his Seventies albums are, although 'Victim Of Love' ends the decade on a low."
2,Could have just released a single of the 2 great songs,"The only reason to buy this CD is for ""I've seen the saucers"" and ""Dont let the sun go down on me""....in my personal opinion...the only 2 songs worth listening to.....This album was a complete flop...compared to the epic GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD and everything that preceeded it.....I think the falling out between Elton and Bernie contributed to its failure......Elton is a great musician and performer but his song writing ability leaves alot to be desired."
1,doesn't work,"It didn't work at all. In fact, if you were to ask me, it made the puffiness under my eyes even worse."
3,A fun and funny book,"This book is science fiction for kids 5th grade or below.The 'next generation' Mac lap-top with holographic images and speech recognitions as an outer space ""Server"" with teleportation iskind of fun. The American friend as being a complete self-serveris really kind of Republican funny.I don't think I would buy this for kids I know as it would insult them?The book is more like a bad sci fi cartoon on TV, than what I would like to see. And this book is just number one in a series!"
5,If I could only give more than 5 stars.....,"...I'd give it a 10!This (the first release from Estradasphere) has got to be one of my all time favorites. The album opens with the 20 min. opus 'Hunger Strike', a song which spans over most all ranges ov musical styles(including, but not limited to: Death metal, gypsy, classical, rock, pop.....etc.)and it's all here waiting for you to listen. Go see Estradasphere live and see the spectical for yourself (. . .) Keep the disease alive!!"
4,Most excellent!,Great underappreciated band of honest to goodness musicians makes astounding debut album and rocks out live... hear all about it... NOW! DO IT!
4,Cool,"I went to school with a few of these guys. Didn't know them very well, but they were basically cool. And extremely talented. I'm glad to see they're going places... representing UCSC! This album is mainly musician's music, but speaking as a musician I'm duly impressed. Definitely worth checking out."
4,An easy reading,"This book is very easy going for a beginner. It summarizes the essential teachings of sufism, particularly the Naqshbandi tariqa. Based on a set of questions and their answers, this book educates a novice to the teachings of sufism. This book also gave a very brief historical setting of how sufism, and in particular, Naqshbandi tariqa flourished. This is an excellent mentor reading on the soft mystic side of Islam."
4,"Disturbing, haunting look at drug use.","This is a photo journal and brief description of poor families in a Brooklynn suburb and their plight against the world around them. It focuses on single women raising their children while maintaining their drug habits, and point out the battle of breaking loose from the norm around you. Not matter how much was written in each description of each family, I would probably still hunger for more, but this is only a brief glimple into their lives. The photos, while disturbing, were outstanding. Glad I purchased this book."
3,"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here","Moral equivalence near-ruins an otherwise fascinating book. Beginning with Adrian LeBlanc's rambling foreword, various hosannas are sung in the name of the ghetto and the 'complicated common humanity' of its various inhabitants. Residents for whom the crack pipe is forever lit, with no qualms whatsoever regarding the moral fitness of using one's crack addict customer as a babysitter. No doubt Keannelly and LeBlanc would find Newt Gingrich infinitely more culpable.We see drug dealing as a family enterprise, various people's addictions, neglected semi-feral children and their street-weary mothers devising ever more ways to deceive CPS. Keannelly, to her credit, captures it all with honesty."
2,Fascinating but Frustrating,"As someone who's interested in the Amazon, its people, culture, geography, fauna, flora and other subjects, I read this book for its fascinating topic. However, this is a very mixed bag. There are moving sections, as when she describes the genocide perpetrated against the native peoples by Europeans (you would not believe the atrocities and torture they visited the Indians, whom they considered lower than animals - much worse in its ferocity than the Holocaust of WWII). The writing can be quite bad at times (at one point, her powers of description comes up with a fruit she tried, ""bitter as semen""). But the worse is, she seems to be a very bad science writer and researcher. Who edited this book? Certainly not people versed in science or Portuguese. She gets everything in Portuguese wrong. The scientific names and terms are often misspelled. Proceed with caution."
3,Good but could have been better...,As a huge fan of cetaceans and river dolphins in particular...I just had to get this book. It was full of interesting accounts about the dolphins and the Amazon...but at time the story moved a little slow...and at times the language got a tad flowery and a bit cliche....I'd read it again though if i had to do it over!
2,I couldn't agree more,David Marsland's review is right on the money. I couldn't say it better myself so I won't try. :)
4,"A dark alternative to ""Shakespeare in Love""","Lacks the tragic inevitability of ""Dead Man in Deptford"", but still a good read. Brilliant language, Elizabethan England nicely evoked, well-drawn characters, clever speculation to fill in the gaps in what we know of Shakespeare's life. A bit crazy, especially at first, but that's what you pay for with Burgess, right?"
3,Self-Indulgent,"This is nothing but self-indulgent tripe. Undoubtedly, Burgess is knowledgeable about Shakespeare but he is not respectful. Throughout the sloppy novel, he maligns the author without any historical basis. Without knowing anything about Burgess, I was inclined to believe that the novel might be largely autobiographical.If this is what you get from Burgess, I want no more."
1,Junk,"Single use scale. Once the initial battery in this scale dies, you cannot use the scale again. We bought replacement batteries, yet the scale does not work. It is a cheap, Chinese-made piece of junk. Do not waste your money on this cheap inferior product."
2,ouch,not sure if my shoes are not roomy enough but this thing hurts a lot! even in my running shoes that have extra toe room it not only hurts my bunion it also hurts the other toes as well. this seems counter to what it is suppose to be doing. Not a fan!
5,Feels like its not even there!,No problems wearing this i don't even notice that it is there ! Very soft easy to clean non irritating
4,Nice helpful source of information.,This is a nice-to have book. Covers a really wide field of subjects. Very helpful research tool. Good addition to your library.
3,Hilarious Album: Not as good as JB 3,"The Jerky Boys have hit their peak with the last album. This album seems to display a groping for creative material. The song at the end of the CD is rediculous beyond belief. There are some hilarious tracks, such as the track with ""Sammy Cox."" But I feel this is their last piece. Anymore CDs will probably feature outdated or unoriginal tracks. I recomend Jerky Boys 1-3."
4,EXCELLENT BAMBOO BOOK,"This is an excellent book on bamboo. It is detailed and thorough. It is ten times better than ""The Temperate Guide to Growing Bamboos"" by Bell, which is just an awful book on the subject. This book is the opposite. Worth every penny and will be a valuable resource for me throughout the years ahead. The author covers just about every aspect of growing bamboo, botony of bamboo and harvesting bamboo. It didn't get 5 stars because it lacks more study on container plants, but where it did lack it more than made up for it in other areas. A great book that is a must have. You should definitely buy this book. If you buy any book on bamboo, you should make this a definite buy. You won't regret it."
3,OK the last 100 pages are garbage,"When I started reading this novel I thought how perfect it was but as the pages wear on the main character begins to annoy you with his experience of every burden.There is nothing he has not seen or done in ""the real life that counts"". The last 50 pages of it are almost unbearable."
3,of human bondage,OK so its a classic. after reading it I'm glad it was free. it was long and boring there are a few parts worth reading but for the most part a yawner. Philip is stupid and lets a woman walk all over him again and again. He meets some great women but bypass's them for the user. He doesn't realize how good he has it until he wastes all his money on that woman and is left destitute and having to work in a job fit for the lower class.(English class system at its best during the time the book was set in) The only redeeming part of the book is he learns a lesson and in the end make the right choice using the head on his shoulders and not the other one.Of Human Bondage
2,Careys Clubfoot,"I am under the understanding that Philip's clubfoot and his issues with it are merely an allegory for homosexuality. Somerset was homosexual and the emotions that Philip expresses throughout the novel are autobiographical. Taken in that context, the novel is an interesting ""self-discovery"" piece. The non-sexual Mildred and his utter disinterest in the voluptuous young girl at the end further this theory."
4,Trapped,"After reading the preview on the back of the book ""Of Human Bondage"", I was hooked. It spoke of a young man who would answer to the beck and call of his woman even after she used, tormented, and abused him. I wondered what type of man he was. Was he sympathetic and caring or weak with no self-control? The book kept me on my toes. As each new woman was introduced, I asked, ""Is she the heartless one?"" Throughout the novel, the main character, Philip, is searching for his position in life. I think people are able to relate to Philip because most readeres have struggled with difficult choices at one time or another. At times, I did not agree with the choices he made, but in the end, it all worked out for te best. Because the reader can see into Philip's thoughts, it clears up some questions about why he thinks the way he does. Overall, I believe W. Somerset Maugham wrote an excellent novel. It portrays a real human being who feels and acts in the same manner that most of us do."
5,Of Human Bondage,"Loved it! Maugham loves to write of obsessive love. The reader spends their time in an era long gone except that Maugham brings it to us delicately on an old fashioned silver platter. It's a long story, relax and enjoy it."
5,An Absorbing Work of Art,"Maugham's classic tale of a boy's coming of age and earlyadulthood is a masterpiece. Philip, the protagonist, isportrayed with empathy and realism. Philip's doomed infatuation with Mildred, the centerpiece of the book, is completely absorbing. Maugham's treatment of the nature of love and attraction is fascinating and provides much food for thought. This book haunted me -- I felt totally involved in Philip's obsession and despair. The book's resolution is satisfying and uplifting. This is a sensitive and unforgettable book."
3,Interesting,"Although this books was hard to read at times because of the era in which it took place, it was overall, worthwhile. Some of the characters were aggravating probably due to their Victorian way of looking at things. Still it was an interesting look at how society was in those days. A few punctuations of unexpected hilarious humor made the book much more palatable."
3,of human bondage,wanted to re-read this because its a classic but....... feel silly commenting on somerset maugham but it is soooo wordy and very slow going in some areas.. really think it could have been just as moving with far less words
4,I am glad I stuck with this book.,"The first 50% of this book was slow and hard to get into. I have reading rules, however, so I stuck with it and I am really glad I did. I LOVED the second half. There are many kinds of human bondage. Philip experienced life in Europe in the early 1800's with a club foot. He lost both his parents when he was very young. He was tortured by unrequited love. He experienced life in many realms of social class including becoming homeless and destitute. He had a moral conscience although he debated giving in many times he remained true to what is right. Great ending. In all, a very satisfying read."
4,Of Human Bondage As Book And Movie,"Of Human Bondage was first published in 1915 and that version of the book is much longer than the abridged edition that was approved by the author. I suspect that this might explain some of Philip's sudden revelations and insights. I just finished reading an old Pocket Books paperback edition with a ""new"" introduction by Somerset Maugham in which he explained his motivations for writing this book, I found this to be very interesting.This was a reread for me after many decades on the shelf, I felt it compelling then and I still feel the same.If you enjoy classic cinema, please view the 1934 movie ""Of Human Bondage"" with Bette Davis as Mildred in one of her best performances and Leslie Howard as Philip, an unforgetable movie."
5,Amazing powers of observation,"Maugham is the quintessential writer-observer. His style may seem detached and rather unemotional, but that actually works to his adavantage. Maugham lets us make our own conclusions and allows us to construct Philip's emotions as we would experience them. That's what makes this book so special: there are so many times that you feel like Philip because for every reader Philip is largely their own creation and not an artificial construct foisted on you by the author. If you like literature to be subtle and yet have the power to transport, this one is for you!"
4,Well rendered,"Though italicized words and all diacritical (accent) marks are omitted, this is a faithfully rendered text (in careful reading I noticed no typos). Recommended."
4,Classic Coming of Age Story,This book took me forever to read however in the end I can do nothing but rave about it. It is long which means that the reader truly become acquainted with the main character; and gains a full understanding of the use of the title. I am not sure why this novel is not more well known. I enjoyed each growth spurt of the main character as he learned new things about himself.
2,Stopped reading 150 or so pages in,"Some people really love this book, I found it tedious without a clear plot or relatable protagonist. That being said, I wouldn't continue reading it so perhaps it picks up and gets really awesome."
4,One of my favorite books,"W Somerset Maugham shows great insight into the makeup of humankind. As a prolific reader, i've related to hundreds of characters in novels, seldom have i found a character like the protagonist here, Philip Carey, who reminded me of myself. I have never read a fictional book and discovered more about myself in the process, except for Of Human Bondage."
3,I can't wait!,"My friend, a fellow fan of bondage works, has told me this is a true classic of the genre. Coincidentally, she was born in Somerset. The volume only arrived yesterday, but I'm looking forward already to a good read. In anticipation, I'm only giving this three stars, as I feel the publishers could have done something more appropriate for the cover."
2,ho hum,"Describing this book as clearly written is more accurate than declaring it as profound or deeply probing. It's quite an easy read and that is not a mark against it; the lucidity made me not mind reading a book which was honestly not very engaging. I thought Philip petty and he floats through his life as blown by a wind from orthodox Christianity, to Parisian art, to a ""respectable"" profession, finally settling down with a woman he does not love for a life which is far from the searching adventurousness which he once fancied all with the stoic spirit of, if it gets to hard, I'll just commit suicide. The disengaged lightness of tone in Razor's Edge works much better than an aimless wondering through writing a novel. I did not find this book inspiring (but it wasn't bad either)."
3,Disappointing,"Maugham is an excellent writer. However, unlike other reviewers, I was totally unable to identify with the protaganist. Phillip's euphoria at having discovered such a thin and shallow meaning for existence at the end of the novel was entirely unbelievable for me. His pain was real. His passion was real. But I cannot accept that his contentment at the end of the book was real. Regret has a purpose. Life has a purpose. Morality has a purpose. Those who would explain away life's challenges by writing them off as quirks of nature . . . I find it very difficult to believe that they achieve any lasting peace. I was upset with the novel, because I think that what was real (Phillip's emotion and experience) was turned into a lie by Maugham's interpretation of that experience in the final pages."
2,"Very difficult, depressing, hard to read...","I know, I know, everyone speaks of what a classic this book is. And I must admit, when my book club decided to read this book I was initially pleased, as I really liked Razor's Edge. But of all ten of us in the club, only one finished the book!I got as far as page 394, so I really did try. But I kept wanting to give Philip a shake, tell him to ""get over it"" and get on with his life already. Mildred was a perfect pill, and I was quite annoyed with how she abused his faith and love. The other characters were, for the most part, either one-dimensional, or unlikeable.I know I'll most likely get slammed for daring to say this, but I just didn't like this book, and I was not the only one. It was just too depressing and full of despair. Avoid this unless you like a hard slog through the muck of sadness."
2,A tad disappointing,This started okay and was interesting when the boy was growing up. It tapered off when he went overseas and started mixing with people of different nationalities so much so that the book is yet to be finished.
3,Talk about hopeless!,"Love as many of us has experienced it. But when you thought it was bad, you see how low we can stoop. This was a good book for those interested in relationships."
3,A Slow Go,"I kept thinking this book was going to get better, and I put it down several times. It wasn't until page 300 with the entrance of Mildred that things improved. While I enjoyed Maugham's style at times, this book was just too long and wordy. An interesting plot with the story of Philip, an orphan with a club foot who must live with his uncle when his mother dies. Philip goes on to boarding school where he is mistreated and then tries to ""find himself."" He makes friends, works at a law firm, attempts to become a painter, and finally settles on medical school. He makes some poor choices along the way with his finances and with his lovers. Overall, this book was a disappointment for me, and I probably won't read Maugham again."
4,Don't get discouraged...,"The beggining to the middle of this book is actually quite dull, but the middle to the end is excellent reading. Shocking secrets, situations, make it well worth it. Despite what others have commented, I found it quite easy to read, and usually couldn't put it down. The time when Phillip (protagonist) is in dire poverty is probably the best part of the book."
4,A bit dry...,"The entire book has a plethera of amazing and interesting information, yet, the information is presented in a little bit of a dry way... but hey... it's a textbook, what can you expect?"
3,okay,"This book is fine. I should like to point out, however, at the risk of belaboring the bleedingly obvious (as comedian John Cleese might put it), that a book true to its title called ""A History of Western Music"" is necessarily concerned with the past, and the past tends not to change. The past is pretty much content to stay put. (On the other hand, the number of graduate students in ""musicology"" keeps increasing, and if these students want eventually to find positions they have to publish papers. Having found positions, if they want to secure tenure, they have to publish more papers. To accommodate them there exist paper receptacles called ""journals"". The past is pretty much impervious to the contents of these paper receptacles.)"
2,the publishers rake it in on this,"The book, though a fine book, is simply overpriced. The book is used primarily for students who are music majors. It is a very good marketing ploy for the publishers to rip the students off with this material. A student could probably buy a cheap car for the price of this book. As far as the content goes, it is extremely detailed and often difficult to follow. In short, this book is not worth the pruchase. As a student I would simply go to the library and check it out and pay the $1.50 overdue fine."
4,The standard by which other music historians must follow.,"This is agreeably the most popular and complete text for any serious student of music history. It is straightforward, concise, and without unnecessary embelishments other authors may find necessary. This straightforward writing style, I must admit, does not make it the most exciting text available. When I was in undergraduate school, I found that Grout's book was often the most effective cure for insomnia."
4,"It's the standard, but one can still wish for something new.","Grout and Palisca are the Microsoft of music history. Over the years the book has been refined again and again to the point where the whole thing does what it does very well, has what an a very large number of people need, and is acceptably easy to use. On top of all that, it's been backed up with extraordinary marketing savvy. The result is that right now it has little serious competition. Which doesn't stop me from wishing there were a history of music that had flair, had a strong individual perspective, had a new way of looking at the world--none of which you'll find here."
2,I bought the wrong book,This book wasn't what I thought but the teacher showed the right edition and it was okay. Understanding the underlying meaning is hard when you haven't heard it much/\.
5,History of Western Music,"I used this book when I studied music forty-five years ago. I was not a music major but I learned so much about the source of what has become modern music. How can you fully appreciate the sounds you listen to today if you have no idea of the origin of your music style. While contemporary writers trace trendy music from one music generation to the next; to truly understand why you like what you like you must go back to the origins of the sounds. When I finished the course my favorite period was the Baroque. If you have not listened to J.S. Bach, then you have no idea why you enjoy today's contemporary fads. We owe a debt of thanks to Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, and their predecesors for laying the ground work for today's enjoyment."
5,"Totally Cool, Clean, Clear Uno Cards","These cards are made of durable plastic. They look great, feel great, are waterproof, and washable. No more dirty cards or snack residue! Just wash them off."
4,Yay uno!,"I think these are the best Uno cards you can buy. :] They look very nice, but if you bend them, there will be white ""scar"" marks left on there... So WARNING! don't bend the cards!I don't really like the case that it comes in though, it opens easily and VERY VERY hard to find if you lose it in the beach water!Also, I suggest buying the cards from Walmart! I got them for only [..]Saved me the shipping costs too ;]"
5,Really fun for Rhett and Link Fans,I really enjoyed watching this film. I watch Good Mythical Morning and am a big fan of Rhett and Link. If you are not a big fan you may or may not enjoy this film.
5,Get Hype,Get Hype! Where yo' curly mustache at? Mango Sentinel reminds me of the New York Nicks! F' the Nicks! awoo
5,"For the beginner, the curious and the teacher","This is a very practical book for those just starting to use the contemporary healing method of homeopathy. As well it will be welcomed by lay homeopathic study groups around the English speaking world. Instructional. Well Organized. Ready to teach you how. Once you know you want to learn how, this is the best place to start your study."
1,"Homeopathic Methodology: Repertory, Case Taking and Case Analysis",Tnis book may be of help to a practicing Homeopath. It is useless for someone trying to learn homeopathic basics and trying to self-prescribe. I would not recommend this book.
4,good country CD,"""Future Full & Free"" is a great country CD, with songs accessible & well-written as the best Nashville CDs, while being more sincere and ""real"" than most ""high gloss"" NashVegas productions. You can almost hear the Rocky Mountains and the Colorado countryside in the music. Full of hooks you can't get out of your head, and enduring (but not cliche) sentiments about family, country and life, it's easy to listen to over and over. It could become the musical equivalent of your favorite pair of jeans."
5,Love it,"I received this set as a Christmas present and I love it. It's very lightweight, but sturdy. The cups have a great feel in your hand and are a good size. I've been looking for a dish set with some pattern, but not too much, and this is it. Nice choice of colors and pattern. Neutral, but with a little kick. The bowls come with plastic lids for easy storage. A nice little perk. I'm tired of all the oversize plates that seem to be out there, so to me, these are just perfect. Not too big or too small. I highly recommend this set and plan to buy more myself."
5,This beautiful book captures the feel of living in Hawaii,"A truly stunning book. I lived in Hawaii for 15 years, and Reed's paintings evoke some of my best memories. This is the Hawaii that tourists rarely see: the vistas of the Pali cliffs that you see on a hike along a little-known trail; the sleepy rural settings illuminated with the light of early morning. While thumbing through this book I could feel the soft, fragrant air, and remember laguid days of exploration.Reed's landscapes have a strong emotional undertone that goes beyond his skillful representation of real scenes.Buy this book for a wonderful mid-winter trip to paradise!"
5,A Day In the Life of an Alzheimer Patient,"This book has been so helpful in assisting me in communicating with my mother. I have also shared this book with the activity's director at the nusing home. The other residence of the home get so much pleasure in the interaction of sharing this lap book with the staff. As far as the illustrations are concerned they bring much joy and many smiles to the faces of the other patients. The drawings are child like, but so are the minds of an alzheimer patient. This book has allowed me to share in my mothers feelings on a verbal and pictorial level.I thank you Lydia for writing this book, as it has opened up many topics of conversation with my mother that I was not able to bring out of her previously. I look forward to your next book.Sincerely,Sherri Hauptly"
1,Don't Recommend It,"It is so simplified and child like, an intelligent memory challenged adult might be offended or hurt. My 92 year old grandmother didn't see any value to the books contents."
3,Not that great.,Not enough to read aloud. Too many questions in the back of the book agitated my mother. Nice idea but doesn't quite work. Suggest which stage of dementia (memory challenge) this is appropriate for.
3,Good Attempt to help people with dementia,I like the book - but couldn't keep my mother attentive - I think the type is too small - maybe a little busy to look at - The writing is good!! I appreciate anyone that publishes books or anything to help - - Thank you!
5,Excellent Reference Book,"Ruckman's References is an excellent reference book for many salient verses in the Bible. He does throw in a few of his wacky ideas, but it's packed with Scripture on many of the most important verses showing the doctrinal content and also briefly puts in proper context verses used by Catholics, Pentecostals, Calvinists, and all the other heretics and apostates. Also gives light on some ADVANCED REVELATIONS!! It's great for Bible reference, but nothing beats what God Himself shows you in HIS PRECIOUS WORD OF GOD, THE BLESSED KING JAMES BIBLE!! THE ONE AND THE ONLY!!"
4,i agree the frist two stories are great..,omg... very well written an stories draw you in... didn't feel like i watsed my time or my money but the last story had an horrible h... she was just a bad person... i couldn't even feel sorry for her even when i found out about her past...really like this authors books
1,How did this ever get published? .,"This is the worst book I have ever read and I read 5 a week. Definately do not waste your time or money. It is actually so bad, I refuse to look at any other books written by these authors, or Avon Red Publishing."
1,Buyer Beware,"Beware! although the information on the sale site clearly states that the product is great for campfires when I received the popper there was a large type sticker on the box stating ""For Decoration Only - Not For Actual Use"".I will be returning this item."
3,I wasn't impressed,"Reading the other reviews I thought this would be a great book but I honestly wasn't impressed. The writing is skillful and beautifully descriptive but I found the plot to be disappointing. It's true that the moral is clear - I really appreciated how the aunt emphasized the importance of having a positive attitude and making the best out of a poor situation. But that they had been intentionally lied to by the light house keeper really bothered me. Someone will probably come along and say that's the whole point of the story, and maybe it is, but that ruined the book for me. It is great that the aunt and nephew overcame that, but somehow it left me with the impression that I was supposed to empathize with the lighthouse keeper - that his needs were more important than theirs. It just wasn't satisfying. There's no excuse for lying to people to get your own needs met, even if other people learn from your error."
3,"Classic, but...","I realize this book is a classic, but I and my son found it rather boring and sorta... pointless??? I know I'm probably in the minority here, but it's just not a book I'm going to keep and read to each of my children as they grow. There are too many glorious, wondrous stories about Christmas for me to give this one a stellar review."
5,Cockatiel seed,"I bought this seed for my two female cockatiels, who have been on a different (and more expensive) seed for the past 6 years. I LOVE this mix - it is affordable, clean and doesn't have any of the issues I find with most seed mixes (I don't like things ""fortified"" with sprayed on vitamins, or artificial coloring added). The birds seem to like it, and I liked that it wasn't dusty like a lot of seed mixes. Will definitely be ordering again."
5,Really neat!,Really nice looking. Got it as a Christmas gift for my son-in-law. Can hardly wait for him to open it.
4,Beautiful plates,"These beautiful plates have a delicate pattern and look really quite pretty. They go with theMikasa Parchment 40-Piece Dinnerware Setwhich is very affordably priced. While above it says both that they are and aren't dishwasher safe, I do believe they are (we've put them in the dishwasher and nothing has happened to them).They make a beautiful addition to the set, but unfortunately 2 serving dishes sometimes isn't sufficient for a meal when we have family/friends visiting, so if you plan on serving multiple dishes, you might want to look into buying additional serving pieces.The dishes were packaged well, and it is easy to put the dishes back into the original box for storage."
4,Good overview of uses for smocking,"If you are a beginning smocker looking for instructions and patterns, this is not the book for you. BUT if you are an experienced smocker looking for new applications and help in adapting patterns to insert smocking, this book is very good. Many innovative ideas for adding smocking to you sewing. Nice photos of projects."
2,Not Worth the Money,"Save your money for something more useful. There is nothing in this book that makes it worth the price. A far better book on bear market investing is ""Riding the Bear"" by Sy Harding. And for concepts about timing the market and investing both long and short, see Les Masonson's ""All About Market Timing"" and Deborah Wair's ""Timing the Market."""
2,Disappointing,"If you're looking for specific methods for trading or investing you'll be disappointed. Most of his advice reads like a collection of conventional investing wisdom, with his own bent. It's almost like a theory of investing and he doesn't give specific techniques or examples. More ""Look to do this or that"". Much of it is vague. Lists over 20 indicators to look at, suggestions on what to look for, but there are no examples or charts. It reads like a general overview of his investing philisophy or a primer. You won't come away with any new techniques. The main theme is don't buy and hold, there are times to go short and look at the big picture.He does touch on cycle theory and Elliot wave briefly. He list many sentiment and breadth indicators to look at or calculate. Some can be gotten through data services, others you have to calculate by hand from data from sources like Barrons. I was expecting a lot more from someone with his reputation. There was no solid material here."
5,Bear Market Investing,"The book was very straight forward and very interesting,. I have found alot of the information was true."
3,Vonnegut for a Vonnegut reader,"This collection is probably most interesting to those who are arleady Vonnegut fans. It doesn't really even pretend to contend with the writer's greater works. I think that, perhaps, this book is most helpful to those who already know Vonnegut's body of work, and simply wish to understand more about the author himself. ""Wampeter's, Foma, and Granfalloons"" basically consists of Vonnegut's public speeches, as well as various essays. The book can help a reader, already familiar with Vonnegut, understand more about the writer, and the ideas behind his novels. However, I would recomend that a first time reader pick up one of Vonegut's actual novels (Slaughter House five and Mother Night are higly recomended) before looking at this. I would recomend this book to an avid Vonegut reader/fan."
1,wrong book cover,"when the picture appeared to be this one, i assumed that is what I would be getting. It was a gift for a friend because i lost hers so it had to be the same cover as in the picture. However, it wasn't and now i have wasted my money on your product and have to buy another one from someone else."
4,Good collection,"I've just finished reading the entire Vonnegut collection - this was the last one, and it was a fitting finish. I feel this collection gives the best insight into KV as a person out of all his autobiographical collages (though this one isn't entirely autobiographical). While his other collections show his history, this one gives you some insight into how he thinks and feels. I especially liked the final piece - an interview from Playboy, he's very bitter and opinionated, yet openly vulnerable in it."
4,Yet Another Great One,"Once again Kurt has succeded in pouring out his heart, to readers and msking us fall in love with his books. There is no reason why this is so great, it just is so read the damn book. you'll be glad you did."
3,Amusing---but that may be all.,"I do not own this series but have rented the first few episodes. The animation is fairly dated, as is the poor English dubbing. The story line, while mostly interesting and usually equipted with a good degree of humor, is fairly hackneyed and predictable. It follows the adventures of a young, thoroughly moronic girl who gets attacked by monsters and often falls bottom-side-up so that the audience can see which pair of underpants she is wearing that day. I enjoyed renting this series but would never buy it as I would probably only watch it once."
4,a whole new world :),"I love the idea of transforming human conciousness. It's all new to me, but also sounds very profound and real."
2,Ok if you are mentally ILL,"All i have to say is 'sick'. If you think death is a good form of entertainment, try this out. If not, dont waste your time and money. I came accross it when a friends friend was watching it and i couldnt stand being in the same room where it was playing."
4,Faces of Death is one funny feature,"I thought the fake death scenes were the funniest things I've seen in ages (especially the guy being gassed). Most of the footage was made up for the documentary, but to try and give it credit they mix in some actual slaughter house footage. The series uses more genuin footage as it goes along, the latest one being a compilation of all the real footage. Try Traces of Death or Death Scenes for more of the same but with less faked footage. The Verdict: Definately worth a watch, but bear in mind that 99% is fake."
1,The most dissapointing FOD as of yet ...,"I personally think that this FOD, FOD II, was the most disapointing FOD as of yet, even Dr. Francis B. Gross thought of this FOD to be the more dissapointing before dying after his more of a much deadlier comback Faces Of Death film in the III'rd release. The only thing about FOD II I did not like was that it barely has real good footage of the study of death, more of in good words than good footage"
1,faces of death 2,now to me the faces of death films are just class up to faces of death 3 then the fake stuff cums out. this one is the best of all of the faces of death cuz its all real the guys at then end geting shot is a good one.and the stunt car and the boxing clip are cool 2. i think the men and woman who slag the faces of death who havnt seen it just heard about it are wrong thay shud sit down with a lager and some crisps and watch the faces of death 1 and 2 and thay may get what its all about good stuff i give it 5 stars cool cool cooool.
2,A Sleeper ?,"I saw this one on VHS many moons ago. A good friend of mine rented this one. He and I, and his wife, sat down for a bit of entertainment on a quiet friday night. I had seen the first F.O.D. That one was OK, it killed some time. This one must have been out-takes from the first one. I could hardly keep my eyes open. My friends wife took a nap about half way through the tape. Need I say more ? Don't waste you time and money on this ""Sleeper"".Watch the first one again. Trust me."
2,Faces of Death II,"Just watched the movie. Wasn't as impressed with the movie as I thought that I would be. Some of the scenes that they show, really are not any worse then you see on the evening news. Somewhat amateau in the editing of the film. One scene was repeated in the movie. Not sure what the point was in that. Wouldn't really recommend the movie, but perhaps the first one is better. If your interested in seeing what all the hype is about, go ahead and get the movie, preferably a used copy."
2,Not too good,"Good seller, fast shipping as far as movie it was not so great not nearly as good as I thought it would be. As a true gorehound, was not impressed with this movie."
2,Worst of em all,"Avoid part two of the quadrilogy, the first is a classic and three and four are pretty good too. The second video that is what they call the worst of the films isnt put together good. There are so many better death scenes than what they put in there. Stick with part one or four."
5,"Death will do us part. Terrific, isn't it !!.","OK, so some scenes are made in the studio. But if your a Faces of Death fanatic, this is a great sequel to the original. Rememeber, the fake scenes are to show us that this type of death does exist. So dont knock it. In fact , that reminds me, I need to place my order for Faces of Death III !.I just love this deathly saga!!. Until we meet again, here, or in the hereafter!!. C-ya."
4,Good for understanding your car,"This book is great for those wanting a basic understanding of cars in general and how to maintain them. A great starting point for those like me who don't know a lot about working on cars but are willing to learn the basics. The book covers a lot of thing that are good to know such as how to identify different fluids in the car (along with what to look for to see if there are signs of something wrong in them), what to look for to tell when belts need to be replaced (along with way to get rid of belt sqeak), along with some of the ""simpler"" repairs such as hoses, lighting, and spark plugs. It's best as a starter, and then a companion to something like a Chilton manual for your specific car. For example, this book talks about the PCV valve, but I had no idea where it actually was on my own car until the Chilton manual showed me a photo diagram of the engine I actually had."
5,"Great Watch, They Should Charge More For It!","Excellent product, met all my expectations and some. Great looking watch, gives watches that are far more expensive a heavy run for their money.Highly recommended product, I would certainly buy it again!"
5,A very beautiful watch...,"Do you want an elegant watch? A watch that can be worn with anything, Titanium made and really beautiful... this is how I would describe my new Calibre 2100. It came fully discharged but in about 2 hours it will be fully charged under sun light and ready to be worn! The ""official"" picture is not as good as it looks in real life, check the customers-uploaded pictures, they are more realistic and give a better glimpse of it."
4,Pretty good,"Everything is marvelous about this watch, accepts the alarm. They say that it is accurate within five minutes, but I find it more close to 15 minutes off my intended time. Also, shop around. If you can wait a couple of days you can get it for around $300. Less than the $450 I paid for it on sale. Anyhow, the titanium is really nice because it makes the otherwise bulky, heavy watch much lighter than stainless steel. But, whatever... it's a watch."
5,Almost the perfect watch!,"I recently received this watch as a gift (after dropping heavy hints and admiring it for >12 months). The other reviews have covered all the specific features so I'll no reiterate. I give this watch 5 starts - it really is that good. I've received a number of compliments (in the short time I've owned it). It's a large watch but when wearing it you don't really notice because it's so light given the Titanium construction (which looks great and should be hardy enough to look good for many years to come). The only reason I titled this review ""Almost the perfect watch"" is because of the absence of a perpetual calendar and the sapphire crystal (both minor - hence still 5 stars), with those 2 features I would classify this as the perfect watch - Great job Citizen!"
5,"WOW ,WHAT A BEAUTIFUL WATCH","I just recieved this Citizen beauty, And I must say that I""m blown away by its Awesome Design and the fact its so well madethis is my Second ECO I have the Diver Version which is AwesomeThis will make a Beautiful Every day watch, As well as a great dress watch...........Amazons Price on this Item is the Best on the Internet......If your Thinking of buying this watch and getting away from watch batteries forever, You will be making a very wise choice, Enjoy.........."
4,Nice and Light watch,"I just purchased this watch today. Picked it up for $420 (441 w/tax) from Kay's. Cheaper than Amazon. Its much lighter than the stainless steel version like a quarter of the weight. It has a brushed steel look and isn't shiny like the AV0031 models. It has a nice bulky look, although the glass should have been sapphire instead of mineral.Citizen should have made the date in line with 3 pm insead of 4:30. Thats my only problem with the watch. I would recommend the lighter version over the cheaper flashier stainless steel one. Its a $75 difference."
2,Not so durable,"Had watch for one week before one of the reflectors separated from above the 2 dial. Returned product for a full refund. It is a shame. A very nice watch otherwise. But for $450, I don't want to have to worry about my watch breaking."
1,Variations on a theme wasted by apathy,"Ignoring some of the crass racial undertones, I was hoping to be impressed, and for Barnhart to redeem himself here. However the book doesn't demonstrate any improvements on the original story and there isn't anything really substantive in the first book other than the promise of an emerging author finding his voice. This effort just felt like something quickly put together, stuffed in an envelope and then sent to the publisher. The series' potential is wasted by laziness and apathy. I think the book holds up well enough as a sequel to the first, but sadly that isn't granting it a whole lot. Camp fiction fans might like this in the same way they to watch bad horror movies on cable. Serious horror fans, who are attuned to the intricacies of Anne Rice et al will be as receptive to this as one is to pofessional wrestling or tractor pulls."
1,A small one,"This book is awfully trash, the first is readble but this one stinks, the main caracter sucks, he's not a man but a type of Rambo, or better an antizombie conan and rest...the rest are simply the rest...the end is horrible, i will pray to god for this trash never seen the light on film."
2,Case study on which writing mistakes not to make,"This book is useful for creative writing students in determining what sort of pitfalls in plot development, characterization, and mechanics to avoid. I'm judging this based on subjective elements that make a novel worthwhile to me; my viewpoint apparently doesn't apply to everyone, given some good reviews I've read about this work. I'd consider any work that gets published as a ""draft"" an ambiguous blessing to its author: on the one hand, it's a milestone, on the other, the remaining bodies of a writer's work will be judged on the first impression. Genre books will always find an audience, and this book (and its companion novels) fall solidly within that category. This story is engaging and works well but needs serious revisions to the aforementioned elements to be considered ""good""."
1,Zombies,"This book had a lot wrong with it. It's like reading some nonesense that people post on their web pages for fun or something. Everything about it insulted my intelligence. I didn't read the first book but, even so, I don't think it would have enhanced my enjoyment of this one. As horror fiction and zombie fiction go, I've read some pretty bad books in the past, but this one ranks at the bottom of the pile in my opinion."
4,"If you love the genre, you'll like this book.","Mr. Barnhart's writing has improved considerably with this sequel to ""Reign of the Dead"". I really like that Barnhart sets his stories in the world created by George Romero; many fans of Romero's Dead trilogy think it would make for a great television series (one that would air on HBO or Showtime with all it's horror and gore intact), and Barnhart's stories fit nicely into that kind of presentation. It's Romero's apocalypse, but here are the stories of some of the other survivors, in different parts of the country. A fun read."
5,Excellent!!,"This was an excellent book so was the sequel and can't wait for the 3rd book to come out. I could not put this book down, it took me 2 days to finish reading and then I read it again. Being a zombie movie fan (The original Dawn of the Dead, is my favorite), when I read this book it reminded me of all of George Romero's movies From Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead to even now Land of the Dead. Of course, Len Bernhart is a Fan of George Romero, its like a tribute to him. I definitely recommed this book to anyone who is a true zombie fan."
1,"As a book, it's bad","As a doorstop, it's okay, except for when it rains.Okay, I compared ""Reign of the Dead"" to a badly crafted ghost story told by an 11 year old (subtext implied). Apocalypse End is more akin to a wad of bubble gum that you notice on your shoe AFTER you've tread on the carpet. It starts out assuming that you already know what's going on (so, yeah, it's a sequel, but most sequels are written well enough that people can infer what happened in the previous book even if they haven't read it). Then, it turns into some kind of Rocky Horror Picture Show meets Night of the Living Dead knockoff pile of last Thanksgiving's dinner that the dog ate.One of my friends thought it would be fun to try to read this aloud at a party. Lucky for us, we had plenty to drink beforehand and I think he made halfway through page 3 before he was booed to silence."
1,I thought this was supposed to explain,"But it adds to the confusion. Also, there was a promise of an explanation for the zombies but now one must wait for another book to find out the beginning. I also think that the new characters needed to curse more and sound natural, it's as though the writing was censored. Also, I think there was some hint that the zombies ran fast and were smart but they weren't supposed to in this one, either -- maybe they will be in the next one but I don't want that, I like the slow kind when I read -- I don't even like thinking about fast or smart zombies. I don't think it's worth trying to get involved with this series."
1,Bad sequel to a great book,"I loved, I mean, LOVED Reign of the Dead. It was non stop action, suspense, and suspended reality. I felt like I was living that book as I was reading it. I don't know what happened with Apocalypse. I was expecting more of the same, but instead of a Romero style zombie story, it got really complicated and started to remind me of that movie The Postman more than a horror book."
2,"""Style"" over content","This book is a romping good time. It brings some fun and exciting flashes of zombie fighting goodness. However, this work is written as if it were a movie preview. The reader is shown fast-cut ""flashes"" of description, with virtually no characterization. There are major plot holes, and the editing is nonexistent.I love a good genre novel,but the clumsy delivery makes the book seemed rushed.This being said I will still buy the third installment when it is published.""Never let continuity get in the way of a good story."".....Mike Baron"
1,Nothing really original or interesting here,"Even though I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, this book wasn't very good. The author's style got on my nerves and ruined any chance that this book was going to frighten me."
3,Very big box!,This box was much bigger then i thought. I read the reviews mentioning the size of it but didnt think anything of it. Well little did I know that the box really is BIG!
5,TERRIFIC!!,"This book was wonderfully full of romance, adventure and heartfelt emotions. Rafe was a complex character and I enjoyed reading about the two different worlds he lived in. Callie was a spitfire and she and Rafe were made for each other."
1,Lovely Tickles and Pickles.,"I read this book for an outside reading assingment. While I was reading each page, I began to question my sexuality.I am male, staight, and my parents say that it's always good to explore new things, as long as they don't involve books.Well, now I know why! I should just listen to them.I wish I were a hawk sometimes and could fly away. I would have black wings and a red stocking cap. It would be so fun to look down at the houses and see trees from up high.My teacher said she loved this book, but wouldn't let me in on, as she put it, her little secret.I'm going to go eat an orange!"
3,Richard Gere,"I love Richard Gere and I didn't really remember this movie, I like it many years ago but my taste has changed lol"
3,One of those dated films that goes too far in my eyes,"Too profane . Too obscene . It's a shame too . I love Director Mike Figgis's LEAVING LAS VEGAS . This is a very compelling thriller that COULD have implied a lot more in my opinion . I saw it theatrically (INTERNAL AFFAIRS) when i was twenty seven in 1990 . I'm not a prude . Certainly i am a TCM guy . Perhaps it's , more than a bit , over the top ? It's as manipulative a film as sometimes comes down the pike . That's not necessarily a bad thing . I streamed it , so the cost was reasonable . Generally , i tend to forgive this kind of behavior and these sort of emotions and actions more in the horror genre . Are you the demographic ? Am i missing the point ? Is it ""exploitation"" ? Perhaps ? Judge for yourself ."
4,Good plot line. Intriguing. Exciting. Pure raw acting.,"It's pretty bomb. I liked it. It had a very good story. Gere and Garcia work off each other brilliantly. Murder, corruption, sex, greed, what more do you need?"
2,"First I liked it, now I think it's primitive","As a teenager I remember watching and loving movies such as this one, based on the wounded machismo of the ""good guy"" character (played by Andy Garcia here). The bad guy, in this case Richard Gere, challenges the good guy on several key areas of his macho identity: Who is the smartest, who is the best lover, who does the women prefer, is he stealing MY woman? And the predictable happens- all us stupid boys/men in the audience are drawn in as we identify with the ""good guy"".This is Internal Affairs in a nutshell. The plot is incredibly primitive, based on the macho competition between Garcia and Gere's characters. Nothing interesting happens, it's all totally predictable. If you want to prevent your brain from atrophy due to contamination, avoid this movie.As a teenager I enjoyed this movie, now I think it's primitive and boring."
3,Watchable film !,"Andy Garcia plays the role of the good guy who will face his corrupt partner who has manipulated so many people that he seems to be in peace with himself (Richard Gere) nevertheless he is obsessed for discover the old tricks and nasty behavior .There have been so many efficient and related films which has focused that theme that it becomes a real challenge to swim in these waters if you are not supported for a defiant script .That is the case of this one . The film is predictable for the endless common places .If you are really seeking for unbeatable films about that theme go for these five: Big heat , Serpico , Police Phyton 357 , Prince in the city and a terrific film of Henri Verneuili with Yves Montand (Icarus) ."
5,Informative and well illustrated,I bought this for my preschool student. He loved it. The illustrations were great and the information was simply stated. The text was presented in a visually appealing manner with additional text boxes for additional information. We read it often.
5,Hybrid/SACD Sound Suits Elton John!,"Hybrid/SACD's are the new wave in music, but unfortunately there are few great albums available in this format. This is one of them - one of Elton John's greatest achievements. I do not yet have an SACD player, but I do have a 5.1 DTS Surround Sound System and the results are fantastic. I compared this Hybrid to my regular CD version. The sound is crisper and definitely separated between the five speakers (not counting the subwoofer). The rear speakers accentuated guitars and synthesizers/keyboards I had never heard before. Sure, it's more expensive, but buy it and sell your old version on Amazon! This also sounds great on just a regular CD player. ""Funeral For A Friend"" sounds like a new recording in this format and the extra songs are a welcome addition. I can't wait until more CD's are re-released in this format."
4,Funny and Informative,"This TV show/DVD is a two in one deal: You get informed in the history of drinking customs in the particular area of the world he is in and the hilarity that comes along with drinking how the locals drink wherever he happens to be. I love this show and can't stop watching it, once I start!"
3,"I wish I really knew what it was like, but...","I never received the tonneau cover I ordered. I was shipped the wrong item (a bug deflector, not the tonneau cover I ordered) which I had to return, but was never contacted about getting the tonneau when the shipping error was realized - as was promised I would.I finally stopped waiting and purchased a Lund Genesis tonneau cover from truckaddons.com - and got a better product for a lower price.I gave it three stars because I've had an Extang tonneau in the past and liked it - which was why I ordered another one."
5,ear popping smorgasbord,"I came to this collection in search of the track ""Delirium"" by Euphoria, which, with its slick guitar work, is an innovative invitation to the rest of the album. While originally intent on finding more Asian electronica, this international collection has an amazing array of gems, ranging from the sultry ""Stay Human"" and ""So Nice (Summer Samba)"" to the perky ""Stiff Jazz"" and ""Bhangra Fever."" Karsh Kale's ""Milan"" rounds out the collection. By the end of the collection, I feel as though I have taken a trip around the world, sampling a wide assortment of music from the four corners. Music for mutliple moods will be found here. It's also a great introduction to new artists that you may not have come across before. Having heard this collection, I'm on the search for more by Euphoria, Wally Brill, and Karsh Kale. I would also really be interested in hearing more of the Six Degrees albums. This is a great testament to the quality of the work of the label."
4,Informative,"Great book when you want to know something quick and specific but don't need a lot of details. I like how it is divided into three sections - The Man, The Performer, and His Music. It's easy to find what you're looking for. This is the third copy of this book that I have purchased. I keep one at home, one at work, and gave one to my grandson. Very good reference book and highly recommended."
5,A pure classic....,"I thought I submitted a review for this but I guess it never published or the system has been updated. A Dan Aykroyd film is always chocked full of laughs from beginning to end and this classic is just that. If you're a new comer, you are in for the ride of your life!"
4,Doctor Detroit,"Have not seen this movie in years. We were thinking ""is it really as good as we remembered""? Not surprised YES! A must have in any comedy collection ... especially if you live in the Midwest!"
2,ACKROYD IS NO DOCTOR,"Dan Ackroyd's first starring vehicle after the success of the original ""Saturday Night Live"" is a weak disjointed comedy wherein he plays a college professor who must pose as a mob boss. The scenes with a rival crime czar, a woman named 'Mom', are grotesque and funny but Ackroyd never fits comfortably in the role as he did in hundreds of SNL skits."
2,I actually liked this?,I remember loving this movie when it came out. Just watched the DVD after not seeing it in 20 some odd years. What was I thinking? I actually liked this? It has it moments but unless you just want really bad 80's flashbacks...don't bother.
4,MPA STUDENT,"The book is a great resource for those unfamilliar to the realm of statistics. The author puts complex words and/or terms into easy to comprehend words.I would recomnd this book, if you have a deep fear of statistics."
4,Bernie the thief strikes again,"I love the Bernie series and enjoyed this effort, until the end. Too convuluted, too much just magically deduced by Bern without involving the reader in the discovery of the threads. The first two-thirds very enjoyable, getting to reacquaint myself with Bernie. I wanted to give it 3 1/2 stars."
3,Not the best in an otherwise brilliant series,"Not the best in the series, a little dated and a little racist. But it did introduce Carolyn and the bookstore (although it didn't show Bernie meeting Carolyn or acquiring the bookstore. That had already happened by the start of the book.) I wonder if the elusive Kipling book mentioned throughout is a real text. The Deliverance of Fort Bucklow. I must look that up.For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal."
1,A disappointing entry from a Class A author,"What a dissapointment this book was. Lawrence Block's Matther Scudder novels are some of the best I've read. I can only wonder what happened. Perhaps these were early entries into the literary world, but after reading one Burgler book I wouldn't go out of my way to pick up another. But he has enough other things out there...I'd give Block's other characters a read before turning off and tuning out."
5,AMAZING,This book is just about the most inspiring and amazing books I have ever read. The very first chapter completely forced me to look at how I view God and how it affects every part of my life. EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK.
1,What an unrealistic look at adoption,"Carp tells adopters exactly what they would like to hear: that adoption is a wonderful solution. However, as an adoptee, I can tell him that the ""flawed studies"" he chides tell the truth. People are hurt by adoption. Mothers have a bond with their children that transferring legal rights to raise the child cannot break. When a mother loses the right to raise her child, however, the child and mother suffer. The ""genetic bewilderment"" that Brodzinsky talks about, for instance, is something I experienced firsthand. Only after reading the term did I know how to articulate the pain I've always felt. Carp needs to talk to the adoptees I've met in my life, and to the mothers who've lost the rights to raise their children. I wonder what interest Carp has in promoting adoption."
1,He knows not of what he speaks,"The author obviously never spoke to any ""true mothers"" when writing this book. To say they ""there are too many psychologically healthy birth mothers and adopted persons to allow one to entertain seriously the idea that traditional adoption is inherently harmful to those involved."" is to show he has conducted no studies of his own on true mothers or adoptees in this country.One only has to read mail on any of the many adoption related email lists on the internet to see what trauma is caused by adoption.I rate this book a -10"
1,Poor historical method,"I am interested in the history of adoption so I read this book. The hard data from the earlier part of the book was compelling but the general conclusions drawn towards the end read like biased propaganda. Carp, privy to one state agency's top secret adoption files, makes sweeping generalizations validating across-the-board adoption practice for the nation based on his interpretations of this microcosm. Also, fairly deadly to read."
1,Another bad one.,"Claimed to take out Chlorine odor ... not! I bought a set of 2. Installed. ran the filter for 15 minutes or so. Tested the water. It taste terrible. Added some CL2 test powder. Loaded with residual chlorine. Good thing i didn't use it for my aquarium water change. Took it out a tossed it. Now still have a new one and couldn't even give it away. Lesson I learned. For stuff like this, don't order online. Not even worth the hassle of returning it. No. Not recommended."
4,bird seeds,"Since I can't afford bird seeds any longer, I fill this up with dead tree bark. Alot of the birds land near it then see that it's useless tree bark and they look mad. Later on, the birds start hanging around my window and they look very, very mad."
3,okay not great,"The problem with this feeder is that the adjustable perches keep moving when the birds land on them. Then the birds have a hard time landing when they are pushed in, I drilled a hole in the bottom base and put a screw in to keep the perches from moving."
4,"Fun, but the wings get annoying","My three year old son loves Toy Story, and is thrilled with his new Buzz Lightyear toy. He loves the retractable helmet, the pop-out wings, and the voice that sounds like the Buzz in the movie. My husband and I love that the voice isn't too loud, so it doesn't drive us crazy when he plays with it! The big problem with this toy, as others have mentioned, is the wings. It's too bad that the manufactorers couldn't have found a way to make the wings stay on without breaking. We are constantly replacing them for our son, who gets frustrated when they snap off. Overall, though, we're very please with the toy, and we're glad we have it."
3,To big for an action figure to clunky to be a doll....,"My daughter got this toy and was very excited. However there wasnt much she could with. she tried to cuddle with it but its plastic and uncomfortable, she tried to play with it but it was too big and cumbersome."
1,Not very effective,This is my first try at using HG weed. I don't know if it is this particular brand of the product or the weed itself but it isn't doing much for me at all.
2,nothing special,This product had no affect on me what so ever. I even took four caps. I took it for an entire week total waist of money. This is totally worthless unless your getting excited or something based off a placebo effect. I had no reduction as far as I could tell in my arthritis and nothing even close to what those people claimed about friskiness or anything like that. Blue Goo works better which is a lotion for pain relief. Anyways not recommended unless your fooled by taking pills.I can't put the star rating at one because I don't know how to prove arthritis reduction if I did or didn't have any reduction just know other methods work instantly.
2,Would have given 3 stars but it's suppose to be better than the show;,"it wasn't. It shows the startup and ending credits of every episode and even the JK spin in and out marker for every commerical. Happy I could fast forward. Could easily been much better, but still good if you like the show."
3,Some good material . . .,"A little too self-serving and preachy at times. Still, worth the read, if you know Mr. Miller and his brand of humor."
4,Ultimate Roadrunner,"This is not the first Jonathan compilation anybody should buy.But this one is a must, just because of a few items (mainly B-sides) that you won't find anywhere else. The best reason is the ultimate version of Roadrunner. It was already the best cruising song ever, but this live version is so good, that you will find yourself driving down the highway and you can feel the rhythm of the engine....."

5,Worthy of emulation,"In addition to being one of the 20th-century figures most worthy of emulation, Dorothy Day was a great writer with a distinctive voice. One of the best autobiographies I've read."
5,Very interesting. Keeps your interest. Also very informative about that time in history.,"I'm still reading it. Am enjoying it. I love autobiographies where people expose their most inner thoughts, fears, desires. It's like having a new friend."
3,The Long Loneliness,"This book is Dorothy Day's own autobiography. I know she was a remarkable woman. Everything that I have seen and heard about her has been outstanding. I was excited when I found this book.However, I felt disappointed by this book. It was rather boring and dry. Dorothy must have been very humble, because she writes about herself in a mundane fashion. It sounds like this is the diary account of her life. I guess she must not have realized how heroic she really was. She also experienced significant pain and isolation in her life, hence the title."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this book because I wanted to gain some insight into Dorothy Day's life and I wanted to learn what CatholicWorkers was all about. In the beginning of the book, Dorothy says she doesn't want to write about other people, but about herself. However, I got really tired reading about this friend and that friend and how wonderful this person is and how great that person is. It seemed to me that this whole book was about the different people in her life and how wonderful they were. I quit reading with only about 30 pages left to finish the book, but I just couldn't take it anymore. Maybe it's just me."
5,...and it is still going on.,"Of all the books ever given to me as a gift, this is still my favorite. Granted, the first third of the book, for me, was a bit slow...not boring, just slow. But I knew it would be worth it to trudge on, and I was right. By the end of the book I felt as if I had read one of the most important autobiographies I would ever read. Dorothy Day lived a life worth emulating. It was a life radically reconfigured by her ability to take Jesus simply at his word when he said to visit those in prison, feed the hungry, and clothe the naked. This is the kind of life you get when you follow, literally, those oh-so difficult words as found in the sermon on the mount. This is a book worthy of your time."
3,It satisfied my curiosity regarding Dr. Day.,"I really didn't know anything about Dorothy Day, so the book really helped me to know all about her life. It was for the most part very interesting, but there were parts of the book where I would skip because they no longer interested me. However, I am very grateful for the parts of the book that held my interest. By the way, I just requested to be put on the mailing list of The Catholic Worker."
4,Not just for catholics,This is an interesting story about her life especially if you have never readanything about her. I have read a great deal about her work and life.I recommend this book but There is much more to be said about The CatholicWorker and the housing of needy people that is available if you care to read more.
3,"Good popsicles, but..","Great popsicles, great form, easy enough removal, but it is difficult to get the sticks to stand straight up and down in the forms, so it's difficult to get the lid on and off."
2,They're nice looking.,"They're nice looking molds, the only problem is that they're not easy to slip out! If I make my own ice pops, I have to let them thaw for awhile before I can enjoy an ice pop and when I'm on the go, it's a tad annoying. Other than that nit picking matter, they seem nice. Just be careful of your fingers on the metal top."
4,Great product but...,"Great product - I love the classic shape and heavy duty structure.Only feedback I would have is the sticks that are included with the product are too big. Order the ""Progressive Freezer Pop Sticks"" - you'll like them much better!Watermelon and Cucumber popcicles are in the freezer at the moment!"
1,Not Made in USA,"Amazon says that this product is Made in USA, but it isn't, according to the package that showed up. If USA-made is important to you like it is to me, you'll want to pass on this one."
2,Make your own flavors - VERY HARD TO GET JUST ONE POPSICLE OUT!,"Oh yes it is a very wonderful way to make your own flavors with juice, etc. TRY TO GET JUST ONE POPSICLE OUT WITHOUT MELTING OTHERS OR HAVING OTHERS FALL OUT!!! Before you buy anything - think about it!!!"
1,not as represented,"I have not used this product yet, but am unhappy with my initial impressions. I bought this product because the information on the Amazon website said it was made in the USA. Imagine my surprise when I opened the package and the product was stamped ""Made in Taiwan"". As all the popsicle makers on the Amazon website seem to be made in China, I will gain nothing by returning my order. I am very disappointed by the inaccurate information about my purchase and will consider buying from brick and mortar stores in the future where I can see for myself where a product was made. It is very important to me to be able to buy US made products whenever possible."
1,poor design,The norpro ice pop maker is the most NON-user friendly purchase I have ever made. Nothing about it works well - it's actually going in the garbage can.
3,Better Molds Out There & Lid Slots too narrow,"Returning this for a different model. Reasons:1. The lid is dangerously sharp (defect?)2. Most of the slots for the sticks aren't wide enough, even for the sticks included with the item.3. There are no instructions included (no cleaning instructions, no mention of BPA-free plastic, etc). (It's also difficult to wash the contraption with the attached molds).4. It's nearly impossible to find food-grade pop sticks. The ones currently for sale on this site look nothing like the picture and craft sticks are not food safe."
4,Great product - false advertising,"While the Norpro popsicle maker is wonderful and makes excellent popsicles, I'm disappointed in the product description. I am trying to purchase goods made in the USA which is where the product details assured me this item was made. Upon receiving the popsicle mold, I checked the box to see if it was, in fact, made in USA. Turns out, the company, Norpro, is based in Washington, but the mold itself is manufactured in Taiwan. So frustrating!I spent hours researching popsicle molds to find one that was USA made, easy to clean, BPA-free, etc, and was so excited about this product...only to be completely let down upon receiving it.Please change the product description so customers know where this product is actually made."
2,SHARP METAL use caution when opening!,"I am writing this review before having even used the product. I kind of wanted to get this review out there ASAP. Product arrived. I went to open it to wash it before putting it in the cupboard... and within 3 seconds of unpacking it from the box I cut my finger pretty badly. The slots on the 'lid' (where the sticks go through) is very sharp aluminum. Knowing this, as an adult you will probably be fine using it. However, it's popsicles and most of us will enlist children to help. So beware of this part. Note -- the metal on the popsicle mold side is not sharp."
3,Ice Pop Maker,"This Ice Pop Maker does its job it creates popsicles. I really enjoyed making my own popsicles and I had no problem with the metal cover getting stuck since I took it off right before it got frozen. My only criticism would be that the sugar I used for my popsicle recipe collected in the bottom and so when you ate the popsicles the top of the popsicles were very, very sweet and the bottom was very bland. But I still like the product very much and will continue using it."
2,good concept,"The popsicles that come from this are great shape and size. The trouble is when the sticks shift and are going in different directions, the lid won't come off. The sticks kind of lock the metal lid in place. This may be better with wider sticks that won't tilt in the slot during freezing process."
4,summer fun!,Works like a charm! Easy to use and clean. So much fun to try all different kinds of ice pops. Now to find bamboo sticks so I'm not wasting precious wood :)
5,Pop Maker,My new most favorite toy! Having a great time trying out all sorts of different new ideas to make into ice pops. Finding new ways to use fruit I was afraid might go to waste. Fantastic!
1,A little difficult,"I wanted to start making my own fruit pops since I have a great juicer. The molds are nice. Getting the sticks in requires using metal binder clips to keep the sticks from sinking into the mold before freezing. So if you buy this product make sure you have an equal number of binder clips. The binder clip situation didn't bother me too much, however, trying to get the molds out did. What you don's see in this picture is that under the blue top, there is a thick sliver metal plat that the molds rest in. Trying to pop the molds out of the metal plate is a whole other store. It's a fight trying to get the molds to pop up with the sticks. It's not an easy task at all. I do not recommend this product. In fact, I will be looking for new molds myself. I will probably donate this product to the Goodwill and hope I don't cause any poor soul to curse."
1,Terrible. Avoid.,"There are other kits in Amazon that do a far better job. I would void purchasing this one, although for the money you won't go broke."
3,Yum!,"If you soak the sticks in water for about an hour before you use them, they won't float up or expand...making it easier to get them out of the tray after the popsicles are frozen. Enjoy!!"
2,it's ok but....,"I like the Donvier molds better. This has a steel plate on top with holes for the sticks. Unfortunately, the sticks sink or float to the side because the holes are too big. You have to hold the mold under warm water for about 10 seconds to get a frozen pop out of the mold."
4,great alternative for store bought popcicles,I use this product a couple times a week. I like that it makes 10 at a time. Dislike that you have to remember not to fill all the way. Also you have to remember to make your sticks straight before the popcicles are to hard. If you don't do this you'll have to bend your lid to get it off. I like to use foil as an alternative lid.
4,Icecream bar/ popsicle solution,"Got this to make fudgesicles, as was disapointed in the quality of the commercial ones. Once I got the hang of how to remove the bars, it was good.The only negative was, I had to trial-and-error it (to learn how) as the instuctions were very lacking in detail. The shape of the plastic mold is great; the bars come out looking quite nice."
2,Not Dishwasher Safe?,"Watch out! The metal in this mold is made of brushed aluminum -- which isn't dishwasher safe!My husband gave me this popsicle mold for my birthday, and I was thrilled. The first set of popsicles were just fabulous -- I didn't have any problems with getting the lid on or off, and the treats popped right out after running the mold under some warm water. We stored the popsicles in plastic baggies for later consumption and then put the mold and its lid in the dishwasher to be cleaned.I was completely dismayed when it came out -- the metal had darkened, with strange streaks and discoloration all over. Hopefully we won't end up with metallic residue on our next batch of popsicles.There is no indication on the product's packaging that it needs to be hand-washed, but I guess it does.Otherwise, a great product, but buyer beware."
3,Hard to remove!,"I would have given this a better rating but the Popmaker's lid is very hard to use. When you try to remove the pops, the metal lid is difficult to take off. Then its hard to remove the individual pops from the holder. I have a pretty strong husband and he had a hard time removing a pop to eat. Next time I will be looking for one that wont have that problem."
1,Terrible Product!,The metal on the top of this popsicle holder rubs off. It is terrible! I can't imagine it being heathy eating metal. What a waste of money!
3,Hard to remove just one pop,I thought I could remove one pop at a time but that can't be done. I currently take them all out and wrap the unused pops in saran wrap. It works but it would be better if I could remove a single pop.
1,Get this popsicle out of here!!!!,"With really small, tight holes, what seems like a fun and simple product turns into a complicated nightmare. This is not for use with regular popsicle sticks. Now I have to find some skinny designer sticks so that I can keep using this product? Lame."
4,iceblock mould,"works well, when filling dont fill right to the top, so that the lid comes off otherwise it will stick. Plus dont push sticks too far in to the mould or you wont have enough to hang onto. Just submerge the mould into lukewarm water for about 10 seconds and they will pop out easily."
3,included wooden sticks don't fit through slots on cover!!,The set of wooden sticks that came with the molds DO NOT FIT THROUGH THE SLOTS!!!!!I had to whittle some down to use them. Crazy!
1,Terrible design,I would NOT recommend buying this product. The sticks were too hard to get through the lid and impossible to get out when frozen. I wish the individual molds came out!! Makes me wish I had listened to the bad reviews of this product and bought something better. Sad. If I could give this zero stars I would have.
3,Some room for improvement (and popsicle sticks),"For the most part I am heartily pleased with this purchase. The molds are sturdy, and if I want only one popsicle I can remove one mold to hold under the tap rather than mess around with the lot of them and thereby risking the integrity of my other treats.That said, however, I was very disappointed to find that the popsicle sticks that came with the mold don't actually fit into the slots of the mold cover. In order to fit them in I've resorted to ""shaving"" off the excess by shoving the sticks through the slots a number of times. This is frustrating, time consuming, and a little bit unsafe as there's a splinter factor to consider. It's also unbelievably stupid. Since they don't appear to be anything special I have to assume that these are just normal sticks, and when I purchase regular sized replacements I'll meet the same construction issues. Bummer.However, it's a decently priced product that is (mostly) well made."
1,THIS IS NOT MADE IN THE USA,"THIS PRODUCT IS NOT MADE IN THE USA LIKE IT SAYS, IT ALSO SAYS NO WHERE ON THE PACKAGE THAT ITS BPA FREE PLASTIC, IT SAYS MADE IN TAIWAN.... IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT THAT IS MADE OUT OF SAFE PLASTIC THIS IS NOT FOR YOU."
3,Where the product was made.,I'm disappointed that you would say your popsicle molds were Made in USA when in fact they are Made in Taiwan for your company. One of the reasons I bought this product was because it was Made in USA. I consider this false advertising.
1,Impossible to find a decent popsicle tray,"messy, hard to pop out the popsicles (that is if you can even maneuver the metal mold off the base)....disappointing"
2,Do Not Dishwash!,"I put my mold in the dishwasher and the metal parts turned black-ish and ashy. I guess I should have checked, but now it looks permanently crappy."
2,how the heck do you take off the lid??,"I have used it 3 times and each time I spend 15-20 minutes trying to take off the lid. I tried using less juice with same results. And the sticks don't fit right, they are either too small or too big. There were no instructions at all."
3,Popsicle Maker,The construction is good but the sticks have to be standing straight up in order to remove the cover. If they are leaning one way or the other just the slightest bit you will need to break the sticks to remove the cover. A bit overpriced as far as I'm concerned.
3,Not worth the effort,"The Norpro Popsicle maker is made well. The plastic popsicle holder is sturdy and does not bend when removing the pops. The stainless steel top maintains it shape. However, the slots do not hold the stick in place and the sticks move. This makes it difficult to remove since the sticks fall and block removal. We wait until the mixture is setting before we insert the sticks now. In addition there are no instructions included with the maker. It has been a trail and error operation. Our intention was to make our own fruit juice pops and save money. However, the amount of our time to prepare and remove the pops is not worth the savings. We are open to any suggestions that others might have to offer!!"
2,Norpro Ice Pop Maker: Review,"This thing is a pain in the butt. The metal tray that goes on top is very hard to lift off once the pop sickles are frozen. The problem is, the sticks continuously get wedged in the holes in the tray. I wouldn't buy another one like this."
3,Bit Difficult,"This is an ok product. The pops are difficult to get out but you have to be able to pry that metal lid off first. Difficult to do when it is frozen to the bottom part. Still, my little guy just loved being able to make the pops. Good recipes included with product."
4,Nice Ice Pop Maker,Had no problems with maker. Used it all summer long and made a variety of flavors. I would recommend this product.
5,After reading the reviews I bought it and we LOVE IT!!!,"When looking for a mold I wanted one that was BPA free and this ones states that it is and I didn't see any others (plastic ones) that were. I saw it had some negative reviews so I read through them and also read the good reviews stating how they got theirs to work great. I followed their advice of not filling the molds all the way, freezing for 30 minutes before putting the top on and sticks in, putting under warm water for a few seconds before wiggling out. I also found the small popsicle sticks at a craft store and got 300 of them for about $4 so we are set. I've been rinsing it right after I get the popsicles out then washing it by hand later. The kids go absolutely nuts over the popsicles. They never even ask to go out for ice cream because these feel so special to them. This has definitely added some fun to our summer and they are always excited to see what kind we can make next. I highly recommend this product so far."
4,Norpro Ice Pop Maker We love it!,"With the exception of the sticks being difficult to get and stay upright, this is a great little gadget. Makes pops like you buy in the store. To get the sticks to stand straight up we cut 2 small blocks of wood for each stick and wrapped a rubber band around them. Keeps them nice and snug so they can't sink down or move from side to side. Makes perfect pops everytime! I'm suprised at the few who said they had a hard time getting the pops out of the molds. We have had no such experience."
4,How to hold the sticks in place . . .,"This product is not quite complete. Without some help, the sticks sink all the way to the bottom of the molds or skew off to the sides. You're going to need office supplies.I find that 3/4"" binder clips, turned on their sides, hold the sticks perfectly straight and at the distance into the mold that I choose. The clips rest against the metal top, so there is no contact with the frozen pop. When you are ready to unmold, all ten sticks will be aligned for easier removal of the metal top plate.That's it. 3/4"" binder clips, available everywhere office supplies are sold. You'll probably also find them in the supply closet at the office. That's not where I got them, but hey, maybe you're feeling bitter about that raise you didn't get."
5,Very Pleased,I really enjoy them and if people would use common sense they would like them also. It is so nice to find a product that is made in the U.S.A.That is very hard to find these days.
2,Massive struggle to fit popsicle sticks into top!,"Re product received on July 11, 2012:There are many reviews here about popsicle sticks fitting loosely in the top and floating up during the freezing process. The manufacturer must have tried to correct this problem by making the holes more narrow. Now the problem is that the holes are so narrow that many of the popsicle sticks that CAME IN THE BOX with the product do not fit!! I discarded several that could not fit, and was able to finally get some in, but it took a lot of effort.It was also something of a struggle to get the top off once the pops were frozen. That said, once the pops were finally out (run some hot water over the molds for 10 seconds or so), they turned out very well.The good thing about this mold is the portion size -- each pop is about 3 oz., which is a nice size, in my view."
3,Sticks don't fit!,The sticks that were included with it were too big so wouldn't fit in the slots. Wtf?!?! I was so angry that I was planning on returning the maker but decided to see if the progressive sticks I ordered as well via amazon fit. They do so I'm keeping it. I cannot believe norpro includes such crap sticks that don't work with their product. I made one batch and the popsicles came out great. I love the shape of the pops bc they look like the kinds you get from the store. I'm giving this product 3 stars bc of the stupidity of norpro's choice of crap sticks.
5,Great Look,I orderd these planters last year for the very upscale designed office where I used to work. They fit in perfectly with the rest of the office and looked great! None of us were disappointed.
1,Lousy Editing Job,"I have read ""The Little Minister"" by J. M. Barrie in the past, and the story itself is wonderful.However, I do have a complaint with the company (The Book Jungle) that published this edition.Apparently this edition was not proof read, because there were countless errors.1. Many spots where whole blocks of paragraphs were missing from a chapter, or interspersed in another chapter altogether.2. Several spots where there were duplicated blocks of paragraphs in the same chapter.3. Many inappropropriate spelling errors.4. Punctuation errors, for example periods in inappropriate places, breaking up the sentence structure in the wrong spots.Overall, I was very disappointed in this particular edition. I have to say it was the worst publication of a book that I have ever read.And the sad thing was, it cost almost $20.00Buyers beware!"
4,Updated Gin Rummy,"I purchased this as an extra gift for my nephew for Christmas. We all wound up playing it right away. It's a dragon take on gin rummy with a few twists. We managed to keep kids who were 8, 14 and 17 and a few adults busy for a while. Everyone enjoyed it."
4,"Get this album, for the title track alone !","The first time we had this CD on, I didn't get to hear the title track, The Well, and some of the rest of the album seemed kind of underpowered. But upon further listening, I can't but feel that ""The Well"" alone is worth the price of this album. Some of the other songs are pretty good too, of course. JW is simply amazing, I haven't listened to her much since I borrowed a friend's copy of Famous Blue Raincoat, and now I have to pick up some more CDs to make up for the lack."
5,"why we had to wait, and why the wait was worth it","I've listened to the samples on this album, and didn't have to read through all of the reviews to make up my mind. This album is definitely a ""must-have"". I could repeat all of the accolades that others have penned about this album, but I won't. But to answer some of the respondants questions on why we had to wait so long? Blame it on the short-sighted music label exec's who forced her to shelve a project she was working on after ""The Hunter"" came out. They refused to fund the finishing of her subsequent release. 2 years of work, went down the drain. If you want to find out more, go to her web-site (...) It will definitely make you feel better....believe me, she appreciates her fans and everyones support."
5,Truly Remarkable,"For years I only knew of Jennifer Warnes through her top 40 hits. While getting into the music of Leonard Cohen, I heard Famous Blue Raincoat and my appreciation for this artist dramatically increased. And while I enjoyed The Hunter, The Well touched me far deeper. Her voice is as clear, expressive and nuanced as ever -- The Well has the same level of excellence as she displayed in Raincoat. The musicianship, arrangements, and recording are excellent too. The musical styles are varied and rich in this album. In the songs she co-wrote, along with the covers, she displays a remarkable emotional range. Yes, this is a truly remarkable album. As good as Raincoat is, this may be her finest release ever. And yes, I think it's also quite remarkable that the CD is out of print. I bought my copy used . . . and it was certainly worth it."
4,Transparent Soap,"Well researched usage of the ""hot process"" method of soap preparation. Many useful pointers to achieve transparent soap.Semi-technical material written in a fashion that could be mastered by a non technical reader.Underlying explanations a written in a way, that make me suspect the author is self taught in organic chemistry. Pretty impressive for that.Would have been nice to get more hard-core organic explanations, but I realize you would lose more than a few readers that way. (dipole moment and solvent behavior, the structure/property relationship of fatty acids - etc.)In the preface she writes that business people see what is not there - and she is dead on - no one had written a digestible transparent soap book that I am aware.Leaves the field wide open for more books IMHO.I agree that methods not including high grain alcohol would help those of us living in oppressive regimes."
3,Nice pictures!,"This book is fun to look at. It book is clear and well written in making transparent soap with alcohol from scratch. However, this is not the only way to make transparent soap, and the author fails to provide the alternative. Soap made with alcohol dries your skin, and it cannot be remelted for m&p project. Finding the alcohol for the recipe is also a pain. If this book had the recipe of how to make clear m&p soap base, it would be the ultimate transparent soap book!"
4,"Good resource book, but not complete enough for new soap makers","I am very happy I purchased this book. Catherine Failor does an decent job of explaining the transparent soap making process. There is a lot of useful information. However, for someone making their first soaps, it is my opinion there is a lot of incomplete and/or unclear information. If you want to make transparent soap, this is a must for your technical library, but it is not the only book you will need."
3,Time consuming,This book is for crafters who want to make the actual soap base. I prefer to purchase the soap base & craft soaps with different colors & scents & shapes.
3,Dissapointed,"It is cute, the colors look beautiful, but it is so small, the image is nothing compared to the size when you receive it."
5,american hardcore yah!!!,"this band is not one to be messed with, true american hardcore, that i'll slap you in the face and make you think twice. compares to the boston usa's Ten Yard Fight, and the Chain of Strength from california usa. this makes mosh happen yah!! sxe true till death, for sure."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,The hair on the wig is longer on the left than the right. The style is completely unrecognizable from the photo. Don't buy it.
3,The back cover description is:,"The back cover description is:Love is the riskiest business of allIf Sophie Foster counted her blessings, her children would top the list-except when their obsession with finding a father puts her on the spot. Like that day two of them decided to ensnare a member of the wealthy Abbott clan who they agree would be perfect for the part-if he won't so addicted to danger.Sophie knows that handsome sawyer Abbott does stunts to raise money for good causes, but bitter experience has taught her that men who live on the edge end up hurting themselves and the people who love them............It goes on but it's basically a woman trying to go on with her life after her abusive husband dies in a car accident and her effort to stop being afraid."
4,Wish there was more!,"I first heard Anna Sato on the Healing Collection 5 cd, ""Footprints on the Moon"". I really enjoyed that song. I searched the greatest web site ""Amazon"" for more of her music. Kyurauta has some beautiful songs and she mixes tradional Japanese music with contemporary. Unfortunately there are only 4 songs on the cd and 1 is an instrumental. But I am hooked and will purchase more. I really enjoy her music."
4,inspirational and educative,I have been a member of the home foundation online classes and was fortunate to have read this book. Only if you communicate you would know the purity and intent of this book. It is a work for serious seekers and not for everyone. Thank you Carl for all the guidance. OM.
4,The long term companion,"This book is not for everyone. Those who have started on the spiritual path or those who feel they are missing something in their lives will benefit from it. The author does not profess to be a Guru, just another person like us. This is what makes the book so special. It shows that the spiritual evolution is not for just a chosen few but for all of us.As one progresses on the spiritual path, one will keep coming back to re-read parts of this book as it offers ever new insights every time. The book greatly supplements the Kriya Classes held by Carl Schmidt on the internet. I wish all who read this book great joy and peace."
5,enlightenment is bliss...,"i have only love and admiration for ""Carl Schmidt""... through his book ""A RECIPE FOR BLISS"" and the online classes that he offered i have had glimpses of the bliss of which he speaks... i am only a novice... yet in such a short time i've experienced the most profound spiritual enlightenment i've ever known... i feel as if i've touched my very soul... my inner being... my creator... all my life i have always looked outside for answers... Carl showed me that the way in... is the way out...lol...""it's a wonderful day in the neighborhood boys and girls""..."
2,Lots of seasonings but no meat,"Recipe for Bliss certainly conveys the many inner experiences and insights one gleans from a spiritual path, but for the seeker of knowledge Schmidt's prose proves to be more cryptic than clarifying. If you are serious about learning technique this book is not the one to buy. Kriya technique itself is probably best left to those who are the original disseminators of this meditation path , namely Paramahansa Yogananda's Self Realization Fellowship."
5,The First Kriya `The Sacred Heart`,Having read and being an on-line student with the hOMe Foundation through the enlightened Teachings of Carl Schmidt from his book `Recipe for Bliss`l have gained much insight into a profound practice.lf you wish to gain connection to your Teacher who has always been with you but may not have appeared before you.lf you are a seeker of Spirit and wish to find a remarkable practice that resonates deep within you a `Harmonious Tone` essential to your spiritual essence that in reality takes you HOME.Then this book is for you.The First Kriya `The Sarced Heart`ls for sure a Recipe for Bliss.That one Practice in the book will deepen your connection before you read further.A book written with great lntegity of spirit and a deep devotion to the enlightenment of all beings and plenty heart.

5,Mood by Robert Glasper,"haven't got to it yet. been in the hospital.....but I must say this, I got his first record and he blew my socks off, so anything else has to be good."
2,"If you liked George Saunders, forget this","If you surfed here via a recommendation link from a George Saunders collection, don't be fooled by the descriptions. This book of short stories bears little relation to Saunders in either style or substance. Derby's m.o. is to describe people, objects and events from a slightly skewed and overly literal point of view. This apparently ""satirical"" approach works for perhaps one or two stories but soon becomes tiresome and hard going thereafter."
3,This is a VERY strange book.,"Through a collection of short stories - well, vignettes is perhaps a better term - the book recounts a fictional future. And while it is a fast, engaging read, very reminiscent ofThe Handmaid's Tale, it frankly makes little sense. The writing is strong... but there isn't really enough of it there to redeem the book. Maybe this would be better for a book club so that there could be a discussion about it... because, I must admit, some meaning was definitely lost on me. It is interesting, though I would have preferred this idea to be presented in the more traditional novel form... I never have been a big fan of short stories, after all, and these feel especially brief even for the sub-genre."
1,You gotta be kidding me!,"Seriously, this product is available at Target, right now, for less than $5. There is no way anyone should pay nearly $20 more for the exact same thing!"
2,DKNY makes terrific tights but...,"...they are not described entirely accurately here. The very fuzzy photo of the DKNY label above, if it were legible, would mention that the items on offer here are the CONTROL TOP version of the tights. (I do see it mentioned lower down, but not in the headline.) Personally, I find them to be not as comfortable, nor as opaque, nor as long-lasting, as the opaque non-control top version from DKNY. Otherwise, I would completely agree with the other reviewer who gave 5 stars for DKNY.Also, be aware that this seller charges shipping both ways, if you need to return items."
5,Best tight for tall women,"Having worn many other brands of panty hose size ""tall"" with the crotch hitting just above the knee, I was so happy to find DKNY tights. They not only fit but last a long time, even with machine washing. Great for taller women."
5,Love these tights,"I have to give these tights five stars. It is so difficult to find tights if you are short, and these fit the bill. Not too difficult to get on, don't roll down, don't snag easily. I get a ton of wear out of them before a pair has to be retired. Very happy with product and seller. I saved five dollars over the dept store price, and shipping was free. I received them very quickly. Great job Amazon and Fresh Pair!"
2,MORAFFS MAXIMUM MAHJONGG,"I bought this game based on cutomer reviews now I'm sorry I did.It might be great on WIN 98 but on WIN XP it AIN'T so great!Music plays a tune or two then stops. When you try to select a music file it hangs the computer.Difficulty in changing tilesests. Changing backgrounds a breeze.Too many penalties for honest game players.No 'undo' option.In general, POOR performance."
5,Marks of the Mission,I am a .... year old female and my mom gave me this CD a while back. Charles autographed it for me. I love this music. I sing it all the time and know the words to every song. He is trully an example of a role model for me and others my age.Thank You Charles for singing and most importantly singing for Our Holy One! I recommend this for kids! Lots of catchy tunes with an inspirational message.
1,Not the best songs,"I only recently have been turned on by Charles Billingsley's incredible voice and awesome vocal presentation of inspirational songs. I've seen many tv performances and I'm always amazed at his vocal deliveries and beautiful melodies. I must tell you that this cd does not do him justice! I've listened carefully to each song and none have jumped out and grabbed me as I would've hoped. This purchase has been a big disappointment. Though there are strong messages and many upbeat songs, they seem to lose power and interest before entering the choruses and the melodies seem to stray. You can easily identify the typical studio mixes (pressed out) and indicate they are quick mixes.I do have another of his cd's on order and I hope to find some different songs that I can put on rotation. I do enjoy listening to his strong vocals but unfortunately, I cannot recommend this cd."
5,Still my favorite Boheme after forty years,"I fell in love with this recording forty years ago when I owned it on vinyl. When I found it was available on CD I had to have it. The cast is superb, the interpretation lush. If I could only own one opera recording, this would have to be it. If you love Puccini, you need this CD."
4,Sounds Great with a few flaws,Acquired the S.A.C.D. hybrid version my fist classical Opera purchase; the only thing I find bothersome is all the coughing in Act III or it noise created by actors on stage antics; the recording have wide dynamic range unlike today's compression trend.
5,La Boheme/Mary Costa,"To have the pleasure of listening to any songs performed by Mary Costa, is a treat unto itself! Any song she sings, is magnificent and beautifully feminine -- superb! (Walt Disney knew what he had found, when he offered her the voice of Sleeping Beauty.) Mary Costa's exquisite performance in La Boheme is warm and embracing! Wonderful! Always 5 Stars to Mary Costa!"

3,Wouldnt buy again,"I think the quality for this set has a little to be desired. It was a little crooked, it wouldnt set flat. I bent it a bit but it feels flimsy and not too well made. The bottles dont sit firmly in their slot. For the price I wish I would have skipped it. It looks exactly like what I wanted but the quality is different in person than in the pic. I needed several and am glad I just ordered one."
2,Functional but cheap,"Product is okay. Tops are very cheap, don't fit well. Labels were not included with product, description states labels are included. I haven't put them through dishwasher yet, but as low quality as they feel, I worry there will likely be issues with rust. Would not recommend. Spend a few more dollars for higher quality product."
3,AT&T cordless phone,OK. Nothing special. The worst thing that ever happened in my life was the 'busting up' of Ma Bell. We are stuck with stuff like this now.
3,The best of the Readman era....,"First off, I'm more of an Andi Deris/Helloween fan. But I have a few of the David Readman era PC 69 cds (Thunderdome, Electrified, Endangered). This one seems to have stronger songs, and stands out of those. Electrified is also solid, while Endangered seem a bit more filler. The ever stable line up of Dennis Ward(bass), Alfred Koffler(guitar), and Kosta Zafiriou(drums), with keyboardist Guenter Werno on a couple of tracks. The title track is quite good, and was stuck in my head a while. Very catchy."
5,PC 68 rocks,I found out about this band a couple years ago. They are fantastic. It's a shame nobody in the USA has heard of them. They are truly gifted musicians and song writers. Electrified is another awesome album. GO BUY IT.
5,The best band no one's ever heard of!,"What's up with Pink Cream 69? They have a funny name, but this band really rocks. They're officially a German band, but the lead singer is from England and bass player is from the USA. There isn't a bad song on Thunderdome, but the best track is ""Gods Come Together"". This band would have been a hit in the US if all this so-called ""alternative"" rock hadn't come around in the early 90s. They are very talented, sound excellent and are fun to listen to. They will be at the Prog Power USA VI in Atlanta in Sept. 2005 - I'll definately be there to see them live! Go by the album, you'll listen to it over and over."
4,Great songs -- wish they were longer.....,"All the songs are great, beautiful..... just wish they were longer in length. Seems they are all shortened versions. All the songs seem to be less than 2 minutes each."
3,"great songs, a little too slow","This CD has some of the greatest praise and worship songs ever, but they are all just a little on the slow side, and I find myself wishing they were just a step up on the tempo. Most of the songs are not in my key, and I can't really sing along with this one very well, maybe that's my singing voice, not the cd, but just the same, I prefer the ""Songs for Worship"" CD's instead."
4,added surprise,"The 25 praise songs are ok. Since there are so many songs on the CD, the songs are very short... but the bonus/sampler CD that came with it is wonderful! I listen to that more than any other CD at this point in time.The bonus sampler by itself was worth the price."
5,A Quick Scan of the Bible,"EVERY writtenSENTENCE CONTAINS and includes a centralCORE MEANING with excess words and verbiage which merely modify the message.HIGHLIGHTING IMPORTANT WORDS in a passageLETS THE READER skip the modifiers andQUICKLY SCAN the passage forTHE CORE MEANING.Go back to the previous paragraph and read only the words in all capitals.

5,Kwikscan Bible,This is a great book. Very easy to read and understand. I think it should be put back in print.

2,I expected a better product from HP,"I bought this camera for a good price, but I'm disappointed. I really expected a better product from HP. This is what I don't like in this camera:-Video resolution is only 320x240-Sometimes it takes too long for the camera to save pictures in my SD card-No optical viewfinder-You have to download your videos to the computer to hear audio, since there's no built-in speaker-On/off button is poorly designed (I have to press it several times to turn the camera on/off)I have a 2-year-old Kodak Easyshare camera, and it's far superior to this product.Buy it at your own risk. In my case, I'll return this product to the store. HP cameras disappointed me."
3,HP Photosmart M525 Digital Camera,"My daughter uses this camera all the top. Does a decent job taking pictures with good resolution and downloads pictures to computer without trouble. Overall, a decent, basic digital camera for the kids just starting out."
4,Digital Camera,I had a product like this that had stopped working so found this one and it is working fine. No problems with it. Arrived as promised.
3,HP Photosmart Digital Camera a Great Buy,"This was my first purchase of a used item on Amazon. I needed to know theprocedure and it was clearly explained by Amazon. I was looking for aHewlett Packard digital camera that would be compatibale with my HP dock.I preferred to purchase a ""used"" camera if possible. I checked to seewhat HP camera would be compatiable to my docket and the PhotosmartM525 was. I was impressed that the seller had been rated by Amazon anda rating that indicatad that I would get what was represented. I purchasedthe camera and it arrived in a few days. I have taken many great picturesand transferred them to my computer for printing. Good job Amazon."
1,Critical is the key word,"Reading this book is like watching bloopers after a good program.The only problem is... there is no good program here, only the bloopers. The fact that the author is biased is not the big issue (all authors are), but Mr. Van Creveld doesn't even attempt to disguise it. As far as the writing is concerned, the book is boring and repetitious and the constant comparisons of Israeli tactics with those of the Nazis are utterly sickening. If you're interested in the History of the IDF, avoid this book. There are much better and serious works out there. But if you insist, I'll be selling it for 50 cents at my next garage sale."
4,See This Hilarious Short Lived Serious,"Following the tried and true ""Candid Camera"" model, JKX is an excellent if uynderated show. Hosted by Jamie Kennedy (Malibu's Most Wanted), JKX is Laugh out loud hilarious! In this third and final season jaimie takes his show on the road going to cities like Chicago, New York City, Miami, and many more. What's great about this season is that the sketches are specific to the city that the show is in i.e. The sketches are shot using marks from that city. My personal favorite was shot in NYC and has Jamie squeezing 20 or so people into the worlds smallest apartment. You have to see it for your self!"
2,The balls are great but only recieved 6 not 12 as listed!,These balls are top quaility however the listing was for a dozen balls so when I got my package I was very dissapointed to find out that there was only 6 balls not 12 as promised. Amazon did correct the problem by refunding me half the purchase price.
3,"Short, puzzling and Vlad didn't kill anyone?","I enjoy the Vlad Taltos character, wit and stories very much, but Issola left me dry. Although a necessary tale in the history of the character the whole story dragged on, and left too many questions and unfulfilled expectations that I had from the moment I heard the book was to be published. The style of writing and timing elements that were present in Dragon and Taltos are in my opinion pure genius and show a real fore thought and planning for the character. The story telling elements in Athyra, Orca and Yendi, give the reader an appreciation for the whole character of Vlad by seeing him through other character's eyes. These elements are what I missed from Issola. I will treasure this book in my collection, but it may not be one I reread for quite some time."
3,"Good enough collection, but...","...don't make the same mistake that I did. I bought this collection expecting to get something new, but this is the same show as is included with the release ofI Want a Dog for Christmas, Charlie Brown."
3,Only for the bonus episode,"This video is just excerpts from other Peanuts holiday specials, all of which I already had. The only thing that didn't make me send it back was the bonus episode about Linus and Lucy moving to another town."
5,Add it to your Charlie Brown collection.,"Purchased for my daughter to add to her collection. She received 4 Charlie Brown dvds, each one diffeerent. Great for holiday viewing."
5,Love Peanuts,"The stories aren't new but they are timeless. If you love Snoopy and/or ""Peanuts,"" you'll enjoy this collection of Peanut's Christmas tales. The discs quality are good."
3,Learn About Florida's Elder Abuse and Fraud before you move!,"Florida is not so beautiful if you're abused and bilked. Get the real truth about the fraud and abuse of the elderly and not so elderly and read ""Retirement Nightmare"" by Diane Armstrong. To avoid a guardianship in the State of Florida, and other states, should be of paramount importance. Find out how to protect yourself and your loved ones with alternatives: health care surrogate, durable power of attorney, mediation and more. Consider that if you leave your parents to fend for themselves, and ignore the deterioration associated with aging, a guardian can gain a guardianship over them and their assets, without informing you. That guardianship will nullify the most meticulous of plans. To really cover your aging parents, make sure they create a ""Pre-need"" guardianship and name someone they trust, this is the only way predators in the retirement homes will not be able to force guardianship on them. Also create an irrevocable trust."
2,Highly biased & out of date,"My husband and I needed to relocate to a mild climate for health reasons. Bought this book and others and decided to look at Florida. We drove the entire state, investigating dozens of communities based upon features listed in this book. Sadly, the book is very outdated --- probably a given since FL is growing so fast. And the biases of the authors towards golfing and upscale shopping made their ratings of the various communities highly biased. What they liked, we hated. After months of personal investigation, we'll be settling in a community that's not on their favorites list. To each his own. The book might be more helpful if it was updated every year. As it is, the statistics are meaningless and misleading."
1,Almost as Old as I am,"This book was published in 1999 and while it claims to be an All New Edition it is anything but. I bought it and when I received it,about 10 dasys ago, and checked it there was absolutely no revision update anywhere to be found so it had to be from 1999. The info contained therein is outdated, valueless and All New Edition is totally misleading and it should be against the law to show it that.Even if it were free, which it wasn't, it is a complete waste of money."
1,out-dated,"I was very disappointed. This was a revised copy, ""Where to Retire in Florida"", but it was published in 1999. That copy we also had. We surely were hoping for something more current and usable.What shall we do with a 1999 copy?George Arrington"
4,Wonderful insight into the criminal mind,This is the book for True Crime fans.I found it fascinating how investigator Douglas was able to tell so much personal information about the criminals from observing the crime scenes.
2,Highly Overrated,"The positive reviews here and the promise of a good story enticed my purchase of the tapes. Unfortunately, this title was very disappointing. I found the reading insipid relative to the several stories of brutal serial killings. One must be quite patient listening to the author's personal history, which is not entirely relevant. It's a wonder the bad grammar passed the editors--or is this perhaps self-published?"
2,Condition Overstated,"The book was priced well and arrived quickly, but the condition of the book was overstated."
1,Douglas Lacks Original Insight,"Much like most books on serial killers, Douglas covers already known information on a popular topic. If you're looking for information on a few cases, it may be of help, but it provides little new information to an already hot topic."
5,"Absolutely Fascinating - A Must for ""Criminal Minds"" fans!!","I have been hooked on the TV show ""Criminal Minds"" lately and was so interested in profiling that I purchased this book. At the time I had no idea that the author was the basis for the main character in my now favorite show. Although undrestandably full of himself, this book gives amazaing insight into the criminal profiling world, discusses many infamous serial killers, and delves into an exciting world of criminal psychology. It has made me want to track down and read every similar book!"
4,A great book about Predators....and Mr. Douglas,"I don't have to say how great this book is, if you have any doubts about this book then just read one of the many great reviews you can find on this site, many of them are giving this book 5 stars ( for many good reasons ). This book is a classic in the True Crime/Serial Killer litterature. The book is really well written, and even if some parts of the book are boring ( the author didn't had to write about how he seduced his wife ) this is a must-own book for any True Crime/Serial Killers/Unsolved Cases buff. Yes, sometimes the author is pretentious and full of himself but hey, this is one of Mr. Douglas' trademarks, if you don't like it then try to not let this bothering you or simply read another book. Reading this book years ago is one of the reasons why I have decided to study in criminology. Thank you mr. Douglas; this book is not perfect but it's a classic of its kind."
5,Un-Be-Lievable!!!,"When someone asks me what my favorite book of all time is, I answer very simply ""Mindhunter"". By far and away the most amazing, intersting, and awe-inspiring book I've ever read. It's simply fascinating what John Douglas was able to determine by simply using his mind and his understanding of pyschology.HIGHLY recommended read. If you have even the slightest interest in forensics and criminal behavior, READ THIS BOOK."
5,Excellent Reading for a True Crime buff,"The book was a quick and excellent read. The author is a man that is great at what he does and is not shy about talking about it. I cannot believe people actually do this to each other. I ordered (from Amazon, of course) his next book, Journey into Darkness, and am happily working my way through. Last year when I contemplated a career in the FBI, I was disappointed in not being able to apply because of my vision. I'm more disappointed now. Order it!!!!"
3,"More correctly titled ""The Making of An FBI Profiler""","What a let-down! This book turns out to be more about Douglas's career development than ""Inside the FBI's Serial Crime Unit"". The few glimpses provided of the unit's work are just enough to keep you from getting really annoyed by one too many personal recollections, i.e. do you really want to know how he picked up his future bride in a bar? and, yes, John, I'm sure you have a great sense of humour but WHO CARES! Some editing may have made it more readable, as it was obviously put together from a series of recorded interviews with Douglas by his co-author. For good measure, Douglas may have also thrown in a few old lecture notes from the FBI Academy course he helped to develop. I notice that he's written several other books but I, for one, will be wary about buying them without the benefit of a good browse first!"
4,A page-turner from cover to cover,"If John Douglas were boasting in ""Mind Hunter,"" it would be annoying. He is not. There is nothing excessive in his earned pride. His accomplishments in the field are inspiring and admirable; so much so that any attempt at humility would be dishonest.For an exciting, fascinating look at the art of profiling criminals, this is the book to read. Then read the book that Douglas himself recommends: Stanton Samenow's ""Inside the Criminal Mind."""
5,Excellent!,"JOHN E. DOUGLAS & MARK OLSHAKER take us on an educational journey of the FBI Serial Crime Unit in MIND HUNTER. The two gentlemen need to be applauded on this easy to read and incredibly in-depth study. If you want to know how they do it, this is the book to read."
1,More about Douglas than actual profiling,"The book is more about Douglas' ego than about profiling. Also, from attending a number of Vernon Geberth's seminars I have come to realize that Douglas laid claim to many cases that he did not solve. To take credit for cases he did not solve is rather pathetic. As stated this book and his other books are just wars stories that many homicide investigators around the country discuss and teach. To learn how to profile read Brent Turvey's book, Criminal Profiling: An Introduction to Behavioral Evidence Analysis."
2,So far so ok? I guess...,"I think I made the right choice of reading this book after reading Whoever Fights Monster by/about Robert Ressler of the FBI who held John Douglas' job before him. Mind Hunter seems to be the same book but in a slightly different style and it really seems to be written only to try and capitalize on the success of Whoever Fights Monster's success. WFM's was a good read, this, not so much... This is sorta blah... bland... Probably because the good stuff was already in WFM's, but I do think it's worth reading if you are into stuff on the FBI and/or serial killers."
2,Mind Hunter: The Auto-Biography of John Douglas,"NOTE: 110 people gave this book 5 stars, so clearly many people liked this book.If you have read every serial killer book and are bored with individual killers, this book might be for you. Douglas really takes the opportunity to tell his life story. The prologue and first few chapters are entirely a personal account of Douglas' life. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I wasn't expecting him to tell about the pros and cons of playing defensive line on his high school football team for 2 pages.Seriously, it's that detailed about Douglas' upbringing. Additionally, it's nauseatingly braggadocio. He tells a story of how he completely astonishes some serial rapist by revealing intimate details about his personal life during a group therapy session - and I had to shut the book and walk away from the ridiculousness of it.I would have given this book 2 stars, but nobody reads those."
4,A non-fiction book you actually can't put down,"This was a great book. It focused on the cases that helped build the serial crime unit of the FBI and gave some insight into the basis for the breakdown of the social skills of serial killers. While some of the cases were more gruesome than others, it was interesting to see how they were similar and different from one another. This is a non-fiction book, which I don't normally read because I find them boring. But I couldn't put this one down. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 was because it didn't really have a story line that was clear. Having said that, I still read the entire thing in days."
4,It'll make you lock your doors and windows!,"This book is an excellent read for all you true-crime buffs out there. It's hard to believe that true-life monsters actually exist, but Mr. Douglas reveals them in all their depravity. This book will have you looking over your shoulder and it'll make you think twice before talking to strangers!"
1,Review for the book Mind Hunters,"I really expected something different. I thought it would be more on profiling and crimes,and was very disappointed when it was pretty much all about John Douglas's life story and never really spoke much on acual crimes. I did not enjoy the book at all. So unless you want to read a biography on John Douglas I wouldn't waste the time."
2,"Interesting Subject Matter, Annoying Storytelling","The book itself is not bad. Not great, but not bad. It provides some interesting facts about serial killers and the growth of the profiling unit of the FBI. However, Mr. Douglas' constant ""gee, I am so great"" references are very annoying to the reader. He seems to think he never made a mistake and that he can profile any criminal with about 3 pieces of information. As we all know now since the sniper case, profiling is very difficult, and takes a great deal of time, even if you are very good at it, as Mr. Douglas is.In short, if you can stomach Mr. Douglas' arrogance and self-aggrandizing style, you will find this book interesting. If you are like me though, his constant tooting of his own horn will dramatically reduce the quality of your experience."
3,Ego!,"Amazing look at the mind of serial criminals. But the biggest frustration is the constant use of ""I"", ""I"", ""I..."" John Douglas makes it seem like he was responsible for the creation of the world, Nixon's resignation and the end of the Cuban Missle Crisis. His narrative style is annoying, but filled with great insight. If he would show instead of telling and taking credit for all of it, it would be a much better book."
4,"A very good read, start to finish","John Douglas' book Mind Hunter is a quality read from start to finish. In this book Douglas explains how he gets inside the heads of some of the serial killers that he has helped track down. One thing Douglas makes sure to do is to give credit to the law enforcement officers that are actually investigating the cases. He takes no credit for finding these killers, he just provides a narrowed point of view for the detectives. Douglas makes the reader understand the anguish that the victim and the victim's families must go through. Not to mention the physical and mental toll it takes on the investigators.The stories he tells makes the book move along at a nice pace and he doesn't drag down the narrative with a lot of technical gibberish. He is quick and to the point. I suppose the credit for this should go to Mr. Olshaker instead.No matter who is responsible,Mind Hunter is an excellent read that you will find yourself re-reading over and over again."
5,If there were only more John Douglas's........,"Everyone keeps talking about his ego...well, if I could do what this man does...I'd surely have an ego problem too! He is great at what he does and deserves to think highly of himself. He catches the lowest of the low that walks this earth, so I think everyone should just except his greatness and read his books and enjoy them!!! I did! He is a wonderful writer, as well as a profiler! Besides...he helped catch the sick man that murdered an innocent Shari Faye Smith that lived no more than 15 minutes from me...Thanks Douglas!"
5,The title says it all.,"This is one of the best books on the subject. I do not mind the personal tidbits about the authors life, because this type of work at some point can get to you and by letting us into the minds of the killers he shows us the damage is not only to the victims and the victims family but to anyone the killer's life touches. Excellant read from a pro."
4,Frighteningly real look at the most dangerous killers,"This book tells the stories of some of the world's most horrifying serial killers. The only comfort in reading these gripping true stories is knowing that agents like the ""Mindhunter"" are working to stop the bad guys. This book not only presents the painful truth of what these killers have done, it also looks into their minds and the minds of those working to catch them, giving the reader a chilling look beyond what is covered in the headlines of such cases."
3,"Good info, poorly written, egomaniacal, name-dropping author","Overall I enjoyed the book. Chapters 1-4 are self praising and boring. I thought ""when is Douglas ever going to talk about profiling?"" Chapter 5 is where the book begins. Descriptions of the profiling process are interesting. Summaries of Douglas' professional experience are educational, such as: ""We would later realize that this childhood trait of cruelty to animals was the keystone of what came to be known as the 'homicidal triad,' also including enuresis, or bed-wetting, beyond the normally appropriate age and fire -starting."""
2,Ego Trip,"This book could have been a whole lot better if Mr. Douglas could have gotten over his enormous ego. I don't mean to undermind his fine work over the years or his dedication, but he wasted half the book patting himself on the back. I think he needs to get over himself and realize that he isn't the only one who solved these cases. It took a whole lot of hard working people and not just one loan FBI agent."
2,Save your money. Wish I did.,"I bought this book thinking I would learn how profiling really works and how it is used to solve crimes. All I found was John Douglas's ego, everywhere. He needs to check that by the roadside and stick to ""just the facts""."
2,"""Kind of a Drag!""","Serial killers are interesting; so is the search for them. John Douglas' personal life and childhood history are not. This title is spoiled by the interjection of Douglas' ego into every account of investigations in which he participated. Mr. Douglas' work is to be lauded; it speaks for itself. It's a pity he had to air his ego in print; otherwise, he would have written an interesting tome."
1,Not what I bargained for.....,"I read the reviews and read the summary and was very excited to read a graphic informative book on profiling. This book was awful. There was no detail or even a small piece of info. about any of his cases. I agree with previous reviews, he is too cocky. I can't imagine how many cases he has gotten wrong! I was exhausted by chapter two listening to this guys sad life. This is NOT a true crime book. It's a biography of someone feeling sorry for themself. I still have no idea how his cases were solved because he never said...."
2,"MIndhunter...John, dump your ego.","The book in itself, that is, when there was interesting facts about serial killers and how the FBI solves crimes, is actually very good and interesting. The parts of this book I truged through was Mr. Douglas and his ego tripping about dating and joking around though school etc. Certainely could have lived without that. Unfortunately, it took me a long time to finish this book as it did not hold my interest. I probably will not invest in another one of his books."
1,Mind Hunter,"The book takes way too long to get into the specific details of how the FBI's elite, interesting unit investigates and solves crimes. Instead, the author uses the book as a means of illustrating how much of an expert he is and goes into boring details of his upbringing, with unnecessary stories of how atheltic and tough he is. Again, I felt that he used this book with the main priority to promote himself."
3,almost what I was looking for,"I wanted to read a book that would describe the process of profiling, ie what clues at a crime scene lead profilers to target a certain type of person. The authors did this in a few cases which was great. However, often they just said (for example) suspect would have a red car. Then they would jump to when the suspect was caught and say yes he had a red car without saying how they arrived at that conclusion. I could do without all the ego and high school football reminences. If I wanted a bio of Douglas I would look for one. He does give credit to local law enforcement and only once comments negatively on a fellow FBI profiler."
4,Mind Hunter,For those people interested in criminal justice cases this is the book for you. Author John Douglas review some awesome momenst in his career that are mind blowing events about serial killers and crime.
1,finding compressor adapter is impossible,"Finding a compressor adapter to attach to AND HOLD compressor line in place is non-existant from what I can gather. Next I will buy a metal plug that already has the adapter as part of it. If you must stand and hold the compressor line in place, you can't go and monitor the water coming out of faucets, etc. For us newbees there should be instructions on the packaging stating that this plug is not made to hold a compressor line by itself. Very frustrating!"
5,Blow out your pipes,Inexpensive way to blow water from pipes in winter. Works for me and should pay for itself many times by reducing winter damaged plumbing.
5,Brake Fluid test strips,An interesting and novel idea to test for contaminated brake fluid. It worked just fine on the 3 cars I tried it on. 2 of them need the fluid flushed after finding the fluid bad.
4,"your a frightened woman toni ! nervous,lying a very bad risk","I purchased port of new york and liked it. It was about a drug smuggler who runs his operation through a new york yacht club. a young and talented yul Brenner plays the dapper drug lord who has custom agents richard rober and scott brady after him. the actor scott brady-who in real life is the actor lawrence tierneys younger brother- looks amazingly similar to actor ray liotta from goodfellas in this flick. The actress k.t. stevens plays yuls frightened wife who loves to be wealthy but is good at heart and doesn't want murder and blood on her hands.the poor girl ends up a ""very bad risk"" to yul as you will see if you watch this movie. I liked port of new york. It tells some of the story in documentary style so you can see how the treasury department and custom agents work. I reccommend this movie, especially if you like 1940's cops and robbers kind of action !"
3,A beginning Yul Brynner,"This action film is the demonstration of the methods used by federal authorities to curb the traffic of opium in the old days. It is interesting just as that : showing the methods to investigate a case and to solve it. The traffickers are of course immoral and do not hesitate to kill anyone in their way. It is also interesting to see a young Yul Brynner. He has a potential, so far unexploited. He will be a good actor later, even if he is over the average in this unambitious film.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
2,Where's The Rest Of It??,"I was so excited to get my volume, and immediately tried to look up my favorite bread pudding recipe (as remembered in my old falling-apart copy.) The index says it's on page 536, so imagine my surprise when I find that the first page in my new book is 738. My old book is all one volume, so I had no way of knowing that I was only ordering half a book. If anyone is interested in ordering this book, beware! Make sure that you are getting it all, either in one volume or that the two you order are Volume 1 and Volume 2. I was very, very disappointed, to say the least."
5,"Most Mind Blowing, Conceptual Destroying Book Available","Prior to Consciousness is set up as a number of interviews between Nisargadatta Maharaj and spiritual seekers from all over the world. These talks were given from the August of 1980 till just before Maharaj's death in September 1981. Through clear and simple words Maharaj tears away the false and leaves the reader with the pure state of one's own beingness. Nisargadatta's main advice is for one to stablize in the state of the ""I am,"" which is really one's only reference. Nisargadatta is similar in his approach as Ramana Maharshi, getting one to question the questioner. Freedom is yours to be had, you are free already; just get rid of all your notions of freedom. This is the most powerful book I have ever read and still continue to enjoy reading sections of it whenever I pick it up. If one is interested in Advaita this is a must."
3,not for beginners!,"this is not a 'beginner's guide to poetry'. this was my expectation, and i found the book too difficult to wade through. perhaps i will return to it, once i have a firmer grasp on the basics of poetry.also, the author's florid, overwrought, style grew quickly tiresome. his use of the word 'unbearable' to describe at least three separate poems (or parts of poems), for example...... please!"
1,"An overblown, self-centered performance.","A terrible book, especially for a newcomer to poetry. Blowsy prose, overheated rhetoric, vatic references to world poetry. I miss the excited responses of, e.g., Auden, Frost and Jarrell, to particular poems. An irritating habit of saying that some stanza ""reminds him"" of ten other poems, without discussing the others or even quoting them."
5,"Like an old glove, it gets better with age...","I tend to think of this book as I do my seasoned, battered first baseman's mitt, which accompanied me through eight seasons of championship Senior Mens' Hardball in the Northwest.As I grow older, I become more appreciative of Ed Hirsch's spiritual gift. It is no small feat to mentor well, especially in a field as suspicious as poetry, but Hirsch manages quite well, with no lies and no breaking of hands, with no disillusion or politicking. By sharing his passion and speaking honestly and humbly from his heart, he presents a compelling case for reading poetry, for reading at all for enjoyment, love, and salvation. It's a necessary book, and I wish I had written it myself. It is a superior substitute for extended, engaging conversation. I'm glad we have it, and that someone as capable as Ed Hirsch has made himself and his insights available to us.Robert McDowell, author of the forthcoming Poetry In Your Spiritual Practice"
4,"Good, but...","I got this book because I'm a complete novice who would like to learn to enjoy poetry. The book certainly put me on the right track, as it was inspiring more than anything else.My one gripe is that my biggest problem with poetry is that I simply don't understand much of it. Any time I pick up a poem, I will, sure as anything, hit a line or two (at least) I can't figure out, and then I lose interest in the poem. There is a skill to reading poetry and I don't have it yet. Hirsch at his best would pull a poem apart and explain his reading. However, many times he would quote a few lines and talk about how wonderful they were, without explaining what they meant to him, and I was clueless. It was fustrating to have a book that purports to explain poetry to novices assume I would understand something I didn't.That said, I understood about 75% of the book, thought it beautifully written, and am now looking for other introductions to move me along the path."
4,Rewarding But Inconsistent,"In his acknowledgments, Hirsch states that ""this book was conceived as a whole."" That's a little hard to believe; there is only a slight sense of overall organization to the volume. Readers might be better served by approaching this as a collection of separate but related essays in which Hirsch offers his interesting and perceptive thoughts on individual poems and on poetry as a genre. These essays do not offer any sort of step-by-step approach to reading poetry (as a reader might infer from the title), but by modelling his own readings of well-selected poems, Hirsch will both inspire and inform you. This is not a beginning-level book, but those with a modest knowledge of poetry will find this to be an enjoyable next step, and the glossary and reading list at the end are valuable resources."
3,Watch those dimensions!,"I am in the middle of making the Prairie Sofa based on Mr. Lang's dimensions. It has been a long haul. I followed his dimensions very closely and when I went to assemble the sides and back, I was not even close. This is bad. I would advise, if you are taking the books dimensions at face value, you should do your own calculations to make sure it is going to work.I have met Mr. Lang at a woodworking show in Ontario California. When I mentioned to him I was making a project from this book he had a look on his face like ""ok, give me the grief"". Well I didn't, as I was not far enough into the project to know better. It is a nice book for the inspiration to build, just be careful with the dimensions."
5,Good book for the woodworker,"I bought this book to learn how to make Stickley furniture. Good plans, well written and good illustrations. I finished several thousand dollars worth of furniture within."
2,"Goodbye, 50 Minutes","Africa Blood and Guts is Africa Addio with 50 of its 138 minutes cut out of it. The people responsible for Mondo Cane went into Africa in the 1960s to record the chaos that ensued after European colonialists began to withdraw after exploiting its people and resources for years. Africa Addio is still one of the most powerful and shocking documentaries ever made, and is still pertinent (those responsible for screwing up Iraq should take note of its lessons). Distributor Jerry Gross took the original film, stripped it of all its historical context and political savvy, and released what is basically just a gross-out film under the more sensational title ""Africa Blood and Guts"".Blue Underground has released the uncut Africa Addio in its uncut version as part of the Mondo Cane collection. Get that instead if you can."
2,"No Blood, No Guts. Only limited history.",This title is about the cultural and social! changes took place in Congo after civilized countries left the government to the local authority around 1960's. collected b&w; footage rather than a documentary.Not much blood or gore. Nothing about authentic african culture.
5,very good eclectus food,"Good clean, fresh specialty diet. Seed is clean, smells fresh out of every bag. No added filler or coloring. Kermit loves it!"
1,Not worth buying,"I am not sure why this book has received so many good reviews. The basic premise is that if you channel love into someone, good things will happen. So thats the gist of it."
5,A must have for every library!,"I rarely read a book more than once, but I read this book 3 times in 2 weeks. Three days after the first reading of this book and using the affimations I had a demonstration ( I won something I needed that was worth $57.00). I was flabergasted. I never win anything. There is also a really neat method in it you can use to solve all kinds of problems (relationship, financial, health etc). This method has brought inner change and growth in me. Buy this book. It will be the best 6 bucks you've ever spent. It has been for me. I highly recommend it."
5,Prospering Power of Love,This book is small and loaded with gems of valuable truth. A Unity minister and close friend of ours told us it was one of her favorite books. My husband who is an avid reader on many topics loves this book. It's a practcal way to achieve many of your dreams
5,After 48 Years - Chubby keeps rockin',"Chubby had his first hit in 1959, now another one in the Adult Charts.That's 48 years, must be some sort of record (excuse the pun). This is an outstanding set of recordings. The support artists on these recordings are truly outstanding, top recording & production. If you have never purchased a Chubby Checker record/cd make this the one. Check out Chubby's entire history. http://chubbychecker.hankfacer.com"
5,Way to go Chubby!,"I heard this song on SIRIUS channel 2 and fell in love with it! Even though its on my STILETTO.Chubby, you are the MAN again! Keep up the good tunes man."
2,Effective but low on features,"I bought this product because I was looking for a low-cost solution to some data-loss issues. I found that it is pretty effective at retrieving many deleted files, and does a better job than many other low-cost or free programs of this type. It even allows you to preview the files before restoring them. However, I am quite disappointed by the fact that the program cannot restore the original file and folder structures, or even the original names of the files themselves, which can create a great deal of confusion when it comes to sorting the restored files. Therefore, if these issues are of concern to you, I would recommend spending a bit more if necessary to buy software that provides these features."
1,never recieved it,"as far as I know, all spode is good....but I never recieved it...thank god I got the money back or i'd be up in arms....be weary."
5,Martini's at Christmas,These glasses made my Christmas party just that much more fun. We did a great Martini Bar and had Apple puckers....Beautiful in the glasses
2,Doesn't look like the picture,"bought this one a month ago, the packaging is great, the watch doesn't look like the picture, its golden plate is more like copper color which gives it a cheap look, i was getting it as a gift but retreated after i saw it, sad point i can't refund as i'm on Egypt now and the mailing fees will exceed its price"
1,Cheap Product which is over boasted,This is a very cheap product . Purchased it to gift someone close but hesitated in gifting it . Diamond collection is a very high descriptive word for this piece .Will not recommend to buy one even it comes for a lesser price even on a deal day
3,The Great Meadow,"This book is long and often superfluous. Simple concepts are explained in ever increasingly complex ways which seem to only be for the point of adding to page counts. There is a section of the book where he digresses into a theoretical concept of Native American lifestyles and resource usage only to conclude with saying that this is all what he thinks might have happened, but in all his research there is absolutely no proof to substantiate it. He digresses in this way quite often telling his preferred theoretical history then explaining that it is all made up and that there is no way to prove it. Overall it seems like the book was written as a weak argument against Cronon's Changes in the Land.The book would have been better with serious editing and presented in a scholarly journal rather than a book. While some of his facts are interesting and engaging, he lacks sufficient content and makes up for adding excessive and redundant wordiness to fill in the gaps."
3,production quality?,"Why don't they record in a studio? This band sounds interesting, creative and talented but I don't get the sound they are going for here. Sounds as if there playing loudly in a house while the recording equiptment is setup and recording in the garage (how unique!?). Ruining what would otherwise be a good thing. I'm willing to lend them the money to get a producer and a real studio."
2,Lento ...,"Aunque yo no soy una experta en la materia creo que a esta obra una buena edicion no le caeria de sobra,No cabe duda de que contiene buenisima informacion, retrata sus vivencias el señor dentro del grupo, pero desafortunadamente la manera en que esta escrito es muy dificil de leer,"
2,Small Screen and NO outside humidity indication,Setup was fairly easy with the base finding the remote quickly. I'm rating this a little lower because the screen is difficult to see in most light and the system does not have outside humidity which I overlooked while reviewing this product before buying. If this is not a feature you need then you could consider this unit.I do like the way the Oscar changes as the weather conditions outside change.
3,Loved this unit until it died,"I've had the unit for a lttle over a year and it was great. After a prolonged period of subfreezing weather, the transmitter stopped working even after a change of batteries . Too bad, loved the little guy."
3,Thermometer,I like this little guy but it is not as accurate as I would like. I had to manually reset it several times. Disappointed with the quality.
2,As Advertised,"I can't figure out how to work it. I live in an apartment and have found it useless to me. To me, it was a waste of money but maybe someone else would like it. The only thing I use it for now is to tell me the inside temp in my apt. Quality was fine, no complaints about that."
3,Incorrect Data,"I have tried several times and failed to correct the time that this gadget automatically set itself to once I placed the batteries in it. I am in the Central time zone but it insists on the Eastern time zone (US). Otherwise, it works fine and is quite informative. It doesn't always read the temperature correctly compared to the weather channel. (I have the sensor set outside the house in the backyard near the ground but not on it to prevent it from being peed on by my intrusive neighbor's dog so that may be why)"
4,Great little device.,"I needed a device to monitor the humidity in my house, and I chose this one because the little weather boy on the display made it a fun learning device for my young son. We check out his attire every morning and talk about the temperature. It's become the clock of reference to keep all the others in sync because it's always correct. The only thing I would change is to make changing the settings easier."
1,Disappointed!,"I was looking forward to getting my new weather station...but, was left disappointed by this one. The wireless transmitter is worthless, it will not work and I have never been able to get an outside temp reading, no matter how close i try to position it to the main unit. I can't begin to tell you how many times I have taken the batteries out and tried ""resetting"" it without success. I used the manual and website to trouble shoot it, but nothing worked. I would not recommend this product."
2,"Looked like fun, but it's pretty quirky.","To start with, the remote (outdoor) temperature sensor for this unit has never been accurate (outdoor temp. is too high). Beyond that, this unit worked pretty well for about 9 months, until I changed the batteries. With new batteries, the indoor temperature reads about 10 degrees too hot (when it's not reading 120-130 degrees indoors)."
5,Great unit.,"Have owned this since early December '08.Instructions are somewhat confusing but unit set up was almost 'automatic'.I am using regular alkaline batteries with absolutely no problems, even though temps. this winter have gone below zero (some have commented that regular alkaline batteries freeze and don't work. No such problem with mine).The unit has been flawless. Extremely accurate in all aspects; indoor and outdoor temp. and humidity.Highly recommended.(Note: I placed the transmitter in a sealed baggie and place it under outdoor deck away from rain and snow).Larry.."
5,Great Product!,"I got this for my fiance for christmas. He set it up Christmas day. He said it was very easy to set up and was really happy with it. The temperatures are very accurate and so is the time. Little suggestion, make sure you have this set at your time zone. It took us a while to figure that one out! All in all, he loves it and it works well!!"
3,weather station,"The unit stopped working after a couple weeks, although the company replaced it I did not care for the way I was treated. They really need to improve on there people skills. The new unit works okey but I wouldn't recommend it unless you have perfect vision. Hard to read and back lite is dim."
3,Outdoor Sensors Really not for the Outdoors,"After several weeks, the outdoor remote sensor became waterlogged and stopped working. The sensor has no rubber sealing to keep out the water like the ones from Oregon Scientific have. Note that the sensors do not support outdoor humidity (only indoors). I was pleased with the main unit. I tried contacting La Crosse numerous times to address the issue with the faulty sensor. After leaving several messages, I never heard back from them and had to return the unit to Amazon (which was very easy)."
2,Transmitter stopped working. Garbage,Like many others my transmitter stopped working after only 6 months. Tried all the normal fixes and noting. Ended up throwing it out. Save your money and don't buy this.
3,Quick,quick getting to me. thanks you beat 4 other packages that were ordered on the same day and one was placed as expedite.
2,Outside temp sensor quit after 1 year under my covered porch..,Temp works great indoors and outdoors. The weather guy is a little off sometimes. Worked great for a little over a year
5,Top Stuff,"This does what it says it will do! Weather boy a little over the top, otherwise one heck of a device!"
4,La Cross Technogy forecast Station The Oscar Outlook,I recieved my LaCross weather station and was very pleased how fast I got it. I set it up and can't believe how Oscar can predict the weather by just changing his outfit my wife enjoys it also.
4,Size Matters,"I like the unit so far but it is much smaller than I thought it would/should be! (I should have Checked the dimensions 1""x6""x4"") It just looks bigger in all of the pictures! I was hoping to be able to read it without my cheaters;-( won't be a problem for younger users."
4,"First one arrived broken, second one works well","My 7-year-old son wanted a new alarm clock and we settled on this one. The first one that arrived did not have a functioning temperature sensor, but it was quickly replaced by Amazon. We have had the second one for a few months now and it is working well. Very useful to know the time and the temperature."
5,My Husband love's this!,"Bought as a Christmas gift for my husband. And he loves it. He consults it several times a day. Large Screen with easy to read numbers. And watching Oscar change outfits everyday is kind of entertaining. And the unit gives so much information. At first, a little tricky to set up because it gives so much detail. You really do have to read the manual to know what each set of numbers means. But after a quick glance at the manual, everything becomes clear."
5,Wireless sun/moon forcast station,This is a really cool toy to have. Its fun to watch him change his clothes as per what the weather is going to do Its a really fun gift to get someone that has everything.
2,Would not purchase again.,To small. To much of the clock is used on the little man in the center. Would like to be able to see date and time side of weather station more clearly (larger).
2,Can't see indoor and outdoor temps at same time,"This product seemed to setup and work very simply. I like the look of the clock, though it is smaller than I had thought, but that is okay since it is really an alarm clock size. But once it was setup, I noticed that it only displayed indoor temperature and left outdoor blank. So I hit some buttons until I found the outdoor temp. But in order to see it, the indoor temp disappears. So I am only able to see one temp at a time, which is NOT what was displayed in any of their photos or on their user manual. If anyone can tell me how to display both temps at once without scrolling through menus, I will improve my review, but until then, it is a 2."
4,like it but not sure if it gives the right temp,i bought it to monitor temp in the house but there is discrepancy of 5 degrees between the thermostat and this station - not sure why and which one is more accurate.
3,Cute and clever,Not easy to set but seems to work once you finish with the time consuming and frustrating process of setting the values.
1,"Just doesnt work, poor customer support.","The receiver/clock works fine. Unfortunately, the temperature senser/transmitter does not. Despite doing the time consuming reset/restart routine (waiting 4 minutes after removing the batteries from both units and then pushing all the buttons at least ten times) several times, the two units never communicated. A TOLL call to customers support resulted in several voice mailboxes and then after ten minutes (good thing I don't pay long distance phone charges) you had to leave a voicemail and then it hung up.Several calls later, a real tech support specialist told me that I need to buy batteries with an expiration date of at least 2015!OK, you've made enough of a fool of me can I return it for replacement or repair? - Sure at my cost.NOT!"
1,nice features but unreliable,"My main issue is that the outdoor sensor is unreliable. It works after initial setup, but within a few hours the indoor receiver will lose the outdoor temperature. For me, that's a deal breaker since outdoor temp is the main reason for purchasing this.It is full featured for the price, and the 'what to wear' guy is a cool feature. It would be a great value if it all functioned properly.The contrast on the screen is also not as good as some other lcd weather stations, it's somewhat dim . Even when you press the lighting bar, its still not as readable as other lcds with lighter backgrounds."
2,weather station,"I purchased this for my husband's father's day gift after he saw a similar product in someone's home. I chose this one because I thought the man who's clothes change with the weather was adorable. I should have listened to the other reviewers and not let my desire for cuteness overide buying a product that works. It was VERY hard to set up and no matter where we put the outdoor sensor, it NEVER is close to showing the correct temperature. Buy something else!!!!!!"
3,Not what we expected...,"I got this for my 5 year old son. My thought was he could see how to dress for the day based on the picture. I knew it would not be perfect but i figured it would provide guidance.Well, the first one lasted only a few months and it stopped receiving the signal from the remote sensor. LaCrosse replaced it free of charge which was good. The 2nd is now a few months old and it's working fine.My only real problem with this is that it's sooooooo small.I guess, i didn't expect it to be the size of a 4x6 picture frame. IT would be so much better if this were a large 8x10 or 12x16... a full size. Something you could see from across the room vs. having to get close.So, it looks cool, but it's super small. I would not buy this again."
2,Dead!,"Lasted 30 days. Transmiter was under deck, protected from rain and snow. Was cool to it failed. Working on a replacement."
3,"Sunrise/sunset times are wrong for Boston, MA","I got the weather station a couple of days ago and it works fine except for the fact that the sunrise/sunset times are off by an hour when you use the Boston settings. The Concord, NH settings are accurate and within a couple of minutes of Boston's. However, as I planned to give it as a gift, this glitch kind of takes the shine off this apple.If you're not around Boston, then obviously this particular problem isn't an issue. However, if there is one error in the database, there may well be others.I randomly tried a half dozen other locations and compared the data to the US Naval Observatory (USNO) site, and they all were all within a minute or two of the USNO. If you get one, I'd suggest that you make sure your sunrise/sunset times are correct for your city/airport code. The USNO site can be found at http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/RS_OneDay.php"
5,Cool!,What a fun gadgit to have in the kitchen. I'm always yelling a 'weather update' to the family. Of which I am SURE they appreciate.
4,WEATHER STATION,GREAT PRODUCT. WORKS WELL. EASY TO USE AND SET UP. VERY ACCURATE. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.NOT GOOD FOR THE VISUALLY IMPARED. A BIT SMALL.
4,Nice little weather station,"My wife was very happy to be able to know the outdoor temp at a glance. Oscar Outlook is a nice touch. It was a little strange that they didn't have the sunrise/sunset information for a major metropolitan area like Minneapolis/St. Paul but they had two other smaller Minnesota cities. The setup is a little cumbersome, but not too difficult. Otherwise it seems to work great so far (one month)."
4,works great,"recieved this item about two weeks ago(i bought two)and am very pleased overall.one problem-a little hard to see,even with back lite.took a while to set up-a ""hair puller"",but works great."
1,"LCD faded out after 4 month, support non-exist",It worked in the beginning. 4 months later the LCD was dead and all text were invisible. Changed battery per the manual and no way to bring the LCD text back. It's useless now. Contact La Crosse and their phone will be never pciked by a support representative. Left phone message and sent email and nobody contacted me for a month. It sucks. I had two other La Crosse products. Luckily they worked fine.
3,hit & miss,"bought 2 of these. one worked perfectly other not so well, but was very easy to get another sent and return the one that didn't. have 2 that work great now."
2,disappointed,"We were very disappointed in this station. The digits can't be seen unless you are just two feet from it. We have and wanted another station that can be seen 5-6 feet away. This station offers an alarm, snooze etc. too many buttons. You can't pick it up without pushing one of the 5 buttons around the face. I wish I would have sent it back."
1,Never worked,I never was able to get this item to work even after reading and following the company's recommendations. Thankfully the company accepted a return.I found a cheap one at a big box store that's been working great.
2,Lacrosse,I can`t get the outdoor sensor to work.I went online and printed off the manual. I`m gonna keep working with it to try to get it to work before Christmas. I bought it as a Christmas gift.Pat
3,Had three before,I just hope this one lasts at least longer than the last one did one year. This is the fourth one i purchased and if it does not last longer than one year it will be the last one i purchase.
3,Very small. Not suitable for a wall unit.,"This will work OK on a desk, but is hard to read from anything but a short distance. The price seems to be competitive."
1,La Crosse Forcast Station,"I did not pay close enough attention to the product details because it is tiny - only 5 inches long and 3 1/2 inches tall.Also, the directions are prohibitive - very detailed and plenty of places in the process that you can mess up and have to start all over again. I almost decided to just skip the whole thing.It appears to be working, but I would not recommend this product."
3,It's small,"It works fine, but it's much smaller than I expected. Read the specs carefully! Being a geezer, the small display is an issue. The goofball image in the center doesn't help me much. Its dress is suppose to tell you the weather conditions."
4,Fun item. Useful.,"I love this little guy. It is so convenient to wake in the morning and see the time, date (hey - pre coffee I need a reminder!), and outdoor temperature. I really bought it because I have a senior dog that can't breathe well if the humidity level in the room is too low. Dry heat bothers him so it was my desire to keep track of the humidity level and ensure I use a humidifier when necessary. NOTE: if you live by the water, the OUTDOOR humidity will actually trick the little man. He'll carry an umbrella but there actually will be no rain. haha. Otherwise it works great!! It's also wonderful to have a true reading of the indoor temp. Never did trust the A/C monitor. I would highly recommend the item."
1,big disappointment,"I have been wanting to get a wireless forecast station for a long time and finally broke down and bought one.Right from the beginning it never set right and I tried a couple of times. The sunset/sunrise is off by an hour and the barometer is only right about half the time. After a couple of weeks the outside temperature stopped working, which was the part I wanted it the most for to begin with. After reading more reviews I realized that I am not the only one that has had the transmitter die shortly after purchase and they only warranty for 1 month, after that you are SOL. You would have to pay shipping both ways and only get a partial refund! Would be cheaper to buy a new one from a better company. I buy everything from Amazon and am usually very satisfied, not this time!!! Totally disappointed!! Do yourself a favor and stay away from this brand!!!"
4,Atomic Clock and Weather,Pleased with the unit overall except the back light is very poor for night reading. The light would be Ok if on both the left and right side vs. just the right so you can't make out the clock side which is where one needs it most.
4,Good info but small in size,The info displayed on this weather station provides a good overview but the small size of the unit makes it hard to read.
2,Frustrating to use,"We got this as a gift from my parents. It worked until we had to change batteries. I have been trying for the past week to make the base ""sense"" the outside sensor. Every time I have to take the batteries off from both the base and the sensor, wait for 10 minutes, then put the batteries in the sensor first, then in the base without touching any buttons (and they seem to be everywhere!); otherwise, you'll have to start from the beginning. AArrgghhh, I'm thinking of tossing this. If setup or changing batteries takes half an hour, the product isn't worth it."
1,Never buy from Lacrosse Technologies...,"Absolutely horrible customer service. They don't back up their producty. Waited an hour for support, then they all they suggested was to ship back parts...at my own expense. They do NOT back up their product. I will never buy from them again."
2,La Crosse WS-9611U-IT-CBP,Dissapointed by it's small size. Operates fine although somewhat difficult to set up at first. Instructions are confusing. Too many functions and readouts. You need to have this unit close to you on a desk or such and even with the contrast adjusted to highest setting the sun or bright light can wash out or make seeing the numbers difficult. Too much information in too small of a package.
2,Why did they omit Wisconsin's two largest cities in the sunrise/sunset feature?,"I ordered this specifically because it had the sunrise/sunset feature. Description states 99 cities included. Great I figure it has to have either Milwaukee (metro population 1.5 million) or Madison (metro population of 300,000). Instead the only two cities they cover in Wisconsin are Green Bay and LaCrosse. It makes no sense to include those 2 cities but not Milwaukee or Madison. Both cities are over 200 miles from me. Just to warn other would-be buyers.. do not assume a city near you will be included in the 99 cities they list.Other than that it seems ok for the price. The manual is a little difficult to understand and the programming is not intuitive."
1,Poor choice,"I purchased the weather station and 2 additional remotes giving 4 different temp readings. When placed side by side none agreed with each other. The range is also not as advertised. The unit often loses contact with the remote in the garage, about 40 feet away. The display is a bit silly, what is the use of a decimal point reading for temp when it isn't accurate within 2 degrees (or maybe more) and lastly, who on earth would define the date October 10th as 1110?"
1,Nice Product; Bad company,"Product works ok. Neat idea. Poor wireless range.Unfortunately I had to call for Tech support. Left 2 voice mails in two days after waiting on hold for a few minutes. They won't let you remain on hold. I did not receive a call back so I called again and chose a different call path which got me to a person somewhere in Tech support. She was rude, short, and condecending. Probably hated her job or perhaps it was just a bad day. Regardless, I will not purchase another La Crosse product."
2,not worth it,"I got this for christmas last year & we've had random issues with it the whole time like the alarm having spaz attacks at 3am when it says its off, the time is NEVER right. The most recent is that we moved and when we took this to the new house it stopped reading the outdoor temp. I've changed the batteries & reset it a bunch of times but it still won't work. I can't find the instruction book anywhere and therefore I can't call the company. Apparently after less than a year of use I'm going to have to buy a new one. Not impressed. My husband wanted to get a different one because of the reviews on this one and I told him ""it can't be that bad""...it is that bad...don't do it!"
1,No Customer Service,"I ordered this despite the reviews complaining of no Customer Service by Lacrosse. I have another product by them and it works fine, so I took the plunge. Unfortunately, there is an issue with the item (surise/set incorrect). I e-mailed them a week ago, and received an auto-responder reply. Nothing else. I e-mailed again. Nothing. Back it goes."
5,Works as advertised w/ lots of functionality,"Summary: Nice, right-sized unit to keep you updated on a variety of data points.Details:Pluses:- Easy to set up. I read the directions afterwords and found out about a few more features, but had it all set up right.- I really like all the features. The kids like the little guy w/ the different uniforms. I found him corny, but useful.- Displays both local and satellite info.- Countertop display stand works well.Issues:- Wall mount doesn't work well. It works, but there is only one point to hang it from so it can get bumped and the mounting hole is not flush w/ the back, it's recessed."
1,Save yourself the aggrivation,Bad Bad product. Waste of $$. Company not helpful in working with U to get it working. Major run around from Customer Service who don't know their product. I bought the second sensor because I couldn't get the one that came with it to work. Customer Service said I would probably need an additional sensor. Stupid me. I fell for it. Still can't get any of the units to work. They keep telling you to take the batteries out and go through this elaborate process to install it. TOTAL waste of time. Don't buy it or any other product from this company. Save yourself the aggrivation.
4,WS-9611U,"Unit it a little on the small size, but works great, probably better than our local weather man. If it shows the boy in rain gear it is raining ,wes raining, or is going to rain. Temperature is correct, humidity is very accurate.Love it."
3,"Cute, but loses accuracy",I bought this as a gift and really like the idea of it. At first the temperature was pretty accurate but after 6 months the temperature is unreliable.
4,La Crosse Tech and Our New Little Man,Though basic set up was a little confusing and time consuming it all worked out great. My wife loves to look and see just what the Little Man is wearing in the morning before she starts the day. The readout is clear and easy to read and you can't beat Amazon Customer service. They went the extra mile to get this product to us as promissed.
4,Super!,"This clock/weather station is perfect when I have to figure out what to wear in the morning as well as getting ready for my run for outside. Gives me an accurate reading outdoors, and the cartoon man ""dresses up"" for the current weather conditions (e.g., holds an umbrella and wears a rain coat if it's raining, scarf blowing if it's windy etc.). The display is large so I don't need to put on my glasses to read it. I have the sensor on my deck in the back yard, so the range is good. The only thing I did notice is that in order to sync the sensor with the display, it's best to do it next to a large window, such as a sliding glass door or even outside. But once, I had them sync'd, I was able to take the display anywhere in the house and still receive a signal."
5,LaCross Tech Sun/Moon Forecast Station,Bought as a gift for a golfer who checks the weather before playing ... a real success! Thanks!
5,Accurate,"Was looking for a weather station with temperature, barometer and humidity and this fit the bill. Thought the man with various outfits was corny, but it has proven to be relatively accurate and gives you a quick indication of the direction the barometer is heading."
2,Almost a good product,"I buy things with the expectation they're going to keep working.After one year of marvelous service, the thing crapped out.Month 13: the humidity sensor crapped outMonth 14: the wireless transmitter appeared to lose range, then totally died (yes, I followed the instructions for battery replacement on both units)Month 15: indoor thermometer hit the skids, reading 135 degrees, then ""OF""So, for one year this thing made me quite happy, even with a little character to briefly entertain my kids each morning.After that year, this thing is a skipping stone.I had no expectations for customer service, assuming any warranty on the device was less than 12 months... But I was pleased to find that I could still get a PDF of the user manual online. To me, that's a credit to Lacrosse. Manufacturing a short-lived product goes to their discredit."
1,Disappointed,"Outdoor temperature reading did not work, and unit is too small. Hard to read display on unit. Would not recommend, better to get a unit that is much larger."
3,Too small,"It works great! BUT it's too small. It fits in the palm of your hand, very hard to see numbers if you hang it on your wall or far away. it's more appropiate for a desk. I thought it was gonna be bigger, and I couldn't find the measurements on description."
3,It's ok,Works ok sometimes but then other times it doesn't read correctly even when following the directions correctly. It's ok for now
5,Weather station,"This weather forcast station is exactly what i wanted. I am very interested in the outdoor weather, especially, and this meets my interest perfectly. I would heartily recommend this weather station to anyone interested in keeping an eye on the weather."
5,excellent product. this swiss sensor is very accurate!,"I got 3 of this item at $14.99 when Amazon big sale on this.Before I bought this, I carefully surveyed .. all amazone review.. La Crosse website etc...This Swiss made sensor is very accurate as I expected.Also, the outdoor sensor unit also very good working and sensor signal very good!"
4,La Crosse Technology WS-9611U,This has been a good product thus far. The only thing that seems a little amiss so far is weather boy's predicion of rain. Sometimes his prediction is the direct opposite of what's happening outside at the current time and per the weather forecast.Otherwise this is a good product for what it is. I really like the indoor humidity reading so I know how to water some of the indoor plants.
4,Just to add my couple of cents,"There are plenty of reviews for this item but to add my comments, this has to be a steal at the current Amazon price of $20. Works as advertised. No problem with the unit picking up the outside sensor something of which I have trouble with some previous units. I particularly enjoy watching the length of day change as it is now over ten hours compared to just under nine around Christmas. The biggest drawback is the display could be better. You really do need to be looking straight on it or the LCD units get kind of shadowy looking and fade, not that it's unreadable. For this price, I think I'll buy two more for gifts and get the free super saver shipping."
4,Weather channel weather station,"Item was exactly as described and it is fun to see how the ""weather boy"" is dressing for the day's events. I bought it for my husband as he lives and breathes the weather channel. He loves the 15 day forecast.highly recommend."
4,La Crosse SW-961U Weather Station,"This unit was very easy to set up and has a good visual display. It gives you everything you need to know about inside/outside temp and weather. I bought this for an elderly person but the display is a little too busy for him and he has to study it a while to figure out what he is looking at. He also has a problem when picking it up, he hits the buttons on the side and can't figure out how to get back to where he started. For the average person though it is very good. One of the pluses is that it can work with two outdoor sensors and they are selectable so you could have one in the shade and one in the sun. one minus is that the outdoor sensor is very sensitive to being in the sun which gives you a much warmer reading that actual. I had to put a cup over the sensor to give it shade so it reads correctly. Other than that I really like this unit."
1,Poorly designed & quality,I bought this weather center about 6 weeks ago. It is a cheap junky product. Every time we touch it we inadvertanly touch one of the poorly placed set buttons(exposed on the side of the unit) and the display changes and the outdoor temp goes away. I'm really sorry we wasted our money on this junk!
1,"Have hours to spare making it work? This is for you, then.","It took a couple of hours to set this up the first time. If you read the manual and add up the time expected to wait for things to happen, this is normal.Try using the alarm, if you dare. I figured it out, but it is not easy.Change the batteries? Start from square 1.Don't buy La Crosse products."
2,Great product but unreliable,Mine kicked the bucket withing a year. The temperature readings became wildly inaccurate. It currently claims that the temperature is 115 when it is more like 75.
2,Disappointed,I have had the weather station for about 6 weeks and the outdoor temperature sensor has died. It was in a sheltered area and I have done everything to get it to work. Now I'm dealing with LaCrosse customer service. After reading reviews for the temperature sensor (TX29U-IT) this is very common.I do not recommend this weather station.
1,Save your money!!!,I just ordered this item in July and it has stopped working already! It started out by giving false readings that weren't even close to the right temps. Now it doesn't even register the indoor temp. at all.This is the second weather station that I have had from this company and I haven't had one that works. The first one I purchased a few years ago didn't work from day one. I thought that they might have improved them since the first one I purchased but I guess I was wrong. Save your money and don't purchase items from this company!!!
2,...if it only worked.,"This seems like a great product. However, I cannot get the remote sensor to connect to the main unit. Have tried at least 20 times, if not more, leaving it to do it's thing for over a day at times. Nothing. I have tried customer support many times and have left two messages. They finally did call me back...during the day when I was at work. No help at all.I regret this purchase. I might just return it and spend some more cash on a better product.edit: After several months of trying I finally did get through to Tech support. After convincing them that I had already done all of their recommended 'fixes' for my issue they determined that my remote sensor was bad. I received the new one in a matter of days and it worked INSTANTLY. It has been on for some months now and I love it. It used to lose signal from time to time but I changed the batteries and have had no problems since.If you can risk the problems I had then I say go for it. Otherwise, save up and get a sure thing."
1,let down,This is no more then a outdoor therm. It has a humidity gage but it's for the inside not the outside?? It has been raining off and on all weekend and the guy does not have his umbrella out? And last of all it's hard to read from 5 feet! I would not recommend it sorry!
2,Fair,I had no trouble setting this up or anything and it usually works good but I live in Florida and bought this to see how miserably hot it is outside and when it gets over about 85 degrees it goes crazy and will say its 103 or 108 outside. I have it under an overhang so its not in direct sunlight. I have put other thermometers outside next to it and they give the right temp. I guess as long as it never goes over 80 degrees it's great.
2,Poor history of accurate...doesn't receive weather signal,"I got product in hopes of not having to go online every morning and seeing what the days high and low temp. would be BUT the product has its own sensors that it uses to show weather temps and so far has a poor track record. I assumed the radio signal it received was for todays weather condition but the signal is for only auto clock setting and the time of todays sunrise and sunset which is a nice feature for daily walks. The prediction problem could be due to weather changes from global warming or just the local weather of where I'm at but I would not recommend product if you live in San Antonio, TX"
1,Don't waste your money.,Now I know why it was so cheap. It IS NOT compatible with my PSP 3000 even though the box said it was. I couldn't dock the unit in it because the peg that plugs into the headset port does not line up. Don't waste your money!
1,Avery Clear Label Dividers,"I bought these dividers, a very large amount of them for a business. They are marketed as reuseable. They DO NOT sell the labels seperately. Nor do they make labels close to the same size. So, when you buy these thinking you can reuse them, be prepared to not be able to get new labels once the 2 pages that they give you with the pack of 5 sets runs out. Had I known this, I would never have purchased all of these dividers. At almost $40.00 for a pack of 5 sets, what a waste. I was told by a rep at Avery that in order to get more labels, you need to buy more dividers! No thanks."
2,Packaging was horrible,I've ordered these bag before no problem. Everything was in bundles making it easy to count and store. This time it came in a giant box with all the bags loose floating around. How am I going to store this huge box. Also how do I know if I have the proper amount of bags. This order sucks.
3,Wow was it ever an eighties flick!,"I have loved Corey ever since I can remember, and have collected most of his movies. I have over 23 so far on vhs. This was definately a cherry. The plot is just Corey telling stories, and talking about himself. The locations that he choses are somewhat chessy, and there is definately some gratuitous bare chested shots, but all in all it is worth it for die-hard Corey Haim fans. I haven't found it for sale at any stores, but e-bay has it up for sale every once in a while. Hope this helps guys!"
4,User friendly,"I've been using this text for the last 4 years with intermediate ESL students. The exercises and their instructions are easy to understand, nicely sequenced, and allow for a measure of creative writing that the students can enjoy. There should be an accompanying answer booklet to help negate any student protests to the teacher's answer choices. However, that said it is a very easy writing series for ESL teachers short on preparation time."
5,These guys are in a class by themselves!!!! 5 STARS for sure,Randy and the gang take you there and back. Rock the way it was meant to be heard. You need to see and hear them to appreciate them...
3,Wayne Gretzky,I'm writing about the book I read in Social Studies. This book was farly good. This book talked about Wayne's life. It said that when he was a little kid he moved to Toronto to get away from all the paretens who's kids were mad that he was always scoring. At a young age Wayne played hockey with his grandmother. Wayne was also great as a young boy. Wayne was 18 years old when he started to play hockey in the NHL. Wayne has 40 Reular season records. Wayne played for 4 different teams. Wayne Gretzky is the greats or one of the greats. I think that if you like sports you should read this book.
1,I wanted eggnog liquid- not custard.,This recipe made a custard and I was looking for the drink. I was dissapointed at the mislabeling of it.
5,like peanut butter on the moon,"CowabungaggHHHH. 'Dis here platter is it! I'ma long time Haze fan and hafta admit that his recent output can be circumspect but hold the phone Mildred cuz cousin Hasil has done it agin'! Well, close enuff as this here wax izza compilation of trax spanning five decades and all concern chicken. Chicken! A concept album about chicken! Take THAT 2112! The liner notes and pix are great because the good folks at Norton care about the Haze and the 21st century and the Haze's contribution to it. Yep. This is the perfect ceedee for any barbeque, oil change or bris. Its even got the demo version of Chicken Walk; served RAW! Mmmm. This would be a good place to start or to add to your Haze collection, sure 'nuff. Git it!"
4,We'll miss you Haze,"There are few figures in American music that can be called true originals. Hasil Adkins, folks, is a true original. There isn't a single soul who sounds like him. And despite the frequently odd subject of his songs (the whole album is about chickens), he sings with much conviction, trying as hard as he can to make you take what he is saying seriously. He is a one-man band who plays acoustic guitar and a drum peddle at the same time, which makes him unique enough. But his subject matter is what truly pushes him over the edge. On previous albums, he explored decapitation and eating penut butter on the moon. On this album, he devotes his entire set to out fine feathered freinds, the chicken. And, he was around for about fifty years, not until recently we lost him. RIP Hasil Adkins, a true american original (1937 - 2005)."
4,photography and history,"I was attracted to this mesmerizing novel by its meditations on 19th century photography, Victorian middle-class hypocrisy and the Crimean War. Photography binds this brief novel together and Bainbridge revels in its historical and metaphorical possibilities. She organizes her chapters around photographs, which makes the reader immediately aware that she/he is to infer meaning from this practice and speculate on the role of photography in determing what and how we see and remember. Bainbridge is very sensitive to and aware of 19th century photography: its use during the Crimean War (the first war that photographs were taken of), connection to both science and magic, and the practice of post-mortem photography. The reader does have to work to explore the themes suggested by the author, but her historical grounding, lucid prose and rich subject make the effort worthwhile."
3,An elegantly written but uninvolving story,"The writing is first rate, deft, spare, elegant and it is quite good enough to pull you through the book. It is a short book, after all. I would fault Ms. Bainbridge, though, for the confusing similarity of the narrative voice for the three narrators. It makes the book unnecessarily hard to follow.My biggest problem is with the title character, George Hardy: he is by turns arrogant, cold-as-a-fish, pissy, condescending, bloodlessly asexual. The narrators' devotion to him is hard to fathom and one's lack of identification with him renders the book uninvolving.Another problem: this is not a book to read if you are looking to find out something about the Crimean War, as I was. The book is very elliptical as regards its historical subject and I found this frustrating. If you are planning to read the book and are not familiar with the facts and background of the Crimean conflict I would suggest some preliminary research."
2,LIFE SEEN THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY,"It's difficult to know quite where to begin here, in the face of such overwhelming praise from so many satisfied readers. It's not that it's badly written, just that it fails to illuminate Master Georgie's life. That after all should be its purpose, particularly where, as here, that person existed and at least one of the events described took place. The author is content to conjure up others to act as prisms, which would be a useful literary device if they illuminated the central figure, but instead we see him through a glass darkly. I may be in a minority of one, but it failed to live up to my expectations."
3,Intriguing but Incomplete,"When I read a novel, I want to really get to know the main characters. Having just finished the last page of this book, I can't say that I know Master Georgie well at all. He remains a rather shadowy presence throughout. Two other crucial characters presented in the story ( Myrtle and Dr. Potter) are like jigsaw puzzles with too many pieces still missing at the close of the book. I was intrigued by this puzzle, but came away annoyingly unsatisfied."
3,ugh...I think I'll skip dinner.,"I found this a very disturbing book of the type that you like against your own best instincts. I'm not saying it's bad, no. I'm just saying that if you want a nice, friendly, romantic (within reason) war book, look somewhere else. Children shouldn't read this, but it's good. Forgive me if I'm making no sense, but this is a very tricky book to review."
2,utterly unengaging and boring,I finished this book as fast as I could. I felt the author was on another wavelength to the reader. I didn't care that the story was about this Georgie fellow. He seemed peripheral and the written perspective on him oblique. The writing was good and I may try some other of the authors works but the plot was feeble. Try Pat McCabe's breakfast on Pluto for energy and a raw story or Ian McEwan's Amsterdam for a page turner with a plot of some interest. Thumbs down for this one.
2,"do not ""fit securely""","I ordered these for metatarsal pain and they do not ""fit securely"" as the description says. They always slide out from under my foot while I'm wearing them. Maybe if I only wore really tight shoes it would be fine. They didn't really have much cushioning, either - they're just a piece of rubber with some raised circles on them. Not sure why they are called ""Gel"" Ball of Foot Cushion.I also purchased theFootSmart Metatarsal Sleeveand that was what I needed."
5,NEW WICKS,"The new X shaped wooden wicks in the Woodwick candles are easier to light, burn more evenly, stay lit and are easy to re-light. This is an improvement over some of the Woodwick candles I have had that utilized the old style single slice of wood wick. I must say that the old wicks did look a lot more rustic and natural, both while burning and when not burning. Progress at a price.But, at least the crackling sound is better than ever and more consistant.In this particular candle,the scent is very light and pleasant.Follow directions and keep your wick trimmed."
3,Great except for the sound,"The candle comes in a beautiful jar with a wooden lid. I really like the vanilla bean scent. When lit, it's supposed to make a crackling sound like a fire, but it makes more of a buzzing noise. It's annoying at first, but I seem to be able to drown it out. It the candle didn't have the sound or if it sounded better, I would have rated it much higher."
2,Doesn't smell like vanilla bean to me.,"For how expensive these candles can be, they sure don't smell as good as other brands. I received this as a birthday gift and was disappointed because it smells nothing like vanilla bean. I think that the wood wick and the crackle sound is interesting and calming, but the smell is the exact opposite. Rather than smelling simply like vanilla, Woodwick puts other, nature-like scents in their candles that makes them smell terrible. Won't be buying again."
1,Too narrow for little feet,"I bought this for my son who is not chubby. After several attempts, I still could not fit his foot in. I had to throw them away :("
3,why this is best home remodel film,"this endeavor full of hope and excitment which quickly turns into a nightmare has been handled in other films but for some reason this is the most palatable yet portraying the horrors of contractors, construction, and oooopsys I have come across... everyone soooo affable, money is truly no object and everyone just laughs off no windows, furniture, etc., and WHO GETS SIX MONTHS to write a silly slogan, that's amazing even by Mad Men standards.... guess I just enjoy Myrna and Cary and they make you think this can actually be such a wonderful bonding experience and the maid will always come through to save the day!"
5,Great old movie,"Great movie, for all ages, when you want to look back and not feel any stress, watch this one."
3,Good movie,"Yes, it is a bit dated and boring at times, but it is overall a good movie and worth having seen one time."
1,Wrong region for US players,This dvd has the wrong region for the US so it won't play in our players. I did not know there was a difference in DVD's. I didn't know it was coming from a different country.
2,Mr. Blandings Is a Miss,"I'm an ""old movie buff"" and I find this to be a pretty awful movie. It's really full of the most simple-minded dialogue. See these great actors in something that's a little less polemical. The writers' social conservatism just jumps off the screen. You could use this for a Media Studies film to contrast with an ""old film"" from the same time that shows people living with much more self-awareness. Two stars only for the bright young daughters - great actresses!"
2,What a Waste of Talent,"Take a thin book to start, add two world class talents mix in a screewriter and director who clearly never built a house and you get this mess. The book was amusing and wry but the movie could never figure out what it wanted to be. The screenwriter's additions just made no sense; Bill Cole the lawyer as a love interest, (unbelieveable next to Cary Grant), a struggle to meet an ad deadline (with a racist ending that's painful to watch in the 21st century.) All these point to a group of people who didn't believe that the core story had legs, and went on to embelish it with distractions. If there was ever a movie designed by committee this was it."
1,Bleh...,"I love Cary Grant, and I love a good black and white. I hate this movie it is soooooooooooooo borning... but maybe that is just because I am a part of the younger generation that demands unreasonable things from movies. This movie drags and drags and drags.This movie is not nearly as good as so many other cary Grant films ( especially bringing up baby, philedelphia story, arsnic and old lace, and charade)"
1,-- Wretched! --,"Look at it right side up, turned upside down, from the left side, from the right, or from the backside Ñ it will not matter! This film is irredeemably awful."
5,Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House,Love this old Cary Grant and Myna Loy movie. It is one of the funnest movies in the world.....and so true. Thanks for the prompt and courteous service. Looking forward to more purchases with you.
5,great movie,a great and funny movie if you like oldies but goodies and if you or someone you know is building a house
5,Mr. Blandings--a winner,"One of hollywood's vintage best!Funny, charming(with Cary grant and Myrna Loy how could it miss!) and altogether entertaining.If you're looking for a perfect way to spend a relaxing evening, this is one you will enjoy!"
5,Classic homebuilding comedy!,"Anyone who has ever bought, remodeled or built a family home will appreciate their own experience better after seeing what Mr. & Mrs. Blandings went through to get their dream house."
5,So funny and So true,"This is a wonderful classic comedy with superb performances from everyone in the cast, kids included. Anyone who has EVER bought a home, much less built one, can relate to this great story. I smiled, grinned and laughed out loud from start to finish. Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas are perfectly cast. The DVD was in excellent condition and is a winner all the way."
4,A good old movie,"This movie was pretty good. Not as funny as Arsenic and Old Lace or Bringing Up Baby, but worth watching, especially if you are a Cary Grant fan."
3,Charming,"A charming story that is slow for today's sensibilities. Delightful, as so are Cary Grant and Myrna Loy. A once or twice view. Great for builders or decorators, as it shows how your dream house can blown into a big headache!!!"
5,Hysterical!,"After going through a little ""room addition"" in our home, there were MANY things we could relate to in this movie! ""Bicker! Bicker! Bicker!"" A good old fashioned, fun, funny, flick!"
4,Wood Shed,Anyone who would put Shelly Long and Tom Hanks on the same planet as Loy and Grant should be taken to the wood shed for rethinking.This film is nuance and fun throughout..with Melvin Douglas and Emory Parnell and even Lex Barker and watch for Harry Shannon as the well driver Fun.
2,Crazy Sound,"Love this old movie but was dissapointed in the quality of the DVD. The sound continuously changed from loud to soft for no reason. I had to constantly adjust the volume throughout the movie. Then, there was the ""blackouts."" Several places just went black for a few seconds. Maybe there was a problem with the master, I don't know but it was annoying."
5,Love this move,Waited fore very to get it on DVD was the last movie in my collection still on VHS.Great family movie.
4,Why hasn't Hollywood remade THIS movie?,"If you've ever had a house built, helped build a house or worked in real estate, this is the movie for you! There are so many clever jokes that have stood the test of time, that I can watch this film over and over and still snicker. The fact that it's 65 years old and in b/w turns a lot of people off, I'm sure. Hey Hollywood: instead of Saw XXVIII or a re-re-re-boot of the Green Lantern, why don't you remake this classic?"
2,Poor quality video; kept stopping.,"I like Cary Grant, but this movie was kind of silly. However, the worst part is that it kept stopping. When I would try to restart it I had to start back at the beginning each time. I couldn't resume where I left off, and I could only fast forward in 10 seconds intervals. I finally gave up after about 30 minutes of this struggle."
5,FUNNY FUNNY,I HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE PROBABLY 20 TIMES IN MY LIFE AND I HAVE THE ORIGINAL BOOK. I JUST HAD TO OWN MY OWN DVD COPY. I KNOW I WILL ENJOY IT FOR YEARS TO COME.
5,Better than the book for laughs!,"Still remains one of my all time favorites! Loy and Grant are in their prime and couldn't be funnier. The script carves all the humor out of the original book and then pumps it up a notch. The clever background sound effects add alot too! It may be incredibly dated, but some stuff never goes out of style, like great writing, acting and a good story to tell. The more recent remake ""The Money Pit"" doesn't even come close to the original. This is entertainment at its best, folks, don't miss this one."
4,Silly bit of fun on a rainy day,"Great movie for a rainy afternoon. Slightly annoying if you take it seriously, but otherwise a cosy little romp around 'what not to do' when building your own home. Sarah Benny would be rolling her eyes at this. Best line: 'bicker, bicker, bicker'. Worth viewing."
3,OK at best,"This is a good electric toothbrush and great for travel as the 2 AA batteries last months. However, we've been through three of them in two years. Expect them to last about a year. As with other Braun toothbrushes, the brush tips are expensive and can be hard to find. Our local grocery chain discontinued all Braun/OralB toothbrushes and tips.The customer service people at both Walgreens and Eckerd tell me they just can't get their orders filled. This went on for the better part of 2003 and we finally picked some up during a trip to Europe.I switched from a rechargeable Braun as I got tired of the rechargeable batteries losing their ability to hold a charge after a couple of years. Even if the AA battery models only last a year they are a much cheaper both initially and over the long run. They do vibrate a bit more but clean just as well and I find the shape much easier to handle than the rechargeable models."
3,get the Vitality . . .,"Braun's competitively priced electric powered toothbrushes are very good values and reliable performers. Most models use the same rotating type replacement toothbrush heads.The Advance Power 4500PX Bright D4510, like most electric toothbrushes that use AA batteries, delivers significantly lower brushing torque than a toothbrush with a built-in rechargeable battery, such as Braun's Vitality model. The Vitality may cost a little more, but it delivers a lot more brushing power, and the high capacity battery allows for many uses between recharges.Both Braun models will do a good job, however the faster more powerful Vitality, will probably get more done in the same amount of time. Given the small price differential, and long life rechargeable battery, the Vitality would seem to be a much better value. Those who prefer a more gentle brushing action, can go with the 4500PX, or any of the multitude of AA battery powered toothbrushes available."
4,Travel Brush,"This is battery operated and if your at work or on the road. This is perfect as a tool to clean the teeth well as the action will work better the conventional brushes. The rotating head offers a more effect cleaning. It is fun too. Power of the head is much lees than the units with the charger base, however is good for a quick whitening."
2,Too Little Fields in Dull Melodrama,"W.C. Fields belatedly appears in the final two reels of this creaky 1934 melodrama, which disappointed many fans when it was first shown on television. As ""mail-order husband"" C. Ellsworth Stubbins, the Great Man shines in his small role - displaying immediate chemistry with the one-and-only ZaSu Pitts. Too bad ""Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch"" was their sole film together. Fields completists will discover a few priceless moments after hitting the fast-forward button."
3,Fun old story but VHS really bad quality,"This is a fun old story from a book written around 1903. It shows what life was like, how poor people existed, and what some rich people did because they decided they wanted to help. I enjoyed the story, but the quality of this VHS was horrible. I recommend the DVD instead if you want to get it."
2,maudlin,"You have to love Fields to go through this, and he is pretty good in a film of pretty horrible material. heart-tugging piffle is what it is, although the lady who plays the man-desperate spinster is pretty good and she nets Fields through a catalog. Pauline Lord, well known on stage, sinks the ship time and again, but actually has a curious affecting -- and affected -- way about her. Fields, according to his recent bio, didn't think much of this and he knew his material. If you've seen everything and you're down to this, by all means, kill a few hours, but, really, if you haven't been to the classics, do not tread here at all."
3,"Great for reference, poor for instruction","This is a great reference material for someone who already has some exposure to Cantonese. The lessons are not structured well and I wouldn't recommend this as a sole study guide. If you've already completed a course like Pimsleur's Cantonese I or the Teach Yourself Cantonese course by Hugh Baker, this will help you fill in some of the blanks in your vocabulary. There are e-dictionaries included that make excellent reference materials. You have the English word, the kanji (simplified or traditional) and the romanized Cantonese spelling. One of these also has a sound clip for each word.You won't really learn much grammar here, but it's a good place to beef up your vocabulary. Especially if you have a native speaker to practice with you."
5,great product,very nice for l lb. think I probably need two pounds - but came fast and nice product would highly recommend
3,Difficult to put on,"Despite the velcro strap, these are difficult to put on because of the shallow opening at the front of the shoe. Maybe it would fit a very skinny foot."
1,Star Wars LightSaber Sheets.,"nothing special, very cheap sheets. not very soft. no battling light sabers on the sheets as advertised. not worth it. i feel like i got sucker punched."
3,Poor quality but the kids love them,The thread count of these sheets is very low and as a result they feel fairly rough but my teenage boys don't seem to mind at all and the pattern made these a perfect addition to their Star Wars themed bedroom.
2,like sand paper,"Too much polyester! My 4 year old doesn't seem to mind, but they are thin, stiff and abrasive. The graphics are patheteic."
2,Disappointing,"I knew that these were kids sheets, so I wasn't expecting the quality to be great, but I was disappointed by the design of the sheets. The picture makes you think that they say Jedi all over them, but they don't. They have these wierd shield-looking things all over them. I bought them for a friend who is a star wars nut, and we ended up returning them and buying a vintage pair on e-bay."
1,La Crosse Wireless Rain Gauge,"Doesn't work, don't waste your time or money. I should have listened to the reviews. An empty tuna can works just as well"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,"I THOUGHT I WOULD LIKE A NICE ACCURATE DIGITAL WIRELESS RAIN GAUGE.WELL I WAS VERY WRONG!! THIS PRODUCT IS VERY INACCURATE,& I CONTACTED THE COMPANY TWICE ON THIS PRODUCT.FIRST I GOT AN E-MAIL ON SOME TROUBLESHOOTING IDEAS TO SOLVE MY PROBLEM,TRIED THEM ALL,NOTHING WORKED...SO I CALLED AND TALKED TO A TECHNICIAN...STILL DOES'NT WORK...WON'T EVEN REGISTER...ON MY READOUT!!! ALL I WANT IS MY MONEY BACK...WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT (MONEY BACK GUARANTEE?) THEY WANT ME TO SEND IT BACK (PAY SHIPPING COSTS) AND HAVE THEIR PEOPLE LOOK AT IT TO SEE IF ANY,DEFECTS ARE IN THIS UNIT....OR SEND ME A NEW ONE...WOW....YOU FIGURE IT OUT!!!! I'LL STAY WITH MY OLD-FASHIONED PLASTIC HANGING RAIN GAUGE...MORE ACCURATE....ALL I GET IS EXCUSES!! OR I'M NOT INSTALLING IT RIGHT!!! BUYER BEWARE!!!!"
2,"Great, when it works.","I bought this item as a gift. It worked great, and was very accurate. But it only worked for about one month. The receiver stopped working. My dad really liked it, so I guess I'll have to buy another one that is more expensive. They get better reviews so maybe they'll work longer."
1,Cannot Get it to Stay Working,"I really like the size of the rain collector versus other ones on the market as well as the indoor display. However, I cannot keep the thing working. I contacted the company via email and received a quick response. After trying their suggestions, I would get it to work for a while, but it would usually have lines on the display by the next time it rained. I have the rain collector about 25 feet from the window where I have the display. It just doesn't stay working. I have given up and have started looking for a new brand."
1,"Glitchy, doesn't last","This item started off badly by not syncing with the gauge when first purchased. There were no instructions in the user guide on what to do. I emailed the company and after a long delay they advised me to fully drain the display after removing the batteries and then replace the batteries to sync. This worked after a couple tries. However, when the batteries in the gauge died, the same thing happened after replacing the batteries...display would not sync, even following the previous directions. Also the gauge did not weather well, with the plastic becoming hard and brittle. One of the side catches broke off when removing the cover and one of the latches on the battery cover snapped off when removed. So, this ones going in the trash after less than a year."
1,Look for another product,"The good news about this product: when it worked, it correlated pretty well with what my human-read rain gauge recorded.The bad news: it only worked for two weeks, it is painful to take the cover off the base unit to install and replace the batteries, and it is difficult to reset. If you are willing to go to the trouble to reset it, or to try to get the two units to connect to each other again, you have to push one of the buttons twenty times (no kidding - those were the instructions off the internet!) after the batteries have been left out of both units for more than 10 minutes. Surely programming can be done better than that!"
1,Very Disappointed,"I have been using Amazon for along time, and everything that I have bought has been wonderful until I purchased this item. I guess I should have listened to other reviews for this product. I would NOT recommend this product to anybody. It worked one time, and then it did NOT work anymore. I sent the warranty to the company and it was returned to me with no address available for this company, I called the number in the booklet nobody would answer the phone and never called you back either after leaving a message. This thing has the Weather Channel Logo on the product and if I was the Weather Channel I would NOT even put my logo on this piece of Crap. People Please do NOT buy this product you will lose the amount you spent Plus the Taxes and its not worth the trouble. If I was Amazon I would NOT sell the item either.. Very disappointed, this was a Christmas present for my Dad. Never again will I buy from this company (La Crosse Technology)."
2,Great while it lasted,Worked really well for seven months. Unit failed to be able to communicate with the sensor. Changed batteries in sensor the the base unit as instruction said. But still does not work. I gave it 2 stars because while it did work it was just what I wanted.
1,"Poor design, does not function.","I was never able to get this rain gauge to work. The receiver would not talk to the transmitter.The battery holder design for the transmitter is poor, the lid that holds them on is flimsy and unable to maintain electrical contact across the battery terminals. Don't bother."
2,Weak,Signal from unit has a hard time makeing 50 feet. Tried 2nd set of batteries hoping that was problem but no luck. And this is 50 feet line of site. When I put the receiver on other side of sliding door even the glass (still line of site) caused the signal to drop. Is great when it works. Tried a second unit same results. Stay away from this.
3,La Cross Wireless Rain Center,"An Amazon Verified PurchaseGentlemen:I followed the manual exactly for setup and the unit worked one time and have not been able to get it to work again. Have tried replacing all batteries but still does not work.Please advise return/replace procedures.Respectfully,Bill Simmons"
1,weather channel rain gauge 9005TWC-IT-CBP,"Piece of junk. Sometimes in Phoenix it goes several months between rains. By the time it was obvious it did not work, it was out of the warranty/exchange period.It has a teeter totter device with a magnet or piece of steel that passes by a sensor. It did not register until I filed the pivot to move it closer to the sensor.To reset the device takes a marathon removing and installing batteries until it is finally happy.After all that, compared to a wedge style, ""it rains and fills up the gauge"", the device reads 1/3 to 1/2 less than the actual rain fall.Its present reading is .23 inches, that rain fall was actually .48 inchesMy other weather instruments are Oregon Scientific, it is my fault not sticking with them for a rain gauge.rll phx az"
2,rain gauge,"The rain gauge that I received did not work at all. I returned it and had no problem doing that. I will probably get another one at a later date. I have had the same product before and it worked, so this particular one must be a 'lemon'."
1,Don't waste your money on this one,"I bought this unit to replace an Oregon Scientific unit which I really liked, but it finally died after about 5 years and is no longer available. From the start this unit was trouble. It would not transmit anywhere near the published distance. When I would get it to work, it would work for awhile, then lose reception. I finally located it about 20 ft from the receiver. Accuracy is very poor. It is lucky to measure half the rainfall compared to a manual rainfall gauge. Also, you frequently have to clean spiders out of it. It finally quit working after 8 months. (Yes the batteries are fresh and the spiders are cleaned out.) I get 0.00 but it will not measure. I have considered sending it in under the warranty, but since I don't like it anyway, why waste the postage? I think it is going to end up in the recycling bin with other electronic trash."
1,Twc rain guage,Do not waste your money. Very cheaply made. I have been putting batteries in this thing now for two years. Now it does not work at all. Junk
1,"Completely Worthless, Dont Buy","I bought this product and had a real problem getting it set up. The receiver screen would only display dashes for the first 11 times I installed, uninstalled and reinstalled the batteries. It worked one time and has never worked since (2 months). I tried calling the 800 number listed in the instructions 5 times and once I let it ring 60 tomes and no one ever answered. Don't buy it!"
1,Junk.,This did not work out of the wrapper.I received this as a door prize and got what I paid for nothing.
1,Doesn't work,"First one stopped working after 3 months. Thought I would try a new one (yes, it was silly). It didn't work from day one. I have decided to go with the manual method of putting a visual guage on the wall and walking out to look at it. Quality is not there."
1,Not accurate,"I have two other rain gauges, both the old tube type, sitting right next to this model La Crosse and it has never indicated the same reading as the other two old types that always read the same. My neighbor has this model too and he has the same problem, no accuracy. Don't waste your money, stick to the old tube types as there is a reason they are still around, they work."
1,LaCrosse can't make it work,"I bought the weather station first. Everything worked fine except the rain gauge. I sent it back and they sent me a new one. That didn't work either. I like the rest of the system, so I just bought a new rain gauge. Still doesn't work, even when the rain gauge is right next to the receiver. Garbage."
1,Bad Product,I recieved this rain sensor for Christmas. I tried for 2 weeks to set it. Sent several emails to the company for help and did not get a response. They do not have an 800 number. I sent the product back to Amazon. I had to give it one star rating since there is nothing less.
1,what a piece of junk !!,"My Oregon Scientific rain guage that I had for several years died. I read reviews on another website praisingLa Crosse producs. I ordered this one from Home Depot last week and received it yesterday. After numerous attemptsto follow the limited instructions in the manual and more of the same from their customer ""support"" agent I am returning it to La crosse and have entered a claim with Paypal for a full refund from Home Depot. I will order the Oregon Scientific unit from Amaxon. A lesson learned. I wish I had seen the reviews here first."
1,Precisely inaccurate,"This device is inaccurate by exactly 50%. I have checked it several times against a conventional rain guage, and I have to double its readings to get accurate information. I do not like that, and hope to find out how to correct it. Meanwhile, I cannot recommend this rain guage."
1,Inaccurate by Half,"I installed the guage according to directions, level and away from any obstructions, and it regularly reports rainfall up to 50% less than the tube gauge that sits beside it. And the innaccuracy is not even consistent, so I can't apply a correction. I would not buy this gauge again and don't recommend it."
1,Trouble getting it to work.,"I have had trouble getting the rain gauge to work. I've installed new batteries,and finally, by pushing down on the battery pack, got the remote to work. However,as soon as I installed it outside, it quit working again. I have called the companyand left a message, but no one has returned my call. I typed an email message to thecompany asking for help, but no one has answered that email yet."
5,Numb3rs - Season II,"Excellent, extremely happy with purchase, but expected to be as Mr FBI is such a hottie!!!!!!"
4,good service,"Received in a timely manner. Haven't watched yet, but most of my stuff from Amazon has been great or quickly replaced. Thanks."
4,Numb3rs Season 2 Review,I am a huge Numb3rs fan so I am a bit biased. Since this could be Numb3rs last season I would recommend you get it if you are a Numb3rs fan like me. I heard rumors of syndication but have not seen anything as of yet. It's certainly not a waste of money if you are into the show like I am.
5,Season 1 was good. Season 2 is even better,Numb3rs is quite a different show that will keep you hooked. Interesting plots and believable actors. Their personal lives are interesting as well. Charlie tries find a way to get to Amita and Don is the eternal bachelor. I'll buy season 3 as soon as I finish number 2. This is good entertaining!!!!!
4,Only one flaw,"The show is great and there are no technical flaws in the disk, but there is no subtitle option for hearing impaired."
5,"The writing gets better, the video improves","And still we maintain the family of characters, including the addition of Megan Reeves (Diane Farr), the behaviorist at the FBI. Megan is a real treasure. Time allows the writers to share more and more of the characters backgrounds. Where they've come from. Why they do what they do. The writing continues to gain believability and the directors continue to improve the view. You feel like you're right there. You laugh, celebrate, and cry along with them. They become an extension of your family. Cheer for the good guys. Bad guys can go to hell! :)"
1,So upset with dvd's,"I love the show, & was thrilled to receive season 2 as a b'day present, there's no close-captioning...& if that's not enough, let's throw in that discs 4 thru 6 are showing BLACK & WHITE(there's nothing wrong with my tv)!!!!!!!!!!!! WTH????? I don't even live in the USA ,this purchase was made while a relative was on vacation, so there's absolutely no recourse for me.....BUMMER! Quality control at it's best!"
3,Numb3rs season 2,"Hi There,After viewing six episodes,1. The plots are are less believable in this series as far as the application of maths are concerned.2. It's a pity that there is no subtitling. There is much more background noise these days in this sort of serie. I suppose that it seems more realistic but when you get a bit older and your hearing gets a little worse you just need clear talk. By the way, the new female FBI agent doesn't speak at all clearly. Seems to be mumbling all the time.All in all a bit disappointing and I have doubts about buying a 3rd series."
1,Did not last 1 year...,"Battery now lasts maybe an hour off the charger, buttons stick making it difficult to dial out (not to mention frustrating), and there are ""clicks"" for no reason when I'm talking so the other person on the line continually asks, ""Is that your other line?"" AGH! Avoid at all costs! My boyfriend loves his Panasonic phones, so I'm going with the best-rated Consumer Reports Panasonic. It's awful to get a bad phone- just move on! (And my dad is an engineer and picky about electronics- so I know all the ""tricks"" to take care of phones and extend battery life...)"
5,Panasonic NI-C78SR Steam/Dry Iron w/Stainless Steel Soleplate,"I do really like this iron and would purchase again. However, you need to know there are some specific rules to follow when turning this iron on and off or preparing it for steam (preheat for 2 minutes). In my opinion, the iron is on the heavy side, so those with hand, wrist, arm or shoulder problems may want to think twice about this one. But if you are looking for a heavy duty iron for clothing, uniforms, etc., then I think this one is perfect!"
4,Almost the perfect iron,"I like nearly everything about this iron but think it could have been designed a little better so there would not be a button which annoyingly hits my right index finger as I iron. The button is just where I rest my hand so I have to relearn how to hold an iron after 45+ years of ironing. I like the way the iron works and like the retractable cord. The on/off dial is a little difficult to reach and also the filling is a little bit harder than some irons, but not a big deal. All in all, I am pleased with the iron but wish the ergonomics had been better worked out."
4,Good Steam Iron for home,Its a good Steam Iron and so far we didnt have any problems with it. the retractable code keep getting stuck once in a while but once if you push it out and try again it works.
4,Good iron for the price...,"After using this iron for the last year I can give a pretty good review. At first, I loved this iron for the first 3-4 months. It was smooth over fabric and did a great job. Then, it started building a residue that caused it to stick to fabrics. Not sure if this was my fault due to ironing some type of fabric that had a treatment on the fabric or not but was able to scrub it off eventually. I don't think it is as smooth over fabric anymore and it tends to leak a small amount of water at times onto whatever I'm ironing. I think for the price it is a great iron."
2,"Good iron, but not quite happy for why I selected it","The retractible cord take some effort to use. There's so little room in the housing that you have to carefully feed it in or it will get stuck. In comparison, I have a rice cooker where you pull the cord, and it gets pulled back in without any further effort. The whole reason I bought this iron was that I don't like messing around with a cord in the morning when I want to get to work. Now instead of wrapping the cord in a ball, I have to mess with the retraction mechanism, and that takes longer."
1,DOES NOT WORK............,"I purchased this iron after the glowing reviews. I do not iron, I do not need to iron. I bought this iron after my daughter complained that the iron I had was lousy. I bought the iron, used it once, maybe twice. I thought, great, I have a good iron for when my daughter visits. That was over a year ago. It hasn't been used since. Yesterday, I needed to iron my Thanksgiving tablecloth. I dug out the ""good iron"" and plugged it in. It did not get hot, then the light that lets you know the iron is on, would not stay lit. Essentially, the iron turns off right after it is turned on. Maybe a short somewhere? Too much time has passed so I can not return it. BUMMER! The iron is brand new back in its brand new box, of no use to me."
4,good iron,"This iron works very well. I do notice that it doesn't get as hot as my old one but maybe they have some regulation about that. The old one was almost 20 years old. I have not tried the steam yet but am considering doing that to help get the wrinkles out since it doesn't get real hot.One thing I would mention to the manufacturer is that the retract button for the cord is located right where the palm of your hand hits when pushing the iron around. Viola! Cord all gone! I'll get used to it but they really should reconsider the placement of that button. Other than that, it irons...what more can you ask for???"
2,OK,"It works! Not very good quality. Cord does not retract very well, have to work at it! Takes out wrinkles what I guess it is supposed to do."
4,Pressing need,"My wife's old iron gave up the ghost, so I set about finding an exact replacement. What I found was that the old model's brand (I won't mention it, but it should be obvious) had fallen way out of favor. It was the review count on this one that sold it --- and so far, the reviews have been bang-on --- I do my own ironing, my wife has enough to worry about. Only one very small complaint: the water tank is a little small. But since it's so clear, it's easy to see when it's nearly empty. We keep one of those drinking bottles with the flip-out (not pop-out) spout nearby, filled with filtered water. (Hmmm ... if they'd included one of those bottles, maybe 5 stars!)"
3,Adequate,"I don't do a lot of ironing, so I am certainly not an expert on irons. I did like the removable water reservoir. The temperature dial is directly under the handle, making it awkward to maneuver."
2,Poor workmanship,"I really liked this iron at first, but after 30 days of use, the steam boost button stopped working, and that is the main reason for buying the iron.It is a good iron if you don't plan on using the boost steam button."
3,Panasonic Iron,"I like this iron, as the steam is variable and it gets really hot. The problem I have had is the automatic cord retractor, broke after a few uses."
3,It's okay with steam,It is working well. It's good to have the water compartment separate from base. Only cons is it doesn't heat up quickly. With steam it does make the job easier.
5,pANASONIC ni-C78SRtem/Dry Iron with Stainless-Steel Soleplate; The best electric clothes Iron I ever had!,That Iron is the best one I ever had. I use it many time and I am very satisfied. Water tank easy to fill. Temperator rising quickly. Ironing easily...
4,"Very nice, heavier iron","I bought this iron 2 weeks ago, hoping I wouldn't have to dampen my cotton T-shirts first. Works like a charm, although I am not used to the slight drag of the sole plate vs. non-stick sole plates. The maximum fill line is a bit hard to see; use 1/2 cup water and it will fill the iron perfectly. The spray feature is a bit irritating, as you have to aim at least 10"" back of the wrinkle you want to treat. The separate water tank feature is a waste; who wants to stop in the middle of ironing, wait for the iron to cool and then fill the tank? Just as easy to use a measuring cup, although the iron should be unplugged. Time will tell if it is the good quality it appears to be."
4,Works well,"The iron works great. It heats up quickly and holds its heat. I like the vertical steamer feature. It isn't as good as a real vertical steamer, but definitely works better than nothing. The only minor complaint is that the cord reel means that it doesn't fit in the iron holder on my ironing board, but that's a minor thing."
2,Panasonic = fail,"I purchase this Iron 9 months ago. As of today the iron shorted out. We thought it might have been the socket, but it was plugged into a surge protector, which is still working. We hardly use this iron in the last 9 months. My older iron still works, but had some rust on it. That is why we got this iron. We loved the retractable card and how you could take out the tank to fill up the water on this model. It made life easier. This was a good iron until it failed today. I was going to send it back to panasonic to get it repaired, but it would cost me more to ship it back unstead of buying a new iron. Good luck with this iron."
3,Great product value if you are not a heavy user,"I do a great deal of ironing as my husband and I both need dress shirts and a suit for work. I'm also one of those 'nut-jobs' that likes to iron my sheets and undies so I use my iron alot. This is a great iron if you have a shirt that needs to be ironed for that occasional funeral or wedding but if you iron as much as I do, you want an iron with a larger, smoother soleplate that has more steam holes.PRO'S:light weight, price, retractable cord works great and I like being able to see how much water I have in the steam tank.CON'S: Short cord, needs more steam holes and a smoother gliding soleplate"
5,Panasonic Irons rule,"My family bought a Panasonic iron in the early 90 and it lasted us about seven years. My parents bought another brand because they could not find a Panasonic in the store and the cord retract broke within two weeks. When I got my own place I bought this one and love it. Sturdy, does not leak, and is weighted well. No complaints after two years."
3,"Panasonic Steam Iron/Dry Iron, NI-C78SR","I purchased this Panasonic Steam Iron because my $80 Rowenta bit the dust in only two years. I will never buy another one even though it was my favorite iron. The Panasonic is okay but could use more steam holes. This model has a retractable cord and when ironing my hand occasionally hits the button and retracts part of the cord. Otherwise, it does a good job of ironing and I like an iron with a little weight to it which this one has. So far it hasn't leaked any water all over my clothes."
3,Panasonic NI-C78SR Steam/Dry Iron with Stainless-Steel Soleplate,"This is a lighter iron compared with my previous Rowenta and it is smooth to maneuver. However when the water reservoir is half way down, it stops releasing vapor, and you have to add more water to continue. Another negative aspect in this specific iron is that the top that you have to lift so that water can be added brakes easily. My iron is only a couple of month old and its top is already broken. I am not very happy with this iron."
5,I LOVE THIS IRON!!!!,I LOVE TO IRON AND HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THE PERFECT ONE. I HAVE TRIED SO MANY AND READ SO MANY REVIEWS. I FINALLY SETTLED ON THIS ONE. I MADE A GREAT CHOICE. IT IS WONDERFUL. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT MAY BE A LITTLE HEAVY BUT AFTER USING IT A FEW TIMES IT JUST GLIDES ALONG.....NOW IT'S TIME TO GET TO WORK..WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!
5,Love it!,"I have used this iron (or its predecessors) for the last 10 years. It shuts off on its own, has great steam, and has a retractable cord. By far, the best feature is the detachable water tank!"
4,good iron,I purchased this iron to replace one that I had for years and broke by dropping. This iron was affordable but not cheap. I love the fact that it has a removeable water storage and a retractable cord. The only issue that i have withthtis iron is that the cord is much shorter than I am used to and I wish it was longer. The stainless steel plat is great and i do not have to worry about hard water calcification on the iron or spitting on my clother. Great product
4,Good iron for the money,"For the money, this iron works fine. When ironing with steam, it will leak a little bit of water every once in a great while. But other than that, it's been a rock solid iron."
2,"Works, but I hate it","This was rated so well on all the ""best"" lists, I bought it. I was impressed by the steaming and how well that function rated. I hate it. It's plastic in a cheap way. It doesn't feel heavy or solid or sturdy. It irons just OK, but it's not impressive. I had a Rowenta that got scratched and I should have repurchased the same thing. That was a nice, solid iron that was just impressive. This did not live up to those expectations."
1,Worse iron that I ever owned,This is the worse iron I have ever owned. The writing on the dial wore off the first week I used it. It does a terrible job!!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK,Please do not buy this junk. The undercoating peels off after a couple of months and when trying to call Panasonic they don't pickup the phone and the automated machine transfers you to a blank line and disconnects. Tried this a dozen times and every time call hangs up without anyone answering. The nearest service center for this product is in Texas but i am in CA.
3,"Good iron, but...","This iron is overall pretty good, in particular:- It generates a lot of steam and heat- The retractable cord works well- Materials are of good quality and seem durableSome of the cons:- The steam sometimes spits out burning water, or burning water leaks. I got burnt a couple of times. It doesn't look like the iron is defective, however. That's just the way the steam comes out.- The temperature nob does not indicate for which type of fabric (nylon, cotton, etc...) it is supposed to be used with. Would be nice to not damage your clothes.Overall, despite the burns on my legs and the burnt clothes because I used the wrong temperature, it's alright for the price."
3,Good.,It's a good iron. The only problem that I have with it is the water reservoir could be bigger. I have to add more water after ironing four jeans. But it produces good quality ironing.
2,JUST DIDN'T WORK RIGHT,"When my old iron started malfunctioning, I ordered this Panasonic iron, based upon the description/reviews. It arrived in a timely manner and I was excited ... until I tried it. I used this iron on cotton blouses, using the ""Steam"" function, with the ""Cotton"" setting. Honestly, they didn't look much better than when they came out of the dryer! It was not ""Operator Failure"" because I learned how to iron over 50 years ago! The Retractable Cord was about the ONLY thing I liked! The pulsing steam disturbed me, in that I thought it wasn't working correctly. It goes back and I will NOT get a replacement."
2,Completely stopped heating up after 11 months,I've only had Black and Decker irons in the past so I decided to give this one a try. I've had this iron for 2 months now. It's light but gives a good amount of steam which helps get out the toughest wrinkles. I love the detachable water tank option. It makes filling the tank at the sink easy. The only negative so far is the latch on top of the tank. It's pretty flimsy and has already broken off. Other than that this iron works really well.-Update 6/26/2012Ok everything was going well until today. The iron won't heat up. What a disappointment after only having it for 11 months. Good thing I am still under warranty. I will be shipping it back to Panasonic for repair or replacement.
5,What I was looking,This iron works just as I expected. Is my first iron and I have just used it one time but I would recommend it.
4,Good Iron,"This iron does a good job. I like the look of it and it is very helpful that the cord retracts into the iron base. The steel plat is smooth and looks like it will clean well. I wish that the iron got a little hotter. I really expected a bit more from this product after reading so many other glowing reviews. It has good steam, and presses out most wrinkles but isn't the amazing ""steam machine"" I had hoped for."
5,Panasonic NI-C78SR Steam/Dry Iron with Stainless-Steel Soleplate,Nice product. Value for money. Functionally much better than the other higher or lower priced brands.
3,Okay iron,"I purchased this iron based on the many great reviews. For me, this iron is okay. I like that the water tank removes for filling, and that it has a retractable cord. It does take longer than my old iron to heat up. My last one was ready to go as soon as you turned it on; you have to wait until the indicator light goes off before this one is ready. This iron does produce a generous amount of steam. Although, I have not tried using it for vertical steaming yet. This iron is also kind of noisy with all the steam it produces. I have never noticed irons being noisy until this one. It's not really bothersome, just something that is noticeable. All in all, it's an okay iron. It does its job of getting wrinkles out well. I wouldn't purchase it again though."
3,Inconvenient Truth,"I only pressed two shirts with this iron. The heat and steam features worked fine, the iron removed wrinkles and creases fine. However, I was disappointed in the detachable water tank feature. First, the release button is located on the right side near the front of the handle. It sticks out, and I could not find a grip on the handle that did not result in the button pressing into my right forefinger. Second, the manual says the iron will work with most tap water... but not tap water that is hard or softened. My tap water is softened. That means I need to pour distilled or filtered water into the iron from a bottle, not hold the detachable tank under a faucet, as I had planned. That lessened the usefulness of the detachable tank.Bottom line, I packed the iron back into the box and returned it to Amazon. I immediately ordered a Panasonic model without the detachable tank."
2,Iron died after two years of average use,"I'm looking for a new iron because this Panasonic died on me after two years of use. It shorted and won't turn on anymore. The time, energy and postage needed for repairs are not worth it. I iron about 3-4 dress shirts and a couple of slacks every week. I use starch on my shirts and try to use distilled water whenever I can. The max temp is good enough for cotton shirts but not on linen shirts and sheets. The steam power does not match the professional steaming irons I've used as a child--my mom was a seamstress. You'll need a separate steamer for suits and other formal wear. The hotplate is pretty good at not staining compared to other inexpensive irons I've used. The removeable water storage unit is convenient. So there are some good things about this iron but overall an iron should not keel over after two years. Panasonic may mean quality in electronics and other things but not in irons. I found out the hard way."
4,Nice Iron,"I have had this iron for almost 2 months and like it a lot. It's easy to fill, heats up quickly and steams nicely. I have only one minor criticism. The tip of the iron is somewhat blunt as opposed to my previous iron which had a pointier tip. I do a fair amount of quilting and it's a bit more difficult to press seams but not impossible. I would definitely purchase it again in spite of this."
4,it works,Was looking for an iron for a while. just pick this one because the review was great. didn't disappoint. i like it that it has some weight to it. the seam function and the spray function work well. it is a good buy.
4,Getting better the more I use it...,"You know, when we first starting using this iron, it didn't get very hot. But i feel like its getting hotter as we use. I like the removable reservoir, but its hard to keep remembering to empty it and make sure the knob is on the dry position. Otherwise, it works really well."
3,Good working iron,"This is a fine iron for ordinary tasks. I've dropped it off the ironing board and though it came apart I could easily put it back together and get on with the job. The iron could be improved, however, wih a teflon plate...as it is it accumulates water residue and when I start out and puch the steam button it will spray brown water....it also leaves a sticky residue on the plate. SETM"
3,Too good to be true,"I have been using a Rowenta iron for years and it finally bit the dust. I didn't want to spend as much as a new Rowenta (one made in Germany) would cost. After reading the mostly positive reviews about the Panasonic, I decided to give it a try. It isn't a bad iron but it is just average and doesn't compare to what I had. I thought I had found a real bargain but I guess I should have remembered that if it seems too good to be true, it probably isn't true. I would not buy it again!"
2,not worth it at all bad choice,"took a chance as this was highly reviewed, however this iron leaks water at all temps. thought maybe it was first cycle but i have used a few times and the iron always spits water out no matter what setting leaving my clothes full of wet spots. the cord reel works good however the iron seems a little cheap when you hold it and i feel like the detachable water tank feels cheap as well and will break at some point. this will be my last time getting a panasonic iron and will stick to a trusted brand like rowenta in the future. buyer beware."
1,Not so Stainless,"I purchased this iron about 8 months ago. For the most part, the iron worked fine for those first 8 months. A few days ago, while using it on my khakis, it left a rust stain on the pant leg. I then examined the underside of the iron to see that it had become rusted. Judging from the reviews that have included comments about Panasonic's costumer service, I just need to purchase a new iron. I can't take the chance that the iron is going to ruin another article of clothing, and I cannot wait around in wrinkled clothing for Panasonic to back their product."
1,Sorry I bought it.,"This iron spits out half the water I put in the water tank, resulting in wet spots on my fabric, which I then have to take extra time to iron out."
4,Great iron and Works long to get your money's worth,"I agree with another reviewer - Beady Eyed. Mine model of this iron lasted for at least 6 years and I have to say that for the price I think it worked great. I think a couple of issues of mistreatment on my part lead to the demise - falling off the ironing board which I believe is what caused it to start leaking. The detachable tank is great and the retractable cord is awesome for storing it neatly. Worth the price as it is not terribly expensive, does the job and worked plenty well for me to get money's worth out of it - especially as it is $30 right now on Amazon. I don't think you can go wrong with this one if you are the person who irons a few times a week (clothes). The only con is that if you are someone who works with fabrics and heavy tablecloth or curtains extensively I would recommend a much more robust professional iron that can reduce the time for that type of big repetitive chore. But for most people it will serve all your needs."
4,Nice Iron,This is a nice iron. It is a bit heavy at the base because of the retractable cord reel. The steam and spray work well and it is easy to fill because of the detachable tank. And all the clothes I have ironed so far have come out great and it did not take any extra effort to get the job done. Overall I like this iron and would recommend buying it when you need an iron.
5,Love it!!,"I am one of those old fashioned ladies that still irons clothing. I also do alot of sewing and need a reliable iron .I have used and loved my Tfal Avantis 90 for several years but it broke when it fell off the ironing board and I was not able to find another one anywhere. This Panasonic is really wonderful, lots fo steam, light weight, I love the removeable water tank and cord reel and it has a long cord. It is a pleasure to use. The price is reasonable and it arrived quickly. I give it 5 stars!!"
4,WORKS AS WELL AS HIGHER PRICED IRONS,"THIS IRON WORKS AS WELL AS IRONS PRICED MUCH HIGHER. WISH THE WATER TANK WAS A BIT LARGER, BUT THERE IS PLENTY OF STEAM AND PLENTY OF HEAT. VERY GOOD BUY."
4,Very Good!,I am pleased with the purchase. It's a great iron for ironing man shirts! It looked a bit cheap when I saw it first time but in the end the quality surprised me nicely. I do recommend it.
2,Panasonic Steam Iron,"I don't iron much but you have to have one in the house because after six months you have more clothes in the ironing section of your closet than you have to wear. I have always been a marathon ironer and I just got around to using it yesterday. I tried to open the attached top to put the distilled water in and it popped off and flew across the room, fortunately I found it before the cat. The cord is far too short and it doesn't want to return to its home by 8"".I also think I could have done better sprinkling the clothes than just using the steam. Disappointed in PanasonicIt will do since it is here and I will only use it a few times a year, but I would not purchase this iron again."
4,A fine iron but small water capacity,"I've had this iron for well over a year and have found it to be a fine performer. Heats fast, lots of steam, not too heavy. The removable water chamber is not just a gimmick but helps in refilling the iron. One drawback is the very small capacity of the water tank. Looking a the design of the iron, there appears to be plenty of room to have made the tank larger.This iron also has a retractable cord which is a very handy feature.All-in-all, you won't go wrong with this iron unless you do A LOT or ironing...then you'll find yourself making lots of trips to the sink for a refill."
3,Stainless Streel base leaves dress pants shiny,"I am happy with this product, except for the one thing mentioned in the title.I have only used non-stick irons in the past. If you keep a good watch on the temperature the stainless steel bottom works just as well. However I noticed that my wool and synthetic (acrylic + polyester) formal dress pants tend to get shiny over the seams and pockets. It might be necessary to use an ironing cloth between your fabric and the iron. This is an inconvenience.I should note that this issue has not happened with other fabrics or shirts."
3,Nice features but Weak at Removing Wrinkles,"The Black & Decker D2030 was my last iron and figured this would be a nice replacement especially considering all the glowing reviews. The features are nice, retractable cord, removable (though small) water tank and the high steam production. However I believe the iron is lacking in the most important area of all- removing wrinkles. I tried ironing simple 100% cotton dress shirts and the iron failed to remove many wrinkles even as I fiddled around with steam and heat settings. My prior Black & Decker iron was significantly better at removing wrinkles and if I hadn't throw away the packaging for the Panasonic I would return it."
1,dead after 2 months :(,"The title says it all. It completely died after two months of regular use (every weekend). I loved the feature where the water compartment snapped on and off, but clearly something is lacking in the engineering of the heating element. They probably went with the cheapest heating element possible to save 5 cents off the overall cost. >:("
2,Sadly dissapointed.,"After reading the reviews I thought I would take a chance on this iron. My son has a panasonic iron that I use at his house and I love it, so that was another reason I was willing to take a chance. I was replacing a Rowenta that was spitting and dripping all over my clothing. This one said ""no drips"" and I believed them. It worked fine for about a week and the drips started. Wrapped that puppy up and sent it back!"
5,Luv It...,"Detachable water tank and retractable cord/wire... what else is there to say?I like portability and this Iron gives me that.Oh, it works well too."
3,panasonic iron,"i ended up returning the iron, it automatically shuts off when it gets up to a certain temp and then you have to wait again till it warms up."
5,Panasonic Iron,"Since ordering this iron, I have used it twice, and I really like it and would reccomend it. It's hot, produces a lot of steam and does a fine job. I am still getting accustom to the removeable water reservoir. However, it is not neccesary to remove for use."
3,A bit disappointed,"After reading the great reviews for this iron, I took a chance and ordered it sight unseen. On a positive note, I love the fact that I can detach the water reservoir to refill it, and the retractable cord is nice. I've been using it for about three weeks now and have found several aspects that are less than ideal. First, the iron is unstable. Twice I caught it pitching forward off of my ironing board, just catching it on it's way to the floor by the cord. Second the spray button produces a jet of water, not a spray. So I've gone out and purchased a spray water bottle, and I also found a heat resistant iron shaped mat at Bed, Bath and Beyond that I place on my ironing board. Now I always put the iron down horizontally so that it won't tip over again. Next time I'll buy another Rowenta."
1,very poor drippy iron,"I received this iron in a timely manner and immediately tested it on some clothes needing to be ironed. This iron heated up poorly, never getting very hot, and was incredibly drippy. Maybe this was a defective one, I don't know. I don't want another one of these to try. It was a really bad iron. Previously, I had a Rowenta for at least 10 years that had broken and decided to try this Panasonic. I returned the Panasonic immediately due to its poor performance and have recently purchased another Rowenta, with which I'm very happy."
4,"Good product, water leakage may need improvement","We like the product. It is fast and gives tremendous vapor. The removable water tank is nice and easy to refill. Some reviewers complained the tank is too small. It is not a big issue. One tank is enough for 8-9 clothes. The retractable cord is really a good idea. You will never mess the cord up! The only problem, if it is, is the water leakage, esp. when you have just have a new water refill. In general, it is a good iron."
4,like this iron alot,This iron is great. It isn't too heavy or too light. It heats quickly and is quick to adjust the heat when you change the dial. The steam is excellent.I recommend this iron.
4,MANNY,"Good iron. Produces just the right amount of steam and you can get an extra blast as needed at the push of a button. Retractable cord as some reviewers reported does not pull in the cord all the way, although it was received with it all the way in. It leaves about a foot of cord hanging out."
4,Panasonic iron,This iron is reasonably priced and easy to use. I like the detachable water tank which makes filling easy. It produces a large amount of steam and glides smoothly over garments. It does take a little extra time to clean the iron as directed after each use. The retractable cord does not always work; sometimes it only retracts part of the way.
1,Not happy with the one I received,"I bought one Panasonic NI-C78SR from Amazon.com. When it arrived, the seal (tape) of the plastic bag was broken and the water tank had water in it. I returned it to Amazon and received another one with the same condition - a broken-seal bag and water in the tank. I guess the iron comes with water."
2,Uncomfortable Grip,"Handle design on this iron is very poor and uncomfortable.If you are right-handed, the release button for the reservoir is positioned right where your index finger wraps around the handle. This causes the button to poke uncomfortably into your hand the entire time you hold the iron. If you scoot your hand back on the handle, the heel of your hand will be resting on the cord retracting button.I am male with average size hands and the grip on this iron is too small and poorly designed for even short, occasional use."
3,too heavy,"This iron is way too heavy. I do not want to feel like I'm doing a weight training workout when I'm ironing. I didn't actually use the iron after getting it - once I felt how much it weighed I returned it. It probably works fine, but I want a lighter iron."
1,just died after only 3 years ownership,"I loved this iron while it worked, but just the other day it seemed to overheat during use. The iron got so hot it burned my ironing board cover and it was smoking a bit. I turned it off and when I plugged it back in it would not work. I feel that an iron should last long than a few years, dare I say 10-20 years. I will not buy this iron again due to short life."
2,"Me, I don't like........",Everything is OK except the retractable and flat(or H)-shape power code. But it prevents me from the joy of ironing.
1,"Hey Panasonic, why don't turn the d*** power off on your iron before you package it!","Safety first, right? Your instructions explicitly say to TURN THE POWER OFF BEFORE UNPLUGGING! So why don't you follow your own advice?Excuse me while I go put my hand in a bucket of cold water."
4,Good iron,I purchased this iron recently and the only complaint I would have is its weight. It irons very well and the steam feature saves a lot of starching. I would buy this again.
4,Great iron at a good price - Easy steaming!,"I had to replace a rather expensive old school iron recently and after looking around - I decided to take a chance on this; not too cheap, not too expensive - just right pricewise. I was delighted at all the niceties of this iron. First, the steam is ready quickly and I get nice bursts when I need it. Some people use a spray bottle - I use steam; and this delivers. The removable water reservoir is a treat; making it super easy to fill it up without dragging your iron into the sink. I took a star off because while the retractable power cable is a nice feature, it doesn't always work - and you're left with a dangling cord or you have to repeat the process several times to get the cable in proper. There is a piece of ""red tape"" that shows you that you've pulled the cord out too far - unfortunately, by the time you see it - you're pretty much out too far. But these small niggles aside, I have NO problem recommending this iron."
5,Love this iron!,"I love everything about this iron. I iron everything, and this iron works beautifully. I bought two, just in case they quit making this model. It's perfect!"
4,Panasonic Iron,I am very impressed with this iron. I love the retractable cord. I also like the detachable water tank. Just push the little button on the side and it comes out easy. so far I have had no problems with it.
4,Great iron,"I really love this iron. I really like the two different steam settings and the resivoir is easy to remove and fill. I also like the nice dial and multiple heat settings (which is probably typical for a steam iron). I did notice that sometimes I will get some residue on my close, probably from my hard water or build-up in the iron, which may be fixable with a cleaning. Also I could see how the retractable cord could break after time. Mine still seems to work okay, but every once and awhile it won't retract as fully as it use to. However, it fucntions great and I would easily take a broken cord retractor for a great iron (if it ever does break). But for now, it is perfect!"
3,great for 4 months,This iron was fantastic when it was working. I've had it for about 4 months and used it daily then it just decided to stop working. Sigh...
5,It's a Hit!,Our two year old has become obsessed with Blue. We received this DVD as a gift... and we ALL love it. He is happy to have another to add to his collection (and so are we!)
2,"Only 1 episode of Blue's Room, the rest are Blue's Clues with Joe","My mother bought this for my 3yr old after he split his lip wide open (ouch!). He'd been asking to see it but because of our schedules he didn't get to watch it very often. We were VERY disappointed to see that there were 4 episodes on the DVD and only 1 of them are Blue's Room! Misleading title, they should've labeled it Blue's Clues with a bonus ep of Blue's room. Very disappointing. The one episode of Blue's room was cute."
2,This is not blue's clues,"What a disappointment - my 3-yr-old loves Blue's Clues, and that's what I meant to order for him. This is Blue's Room, a completely different show with a big talking ""Blue"" puppet. My son cried when I turned it on and wanted to know where the real Blue's Clues went. The episode of ""Joe's Clues"" (which is similar to the normal Blue's Clues) is OK, but for us it's not worth the price of the DVD."
4,Read this book!,"If you are new to Christianity or are exploring spirituality I highly recommend this book to you. For Christians, Chris Seay has done a masterful job contextualizing the Gospel in a contemporary story, as he already did with his other books The Gospel According to Tony Soprano and the Tao of Enron. More Christians should take note of how Mr. Seay goes about this process of using culture as a vehicle of the Gospel. He certainly goes way beyond the Wachowski Brothers----I doubt they ever intended the Matrix trilogy to communicate the Gospel, but that's beside the point of what Seay is doing. He goes deep into the Matrix story to help us see the Gospel in a fresh new way."
5,Spiritual Side of the Matrix,"Chris Seay and Greg Garrett have done an excellent job of looking at the spirtual side of The Matrix and have taken us with them down the rabbit hole. This is a great book for anyone who thinks movie-going can be more than just a mind-numbing experience, but desire to interact with film as a reflection of the culture as a whole and, in this case, some of society's deepest spiritual needs.I say, get the book, read the book and then see the rent the movies again - quick, before the last installment comes!"
4,Interesting ideas,"This book is a fun, interesting look at themes in the Matrix films from a Christian point of view. The authors never claim to know the true meaning of the film triology but offer insightful and thought provoking reflections on the film in dialogue with Christianity.Far from dogmatic, this book should stimulate further discussion and reflection on the Matrix triology and it's relationship to issues of faith."
2,CHRISTIANITY COOPTS THE MATRIX,"This book really deserves two and a half stars. I give the authors credit for their more liberal slants on traditional christianity. That said, throughout its 2,000 year history christainity has played the role of mind control that the makers fo the Matrix movies are criticizing. A central theme of the Matrix Reloaded sequel is that the Machines are using the cult of Neo's messiahood as a mechanism of social control.However, this book misses that point and joins the current trend in christianity to coopt popular aspects of pop culture (as opposed to creating anything original itself) and misuse them to gain converts. (Christianity, like Walmart, always needs new customers.) For that ""original sin"", I docked the book a couple of stars. The authors seemed interesting and bright, why spend their time trying not to stand on the shoulders of the Wachowski brothers when the Wachowski brothers make movies that undermine the dogma of christianity?"
4,Great- Historical read,This series is really great. Historical writings for all to study and ponder what those who have gone before have to say and their example for our lives. Would like to purchase more in this fine series of books
1,Fairly offensive to anyone not sharing her fanatical Christian views,"This book should have a warning on the cover which states ""Most material in this book will offend non-Christians."" The author used what could have been a wonderful resource for homeschooling families as a soapbox for her own fanatical religious views.Because many families do homescool for religious reasons, I have come to expect a religious slant to most books on the subject. Most authors, however, are able to present the material so that their writing is able to relay useful information without infuriating the reader. If I wrote a secular homeschooling guide and ripped apart Christianity the way this author does to non-Christian thinking, I would probably have trouble getting it published and receive bags of Christian hate-mail if it were published.This one is going out with the recycling as I wouldn't want to subject anyone else. I received no valuable information from this book."
1,Very disappointed,"I found this book very disappointing. For one thing, the author suggests a creepy method of spanking children, including a chart on the wall of the ""discipline"" to be administered with a wooden spoon for various offenses. But hey, that's not punishment, maintains the author. If I can't keep my children's interest in the material without hitting them with a spoon, then there is a major problem with the instruction. I'm not going to resell or give this book away. I'm going to throw it out so it doesn't fall into the hands of someone who actually follows her advice."
3,Helpful,Follow the author's instructions. It s very helpful for times that you fall off the organizational wagon. Recommend more for very open minded unschooling parents.
1,Disappointed,"No where on my order did this specify that I was ordering a used book. I am not happy with this at all. It isn't even a gently used book. The inside is not written in (as far as I can tell) except for a name, but it was clearly not taken care of."
2,Disapointed with the company,"I was very disapointed when I recieved the shoes with the ink tag still on them. From what I understand it happens a lot with this company. Then to learn I would have to return the shoes, wait for them to crdit my account, and re purchase them. Instead of the company just removing the ink tag."
5,It was very good,I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS JUST ME BUT THAT MOVIE WAS REALLY GOOD BECAUSE I AM FROM THE HOOD AND I WATCH MOVIES LIKE THIS ALL THE TIME I JUST THOUGHT THE WAY IT END WAS VERY GOOD
5,i wuz good 2 me,i thought the movie wuz good. it made sense and it wasnt all stupid like other movies. had a nice plot and everything. i recommend it if you like movies about drugs and killin.
3,An answer to questions,"In my studies of Sociology and Religion I was able to see the evolution of the African American church by first seeing the beginnings of the church during slavery in America. Frazier offers an excellent assesment of how the church grew and answers questions such as how the negro churches became agencies of social control and when the walls broke down and the church left its status as a refuge. But the best thing about this book is that you're given the freedom to read what Lincoln has to say about post-Frazier times and the black church. I, however, feel that Lincoln is very biased in his assesment and doesn't offer an objective view. This book is very useful to any other person interested in the sociology of religion."
5,It cleans like magic,"I bought this to clean under the screen of my psp because there was a lot of dust on it, and it worked excellent. i have tried other kinds of cleaning cloth, and they clean the the lcd screen leaving some kind of lines and particles on it, but this one cleans without leaving any lines or particles behind, and by the way, it comes factory sealed, and its 3 cleaning cloth you will get. The color of the cleaning cloth is black."
3,"Good, but book better","I had just read the book and decided to watch the movie since it was so highly lauded. The movie was good, but aspects of Bauby's life was changed, which I did not like. I understand that there was some tension in making the movie between the mother of his children and girlfriend, but I thought this just did not do justice for the faithful girlfriend. Watch the movie for entertainment, but read the book for his real story."
2,Melodrama undermines true story,"A very moving and expertly crafted film. Too bad it derives its melodrama from fictionalized characters and scenes. Why not stick to Bauby's story and pull out the real drama that was his life? Read the book, and understand the man's actual story. Also, read the Salon article online (Feb 23, 2008) which tells how Bauby's family was upset with the director's distorted facts added for cinematic effect. The real story is better."
4,A chilling reminder of our frailty,"Le Scaphandre et le papillon is based on the very novel it's about. The locked-down Jean Dominique Bauby is paralyzed everywhere except for one eye. Right away you get locked into Bauby's head with a unique lense that, without panning, drifts into and away from objects and faces(faces that were like giants on the big screen, small-ant-syndrome) and makes ghosts of everyones face when he bleeds tears. To Jean, the only thing alive to him is his vivid imagination, memory, and wakeness. You glimpse his artistic voyeurisms as open vaults. Deep under-water in a Diving Bell, alone, and sometimes with another. A metamorphosing Butterfly. Unlike Jean Dominique you can venture away from his tortured existance while keeping that reality going. You slip away into his past, in recollections, and then in flashbacks as seen fit by English speaking Director Julian Schnabel. An artistic movie that makes you think about your own mortality."
4,"Inspirational, but it seemed quite long","This movie was captivating at first, but was long. It wasn't literally any longer than a normal-length film, but it felt like it was never ending at times. A little humor here and a little sadness there, this movie was worth watching, but I'm not sure if it's worth a second watch. It is very inspirational, for the main character writes a book with only one eyelid, but depressing at the same time. A well-done movie that is definitely worth the time to watch."
3,Interesting story,"After seeing the movie, I am now curious to read the book...which definitely says something! Although I have indeed heard it done before, communicating solely via the batting of a singular eyelid is amazing!"
3,Diving Bell,"Very sad story and hard to watch since my husband whom was a fighter pilot suffered a stroke and had global aphasia and some of the same challenges. Enlightening for those who are unfamiliar with ""shut in syndrome""."
2,The Diving Bell & The Butterfly,Unfortunately this disc was sent to me with Canadian code requirements which means I can not view it on my big screen or indeed view it more than twice (I live in New Zealand). As this information is not recorded on the exterior of the package I cannotreturn it for replacement as I have opened the parcel. Rather pissed off as I have in effect thrown my money away
2,The Butterfly,"If the script had only led the viewer to the religious significance of the human delemma of isolation that we all experience in life , it could have been a life affirming message. Instead there is an overtone in the entire movie that this guy is incredibly rich and he has the best care in the world.In case any viewers might think there is a meaningfuil signicance to the invisability of the common man; forget it. The movie goes out of it's way to illustrate the man's distaste for Christ or religion.I can't believe that a man so badly disabled would so easily disregard God; so I wonder about the producers.It adds up to perfectly artistic dispair, a French tradition in a land at war with itself."
5,A reminder of life unlived...,"I love this movie! It was well casted and directed. I loved the way the director made the movie from the patient's perspective. My father also suffered a massive stroke. He is paralyzed on one side of his body. He sits on a wheelchair all day. His body may not have the movement, but his mind is more clear than any of us. When he tells a joke, he knows exactly what he is saying...only the words come out muffled and we don't understand what he is saying. We laugh because he expects us to. All his life, he hates to depend on people...and now, his very basic needs have to depend on people around him...especially my mother, his main caretaker. This movie did a wonderful job of portraying the frustration of the stroke victim. I walked away with more appreciation for simple things in life. Thank you, Jean-Dominique Bauby, for writing the book and thank you, Julian Schnabel, for making it come alive. I'll share this movie with my parents."
5,very accurate discription of a stroke,I had a very bad stroke three years ago. I even had surgery. I loved this move. The only differance betweem me amd him was modern medicine. It brought back many memories. Very accurate. Very inspirational. I still go to therapy and I still have a limited range of motion. I can now touch my ear with the effected hand/arm. It made me realize how much I can do.
3,"Interesting, but not that entertaining","I think I needed more understanding of who he was, what his life was like, before the stroke, and locked in syndrome, to really engage with the film and not just watch it. I normally love intelligent films with engaging narrative but this was so much like 'navel-gazing' by the director, I felt locked out."
1,"Poor Quality, Feedback, Snap Crackle Pop","Hey - I purchased this for my 71 year old Mom, and it's just terrible. I do not know which importer now has the AT&T; license to make phones after the Southwestern Bell purchase of it's former Mother - i.e. Ma Bell AT&T; but this thing rates below the cheapie Conairs of the past. I am sure she did not keep the packing material or the reciept, so we are going to eat this one and move on to something better. If this is a VTECH phone (used to have the rights to the AT&T; brand) then shame on you guys.Can you tell I used to be in this industry? Get your act together guys, get the QC manager down to the plant in China."
2,Good at First then gets worse and worse,"I have gone through 2 now. at first it works fine and it's not very big, but then it will get real hot and then stop working either that or it will take forever to open a page."
1,Keep your $$$,"This article is just a book review. If you are wanting to learn the nitty gritty of IA, keep looking."
5,Mike's ability to paint an image,"I have been reading novels like this for years, usually by very well know and seasoned authors. Mike has done a great job with visualization for the reader and creating a suspense that makes you want to keep reading. The back stories of the characters makes you almost feel like you know them from your life or a previous book in a series.I think these characters have the legs to develop into another book."
5,Fun Read,"As soon as you start reading this book, you will want to finish it. Isn't that what a fun read should be? It is filled with colorful details and great characters. Enough to pull you in...not so long that you will have time to get bored. You immediately experience the characters...and feel with them. Just when you think you know the plan...he fooled you: again.This is truly a fun and enjoyable work. I'm hoping to see some of these characters in his next novel."
2,It was ok...,"It didn't have a main goal, but it was always fun picking out lego dudes and building and flying a helicopter around lego island. But it was still quite hard in some cases."
3,Lego Island: One cent was the correct price.,"This game doesn't have a very straight-forward objective. It lacks in storyline and it occasionally crashes the system. However, the graphics outshine other lego games, such as Rock Raiders, Lego Racers and Creator with stunning brilliance. The characters are colorful and lively, but their short speeches are repetitive and annoying. You can't skip the speeches or quit the game during that time period, just sit and smile while any one of the 32 characters flaps their yap. Even though you can play as five different characters, there is almost no difference except how people greet you and the actions you use. You need a lot of stuff to get the brickster out of jail (I'm not going to tell you what) so don't worry your head about him wrecking the island. Just mosey through the races and the activities, then let the game collect dust on the back shelf and turn your mind to other matters, like the next two games in the series."
2,If Only ...,"If only the film considered religion seriouslyand developed characters beyond the superficialthis could have been a great horror film.There are very good effects and cinematography.There is action and humor and decent acting.The look and feel of the film were very goodand the plot was interesting.But when the Devil has at least as much respectfor the Holy Bible and the morals and theologyof the Christian religion as the exorcistand his friends, you have a problem.Camp is good and this film couldhave been very good camp.I wanted to like this movie more.The movie ended with our heroletting his sister drive the car.What a guy!"
2,Daisy the Cat,"I thought the cat, who ends up licking blood from a severed head, was a phenomenal extra. Her name is Daisy and she is completely underrated. I hope we see more of her in the future."
1,Calling Inspector Clouseau,"When I saw the cover photo, I immediately thought of the Pink Panther movie, in which, several times throughout the movie, Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers) would put his hand on a globe in exactly the same way as Lou is doing, and lean on it slightly, so the globe would spin and he'd fall on the floor. How appropriate, given the poor understanding of economics on display in this book."
3,What to do?,Outrage over shifting of American jobs to Mexico (and others). Effective solutions are thin for number of chapters on subject. Roll back NAFTA? Re- write NAFTA?
3,Not a perfect world,"Dobbs is right, outsourcing will have negative consequences for the US. I read in many of these reviews that outsourcing is good because it encourages people to ""upgrade"" their skills. Come on people, you can't keep going to school or training seminars forever. On the other hand and off topic, just as communism failed, so capitalism too will fail. That's just due to the fact nobody can predict the economic future. Just comes to show, this is definitely not a perfect world."
4,Honest Polemic,A market loving Republican has written a powerful indictment of the outsourcing of jobs that is hurting the middle class. As a business journalist & news anchor he fully understands the machinations of the business world. Ex: Free trade is not always fair trade. Note our trade deficit has been growing for thirty years. Some reforms & tasks can't be left to the market alone. The Federal & state governments have a duty to the citizenry. The latter with the peoples consent can stop corporate greed & corruption by preventing the constant outsourcing of middle class jobs to third world countries. If nothing is done to stop the jobs from leaving. We could become in the not to distant future a two tier society. Pharoahs at the top & a poorly paid majority of drones at the bottom.
1,China fixation,"America has ""twin deficits"" - current account deficit and foreign trade deficit. Lou Dobbs has little to say about the former, even though it is just as damaging. As for trade, China is responsible for only 10% of all US trade with the rest of the world. Our trade deficit with China is a little higher, but even this doesn't justify Lou Dobbs's obsession with that country. I'd almost call him China-possessed.Clearly, his fixation with China has more than economic reasons. Who knows what those could be?"
1,THE SKY IS FALLING! THE SKY IS FALLING!,"Chicken Lou's is pompous, dull and self-important. His book proves he's a wolfish businessman in journalist's clothing. I am ashamed that I paid for this book."
1,Outsourcing. What about Insourcing?,"Lou Dobbs (a/k/a Mr. Smoot Hawley) loves to talk about the outsourcing of American jobs. He even has a list on his web site of the thousands of American companies that ""outsource"" jobs. He loves to report when GM or Ford has layoffs.Of course he never mentions the thousands of foreign companies that invest in the US and create millions of jobs for Amercians. Or that Kia has recently stated that they will build a billion dollar factory in Alabama.HEY LOU, WE HAVE ALREADY TRIED YOUR PROTECTIONIST BALONEY IN THE 1930'S. IT LEAD TO THE GREAT DEPRESSION, HITLER AND WWII. GIVE IT A REST!!!"
1,Hogwash,"Dobbs is promoting, and capitalizing on, the idea that Americans are about to start dying in the streets from hunger. He obviously wants to get on the book band-wagon that is a thriving money-maker right now. The concept of this book reminds me of Paul Ehrlich's ""The Population Bomb"" published in the late '60s. Erlich claimed we were in a ""race to oblivion"" and pretty much suggested we would all be dead by about the year 1990. Guess what? Erlich became a millionaire with that pile of garbage. Dobbs is trying to do the same thing with his ""economic hysterics."" I ain't buying Dobbs for a minute."
1,Lou Dobbs is either a bigot or a fool.....,"It's amazing that this big mouth still has a show on CNN, he sounds like either a pig or a biggot. If he wants to blame all of America's problems on a certain group of people, he better start with the immoral Media that reports lies as facts, stuff that he and CNN do all the time."
1,OUTRAGEOUSLY MISINFORMED!!,"This is the worst book one could possibly read if one is interested in learning about how economics works in the real world. None of the advice in this book would be useful to anyone living in the real world. Instead, Mr. Dobbs' analysis of the economy is flat out wrong. No country would be wise in adopting his analysis or conclusions. Instead, we should ignore the Dobbs' of the world and instead focus on making our country competitive. Certainly our idiotic 35% corporate income tax rate is not making us any more competitive!"
1,Lou Snoozed Through Economics 101,"Dobbs makes the valid point that some workers are hurt by outsourcing. Then he claims this increases the trade deficit, which he asserts is a bad thing without ever explaining why. Dobbs's view of trade was shown to be incorrect 200 years ago by Adam Smith and David Ricardo, two of the most important economists to ever live. The book also lacks an index and footnotes or endnotes, and I get the impression that it is mostly a rehash of points made on Dobbs's TV program. To *really* find out about trade and related matters at the beginning of the 21st century, read Tom Friedman's The World is Flat."
4,Horses Don't Fly,"Absolutely wonderful read. A must for military vets, especially pilots. Shows what courage mixed with ability can do for young men."
5,From Cowboy to Fighter Pilot,Great Story. One more people should read. Very well written with many humorous and interesting anecdotes . Feels authentic without being pretentious or braggadocios. Interesting to note the differences between the British and the Americans on so many different levels. It was enough to make me wish I was born in time to fly in WWI. With the Brits. Better than many fiction novels out there.
4,Above average memior that combines the old west with WWI,"which is the first time I have seen this combination and it works effectively as Libby uses all of the qualities he acquires breaking horses and surviving brutal winters in the mountains of Colorado to stay alive in the skies over Europe. The comparisions he makes between the various armies, especially the hospitals is also unique and important. Some may long for a more emotional account but that wasn't who he was. Fred Libby didn't complain, whine or run from a fight"
5,"Horses Don't Fly, a one of a kind story.","This is a story of Fredrick Libby, a great American. This is one of those books that can not be put down until it is done. Waldo Pepper's tale seems tame when compared to Frederick Libby's true story. The money spent on this book was well spent, this book is a keeper."
2,Non Fiction,"The Six Million Dollar Man guy takes a crack at a coffee table book, this time about astronomy and Mars. The possibilities of organic compounds being found on the red planet were making news at the time, so I suppose this was part of that. Not a whole lot of substance here, but it is attractive enough for a quick flip through."
5,UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE,WURTS HAS WRITTEN A FANTASY MASTERPIECE. YOU ARE ENTERING A WORLD OF HIGH ADVENTURE AND MAGICAL MENACE.SHE GIVES US A MEMORABLE HERO IS ALMOST DRIVEN TO SAVE OTHERS AND REWARDS AT ALMOST THE EXPENSE OF HIS LIFE. THE STORY IS SEEN THROUGH THE EYES OF HIS BEST FRIEND AND YOU SEE THE TORMENT OUR HERO GOES THROUGH
2,A dissappointment...,"Having read the many critiques of this book, I was surprised and disappointed when I found this to be another churned out fantasy novel. Quest after quest to obtain some ridiculous goal, only to find yet other goals for additional quests. At times I thought the author was creating situations to add pages. While one could argue that the protagonist is unlike others of this genre, I found the hero to be moody, obsessed and contrived, and as unlikable as he is improbable. In addition, the leaps of logic required to follow this story are too much to keep this tale interesting. In the end, I found myself reading to finish the book, rather than out of enjoyment."
5,Still a classic,"I discovered this book while I was still in high school, and must say that after all these years it is still one of the best pure fantasy stories I've read. The story is interesting and original as well as a typical example of the author's writing style. I still read it regularly after 15 years, and to me that is one of the tests of a good book. That you can still enjoy it over time and after growing up. Highly rcommended for all who love classic fantasy."
3,Bring this along for your next massage session,"Decent background music for relaxing. a couple of the tracks go way too long. If you are a fan of Eno's Ambient works, this is for you."
4,F&F build a mesmerizing &#65533;temple&#65533; of sound,"As Robert Fripp and his colleague Jeffrey Fayman make their debut on the Projekt label, they join an artist roster that includes such spacey synthesists as Steve Roach and Vidna Obmana. The four-part Temple In The Clouds CD actually fits in fairly well with the works of Roach and Obmana. It consists of four variations on swirling, droning synthesized atmospherics with a few nature sounds thrown in (mainly ocean waves). The closest reference is Fripp's Soundscape series, where he used his ""Frippertronics"" style of guitar playing to create abstract tones and electronic ""sound installations."" (see also Fripp's collaborations with Brian Eno) The four pieces on Temple are lovely, majestic, drifting ambient themes. If you're a fan of King Crimson electric guitar, you might be a bit put off by this CD. If you like the Soundcapes, though, you ought to give it a try."
1,Came with a hole,"I got a pair of this a while ago, and I didn't open it until now, only to find it has an enormous hole in it. Now is too late to return it or to leave seller a feedback, so I guess the only thing I can do is advice people to open the package as soon as you receive it, so you can take action if something is wrong with the product. Very dissapointing."
4,Great Book,"When i first bought this book, i was thinking ""ok this is going to be such a disappointment"" But as I read on, i began to learn more about christina. Stuff that i never knew before (and i saw the christina mtv specials too!) The pictures in this book is great, and she even reviewed each song on her album. What i didn't like about the book is the fact it doesn't have more of her personal commentary. It is bascially a fact type book. But the pictures in that book is great! All in color and it even teaches you how to send mail to christina!"
1,Disappointing,"I bought this tape and was disappointed. At 30 minutes, it covers only the barest of details about Austen's life and brings no insights to bear on the subject.It's just photo after photo mixed with terrible video shots of current day Austen sites like Bath.Very dreary and not a bit worthy of Jane Austen. Low budget and low interest."
3,Nothing really new but a good read,"I have other books that are similar to this one. So, nothing really new."
5,The New Literary Standard,"I really had thought reading novels was a valid use of my time. I have been an avid reader for 20 years and I assume I have spent a good part of my life reading. However, the moment I picked up Florio's book, I knew that the past 20 years of my life had been a total waste. Not only haven't I put it down since, but I've had the text printed on the walls of my house and tattooed onto my body, so no matter what, I can have this literary masterpiece with me. I threw out all of my other books, movies, games, even my TV, radio, wife, and children. A definite must-read."
5,Changed my life,I just wanted to say that I went into the camera store the other day and was astounded when two women started making eyes at me and started flirting with me. Amazing. It was so funny how they were acting...Then all the women at work have started being VERY nice to me--ALL SINCE I STARTED CARRYING AROUND FLORIO'S BOOK!This tome is paramount to the greatest thing ever written. Adventure. Time-travel. Football.This book is not an aphrodisiac but it has increased the quality of my love-life twentyfold. From the moment you open its sleek cover its words will dance off the page and into your heart. Five Stars.
1,far-fetched and poorly written,"To NFL fans who regularly surf the net for great football news, the name Mike Florio is synonomous with ""Fred Edelstein"" and ""Len Pasquarelli"". Florio is the James Callendar of the NFL - a rumormonger without scruples. No ""scoop"" is unfit for Florio to print - even if it's completely untrue.Florio's book is much the same, unfortunately. Quarterback of the Future is very much a hodgepodge of lame and tired cliches about race mixed in with a pinch of science fiction. It doesn't work.It's very difficult to pull of a quality sports novel. Many great writers have tried and failed. Florio is not a great writer, and he too fails. Miserably."
4,A clear and insightful book.,This book is an excellent introduction to the development of the sociological tradition and is also recommended reading for anyone interested in nineteenth-century intellectual history. Nisbet's book would be an excellent complement to H. Stuart Hughes' CONCIOUSNESS AND SOCIETY and Raymond Williams' CULTURE AND SOCIETY: 1780-1950. Nisbet's book clarifies key concepts of nineteenth-century social thought without assuming (as Hughes does) that the reader is already fully versed in the works of the thinkers he examines.
1,A Text Book?,"This is no text book; maybe for a doctoral program but never for bachelors level reading. It is very hard for the reader to follow main points. The author uses intervening ideas within sentences that causes the reader to lose the purpose of the original thought and the author does this throughout the book. I simply stopped reading his side notes within sentences and would jump to his main point where he left off. Even doing this the reader would still need to have a thesaurus and a source to do historical research on the ""thinkers"" of sociology, as the author calls them because he only provides his views on what those historical figures thought and wrote. For a good sociology theory text book, read/study, ""Social Theory Re-Wired: New Connections to Classical and Contemporary Perspectives (Contemporary Sociological Perspectives)"", it is far superior and more interesting."
1,Save your money,"I have no idea if this movie itself is any good or not because we couldn't stand to listen to all the background static sound and alot of the time faces weren't recognizable, so we turned it off after a try of 20 minutes. This recording of this movie should be ""recalled"" and customers given thier money back. Lisa C"
4,tough read but helpful,I used this in a class about one drug addict and how a social scientist followed the course of his life.
5,Must Buy!,"Offbeat, silly, low budget parody of Ed Wood's cheesy brand of sci-fi.I bought it because I'm a huge fan of Lola Lane. Her scene with Blake Palmer is the hottest, in my not so humble opinion. She also has a rousing lesbian interlude with Kelly Steele.Kat Kleavage also does an admirable job.If you grew up on schlocky scifi & goofy horror flicks, you'll enjoy the juvenile humor. Also if you have a thing for big boobied milfs, this movie will be right up your alley!"
2,Works fine just doesn't fit the 240z,This product worked fine but he fittings you need on either end are not included. I even tried going to several hardware stores to fashion my own pieces which are rivited onto the original at either end. It won't fit on the car without these. I ended up finding one on Craigslist for about $7 and I suggest you check your classifieds and junkyards to find this part.
5,Mario Lanza,"Great cd, I especially laughed at the Donkey sernanade. It brings back wonderful memories. Everything was delivered as promised."
5,A Great cross-section of Mario Lanza's work,"This is the best collection of Lanza's recordings that I have yet found, many of which I have on the original 45rpm releases. My only objections are personal, and not a fault of this collection - I would have liked to have had ""Lolita"", from the reverse side of ""Granada"" on the original 45rpm, included. Also, I despise ""I'll Walk with God"", which was included in the original movie in a blatant act of pandering to the religiosity of the film audience. It doesn't belong in this otherwise great Lanza collection."
4,Contains most of his major songs,Although it contains most of Lanza's well-known songs there are a couple I would have left out as they have not aged well. Most of them have stood the test of time.
3,Warning!,Pros: This is a very cute mosaic .. a great addition to your garden.Cons: the shipping and handling cost more than the item. S&H; was $20.64.A bit much in my opinion.
2,Ours broke immediately,"It was easy enough to make, with clear instructions, but you may want to let it sit for more than 24 hours, we took ours out after one day, put it in our garden and it broke in half as soon as someone stepped on it."
1,GLASS in a STEPPING STONE??? REALLY!!???,"Who puts glass in a craft project for kids and makes it a stepping stone????? Ended up with cut feet, a dangerous glass mess to clean up. This item needs to have the glass pieces removed from it ASAP!!!"
4,Fun though a bit tricky,"I ordered three of these to make gifts/keep one, and put my children's handprints in the middle instead of the mushroom. The kit comes complete with all you need, and the instructions are clear for the most part. Mixing can be tiring (my husband mixed all three of ours), and both the dry and wet cement tends to get EVERYwhere. The project is a MULTIPLE step process. With careful/thorough planning ahead, each of our garden stones turned out great, but we had definitely improved by the third time. Most importantly, don't add too much water. A tablespoon at a time, as suggested; it's worth the patience."
3,One little glitch....,"My daughter had a great time with this product! Creating the marble pictures and creating the stone was fun for her. Only problem is that if you use photos, which she did, the water from the cement mix rises to the top and seeps into the marble photos, destroying them. So the finished product was rather disappointing. They key would be to wait until the excess water on the surface has dried, THEN place the photo marbles into the stone. Oh well, better luck next time..."
5,gift,"cheap fabric, but looks great on my sons window. I was happy with how great it looks with my sons bedding. overall, I would buy it again. I have no complaints with the shipping or the purchasing of this product."
5,Shih-pooh loves it!,"My little Shih-pooh is 11lbs and fits ion this with plenty of room to spare! She had begun chewing on the tag, but once we removed that, she has been very content."
5,Great bed!!,This bed fits perfectly in the Midwest 1524 iCrate Single-Door Pet Crate 24-By-18 -By-19-Inch crate. It is very pretty and seems to be very durable. Our puppy loves it!! Would definitely buy this bed again.
4,"Midwest Quiet Time Fashion Pet Bed, Pink, 22 x 13",Was looking for a slightly smaller size cat bed/carrier lining. The color is as pictured. Very happy with product as well as my cat.
1,bed,"well, this was the teeniest tiniest bed I have ever seen..I measured the crate and this was supposed to fit..got it home and a LOT less to it than what is advertised."
5,quiet time,Nice & soft. Helps our Yorkie enjoy her kennel while she rests. She feels safer with a shelter even though we don't close the door cause she knows we won't accidentally step on her. Fits perfect in our medium size pink kennel. It doesn't ball up like other materials. Can wash or shake out if needed.
2,Cheap Pet Bed!,This pet bed is no more than if you had a blanket or quilt for the dog to lay. Cheaply made product would not recommend!!!
3,Decent price but product flattens!,"I have a little five pound Yorkie and she LOVES the product-- soft and cushy, however after a week, the bed has already flattened and I can tell it's not as comfortable as it was before. But what can you say, it's only $15! Looks very cute inside a hot pink crate and my Chloe loves it either way!"
4,nice bed,"This is a nice soft bed. My only complaint is that it is smaller than the sizing on the chart. If you order and want it to fill your crate, order one size bigger. My puppy likes to lay her head on the side bolster. I ordered the tangerine color and it is really pretty."
4,Good Bed - Not Much Padding,This bed is a lot thinner than I thought it would be. It's decent for a crate as it is pretty easy to wash. Overall I would recommend if you have a dog that likes lying on the floor.
4,Perfect for what I wanted,"I bought this to use in a crate, and it is perfect! It isn't thick enough to be used on any cold surfaces, such as cement or anything, but for the plastic bottom of my crate inside the house it is just right. It's really soft and cute!"
2,*** MUCH SMALLER *** than advertised,"***************Advertised: 22"" x 13""Actual: 20"" x 12""***************One of the rare disappointing experience with Amazon, for sure. Now I will have to go out and buy another cusion that meets our expectation."
3,Midwest Quiet Time Fashion Dog Bed,"Purchased the blue one. It is very soft and pretty. Only gave it three stars because its very, very thin; more a mat than a bed. Not what I expected, but my dog likes it so I didn't send it back."
4,Great Color!,"I would give it a 5, but it doesn't have a sticky bottom, so it slides on the floor and carpet, but it's a great color and it's only for the crate so it serves it's purpose."
3,"Great price, but so-so quality","I have a faux sheepskin bed similar to this that has lasted for years, got a new puppy so I thought I would get a new bed. Unfortunately the quality of this one leaves something to be desired. I bought this because of it being machine washable. The first time I washed it some of the stitching on the flat part of the bed started to unravel and it continues with each successive washing. Just ordered another kind to see if that one serves us better. The puppy looks very cute lying in the pink but I am not sure this one will last very long."
4,Kennel pad.,"Product is well made, but is just a little unsized for the kennel that we purchased.Our kennel size is 22x13x16. I wish that it was offered with the kennel as an option so that it would have fit better. The length is the only thing I would like to see corrected."
2,Falls apart in washing machine,"Very soft, but thin on the bottom. The pillow around the outside is soft. My cat used it once, maybe twice. Maybe because he's a big male kitty with an attitude, and sitting on a powder blue puff bed is not his thing. Who knows. The stitching that holds the pillow came apart in the washing machine and created a huge mess. I threw the thing away. If you buy this, make sure you wash it by hand, which is probably what the directions stated if I would have read them."
3,B. J. loves it (My cat),"Well made, smaller than I expected. I should have ordered larger size it is a little small for large cats."
2,Flimsy,"Did not last long at all. Made of very thin fabric. Bed not stuffed at all,only stuffed around edges. I would definitely not recommend."
5,Crate bed - love it,Perfect size. Has held up well even after washing in the washing machine. Perfect for my 5 pound chihuahua. Very well made
2,Too small,Product did not fit the crate. Seems to be smaller than advertised. Will probably replace with a different crate bed... Otherwise the dog seems to like it but since it does not fit snugly she keeps flipping it over when looking for her treats...
5,SO SOFT!,I LOVE this beautiful pink doggie bed & so does my dog. SO fluffy and beautiful I am VERY happy with my purchase!
3,good for the price,i use this for my kitten in her crate and its very thin at the bottom. i wish there was a bit more padding. mainly bought it because it was pink!
3,Bed size,"This is a good product, I just should have ordered the bigger size. Did not expect it to be so little although my fourche terrier seems to be fine with it."
5,Great beds!,"I purchased several beds for my cats. They love these beds, and I love them because they wash up beautifully. They also fit nicely into my carriers, making the trip to the Vet a little more comfortable for them."
4,Nice bed for a cat,"My cats love a nice, soft surface to sleep on, so this is perfect for them. It's certainly big enough for the biggest cat to get in, and the two females usually sleep together anyway, so they can fit in it, too. The biggest one, the male, has been checking it out and kneading it a little, so he's getting it all ready for a snooze. I'm pleased with it."
3,A great book for young adults,"Barbara Wersba did a wonderful job telling the story of Albert Scully, who like so many adolescents yearns for adventure. The story takes a look at what Albert does in his life in search of this adventure and when he does he finds that his life has more meaning than what he had thought. A great book to read, especially if your in high school."
1,This is NOT a Hopalong Cassidy novel,"The protagonist's name in this novel is Tom Boyd and it takes place in the early 1840's. It has nothing to do with Mulford's Hopalong Cassidy so don't be expecting Hoppy to be there.I have rated this 1 star only because it is mislabeled. The story is 5 star, though, with the first 7 chapters giving an excellent description of steamboat travel up the Missouri River."
3,Cool but lacks power,"This was pretty easy to assemble and the instructions are great. I wish most kits had instructions like the one that came with this kit.I gave this product 3 stars because I was not able to create the Jacob's letter experiment. I used a 12.8 volt, 3 amp transformer that I got from Radio Shack in my construction. With this transformer, I wasn't impressed with the arc length. I was getting max 1 to 1.5 cm arcs. I doubt you could get 1 inch arcs with the 14 volt, 3 amp transformer that the instructions recommend but I didn't try it.You need about 30 kV for every inch and I don't think this kit can deliver.All in all, this kit is cool and well designed. It only lacks the power that I was expecting so I only give it 3 stars. I would have given it 4 stars if I didn't get bored of it after an hour playing with it.I have posted a video on YouTube for reference. [...]"
4,"Good movie, pretty cars and a real plot","Some really nice cars in this movie, and good chase scenes, too. I had never heard of this movie, but I saw some clips on TV and since I am a huge Fast & Furious fan I want to add this to my collection. I've only seen Dennis Hopper in Waterworld, he reminds me of Christopher Walken in ""The Rundown"".One more thing: Nadine Velazquez is yummy!"
2,Car movie,Cheesy car movie but bought for information on the GTO and speed channel episode about it as I am a proud owner of a 2004 GTO
1,Unbelievable rubbish pitched at 13 year olds,"A number of talented actors walk through this sham, half awake. Motor cars, and tiny minds, poorly scripted, rubbish for the brain dead. Get a life."
4,Great low profile jack for the price!,"This is a great jack for the price. I have a really lowered car and this does the job perfectly. Only needs 2.5 inches of clearance to get the job done. I gave away my ramps I used to get my old jack to fit under my car. The only issue I had with this jack is it's weight, over 100 lbs! I would recommend this jack to anyone who has a lowered car."
2,False Advertisement,"I'm disappointed in the advertised description on Amazon which reads:* Minimum height of 1-1/3-inches and maximum height of 20-inchesWhen I received it the minumum height is 2-1/2 inches which is false from the description (The 20-inch max height is true). My '56 chevy is low to the ground because it is a prostreet so my crossmember is only 3 inches from the ground. I have a slight cement slope that connects to my garage floor so I thought 1-1/3"" (in the saddle) would be a perfect fit for this jack to go under my crossmember. WRONG ANSWER! The end result for this jack to work is I needed to place a 5/8"" plywood in front of the tires and drive my front wheels on it. After that, the jack had enough clearance to get under my crossmember. If it wasn't for this clearance issue, I would rate this jack more than 5 stars. I think I can live with placing a plyboard everytime I need to lift the car because I'm tired of seeking a jack that has a low saddle of 2 inches or below."
5,Great jack for lowered cars,I have a lowered 3000gt/stealth and this can reach the front and rear jack points with ease. Much safer to jack the car up from these points than trying to use the pinch welds on the side.
1,OK Jack,Jack was missing parts and leaking oil. I had to return it because they didn't have the parts it was missing. But the jack seemed to be of good quality at a good price. Too bad it wasn't supported well.
4,Very nice,Hard to lift in tight quarters. Plunger must travel 60-75 degrees before lift occurs. Other than this it operates wonderfully.
2,LS-V4,"I tho bought that when I order the leadsinger LS-V4, It was going to be sivler. It is black just would like to know thatI did get the right one."
3,Not very sofisticated,"It is a dated and poorly written book, but it deserves three stars for its approach on the very arid niche regarding marketing which is veterinary.Instead, if you're a vet, go read some Philip Kotler regarding services marketing."
4,Crazy Lips Warning:,"So,I just wanted to give everyone a heads up on this movie since all i got was a review telling me that i should see it because its one of those WTF?! types of movies and... Yeah, its definatly one of those buts its also an oh! hell no! Type of film. Its an okay movie once you get past the rape, necophelia and almost insest but I just wanted everyone to be warned on that front since i didn't have that warning and i sat down to watch it with my friend, her younger brother and of course there mom came in half way through.You've been warned........"
1,"Oh, this is crap...","This movie is crap with a capital CRAP. All cult movie enthusiasm aside, it's truly bad. It's for people who think things like ""Faster Pussycat, Kill Kill!"" are great cinema. It's not as funny though. I laughed one whole time, when Ms. Lucy hocked up a super-loogy while rambling around in the woods with an assault rifle. Otherwise, my main purpose in watching the whole thing was an ongoing disbelief that it could get any worse. I was wrong, it just got worse & worse all the way to the end. If you've got time to waste on this instead of the hundreds of much better Asian horror flicks out there, go right ahead and let it take a dump on your eyeballs. Like I said, crap, crap, and more crap."
5,We need this for the ceremony....,"Twisted, twisted, twisted. Thats the best word I can describe this movie with. FIRST, its not a traditional horror, more like a multi-genre movie. It starts as most J-horrors do, slowly, but once it starts gaining momentum it doesnt let up till the end. More confusing than any other movie, I found myself with my jaw on the floor, saying ""No, they can't do that!"". Way, way over the top in its attempts to be cruel, I really enjoyed it. You had better be pretty tough to endure some of the stuff they throw at you. Some parts will sicken you to the core, and others will make you laugh. For fans of J-horror, you MUST see this, just to get a handle on these reviews. It is made by a fantastic group, but takes a far different path than most."
4,"A ""must"" read if you're getting a cochlear implant.","I loved this book. I am getting an implant on May 21, 2007, and this was required reading for me by my surgeon. I found myself nodding in agreement at so many of her thoughts and life experiences. The description of her mapping afterwards was encouraging and helpful. The task of learning all the environmental sounds was fasctinating to me. I am so inspired by Beverly's story! The only downside is that the technology has advanced so much in the 10 years since this book was written. She wrote of possible advances, that have been here now for a several years. But it still is a wonderful story."
5,An absolute award winner,"Chasing Venus is an award winning book!!! Peg Watts-Cartwright has written about a Native American/White young girl who has faced the trials and errors alot of us growing up in a mixed race home have. I was so amazed at how my life mirrored hers.Growing up in a mixed race home myself, I was compelled to feel each and every feeling Kasey had felt throughout her life. Yet, at the same time, growing such as Kasey Watson did, into a young woman with pride and hope. Knowing the light that shines within will always get you through.Her lessons from her elders were very heartfelt and true, though, you never know the rewards or lessons until time passes. That is another great gift Kasey had to offer herself as well as her friends and family.She grew to a beautiful young woman able to face it all with the one thing that means the most, pride.This is a beautiful story of a girl comming to terms with and accepting herself as she is, a precious gift!"
5,Great fitting Playtex bra,"This is the most comfortable bra in the 18 hr series for me. Being a fuller figure, this bra gave me support and it cooler than the other bras I own.It is my favorite style for her in Florida."
3,playtex 18 hr satin bra,"The good things about this bra are that the fabric is soft and comfy and the extra bit of padding over the underwire goes a long way to making it easier to wear for 18hrs. The straps are also pretty comfy.Not so good things about this bra are that I'm not happy about the way the cup separates from my body in the underarm region. Think this might be a sizing issue though, I've been measured as a 44D, but this size seems to be a little roomy in the cups."
1,cone bra,"This bra looks pretty but makes a total madonna cone look. It's comfy, just not great looking. I love playtex bras but not this one. Also, the toffee color is actually peach, go figure. Makes a nice sleeping bra!"
4,playtex bra,I am happy with the Amazon way to buying good products. The speed in getting the product and the way that I can find the items I am looking for is very easy. If I don't happen to find it at a store I can always look up the item I want here. Thanks Amazon
1,this book is incoherent and does not have enough depth.,The book How to be a Wine Expert is not even a good choice for the avid beginner. It has little information that the reader can utilize in becoming a wine drinker that will be able to distinguish an Ecco Domani from a Rothschild.
4,good deal,The book is in fairly good condition. few pen underlines at the end pages. this almost looks like a new one. The book store had also promised of 90 days warranty. everything is good and book is in good condition as stated in their review.My only complaint is it took a week longer than promised delivery date. but the book delivered was worth of waiting.thank you!
4,Panasonic makes nice cordless phone systems,I like this phone system just fine. I would buy it again. I only give it 4 stars because the digital answering maching sound quility is not as good as I wish it was. You just can't beat the sound quality of voicemail service from your phone company with a phone based voicemail system such as the one on this phone.
3,Nice cordless,"This is a very nice phone,sleek and easy to handle.Nice voice , caller id spelt .Only downside is it has only 50 numbers for memory.regardsAnandq"
2,cheapend,"Bought to replace a Panasonic kxtc911, this phone feels cheap. It's smaller, lighter and flimsier than the 3 year old unit it replaced. It is for my 91 year old mother, and she's had problems adjusting to it because the buttons are smaller and the button id's harder to read. There is an annoying delay in the speaker as the volume cranks up at two distinctly different levels...softer when first turned on and then normal. Otherwise, it performs ok. I'm not sure that mail order is always the best way to go...if it was from a big box store, it would have gone right back, but because it has to be wrapped and shipped back, she'll live with it. Besides, Mom's nowhere near as fussy as I am."
5,THE BEST PHONE EVER!,"We purchased this phone to solve the problem of interferance between our wireless network and our Uniden 2.4 Ghz cordless phone. This phone completely solved the problem, and delivers the clearest calls I've ever heard on a cordless phone. The talking caller id feature is great when you can't get to the phone right away. I would recommend this phone to anyone having problems with interferance between wireless devices and a cordless phone or if your tired of hearing lots of static from your cordless. The price from Amazon was EXCELLENT compared to other retail stores."
4,IT'S GOOD BUT NOT PERFECT,"I recently put this unit into use. It has many nice features which I really like; BUT, be advised:1. The message alert button on the base is very small and very dim. You have to look very carefully to seeif it is blinking. My previous answering machine had a much bigger, brighter light.2. The LCD screen on the base is small and could be easier to read.3. There is speed dialing ONLY from the base, NOT from the handsets. You must use the Phone Book ordial the number yourself from the handsets. My previous unit had speed dialing on the handset.4. The message player could be clearer. Sometime I have some difficulty understanding a message.The sound seems a bit muffled. My previous machine was clearer.CONCLUSION: Nothing in life is perfect."
4,No lighted keypad,"The phone is pretty good. The sound quality is no better or worse than a cheaper phone that I had prevously. My only gripe is that the keys do not light up, so if you are in a dark room you need to flip the light switch to dial."
4,Great product but!,It is a great product but some time the other caller complains that the voice is very faint. But works very good for most of the time.Features that I like in this products are:1. Calling the caller-id name2. Excellent Voice receiving3. Battery lifeFeature that I don't like is:1. Transmit Voice quality not always very good
4,Great phone,"The only flaw I don't like about it is the call log and caller ID. The handsets aren't linked so that when you review your call log on one handset it notes that on all the others. So one handset will show that you've missed several calls when you actually got them or reviewed the call log on another handset. Also, the caller ID isn't coordinated with the phone book. The call will show a generic listing as ""wireless caller"" when I've programmed my phone book with that number to come up under a specific name.Otherwise, the phone's great. Great reception, very clear, love the expandable handsets, the speakerphone is high quality, etc...etc..."
4,Panasonic KX-TG5672B,"This is a nice phone. Works well. But, if I had some input in the design, I would not locate the mute button and the OFF button so close together. I would make the incoming call log larger (I think you can only go back 1 or 2 numbers to call back.) I would make have the base unit handle 5 (not just 3) handsets. The speed call would be common to all phones, though you can copy ""phone books"" between units, it just another complication. The speaker phone and answer machine functions work well and controls seem fairly intuitive. The caller ID announcement can be pretty nerve-wracking, but I suppose I will eventually figure out how to turn the volume down. All-in-all, without trying other brands, I am pretty satisfied with this unit and the handsets"
