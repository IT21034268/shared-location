5,Excellent book! Gotta love this guy!,"What a valuable book. Read it cover-to-cover yesterday morning -- called my credit card companies in the afternoon and trust me -- I saved far more than the cost of the book ... including shipping! This book should be required reading for anyone who has credit debt. In fact, I think it should be added to all high school and college curriculums. Excellent purchase plus turned me on to the companion website ..."
1,Save yourself the money.,"Why would you waste money on a product that you can watch online for free on YouTube?[...]This is pretty much a ""what is cosplay for dummies."" Some of the interviews are ok, but there are odd cuts, wonky lighting, odd camera angles, and varrying sound levels. I'm pretty sure none of the anim√© footage they used was licensed. TV Tokyo, WOWOW, and Animax would probably be interested in knowing that. Really, all they have done is dummed down cosplay.Don't buy this product."
1,Terrible. Doesn't stick to topic.,"I had a chance to watch this on Youtube. It's terrible. It doesn't stick to the topic at all. Instead of being a movie about costume players, it wastes too much time on voice actors, video game players, and how anime doesn't make enough money to support it's production. Wah wah!!! Cry me a river. I love anime and I pay for it. Stop your whining and make something that is actually about costume play. This isn't. It's a complete false representation of what the movie is about. It's long, boring, and generally looks terrible. Don't waste your time or money on this movie. Watch it on Youtube for free, if at all."
1,No Good,This was a great machine for making smoothies for about 15 months. Now it is dead. It went down hill quickly...finally shredding the plastic base and smoking. The warranty is a year.
5,The Workhorse,"I work at H & R Block and I must say that this printer is perfect for our needs (over tens of thousands of pages per year). This printer has performed perfectly for over five years. The only time this printer ever complains is when it's out of paper. This printer is a true workhorse. No, you will not be able to print photographs perfectly. But, yes, this printer WILL perform admirably for tens of thousands of pages of written text documents like tax returns."
5,MARY,"This was one of the best books I have ever read...it totally made me FEEL for her and the other characters in the book. I felt a far greater appreciation for the simplistic way women were valued in Mary's time and the total lack of personal and emotional freedom available to them. I never enjoyed historical novels per se but this made me want to know more and to understand our country's evolution in a way I never have. Great book, highly recommend it to anyone. Janis Cooke Newman is a wonderful writer, this book never lagged or didn't keep me involved. I was there and I felt that the writer totally knew women and her subject of Civil War history."
3,A little too fictional,"I did learn many things, but I found myself wondering which were true and which were the author's imagination. If the description of the relationship between Mary Lincoln and her eldest son is at all true, how SAD!"
4,A book to recommend!!,"This book was recommended by a friend. Once I started it, I could not put it down ! Such a fascinating, hard life of our former first lady. I finished this book on my Kindle and instantly ordered the paperback for my mother 300 miles away!!"
4,Captivating,A side of the other half of the presidential couple we don't often see. Very powerful story about the woman Mary. Also a very interesting picture of mental illness and who and why women particularly were treated.
5,Add to cart!,I loved this book and recommend it! I became connected to Mary from the very first pages. I'm not a fast reader but was able to finish the 600 page book within 3 days! A winner and now the problem is to find another book of this quality.
4,"A complex, interesting first lady","Mary is nominally an historical novel. It is based on the life of Mary Todd Lincoln, one of the more interesting first ladies. However, rather than being too concerned with the historical drama of the time-the Civil War and Lincoln's presidency-the author is mainly concerned with the inner drama and motivations of the central character. The author shows that Mary Lincoln's life and behaviour were mainly shaped by loss-beginning with the death of her mother when she was six. She survives her husband and three of her four children. The remaining son is also lost to her when he betrays her by committing her to an insane asylum. I'm not sure how closely the Mary in this work compares to the real Mary, but the character that Ms. Newman has created is totally believable. Her actions are often selfish, self-defeating, and sometimes even immoral, but the reader can understand her and,therefore, finds her ultimately to be a sympathetic, if flawed, first lady."
4,Loved this book,did not expect much from this book but I really enjoyed it. Easy to read and I just couldn't wait to read more at the end of every chapter.
4,Mary: A Novel,"I haven't finished the book, but am enjoying it so far. Both for the language & Mary's sense of humor !!"
1,NOT A PAPERBACK!,"Despite the description as a paperback, this edition is a large hardbound book. I haven't read the book yet so my star rating is only about the misleading nature of the listing. This is a very large and heavy book. If you want a paperback, look for the other edition before you place your order."
4,Enjoyable read,It was an interesting read. It was a little wordy and long. Learning the history of that time was interesting. I had no knowledge of Mary Todd Lincoln until I read this book.
4,Mary,I became interested in Mary Todd after seeing the new Lincoln movie. I enjoyed her side of the story very much and sympathized with her much more after reading her account.
3,Mary,"We know from history she has a tough road to hoe, but this is one of the most miserable books I've ever read. I could only take so much at a time, it's that depressing. Well written, with all the elements you would expect reading of her life. but couldn't she have had at least a couple of good days. Havent finished it yet as it's hard to plough throgu but I'm getting there."
4,Mary the historical novel,"I am enjoying this book, it is very long but holds my interest. I would recommend it.It is easy reading also."
4,A good book for discussion,A good read especially if you discuss the books you read with a friend or book club. As I read this book I often had to remind myself what life was like in the mid-1800's in our country. While reading this book I frequently turned to references and other writing about the life of the Lincoln family to try to clarify what was fact and what was fiction. It is a very good story and certainly heavily based on fact.
4,Mary was a fascinating read.,Very interesting read. I was amazed to learn all of this about Mary and her family. We all need to know more about our Presidents..I suggested this one to my book club after we did Killing Lincoln.
4,One of my favorite first ladies,"First, let me say this is one great read. However, I cannot help but think Mary Todd Lincoln is turning in her grave at some of the crative liberties the author takes with the events of her life. The fact that the author is a good writer, the characters of Lincoln and Mary are likable, makes it worth the read. I have serious doubts that the proper Mary Todd of Lexington Kentucky would behave in the manner descibed by the author. Another good novel on Mary Lincoln is My Name Was Mary by Gayle Rogers. Written in the first person, it is a perhaps a more accurate picture of Mary."
5,Real Life and Faith,What a great second book. I own the first one and this is also inspiring to someone who doubts or is at the bottom due to cancer and the aftermath of it. I had the pleasure of meeting most all of the people in the previous (When God and Cancer meet) and this book. I can attest that all the stories are true (part of my story is in here) and hope that whoever reads these books will be inspired by them and see the light of Christ even in the dark times of life. Lynn may God bless you and everyone in this book. Thanks for sticking with it and writing this book.
2,Flaccid poems by an academic poet,"""a fierce and engaging quarrel with the fact of flesh"" Mark Doty made this statement in his review. This statement and others led me to believe I was about to take on a tough poet. One who would offer a comprehensive world-view; displaying all the beauty, grime, nastiness, ecstasy, noxious odors, etc...The reviews had me thinking I might have found a female Charles Bukowski.I got the anti-thesis of Charles Bukowski: an academic, who's better at word-smithing than articulating a comprehensive worthwhile idea.Sewell, strings together angst-ridden words in a run-o-the-mill, sappy way. Nothing new or interesting here. No unique perspective. I found a couple of moments where Sewell almost got something going, but they were wrapped in 2-dimensional, impotent ideas about identity, God, love.If you're looking for safe poems, get this book. If you want something electric, full of fire, and unique... stay very far away."
5,Check out my teeth now!,"Fantastic! This product leaves your teeth feeling smooth and clean. It whitens as well, so keep using it. It also leaves a fresh feeling that lasts. I am very pleased with this product and will definitely buy it again."
4,tube of tooth paste,"I received a regular tube of tooth paste not the kind shown on the picture where it looks like the insertable/seringe - kind. It works slowly, dont expect significant changes in your teeth whitening immediately, give it about 10 days and you will see a difference. It is however not minty enough for me. I would recommand it for the whitening however, perhaps its better to have received the tube of paste rather than these above shown small seringe type because you get more paste in a tube. For the price you cant go wrong. Buy and try it works."
4,Green Bay Packer Gloves,These gloves worked out great for driving in cold conditions. The textured palm provides grip while keeping your hands warm without too much bulk.
2,Disappointing,"I had trouble getting into the first few chapters of the book, so I checked a few reviews on Amazon and saw that it had 4 stars, so thought I'd try to plug away. There were moments of promise, but like the reviewer before me, I thought there were too many characters introduced without enough character development. I'd constantly find myself turning to a previous page/chapter to figure out who they were talking about. I barely made it to the end."
5,Paul Missionary Theologian,A very analytical yet inspiring book on the missionary philosophy of Paul the Apostle. Many insightful perspectives of a zeolot jew turned into a wholehearted disciple of justification by faith. Good comparison of appropriate views of the role of the law and grace in our own lives.
5,Paul Missionary Theologian,"An excellent analysis of the life of Paul and the Scripture that he authored by Dr. R. Reymond, former NT Prof. at Knox Theological Seminary in Fort Lauderdale. You begin to feel that you are a part of Paul's life and journeys. Refers to various scholars views of proper understanding of the texts along with critical words in the original language to assist in proper interpretations."
2,"It's cute, but...","Purchased about six months ago. It has a nice weight, which makes it noticeable. It is very girly and fun to wear. Except now I don't wear it. The little crystals from the four leaf clover and heart have fallen off. The back of the watch has also disappered. No hard activity, just every day normal wear. This bracelet is not well crafted. The crystals are not properly glued to the charms. As the other reviewers will notice, the crystals will fall off. The quality is disappointing. Pretty, but will only last a few months. Skip purchasing it."
4,Charmed,"There is no question taht when it does come down to Anne Klein, they definitely do know how to make clever watches that are appealing to all women and styles that are just elegant. There is no doubt in that feeling with this beautiful Swarovski SIlver-toned charm bracelet watch. I really like how clever it looks. Not only as a watch, but also as a nice bracelet that dazzles very well. It fits just any size wrist for any lady, and goes well with any outfit in desire of mind. While I do wish it could've been a little less expensive like some of there more-dazzled watches, but nevertheless it really is good for the unconventional watch owner, who wants a little more out of there watch. That is something Anne Klein knows all to well.Price: BDesign: BComfort: B 1/2-Setup: BOverall: B"
2,Uncomfortable,I work as a nurse and I never go without wearing support hose or compression stockings of some sort. So when I became pregnant my regular work hose wouldn't fit over my growing belly so I looked for maternity compression stockings. I found these and thought it was a good buy but they were SO uncomfortable. They were too tight to my liking. I suppose these will be good for pregnant women with swelling issues but for regular everyday wear you should look for lower pressure hose like 15mmHg.
2,"Beginners, look elsewhere!","I agree with many of the reviews below. This book is poorly written in a style which, while not exactly condescending, can be considered needlessly flippant. There is no real progression toward building a real tube amplifier, though there appears to be an attempt at one. You'll be confused by a series of somewhat disjoint chapters discussing various components of a tube amp and unfortunately interspersed with tube amp modifications that should have been placed later in the book. Finally, in the chapter(s) dealing building one, you realize that (a) you contantly have to look for more information in earlier chapters and (b) you do not really have a complete list of what you'll need (nor do you have a set of concrete how-to, step-by-step instructions).If not for the fact that there's some valuable information tucked away on some of the book's pages, this would be a total bust."
2,Poorly constructed ... didn't work properly from the beginning,"Cards hang up ... one side doesn't feed unless you lift them at an angle ... noisy, marks up and chews the corners of the cards. Very disappointed."
3,Not good for hanging on a wall,"I wish I had looked into the mounting options for this speaker before I bought it. The mount that comes with it allows you to rotate the speakers left and right, but there is no ability to tilt them down or up. There is only one place to screw into the speaker and it's a single screw on the bottom....make sure you look around to see if you can find a mount that can actually screw into it. All in all I'm frustrated with the setup. I bet they would look sweet if I just had them sitting on a shelf, but I don't.The sound quality appears to be fine, but I need to make some adjustments because they are being overpowered by the rest of the system at this point. If the power adjustments don't work, then maybe they are too weak to keep up."
5,Harman/Kardon Speakers still deliver...,"Great product for those who love music and every ""inch of it"" the sound it's amazing you can practically distinguish every musical instrument and vocals... it's awesome. i broadly recommend this product!"
5,Perfect for Living Room Home Theatre!,These speakers are perfect for completing a 7.1 Surround Sound system for a normal room. Buy the matching speaker stands and 5.1 system. It is all beautiful and very well made.
2,disapointed,"I was dissapointed with this lonely planet guide. Usually i travel everywhere with LP guides and find them excellent, but this ones is out of question a bad guide. I read it often enough to ensure that it may be good for hiking, but for the other things, like going out, hotel, restaurant and of the track (not hiking) it was not enough info and sometimes some not accurate info. I was very dissapointed with this LP guide. Sorry LP, but this one is BAD.thank you"
2,"Lonely Planet Bolivia, 4th edition","This latest edition of the Lonely Planet Bolivia book is decidedly retrograde compared to past editions. Lonely Planet has been famous and widely appreciated for its detailed insider information drawn from the ""grassroots"" - local people, as well as people who use the book. This book seems to be reversal from this tradition to a significant extent. For example, in the section on Bolivian Amazonia covering Madidi National Park, only one multi-national provider of guide and visitor services is mentioned. In fact there are several, some of which are very good, and even superior in some respects - depending on what you're looking for. Such resources for the region were covered in past editions but not in this one. It leads one to wonder what either the author or Lonely Planet was really trying to achieve when they published the 4th edition."
2,"out of date, but helpful for maps","There are a few good maps to get you oriented with La Paz before you go to Bolivia. Most of the restaurants do not exist anymore in this book and the stores do not either.Since there are not many travel books on Bolivia, this one is one fo the better ones, but it's a shame that there are not any better ones.Although this book is a good introduction to Bolivia and La Paz, it's definentely not going to help you much when you get there.Very outdated!"
1,Not an automatic switch,"I bought this because it was advertised to be an automatic HDMI switch. Although it works OK as a manual switch, it doesn't switch automatically for any of my sources. It just gets stuck on input 1. And since it doesn't have a remote control, this unit is completely useless to me."
2,Say What?,"I could not ""get"" this book. Where are the subtle clues to what was going on?It was like ""Turn of the Screw"" which was also obtuse. I don't know whereLawrence Block was going in this book so could not recommend it."
3,Half-baked Block,"There's a lot going on in Lawrence Block's Ariel. Adoption, insanity, crib death, adultery, a mysterious painting found in an attic, teenage angst, and more. Unfortunately, it eventually leads up to, well, not much. Still, it's an interesting book by Block that shows he didn't quite have it when he wrote it. It would have been a far different book if he'd written ten or twenty years later. This one will show Block fans how far he came."
2,READ BEFORE BUYING!!!,"I ordered this CD and received it in the mail today. It is NOT the version listed. I received the two track version instead. The version listed should have the blue and yellow cover, not black and white. Just a heads up to buyers..."
3,Almost Perfect..........Anne Klein Bracelet Watch,"The product was beautiful, well made and I would probably have been satisfied with it had I kept it.I anxiously anticipated shipment. However, I realized the product was not what I wanted only because I had specifically requested shipment ONLY if it had the charm letters AK. (Which was clearly shown in the description photo). Sadly, the charm bracelet came WITHOUT the AK charm which is the main reason I purchased the bracelet and my second attempt at ordering this particular bracelet watch ensuring my special instruction for the AK charm was included in my order. The customer service representative was very helpful and prompt in getting my return label."
2,"Nice, but heavy","I returned this watch. It was pretty, but it felt heavy on my wrist. Also, the charms twisted in a way that would need to be adjusted often to have the bracelet hang right. Return process was quick and easy. Refund was fast."
1,Not Pleased,"This watch is very unattractive. I thought it was more delicate, instead it is very brash. This suits a manly woman or a gay man."
5,A Real Good Dream Maker,"I sleep better now. No,....not really.... I sleep MUCH, MUCH better! This Amazon mattress topper is a sure way to get better dreams along with a better quality of restful sleep.I've had this topper for six months now, and it still returns to a flat, smooth surface shortly after I get out of bed.Now I need to get some pillows that are about six inches thick and made of the same material as my topper..."
2,Smells ridiculously,"Feels great, fits bed perfectly, delivered on time as described.BUT, It has been 3 weeks and it still smells Horrible!! The smell has permiated my sheets and duvet cover. It is not on my porch airing out, and I am not sure if i can get the smell out of the sheets."
3,"Good product, good price, looks like it has been used","The only reason i am rating this product low is because when I opened the packaging, half the product had a light brown shade as if it had been exposed to weather. My other cal king size mattress was in great condition. Otherwise it is very comfortable."
3,You get what you Pay for,"as far as being Pleased I am Not, also the cover I was to recieve never happened, THEY LIED!!! and wont take any complants!!!Ortho-pedic Contour Pillow With This Soft Sleeper 6.5 Queen 4 Inch Memory Foam Mattress Pad Topper, Orthopedic Contour Pillow Made From 100% Visco Elastic Memory Foam"
3,Not compatible with Intel Mini,"The hardware is of fairly good quality, but the current firmware and software are not compatible with the new Intel Mac Mini.Belkin says they are looking into it, but there is no timetable for a patch or update."
1,Read the reviews before you buy,"I didn't and I should have.Purchased this item to replace a bulky KVM switch. As soon as I set it up it started randomly muting the speakers, switching between machines and the mouse would disappear. I updated the software but it did not help.This product just flat out does not work."
1,Belkin Flip for Mac Mini flips on it's own,"I am on my second Belkin Mini Flip. I sent the first one back because it would randomly flip without user interaction. So the second one works a bit better, but it still will flip computers if the room temperature is less than 70F and will eject the CD if the temperature is above 72F.I have just ordered a IOGear MicroView KVM switch. Will return the Belkin Flip for Mac Mini to Amazon."
1,What was Belkin thinking?,"I can't believe Belkin ever let this product out into ""the wild"" - it's simply not ready for prime time yet.As others have noted, the device randomly switches and/or will not switch at all despite repeated button pushes or software switch attempts (via the Mac/PC ""switch software"").It also seems to be causing other problems with my Intel-based Mac Mini, e.g., random GUI freezes, failed boots, etc. I'm going to be returning this product ASAP.For the same money I can buy a bluetooth keyboard/mouse for the Mini (while keeping a USB keyboard/mouse physically attached to my PC) and attach both the PC and the Mini directly to my LCD monitor which has both VGA and DVI inputs.Kudos to Belkin on the form of the Flip but anti-kudos to them for its functionality!"
1,Doesn't Work,"I've had this for about 10 days and am returning it today. It randomly switches between computers, changes the speaker volume, and ejects the disk drive all on its own. A few minutes of research on the internet makes it clear that Belkin has been aware of this problem since January and continues to ship a defective product. I contacted them last Friday and they promised to get back to me, but its been a week with no response. I'm sure not very impressed with Belkin."
5,An old favorite,This book has been out of print for years. I remember it from childhood and have always loved it. A great story about being happy to be one's self.
4,good alternative snack,while no junk food or snack food is actually good for us...this one comes close to being satisfying for a salty snack with lots of cheesy taste but without the strange ingredients of the other popular cheese puff brands. I like them. Light and they do not upset the system with additives and colorings. A little too addictive with all the salt but if you can be disciplined this is a good alternative when you simply must have something crunchy and salty to eat. I would buy them again. No orange fingers and no weird carb feeling after eating them.
1,Smart Puffs Real Wisconsin Cheddar,"Boy was I dissapointed in these babies. I thought that they would taste like an actually puff, but they tasted like nothing, honestly. I love pirates booty, that is my favorite and one that I am going to stick to. These taste like a very very weark version of pirates booty, no flavor to speak of at all and not worth the money. So I would buy a bag at a store first to try before purchasing online in a large amount. Dont expect much flavor or anything form this snack, unless your into eating flavorless food."
5,delicious!,"Okay, I love my orange fingers, but if I can buy something healthier and just as good tasting THIS IS IT.I'm not even going to mention the absence of orange fingers. Oh wait, I just did. Taste just as good. Just as satisfying, and a bit cheaper... Hard to believe but with Free shipping you can't go wrong. These sell for a fortune at the grocery store."
2,Tastes good but DEVIOUS Nutritional Information,"Yes, I do like the taste of these cheese puffs. Enough said about taste. Here's the issue --> Get a bag, look at the nutritional information and ask yourself ""How many calories are in a bag of these puffs?"" Your initial answer will likely be 140 calories as that is what is printed on the bag of ""about 1"" servings. In actuality, the bag is 1 3/8 oz or 1.375 oz. So, there is over 190 calories in a bag which is more that 1/3 more calories than what you observe via a fast look at the nutritional info on the bag. I consider this devious at the very least. Now, is that not so SMART or what??"
3,"Pretty good for a 'healthy' snack, but not great","The best thing about these is the smell when you first open the bag - pure white cheddar goodness. Too bad they don't taste like that. The first few are good, but when I ate more than 5 or 6 'puffs', I got an acidic taste in my mouth. At that point, most of the cheddar flavor went away. If you're ok with eating one small handful of these, by all means, buy away - you'll be pleased. Otherwise, they're just ok, not great. At least they're not as bad for you as other snacks of this type."
3,"Good, but............","They taste GREAT but the packaging sucks! I can count on one hand the number of packages that were NOT opened, even a tiny bit. As I don't eat them every day, I only recently discovered the problem. The contents the open bags (even the ones with the tiny opening, usually in the bottom) are stale, some more so than others. If you order an entire box, check EACH bag...."
1,Not Good,These are like eating cardboard I am sorry to be negative but they are not as good not even as the reviews have said.Wasted my money by believing in the reviews.
2,Just because it's not Orange doesn't make it healthy.,"I bought these because my daughter wanted something for a school snack, had tried these in the cafeteria and said that they ""weren't bad"". Unfortunately, she had changed her mind by the time the gigantic box arrived on the doorstep. My huband and I tried them, and I feel like giving a stern punishment to the maker of these things. Besides having no discernable nutritional content, these things have too much salt, too much fake ""cheez"" powder, and no way to remove it gracefully after you'e eaten a few puffs. We don't like them, and I feel terrible dumping them on the food pantry. Perhaps I'll hide them in a large donation of healthier items."
5,A Light and Delicious Snack,"I have always loved cheese puffs but finding the perfect one was difficult.Cheeto's ""Dangerously Cheesy"" Cheese Puffs were disgusting. I do not think their ""cheese"" is even real cheese. I wanted something plainer and healthier for myself.I have tired smaller companies but they always ended getting bankrupt or discontinuing their plaining cheese puffs.Finally, I tried Smart Puffs from my local supermarket. I was a little skeptical; they were so cheap! When I got home and popped one in my mouth, I was so surprised each puff was lightly covered in cheese. Each puff was not completely crunchy; they sort of slowly melt in your mouth as you chew!I will definitely recommend anyone who looking for a healthy snack alternative this product.Pros:A healthy snackLightly covered in cheeseDelicious, too!Cons:It is so hard to put down a bag!"
4,A Mouthful of air,"This is a snack that I can't find in our local markets. I ordered a case of puffs from amazon.com on a whim. Shoping for food online was a first for me. When this huge box arrived my wife and I couldn't believe the size of it. We had a good laugh unpacking 24 bags of Smart Puffs and ate one bag full right away. The puffs tasted quite good and with the reasonably healthful ingredients they contain we did not feel guilty eating them.The puffs have a pleasant natural cheese taste. However, eating Gourmet Smart Puffs is a somewhat startling experience. Pop a couple of the puffs into your mouth chew a few times and it feels like a crunchy mouthful of cheesy air. Is that strange or what?I think I would like a bit more substance to my snacks, but I guess one can't have it all and still remain reasonably healthy. Smart puffs do not seem like junk food.Oh, by the way, your fingers do not get all yellow eating Smart Puffs. I have ordered my second case of Robert's Smart Puffs."
4,Like Cheese Jax not Cheetos,"I was expecting the Cheetos like snacks that are in the Chaos mix (which is quite yummy), but that's not what these are. They are thick and airy like Jax, not hard a crunchy like Cheetos. They taste good, but if you're looking for crunchy, this isn't it.Does anyone know if they sell the Cheetos like stuff that's in Chaos by itself?"
3,Good but not great.,"I tried Smart Puffs for the first time after buying a bag a Wholefoods. I enjoyed them so much that I decided to buy a box of 24 via Amazon.These bags don't have the same flavor....not as cheesy. As a result, the puffs are good, but not great. I plan to send feedback to the manufacturer: Pirates Brand."
3,Smart Puffs not so smart,I usually have such a good experience with this product - the last two boxes contained stale bags of puffs. This may be my last box!
1,Yuck!,I love Pirate's booty aged white cheddar and thought these would be just as good- but was I WRONG! They are awful-no pleasant crunch-no flavor at all! I am going to try the other Pirate Booty flavors in a variety pack and hope they are not as foul as these. Don't know how they got these so wrong when the aged white cheddar is so DELICIOUS!!!
3,Superfluous,"Whereas this is possibly the only in-depth study of the Arikara War in one workpiece, it can also become a tedious and laborious read for some. The author has unquestionably done his research but seems to dissect and launch so much information at the reader, some irrelevant, that it can lean towards overwhelming. Half the book merely focuses on bureaucratic, political and economical circumstances, at times immaterial, while leading up to the actual battle itself.Nevertheless, it is an insightful search into the causes and effects of culture clashing in the American West with ramifications thereof."
4,Very interesting BUT...,I was looking for a comprehensive reference particularly to my area of the world. This book has trees from all over the world and is very interesting to look at but it is missing some of the ones I wanted to look up that grow locally. As far as what is contained in the book it is all top quality. The photos and descriptions are fantastic.
1,I just hate it,it doesn't fit neither of my bird cages. I have a small and larger bird. This cover is deceiving in the picture
2,I had to pay the return shipping fee!,"This bird cage cover was much too small for our cage and the cover lets too much light through the material. I thought that I had ordered a 62 by 32 cover but for some reason I received a 52 by 22 cover. I do not know where the mistake was made.The total cost of the item plus shipping was 18.07. It cost $4.54 to ship the item to me.To return the item, I had to pay $10.20, as the seller refused to refund the return fee. We will see how much the seller is going to refund to me.In the past I returned a few items from companies and the return fee was always covered by the seller."
2,Talk about overhyped,"This book was...well, words fail me. I suspect if you are not terribly picky about what you read, you might enjoy it; it is a page-turner in the sense of not taking too long to read any single page. The stereotyping, however, blew me away, and really detracted from what might have been a better story otherwise. I further suspect a lot of folks may read this and think it describes the world the way they wish it worked, or the way they think it should work, so it's probably nice escapist fodder.But not nearly as good as some reviews had led me to believe."
5,The New Madrid Run,"I recently read the NMR and it was great! The type of novels i read range from Steven King's ""The Dark Tower"" series, Chriton's ""Jurassic Park"" and ""The Lost World"", and fantasy novels by R.A. Salvator. All the books I mentioned held my attention and interest indefinately as I read them. When I picked up ""The New Madrid Run"", I didn't know what to expect. But by the 5th chapter I was hooked. It was late when I started reading the book, so after ch.5, I retired to dreamland. The next day I brought the book to work with me and finished the remainder of the book that day! The scenario Reisig paints is a scary one! When is the earth going to go through changes the likes of which he describes? Hopefully not while I'm alive! As far as the action in the book, Reisig has everything in there I find interesting. From the tidal wave in the begining, the long journey the ill fated adventures went on, to the dog fight towards the end of the book, I was into everything!Michael........WELL DONE!"
4,An okay read . . .,"The book started out okay but then it started to get a bit unbelievable at some places. Yes, it is fiction, but some of the instances were almost laughable. Still a decent read and still worth purchasing."
5,HIGH ADVENTURE ON THE SEAS AND THE LAND.,"Loaded with adventure, violence with a purpose, romance and plenty of action, THE NEW MADRID RUN by Michael Reisig kept me reading steadily every night until the pleasantly surprising ending. I found that even my dreams became recharged with inspiration for action and survival, a surprising side-effect of having read this book. The very likable main characters have plenty of antagonists and obstacles to overcome which makes for very enthusiastic reading."
1,HORRIBLE WRITING,"I was terribly dissapointed with this book. Although the scenario Reisig creates is intriguing , I found his writing style to be among the worst I have read in a long time. Flat, obvious, and poorly constructed all around-I WANT MY MONEY BACK. Mr Reisig, please read some of the competition; Gibson, Stephenson, Williams, wood...try and measure up!"
2,"Good idea for a book, but too cliche","I was pretty excited when the plot began to unfold in the first chapter or two. However, I was repeatedly disappointed in the predictable and cliche progression of the novel. The hero is in trouble, about to be shot when the best friend dives in front of the bullet ...."
2,Don't bother,"Don't bother. If you're expecting a tense, insightful sci-fi/apocolyptic fiction, read elsewhere. If you're looking for the Old West meets cliche Hollywood action, this is more your speed. Story predictable, characters flat and stereotyped (strong silent type, hot blonde, Japanese sensei, drunken southern boat pilot, mute boy, silly Latino etc.), plot mildly tense at rare times. Not very insightful or reflective for a cataclysm book. Good for NBC movie of the week, not for good reading."
1,A sophomoric effort,"I love end-of-the-world novels, from ""Lucifer's Hammer"" to ""On the Beach"" to ""The Stand,"" I've read all I can get my hands on. But this reads like it was written for a junior college creative writing class. The characters are cliches, the action isn't terribly compelling and the apocalypse scenario at the beginning of the book is a total snore compared to others in the genre. An early example of the book's inadequacy as a story has the hero, a mere moments from seeing everything and everyone he knows destroyed in the Florida Keys, thinking about he's going to escape to the Arkansas mountains where a he and a friend bought land anticipating exactly the scenerio he finds himeself in. If he and his friend were so smart, what were they doing living in the Florida Keys in the first place? Overall, a very poorly written book that failed to hold my interest until even the halfway mark."
3,"Great Plot, Ignore the Tortured Metaphors & Dialogue","The New Madrid Run is a quick action-packed read for EOTW/post-apocalyptic fiction fans. The pacing is frantic. Every five pages someone dies or something blows up. The author is definitely is not of the Stephen King school of writing and you won't find yourself saying, ""get to the point already"". However, this is not the book to buy if you're pained by nonsensical metaphors and analogies, stiff characters, and an unbelievable time line. I have to admit that I truly enjoyed this book. You can tell the author had a blast writing it and he doesn't waste the reader's time with subtleties. It is a bit campy at times and a decent editor could have fixed most of the book's flaws (her name is given on the copyright page if you're curious)."
5,REALLY A GREAT READ!,"ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. SUPERB CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, ENTIRELY PLAUSIBLE SCENARIO. MINDFUL OF CHRICTON, BUT BETTER? HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
5,Non-Stop Action From Beginning To End,"One of the best adventure stories I have read in a long time.Once I picked up the book, I found it nearly impossible to put down.On seeing my reaction to the book, my wife, and then my 15 year old daughter, decided they better check out what it was that was keeping me so captivated.They too, were totally swept away in this fast moving adventure story.If you are tired of your everyday humdrum existance and would like to escape for a little while ,I would most highly reccomend this book. WELL DONE!"
4,"A galloping good time, sure fire family friendly fare","As an editor and former college English teacher I have read my share of first novels. NEW MADRID has all of the pluses - and none of the tedium. Apocalyptic thrillers are not normally my cup of tea but THIS ONE WORKS! Travis Christian is a man's man and a woman's dream. The plot moves, the characters live, there are good guys and bad guys and thrills and chills - by land and by sea. AND it can be shared with the family. A good read all round!"
4,It's high on adventure!,"I bought this on a whim, but I'm glad that I did. The New Madrid Run is nail-biting fun! A brisk-moving yarn that's high on adventure and low on high brow complexity that bogs down so many books. Pick it up, settle back and expect to be stuck to the chair for a while."
4,-a page turner,"tells us a story that some of us know will happen . this may be the start of a good series like the ashes books . also the book did not get slow as some do , stay away from tree stumps and axes , if you read it you will know why."
4,Quite A Ride!,"This novel is based on the theory by Richard Noone that an alignment of the planets on 5-5-2000 will shift the earth's rotating axis and possibly cause massive earthquakes and tsunamis. Well, obviously that has not happened (yet), but who knows what disasters await us in the future, man-made or not.Nevertheless, this story is a fascinating account, how the survivors meet, and how they managed in a hostile world after the loss of civilization. One of them, Carlos, will have you laughing a lot. Travis Christian is the principle character, and with him as with the others character development is excellent. Travis was an owner of a charter air service in the Florida Keys before the catastrophe, and attempts to lead a group of survivors out of harms way. At times (most of the book) the story will have you turning the pages to see what happens, as I found myself caring for these characters. If you like action, there is plenty of it here."
2,silly silly silly,"The book was a fun read, but not much substance. The sentences were a bit awkward and his descriptions left something to be desired. Cliches, cliches, cliches. The concept of the novel was intriguing, but the characters were very stereotypical. I felt like I was reading a made-for-tv movie."
2,Not too challenging,"While I like the concept of the story, I found that there were some items I didn't enjoy. First was the simplicity with the writing. The author could have been more challenging with the structure of the book. The second area was the plot was too predictable in one way and too convenient in another."
2,Did a D&D player write this?,"No offense to D&D players by the way, but as I was reading the book I couldn't help but think this was some D&D/survivalists wet dream. He's the super hero leader who gets the girl and saves the world blah blah blah. It was so campy that is was funny."
3,Fast and furious action.,"This book is great fun to read, hard to put down, and comes to a predictable but satisfying end. Those with a background in science or aviation will be a little annoyed by inaccuracies in the beginning, but fans of fiction will enjoy it overall. For a five-star, end of the world novel however, ""Lucifer's Hammer"" has no equal."
1,Yet another vote for Stereotyping,"one star.Since there are already over 50 reviews of this book, I'm chiming in to help lower the overall average.This book seems to be drawing two kinds of reviews: Glowing, wonderful, exciting romp reviews, and stereotyped, carboard, predictable, unrealistic reviews.If you have very well developed suspension of disbelief, or if you really don't know much about culture and science, then this book, like an action adventure movie, could be a lot of fun. But it has the intellectual rigor of League of Extrodinary Gentlemen. (I.E., none.) If you expect well devleoped consistant science ang culture, go read something else."
3,A decent story but the end felt rushed,"I enjoyed reading the story, however it felt a little as though the author started off really relishing the tale, but got increasingly tired of telling it as he went on. It seemed to me that just as soon as we settled in and got comfortable with the characters and world, the author wrapped it up with a sudden, rushed, conclusion. Would I recommend buying and reading it? yes. Could it have been a lot more than it was? yes."
5,Great Book,Great book and a good read to boot. This book grabs you at the beginning and holds on to the end.Yes it is predictable in spots and there is a little to much luck sometimes but overall it works.Give it a try you will leave with many new friends to remember and one or two to mourn.Philip L. McCleary
2,Neat idea but not the best construction,This book is not something your kid can read by himself in the tub. The pages don't stay open because of the stiff construction. The pieces need assistance from the parent to get them in their spots. The creatures are colorful and we use them as just floating creatures in the bath but we don't use the book at all. My son is 2 1/2 but i can see for younger kids that the pieces would be good to chew on. I wouldn't purchase again.
5,9-month old loves this book,My 9-month old loves to this book. He feels all the different textures and loves to pull the shapes out and chew on them.
5,Fantastic Book,"I bought this when my son was five months old. He still loves it at 15 months! It's durable, colorful and easy for small hands to grasp. We use it at bathtime, in the car, at the beach. He loves to take the sea creatures out and put them back in. It's loads of fun and he never tires of it."
3,Good travel toy,"Cute girly girl toy. Good for travel if you are careful to find all of the pieces in the car! Good for creative imaginative play. Nothing educational about it, unless you believe that telling stories about fairies is advancing more than creativity.Scored lower because the case ripped on the edges soon after we started using it, so now tough to contain all the pieces."
5,Anti Road Rage - Brian Green,This is an amazing album. It has everything you need to chill-out to. It has a depth that is beyond comprehension. It has most certainly worked for me. I play it all the time. Brian Green has something that most of us have lost. I look forward to his next album release. Thank you.
1,Save your money....,The WORST scissors ever! Do not waste time or money on these. All 6 pairs would not even cut cleanly on a single sheet of paper much less cardstock or pictures!!! I am now having to waste the time to send them back!
3,Scrapbooking Scissors,These were given as a gift to a 9 year old who scrapebooks a lot. She has already used them a number of times and has enjoyed them tremondously. Her parents said that having them in a book helps keep them from getting lost or strung all over the house. The scissors are very sharp and still should be monitored for the kids but they cut great and a lot of different designs.
4,how to manage your money,"Excellent book for novist to professional. As a financial planner and a Christian I find this book loaded with practical scripture verses. It deals with evereyday financial matters, questions and thougths I constantly have about what god thinks about money matters. A must if you love the Lord and want his best concerning your finances."
5,How to Manage Your Money,"This book helped me to clarify in my heart Who is the owner of all things. I know that God is the Creator, but the owner of what I have acquired? This book helps to focus the reader that God is the owner of our talents, possessions, time, and money. The spiritual insights are remarkable; and the book reveals how often God speaks about finances and what we are to do with them. Finally, the book reveals that when we commit our lives and finances to God, He will provide for our every need."
5,Photographs are wonderful and show great detail!!!!,"This paperback photo book shows in glorious color all the different Roman Legions' armor, swords, shields, etc. These are actual authentic replicas worn by re-enactors who are VERY particular about the authenticity of their period dress. The book shows many different types of Roman Legion armor, many of which are never depicted in movies, etc. It also includes nice photos of tools and gear which were used by the Roman army in everyday life. If you are a Roman army buff as I am, this book will be a delight for you!!!!"
2,Not sophisticated enough for me,Not sophisticated enough for me as I have decades of cartooning. Beginners and intermediates will probably get lots out of it.
4,Claptons' blues,"These recordings are essential for anyone's collection of Eric Clapton or British Blues.All titles were recorded before he reached total stardom with Cream. Some are with the Yardbirds, some with John Mayall, and some are small band sessions done between Eric being in groups.Just the 2 songs done with Mayall,""telephone blues"" and ""I'm your witchdoctor"" are worth the price(bargain) of the disc. The screaming (almost) one note distorted solo in ""witchdoctor"" is amazing and the solo in ""telephone"" has to be one of the best he ever recorded. These were recorded during the time that the ""Clapton is god"" graffiti appeared in London and listening to the intensity of his playing helps you understand why.Awesome music."
3,Average but entertaining..,"Maybe it's because I finished 'The Tragedy of X' before, this one didn't impress me with better plot. Yet, in terms of entertainment, it's still worth reading."
1,down the slide with Ruth Rendell,"As a fan of Rendell's twisted psychological novels of the past, i found her latest novel tedious with adolescent characters all bent on some weird escapade. it was hard to follow, uninteresting, so I dropped it a third of the way through. Joan Cremin"
5,A tantalizing gem from Ruth Rendell,"A juvenile game and an overly imaginative adult who believes cryptic messages are being left by members of a criminal gang slowly builds up to classic suspense and a twist at the end that hints at how juveniles can ""graduate"" into the criminal life. The story is slow` in development, but the journey is vastly enjoyable which is generally the case with this author."
1,WORST BOOK EVER BY RENDELL,"This book did not even come close to resolving the conflicts developed in this story. What happened to John, Jennifer, Martin, Mungo, Augus? There was something going on there that was not wrapped up. Are we supposed to think Charles's killing of Peter the END GAME. THIS END [was not good]."
3,Still trying to discover the plot...,"I'm 245 pages into the book, and I'm still not sure what the point of the book is. Also, there are various parts in the book that I'm not sure why they even need to be in the book, kind of like babble. Parts of it are ok, but then other parts make me want to fall asleep."
3,Good start to a great trilogy,This is easily the weakest of the 3 books as it gets bogged down in far too much detail. Worth reading because the Baroque Cycle gets stronger and is a truly remarkable work.
2,Stephenson loses his style,"As a huge fan of nearly everything by Stephenson, and someone who enjoyed reading even those books of his I wouldn't recommend to others, I was shocked by how devoid of life this novel was. What I considered the ""trademark"" of Stephenson was his fast pacing and verve...no matter what the subject, in a Stephenson novel, things _move_. His writing was a bit like a white water raft trip--you might have been getting drowned in information, but you were having a great time doing it at breakneck pace. This novel has lost that style, so the flood of information is simply rising inexorably toward boredom. Even a move from Waterhouse to Shaftoe, while it helped, did not bring back that sense of spark that is Stephenson. This is a competent work from any other novelist, but it's a disappointment to find that one of our most talented writers spent so much effort on something dozens of other people could have written equally well."
2,Not worth it...,"I had read all of NS's books written before this. I liked them all better than this. In particular I liked Snow Crash, The Diamond Age, and Cryptonomicon. While he obviously put a lot of effort into researching and writing this book and the succeeding two volumes, this does not compare with the 3 I mentioned above. It has some funny moments, but drags on without any real meat to keep you interested in what is going to happen to the characters. Yes, some ancestors of characters in Cryptonomicon appear, but without much point except to share a common name.Unfortunately after anxiously awaiting this book's release, it was a big let-down. I will be waiting to see the reviews on #2 before I buy it.What I am looking forward to is what comes *AFTER* this three volume saga comes to its conclusion."
4,an adventure epic for geeks and lovers of historical fiction,"This epic story is an amazing blend of ideas from the history of science and adventure. The tempo of the writing is more like an adventure story. ""Quicksilver"" is probably most appealing to geeks and those who enjoy historical fiction. When you really like something it's natural to think everyone else will love it too, but they won't. Quicksilver and the rest of the trilogy make for a longgggg read, but it sure doesn't feel like it. Long and enjoyable like Lord of the Rings on film, sweeping in scope, a real epic. Neal Stephenson is one of my favorite authors. If you've never read one of his books I'd reccommend ""Cryptonomicon"" or ""Snow Crash"" to read first."
4,Not Your Typical Historical Fiction,"This was my first Stephenson book. I came at it as someone interested in history rather than science fiction. As a work of historical fiction this book has many strengths. The center of the book isn't the characters or the plot, it's the environment. The book is bursting with historical detail, mostly about England in the late-1600s but Europe and Boston too. I felt transported, and for me that more than justifies the 900+ pages.However, some of the book was undoubtedly slow going. I enjoyed the detail about natural philosophy and scientific discovery, but I'm not sure other historical fiction genre fans will care. The plot is fascinating in an intricate, slowly unfolding way, but if you want to read a fast-moving murder mystery like The Dante Club, spend your time on something else."
1,Disappointing,I was SO disappointed by this book. I love Stephenson's science fiction (The Diamond Age blew me away) but I just could not get through this random assembly of historic nuggets masked as a novel. Impossible to finish.
2,Do I even want to finish this?,Actually I did but I had to constantly ask myself this the entire time. I have read and loved every other Stephenson book which is the only reason I forced myself to finish this one. And this is just the 1st of three?? It is going to be tough waiting out two more of these things to read more of my favorite author!!
1,Tragic Waste of Talent,"I have patiently watched Stephenson progress to be one of the best writers of our time. Cryptonomicon, I thought, was his arrival and we would be blessed with brilliant novels for years to come. I waited for his next book, bought it the first time I saw it (in hardcover which I never do), and took it home to relish the pages.I really tried. And then I realized I was getting lost in description. The characters all seemed of the same mind. Things wandered, got lost, got described, got lost.I am tragically dissapointed in Neal Stephenson. What a waste of our good time and his. To have expended this much effort and end up with the sloppy hodgepodge of a novel is a great loss.Where the heck is his editor? Why did he/she allow him to do this? He'll never live it down and it will take a real turn around to bring me back into the Stephenson Clan."
2,Like being force fed an 18th century 'Where's Waldo?',"This book is not interesting. It is a novel with no plot, no character development, just disorganized narrative about 18th century science and philosophy. If Neal Stephenson can't be bothered to structure his novel so that it has interesting plot and character development, I can't be bothered to finish reading it. If the development of Locke and Newton's ideas are of interest to you, read some philosophy of science."
2,"Slogged through it, but can't recommend it.","The absence of a plot makes this otherwise exquisitely crafted novel quite boring, frankly. I expected better, having read all of Stephenson's other works."
1,Puzzlement bordering upon nausea,"After reading some of the reviews on here about this book, I was quite hopeful. As it happens, I'm actually a scientist who loves trivia and has a special place in the heart for the 17th century - it boded well! But 350+ pages later, I just couldn't force myself to keep going. So, in all fairness, I shouldn't even be writing this review. Except here's the thing: this book is so poorly written that I just HAD to. It's not the length, and it's not the content, it's just the writing style which makes this feel like a Herculean labor rather than anything enjoyable or even ""educational."" As far as I'm concerned, the only thing this book is good for is for throwing it at people you hate."
1,Disappointing,"Inpenetrable. All of the characters' ""characters"" blend together (besides having similar names), and the book has no plot. As a fan of his previous works I am disappointed."
1,Unrealistic,"I read this book not knowing at all what to expect. After a few pages I gave up. Why? At the beginning, the protagonist meets √† 8-year old kid and starts chatting. What do they talk about? You would think it would go somewhere along those lines :""hey kid, what's to see in this town?""""depends, what are you looking for?""""Any good place to eat/sleep/whatever""""I'm not sure but people usually go to the market, this way""Right? Wrong. Here they start talking about history. And the kid (who doesn't go to school) speak like a 40-year old history-buff! Darn! It could be ok if the discussion was interesting. But to me it was boring as hell. So I closed the book, and next! Maybe that was a mistake, maybe the remaining would have been better. But why drudge when one as som many right-from-the-start enjoyable books?By the way, I did read Anathem from the same author (which is a book that was difficult to read but really enjoyable). So I'm not totally stupid. But this book felt like eating wood chips."
1,Doorstop,"The story limps along with uninteresting characters which is a shame given that one of them is Sir Isaac Newton. I was looking for a fun, historical adventure and thought the trilogy would give me some good reading this winter. If you are looking for something more fast paced with interesting characters then I'd recommend Bruce Alexander's sir john fielding series."
1,The most boring book ever written,"With Snow Crash & Cryptonomicon, Stephenson proved he could be entertaining & instructive at the same time. Both books are full of provocative ideas & impart a good deal of interesting historical information, without ever slowing down the story.In Quicksilver there are no ideas, no story, and above all no entertainment. It is a catalogue of names & dates, and it is as boring as reading the telephone book. In fact it resembles nothing so much as one of those bulleted study guides for a standardized multiple-choice college history exam: ""The Peace of Westphalia was in the year...."". Except the study guide would be a lot shorter.Stephenson's ego seems to be completely out of control, and his publisher must have a death wish. Can there really be two more volumes of this tedium....what a waste of talent."
2,Sigh...Ignorance and Humor at else's expense,"While reading certain passages did give me a laugh, I have to say that it is largley Anglo-centric and Stephenson introduces numerous historical inaccuracies in an attempt to seem humorous and well-educated. He often does this at the expense of other countries in a ""subtle"" way. While one may argue that this is a work of fiction, this is certainly not a worthy excuse since the author's intent is clearly to place fictional characters in a factual historical context. While someone strongly knowledgable of history may leave with a good laugh at the inaccuracies, most readers will leave with a poor substitute for real knowledge, possible reinforcing previously held erroneous beliefs. This is not to say that the book is not often entertaining."
2,First time for everything,"I never thought I'd see the day when I thought Neal Stephenson's latest selection was boring. Now most hardcore fans will dismiss me as a dilettante, intimidated by the length or intellectual breadth of his novel. Not so. I'm the nerd who pushes Neal on all my friends and family. But with the random chuckle occurring on every, say, 20th page, and fabulous idea each, oh, 30th page, THIS IS NOT your classic Stephenson. Remember Diamond Age, folks? When you couldn't believe how each page held a cool new idea? Forget about it. If I can't do this, and I've pulled allnighters for Neal in the past, then I certainly would recommend newcomers stay far away from this. I know, I know, you old time fans will read it regardless of this review. But maybe I can save you a shred of money and dignity by suggesting you check it out at the library. Don't worry, you're not missing anything by having to wait another 2 months."
5,"Big, but Glorious...","Stephenson is one writer who remembers what most other genre authors have forgotten: you used to actually learn something new from every book, every short story, every novella in the Science Fiction universe. This book is historical fiction, not science fiction, but it conveys the same sense of discovery and wonder that I used to get from Larry Niven novels or Clarke stories. That's not surprising; to many Americans, the past is now as foreign and strange a place as the future seemed in the 1950s, and any author who plumbs history's depths as thoroughly and honestly as Stephenson does here is bound to create an engaging yarn. This book is set in the late 1600's, and is a sort of prequel to his book Cryptonomicon. Sharply, wittily drawn characters and expansive explorations of European science and society make this a welcome summer read. Almost as welcome as its sequel..."
5,"come on guys, it's marvellous","ok, so stephenson gets a little carried away with lists and the prose is so dense at times you need Jack's Turkish sword to cut your way through, but it has all the delight in the systems and processes of the mind & of society of his previous books--and it's just as funny--besides being a jolly good stab at 17th and 18th century style.to those who criticise stephenson's characterisation, i submit that his characters have never been real people (diamond age, anyone?) and they're all the better for it.stephenson's writing is getting richer by the book. so quicksilver's historical period is perhaps more distant from the pan-geek consciousness than cryptonomicon's--go, i charge you, embrace the challenge."
1,Don't waste your time,"I used to think that a New York times bestseller would have to be at least remotely interesting. I was wrong. This book is filled with bad metaphors, fourteen letter words that can only be found in a thesaurus, and some words that are just made up, but supposed to sound like archaic english. Most of the narration is present tense, which is very distracting, and there is essentially no characterization aside from the portrayal of several of the characters as sadomasochists. If they were alive today they would sue Stephenson for liable. I threw the book in a LAX trash bin at about the half-way point. Don't waste your time."
1,Present tense ruins book,"This is just a warning that the book is written in the present tense. Personally I couldn't read it, I just wanted to correct everything I read.It's a shame, I guess Stephenson was trying to be creative but that's not the way to do it."
2,I tried to read it...,"I tried to read it-- even forced myself for awhile, hoping some kind of plot would eventually develop, but finally I gave up a little less than halfway through. The description of the book made it sound fascinating-- it wasn't. Nothing happened and the characters were flat.I give the author props for his research into the history of modern science, and that's the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one."
5,Interesting Historical Narrative,An extremely well written view of a period when science was making rapid progress under what we would consider primative conditions. I will say that there are times when Neal Stephenson could have used 500 words and maintained reader interest but chose to use 2500 and risk putting us to sleep.
3,"New style - great, but not what I expected","In his books, Neal Stephenson usually has some fantastical/scifi elements that make the stories very interesting. Quicksilver is a break from his style. He delivers an amazingly well written historical novel, but it wasn't what I was expecting based on his other works. The sectioning of the book into basically 3 different storylines also causes your interest to reset during the book, making it very much NOT a page-turner. At 900ish pages, this is very bad. I would tear through his other books in days, this one took months as I got distracted by more interesting books."
2,Definitely a low point for Neal,"Speaking as somebody who loves every single word of Neal Stephenson's previous work, I had high expectations for Quicksilver. Unfortunately, I found it to be a tremendous letdown. Halfway through the enormous chronicle of nothing in particular, I realized that it was becoming more and more difficult to turn each new page. Eventually, I put the book down and haven't picked it up since."
1,What a Let-Down!,"I previously considered myself a HUGE Stephenson fan but after reading Quicksilver I'm not even sure I will read the next 2 installments. The length didn't bother me, because I kept expecting it to get better (it didn't). I simply could not get past the recycling of major Cryptonomicon characters in a slightly different setting. Why use the exact same character in the exact same way, all the way down to the exact SAME NAME? Everytime the Shaftoe character came up I was re-disapointed. I am starting to feel Snowcrash was a fluke."
1,What are you guys smoking?,"This book is a disaster. There is no coherent plot. The characters are unsympathetic and one dimensional. I labored to read this book because of my affection for what Stephenson has done before. However, this book is a diaster of unimaginable proportions. Three years to write this.William Martin does a better job describing the emotional impact of the plague in 20 pages in Harvard Yard than Stephenson does in over 100. A total waste of words and wood pulp. Is it possible for me to convey my anger at having sacrificed far too many days with this worthless book published solely on the merits of the authors previous works which are high?The thought of two more volumes before something of value is again published has put me off Stephenson."
1,A self-indulgent piece of ponderous junk,"Neal Stephenson seems to have escaped the bonds of courtesy to his readers with ""Quicksilver"", which is a sprawling, thoroughly uninteresting and undisciplined waste of paper.The book is simply four or five times too long for what happens in it. Alas, if it were compressed to a quarter of its size, the fact that nothing interesting actually happens would be all too clear. Although Stephenson has always put plot in second place to amusing and exciting set pieces, the set pieces are staggeringly long-winded in ""Quicksilver"", and there's no plot to speak of, beyond ""wow, a lot of stuff happened during the Enlightenment"".This book is awful beyond words. It deserves to be a failure, and with any luck, Stephenson will accept the advice of an editor next time out."
4,Worth the Effort,"Normally, I plow through a 900-page book in a few days, but this one has had me tied up for weeks. It's extremely dense with information, and between the extensive historical detail, and Stephenson's exceptional talent for plot, I've been savoring this one. Still about 100 pages left to tear through and I'm looking forward to getting home and finishing it off. The start of things seems slow, but don't let that dissuade you...things start coming together nicely, and no doubt, start setting the stage for the next book in the Baroque Cycle."
3,Not the best book for the Car,"I purchased the MP3 audio version of this book. The review applies only to that.I listen to books on my daily commute. This book, beautifully written, detailed and complex, was difficult to stay with and fully apreciate in that environment. The story is wonderful - I want more, but I think I will READ rather than listen to the rest of the series."
3,Slow,"Okay book but I feel like it needed some editing. The storyline and characters didn't really grab me, but the historical information was interesting and the writing was smooth. The story moved very slowly and there wasn't much to the plot. I'll probably read the rest of the series, but I don't think I'll rush out to get them."
3,"Slow start, an anticlimatic but still a good book","Despite a slow start, and a lack of any sort of closure whatsoever at the end of 916 pages, it was still a good book. The fact that I want closure says at least something about the book and is probably what Neal Stephenson was attempting considering that this is only Volume 1 of the Baroque Cycle. This book will eventually earn its true reputation once the series is complete and we know what role it plays. So my recommendation is to wait for paperback, or wait until the series is complete to determine if Quicksilver is worth reading."
3,***WARNING! Two totally different editions!***,"The ""Paperback"" listed here is the trade paperback of Quicksilver: VOLUME 1 of The Baroque Cycle.It is about 900 pp. and contains Books 1-3: ""Quicksilver,"" ""King of the Vagabonds,"" and ""Odalisque.""The ""Mass-Market Paperback"" is a different book.It is only the first 340 pp. (Book 1) of the trade paperback."
1,An Artist's Indulgence,"When Neal Stephenson finished Cryptonomicon, he was so in love with some of the characters he created he decided to indulge his ""phant'sies"" by allowing them to live again in a work of heavily researched historical fiction. Thus the Baroque Cycle was born.All in all, I found the book to be excruciatingly hard to read. I did not finish it.1) The parade of Famous Important Personages was mildly interesting at first; then the list grew so long I quit caring.2) The sprinkling of ""ye olde authentik Engishisms"" in non-narrative descriptive text just made feel like I was swimming through treacle.This is the only work of Stephenson's I have not enjoyed.[Edited down with 62% less hyperbole!]"
4,Dense but engaging for history of science fans,"Similar to Stephenson's dense and detailed style in Cryptonomicon, he weaves his multi-generational characters into the pivotal events of history. Such 1000+ page books cannot be read in the few week borrowing time frame of library loans, and the physical size and weight of the hard cover make this a perfect tome to read on the Kindle especially with alot of travel scheduled. I hope I can remain engaged to complete all 3 books in the Baroque Cycle."
4,"Oddly enough, I liked it.","Short on story, long on details; somehow, I still liked it. The narration was excellent. I can't say how, but I liked it."
2,"dull, dull, dull","I won't take much of your time. Stephenson has become a falling star. I believe he is regurgitating each and every fact he read at the library, thinking that to personalize them will make them interesting. Nothing could be farther from the truth. This book could have been half its size and the little he actually said would still have come across. Frankly, I'd rather read a treatise on economics than another one of these. And Mr. Stephenson, I used to look forward to your books with the thirst of an addict; now I don't think I will be paying any more attention."
1,drivel,"I have been a fan of Neal's for sometime. I have enjoyed a number of his works. Quicksilver is one that I did not enjoy. The only delight was in the first couple of chapters. These first few chapters were interesting and engaging. After that it goes down hill fast. While I have an interest in science, philosophy, and history I found the articulation of these wonderful subjects very much lacking in Quicksilver. The premise is wonderful, but written badly and the characters becom wooden and puppet like. It hurts to say this, because I truly enjoyed Neal's other works. Clearly, I would not recommend this book."
2,Well-Researched Mess,"Stephenson loves his subject and there are flashes of the old Stephenson genuis, but this one just didn't have enough humor, plot, or excitement. I plodded through hundreds of dull narrative. Other historical novelists have done so much better jobs. This novel almost seems like the work of an immature novelist trying to get his sea legs. It's too bad because I really loved Crytinomican and Snow Crash. Try Moorcock's The War Hound and the World's Pain as well as Wolfe's New Urth series. They have more fantastical elements, but I think they have more action and believability. Par Lagerkvist's The Dwarf comes to mind, too. Also, just reading non-fiction history on the 17th century is more stimulating, for instance; Tomlinson's biography of Samuel Pepys."
3,"lot of fiber, nut so much fruit and nut","yeah, Stephenson can seriously turn a phrase, so many delights, but it's too much unjuicy between the fun bits. I wonder if there's some wink wink encryption in all the scene chewing, that someone could crack and then find the real sauce. Don't think I'll be going for the other two books."
3,Too much oink,"I agree with Mr. Green's review completely. ""Quicksilver"" starts out decently but soon becomes a bleeding oinking pig of a book. A few hundred pages in, I found myself skipping twenty-page-long rambling kitchen-sink descriptions.I was a huge fan of Snowcrash, enjoyed Cryptonomicon and Diamond Age (which sometimes veers into the territory that Quicksilver wallows in). But in this case, more is not better. I suggest Stel Pavlou's book instead."
3,I'm not sure what Neal is trying to accomplish with this,"I really liked Cryptonomicon, as the other reviewers of this book likely did. One of the ""cool"" factors of Cryptonomicon was how Stephenson used asides to talk about interesting trivia that us geeks find interesting; unfortunately, he goes way overboard with this in Quicksilver. His countless tidbits and asides regarding people and places of the 16th and 17th century simply don't work. None of us readers lived during that time, and I can say with assuredness that few of his readers are full blown Renaissance-age scholars. The result: Neal's ""clever"" trivia is a meaningless and boring tedium for the average reader of this book.I see what he's trying to accomplish here, but he could have probably accomplished it with 400 less pages of distracting statistics and biographical sketches. He obviously did a lot of research on his time period, and that shows in this book -- but his delivery could use some work."
2,Disappointing - was this written by the same Stephenson?,"I read most of the book, but only because i was hoping that it would get better. No such luck. The couple of chapters dealing with the development of natural philosophy (which i liked) just aren't able to save this book from being, well... boring. After about 700 pages of dead wood, the book just crawls to a stop. If you like long-winded, pointless dialogues, disconnected plot twists and repetitive pseudo-philosophical rants, you may like this book. Otherwise, save your time and money and stay away."
2,too wordy .. didn't go anywhere,"I read the whole book waiting for something to happen .. except it never did.The descriptions are very animated but unbearably long. The plot is complex and doesn't really connect in a very interesting way.Overall, I had high expectations after Cryptonomicon, and was really disappointed. I am not sure I will continue to the others in the trilogy..."
5,Awesome,"If you are a nerd, this is the book for you. Although, I suspect most people who fit the former description will not need to be told."
2,Don't buy this edition.,"This product is only the first section of the first full book of The Baroque Cycle, and seems to have been introduced to the market just to double-sell parts of this series.Look instead for the version of Quicksilver that's listed as 'the first Volume of The Baroque Cycle', unless you want to spend more time and money hunting down the other books, The King of the Vagabonds, and Odalisque just to finish off the full first Volume."
2,Detailed but turgid,"I had great expectations for this book, having read all of Neal Stephenson's previous books, but was disappointed by this. Although he has obviously invested immense hours in research, the book comes across as stiff and overly ornate - much like baroque design.In particular, Stephenson's smart-alecky dialogue, that worked to great effect in Snow Crash, is merely grating here, as are the anachronisms that the characters utter from time to time.As for the characters themselves, I found it very difficult to care about any of them, which made it very difficult to involve myself in the story.I really had to wonder what the benefit was of creating a gargantuan work that appeared to say so little; as if mere volume could substitute for depth."
2,A missed opportunity,"One can understand the wish of the author to provide the framework showing the primitive circumstances within which the great minds of western civilisation had to live and work. The book suffers however from an overabundance of superfluous detail ( some of which as far my country is concerned is factually incorrect)and in parts almost becomes a tourist guide to 17th century Europe. In other parts it falls into ""best-sellerish"" plots, and thereby misses the opportunity to demonstrate how these great minds actually arrived at the discovereis that in many instances changed history.I will certainly not puchase volumes two and three. For those interested in Leibniz I can recommend ""the courtier and the Heretic"" by Matthew Steward (Norton)"
3,New paperback edition,"Not a review...I just bought this paperback that is ""only"" about 400 pages. Is this an abridged edition, or simply the original further subdivided?I love Neil Stephenson but I can understand the complaints of many reviewers here that find these latest works brilliant but tedious. If you are going to publish works of a thousand pages, you had really better have an exciting story to tell."
2,"Lots of reading, not much payoff.","I quit. 774 pages read, 150 to go. This has been a great waste of time. I love historical fiction but this story takes a lot of work with no payoff. For example; the female protagonist saves William of Orange from French dragoons in Holland by riding bareback across the country side, rowing a longboat out to sea, drowning a dragoon who tries to board the boat and he skips the thanks but tells her to go seduce a lesbian friend, so that she can, no doubt, send him more encrypted letters that talk about Court life. That is tne big action and occurs 700 pages in. Before that there is no action at all. Take a pass on this."
1,Merrily we Slog Along!,"I had great hopes for this thick wad of paper from Mr Stephenson. What a disappointment! Not only were the characters flat, they were recycled from Cryptonomicon! I slogged through about 700 pages before sending it along to the used book store for trade credit.So sorry to hear that there related texts to follow at six month intervals: looks like I will be taking a Stephenson Sabbatical!"
3,Still reading it,"I'm still reading the book but so far it's pretty good. It starts off a little slowly, but it's starting to get very interesting."
1,Disappointed,"I gave this book one star not because it is a poor book, but because Neal can do a lot better than this rather boring story. Asking the Muse for help at the beginning of the novel was a tip off. In reading his plea I could feel that he was already on uncertain ground, whereas in all his previous absolutely brilliant novels Neal was balls to the wall full on in creativity and excitement. Is it success? Pressure to continue the winning streak? Please come back to us, Neal. Please don't write these dreaded 2 additional promised books along these same lines."
3,I'm trying...,"I'm trying to get through this one. I've put it down for a while, but will pick it up again, I know.It's not as fun as Cryptonomicon, but I'm willing to ride it out."
1,Whoa!,"What the heck was this all about? Uggh. I just finished it and I am at a loss as to why I continued past page 100. As much as I love Stephenson's other books, I was just bored with this one.Book 1 and Book 3 were both incredibly boring but Book 2 was interesting.I am very disappointed with Quicksilver and have no intention of reading volumes 2 and 3 of ""The Baroque Cycle."""
1,Where have all the editors gone???,"I should have read more reviews on Amazon.com before Costco got my money. I took the book back, which as we all know is a huge commitment of time at Costco because I wasn't about to keep this tome or even donate it to the Library, thereby filling up future used booksale shelfspace. Boring, tendentious, patronizing, and somewhat silly, I agree with the reviewer who suggested Neal take a year off and go watch waves and backpack. Save your money."
2,Great Idea but desparately in need of a strong editor,"I feel terrible writing this review after having loved Stephenson's other works. Quicksilver is simply a work run amok, there is a great and interesteding story here -- like Crytonomicron. But unlike that book, which I never noticed was over 1000 pages, I have had to work through ponderous prose and descriptions that are not particularly helpful. It needed an editor to cut this book down to size. My concern is that Stephenson's earlier success may have dampened his ability to tell a good story rather than get caught up in himself. I really do not want to think of him as the 21st century james michener but he needs to hone his craft better to avoid becomming that style.If the other volumes of the trilogy are of the same size, then I will pass."
3,"Straight historical fiction..,","Like many, I have enjoyed Neal Stephenson's previous works. Quicksilver was a letdown because it just goes over historical events that have been written about numerous times and from every conceivable angle. No new ground is broken here. Sure, there are some trademark Stephenson smart-ass paragraphs thrown in but they come across as attempts to liven up fallow ground.I don't begrudge Mr. Stephenson's trip into historical fiction but I really hope he chooses not to dwell here for the rest of his career."
2,"A Long, Hard Slog","Like many others who have reviewed this book, I am a long time Neal Stephenson fan and eagerly placed a prepublication order as soon as I heard about it, in spite of the mixed reviews it was receiving. Well, that turned out to be a mistake. The book is amazingly devoid of plot, the historical context is overdone (a certain amount is expected and fun, but this was ridiculous), and the characters are not engaging. I only stayed with it through the end because I was hoping something would happen to entice me to at least sample the next volume. Alas, nothing did. So I will wait on the sidelines while the life cycle of The Baroque Cycle plays out, and then hope that Neal can redeem himself in a future effort.On the positive side, my wife commented that I looked very studious walking around with this massive tome tucked under my arm. That hasn't happened since my graduate school days."
2,A disappointment.,"What is it with authors who disdain the use of straightforward unambiguous language and story lines in deference to obscure pedantic meanderings which are calculated to display their quirky intelligence? I loved Cryptonomicon and couldn't wait for Stephenson's new tomb, but I have been sorely disappointed. I love history when it is told in an engaging and enlightening style. This author however loves to throw out endless historical references without any explanation or context leaving this reader to scratch his head in confusion and to continually reference the Encyclopedia Britannica. This was difficult heavy going made purposely so by the author. All of the gratuitously meretricious meanderings might have been somewhat more tolerable had Stephenson managed to create characters who one cares about. But he failed in this regard as well. This book is a far cry from Cryptonomicon. Beware."
2,Misses the mark,"(Spoiler warning!)I read and absolutely loved The Cryptonomicon. I had high hopes for Quicksilver but alas I was disappointed. While written in the same style as the Cryptonomicon the threads are too nebulous and fluid.An example is that there's a lengthly section about silver mining and how a Natural Philosopher (scientist) and the enigmatic Enoch Root discover a way to economically coax silver from silver mine dregs. So the group travels to Amsterdam (or someplace, I forget) to get mercury, a necessary ingredient for the silver reclamation process. We never hear about it again, except for a single one-line reference 100 pages later.The book is full of threads like this that go nowhere or are too subtle for my limited intellect.Quicksilver just didn't gel for me."
3,"Tough, tough read but worth it in the end","Neal Stephenson rates as one of my favorite all time authors (I've read all his books) but this one lets me down a bit. Stephenson makes every attempt to enlighten the reader with the customs of late 17th century Europe, but at times it's as if he's trying too hard. I've actually had to put the book down on 3 occassions to give my brain a rest and read another book. However, the book picks up the pace towards the middle (gets bogged down again at the 3/4 mark) and finishes strong. And though I have yet to read the next book in the Baroque Cycle (The Confusion), I've heard all the detail in Quicksilver pays off quite handsomely."
4,Epic,"This book is not only long, but dense and full of great information. You really get your money's worth here. Stephenson does an excellent job of introducing the origins of modern science and finance, and paints some of the original members of the Royal Society in an interesting light. The author certainly did his homework for this book and shows that off, too, but you'll still find some of the classic Stephenson irreverence embedded in a few of the characters and situations in the novel (e.g. Jack Shaftoe)."
2,Only for some readers,"I couldn't finish this book. I forced myself to finish the first third of the book about Waterhouse and Newton. The second third, about Half-cocked Jack and Elisa, was significantly better. But when it deviated back to complicated politics, I had to put it down for good.I admit I might not have exemplary reading comprehension skills, but this book is very hard to read. You must know a lot about math and science, a lot about European history and politics and must be able read deeply into nuanced dialog to be able to understand this novel. I understood about 40% of the Waterhouse book and 60% of the Jack book. Stephenson's writing is good and witty, but also pretty difficult and long-winded at times.This book is not for everyone. Anyway, read the diversity of reviews on this book and you'll be able to tell if this book is for you."
2,More than a little Baroque,"I too was greatly anticipating Stephenson's newest work, only to find myself disappointed. I didn't find the book a difficult read, per se (admittedly, I'm on of those who love Umberto Eco), but simply found the prose overly dry, the characters not compelling, and the plot nonexistant. While admittedly a plot isn't necessary to a great book, it would help with the pacing of what looks to be a 3000 page work--particularly from an author who has a gift for complex plotting.In general I love reading history, although mostly nonfiction, but somehow the highly detailed and microscopically rendered descriptive text fell flat for me. I forced myself to finish it, only to wish I was one of those who can so easily toss aside a book they've invested hours in already. It seems to be an either/or proposition--love it or hate it--so I suggest a quick perusal of the text before you invest $30 in a book you may be less than thrilled with."
2,Long winded and boring.,"While Neal Stephenson's books are generally really fantastic- this book is nearly unreadable. I have suffered through it once, years ago, but I decided to try it again. I hoped it would be great. However, it is not great. Its boring and unreadable. Read Anathem instead."
3,Re-packaged as an eight-volume set,"Beware, this edition only contains one third of the original first volume of the Baroque Cycle. Spend an extra few dollars and get three times as many words!"
4,Three Weeks,"Since other reviewers have said it all, I will just add that it took me 3 weeks to read Quicksilver and it was time well spent.There is everything a reader could possibly want (and much, much, more): descriptions of lead mining, analyses of stock markets and trading, broad farce, hilarious witty dialogue, suspense, drama, intrigue.Yes, I admit to skimming over portions (I'll read them more carefully next time). I'm not a fan of farce, whether it's Shakespeare or Stephenson. And I couldn't care less about the workings of trade and margin selling. I'm sure other readers had other portions that received less-than-intense attention.So what? It's a wonderful book and I'm looking forward to volumes 2 and 3. At least, I think I am (after all, I want to find out how Daniel ended up in the colonies, and then what happened when he returned to England in 1713). Onward and excelsior!"
4,A great journey ...,"... though a long one, with many digressions that might not be for everyone. I absolutely loved this book, and being fascinated by the time period and the scientific questions on hand, never felt bored or confused. This series is one of my favorites, and I would give this first book 5 stars, if it weren't for the fact that part two: The Confusion was (shockingly) even better."
3,Get out of the house. Just. Get. Out. Of. The. House.,".If ""Paradise Lost"" was, as Johnson said, a book which no one wished was longer, I wonder how the Doctor would feel about this. Quicksilver is a 900 page part one of a trilogy, and if you do the math, you have to make sure you're enjoying this as you go along. This is a long trek, and if you're not enjoying it, put it down. That's what I'm doing, after 150 pages. I don't like the characters, their development, the plot, or the style. Mind you, I'm not put off by the erudition (as friends have asked me), because I can enjoy Gaddis and Pynchon; it's more that the erudition seems gratuitous. The characters observe, and think, but I'm seeing very little emotion here, and reading it is laborious as a result.I imagine others will disagree with me, and if your tastes run to novels of ideas like Harry Mulisch's ""The Discovery of Heaven,"" then maybe you will enjoy this. But I am not, and so I am just leaving the house."
2,Is there a proofreader in the house?,"Please. I loved Cryptonomicon, but I can't go on with this. A writer who doesn't know the difference between ""immigration"" and ""emigration,"" and a publisher who lets that kind of mistake into print? I could try to get past the droning, clunky exposition, but the insults keep piling up."
2,Not Cryptonomicon.,"After reading Cryptonomicon I wanted to read the Baroque Cycle. I thought I would be engaged from the start, so I waited until the three books were published before getting Quicksilver.It is not doing it for me. I am on page 635 and it is like reading Don Quixote.I won't read the rest of the Baroque Cycle after (or if) I finish this one."
1,So disappointed,"After thoroughly enjoying Cryptonomicon, I was eager to read Neal's new trilogy. But after 350 pages, I've just given up. So far, there's only about 50 pages of real plot and story and 300 pages of mind numbing (mostly) scientific trivia dating from the 17th century.Cryptonomicon had a rocking story, also filled with trivia, but that trivia was an interesting diversion from main story and blessedly concise. If you enjoyed Cryptonomicon, be very wary about buying Quicksilver."
2,I didn't finish it,"I liked Zodiac and Snow Crash, and really liked Diamond Age, but this book just didn't keep my interest. I took it back to the library after reading a few dozen pages."
1,For Fans Only,"I couldn't imagine recommending this book to anyone other than a die-hard Stephenson fan. The text is excrutiatingly oblique. I read many paragraphs over and over trying to discern the plot points, to no avail. The story has no real beginning, middle, or end and just meanders between clever moments.That's the real key to understanding this book -- the word ""clever."" Stephenson is certainly clever, and that represents the only redeeming quality of QuickSilver. While burning through 900 pages of pointless little episodes I often smiled at the phrasing, geek-insider jokes, etymological asides, and other little nuggets to keep me going. But to the non-fan these will be too few and far inbetween to make up for the lack of plot or charachters."
3,Someday I'll finish,"Neal Stephenson is one of my favorite authors. I have read every one of his books (some twice). However, his latest series of books that starts with this book is one that I have not been able to get into. I have started the book 3 different times and have not been able to get into it enough to finish. Someday I will, but for some reason its not grabbing my attention like his other books have done."
2,Self indulgence on a grand scale,"This book is self indulgence on a grand scale, Neal Stephenson building on the success of _Cryptonomicon_ (a vast, sprawling, doorstop of a book that was astoundingly good) in order to create a self-indulgent mess of a book that sprawls everywhere and goes nowhere. To say that I was, and am, disappointed is an understatement. The Neal Stephenson of _The Diamond Age_ or _Snow Crash_ appears to have disappeared. This book has the worst of _Cryptonomicon_ (the sprawling doorstop of a book nature) without that thing that Crytonomicon had in spades, actual PLOT.Buy only if you're a Stephenson completist. There's lots of better ways to spend your time. This book is better than the bodice rippers out there (thus I give it 2 stars), but otherwise is not worth going out of your way to read, even if you like historical fiction."
1,Lots of potential but huge disappointment,"I am a huge fan of all the previous Stephenson books I have read (Zodiac, Snow Crash, Cryptonomicon). What makes his books so great are that they are extremenly well-researched and deal with complex subjects in an entertaining way. He also has a great sense of humor. But Quicksilver is lacking the same humor that runs through his previous books--I didn't laugh at all throughout the 900+ pages. And the characters are much more one-dimensional than in his other books, you really don't care what happens to anyone.There is also no plot--while Cryptonomicon was a real page turner, I just wanted to get Quicksilver over with... like a doctor's appointment. For someone who wants to learn a lot about 17th century Europe, this book will serve you quite well. But if you want an entertaining story with an exciting plot or good character development, this book falls flat. I am not anxiously awaiting his next book The COnfusion."
1,Not worth buying,"I've read and loved all of Neal Stephenson's prior novels, appreciating his storytelling, his ability to visualize the future and craft fascinating extrapolations of where technology might take us. Even Zodiac, although not SF, was excellent.So be warned that Quicksilver is NOT the same sort of book. I found it to be a lame attempt to weave historical scientific figures into a fictional story. After 200 pages of trying to slog my way through, I'm giving up and moving on to other books by other authors. The story was too slow, too boring and just not worth my time. Go read William Gibson's ""Pattern Recognition"" or Neil Gaiman's ""Neverwhere"" instead."
2,I guess that I just don't get it...,"After reading the reviews here, maybe I would like Cryptonomicon better? I am having a hard time finishing this book. I have no idea where it is going at this point, and worse - I don't care. I'm reading other books while Quicksilver sits face down, open and spine-bent in place in the optimistic hope that I will return to it when I finish all my other unread books. But it will have to wait for now."
1,Say what?,"I can't pick it up. I try and I try, but I cannot finish this book. I keep getting drawn away from it and have read three other titles while that one sits there taunting me. I just do not find it interesting at all."
5,Such a sweet story!,"This book was unexpectedly adorable! I was hooked on the first page, when Little Porcupine gave his mama a ""big, pinchy hug."" The other animals ridicule him for being a ""stick ball"" and won't let him have a part in the ""Baby in the Manger"" play, but his mother calls him ""the light of my life."" He gets his chance to be the star of the play when the animals forget to put up a Christmas star. I love this book! It actually choked me up a bit at the end! We will be reading this one every year at Christmastime."
3,Entertaining read,"The publisher Authorhouse is a self publisher, print on demand company. Not that this necessarily speaks to the quality of the writing. ""Earth is Ours"" however is a simple book, written in a colloquial and juvenile style, with some errors. Here are a few example excerpts:""His skills impressed even him. Levi could run faster than his horses, which surprised both him and the horses.""In a way, this works, I can see a horse galloping at 40mph thinking ""wtf?"" as a 6' 5"" man sprints past him.""They were approaching the lake and she wanted Levi to maintain a wide birth around the area.""'birth' (vs 'berth') is the sort of word that would be not flagged by a spell checker but would by one's publishing editor. A wide 'birth' is a hole [sic] other thing :)Imagine Keanu Reeve trying to recite an Arthur C. Clarke novel from memory.But I give this book 3 stars because it was entertaining. It's fun to read and I genuinely enjoyed it."
5,Amazing,This book is amazing. It was so easy to fall in love with the characters and I was unable to put this book down as it seemed that I was there as the battle was raging. Gary Babb put great detail into this book. His ability to switch from the male perspective to the female perspective was interesting as well. Looking forward to reading Target Earth!!
5,really good,i originally bought the cd because tuck was on it. the texas tycoonz def held their own. i would recomend people pick this up and i am gonna look for more from both these artists.
4,works o.k. it needs some practice,Using this device is just like training a dog. It did have troubles detecting 2.4G signal for the first 2-3 days (it did not pick up signal everytime computer reboots at the beginning.) But as time goes on it works perfectly fine without a problem. i am using it on P4-winXP machine. I recommend this model.
5,Surprisingly entertaining,"I bought this book on a whim after reading a review of it in a magazine at the hair salon. The idea of a book about a woman who can talk to her dog intrigued me.I ended up having to special order it from my local bookstore, but it was definately worth the wait. Got it just in time for a Holiday road trip.It's a fast read, but very entertaining. You will most definately laugh out loud at this one. The dogs are hillarious. I love the how they talk like us, where in most books it's usually very preschoolish language, these dogs have a fabulous vocabulary making it all the more entertaining.I will warn you, there's a lot of cursing so if you're not a fan of that kind of language keep that in mind.I love Dawn's crazy family and her tragic romances.If you're a fan of dogs or animals in general you most definately have to get this book!"
1,No fun,"I was intrigued by the premise of this book and thought it might be a quick, fun read. Unfortunately, this book is not worth reading. The characters are whiny and don't have any redeeming qualities. The dogs talking thing was too cutesy and cliche and doesn't make up for the lack of a plot.Markoe also inserted bits where the narrator talks about the book itself as it's being told in retrospect. Sometimes self-aware storytellers can pull off things like that, but it just didn't work. I think some better editing would've helped.I am an animal lover, but the talking dog quirk was not enough to make me enjoy this book. If you're a person who has dogs and really feels like they're part of the family (and doesn't care too much about the rest of the story) you might enjoy this as a beach read. Otherwise, don't bother."
4,"super cute story, uber dysfunctional family unit!","This was a cute book. Dawn's life is a mess. She is always picking the wrong men, but she trys to do better. She adopts a abandoned dog and keeps him for a number of years before he passes away.She adopts a half pit shepherd mix from the pound, and completely falls in love.When her creepy boyfriend leaves her for another (job) Girlfriend whatever, she is heartbroken and turns to her dog Chuck. Only this time Chuck talks to her. Dawn is shocked and through several very funny chapters, she learns about loyality, love and fun through the dogs eyes.She also finds out who is a good life partner. ""Never pick anyone who does not like puppies.""says Chuck.A very cute intertaining read."
4,Dog Lovers delight!,"A dog lovers delight! I couldn't stop laughing at Chuck's view of the Dating seen and life in general. If you love dogs, you can picture them saying everything Chuck does. You find yourself cheering when the heroine finally finds happiness."
2,Shoulda got it from the library,Being an animal lover I was certain I would love this book. But what a disappointment it was. Disfunctional family misseries is about all it was. With a tiny bit of dog-story-cuteness.
1,too much profanity,"I figured this would be a cute read, had a friend who seems conservative, but it turned out that the profanity was like a conversation is with a bunch of construction workers,,,used in every other sentence or more. It was not even being used as an emphasis or infliction, just conversational. The story line was more for that of an older teen that is still forming their place in the world that is not bothered by the language. My opinion as an adult with a stable life found it to be ignorant and offensive."
4,"Laughed out Loud, Must read for dog lovers","I loved this light read. It was fun, made me laugh, and I identified with the thoughts and habits of the main character. Made me feel more normal for how I think about my dogs! =)"
2,Good Imagination,"Totally goofy story, but I enjoyed it because I am an animal lover, especially of dogs. Just very easy read. Loaned it to a dog lover friend of mine and she didn't like it at all."
1,Boring and waste of money,"The writing was OK (not great but not awful) UNTIL the dogs started talking. It was done in such a stereotypical, bad movie kind of way - incredibly unimaginative and stupid. If I didn't pay for the book, I would have stopped reading about a quarter of the way into it. It stunk!"
2,Cute idea... bad execution,"I really am at a loss for words. The book's back cover made it sound so entertaining, but I'm having trouble staying awake to read it! The idea is great... It really is. But the book overall is tedious and boring. I'm really disappointed."
2,I wanted to like it...,"I love dogs and dog books. I am also a fan of chicklit with lovable loser protagonists. I enjoyed this book (despite the weak narrative) until the dogs started to talk. We all know that dogs are obsessed with smells and base bodily needs, but is that all they would talk about if they could? I prefer to think not. In my fantasy world dogs would articulate their undying love and loyalty, reinforcing the qualities I find endearing. Want a great dog story? Try Caroline Knapp's ""Pack of Two."" Brilliant!"
3,Girlfriend needs a major dose of self esteem,"Good points:1. I loved the animal roles in this book, except for Chuck's exceedingly foul language. She could've toned it down and we'd still get the point, but even that I can forgive -- no one has 'heard' him until now --2. The characters were very colorful. I could picture her nutty sister with every frenetic move she made.Egads:1. Geesh, I cannot get past the protagonist's lack of willingness to stand up for herself or consider herself worthy. No one takes that much abuse from her own family, do they??? And horrible Paxton; ugh, I could not tolerate him for one minute. Her inability to see through his selfishness was so frustrating I would have stopped reading were it not for wanting to be sure Chuck (and Brandi and the others!) were OK.2. See #1 above."
3,seems contrived,"here's the thing- a lot of what the dogs say are things a dog would never say. they use terms and expressions many people don't even use, and they speak of things dogs would have no way of knowing anything about. like caviar. i don't even know what caviar is like, but this pound puppy of the protagonist's does. i know it's fiction, but it could have been done better. i can buy into a book about talking dogs, but i would have enjoyed it if the talking more realistically depicted the things dogs might say. i am about 2/3 done w/ this book and not really sure i care to finish it."
4,"A bright, witty read from one of the best","Ms. Markoe's one of my favorite essayists, and she's equally apt at skewering the easy targets of Southern California in fiction. Part-way through, she takes a brave step and tries a literary device few can pull off -- but it works!As a syndicated pet-care columnist, though, I can't help but to point out that some of the things the dogs experience in the novel show Markoe's a dog-lover, but no dog expert. For one thing, ""yearly shots"" haven't been good veterinary practice for years now. (Sorry for the nit-pick, but it's important not to keep these outdating ideas roaming about.)Aside from that ... I really enjoyed the read. Looking forward to more from this talented, imaginative and very funny writer."
3,Walking in Circles Before Lying Down,Found it had some very humorous points but all in all it dragged out too long.
3,Not My Cup of Tea,"Markoe's book was well written, but I found the character's more annoying than funny. Also the depiction of what the dog's were thinking felt flat. This, I believe, had nothing to do with the quality of the writing as much as it wasn't my cup of tea. The story apparently resonated better with other readers. Who knows...maybe I was just in a foul mood when I began this book. Give Markoe's story a shot if you've got some time to kill. It's a pretty fast read."
3,"Good start, bad middle and end","I had high hopes for this book. It started off well. Great, witty comments about the main character's crazy family, and the writing style was something that was a step-up from chick lit. It was razor sharp and I was really into it for about 50 pages.And then the dog started to talk, and it was all downhill from there. I was so excited about Chuck at first, but he became very one-dimensional, unappealing and boring, and dogs are not boring! He became obsessed with sex and food, and how original is it that a dog likes sex and food? And the other dog's characters were just as lame. The dog Brandy says, ""dude"" all the time, which made me cringe. The dog's characters were just poorly thought-out and lazy, and I was truly disappointed.Overall, the book was well-written, but the author has a ways to go before she's a thought-provoking writer. Or even a funny one."
3,"Decent, but could have been better","The book gets off to a slow start, but if you are willing to plow your way through it, it does become enjoyable later on. Toward the end it could even be considered a page turner. There are many parts that are flawlessly written and are very enjoyable to read. That being said, much of the prose feels forced, and some of the things that come out of the dog's mouth are completely unbelievable. The insertion of tips from an internet writing course only serves to distract the reader and bog down the pace of the book, the book would have been much better off without them. Ms. Markoe is a promising writer, but the reader cannot help but notice the mismatch between the forced prose and the sections that flow seamlessly."
2,"Oh, so so of a read.","I purchased the book after hearing an interview with the author and was anticipating a very funny novel about the main character and her conversations with dogs. Yes, there was that, and it was funny, but there was not nearly enough! The rest of the novel was about her failure in matters of the heart and her very strange disfunctional family. I was disappointed."
5,One of the funniest books I've ever read,This is one of the funniest books I've ever read! I was literally laughing out loud more times than I could count. The dog dialogue is perfect; I could easily imagine dogs saying exactly these things. The way the author presents the heroine's dysfunctional friends-and-family was great satire and the writing style was breezy and immediate. Lots of fun!
4,The Dog Caught My Ear,"I didn't know what to expect from this book, but when I read about the talking dog, I had to get it. The book was different from any I've read before. If getting a peek behind the Hollywood scene and getting a truer profile of what certain celebrities may be like, you will find this book quite interesting. If you enjoy good humor, an honest approach to the human condition, with its foibles and triumphs, this book will draw you in with the ups and downs of life and how it can be handled. With a number of richly fleshed out characters, this book will entertain. For any person who lives with a dog, talks to the dog and believes it is more than a one-way conversation or a one-way interaction--you will love Chuck! I ordered another book by this author, so pleased was I with how Chuck was given a pivotal role in this story. I can't wait to read--""Nose Down, Eyes Up."""
5,A must for dog lovers,If you have ever thought you could read your dogs mind this book is a must. Very cute and inventive.
3,Humorous Losers,"I didn't feel good, I didn't feel bad, I felt nothing after finishing this book. I find it impossible to identify with Markoe's characters and they're not endearing enough to feel sympathy for them. Perhaps she should have edited her ""talking dog"" novels into a collection of short stories. That way readers might be spared the sordid details. Not worth my time, perhaps it's worth yours."
4,If you're a dog lover...,"Loved it, loved it, loved it. A funny story about a dysfunctional family, what could be better? I'll tell you - add talking dogs. The concept isn't new (Mr Ed, anyone? Wilfred? Look Who's Talking 3?) but Merrill Markoe made it laughing-out-loud funny. I kept quoting bits of it to my family (who only looked mystified - guess you gotta read it). Thoroughly enjoyed the book, the characters, the dogs. Will be reading more by this author.Do yourself a favor. Read it for FUN."
2,It's OK,"This novel has a nice, simple prose making it very readable. However, I found it to be lacking power, emotion, and great excitement. Their were some lines where I laughed aloud, but other than the occasional laugh, this book did nothing for me. I found the characters to be weak and the story-line predictable. The only strong characters are the dogs, and they speak surprisingly little."
2,Terribly Disappointing,"As a dog lover, I was so looking forward to reading this book. The premise of the character's dogs talking to her and giving relationship advice sounded funny.What a huge disappointment this book was. The first 60 pages are so poorly written and uninteresting, I didn't see a point. The characters are boring. There was no ""dog talking"" to that point. After the first 60, then she starts to hear her dogs ""talk"". In actuality, she hears in her mind, not out loud, the dogs voices. I found it rather offensive that all the dogs seemed to have such foul mouths. Even if dogs could talk, I don't think they would be saying F-you to us or anyone else. The conversations were so ridiculously far fetched, that I lost interest. I finally gave up more than half way through the book.Had this story been written by a better author, this could have been a great book."
1,"Awful, Simply Awful","What I thought would be a cute book about relationships and dogs was instead a trainwreck. The beginning tries your sympathies at a disfunctional family - read ""The Glass Castle"" for a really disfunctional childhood. Then we are to feel sorry for someone who could have gone to college, but chose not to, so she is living in a trailer with her crazy sister. Not really understanding how she got married twice to the wrong men and stayed for years. I was endeared by her love of dogs and their love for her, until her dogs start speaking to her. But not in a cute funny way. In a way that makes me think she needs to be admitted. Towards the end, she goes back to her loser boyfriend and then the kicker...she's not 27 and a loser, but 37. Nearing the age myself, this was NOT funny or uplifting or anything but sad. Simply AWFUL!"
1,Had to stop half way through,"I stop at chapter 9,(do to bordom) I went online to check the reviews of this book...just to see if was worth continue!...I had the same negative feeling as other reviewers. This dosnt seem to be my cup of tea either, Maybe its me or the writer, but it dosnt seem to keep my interest.From a Miley and Me Fan!"
4,"Good, but don't forget the influences...","Ok, so maybe it's great. It's well produced and well made, with some nice groovy chops in there. I hear a lot of Autechre/Richard James, so I don't exactly find it to be years ahead of anything, nor completely original. The more standard timing of the tracks makes it more ""groove-able"" than some of their more mixed tracks. Overall, a great album, it just erks me when I hear how ahead of its time it is, when the style was heard 15 years ago. Don't get me wrong, buy this album because it is a very very good listen, and you will not be disappointed."
1,never even turned on.,I bought this model and out of the box it never even turned on. I did some research and it seems that this is not uncommon for this model. Too bad I was looking forward to that great media center. Good bye Western Digital!Hello Seagate!
5,Great product,"I have this one for about a year and i have no problems. It works great and the memory card reader rocks. I dunno why people said it stop works or lose information, maybe they have the hardisk always turned on, i use the harddrive and then i shut off the power when im not using it."
2,Returned after a 30-second try out,"The only thing misleading about the product description on this item is ""support."" I would never have thought it would be so difficult to find a support pillow with some substance to it. I've been looking for more than a year to find a pillow roll that will actually keep my head from sinking into an overpriced cloud of thin air. Too SOFT!"
2,"Not as firm, provides little support","The pillow can be used in the four positions as the description mentions, but it is just not firm enough to provide support. The only case in which I though it provided any help as placing it below the knee, or between the knees while sleeping."
2,lilmisstude,"I found the product to be a waste of time. It was uncomfortable to use and it was supposed to move with you when you slept which it never did,however Amazon quickly reimbursed me.I've used Amazon for a couple of years now and I have been very pleased with their service.I read the reviews before buying and some people were complaining they couldn't do a return because the item had been open or used,I think the problem was with them not with the company."
3,"Good product, but for our purposes, not perfect","This is an excellent product, but not for us. Our purpose was for a slight head prop on a lazy boy. We think because we're not horizontal, there isn't enough weight to make an impression in the pillow, thus, it's slightly too thick for our needs."
2,Too soft,This pillow would be perfect if it were firmer. While sleeping on my side with it between my knees it slowly collapses down and soon it doesn't give enough support to prevent back pain.
3,Not so pillowy.,"The pillow is very hard and does not really give. I had hoped to use it under my knees while sleeping, but it is not high enough. It is too hard to use between the legs while sleeping, and it is not comfortable for my head. It does make a great lumbar support though."
3,Comfort comes in unusual forms,"Great pillow for a nap or lie-down when your hair is already styled or is in curlers. Provides comfortable yet firm neck support when you sleep on your back and above average neck support when you sleep on your side. Haven't tried it for knee support or back support, yet. It's also small enough for children's slumber parties and campouts."
1,not enough support,"I got this pillow to support my knee post knee surgery, but it doesn't provide enough support. The foam is very squishy, and in a matter of minutes, the pillow was flat and my knee aching. It popped right back into shape, but just doesn't provide enough support for me."
1,Not much support,The cushion is very soft so doesn't provide good lumbar support and if you put it under your knees when lying down you can hardly tell it's there.
2,Not firm enough,"I ordered this pillow to provide back support for my lower back. This pillow is far too soft to provide any support for the lower back. The only thing it might be supportive enough for is the neck (as a pillow for lying down). I even tried it for supporting my knees while lying down, but it was too soft for that, too. I'm sorry I ordered this instead of the McKenzie firm pillow from the beginning. I had to go for an extra week without proper support for my back."
1,Really too small for comfort,"This product was fairly priced when it was at $10. Now its at $15, but the main thing is that its very small. It just fits my back and its not soft at all. It feels stiff and it just serves as a hard cushion between your back and the seat.Overall, i dont think this support pillow helped at all. At best, it can be used as a cushion. Its really too small to be a back support.I recommend you guys, DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM! Instead, opt for the Opus Forme lower back support. I bought it and its great!"
2,"EXTRA, EXTRA Firm Recovery","I bought this product as a gift for my sexagenarian mother who recently had knee surgery. Since she is a side sleeper, I thought the Ortho Therapy Pillow could be used between her knees for support. My mom was excited to open the gift but soon disappointed to discover that she would have to wait for her knee to heal before she could use it, if ever. That pillow is hard as a rock! Someone is going to have to soften it by literally sitting on it or weighting it down. I would also not recommend using it under your neck, unless you want a serious strain and an emergency visit to the chiropractor. Maybe you could use it while sitting for lower back support, but I would sooner recommend a rolled-up towel than this hard monstrosity. The only position out of four that I would suggest this pillow be used for is to elevate your legs while at rest. I sincerely thought, with a name like HoMedics, it would be useful in my mother's recovery. Guess not."
5,A bargain at any price,"I own several of these pillows and absolutely adore them. I have chronic back pain as a rule, and not only have these pillows helped me immensely for getting better sleep, but now that I am pregnant as well, they've proven every bit as useful for using instead of expensive and bulky pregnancy pillows. You can use these singly or in groups to really customize your support and comfort where you most need it. These are an eminently portable size, so I also keep one in the car to lean my head on during long family car trips. My only complaint about them is that you can't buy spare or replacement pillowcases for them, but the pillowcase that comes with it machine washes nicely and holds up pretty well. The foam is a comfy firmness-- not rock-hard and not insubstantial-- so it will work well in any number of applications. LOVE this product and would highly recommend-- a bargain at any price!"
5,I love this pillow,I was experiencing neck pain with every pillow in my house until I bought this one. I even have other expensive temperpedic pillows. For me it is the shape of the pillow which might not be right for every one.
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this pillow. Based on the other reviews, I thought it would be great. But they fail to mention that this pillow flattens significantly for all use, so it does not provide the support I wanted. I placed the pillow under my knees and it did not keep its shape. I also used it as a leg separator (for side sleeping) and same thing-no support. If you want a minimal support pillow, this would work. I did purchase the leg separator by the same manufacturer and that was more supportive and did not flatten."
1,no cushion in this support pillow,"This pillow falls flat- literally. I ordered it as a companion to another pillow I have - the Carex semi roll. That one is far superior to this one. When you lean on it, it falls flat like a pancake. It's getting returned..."
3,Good but not as a knee pillow,"Good for cervical and lumbar support, but squishes too much for a knee pillow. (which is my primary use so I'm not that happy with this item.)"
3,Good but not perfect,"I have a physical disability and I invest in multiple types of orthopedic cushions. This particular pillow helps provide some comfort for my neck (although I purchased it for my low back or to use under my knees while sitting - which it does not help with). The cushion could be more supportive. If you need neck support, this is for you. If you want a versatile cushion for various body parts, this is not the cushion to buy."
2,disappointed,I bought this pillow for under my legs so that I could sleep on my back and it is to soft. The pillow squishes down and gives no support for legs it did work ok under my head.
3,Gentle (not firm) support,"If you're looking for a firm, supportive bolster, then this is not the pillow for you. If you just need a gentle lift, then it'll do the trick -- and at a great price. I place this one under or between my knees for lower back support during sleep. The softness makes it easier to switch positions during the night."
4,HoMedics Pillow,I got this pillow to put under or between my knees for better back support. It does help when used properly.
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I really wish the product description had been clearer about the dimensions of this 4 position cushion. It says 18"" x 8"" x 4"" and I mistakenly thought the 8 was the height not the width and I was looking for something a bit higher. I need something under my knees to ease my back & leg pain while laying down and this isn't high enough to offer much help. Since the cover's a bit loose I unzipped it and put some fiberfill to make it a couple inches higher but it's still not what I expected. The writer of this description should have been more specific and listed the measurements like this: 18""L x 8""W x 4"" H. It would have saved me some money because I'd have bought something else."
3,Okay... would have liked it to be more firm,Like many I'm on the constant search for the right pillow or combination of pillows.When Reading in bed I was hoping this would provide under the knee support-- It does to a limited degree but is not firm enough to really support the knee area.For side sleeping it is not firm enough for between the legs.In the right position it is okay for behind the neck.I sometimes place it directly on the bed and while side sleeping place a knee on it. For this it again works okay but i would have liked it to be firmer.The actual size is nice not overly large or bulky but not too small either.
3,Not long enough to be useful,"The pillow is useful only if you're not going to move around too much while using it (i.e. when you're awake). Otherwise, it's not long enough to stay in its place. It needs to be heavier and/or longer."
3,Okay,Its not as comfy as I thought it was. It is not firm enough to use as a leg pillow and just isn't comfortable as a lower back pillow or head pillow. Maybe I'll start using it as a lower back pillow for a chair.
3,"comfy, but more like 2-position","this was a little bit of a pricey experiment. the pillow is great for under the knee but it is a little too steep for under the neck and moves around too much for behind the back. forget about between the knees, its a bit insubstantial. but if you need a knee pillow its great."
4,Good for neck support,"I purchased this pillow to use as neck support when sitting on the couch, and it has worked out great. My only wish is that it would be a bit firmer, as I feel like the foam ""compresses"" a bit too much, making it softer than I'd like. That's just a personal preference, though, so don't let that stop you; it's a good product that performs as described."
3,The right shape,Good pillow but not as firm as I would like. It loses its shape. Wish there was a guide line so you would know before buying.
4,Love the Ortho Therapy 4 position pillow!,"I'm a therapist and also have disk problems in my own neck. Using this in place of a regular pillow allows my head and neck to be in a more normal position during sleep, regardless of position. I buy this pillow for my patients and clients. I only wish the foam was a tad bit softer, as it is a little stiff in a cold room during winter."
4,No asteroids!!!!!,"Since I use the asteroids, I was disappointed that they left them out this year and, also, printed only very small ephemeris pages (four months to a page). Other than that, they have added advice to the listing of aspects for each day, which should be interesting to follow, day by day."
5,Brain treats,"If from time to time, you yearn for chocolate, you can understand the delights of this book. The book is a splendid mixture of science and fact mixed with humor and insights. One of the best ways to spice up life is to keep asking questions...the more weird the question, the more interesting the answers. The authors of this book are truly advocates of the ""weird and wonderful"", and I do hope they keep on asking so that I keep on learning. A real ""thumbs-up "" book that is fun to read!"
3,Intresting facts,"the book contained interesting facts. The book contained notes that were written between the two writters there were ment to be funny, which was rather stupid... but the facts were interesting. If you like strange facts, you will probably enjoy this book."
4,Chi Hts back then,Chicago Heights very interesting. Good photos of the old city. Liked remarks about what could be seen in the background as one might have missed it otherwise.
3,"Helpful, Thoughtful, but Her Web Page Gives Me Doubts...","I like Karla's presentation and she has some great ideas that really help. Others seems so complicated. But perhaps necessary for those of us who are hypersensitive.My only concern was when I went to her web site and found that she had ""called a halt to her metaphysical/spiritual career"" and was studying sociology and behavioral sciences so she can do solid research on the metaphysical work she's been doing. She still has faith in metaphysical healing, but she wants to combine it with what is standardly accepted...? Don't trust my summary - read her announcements at EMOVERE.COM.I'm just wondering what the outcome will be...."
1,Buy her tape instead,"Her tape, ""Healing for Healers: How to Give Without Giving it All Away"" is also available through Amazon. In my opinion it has all the best ideas from the CD at less than a quarter of the price."
5,"Useful, inspiring and supportive","As a sensitive person strongly affected by other people my whole life, this was yet another confirmation of the ignored obvious: that we are all far more complex than we are given credit for and can be damaged when part of us we don't own continue to affect us and others in a variety of ways. Other great resources include the The Highly Sensitive Person and energy books by Barbara Ann Brannan."
3,"Not bad, not Great...","I bought this CD after I heard just one song at a friend's house. It isn't bad at all, but I was expecting a little more 'depth' and 'world influence' and a little less tin can background. If I had a chance, I probably would not buy it again."
5,4th Set - Excellent Product,"I've put these VentShade deflectors on 4 different vehicles now, trucks and cars. Each time, the fit is perfect, they adhere like they are bolted on and really work nicely to allow an open window even when it is raining. I had a set on my F150 for six years and when I sold the truck, they were still like new. I highly recommend this product."
2,Una novela sin color,"Cuesta mucho trabajo avanzar en la lectura de este libro, aunque ese no es el mal peor. Hay libros de trama lenta que, sin embargo, se disfrutan por su prosa exquisita. No es √©ste el caso. A la lenta narrativa se une un estilo pretencioso, de alguien que intenta ""hacer literatura"", pero que fracasa estrepitosamemte. Por otra parte, es una historia que no se cree. No hay coherencia en la psicolog√≠a de los personajes. Todo parece escrito desde afuera, pese a que en la portada se anuncia que la autora recrea la vida de su abuelo chino y que la propia autora aparece con una foto en la que est√° disfrazada de china, con maquillaje en los ojos para hacerla parecer asi√°tica. El libro, como la foto, dan la impresi√≥n de una impostura falsificada para un marketing de ventas."
3,"Great reference tool, less valuable as a monograph","One has to be truly dedicated to - or at least well versed in - macrobiotics and nutrition to enjoy this book as something to read. Unlike my favorites - Laurel's Kitchen, and the works of Deborah Madison - it is densely written with tables and percentages of obscure nutrients. Nevertheless, as a reference tool it is a gem."
5,I Couldn't Put it Down!!,"Okay, I hardly EVER buy books that have multiple stories in them, but had heard that this one was very good. I was not disappointed. It is four stories about four women, Miriam is the first heroine, Rebekah is the second (she's in a wheelchair), Laura is the third and Rachel is the main character in the fourth.What I liked so much about each of these stories, was, not only were they engaging and interesting, but I learned a lot about the Amish and their way of life. I'd recommend this book highly to anyone who enjoys these kinds of stories."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY -- better off buying a regular cooler,"Boy does this product SUCK!!Totaly did NOT live up to my expectations at all. The soda and water I wanted to use it for never got cold enough, always tasted like room tempature. And, when it is real hot out, you would think that this ""fridge"" would deliver a cold refreshing drink, but all I got was a warm disapointment -- the drinks actually come out WARMER when it's hot weather.No wonder the previous owner was selling it on Amazon. I don't even have the guts to resell this product, I'm even embarrased just reviewing it."
3,not bad,"Overall, I am happy with this device. I have a number of cameras that all use different size memory cards. So this is very helpful. However, the thing that I really don't like is the distance between the usb and the device! There's less than 2 inches space which makes it a bit of a hassle to use."
2,Streetcar Days in Honolulu - Trolley Buff's Beware,"The most important parts of a trolley company history is the dates of opening of lines; the arrangement of services and a roster of the equipment operated. In this volume, one has to search hard for line opening dates, service realignments are merely mentioned and not detailed; and despite pull out boxes on various groups of cars, the information is quite lacking; just try to trace information of the 1-25 series from purchase to retirement. Where the retired trailers used in their rebuilding? What of the second 12 which was a homebuilt car? Were other vehicles rebuilt like 57? The hand tinted postcards are are unique and well thought out way of illustrating this volume, but a roster is sorely missing."
4,Liked it,"This book does give some keen insights into sports parenting, especially where it talks about travel teams and your child's chances for for a sports scholarship.If you are familiar with Rick Wolff's work (Coaching Kids for Dummies, or some of his magazine articles), this book also covers the some of the same topics. These include the PGA (post-game analysis), dealing with your child's coach, and avoiding pushing your kid too much."
1,full of regret,"I thought this was so cute but as time has gone by (3 weeks) I have come to realize this is cute to look at but completely useless. It doesn't work, it will stall after a couple of minutes and so I'll shake it and it starts working again for a minute and then breaks down again. I've thrown it away and am looking at some new options."
2,disappointed,"The egg timer is difficult to set. You have to turn it 360 degrees in one direction and then to your desired time in the other direction. I can never remember if it is supposed to be clockwise first or counterclockwise first. Also, it quits working frequently. I can hear it ticking and think that it is keeping time. Then notice later it stopped keeping track of time and never Rings when it should. We have a toddler so it might have been dropped too many times. Not a very durable product."
5,Good timer and works perfectly,"My kid has 20 minutes/everyday reading assignment, and I bought this timer to track time. It works perfectly and my kid likes the timer."
1,totally not worth buying,"Absolutely avoid buying this item! After winding it up and waiting for alarm to go off, it never did it. Tried multiple times. Alarm only fires if you manually turn the egg to the 0'' mark position. I have read the negative reviews here about this item, but, I guess I have learned about it the hard way, after all."
1,waste of money,This little guy may be cute- but he didn't last a whole day in our house. He was going to be used to help manage bed-time routine. The 3 y/o turned him once or twice and that was it- no more egg timer.
1,a piece of junk,AVOID! Received the timer last Thursday and tried it few times. The timer simply stops after time is up and the alarm NEVER fires. The measured time was EXTREMELY imprecise as well.
3,"Cute, but...","This little timer is very cute. But since the purpose that I bought the timer for was to get the exact minute/second, I was disappointed. As other reviewers indicated, it's very hard to tell exactly where the setting is and you'd certainly not be able to set this for half minutes (2.5 minutes). If you want to set it for 3 minutes and don't care if it's off +- 20 seconds, than I would say you'd be happy with this. We now use it at my house to indicate how long the kids will clean up or for time outs and it's fine for that. I have a more exact timer in the kitchen."
1,Syriana? Babel?,"If you liked 'Syriana' or 'Babel' for the so-called entertainment they were, you'd probably like this too. I didn't like either fo them, so after about an hour of misery, gratuitous violence and a plot that would be going nowehere if it actually existed to some extent, I pressed on 'eject' and went to bed. I've had enough of trash like this, so I know when to pull the plug. I think new categories should be required for movie distribution so we know what we're getting and we can save our time and money from the outset."
1,A bad film,I agree with the reviewers who did not like this film. I disliked it so much that I quit watching it after about a half hour.
2,2 stars - 1 for Bruce Davison & 1 for Joe Morton,"What a load of rubbish. The only redeeming features for me were Bruce Davision and Joe Morton but why they chose this crap to be in, well, only they know. They are worthy of better - much, much better.This sorry excuse for a movie should have been killed off before it began, who funds rubbish like this anyway, it's diabolical.I had to laugh at the end when the dedication: 'To the City and People of Tijuana - with Love and Respect' - really?, I should think it should have been 'To the City and People of Tijuana, with our heartfelt apologies for making your city and people look like the last place on earth you'd want to be' In short, this movie sucks - big time."
5,Delightful and charming,"Isra the Butterfly is a delightful and charming book for children ages four toeight. Isra is young, but wants to play with her older sisters and wants toleave Butterfly Land so that she can venture out into the outside world.Warned by her mother and under the supervision of her sisters, she's stillconvinced that she can move her wings quickly enough to escape any danger.Unfortunately, she's not as quick as she believes and is caught and taken toShow and Tell.Young-Robinson has given us a careful blend of adventure for the children aswell as lessons on obeying parents. I loved this book and would definitelyrecommend it to others. Finley's illustrations are an added bonus to this bookand beautifully portray Isra, her family, and the children in the outside world.Reviewed by Tee C. Royalof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
4,Charming,This is one of the most charming children's books I've read in ages. I bought one copy for my neice and another for my god-daughter. The author is really gifted.
5,Children Will Appreciate Literature!,Isra the Butterfly Gets Caught for Show and Tell is a entertaining story with a very valuable lesson for children. It teaches children to obey their parents and heed their warnings as was Isras' lesson as well as teaching children from the outside world like Miya to be kind to animals and appreciate nature. A quality book that should be a part of every child's collection.
5,Isra the Butterfly Gets Caught For Show And Tell,"Thank you for letting our class read your first childrens book. We really enjoyed looking at the big colorful pictures and we were able to read all of the words. The book was fun. We liked the hard cover on it also. We were able to identify the setting, conflict and the solution. We also like the fact that the author wrote the book on our level yet second through fourth graders can read it and still enjoy it. Isra The butterfly speads her wings on Show and Tell Day. Isra the Buterfly is the baby or her family. Butterfly Land is such a beautiful place but the outside world is so different. The imagination the author brings to this story is awsome! We are looking forward to reading the next book. Good Luck!"
1,I AM FURIOUS,"I bought this book because of the simulated testing and when I loaded it, I was NOT ABLE TO SEE THE ANSWERS TO MAKE A SELECTION...THIS BOOK AND CD ARE TOTALLY USELSS AND WERE A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY. I emailed the manufacturer and am waiting to hear back. This is ridiculous...this CD should not be sold if there are software bugs."
1,Look for others,"The review is presented by a brief discussion of a disease and a care plan follows arranged according to priority. A CD also comes with the book. I can say that this disc really simulates the test coz the test stops if it determines your passing. But over all, the book is boring and is ineffective in helping you retain the lessons."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I was disappointed with this book. I feel that the review of disease processes is not helpful. I had hoped to use the CD-ROM, but I could not see the choices for answers. I could not get a refund with the disk already used. I would not buy any Barron's review materials again."
1,nclex-rn,"I would like to get all this books by mail: Carmen Ildiko, Salmiya, P.O.Box.4869, cod.22049 Kuwait. As soon is possible! Please!"
4,Worth a listen.,"Overall this is a worthwhile CD. I have both the CD and the video. The video has Burt giving insight into the songs and artists before each. If you are going to buy just one, get the video. As for the songs, I skip over Mike Meyers, it is really not my style, not funny at all.Sheryl Crow is very good and Bare Naked Ladies. The highlights for me are Dionne and Wynonna. If you don't have chill listening to ""Anyone who had a Heart"", wow, what a song and what a voice..."
3,Creative Compilation,"I appreciate how Burt Bacharach allowed his music to be freely interpreted by a wide variety of artists - Ben Folds Five, Bare Naked Ladies, Wynonna Judd, Luther Vandross to name a few did a wonderful job....I have to question Mike Myers being included to sing ""What's New Pussycat"". I'm sure it was intended to be comedic, but it seems a little rude and out of place. (???) Overall though, an interesting listen-"
5,Buy it for Wynonna alone,"Wonderful CD. Who knew Sheryl Crow could sing like this? As for Wynonna singing ""Anyone Who Had A Heart"" -- she was born to sing this song. It will give you chills."
4,Burt Bacharach's One Amazing Night,"This is a really great album. I love all the songs, but Wynonna's ""anyone who had a heart"" was absolutely breathtaking! She rocks! Mike Myers made me laugh and you should buy it!"
4,Uneven but worth buying,"Initially i had skimmed this CD and was only buying it for Burt Bacharach singing Alfie. but after listening about 4 more songs stood out. the Sheryl Crow song was good.Chrissie Hynde's version of Baby It's You/ Message to Michael was so good on the latter song that when i found the dionne warwick version i was disapointed. Elvis Costello's version of God Give me strength was pretty emotional, more so than another version of the same singer singing the same song somewhere else ive heard. also i like Close to you by barenaked ladies. i generally dislike the band but the vesrion of the song was pretty good."
1,Awful!,"A disappointing, boring, lethargic tribute to a great talent.Half of the voices simply are not up to the task of these great songs."
2,This is not the one to buy,"Burt Bacharach is a wonderful composer whose work I relish. This particular album is not one you need to own. Several of the soloists perform novel but not compelling renditions. While Dionne Warwick may not be the only singer who can make Burt's work fly, several of the artists performing in this production are decidedly uninspiring. Burt probably should not have produced this particular one. Respectfully but honestly, PF"
2,Less than I expected,"My grandsons wanted to know how bees made their hives. This appeared to be the most comprehensive book for young children available, so I ordered it but was disappointed to find that the one thing it did not explain was how beehives are created in the first place! It's an American book (temperature in F,distance in yards, types of honey common only in the US) which I don't believe was mentioned, but doesn't really matter. The cover is the most attractive part of the book which all in all failed to meet my expectations."
1,Elizabeth Thornton wrote this???????????????????????,"If Ms. Thornton actually wrote this rampant nonsense she must have done it when she was 17. The primary characters were both complete nincompoops, the hero was actively unpleasant, the situations were contrived, and the whole book ignored historical accuracy. This is an author who is capable of writing some of the very best in this genre. Because of that I spent $8.99 plus tax for a paperback which went into the garbage less than 1/3rd of the way through. I give it a 0 star rating."
1,Not up to her usual standards,"I've read most of Thornton's books, except for the earliest ones (which I started but didn't like). This one is very much like her early ones with a 'hero' I simply despised. I have no trouble with dark, tormented heroes (or heroines) but this guy was just simply a nasty guy with no redeeming qualities. Couldn't finish the book. That said, I really enjoyed her book before this one -- Shady Lady, and hope she gets back to writing good novels. Given how good most of her books are, she's entitled to a few losers."
4,Essential piece of software,"This is one of the very best things I ever got for my computer. It will partition on the fly, resize, delete as well. It will quick format a large partition as FAT32 (Win2k/XP will only let you format a large drive as NTFS 'cos Microsoft want you move over to that). Copy a partition i.e. make a complete copy of one onto another place on your drive or a 2nd drive if you fit one. Wonderful. It's the only way to resize a partition with an operating system on it, FDISK etc will require you to delete the partition first and lose all the data on it.It's only problem? It can only be installed on a FAT32 partition. If your drive/partition is formatted as NTFS (XP will only format and install on a NTFS partition) you're pretty much stuffed, so it can only be installed on Windows 2000 or earlier, unless you can find some way to convert XP's NTFS to a FAT32 partition, I don't know how to do it hence I can only give it 4 stars. Otherwise, it'd be a 5."
1,Doesn't support WinXP NTFS i-mode attributes,"Just received this after purchasing thru Amazon. Loaded up and tried to convert my Dell P4 4250 with single 120Gb drive/partition to two smaller partitions. Failed 'error 1513' - turns out this is a known failure with WinXP NTFS file systems.Same problem after applying PM 8.01 patch.The workaround from Powerquest is : 'run chkdsk /f', trouble is that doesn't fix it... emailed PQ immediately with all the dump data - no response.So - you decide!, *still* want to part with your cash for this?"
1,Costly Mistake,I bought Partitio Magic 8. I used it on a client's computer. It did not work and corrupted the hard drive. The backup that was created and the data merge did not work.
1,Win Xp BEWARE!,"If using windows xp home or pro with NTFS file system this product may not work. Powerquest has so far been unable to help. I would suggest doing a search for ""partition magic error 1513"" before you buy. I've read other reviews that the software works just fine for XP, but so far just a waste of money.Update, Thanks powerquest. After a week of waiting I was E-mailed the top secrete address to the password protected zip file patch. (oh by the way phone support cost $30.00 per call) The runaround only hurts honest customers how didn't steal there product in the first place. I'm a firm believer that a know problem should be fixed or patch readily available without having to wait on an E-mail reply. After a few files were replaced the software works great, just as expected. You should buy this product a week or so before you intend to use it, just in case. 4 stars for the software 1 for customer support."
3,Follow-up To Error 1513,"PowerQuest now has released a fix for Error 1513, called the ""Error 1513 Patch""...available on its website. After applying the patch I was able to use PartitionMagic to successfully resize a partition.Though the patch works, I still stand by my original assertion that the lack of response by PowerQuest is criminal. Especially given the fact that my email to their support site was within the timeframe of the patch's release; all they had to do was send a reply telling me to check their site in the next week or two."
1,One trashed hard disk later,"For some reason only known to Sony, they ship partitioned hard drives on their Vaio's with C drives hardly big enough for application software, leaving huge expanses of D drives which soon become unusable because of space limitations on the C drive.Hence my reasons for using Partitionmagic.Anyway, if you have XP Media Edition with NTFS and try to use this product, you will probably have your hard drive trashed without warning and will spend a weekend rebuilding your PC from backup data. Trust me on this one, I've been there.This is NOT safe software. If it works, it's great. It just doesn't always work. And product support is really lousy."
1,Ouch! Just lost 120GB of data,"Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!I just lost 120GB of email, personal files, media, and backups.After changing cluster size to 8k to 4k, nothing on drive was readable. No warnings, nothing. There was no way to reverse the process. After holding onto phoneline for almost an hour, PowerQuest support personnel was no help at all.USE THIS SOFTWARE AT YOUR OWN RISK!"
3,Backup your partitions before use!!,"Take the advice to backup your partitions before altering themseriously! I've tried to resize and move partitions onan external 160GB Firewire harddrive and PartitionMagic frozeafter a few minutes. Since it didn't recover, I killed thetask. The partition semmed readeable, but marked as corrupt.So PartitionMagic refused to do anything with it at all, soI had to reformat it.Other times the operations worked fine.The bottom line is: It works, but not reliably, so ALWAYShave a backup of the partitions you're trying to alter."
1,PQ Boot Magic is Terrible,"The partitioning part of PQ Magic 8 seems to work ok.The Boot Magic part is very very very bad.First it did not work at all.Second, I could not load Win2000/Prof as an alternate system. I have Win XP/home. I followed (rather very complicated) instructions carefully.There is no uninstall option, so when I tried to uninstall it,I was left with a bug in the boot process for Win XP(It is easy to get around it, but it occurrs on every bootup).I cannot even reinstall it. It refuses to be reinstalled unless I correct the problem FIRST.Finally, Power Quest is NO help whatsoever. They do NOT reply to my E-mail for help on their support site.If you had a minus 10 rating, I would rate it minus 10."
1,Partition Magic by Power Quest,The disk came in record time but it would not install. I contacted the vendor and he told me to mail it back. Several days after I mailed it back I received a credit to my credit card. It included a credit for postage both ways. Thank you.
1,Nightmare for Win 2000,"It sounds too good to be thru.Due to a lack of ""working space"" on my C: drive PM 8.0 was unable to perform the task of enlarging that partition. The bummer was that it didn't tell me it needed more space, so it started the process only to crash in the middle of it, corrupting the whole drive. Bottom line, I ended up re-formatting the complete drive and spending about 2 full days re-installing all my software/settings etc...I'm not touching this stuff anymore..."
1,Poor support from vendor,"PM works adequately enough for Windows, but your mileage may vary with Linux partitions. For example, in my case, PM pops up warnings re: my Linux partitions, offers to ""fix"" them, but if you let it, PM instead trashes the partition information. As a result, I've had to reinstall Linux twice -- the second time to verify that it was indeed PM's fault. PowerQuest (the vendor) isn't forthcoming when it comes to acknowledging the bug or plans for a fix.Vote with your wallet."
1,Should have read the reviews,"I purchased PartitionMagic 8 last night and installed it on my Gateway laptop running Windows XP. I tried to create a new partition using PartitionMagic. Half way through the process, it displayed a script error and restarted Windows XP. However, now Windows XP immediately shows the Blue Screen. I called Symmantec's Technical Support. They told me the problem was with Windows XP. That I needed to call Microsoft. I replied Windows XP was fine before I started using PartitionMagic. That PartitionMagic did not finish the partitioning part. I also asked if PartitionMagic had a rollback procedure in case something went wrong. The Symantec's Technical Support did not understand my question. The support person did not want to listen. She repeatedly said: ""No, it is a Windows XP problem Sir. You need to call Microsoft.""I WILL NOT USE PARTITION MAGIC OR ANY OF SYMANTEC PRODUCTS. AND I WILL ADVISE MY CLIENTS AND STUDENTS NOT TO DO SO AS WELL."
1,Didn't Work Under XP Home,"I concur with tinmanuk...same error, same attempts to resolve, and same non-response by Powerquest ""support"".I have used PartitionMagic in the past (5.0?) and have sung its praises, but I could not get this version working and the lack of support from the manufacturer is criminal.While some users appear to be able to get it to work with their setups, my money -- and my clients' money -- will be spent on competitors' products."
1,Piece of crud to me,"When you pay this sort of money for a program that does one simple thing, you expect it to work. I've spent hours trying to get it to resize my XP NTFS partition. It keeps erroring out. None of the posted fixes help. I finally ended up just doing things the hard way, wiping the drive and building the partitions from scratch. Don't buy this unless you know for sure that it will work with your specific version of windows on your specific machine - down to the the precise model. If you aren't sure of that, you could end up paying quite a bit of money for an ugly coaster."
1,Won't work if you have Windows XP,"This program gives an error 1513 'Bad attribute position in file record' when used to try to partition a drive under Windows XP. PowerQuest help file says, ""This error can occur in Windows 2000/XP because of a new file record format (called the 'i-node' format) that has been added to Windows 2000/XP. When PowerQuest products detect this new format, they interpret it as an Error 1513."" ...at this point the program quits without creating the wanted partion. End of story. What good is software advertised for XP that won't finish it's job? (PartionMagic 8.0 w/update)"
3,Alright Application,"Like every program, users will run into problems. As much as what some of us would like to think, there is no perfect program. PowerQuest's PartitionMagic 8.0 was a great program, then they came out with the update to it (which is suppose to help) and it screwed my computer up. This program has a great UI; very user-friendly! The biggest problems, excluding the patch, has been the DOS version of this (which is included on the CD) and the fact that is will not run on my 64-bit system. So, unless you're running an Athlon 64-bit processor (or another processor that has 64-bit extensions) this program is great!"
3,"The worst option, except for all the others.","I was stuck with Windows 2000 and Windows XP on my hard drive on the same partition. I wanted to partition my drive so I could install XP on the new partition and delete the old XP installation and 2000 installation from the other partition.When I tried to use Partition Magic to do this, the interface seemed straightforward enough, and I created the new partition with no problem. But I was unable to format the old partition to get rid of the old Windows installations. I'm not sure how it happened, but I ended up totally bollixing up my hard drive. I had to boot from the XP CD-ROM, totally re-format the drive, and re-install XP. This wasn't a major hassle, since the end result was what I wanted, but it was a little disconcerting that the software did not do exactly what I needed it to. All in all, this product is probably the best way to format and partition a hard drive, which is a hairy endeavor under the best of circumstances..."
4,Best for comparative religion studies,"Anyone not raised in a muslim environment will find much Qur'anic material--whether in the ancient Arabic or any modern-language translation--that is extremely objectionable from a moral and/or theological viewpoint; nevertheless, this translation is the very best English translation available for students of comparative religions. Another translation to consider is N.J. Dawood's Penguin Classics edition."
3,"For a truly ""modern english"" translation see",The Holy Koran: An Interpretive Translation from Classical Arabic into Contemporary English (Paperback)by Mohamed K. Jasser (Authoris available here and is a truly readable translation
5,Wonderful,"A beautiful interpretation of the Holy Qur'an in modern English. It captures, both literal and interpretive, the essence of the Qur'an, broadening one's knowledge in the historical and modern context. As a student in Islam, constantly reading the various English translations and transliterations, this one is among the best."
5,Great translation,May God bless the translator for he has delivered Gods words in a simple understandable format. The Quran is a miracle in itself and to translate is not an easy task and no translation will ever have the power of the original. This is a very simple and easy to understand translation and I would highly recommend. Any such work that brings us closer to God has to be commended. Thank you
3,A useful translation,"The translation is accurate, so you get a good idea of what is in the Qu'ran, but it is so sanitized that the passion and flair of the original is totally lost. It's like reading an explanation of a poem, useful, yes, but it lacks the majesty of a remarkable work. You will not come away from this book feeling Islam. You will only know about it."
2,????,Have no idea about this one .Is hard to understand QUr'an in our heart don't need be trans to English
3,Quran,I bought this edition of the Quran as part of a study project to better understand Islam and its written foundations. Excellent piece of work. More Americans should be familiar with its contents.
3,Useful middle translation,"As any translation of scripture is interpretation or commentary, this translation loses one star for not having included the Arabic original.Although less one-sidedly external than some translations (in the opening sura, for example, the translator correctly puts ""worlds"" in the plural and avoids, with additional emphasis in a footnote, ""His"" wrath, the footnotes are nevertheless almost entirely of the ""tafsir"" (external, historic comments) and quite rarely of the ""ta'wil"" (deeper inner meanings) varieties. Balance is lacking.The translation of the central Name Allah with ""God"" may be acceptable for an English language readership. However, the English word ""God"" is applicable as well to the demiurge and has a plural form. Thus, this usage tends to obscur the Qur'anic revealed edifice of divine Names."
2,The Qur'an Oxford World Classic,"I would look for a different translation. The Oxford World Classic edition doesn't use the same words as many of the other english translations, for example in chapter two, verse 191, Al-Fitnah is translated as persecution where other texts translate it as idolatry. Chapter 9 verse 28 Mushrikun is translated as ""those who ascribe partners to God"" in other texts it is translated as idolators. In some translations Idolators includes Christians and jews, in this translation, that distinction isn't clear. I compared three different versions and have three different translations. This translation is easy reading, but I am not convinced it is an accurate translation."
3,Changes some words,"I'm using this to write a report. I don't like how it changes some words like forget to ignore. It really changes the meaning of a passage when it says ""God ignored them because they ignored Him"" instead of ""God forgot them because they forgot Him."" It does this often. Sometimes it will make a note at the bottom of the page other times it won't. Overall if you want an unbiased/changed translation of the Koran you need to learn Arabic and read it yourself, which I am not ready to do so this is suitable for now but I am using it alongside other translations to get a better understanding for my report."
2,Pretty but disappointing,"This very pretty and readable Koran, is not as good as it appears. The translation is not bad and it is accurate, however lack of a good index can make searching for subjects hard, if one is looking for a Koran that they might use for reference or study this is not the one. If one wants a good read, with handsome text, and a good dust jacket then they might look this one up.Seth J. Frantzman"
3,Small book,"The book is kind of small, the fonts are hard to read. When I offered this to someone he felt lazy to read it because the characters were small."
4,the Qur'an (oxford worlds's Classics),"The book was delivered in approximately within the time required ,and the condition was good."
2,I Grew Up Reading this Book But No More!,"You may wonder why no more. Well, Turn to page 54 of this book, and read the fourth chapter, verse 34, and put yourself in my place when you discover this books permits the male to beat the woman, just because she is not a male. Here is the whole verse:""If youfear high-handedness from your wives, remind them [of the teachingsof God], then ignore them when you go to bed, then hit them.""No more. Good riddance!"
5,the real Quran,I bought this copy to read about the seventy-two virgins that a Muslim gets when he blows himself and someone else up. And the requirement that a Muslim kill at least five infidels a day in order to make it to Paradise.
4,easy read recommend it highly,It is a very easy read and an easy comprehension . You can cover a lot in little time. Recommended for anyone starting for the first time or for a group study .But you do need some thing more detailed (good tafseer) for a better understanding of the QURAN.
5,A surely better translation of Quran,"It has very good introductry part, which is must read for anyone new to understanding Quran. Translation is generally better and more accessible than other available."
5,"Modern, clear and easy to understand","For some time now I have been looking for an English translation of the Qur'an which accurately captures the meaning of the original as closely as possible.At last I think I have found it!Obviously when translating any book from one language to another, meanings can change or become distorted. However, I believe that this translator has done a truly wonderful job.Readers need not fear having to struggle with old fashioned language. It is well written and easy to understand with lots of very useful notes to help the reader along. It also has a very helpful introduction and is nicely laid out.Anyone who wants to learn about Islam and what Muslims believe should start with this book."
2,The Qur'an,"The Qur'anIf there is a book that should be burned than this is it. As a plagiarised work of sick, dated errors, the Old Testament is used to produce the Qur'an. That a large section of our world population believes in such, no doubt accounts for the problems that Muslims are heaping upon themselves. Even worse is the mind destroying influence and misuse and brain washing of children by the use of this book. How deluded can you get? You would be better of believing in the flying carpet cause less harm, pain, suffering and destruction. For an overview of the errors of the Qur'an, amongst others, I recommend THE END OF FAITH by Sam Harris. The Hermit."
1,Hopefully it includes..,"Qur'an (5:51) - ""O you who believe! do not take the Jews and the Christians for friends; they are friends of each other; and whoever amongst you takes them for a friend, then surely he is one of them; surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.""Hopefully this translation accurately describes what's really in the Quran, and brings to light the darkness of islam, looking forward to receiving my copy."
2,Sanitized version of the Qur'an,"Author does everything possible to put a ""halo"" on the book and Islam. He is knowledgeable but very one sided. There are other books who try to make a more realistic view of Islam. I would suggest you look at them rather then this one. The author's words betray his political leanings. Shame on him!"
1,DON'T BOTHER!!,I ordered this and then they cancled it and put the posting back on Amazon. I don't know what kind of game they are trying to play. Sure doesn't make me want to buy anything from them. I needed a camera ASAP and now I have to find another one. They offered 5% off something else from them. Are you kidding me? 5%? What a joke.
1,DONT BUY IT BECAUSE ITS NOT THE PRODUCT YOU WILL GET,I NEVER TESTED THE MACHINE BECAUSE I WAS CONNED BY TIGER DIRECT PROVIDER AMAZON. THEY SENT ME THE DS-10 WHICH I HAVE NOT MUCH TO SAY ABOUT IT
4,Lovely Swarvorski Bracelet,I have recieved so many compliments about this bracelet...I kept one and gave one as a gift....she was thrilled!...It looks 'vintage'...and is quite charming....and what is more charming is the price!
2,bad hair care product,"I got this product line at a beauty salon i think this is by far the worst redken product out there i have dry wavy hair, when i first used this i did use the conditioner with this product and it did nothing for my hair it made it worse my hair became even more dry then it was and my hair started to get snarly i was quite surprised with this redken product since they are a very good company but i would not reconmend this product."
2,Weak-link in the Corelle Ultra line,"I bought 2 complete sets of the Corelle Ultra Scandia White dinnerware. I adore the plates and bowls. They are superb and look like fine bone china.However, the matching mugs leave a lot to be desired. First of all, they are too heavy/clunky. I think this is because they are not made from the same material that the dishes and bowls are.Second, and more importantly, they get HOT. When hot liquid is in the mug, you cannot grab it any other way than with the loop handle. And when you place your fingers in the loop, you must be careful not to rest your fingers against the side of the mug (as a lot of people would be inclined to do) or else you WILL get burned. You seriously cannot touch this mug anywhere but the handle without getting burned."
1,Best of What?,"After the first three songs, this hard rock band is painfully rounded off into a top 40 esque collection. Seems like the VH bros. still begrudge David Lee Roth. When he left, we heard tunes like ""Aint Talkin 'bout Love"" turn into songs like ""Why can't this be love"". Why can't this be rock? Because you can't substitute ""Mean Street"" or ""Take your Whiskey Home"" with ""Jump"". I guess VH inc. all but forgot about Women and Children first, Fair Warning, & Van Halen II--the albums that earned their reputation."
3,"Great music, sad selection","This is VH's first Greatest Hits album. The song selection stinks. Most of the songs are from the Sammy Hagar era, which, in my opinion, is not true Van Halen. And the DLR songs that were picked to go on the album are not the best. Missing are many of the classics that no metalhead should be without like 'Sinner's Swing', 'Light Up The Sky', 'Pretty Woman', plus many more. And even the Sammy Hagar songs were bad. They should have included 'Inside', 'AFU', or something else."
2,Not the best of Van Halen,"This was the first Van Halen CD that I every got. I liked listening to every song including ""Eruption"", ""Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love"", and ""Panama."" I later sold this album because I heard about the ""Best Of Both Worlds"" compilation. That album had the exact same songs, but they added like 10 more tracks to the album."
1,Don't waste your money.,"Just one word from a Van Halen fan. BAD! If something is a greatest hit album, make it a greatest hits album. There are so many songs missing. Listen fans buy a box set or wait for somthing better."
2,A disapointing greatest hits!,"Like the last person said, there where better hits then alot of what is on the collection of crap! I bought this expecting that the songs i already knew ""eruption"" ""pannama"" ""jump"" ect would have songs just as good? but i was wrong, maybe if it had a second disc, or a greatest hits 2 with it it would have been more worth the while? one that was not mentioned tho that i beleive shouldve been there was ""good enough"" ..... so basicly, where the hell is ""you really got me?"" ""Pretty woman"" ""good enough"" ""hot for teacher""? this choice of songs was not thought out very well!"
3,A very worthy compilation,"This was the CD that really got me into Van Halen, but I'd ditch those two 'new' Roth tracks, since it was basically the reunion that wasn't meant to exist. Other than that, you get a lot of their best songs.But there should be a Volume Two, since they decided not to release a two-disc set of all of their best stuff; one disc of Roth, and one of Hagar. That would transform this compilation from great to KILLER!!But since they decided not to do that, what you have is about 14 or 15 of the best songs of VH's entire career, including ""Panama,"" ""Dreams,"" ""Right Now,"" ""Eruption,"" ""And The Cradle Will Rock,"" and ""When It's Love."" For those just getting into Van Halen, this will give you a fix of them, and will leave you wanting more of their music together. Look at me: first VH CD I owned, and now I'm hooked on them, and always will be."
3,A Good Sample,"Van Halen were the premier purveyors of bad metal in the eighties, their `by the numbers' approach, complete with embarrassing macho posturing and guitar heroics, became the standard that bland copycats like Poison and Whitesnake were aping. Not that Van Halen were that exciting to begin with, but they did set the standard for 80s corporate rock. This is the music beloved by insecure 7th graders and software geeks who still think like insecure 7th graders everywhere. This album includes mega hits `Panama' and `Jump', and will doubtless please fans of the genre, all others will not be impressed. C"
3,Just scratching the surface.,"OK, Volume 1 should be nothing after about 1984. And, for the venture that they set out upon, why take up space with three new songs when there is so much more Van Halen, from the old catalogue, that belongs on here??? And where is Volume 2, Volume 3, hell, you could be up to Volume 4 by now."
3,Humans Being,"Hey, probabbly ""Humans Being"" was only on there because people from Twister gave them money and publicity. I don't know, I'm only 20. hehe"
2,Not Nearly As Good As Expected,After it took FOREVER for van halen to come out with a greatest hits album you expected it to be incredible but it is not. The two hyped new DLR songs are only okay and there is waaay too much hagar on this and not nearly enough DLR. My recommendation is to buy van halen 1 instead which is a CLASSIC album that changed hard rock forever.
3,too many omissions,"With 10 hit LPs to draw from, this should have been a double CD (as was originally planned), since there are too many glaring omissions. I would suggest the following for Vol. 2:1. You Really Got Me2. Ice Cream Man3. You're No Good4. Beautiful Girls5. Everybody Wants Some!6. Mean Street7. Hot for Teacher8. I'll Wait9. Love Walks In10. Best of Both Worlds11. Black and Blue12. Finish What Ya Started13. Mine All Mine14. Runaround15. Don't Tell Me (What Love Can Do)16. Amsterdam"
4,Great Band - Great Collection of Songs,"Do you really need to ask if this CD is good? This CD is essential to any fan of Van Halen. There is a pretty solid collection of songs from David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar. The new songs from David Lee Roth are pretty cool too. The only reason this CD doesn't get 5 stars from me is because it is missing one of my favorite VH tunes Ice Cream Man, otherwise this CD is excellent! Buy it Now!"
3,Me Wise Magic is the worth the bucks,"I don't get greatest hits cd's. If you're any kind of fan, don't you have all these tunes anyway? But for 2 new ""Dave"" songs, I didn't mind the indignity of putting a few more of my dollars in Eddie's pocket. I hope he realizes that having Dave on a record is the only way to sell cd's to a real Van Halen fan. By the was the DLR Band's new one will rock you. Ckeck it out"
2,Alot of hits are missing!!!!!,"I would not call this the best of cd, because not all their great songs are on here. Songs like ""Ice Cream Man"", ""I'll Wait"", ""Hot For Teacher"", ""Top Of The World"", ""Finish What You Started"", ""Not Enough"", ""Don't Tell Me"", ""Love Walks In"", ""Best Of Both Worlds"", and ""Summer Nights"" are all missing. ""Humans Being"" is cool, but the new Dave songs .... I think they should have done a 2cd set w/ a Dave disc and a Sammy disc. Though all the hits rock on here they should of added alot more."
4,David Lee Roth Rules,"I always think of David Lee Roth when I think of Van Halen. The first 8 tracks are Van Halen and the rest are Van Hagar. The true fan will always remember the group when DLR was the lead singer. Although Hagar's vocals may seem a bit more polished, I liked Roth's raw talent and ability to make the lyrics come to life. I certainly hope that one day DLR and the Van Halen's will get together and make a new CD. Until then (if ever) this album as well as most of their early stuff is the best rock you can listen to. The only other one that comes close is Def Leppard's vault of hits."
2,Needs a second disc!,"So many key tracks were left off, From Dave's era Janie's crying, You really got me, Atomic punk, Beautiful girls, Mean streets, Hear about it later, Dancin in the streets, Where have all the good times gone, Pretty women, I'll wait; Hell, where's Hot for teacher?Sammy's half lacks 5150, Summer nights, Best of both worlds, Finish what ya started, Judgement day, The Dream is over, Runaround, and Top of the world.This compilation re-inforces my belief that greatest hits are just the record companies out grubbing for cash.The new tunes Can't get this stuff no more and me wise magic are alright, it's great to here David Lee Roth behind the mic again. Download 'em if you can. VH fans starting from scratch might be better served with the individual albums. Check used record stores."
2,"Too Many Tracks Missing, New Songs Great","This is a terrible Van Halen compilation. They are missing the classic songs from the albums that gave them their fame. However, the three new songs are great. The band's magic has been instantly restored to the VH camp with the return of David Lee Roth. Don't waste your money buying the CD, just download the three new songs in MP3 format"
4,Nice,"Thought there would be more songs from the first singer but a nice collection if you like VH's music. I bought best of vol. one because I like the earlier harder edge rock tunes, however this is a good - best of classic rock."
2,"Not Deserving Of The Title ""BEST OF""","After Hearing This Album, I was pretty disappointed. It did include alot of good songs from their major albums, but not only was their some of their best songs, but to totally destroy the purpose they threw in 2 new songs (both of which are major throw-aways"" and Van Halen's worst studio track from the Twister Soundtrack. So, if this is a ""BEST OF"" collection, I wonder what the WORST OF VAN HALEN would sound like?? Probably like a Limp Bizkit CD?? You should stick to the studio albums rather then this ... ... hits collection..."
2,Where is Dave?,"Annoying as he now is, back in the day Dave was IT. So where is he? I was really dissapointed with this disc. When I put it on in the car I listen to about the first half, and then start skipping through the lame Sammy 80's crap. Just buy Van Halen 1."
3,"UHHHHH, This is a bomb!!!!!","""Best of v.1"" was anything but!!!!! I love Dave but just LIKE Sammy. Where is ""I'll Wait,"" ""Jamie's Cryin'"" and a lot of Dave's other stuff that was good? I hope the next installment has some better tunes on it than this one does."
3,Incomplete collection,"14 of their very best? B.S. Man,VAN HALEN getting cheap on the fans here. VAN HALEN had way more than 14 hits. So THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS is the double CD that we waited 8 long years for. It has more than what you'd get out of this single CD. Buy this only for the wack tracks ""Humans Being"",""Can't Get This Stuff No More"" and ""Me Wise Magic"". Hell you can download them...maybe."
3,For the Money only.....a rip-off to the fans,yes of course the CD is great!! After all it is Van Halen. But in case I'm mistaken I have these songs already. And to lose Sammy to two songs with David....NO THANKS. Sammy said it best when it was stated that GREATEST HITS albums are for the MONEY only. Don't let Eddie fool you into thinking otherwise.
3,Why can't this be love,"This collection definitely whets my appetite for more Van Halen music, but it falls short of what one would expect from a best-of album. Split between the David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar years, it condenses the history of this great band into a smattering of songs which arguably aren't always the best selections. Still, it offers an enticing taste of what you're missing if you don't have the original albums (especially those with Diamond Dave), which are pictured along with track listings in the cover insert."
5,A must have for any VH fan!,"Van Halen's the best of vol. 1 is a great collection of tunes from deep with in the bands vault. It covers 20 years of mind-blowing, blazing guitar by the man himself Edward Van Halen. Along with Michael Anthony on bass, Alex Van Halen on drums, and shared vocals by David Lee Roth, and Sammey Hager this powerhouse not only defined a generation, or a decade but the entire course of rock and roll. The Best Of is a must have for diehard Van Halen fans, as well as the average music lover."
5,The ultimate Van Halen collection to date,"This Collection is incredible. It was the first Van Halen cd I ever bought, and I am now completly hooked on the best band on the planet. The music on this cd spans the Dave and Sammy era, and has 3 bonus tracks, two of which feature Dave singing, eleven years after he left the band. It makes you wonder what could have happened if he had rejoined the band. the way this cd is put together make it flow like an album, not a collection, and the cover art includes photos and info about all VH albums through 1996. It is an exellent first Van Halen cd, and also an improvement to any VH collection. I give it an unconditional thumbs up!!! And also Gary is a Great addition to the band. He is amazing on stage, and I welcome Gary to the Dave and Sammy and Eddy and Alex and Michel epic."
3,"Not bad, but....","If you're a longtime fan of Van Halen, you probably have all the other stuff anyway.This is fairly decent for a starter or for a new fan.Mostly for the three extra tunes and the end of the C.D.Otherwise stick to the originals."
3,vanhalen best of vol 1,the cd was okay but the two new songs with dave are just awful. his voice is so muffled you can barely hear what hes singing about. but besides that its a fare effort. to say it was complete. or that there was hits left off they could have had put on. yes but oh well. still a pretty good effort. i say if you gotta computer and the vanhalen collection make your own. save your self some dough. either way you would have to buy the best of both worlds collection. i think thats a better collection than this rip off.
5,BEST VAN HALEN,IF YOU WANT THE BEST OF VAN HALEN FOR A GOOD PRICE THIS IS IT. I LOVE THIS ALBUM & ITS AMAZON PRICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Stop being silly......WE WANT DAVE,"I loved these songs from there org. albums. Sammy has a good voice and all but here's the thing....David Lee Roth, Eddie, Alax, Mike, This is the band. The 2 new songs are outstanding.Me and 50,000 friends are waiting for THE Van Halen to come to Chicago."
4,Better than most cds!,"I highly recommend buying this cd! The best tracks on this cd are ""Running with The Devil"", ""Unchained"", ""And the Cradle Will Rock"", ""Panama"", ""Jump"", and ""Dance the Night Away."" Seven good songs make this cd worth buying. However, this cd is missing great songs such as ""Jamie's Cryin"", ""Beautiful Girls"", ""Feel Your Love Tonight"" and ""I'll Wait"" This cd could have been a lot better if there were no songs from Sammy Haggar. Sorry, David Lee Roth is Van Halen!"
5,BRILLIANT!!!!,Buy this CD NOW! Its great and I dont think there is one track on this album that is not good.
4,All your favorites,"Classic CD. This cd has all of your favorite Van Halen songs, you will not be disappointed. Good classic rock and roll. Solid."
2,Why Buy It?,"I won't buy anything with Van Hagar on it. While this CD has a bunch of actual Van Halen songs, there's way too much of that dork Sammy on it. Not only that, but too many great classics are missing. I will just continue to collect the original albums. Forget the best ofs anyway. They always suck.Van Hagar is not Van Halen and will never be. I can't believe any self respecting Van Halen fan would fail to realize that."
1,Dave > Sammy,"The United States Government should pass a law banning the inclusion of any Sammy Hagar-era Van Halen songs on a compact disc that also contains David Lee Roth-era Van Halen songs. I'm afraid some unsuspecting listener will go into shock when he hears how much this once mighty band started to suck when Sam took over the vocals. If this disc serves any purpose, it is to reinforce what most people already know: Dave ruled and Sammy was lame. If you buy this CD, it means you loathe yourself."
5,More Dave!!! More Dave!!,"I totally loved this cd. The Dave songs were very familar, and the Sammy stuff was totally new to me, and I still liked them.However, whenever I turn on the radio and hear Van Halen, its almost ALWAYS DLR singing, except for maybe ""Right Now"", or ""Why Can't This Be Love?"". Maybe its because Dave made more albums, or because of VHI or 1984. But there are many songs of his that should be on here, (""You Really Got Me"", ""Pretty Woman"", ""Jamies Cryin"", ""Mean Street"", ""Everybody Wants Some!!"", and ""Hot For Teacher"".As far as the 3 new songs, ""Humans Being"" and ""Can't Get This Stuff No More"" are merely mediocre. But ""Me Wise Magic"" is so good, it is worth it to put this on the album even if it wasn't new!!!I'm under the impression that Van Halen wanted to give an even time to both singers, and an even time for all their albums. While this is nice, its not the best representation. However, even if this wasn't a TRUE greatest hits cd, its obviously a 5-star rating."
2,Good player for a while,"Bought this player for my son. Right off the bat, he had problems, but the Centon technical support was helpful and was able to help me reformat the player. Had no problems loading songs onto player. After only 2 months though, we were at an outdoor event. He put the player in his front pants pocket, sat down, stood up, got the player back out and the screen was cracked. Never dropped it or hit it. Centon refuses to warranty it, so now we're out a player. Think I'm unhappy? You bet."
3,"Does not play mp4, User Interface is terrible","It does not play mp4. It boggles the mind how they can call it an mp4 player when it does not support mp4. The user interface is terrible, truly unintuitive and a pain to work with. That said, once you figure out the players quirks and limitations it works fine."
4,Lifetime Basketball System 71922,"The Lifetime BB system is very good quality. However, I think people should know that it requires a large amount of assembly. You need socket wrenches and other tools. It came with many, many bolts, nuts, screws, washers, brackets and other metal pieces. We had to hire someone to put it together for us. The instructions for assembly are not very clear. The book has something like 37 steps for putting the system together."
4,Lifetime 71922 Portable Basketball System,This basketball system is very well designed and manufactured. We found the pole assembly instructions somewhat confusing as to which holes to use and when. At first we assembled the middle and bottom pole sections aligning the wrong holes and had to drive them apart and reassemble. I am using this system at my home and find the easy height adjustment a nice factor when setting up the unit for my young grandchildren.
4,Right Good Set,"I enjoyed Majorettes, it was a well done low budget slasher, didn't care for Hitcher in the Dark too much it was kind of slow, but the real treat here is the full length Joe Bob Briggs commentary over Hell High, he made a somewhat entertaining slasher in to top notch laugh out loud riot, fans of Joe Bob will definitely want to pick this one up."
2,3 unwatchable movies,"As a fan of the horror genre, I can put up with and stomach alot. However, I can't sit through 3 crappy movies in a row. I just won't do it and you can't make me. I did give it a try though for this boxed set but it wasn't a trilogy of horror but rather a trilogy of garbage. I should have known better..."
5,excellent,Mind Power is a book that everybody ought to read. As usual Gary Null is straightforward and down to earth. Prevention of diseases is the best way to stay healthy
3,Shocking Conclusion??,"Six stars!?? Don't think so... While I do think that the title of this book would throw the majority of readers off I doubt that the ending would suprise most. I knew well before the end that it was a case of split personality... And what was with that romance storyline that seemingly got wrote out of the book about half way through... I don't get it.For shame Dr. Curtis, for shame."
5,A real page turner.,Don't let the title put you off - Visual Words: Art and the Material Book may well be the sleeper hit of 2002. Pages turned as if by magic. You'll hardly believe the shocking conclusion of this sexy thriller! Five stars? I give it six!
3,Times change. Drive died.,"PROS:For $200 AR, it was a steal in Aug '05.CONS:The Safe Shutdown feature does not work for me (on Mac OS X).The warranty is lousy, and worries me some. (It's 1/3 as long as their normal warranty on the bare drive!)I just saw a 250GB HD + USB/Firewire enclosure bundle for $90 AR; prices have dropped fast.Hadn't had any connectivity or reliability issues 'till it died suddenly, Oct '06.I haven't used it as much as I thought I would. But when I do use it, it's more useful than I expected it would be."
1,Waste of money,"When I plugged this into my computer and turned it on, it caused my computer to reboot by itself every 12 minutes or so. I tried everything to find out what was causing that to happen and how to fix it to no avail. I still haven't figured out why it kept shutting down and restarting my Mac and now I'm S.O.L. because I can't return it to Amazon without the styrofoam packing material that came inside the box (which I threw out)- a dumb rule. A complete waste of my money. If you have a Mac OS X, don't waste your time or money like I did!"
4,Capacity,"I have not tried this drive yet i am still waiting for it so iw ill update this in a few days i jsut wanted to let people know that when a drive says 320 gig or what ever the size it is not 320 gig. That is a marketing ploy because the way the metric system is. The actuall drive is smaller because that is how the computer reads it. no matter what drive u buy (external, internal) and no matter what brand you buy it is the same i have looking into this completly and asked my professors about it at virgina tech. so dont worry about that but if it is anyhting like the other two internal wd drives i have it is going to be awsome"
1,I returned b'cos it require a/c power always.,I thought external Drive means directly u can plug into USB and can work..but it is different it always require a/c power which i dont like..and i got only 289BG when i got it from amazon.people say i need to format to get 320GB. i dont know why it is required.
4,Great additional space,"The additional space this drive provides was of primary importance to me. The USB 2.0 provides a quick way to backup important information. At the time, Western Digital was offering a rebate as well, so for the price, this drive couldn't be beat - especially for a reliable name brand. The software that comes with the drive is a bit unintuitive. After spending some time playing with it and setting it up, you shouldn't have to adjust it too often."
1,Died within months,"It was still under warranty (last year), but I didn't want to return it and definitively lose all data and programs stored there. I've been away and haven't had time to try a new drive case; maybe I didn't want to know the stuff is gone forever.Really, really infuriating.UPDATE: New enclosure solved problem. Drive was/is fine."
1,External Hard Drive,"Item was received OK, however item was defective and is now being replaced by WD."
4,Good secondary storage option,"Ordered this since I've been using a WD 120GB for the last two years. Best new feature I liked was the shutdown button on the front as it used to always bother me to just unplug the drive not knowing if all files were safe. Also, an extra USB port is pretty nice too. I like the fact that the drive is lighter and actually smaller than my 120GB :) It doesnt feel quite as tough as a result.Only reason it doesnt get 5 stars is because of the clunky two part power cord. This is a two-piece cord that has a weird connector that goes into the drive. Nothing simple that can be replaced if something goes wrong with this.Speed is quick over USB. Havent tried the firewire option or the software. Works well as a simple extra storage option."
3,All 320GB drives are actually 298GB drives,"To the people complaining about there only being 298GB of storage space on the drive, this has nothing to do with formatting and would be no greater on a normal internal hard drive. All drive manufacturers label their drives with numbers where 1GB equals 1 billion (10^9) bytes. To computers, however, 1GB is about 1.074 billion bytes (actually 2^30 bytes). When you take this into account, 320 marketing GB equals just a hair over 298 real GB. And, again, this is the same regardless of manufacturer or variety of drive."
1,Great Backup Drive...While It Worked,"Lasted about two months before it failed. Before it's demise it was very simple and easy to use. However, I would suggest going with a different brand in the future if you wan't a product that won't fail because you actually use it."
1,Poor Quality,This machine sounds like it is crumpling paper as it prints. In addition for such a full featured all in one to only have 5 direct memory buttons is pretty silly. My old MFC 4100 has 16 presets and is muc smoother in comparison.
2,Not so sure,"I've purchased this item and expected more. It really disappoints. If you want an effective multifunction machine, this is not it."
4,"So far, so good.","I've owned this machine for about 2 months and so far it is performing very well. The only issue so far is that when copying/faxing the feeder seems to send documents at a slight angle rather than straight on. But print quality is great and quick, and scanning is better than other prior Brother machines."
5,Works great w/ a network of Macs & PCs,This is the tough little brother of the 8860DN. I really don't think you can go wrong with this printer. Works as advertised and works great in a mixed Windows and OS X network.
4,"Great Printer, Just two Problems","This is a great printer. Excellent text quality and speed. The copy machine function also works great for an inexpensive machine. I use this machine in home-based business and I would highly recommend it, especially with the network functionality.I have just two slight probems. 1) the paper comes out curled 2) the scanner button does not work with Windows XP. To scan, you must use the Control Center software that comes with the machine. This is a known issue (check the Brother web site). Hopefully, this will be fixed in future updates."
3,"nice MFC, but requires a dedicated 15-amp circuit","This is a really nice MFC, but with a single 15-amp circuit in my basement/office and a 42"" LCD & my P4-based PC hooked up, even with the TV off, when this baby fires up it trips my PC's APC, it basically requires a dedicated 15-amp circuit or anything hooked up to your circuit will probably have a shorter life due to constant power fluctuations (most people won't realize this because they don't run an APC with monitoring software on the same circuit). I ordered an HP 3055 to replace this since it uses 1/3 of the power (300 watts at peak, brother uses 1032 watts at peak). Do a search on google for '7820N amp' (or any brother MFC model with 'amp' or 'watts') and you'll see what I mean, others have the same issue. I think all Brother MFC's suffer from this, it's a shame because it's otherwise a nice MFC for a good price."
3,Almost Outstanding,"After years of use from a HP LaserJet4m, I needed to consolidate my equipment with an all in one unit. After allot of research, I decided on the this Brother unit. It is faster and better than any of the older seperate scanners, copiers, etc, except in one catagory. Check printing is problematic. I use the old HP, in anther office, for printing single checks because the Brother simply cannot run them straight through. The factory customer service rep acknowledged this problem. If you need to perform this task allot, look elsewhere. Other than that, this is a dream machine."
5,Great Printer,This is the 3rd MFC-7820N that I have purchased. I have one at home and one in each of my offices. It is a great machine.
4,"Fast copier, but not a fast printer.","It copies documents really quick, but takes forever to print. If you print a lot, you might want to consider something else."
4,"Mostly a great machine, with one objection to scanning results.","Overall I'm extremely happy with this product. I've had it for years, printed thousands of pages on it, and it's been almost trouble free. My complaint is that when I scan pages using the automatic document feeder, the images appear at a slight tilt about half the time. The machine just will not draw them across the scanner at a perfectly straight angle. The PaperPort software that came with the unit is good, and it permits me to straighten out the image after I've scanned it. However, I scan a lot and this procedure can become very tedious. Speaking with Brother technical support did not get me anywhere. I was basically told to live with the problem."
3,MFC-8820DN is better,I highly recommend the MFC-8820DN instead of this model. It's about a hundred $$ more and it includes automatic duplexing (that's the 'D' in the model #) and it includes a network interface (that's the 'N' in the model #). The 8xxx models use high capacity cartridges which means about seventy bucks for > 6000 pages instead of fifty bucks for about 2000 pages for the 7xxx models. Think about it. After just a couple toner cartridges you'll have paid for the better machine!I didn't buy mine on Amazon as they don't sell that model. I don't know why - it's much better IMHO.
4,Great product. Great support.,"I have had this printer for the past 11 months and is perfect for my home office. I have had no problems getting this to work with Mac, XP, and Vista operating systems. Print quality is excellent. Scan quality is excellent. Having a networked printer is fantastic and I'll never own a non-networked printer after owning this.In the 11th month my printer started making a loud grinding noise. I called Brother support and a new printer was shipped out. I wish other companies had product support as good as Brother's.All in all, great printer. I'm very happy with mine."
3,"Great AIO printer, little disappointed with build quality","Purchased in June, 2006. Unit performed great while it worked but paper feed mechanism broke in August 2008. Toner low message just started showing so I estimate usage at ~2,500 pages over the past 2 years. Closer examination of unit shows that plastic hinge holding down plastic gear is broken causing gear to not make contact with screw mechanism. Plastic gear also shows some wear from use. Unit is 1yr 3 months out of warranty.I'm a bit torn as to whether I'll send the unit in for repair or move on to a new unit. I've been very impressed with it while it worked but was hoping that it would last for more than 2,500 pages before breaking. IMO, it was a poor design choice to use cheap plastic on such a high stress part."
4,works fine - except the networking / software is kind of buggy,"Overall system is good. But there are several limitations - some of which are mentioned in other reviews. One problem is that if you want to receive fax to pdf, you must also connect the printer by USB to a computer - you can't just have a standalone network/ethernet set up. And if you connect the printer to a computer by USB, you can't have that same computer be part of the scan to group over the network (you can only have that computer be configured to scan to by USB). There are other little problems - quirks with the software. But overall I think it's a decent system."
2,"Good B/W print/scans, poor software and color scans","Used this unit for a few weeks and returned.Annoyances:Sofware: With ADF scanning, you have to enter scan parameters (paper size etc) again for every scan and it does not have an option to let you to continue scanning more pages then ADF can hold. You will have to use ""add to file"" function and select all scan parameters again. There is no option to scan double-sided pages as well with using 2 pass scanning. So 3rd party software is definitively needed to get a real value out of ADF scanning.Color Scanning: While B/W scans are fast, color scanning speed is very poor to me. Scanning stack of color pages could take ages. Slow color scanning speed was observed in both USB and network modes.FAX: Number of rings before FAX answers is limited to 4 and I found no way to increase that. No good for SOHO."
4,Nice product for what I need,I'm still having problems to get the fax manually. It does not make sense all the thinks I have to do just to receive a fax manually.
2,Skink smell - will not buy again,"We use this in my home office about 8'x8'. This one produces stink smell like burning plastic, which make myself dizzy in about 2 foot from it, and my 5-years-old coughs. Noticed this one has a fan worsen the stink, my other HP ptr without fan smells not this bad. We did exchange for a new one from factory, but the problem still. I guess it is the design itself.Otherwise, this would be a great printer."
1,Back Cover Open Error renders machine useless,"When working this is a great product. Unfortunately, there is a are known reliability issues with product. The ""Back Cover Open"" issue render my MFC-7820N inoperable after 8 months. I searched on web an it appears a significant number of machines are having same issue. Brother support offered no help and has been unwilling to recall product. I would not do business with Brother again."
2,"Good scanner, bad pinter","This machine scanned and copied fine, but when we tried to print envelopes there were ghost images everywhere and it kept jamming. When printing regular sheets, it pulls the paper in a way that leaves it with a curl at the edges. Not good if you're trying to print something that is supposed to look professional. The only plus I can give it is its Vista compatible.I would not recommend this if you're going to use it as a printer."
1,frustrating paper waster,"We have had same experience as other reviewers - after about a year of reliable service, the machine jams constantly. We are at the point where we throw away 3 crinkled, jammed pieces of paper before we get one decent copy. Very expensive and unproductive. I think I'm going to try a Dell 1815n or Canon MF4690. Dissapointing as my previous experience with Brother machine was great."
3,ok for the price,"The toner cartridge supplied malfunctioned at the start. It took over a week and several long wait calls to get a replacement.The unit now works.Quite fast, some paper wrinkling due to heat,cheap plastic housing, but alot of function for the price."
5,3+ Years of happy operation,"I've had mine for over 3 years and have been very happy with the continued high performance and quality. I'm using it for home-office stuff, with 30-50 sheets per week and weekly scans for expenses, plus some occasional faxing or copying.No complaints."
4,"Good product, but there are better sheet feeders","I bought this as an upgrade for my 1 person office. I went from an HP that did a great job with printing and scanning, but lacked a flatbed copy function to this. Generally, I'm pleased with the product, but the scanning function is a bit cumbersome and the sheetfeeder for the bypass tray does not always do a good job with envelopes."
2,Get ready for Junk Faxes,"The machine has worked great and has many advanced features that go above and beyond many other fax machines (in addition to its multifunction abilities). However, as soon as we registered the fax with Brother, we started getting a lot of junk faxes. We called Brother and they denied selling our information to marketers and said there is nothing they can do. However, we have had a fax number and other machines for quite some time without any problems. Now, we get junk faxes ringing at our home at 2:00 am and throughout the day (just days after registering this new machine with Brother)."
1,Worst paper feed ever,"jams all the time, always grabs 2 or 3 pages when it's feeding. you have to watch it like a hawk. Absolute waste of time and money unless you want to audit every fax and copy job page by page to make sure it didn't fee doubles. Horrible machine."
1,Stay away from this All-In-One printer/fax/scanner,"I owned this All-in-one product for exactly a year until it stopped working. It showed me an error message of ""back cover open"". Nothing I did helped resolve the problem and customer support did not help. Though it is user friendly and works well with my iMac, I would never buy brother again."
4,A REAL Report ! !,"Just got the new multi function center about a week ago. Was packed very well in the box. Came with everything that you will need except a USB or ethernet cable. Took it out of the box, set it up, no problem. We have windows Vista and I was worried that it may not have the most current drivers in the box. It had all the supporting software for Vista, XP, Mac, and so on. The software instalation went very well. It didn't seem to be super easy. Had to think a little to set it up properly...could have been a little better. So far, so good, prints, scans, faxes, and copies with no problem. You do not need a dedicated phone line. I have a answering machine and it all works just fine.Thats All For Now,W W"
4,Brother MFC-7820N 5-in-1 Network Monochrome Laser Multifunction Center,Works fine. We only use it for printing and copying. Installation was difficult for this amatuer when trying to get our network PCs to hit it. Our IT guy had no problems.
2,"Bad Product, AWFUL Company","This printer has been a lemon. The drum failed just past the 90 day warranty. The whole machine failed under warranty, but Brother is hopeless to deal with, so I'm still trying to get the warranty work done."
1,very disappointed,"The item received in a very bad shape, damaged and broken. We are having a hard time getting our money back now"
3,Serious Paper Jam Issue,"We've used this printer for about 2 years, it has always jammed the paper occasionally, but at 25,000 prints it started jamming frequently (like every other print). I looked online and found some info about cleaning the rollers, which I did. It did help some, although it still jams way too often, it has printed 30,000 pages now and the paper jam problem is progressively getting worse, probably 1 in 7 pages will jam, and I have to open the back and remove the jam. Other than this problem it is a good printer."
2,A warning for Vista users,"This is the 5th Brother printer I've owned and love them all. But this is the first printer I've bought since getting Microsoft Vista.Unfortunately, the Paperport software that comes bundled with this computer does not work on Vista (confirmed through Brother support). In other words, when you want to scan you have to do it through the basic OCR and imaging software Brother provides. Paperport is a great product and makes scanning files possible on this computer; the traditional OCR tools are pathetic and make the scanning feature virtually worthless."
4,"Very good printer, but scanner stopped working","I like this printer a lot. I use a PC with 32-bit Vista and it was easy to install. Copies are somewhat awkward to make and the scanner stopped working after about 2 years of continuous use, but the laser printing is fast and reliable. I have replaced the drum once in 3 years, which was not cheap. All said, I will probably buy another Brother printer, but not a MFC."
1,"Wouldn""t Own SGU If It Were Free","I have never watched a more conflicted series . It has not one character that I can relate to on any level. They spent twice as much per episode for this drivel than they did for SG-1 and SGA. What a waste, not only of potential but of resources that could have been spent on another series or direct to DVD films that would appeal to a much wider audience. The Stargate series have fans world wide not just here in the U.S. and SGU did not sit well with the majority of viewers. In its present form SGU will not be viable in syndication because no one will watch this series and it will have too few episodes to package to networks. Without a format change and the editing of current episodes into a more watchable format the series as it stands will never gain viewers.The producers need to admit they made a mistake going the direction they did and correct their errors. For TPTB to continue this series in its present form is sheer folly."
1,SG - Unviewable,"To be honest, I didn't write this but it struck me as the perfect one line review of SGU - ""Take out everything that made Stargate enjoyable, put in everything that made Battlestar Galactica tedious and call it Stargete Universe.""And even if you like the show - a half season release? Somebody's hitting the crack pipe at MGM."
4,Read the box,"The show is awesome. I do agree that releasing half a season at a time stinks. But, like with Battlestar Galactica it says on the box that it is season 1.0. So, for anyone who still hasn't bought it, just read the box then you won't be disappointed or upset when you realize it is only the first of the season."
1,Tired of being ripped off!,For the record. I like the show OK. This is not a review of the series. I am tired of Syfy (or whoever) trying to sell 1/2 season for the price of a whole. I don't care how good it is. I WILL NOT buy these half seasons anymore! I'm not against people making a profit. This is downright greed. SHAME ON YOU!
2,Total let down.,I got hooked on SG Atlantis the first episode and I'm trying so hard to get into this new spin off and it's just a total let down.It just wasn't worth the wait for me. They should have just kept SG Atlantis going for couple more season.I don't think it will last more than maybe two season if they really push it. Looks like the franchise has finally run its course justlike the Terminator.
1,"For those who love Stargate and Alantis, this will disappoint","Stargate Universe is a huge disappointment. One has to wonder what the writers were thinking this time around. Did they deliberately cut out all of the great qualities that made the franchise so popular in the first place. Where the original Stargate was bright, beautiful, exciting, and exotic, SU is dark, dreary, and dismal. It actually became too painful to watch, so I stopped after the 8th episode. It completely lacks the fun and adventure of the original, and worse of all, it's plodding and boring. It does not deserve the Stargate title. Unless you love misery, don't bother wasting your money on SU."
1,Very disappointing show!,"Very disappointing addition to the Stargate franchise.Not much science fiction, seems to be only used as a backdrop to personal conflicts of the characters. This is a product of the Sci Fi channel now Syfy. They seem to be moving far from their original core audience of science fiction fans. The first two Stargates had action and science fiction with character development. This offering seems to have concentrated only on character.Perhaps soap opera fans will like it; I doubt that any real science fiction fans will. Well, that is one viewer's opinion."
2,Poor Man's BSG--Sucks in all respects,"I am still in withdrawal from BSG (even if I think the series finale was a bit lame). This is like a poor man's copy of BSG written by sub-par writers and performed by sub-par actors. The crazy scientist dude has nothing on Baltar. Does anyone actually care about any of the characters? I am so desperate for a good new show that takes place in space, I have been willing to tolerate this crap, but it's *yawn* time to give it up. Please Please Please bring back Firefly!!!"
2,First half of season 1...,"Having been a Stargate fan since the beginning on Showtime, it was exciting to see a new series being spawned, but this is not the Stargate that I know and love. I've watched the first ""10"" 9 episodes and honestly there is only one good episode of the lot, ""Time"". Do not buy this ""10"" episode set. Wait till the entire season is complete and see if they will come out with a true season 1 boxset. Or if you must have it now, see if it is available on i-tunes. Don't waste your money with this!"
1,Stargate Universise the death of stargate,"This show is about the single greatest TV disappointment of my life I have been an avid Stargate fan since I first found SG1. Then I enjoyed SGA. So naturally I was excited for the next series, until I watched it. This show is downright awful. It slaughters the Stargate masterpieces. The show abuses cannon technology and has no plot at all. In addition, they didn't even use tripods to film it! Every shot is shaky and poorly shot, its like they hired a high school freshman to film it."
1,Easily the worst of the Stargate franchise,"I have been watching Stargate from long ago (since the release of the original movie). Really enjoyed the series, the last couple of season could have been improved. I liked Stargate Atlantis, but not as well as the original.Stargate Universe is simply poor TV. I struggled through watching the entire season hoping there would be something worth watching. I was extremely disappointed the way the full season ended (not this half season).Save your time and money and find something else to buy/watch."
3,Great Show - slack DVD distribution,"I really like the show itself. It brings again old Stargate starches like the unknown and discovery. But no matter how good the show is, it doesn't deserve to get split up into two parts per season. The statement, they like to include more special content than usual won't work for me. They could have either added 1-2 additional disks into one dvd-box or used the full capacity of the Blu-Ray medium.If you like the show and also like to have the DVDs/Blu-Ray, i suggest to wait how long the show will run. SG-1 had a collectors box, SG-Atlantis is releasing one now, and SGU probably will have one too if it runs a few seasons."
2,A Weak Start,"Being a Stargate fan since the first season of SG-1, I've found the first half season of Universe to be less than appealing for several reasons. Most of the stories unfold far too slowly. The atmosphere of the show goes beyond ""dark,"" gearing more toward dreary and mundane, with plodding human interest pieces which belong on daytime drama (aka soap operas). The sex scenes sprinkled throughout the series often do little to advance the plot, and only serve to smut things up. On top of all that, the music sucks.To summarize, this is not the kind of show fans came to know and love in SG-1 and Atlantis. Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing, time will tell, but personally I'm not enjoying the change. I really hope things improve with the second half of the season, or I'm afraid this will be Stargate's swan song before too long.My rating has nothing to do with the ""half season rip-off"" some other people have posted. It is based solely on the quality of the episodes."
1,The most disapoining P.O.S. I have seen,I loved SG1 and SGA I hate SGU and will never forget or forgive the studio dropping SGA for this Battle star galctica ripoff.
2,Very misleading !!!!!,I like the program but was bummed to find that it is only half the season. They need to be far clearer. No idea when the next section is coming out.
1,Not really stargate,"First of all this is another one of those ""half-season box sets"" that Battlestar Galactica made famous. People have realized that there is a certain price-point people are willing to pay for collected sets and so they just split the season up into two chunks of that price point... bad! This might work for an exceptional series but this is NOT an exceptional series. For most of the first 13 hours of the show we are treated to people doing inexplicable things in a trite situation and for a show called Stargate: Universe it spends more time in Washington D.C. than it does on all alien worlds combined AND it almost never actually uses the Stargate.This show should be avoided at all costs and especially at this high cost."
2,I am holding out ...,the show has promise but it will not be joining my two other complete SG series on DVD if it doesn't do a major turn around and fast ... at this point the writers have ruined EVERY character for me ... not one is remotely likeable ... I dont want reality .. I want like-ability LOL who wants to watch a show where you dislike even the most likeable characters ... the half season is lame too ... I rather wait for a full season.
2,Slow starter,"I Have enjoyed all of "" Stargate"" but this was a slow starter. the attempt military versus civilian drama started to early, International versus American Military might have been better Atlantis was an International team, now not so much, International/Inter planetary away teams were the norm,so much opportunity for dramatic conflict lost in Homogeny."
1,SyFy strikes again,"Another in a long series of HALF seasons from the SciFi, oops, SyFy, channel...or is is PsyFi now? I do not think they understand what a ""season"" is. Beware that this set only contains 10 episodes."
1,Wow what happened????,"Awful show. It's really amazing how far this apple of the stargate series rolled away from it's tree, hitched a ride and endded up on the other side of town. Definatly not continuing to watch this series, yet more even buy a half of a half ass wannabe stargate/SGA series. I think I'd get much more entertainment out of watching grass grow. Way to drop the ball Sci fi. Big let down."
1,Where is a black hole when you need one.,"I really wanted to like this, but It's Battlestar Galactica meets Days of our lives (not to slam either one of those show). It's a few hours you'll never get back."
4,Great series but wait for complete season 1,"If you read about SG-U first thing you notice is the two extreme views. Love it or Hate it. I really enjoyed SG-1, and more so SG Atlantis. I was very sad when SGA went off the air. I do however really enjoy SG-U and where they are going with this. SG-U has the real potential to open the Stargate world to a whole new range of fans. The character play has so far only been getting better, and I am eagerly looking forward to 2010 episodes. All that said, I know one who likes the show should buy this 1/2 season to support the studio and ensure it doesn't meet the same fate as FireFly/Serenity, but who likes falling for this 1/2 season tactic? Not me! SG-U is great, but I'll buy one whole season at a time thank you very much!"
1,Nothing ever happens,"As a Startgate fan of old, I sat through every single episode of SGU.Nothing ever happens. Period.You hope each episode that something will happen, and unfailingly nothing does.The characters are so fixated on themselves and their own personal drama, that the plot is totally stagnant.There is NO WAY I would pay money to own this. I will only watch it on Free to Air TV, if ever."
1,Stargate Fan,I've loved the Stargate Franchine so far. But this tendency to rip off viewers is getting out of hand.Don't buy this.
1,Buyer Beware,"I refuse to buy a season of a show that does not contain the whole season. This is, at least, the second syfy series that they have packaged this way. Please let them know that this is an unacceptable practice by NOT buying this product. To add insult to injury, they are charging ""full"" price for only ten episodes. As I can buy a full season of just about any other show (including other Stargate franchises) I will be spending my money elsewhere."
1,One star for the price.,"I'm not complaining about the series but the price. With 18 million unemployed and I'm scared that I might be next, this becomes a luxury. I will go through the trouble of going online on the sci-fi channel website and watch it on my Dell laptop. But if there's somebody out there willing to give this as a gift, put my name down on the list. Another option is waiting for it to be sold as used on Amazon. With 24, I collected all the seasons buying used from Amazon with two as FBA which helped with the S&H."
1,More like BSG than any SG,"The show is a dark mostly humorless and actionless soap opera. It has none of the charm of the first two series. It's like watching the newer BSG(after season one), but without the great characters. I am very disappointed."
1,"1 Star for merchandising, 4 for the show","It's really sad that Syfy (bad enough with the name change) decided to shaft fans yet again by splitting another season up into 2 parts. I'm really wondering when they're gonna start with the 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75 versions. What was wrong with full seasons at $40-50. They just HAVE to squeeze that extra $10 out of a person. Well buzz off. I'll just wait till they drop to $10 in a couple years and you lose whatever profit you could have gained from me, I guess that is if this show pans out but it does look VERY promising."
5,Lots of extended scenes,"I really enjoyed watching the commentaries and viewing the show from the actor's point of view. They give us a lot of insight into what went on during filming the episodes. There are also a lot of extended scenes that enhance the viewing. For example when Rush first went back using the stones, this scene was not in the original airing. It is on the DVD.Those that want to complain and not purchase will miss out on a lot of extra's like this.MGM will NOT sell the complete season before the show even airs. Those that are waiting for the entire season will be waiting until the Fall, most likely.Complain all you want people, while I watch and enjoy!!!!"
1,Half of season 1,"For some reason Syfy is in love with screwing their viewers. As they did with season's 2 and 4 of battlestar galactica they will be releasing a season 1 and a 1.5 to make you spend twice as much. Don't buy this, let them know this is unacceptable."
2,ALL I CAN SAY IS P.U,"THIS SHOW SHOULD NOT EVEN HAVE STARGATE IN TITLE, SHOW IS BORING,SLOW,WITH NO ACTION, LOTS.....OF WINEING, AS FOR HALF SEASON CRAP, THATS BULL... WHATS NEXT MGM ONE EPISIODE...? (JUST AS WELL, THINK THEY CANCELLED THE SHOW)"
2,Well . . .,"I do not like this series. My husband, however, does. I bought this for him. The only thing I was looking forward to was the Stargate 101 feature, which I cannot find.My main problem with this show is the fact that it is too much like Battlestar Galactica, which I refused to watch after about the third episode. I cannot stand the way the show is designed to feel so much like a soap opera. The purpose of science fiction is to give us hope, not to depress us with the totally unrealistic and depressing relationship drivel being pushed upon us in lieu of plot.I can say that some of the special effects looked pretty good, and I hope the show will improve as they go along with it, but I really don't hold out much hope for it. Thank heaven for tivo. My husband can watch it while I'm asleep, and I don't have to see it."
3,Huh??,"All right...like everyone else says...it fails to be stargate. Yea there is a circle in the ship that allows them to go off world. Wait what? Does that word exist in this show??? ""Off World""??? Isnt that what Stargate is mainly about??? I have been a HARDCORE FAN since the very beginning of Stargate SG-1 then to Stargate Atlantis! I love those shows! And I will admit I was super excited for Universe...but what is this? The characters could be likable if they didnt back stab each other every other minute. WAAAAAAAY over dramatic. Stargate is known for its sense of humor! Where is the Jack O'Neill??? Where is the John Sheppard??? Where are the characters we like. And I mean characters like them...not actually them. Although It would definitely help Universes situation here! Anyway, Im gonna stop complaining and keep watching HOPING that it will get better! I have faith in Stargate...don't let me down!"
1,We are being ripped off by pirates,I just thought to add that we are being ripped off by the real pirates.The large studios are the pirates not small consumers.Just look at these half-season sets.Now I have been supporting SG series since the begiining.I own all the movies and season sets.Unfortunately I will not be buying this ever in a new form.That kind of sucks because I do wantto support SG but I also refuse to bow down to studio greed.HEY STUDIO::::: READ MY LIPS !!!release full season boxsets or you will never get a dime out of me.soon I will just buy this used so you will not get my money.And as far as the show goes it is not your old SG but it is still interesting and iot is getting better.
1,GarbageGate,"SGU tries TOO hard to be BSG. Never gonna happen. Could Dr. Rush be any more identical to Dr. Baltar? The Asian chick is a bitch and a lesbian...hmm..who does that sound like?? *cough*-CAIN-*cough cough* They aren't even trying to hide the blatant copies. I have tried to watch this show on numerous occasions, but it continues to piss me off. I loved the first 2 SGs and BSG. All of the fun is gone, with none of the great storylines or acting of BSG, which they try so hard to emulate.Oh, and did I mention that this is a cheap,crappy BSG knock off???"
3,really?? another set of 1.0 1.5 series sales,"So this shows first group of episodes are a lot of Character development, and really gets going towards the final few episodes (though the first few are great, they are developing the characters mostly). So I see this show coming out of DVD/blu ray, and I think, wait, you have not delivered anything worth purchasing. I see SyFy SCIFI, may have changed their names, but up to the same tricks as with Galactica, I will not make a purchase of this until there is a full season to buy..........and neither should you."
3,"Not bad, but could be better","The biggest plus that this Universe has over SG1 and Atlantis is it's much more serious.The biggest down side (at least as far as seasons one and two go), is their is no main adversary. The majority of the time their dealing with problems within the ship. Now I could understand that the creators of the series want a few episodes to set things up, and I'd even understand halfway into the first season before their was a main adversary.The closest they've come to that is those blue aliens they dealt with for a few episodes a while back."
1,No More Half Seasons,"I buy a lot of SF series.SG1, Atlantis, Galactica,to name a few. I am NOT buying any more half seasons at full season prices.I work too hard for my money and I refuse to waste it anymore on half seasons."
2,I only Give it TWO stars because it's SCI FI,"If you LOVE soap opera drama, and love show's shot like they were made with a cheep HOME MOVIE technich, then this is the show for you. Otherwise this is very littel like Atlantis and SG1 wich I own all of. I wish they would Fire the Director and fix this show, or start another one."
2,"Ok show, but not a true SG show.","First of all if you liked SG-1 and SG Atlantis...great, but this show is nothing like either of those. The dialogue is bare with un-needed discriptions of human relations rather than about the Wrath, or the Replicators etc. Gone are fun missions on faraway planets, gone are badgering between Carter and the Colonel, or Carter and McKay. To be fair, the show isn't all that bad. It's just that this series should NOT have the title Stargate attached to it. The Atlantis series did SG-1 a great service to the series and brought with it all of the expectations any Stargate fan might have. So for your own benefit, if you do choose to take a gander at SG Universe, try to forget any ties to the original SG series, and who knows, you might like it. I didn't, but I had my SG expectations."
1,A clever rip off....,"Every other TV series and certainly every other Stargate from SG1 to atlantis issues DVD sets in entire seasons - these clever people though hey - lets fool everyone by calling it 1.0 and let people assume that means season one. In fact its half a season. A total rip off and bordering on misleading advertising. You have to really dig and get the episode listing to actually see its only half a season. More fool me.Besides that - am very very dissapointed with the series - the episodes are are not engaging - and its hard to identify with all but a few of the characters,they overdo the negativity of the plots, and have an extremley fragmented and dissapointing idea of what makes a good episode... someone pass me a gun. A great opportunity lost, and a great lineage undermined."
1,"Another Half Season, No Way for a crappy show like this","Sorry, I would never pay for a half season. Wait for a few years, the whole series will be available at no more then $50 for multiple seasons.Rod."
1,Horrible,"Probably one of the worst sci-fi ever produced.Nothing, but bla bla, sex and tears and boring relationships between pathetic characters.It's definitely not Stargate, It's definitely not even sci-fi.Don't waste money and/or time, better connect nothing to your screen and watch white noise."
2,"I think I will pass on this one, how about you?","So far I'm not terribly impressed with the new Stargate series.I am not finding very much action, at little too much on the Soap Opera side.The first few episodes showed promise, but the last few have been fairly boring.I haven't found many of the characters very endearing, except for David Blue, playing Eli Wallace & Jamil Walker Smith as Ronald Greer.So far the series seems to be a little too much like Star Trek Enterprise for me.This is just my opinion, I have been wrong before, and I hope I am wrong this time.I once said Stargate SG1 would never last, based on the first episodes. Later of course I came to love it and Stargate Atlantis.I for one do not intend to buy this one, until either the series has proven itself, and a full season release is avalable.I interested to see what others think of the half season releases.If you intend to buy vote yes, if you don't intend to buy vote no"
2,"Very good show, very bad idea for half season sets","Loved previous Stargate shows and own every season set (all 15) Have been enjoying Stargate Universe, thou it is a bit different, it does have a lot of potential, But I will not be buying it on dvd. I agree with others, give us a single season set at a reasonable price, not this half a season for the price of a season. Sorry, guess you are targeting someone else with that idea."
1,"Yawn, Boring, Uneventful, Shallow, Weak, Boring","I am a total Stargate Freak and have every season of SG1, Stargate Atlantis and every SG Full length movie released. I was so looking forward to SG Universe when I heard that it was to be released. I must say that I have never, ever been so bored in my entire life. It seems as if the production unit figured they could come up with anything, say anything and do anything and we would chomp at the bit. Guess what? This horse is not that hungry to chew on dry white bread that has about as much flavor as rancid mayonaise.This is one series I can certainly do without.2 thumbs DOWN."
1,Totally misleading Title,"Don't get fooled into thinking you're getting a full season of Stargate. This is only the first 10 episodes of a terrible show trying to cash in on the Stargate name. I couldn't make it through 4 hours of this series before I turned it off. The characters are miserable, whining, and self-centered. The plot is non-existent. The pacing is the best sleep medicine you could take.My best advice, go watch SG-1 or SGA or any other scifi series, stay away from this garbage."
2,Why!,If this is the future of Stargate I am sick and can only ask WHY!!!!! cancel such a great sci-fi series as Stargate Atlantis to bring us this garbage. This is just more fodder to stimulate the sheep that eat this crap up while the true loves of sci-fi action stand tall with pride to the memories of the great shows of the past that helped shape our lives.JRK
1,Overpriced,"I really like this show, but this is a ridiculous price for 9 episodes. It comes out to more than $4/episode. It would be cheaper to buy it on Amazon's VOD. I don't mind if they split the season into different sets, just price it accordingly, or at least include the DVD versions with the Blu-ray versions like the new Harry Potter and Up."
1,Better you should view a test pattern,"I hate this show . I dont care it its half a season or a full one this is a waste of money. I love Stargate,and i really loved Stargate Atlantis and to think that great show was cancelled for this crap stinks.Syfy is my favorite going all the way back to the Twlight Zone and more recently Odyssey 5 but this show is just stupid and boring. I wish they would bring back a great show like The Dresden Files and cancell this crap,i would not take this dvd for free."
1,This is a waste of your time and money!,"I'm a fan of Stargate, Lost and BSG. And one wonders why I hate SGU so much? It's because it looks as good as Stargate, Lost and BSG. But it feels like something you won't like to take in your hands, because it's soft, warm and brown. And if television could smell, it would surely smell like it too.The concept of Stargate Universe let's me doubt the sanity of the producers. How can they do a boring series like that? I simply can't understand that people earn money for such a waste of time. This is simply bad writing. But I know the writers are not the one's who are to blame. I know, they can do better! It's R.C. Cooper and B. Wright who are responsible for that... bah, I can't use the word! It's disgusting!Go and watch the worst episodes of the series I mentioned above and you'll see what you get in SGU.But to be fair... If you like daily soaps without thrilling stories, go and buy this series! You'll like it. It's really worth your money."
5,A Well Crafted Stargate,"Are we watching the same program? This show is turning into a really well crafted science fiction series. I love how it's more realistic than the previous Stargates. Granted, traveling the universe in a wormhole is fantasy, but it were possible, this is how it would be. I also love the pacing of the series. We're getting to know the characters, the ship, and the situation our crew is in. As they discover things, so do we. The absence of Star Trek type rubber faced aliens is also a plus. I will always love the original SG-1 team. They are the best. However, I am really enjoying the crew of the ancient spaceship Destiny and hope their journey back to Earth takes a few more years."
3,Too much soap in my sci-fi,"I've kept watching SG:U mostly because I'm a fan and collector of the other Stargate series. Each episode has about 5-10 minutes of fantastic science fiction and drama (Destiny refueling, Eli keeping a gate open with his hand, Destiny aerobraking), but I have to ""pay"" for it by watching 30 minutes of soap that barely holds my interest. I wish the crew would jettison the Ancient communication stones, collect the basic necessities of of life--I can only watch them scrounge for food, air and water so long--and start exploring Destiny and the Universe. I think with the first half of the season out of the way, the writers can potentially move the show in a new and more interesting direction. I'd consider purchase of SG:U if the series turns itself around, but right now, I really have no desire to watch the episodes again."
1,THEY HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING!,What a joke this show is. I own all SG1 and SGA episodes and love them dearly. SG-U finally airs and IT IS NOT STARGATE! I watched the first 10 episodes hoping that Wright/Cooper would finally throw us a crumb but their ego will not allow any thing of interest to emerge. Do not waste money on this especially paying full price for 1/2 season. I have never felt so used and betrayed by a television program and SYFY.
1,Boring and Perverted,"Most of my thoughts have already been written in reviews of others. I just wanted to add my one star rating to the list. I did watch the first 10 eps thinking the show had a lot of potential. The first year of a new show can be shaky do to character and plot development. But this show didn't get better it got worse over time. Of course, to each his own but I found it very boring and perverted to the point where after ep 10 I couldn't watch it anymore. By perverted I refer to the ""lost in space"" group being able to go back to earth by mind transfer and use the body of another person to do whatever. And whatever is what they did without any respect for the other person's body. Yes, it is just a show. I watch shows to be entertained and amused. This was neither."
1,Abysmal excuse of Stargate show,"This entire show is an absolute catastrophe. Boring, illogical, characters that no one cares about, and stories that are horrendous at best. To put a ""Stargate"" label on this garbage makes a mockery of the franchise. I am starting to see why SciFi, SyFy, Seifei, or whatever they are calling it today, is starting to drop in viewership faster than a lead balloon in a black hole. For God's sake, cancel this monstrosity already."
1,I do not like this,"It's simple: I do not like this because it's too dark. After half a season we still don't know much about the characters. With their ability to go home every once in a while, too much soap opera drama ensues as well as a lack of sense that they are stranded millions of light-years away from our solar system. I don't care that some corporation is trying to take over the project. What are they going to do so far away? I don't care that so-and-so is having an affair with someone's wife. These people need to focus on the task at hand - like getting back to earth. hello?Sci Fi is supposed to be about hope and examine the human condition. This show is depressing and it just shows how selfish &/or disturbed everyone can be. After a while I started to wonder who let these people in the stargate program anyway? I understand trying to appeal to adults but please, adults do have brains. Give us something that is more interesting and challenging other than the dark-lit soap that it's become."
1,STARGATE UNIVERSE,"This has got to be the worse Stargate production in history. It's boring, the characters are blane and the storyline is horrendous. I would not recommend this production to anyone."
5,not everyday an A list actor goes to american tv,Robert Carlyle is one of the best all time actors. Not opinion if you have ever seen an example of his work. Trainspotting if you've never seen check it out. If they can keep him the show will be good
5,long lasting,Just try to find one of these at Walmart! It was shipped promptly and appears to be a longer life bulb ie. 30 volts.
3,Cash Gospel,The song that I really wanted on this album was only partly sung with only 5 parts instead of 10.
5,One of my favorite albums,"I love some Johnny Cash music, but this CD has become a favorite of mine. To me it reveals the man as he was toward the end and he sings these songs true to form. If you like Cash you should enjoy this album and if you enjoy hymns and spirituals you should enjoy it even more."
3,Auto Vent Shade,"Product is ok but, not worth what I paid for it... Would have been much more satisfied if I'd paid $25.00 dollars for them...Having worked in manufacturing plastic for 15 years I know what the mark-up is on molded products."
5,A great anthology of the drug cultures best,"A great anthology of stories, one of the most complete piles of drug culture writers around, giving one a brief look into a plethora of great writing that will lead to further investigation of their works by teasing them with this fine book. Packed with writers from all over the spectrum and many genres, old and new alike. A Must have for those deeply in love with the drug culture. This book gives the reader a taste of many great writers out there, all with mounds of their own material that needs to be read, this book can prove as a lead in to these readings and makes for an excellent leisurely taste of what is out there for those who desire it."
4,COOL COVER,Not the best drug related book I've read but certainly not bad either. You'll find the usual suspects lined up to tell you about their experiences in dimensions beyond the known. I don't believe it's true to say that there is nothing more boring than listening to other people describe their acid trips. A lot of what's in White Rabbit is pretty interesting although not as interesting and inspired as the Jefferson Airplanes classic song.
3,Dated and Quirky -- not best intro,"It's cheap, it's a classic, and it's got a sense of humor. These wouldseem good reasons to choose this as your intro to game theory.On the other hand, it's dated, the elaborate writing style canget tiring, and most importantly the ideas are not communicatedvery well. For example, there's quite a bit of focus atthe beginning on the formalism itself (the payoff matrix),instead of tying to applications and intuition.I highly recommend Philip Straffin's book on game theory as analternative. My son and I were reading The Compleat Strategysttogether and he found it a turn-off. We switched to Straffin'sbook and are both enjoying it. The pedagogy is excellent, thewriting is clear, and there are many examples and exercises.It not only gets the ideas across better -- it is also moreprecise, with many explicit definitions, theorems, and proofs.Game Theory and Strategy (New Mathematical Library)"
5,Witty Intro to Game Theory and Zero-sum Games,"I share the feedback of the other reviewers in that this book is extremely fun to read, very well-written and comprehensively covers (thoroughly teaches the so inclined) a few aspects of game theory. The drawback is that it limits itself, consciously it seems, to zero-sum games played between two players. So after reading this book, you have no excuse for not being able to solve any such games. The narrative, the examples and the exercises take care of this. However, you will learn near nothing about non-zero-sum games, which are in actuality more life-like (hence a probable reason for the complaint of one reviewer who wants more real examples).Nevertheless, this book is extremely well-written, and truly accomplishes what it aims: giving the reader an appreciation of the basis of game theory and teaching them to solve zero-sum games. And quite a many witty jokes come in extra!"
2,Beware!,"Warning: This book only tells you how to solve game theory problems, NOT WHY the solutions work! So you actually aren't truly learning game theory at all. It's really more an answer key than a primer on game theory. If that's what you want, fine, but if you're looking for an initial step on the road to UNDERSTANDING game theory, look elsewhere."
5,Very well done!!!,"I loved this book so much that I wrote the author telling him as much. As far as I am concerned, I wish this book was a trilogy. When Crono was buried under the avalanche and Solly got him out I thought : ""You fool! Let the old bugger die"". Well... I was wrong about Crono and glad he was kept alive. Not enough Mothri. I really really enjoyed them. Loved the way the original Zid settlers got screwed over and dropped on Zuul. Absolutely love the antitechnology church. You know it's well written when you read parts that make you angry.I give this book 5 stars because of my disappointment at having finished the book only to realize that there was no sequel."
2,Never really got off the ground,"Finding someone willing to fill this with helium was alot harder than I imagined it would be. All the transporting to fill it up banged up the product, put a hole in it, and the thing instantly became garbage. Wish it was made of a heavier/more durable polimer."
3,Small clock,The style and appearance of the clock are good except that the dial of the clock is small. The glass/plastic cover over the dial therefore is also small and seems to easily get glares. I might recommend this more for a smaller room not across from a window.
1,No Authority on Cuba,"This book comes across as opinionated musings from some random person. As if I just sat down and wrote my own opinions based on my brief encounters with the country. I have to admit, I didn't get very far into it. Could be that there would have been factual and insightful information in this book, but I wasn't going to wait around to find out."
5,use the putty knife to get under window frame,Looks great and easy to install. Use the putty knife as stated in the instructions to slightly raise the edge of mirror trim to get the shade fully under on the front edge. If you wipe with the alcohol pad and apply as directed you will have them perfect. Good instructions.
3,A Solid Effort!,"If you're one of the holdouts still managing your employees in what consultants would scornfully describe as a ""hierarchical"" style, you fall squarely into the target audience for Winning Teams. A sparse 105 pages are filled with general pointers about the benefits that your business can derive from teams, the strategies you should use to make your teams successful and pitfalls you should avoid. What the book lacks, however, are real-life examples. A few short case studies of teams in action would have added to the book's credibility (not to mention its page count). Despite this deficiency, we [...] recommend Winning Teams, which achieves its purpose by introducing the command-and-control generation to the concept of teams and providing a bevy of tips on motivating people, inspiring cooperation and building trust."
1,Disappointing,I bought this expecting to hear the songs I knew and loved. Instead they are new jazzed up versions with saxophone added. There is nothing on the cover to indicate they are different than the originals.
2,One really good track,"Track 3, ""For You Two"" is really infectious, ear-catching, singalong sunshiney pop like you haven't heard in eons by this husband and wife duo, Mark and Lisa Flora. This track is the album's high spot and once it gets in your head, it's likely to stay there for days on end. The remainder of the CD is filled with pleasant enough lite pop, most of them sung by the better half of the group. They cite their influences as being the Beach Boys, Beatles, Hollies, Jellyfish, High Llamas among other melodic masters as listed in the liner notes. The problem I have with the material, with the exception of the above-mentioned track, is that it just doesn't rise anywhere near the level of the band's influences. Perhaps if they'd add some other band members and put a little muscle in their pop next time out, they might record something really special. As it is, you get one superb track and 21 lesser ones (and some of those are just short instrumental filler tracks)."
3,"Good, but poor hardware design","The lens are very good as a sunglasses and to improve sight at night. No doubt about it! Mine lasted 3 days and the clip-on mechanism fell apart after removing it from my frame the third timeVery poor design for the price paid. Must be redesigned by the manufacturer, which I hope may read this message!"
3,Strangely Yellow World,"These sunglasses make the world bright and very yellow. They seem no better than normal polarized sunglasses at glare reduction. Could be worse, they could be rose-colored!"
4,Great Mix Of Hip Hop From 1998!,"This album features some of 1998's tightest hip-hop tracks! The best songs are Still Not A Player, Deja Vu, Do For Luv, Horse & Carriage, NORE, Get At Me Dog, Whatcha Gonna Do, Still A G Thang, and I Got The Hook-Up! Buy this album today!"
4,The last of royce...,"Dan Severn is a freakin' madman in this tournament. His fight with Taktarov alone makes it worth buying. Plus It's the end of Royce Gracie's reign as champion. The shamrock-gracie fight is long and frustrating to watch, but it's still the old, harsh UFC fighting."
3,one step back?,"While Dan Severn stepped up to the plate here, many of the other fighters did not, resulting in some lopsided, uninteresting fights. The long awaited re-match ""Superfight"" between Ken Shamrock and Royce Gracie ended up with the two fighters locked together in the same wrestling position for a very uneventuful 36 minute draw. Only for the purist."
3,"The dawn of the ""Age of Wrestlers""","This was an entertaining show, but had too much mid-level talent. The ""Age of the Westler"" which lasted until UFC 11 started here. The final match had wrestler v. wrestler and Severn actually performed well, using some submissions holds along the way. There was an impressive debut by Oleg Taktarov and Pat Smith had a good return performance. However, the competition wasn't that great. Some of the matches were very forgetable."
2,Horrible UFC event,"Don't waste your money on this one. The first fight is exciting, and it gets very bad after that. The Superfight between Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock is the worst fight in UFC history. One good match, one OK fight, and the rest make you sleepy. Don't get it."
2,One of the last UFC's fans would want to buy,"This UFC ranks somewhere near the bottom on my list. UFC VI champ Oleg Taktarov makes a decent debut, but the rest of the tournament's fighters will only impress the eyes of those with little appreciation for technique & a lust for blood. Also features the first Superfight in UFC history which should go down in the books as the second (to Shamrock vs. Severn 2) most boring so far."
2,"Simplistic, watered down, unrealistic, G rated","After reading about the series I was excited. Good actors, cool story line, etc. Ends up it was very simplistic. It never made you think, I was never craving another episode, etc. The characters were clich√©' to the extreme and incredibly 1 dimensional. Another problem was the writers played off of the time period far more than they needed to. The time period was used as part of the ""product"" opposed to the reality that the story took place in. This left the story side weak. If you want to turn your brain off and watch mind numbing, boring TV that requires 3 brain cells this is the series for you."
5,Life on Mars: The Complete Series,"Shipping was fast as advertised. have not viewed the DVD yet, but the transaction was easy and I will buy again. Thanks"
3,Fun show.,"I am a fan of period shows and movies.I also like Gretchen Mol, and she was great in this show.Harvey Keitel was entertaining to watch. Jason O'Mara had a tough role, and sometimes seemed to play it over the top a bit. Nevertheless I liked the show.The weakest point on the DVD is the Menu graphics, it looks cheap and quickly thrown together."
3,It was okay.,Just updating my box sets collection. I loved this show and was sad to see it cancelled. I will watch the collection again one day.
5,Great Show,This is a great show which ran 2008-2009 season and based on a British show by the same name. I've watched both versions (I saw the American version first) and think they are both exceptional shows. It (US version) was cancelled too soon due to lack of vision by the network.
5,What was ABC thinking about?,"For those of us who have not been addicted to ""reality shows"", Life On Mars was a bright star in a dim sky. This show not only had an all-star cast, it had; originality, humor, suspense, and more. Also, as a ""boomer"" graduating high school in the early 70's this show hit the era - dead on! Although it only lasted on season, (Phooey on ABC), I now own teh series on dvd. I've already watched all 17 episodes...and I am certain I will be repeating that many more times over. I also suggest that you check out the BBC version from which this series is based. Last thought, Gretchen Mol is not only a great actress, she is a stunning woman!"
5,Pjsatinzoe,"This was one of my favorite t.v. shows which, unfortunately, lasted only one season. Loved the concept of a modern day (2000's) man finding himself back in the 1970's. Brought back alot of memories of that decade."
3,And where is the original pilot episode?,"I left a review over on Amazon.ca, so if you want my opinion of the show, it's right there.However, what I failed to mention is that this DVD doesn't include (as far as I can see) the original unshown pilot episode which is an interesting thing in itself. I would gladly pay my $30 for that alone. It still had Jason O'Mara as Sam Tyler, but none of the other actors in the eventual aired series appeared. Gene Hunt was played very ably by Colm Meaney (of Star Trek fame) but it failed to deliver and they completely rewrote the pilot, sacked everyone (except O'Mara) and started over.It's an interesting watch if you can find it though, as is this whole series. Just a shame about the ending which entirely ruins the whole previous 16/17 hours of the show."
5,Life Should Have Gone On,"It was a great intellectual and emotional delight to absorb this set.Everything was marvelous, inluding the:- Acting (wow you were right there in the episode)- The story (each show was stupendous) and great meta-story (fully fulfilled at the end)- The music (O, were the 70's that long ago?)This was my favorite series of 2008-2009 and it is in my top ten best time travel shows of all time.Too bad SyFy channel did not pick this up or Sarah Conner, or Eli Stone, or Jericho - can't SyFy buy anything???Watch it and fall into deep felicity."
3,And the Blu-Ray version is where?,"Let's see, great show (except the last 5 minutes), great acting, and great story. It was *produced* in high-definition, it was *broadcast* in high-definition, I *watched* it in high-definition, but the season's only available in standard-definition DVDs... good marketing, guys; you ensured that I won't buy it."
2,A great idea with all the sharp edges smoothed off,"I watched, and mostly enjoyed, the british original show a great deal. It had its faults, but its great strength was the unvarnished look of the past. This wasn't rosy nostalgia, there was a harsh veracity to it. The largest , of several , problems with the US remake was that it refused to do that. This was a cosy movie version of the early 70s in NY. It was all golden light and cute hippies, nostalgia minus the sleaze, the grime and the sense of truth.Also while I love Harvey Keitel, he was miscast. His shouty anger seemed curiously ineffectual, he seemed old. I'm afraid I couldn't make it to the end of the series, though I heard that they deviated from the original substantially and did take some risks. If only it had had the balls to do that at the start."
2,I hadn't seen Life On Mars before this week...,"Decided to give this set a try because it was inexpensive and had many positive reviews here...in retrospect, I think I should have gone with the original UK version.The writing and character development just never hooked me...there were a couple of good moments, and I did like the music, but overall found it a tough slog to get through, and the horribly contrived ""ending"" was the final straw for me.2 stars..."
5,"At Least they gave us the DVD set, Right on!","As a child of the 60's & 70's, I connected big time with Life on Mars; I wrote countless emails to ABC when I heard that they cancelled my favourite show and now we fans, will at least have the complete series on DVD, ( not many cancelled shows get on DVD>>>like The John Larroquette Show, & Hack & New York Undercover deserve )Did anyone besides me notice how much Michael Imperioli's Ray looked like Chuck Negron of Three Dog Night? Harvey Keitel nailed his boss man role;Jason O Mara played the confused, homesick, great cop very well. I loved the wardrobe, the music ( although there were great tunes from '73 that was left out i.e. Three Dog Night, The Rascals, The Beatles,) My son was born in 1973 as well, and this show gave him a chance to see how life was back in the day...SO happy to know it will be out for my birthday!!"
2,"""The Other Life on Mars""","I have to say that I have always checked out both British TV and the American remakes. Most of the time, they were pretty good. But in my opinion here, there should have only been the BBC version of this show. Other than the music, I found nothing to keep me watching thsi version. I am not sorry that I bought it, I was curious about the show. I never knew that a remake was made.The BBC version actors were more in tune with the emotions that should have been played out in the American version but missed by a mile.Actor John Simm conveys the emotions that probably would have hit all of us were we suddenly back in 1970. I know that I would freak...The second season of the British version of ""Life on Mars"" comes out next week, I can't wait to get my copy.I would not say don't see this. If you have not checkout the BBC version, you might like this. But please check out the BBC version, it will be an emotional ride you'll not forget."
4,Life on Mars. Life on Planet Imagine.,"Life on Mars. Yet another US version of a popular UK show which acquired wings of its own and flown away from the constraints of its british nest. And kudos to that. Although still faithfull and at times almost fac-similed plots, the US version has unique characteristics of its own. Casting Keitel and Imperioli's superb performances along a beautiful Gretchen Mol's presence set the series with a typical all American fantastic acting flavour. Not unlike the UK's version, this series is heavily dependant on a strong lead character, which finds O'Mara at a disadvantage here. On the technical side of things, Photography and Characterization, are flawless. The storyline is at first anemic but grows well if you let your imagination drive you. This is afterall a dream, or life in another Planet? Overall a good television series that has not survived the market test."
5,Fantastic Show,"I am sad that they had to prematurely end this series. It had everything--good writing, good acting, great music--and now it went away. At least we have the DVD coming. Thank goodness for small favors."
1,Not what it appears to be,"The sizes run extremely small. The size chart is not accurate and I was extremely disappointed with this item. Plus, the company does not allow for returns or exchanges if it is for size. So now I am stuck with a sweatshirt I cannot wear!!"
4,Great,Put it on my Toyota Highlander. It works great and looks good on my SVU. The aluminum finish gives it a more up-scale look compare to most black tubing rack. Very satisfy.
5,The way Calculus should be done,"I was a first year student at the University of Chicago when I first encountered this gem of a book. In the years since, I was forced to sell my copy, and regret it greatly.Spivak's book kept me up many a winter night struggling through his problem sets from hell. But alas, that is how math is done, not from reading brilliantly worded expositions or proofs, but actually mastering the thought process underlying proofs as well as the elegant structure of the calculus itself which Spivak brings forth.Think of it as unlearning everything you learned in AP Calculus and starting over from scratch, you won't even have to remember how to take a derivative or crunch an integral anymore....instead you'll find out the deeper story underlying it all."
5,WOW!,"Honestly, to state the value of this book in a few words, ""wow wow and WOW!"" This book, with its theoretical approach is far better than the usual monkey see monkey do- ""Calculus and Analysis"" books. Being a student in University I took a course which used one of those monkey see monkey books, and found them boring. I have heard so much about this book that I dropped that course and took a better First Year Calculus course that used SPIVAK's book. I love this book. It didn't matter that I wasted a year in a boring course, as long as I had this book to study!!!!!"
1,Can someone tell me who this book is for?,Is this for people who already know Calculus? My mind is blown after looking at this...I don't know what to say.If you want to learn calculus you should check out Morris Kline book.
1,Toil of deviant exhibition owing to deep trait(s) deficit...,"This book is unconditionally vouched for, provided the assembly is as, a matter of course and luck would have it, respectively, or conceivably in, in turn, camouflaged secret entanglement or incongruent relinquishment of immaterial ingenuity, suitably longing coverage in such desolations through accomplishment of, as liberation(s), claimed false conclusion(s) of nobility from residues or the class by claiming conception of Introductory Analysis.Moreover, in the pursuit of avoidance of inessential fuss, I have discerned and along would find detectable to suggest anabundantly more standard, supremely well and succinctly written useful text, in which things are accomplished the rightway, for real, in the way of existent or eventual, mathematicians. NamelyIntroduction to Analysis, by Maxwell Rosenlicht, (Dover); only $9.67 from Amazon!"
3,a book for morden analysis,"If you ask me, I think this book is better than the other for the same class. It involve the basic algebra but make you think deeper."
1,NOT good !!!!,This book only makes one's conception of calculus into a big confusion. Do not buy this book if you really don't feel like being frustrated.
3,compare to high school text book,"Material in this book is easier and narrower than high school text book; called ""right way of mathematics"" written by Hong, Sung Dae. I went to regular high school in South Korea."
1,this book sucks,"this book is so stupid. it doesn't make any sense. if anyone knows how to do the first problem, please let me know."
3,"it's good, but..","..as a sacrifice to his exposition, Spivak does away with chapter summaries, almost all worked examples, and also leaves a good portion of every chapter for the problems - leaving the reader in the dark as to what precisely he should know, and precisely why. (Though to his credit, EVERYTHING is proved!) Everyone loves Spivak because his is the un-math textbook: it's not at all hard to read, and isn't confusing or arid, and is even funny; now I'm all for a readable math textbook (which this definitely is), but not at the expense of clarity. In sum, Spivak's is the best text around for elementary analysis, but readers would do well to keep eg a copy of Stewart close at hand to tie things together."
4,A True Legend,"You really gotta love this guy. One of the true originals. When I was in college, I took a music appreciation course (you would think we would learn classical, that sort of thing) Wrong, our teacher taught us, among others, Glen Campbell. It just doesn't get any better than ""Wichita Lineman."" What a song!This CD is Great! Okay, all your cool friends may make fun of you but I bet you'll listen secretly behind closed doors. Old favorites include ""Gentle on My Mind"" and ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix"" but who would think Glen could perform one of the most beautiful renditions of ""Amazing Grace"" you'll ever hear?The majority of the songs are so good you can even forgive him for ""Rhinestone Cowboy"" and ""Southern Nights."" No one said Glen couldn't be hokey.Buy this CD today and play it for all your friends. Let's turn on a new generation to the wonder that is Glen Campbell."
5,"To make color last a long time, buy this shampoo.","Since I have been coloring the gray in my hair, I have tried several shampoos that state that they are for colored hair; they didn't keep my color as long as I had hoped. I then tried Redken Color Extend; it really makes the color last alot longer than any of the others. That also helps save money by not having to get it colored as often. I will stick with this shampoo as long as I color my gray and as long as Redken makes it."
4,Practical advice served with great humor.,"This book is very user-friendly, offering common sense psychology sprinkled with great humor. I stumbled across Ms. Price's book through the good advice of a friend and was captivated by her insights. Don't be put off by the innocuous title; the author's voice is unique. She mixes literary and therapist voices with an entertaining writing style. Hope you enjoy this book as much as I did."
4,Synopis:,"When Jillian goes to see an act of slappy's, She see's a fight between the ventriloquist and him. Mysteriously she got a package with slappy inside. Now she has to deal with problems Slappy may of not made..."
3,Bride of the Living Dummy,"Bride of the Living Dummy is about a girl named Jillian and her sisters, Katie and Amanda. Katie and Amanda have a doll named Mary- Ellen, and they talk to that doll as if the doll were alive. In the morning, the girls try to give Jillian a haircut, because they say that Mary-Ellen said that she needed a haircut for insulting Mary-Ellen the night before. Afterwards, Jillian is supposed to take her sisters to a ventriloquist show at the Saturday matinee. There they meet Slappy, and when Slappy finds his way to the Zinman residence, all sorts of things start to happen. Such things indicate that Slappy wants his bride. Overall, a well written book."
5,bride of the living dummy,amazon did an awsome job when it comes to used books. a few days ago i bought used book from bride of the living dummy. to tell u the truth i thought they would rip me off but i have too say well done amazon well done. i love goosebumps my faveorite books ever
5,A Spine Chilling Book,I loved it If you like scary suprises you should read it. Jillan's little sisters have a doll that makes them be there slaves. The doll falls in love with a dummie named Slappy. Makes him come a live and do all sorts of goss and scary tricks. And him and her end up in pieces. It was great!
5,It's a match made in horror!,"Jillian hates her sisters Katie and Amanda. One day while going to the show, Harrison got Slappy because Jimmy O' James did not need him anyway. troubles started at THE ZINMAN FAMILY. First, when they ere asked to go to the party one of their tricks became dangerous and injuried two kids. Next, Jillian's lizard was missing. And last, The birthday of Eddie Simkin. The trouble was they brought Slappy too. Then, he spitted some bad green ooze. Slappy said that his bride Jillian!. WRONG. BECAUSE SLAPPY'S BRIDE IS MARY ELLEN. Mary ellen is Katie and amanda's doll. So order this book now!!!!. Forgot one more thing. When they were in a mansion, they saw a diary of Jimmy and it is about Slappy. It is said that the toymaker who made Slappy is evil."
5,How to Recognize a Four-Footed Guru,"""Unleashing Your Inner Dog"" is a wonderful blend of prose and illustration. Mari Gayatri-Stein has the rare distinction of being both a literary and a visual artist, and both talents drew me delightfully through the book. The writing is lyrical without being precious, authentic without being confessional. The cartoons are wry and kind - the best combination for such illustrations, and a difficult balance to attain. ""Inner Dog"" is one of those handy books you can read in manageable bites. I looked forward every evening to sliding into bed and reading for five or ten minutes, then falling asleep in the kind of good mood only a dog can inspire. Whether you want to treat yourself to a little gem or give a welcome gift, I recommend this book unreservedly."
5,Perfect for DIY electric brewing,"I used the 44-Quart version to make a BIAB electric brewery. It's great!The included basket is very close to a 5 gallon bucket, making it perfect for lining with a strainer bag for the grain.The diameter of the vessel also makes marking a sight gauge excessively easy. Each 1 cm corresponds basically perfectly to 1 quart of water (w/in the bounds of thermal expansion so as accurate as possible). I poured in 3 gallons and marked it then 6 gallons and marked again to get a couple known frames of reference and worked from those."
4,Ferry Cross the Mersey,This is a talented band singing great covers of many great hits. There are even two religious songs which are really good too. Way to go--Gerry and the Pacemakers!
1,Sad,"I feel ripped off. It is NOT ""The Best of Gerry and the Pacemakers. It is a collection of covers. Make sure you look at the list.You'll Never Walk AloneA Whiter Shade of PaleIfHouse of the Rising SunAnd more music you never heard these guys sing."
5,I am a Maria Callas fan,"Since the first reviewer wanted a Callas point of view on this Tape I will give my honest opinion. First and foremost I am a diehard Callas fan. I believe that Callas had the best vocal technique and dramatic intelligence that not even Caballe or Tebaldi could ever dream of having even in her later years. Yet, she never possesed the lovely lyric voice that Joan Sutherland had. Her agility soars well above any I have ever heard of or will ever hear of again. Her e flat come out of her like hit a key on a piano yes that simple. She will go down in history as the best voice of the 20th century. My highest recommendation for this Tape."
1,THIS IS A LOUD TOY,"My son asked for an ambulance for Christmas so naturally, I added this to my order. I tried it out before I wrapped it -- it plays loud LOUD music and has obnoxious lights. It's exactly what it says it was, I just didn't expect the music."
5,Amelia will haunt you.,"Portland is a beautiful city, but at a cost. Rain falls there 10 months out of the year, keeping the entire city alive with green under a cloudy overcast. Amelia, yet another wonderful band from this city, has a sound which doesn't deny its Portland roots. Many of the songs on this album share the same kind of somber beauty of its city. Teisha's low voice seems to glide over the songs like raindrops over fallen leaves. Each song on this album has its own personality, with guest musicians playing instruments ranging from the accordian to the glockenspiel. But, all will haunt you with a spirited sadness that could come only from the Pacific NW."
4,flawed master,"Another exquisite collection from the Grimethorpe Colliery Band, but appears to have been cut from a flawed master. My first copy was a gift from a friend in the U.K., and the final track produced sharp crackley sounds like a deeply scratched vinyl disc, so I ordered another from Amazon plus a second one for a friend. Both have the same flawed final cut, but I've not returned them because it is so good that I'd rather have it flawed than not at all."
2,Church hymns in the Salvation Army Band style,Most of the songs on this album sound as if they were arranged from the song books found on the back of a church pew. Nothing too original - or that exciting about them.If you need old timey church music... this is it.
2,Nice selections - dissappointing sound quality,"This is one of the UK's top brass bands performing tastefully arranged hymn tunes. Featured in the movie ""Brassed Off!"" I expected great things from this CD. My main disappointment is the sound quality, or lack thereof. I have vintage cassette tapes which sound considerably better. The performances are mostly excellent, but I fear not enough to overcome the poor sound."
4,African Film Review,Useful companion to selected African films and a model for future books in this underrepresented area. African films are enjoying more visibility due to better distribution worldwide.
3,Very informative if you are interested in the workings of the peerage,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It offers some great information regarding peerage and the evolution of the nobility in Britain. I would have rated this book much higher, but found it to be a little tedious to read."
5,Excellent reference book,Covers the great works extremely well. Breaks the characters and stories down very well. Fells as if you have read the great works themselves. Much like an advanced Cliff Notes.
4,Great kids book!,This is great story with rhyming sing-song text that keeps even young readers/listeners interested. Good for all ages
5,great,buy another day in paradise and read itthen buy steel toes and read itjust do it you wont regret it
3,a great voice,"Ivor Emmanuel first came to my attention in the film ZULU. I have collected several versions of the song, Men of Harlech but none stands out as much as the original version during the movie and the stirring version at the end of the film. I purchased this cd mainly just for the song, Men of Harlech. It is a great version and well worth the price. As for the other selections on this cd, There are only two or three that I like, the rest just isn't my type of music. It is a shame this fine singer hasn't recorded other songs to be made available for purchase."
2,Marvelous Production MURDERED by a Nitwit,"Remember this name: Ross MacGibbon. If you see it attached, as director, to ANYTHING, run.Why?Okay, picture this: A brilliantly staged/choreographed acrobatic ballet featuring fantastic dancers and actors.Now, imagine filming this ballet AND FILMING MOST OF IT IN CLOSE-UPS OF THE PERFORMERS FACES!!!!!!!!!!!Idiotic, no?Idiotic, YES!And the person who performed this Entertainment Lobotomy on the delightful National Theatre's 30 minute (not quite ballet, but near enough) adaptation of the Seuss masterpiece is the afore mentioned Mr. MacGibbon.It's sad, really. Because, what one CAN see of the production leads one to believe it could have been superb home entertainment."
5,Great mattress! Amazon's service is even better!,"Let me begin with the service - Amazon never disappoints! I placed my order on SAT afternoon, the mattress was delivered the following TUE morning. And this is with FREE super saver shipping option!!! The product is great too. Packaging was in a perfect condition (not that it really matters to me). The mattress is very light what will make sheet changing a piece of cake of a job. It fits the EU brand crib very tight and no extra space is left in the corners. It is quite hard (what all the pediatricians recommend) and has no bumps, folds, etc. Our baby is not due for another 4 weeks, so I cannot comment whether she likes sleeping on it or not, but so far, we as parents-to-be are VERY satisfied!"
4,Nice Crib Mattress,This crib mattress is pretty firm. It fit perfectly in our standard-size crib. I can't wait to let baby sleep on it and see how she likes it.
2,hard,"We have a colgate foam mattress for our oldest daughter that we got at buy buy baby, we love it. Then to save some money I found this one on amazon. And I'm really bummed out about it. Our one from buy buy baby is two sided, one side is for NB's then you flip it when the baby is 1 years old for a softer mattress. So when I ordered this one I thought it would be just like that. But its SO hard and its not double sided. We're using it for now, but I'm going to have to get something different our 4 month old just tosses all night in it, I feel like shes sleeping on concrete!"
1,"beyond firm, this mattress is HARD","Being a first time mom and reading way too many books and articles insisting my baby needs a firm mattress... I searched for the perfect one. I read the reviews and thought, how hard could a mattress be? let me tell you. this mattress doesn't have any give at all. It's way too hard. My son won't sleep on it and no mattress pad is soft or safe enough. The plastic doesn't breathe at all either, my son frequently wakes up all sweaty. I don't recommend this mattress and I'm looking to buy a new one myself. Probably an organic cotton mattress."
1,Way Too Firm!,"We received this mattress from craigslist to go with the crib the owner was selling. My son's other crib broke during a move. The mattress that came with the crib from craigslist had already gone through 3 kids from the previous owner. I don't know if I could believe that because it was in it's original box, opened and looked like brand new. This mattress was as hard as sleeping on a floor with no give at all! My son who is 20 months old tried stomping on it to soften it up. We started laughing when he did that and he was getting frustrated because it had no give. He usually sleeps 12 hours with a 2 to 3 hour nap. He cried the whole time during his nap on this mattress and would not sleep. He also did not sleep the whole night. He kept waking up. We decided to buy another mattress, a Sealy one and he is finally sleeping good again and looks comfortable. I felt bad that he even slept on the other one. That must have been torture."
3,HARD,"There's firm, but then there's *FIRM*. This matress is like a rock, and my baby has not sleep well in it. Trust me, I tried. ....at least until I added quite a bit of padding. We started out with a bassinet, then moved to crib. I suppose every baby is different though.There isn't a standard definaition of ""extra firm"" crib matresses. I've felt other extra firm matresses that weren't nearly this hard.Give this matress a shot, but do *keep the box* just in case your baby doesn't like it. I want to return it but need a darn box now."
5,Light and Durable and Firm,Easy to change sheets. Fits very tight in my crib. I really hate spring mattresses so this is a nice alternative.
3,"Safe, But Hard","I'm pleased with the safety of this mattress--it is very firm, and it eases my worries about SIDS. However, now that my little girl is almost 11-months old, and not sleeping very well at night, I wonder if I should have gotten a softer mattress. We just came back from spending the holidays at a relatives' house, and my daughter slept on a softer mattress there, and she woke up much less during our one-week stay (only once most night, versus two or three wake-ups at home). I'm now thinking of buying a different mattress--one that is a little bit softer. I think Colgate also makes a mattress that can be flipped to a softer/toddler side. Wish I had gotten that one."
3,A little too firm,"This mattress is very firm. Like sleeping on a board, firm. Our baby has never slept very well and at 7 months we decided to try out a new softer but still firm mattress (Sealy Baby Firm Rest Crib Mattress) and our baby falls asleep now almost immediately and sleeps much longer at a time."
2,"Too firm, Baby won't sleep.","I, like many others, bought this because of all the rave reviews and because it is rated the safest in regards to SIDS. Our Baby will sleep anywhere but on this mattress. If she is sleeping on the mattress, she will only sleep in 30 minute intervals. And since she began sitting up on her own, and then pulling up, she does not fall back to sleep easily. I would have returned the mattress but we got it a couple of months before I delivered, and she slept in a cradle for the first few months. It looks brand new, because it basically is, and I still have the box.Now I'm stuck with a co-sleeper because I could not get her to successfully sleep in her crib, even when it was in the room with me. We don't even use it for naps."
2,too hard,I got the mattress because of all the great reviews (especially concerning SIDS risk) but my 6 month old has not had one good night in the crib. I think I'll try getting a thick mattress pad or another softer mattress.
2,This mattress is Sooooo hard,"We purchased this mattress 5 years ago for DD because it was touted as the best. I feared SIDS so wanted to get a firm mattress. However my DD NEVER slept through the night. She had reflux so we thought it was her. When she got older we added mattress pads to make it softer, but not until she was in a real bed did she sleep through the night.Now we pulled it out for DS. He is much more happy go lucky and will sleep ANYWHERE except the crib. The couch, my bed, the rocker, car seat, the carpet- ANYWHERE. I've tried everything to make this mattress a little more comfortable, but it really is just rock hard. I truthfully hate this mattress and wish I had purchased something a little more comfortable.After 6 months of no sleep we are off to find another mattress with some more comfort, but still safe for DS."
2,Hard as a Rock-way beyond what is necessary!,"My daughter was an excellent sleeper when she was in her cradle...then we moved her onto this mattress in her crib. She slept terribly. She would fall asleep but she would continually wake up. After a few months I got a new mattress and she slept all night long. This mattress is the closest thing to concrete that there is. A firm mattress does not mean that the child has to sleep on rocks. I am very concerned about SIDS and researched high and low. I ended up with a much more expensive mattress that is firm yet not like concrete and it is highly recommended.The only positive thing I can say about this mattress is that because it is foam it is very easy to change sheets etc., but all foam mattresses are like that.Edit to above: As per comments...the mattress that we replaced this on with was the moonlight slumber mattress."
2,Buy an organic mattress instead,"Even though this is a good mattress, a word of caution: it contains several artificial and possibly toxic chemicals. I used it for 2 years for my baby and regretted not buying an organic mattress (such as Naturepedic) instead. They've done studies recently that artificial flame retardants are not good for children's health. I wish I knew this earlier and had paid the extra $300 or so for the organic mattress. Anything for our baby's health."
1,DOES NOT FIT OUR CRIB!,"WARNING - Does not fit Baby Mod cribs!! If you are purchasing this mattress to go with the Baby Mod crib, it will not work. Our cribs frame is rounded and will only hold a rounded mattress. I did not realize crib mattresses were not universal. Apparently the baby mod cribs/ or this mattress is not. It has to be returned because of its square corners. I could try stuffing it down in there, but I think it would eventually rip the mattress when trying to change the sheets. What a disappointment!"
3,Good rating from consumer reports,We are expecting twin girls and bought two mattresses for their two cribs. They have not arrived yet but they seem like they will be comfortable and easy to clean!
4,Good For The Baby - Bad For The Wallet,I think my grandson sleeps comfortably on this mattress and that's what matters the most. But the price - AY CARAMBA!
2,Hard as a rock!,"If you want an EXTRA FIRM mattress for your little one, look no further! The poor child might as well sleep on the concrete! I did give it two stars because it does seem to be very well made. BUT I will be returning this mattress!"
5,Very High Quality Infant Mattress,"Colgate has been making the highest quality infant mattresses for over 50yrs, and being an Atlanta native, we knew we would not even look at another brand of mattress for our baby!! We are expecting our first in May and just got our ortho foam mattress. It has the perfect amount of firmness and it is breathable. It fits snugly inside our Baby's Dream Serenity crib and I love how lightweight it is for all those late night sheet changes!! It is also waterproof and easy to clean with just a damp cloth. We are excited about this mattress and fully trust in the quality that Colgate produces."
5,Great Mattress,"I had this mattress for my first child and now will be using it for my second child. It still looks and feels brand new. It has great support, still firm, and is easy to clean. The original $100 investment was worth it!"
5,Excellent mattress,My husband and I did a lot of research and decided this was definitely the mattress to buy and we have been very happy with it! Colgate makes a quality product and is certainly a reputable company in the baby-gear world.
4,"Love it, but it is really hard.","This mattress is light, and easy to get in and out of the crib. It is easy to clean. No need for a mattress cover. It is really hard though. That was part of the reason I bought it. I knew that a baby is supposed to have firm mattress, but this this is like sleeping on the floor. In hindsight she could have slept on something a little softer."
4,Nice and firm mattress,I've been using this for a few weeks now and i think the baby likes it!It's a little expensive but is firm and helps the baby to fall sleep without me worrying about his posture.I'm really hoping it lasts long enough to justify the high price.
5,Just What We Needed!,"The Colgate Classica I is a perfect fit in our Jenny Lind crib. It's definitely firm, but baby mattresses are supposed to be firm! Our little guy has slept well on it since he started sleeping in his crib. It's super lightweight, and all of our crib sheets (all from Meijer!) have fit easily."
5,Great Mattress,"I bought this mattress for my first child after my wife saw the high recommendation in the Baby Bargains Book. This was a great recommendation and a great purchase. If my daughter could speak, she would say ""I love this mattress!"" We plan on using the same brand for our next child. We also have the baby changing pad from Colgate and that works great as well. We use it on top of the dresser because we did not purchase a baby changing station."
2,Good Luck,"As I beginner I was anxious to read and do everything in this book from front to back. She's obviously a skilled craftsperson and her jigs are well built and thought out. I however became discourged quickly with the complexity of them. I found that the materials she suggests for the projects are hard to find, ie, baltic birch plywood, acrylic over 1/4"", HDPE plastic,veneer screws, and adhesive backed sandpaper. My local hardware stores and lumber yards did not have these materials. Wait until you see the vacuum clamping system she recommends! If you enjoy scavenger hunts this book is for you.If you start by building ""her"" router table the jigs work better, but I already have a nice router table and don't care to make the invasive modifications she recommends when other plans and jigs are available elsewhere that adapt well to what I have.Of couse if some of the jigs and parts are too difficult for you, you can find them prebuilt and available for a price at her own website!"
3,Not Correct,"The author eschews using template bushings in her router work, saying that the math is too complicated. On pg. 81, fig. 1, the book has a formula for making a gauge in order to set a fence to route a rabbet. The formula is not correct, so you have to derive the formula on your own; so go figure. If you are a beginner, it would be better to look at the router tutorials on RouterForums dot Com. After you have acquired a solid base of knowledge, then look at this book for some new ideas."
4,Router & Joinery,Great book especially for someone like myself who is just learning routing. Lots of instructions and plenty of pictures for detailed information.
5,Outstanding,"This book is a pleasure to work with - the set ups are practical and the instructions are clear. Furthermore it has inspired other woodworkers to post to the net variations, improvements and simplifications of the original methods and jigs.Definitely one of the best books on the subject."
1,not good,"This product never got to my home. They sure refound my money back, but I was never able to see the real stuff, because they made a mistake in the address."
3,"""Bad Boys"" Miami Takedown Review","I was able to pick this up at an amazingly low price for a new release and I've got to say it was easily worth the price. This Playstation 2 shoot-em up is based on the ""Bad Boys"" movies starring Martin Lawrence and Will Smith as wise-crackin' narcortics cops. The game follows a similiar theme as the films with partners Mike Lowry and Marcus Bernett hunting down Russian gangsters while trading bad jokes. The game play is somewhat similar to the ""Time Crisis"" arcade games and is surprisingly addictive after a couple tries. The game's only big downfall is the horrible voice actors who sound nothing like their big screen counterparts. At some points, they actually sound like Southern biggots trying to do mock impressions of Black people. I kid you not. Other than the awful voices, the game is a lot of fun and I recommend to any fan of the ""Bad Boys"" movies."
3,Take Down,ok 1st off this game is so easy. i beat it on hard in 2 hrs of non stop playin so if u like a quick game stang u a copy i got myne real cheap.. its ok not the best
1,The Worst Game Ever made on any system EVER!,"I find it hard to belive that someone actually made this game, and if that wasn't bad enough, some guy actually tried to sell it.There should be a group formed right away dedicated to gathering up ever copy oth this game and then placing them in a big pile. After this they should be crushed blown up, and the ashes should be flown into space.Seriously, I have played video games for every system ever made for the last 30 years. This is the absolute worst game ever. I almost can't belive that it exists....."
1,Waste of Time,This book is very poorly writen. I thought it would be a book I could use on a trip to Prague. Way too much detail and writen like a term paper might be (and if I was to grade the paper I would give it a D).
3,"Informative in Parts, But a Bit Dense","As with some of the other reviewers, I am glad I read this AFTER I visited Prague. It is best not read cover to cover, but use the index to read about the things you want to learn more about. Otherwise, you will be overwhelmed by personal names and places in a language most of us are unaccustomed to. Don't lie to me & tell me you will remember it all! (smile). (Unless you are an expert in Slavic languages)."
2,Pretentious history,"To write a history text which is so broad in definition but so inaccessible to the casual reader makes this a pretentious read. As a historian, there is much that is up for debate in his first three chapters - and that is not always clear. And some of his points, (eg. that the root of Slav is from the word ""sklavenoi"", meaning slave) has long been out of vogue among Slavic historians. Parts are fun to read, but I believe the greatness of the text is hyperbolic."
5,Pure Gold,"Evocative and mesmerizing. This is for lovers of history who may be lightly informed on the Austro-Hungarian empire and its role in world events, especially the two World Wars. Be sure to have maps with you as you read this delightful book."
5,Beautiful China,"This film is a six-episode documentary on the flora and fauna of China, with occasional intercessions of human activities, all in high definition. The viewers are treated with incredible sight and sound of natural China, as well as the lifestyle of local people in various parts of the country. It is beautiful. In one scene, a Rickett's big-footed bat was filmed with a high-speed camera catching fish in the dark. The sequence is a work of art. Do not miss out on this gem, nature lovers."
4,One part of an fascinating whole,"Well balance, polite, very well filmed and enormously entertaining look at one of the multifaceted places that is China. Would have liked a little more social historical context. Strongly recommended as it is a thought provoking and beautiful documentary."
4,Wild China,Wonderful visual. Would have been perfect if the background music were softer. Too difficult to hear the narrator. Someone should have noticed this.
5,Wild China,"Excellent, breathtaking beauty. I will be watching this dvd many times. It's a great way to experience some peace in these trying times."
5,wonderful glimpse f China,Our whole family 7 years to 45 years enjoyed watching this DVD. It shows the geographic diversity and beauty of China that most of us have never seen.
1,Never received the item,"The delivery estimate was Friday April 20, 2012 but I have not received this item yet. Could you, please, check what happened? I am reporting this complaint under ""Create a Review"" because I did'n find any place to report a non received item in your web page."
4,"Good, but can be better in 1080p","This documentary is great. However, the highest resolution is 1080i. I wish to see this in FULL-HD 1080p."
5,great job,one of the best doc that I have ever seen ... China is a wonderful place ..BBC made unbelievable effort in this show
4,Definitely Top 90%,"This documentary was one of the better ones that I've seen. I'd put it in the same category of Planet Earth, Life, and Frozen Planet. Though I'm a David Attenborough fan I still thought the narrator was decent. Who knew that China was so awesome..granted that they make probably 90% of the worlds fake items this is all real with some awesome shots and informative documentation that doesn't put you to sleep but instead makes you want to stay up beyond reasonable hours.I'd highly recommend this documentary along with Life, Planet Earth, and Frozen Planet. =] Enjoy, and if you don't I don't care because I've enjoyed it and I will for times to come."
5,Gorgeous,"They did a great job. I didn't expect to like this better than Planet Earth, but I did. CCTV has interviewed the Chinese filmmaker involved with this BBC production at least twice. This was presented in a way that was more interesting and stylish than previous nature documentaries from China."
5,The other side of China,"This DVD set shows the other side of China, a spectacular shots of nature enclosed within the Chinese borders. Each segment shows magnificent photography of people living with their environment, not just recently, but for centuries. So what if BBC painted China with sugarcoated lenses! The amazing sceneries were still amazing! You'll see places and aerial views that will leave you breathless. There are 2 disks in the set - 6 episodes in all. The 2nd disk contains a bonus feature where they show you how they filmed those amazing shots. The music was beautiful and complements the series. My only complaint about this set is that I had to choose ""no subtitle"" every time I watch the DVD. Other than that, I'm very pleased with my purchase. Highly, highly recommended!"
4,Abridged Christmas Carol Coloring Book,The detailed illustrations were a big help in giving my 7th grade LD students and MH students some visual clues they could use in comprehension and context evaluations. Several of these students could not read but could use these coloring guides to follow the story at a very elementary level. This book also helped my students identify the diffent clothing of the period and the architecture. It is wonderful and these are additional copies to my collection my others are so old they needed updating. Thank you so so much for making access to this book so easy. K.Wood
2,Odd Coloring Book,"This is a story book with a small picture on some pages to color. I expected a coloring book, not a book. It is so hard to find coloring books with nice pictures, as some adults like to color. Anyway, If anyone wants strictly pages to color, this is not like that.."
3,Good Value,"This is a sturdy product. It's nothing too fancy but if you need a basic thermometer, this is it. I would reccomend."
2,Mislead by a good deal to good to be true.,"They ought've mentioned this entire album is LIVE. Fine performances, great set list, but if live is not your thing, then this is not for you. I feel slightly tricked--nowhere does it mention the actual title: ""The Best of Johnny Cash, In Concert."""
3,A triple whammy,"Garrett and his partner the Dead Man go from famine to a plethora of cases in this novel. Garrett only has to follow one of the local soapbox conspiracy orators after he is released from prison, find a green butterfly belching serial killer and find the wayward daughter of the boss of the underworld. He accomplishes this in his usual way, and manages to rescue 3 damsels in distress along the way. Of course things do get a little interesting after the serial killer dies, and still keeps on killing. But that is almost par for the couse in TunFaire a real melting pot for all sorts from this fantasy world.I enjoyed reading this even though at times, I felt that Cook was flat out telling the reader the solution prior to his character's enlightenment. This did not lessen the enjoyment any. And Cook still managed to get enough in to set up for his next book. I would definitely reccomend this one if you like Same Spade style mysteries and fantasy."
2,Dissapointed,"I had two choices for the notebook backpack (between this and Burton the white collection). I should have bought the Burton.This notebook is really looked cheap especially the inside part. The color doesn't look like the color from the picture provided by Amazon. I saw a lot of refurbished for sale, I'm worry about the quality. Should keep the warranty info.Do not buy! I am Sony fans, but this product blew me up.See picture I posted for detail"
1,waste of your time,This book is a waste of your time. It is totally islamophobic and bias. This book is a waste of your time instead read Islam Today: A Short Introduction to the Muslim Worldby Akbar S. Ahmed if you want book you can actually learn something from
1,A very short collection of hearsay,"I recently purchased this booklet, and by the end I realized that I learned nothing about the Koran. This booklet is simply a small collection of every rumor and weak story said about the Koran. It glimpses over the important subjects that someone reading an introduction might be looking for. Waste of money, a simple google search about the Koran will give you much more sound info."
5,very good introduction to quran/koran,This is a good history and a high level overview of the Quran. Author brings academic and historical context to the Quran. Readers looking to prove or disprove the authenticity of the holy book will be disappointed. Those looking for a scholarly perpective will enjoy it.
5,Good Stuff,I've tried alot of different brands of glutamine and this is one of the best. It is 100% micronized and is completely flavorless. And you get 325 servings or 1600g as opposed to the 1000g most companies have.
2,Richard Caruso Hairsetter,"I've had a similar one to this many years ago. My disappointment was the foam on the curlers were awful-actually crumbling off the plastic before I'd even used it. When I called the company I was told they would replace them, but first I had to mail the original ones back to them. That means waiting for replacements, and no hair curlers in the meantime. Plus the cost to me of returning them. Not what I had expected."
5,Excellent Work,"This was an excellent book - One of the best i've read to date from the DragonLance series, and i've been an avid reader for about 8 years. The story was very well told, very interesting, and the first few chapters really drew my interest. So much, in fact, that I read the entire book in one sitting. The book relates the story of Vinas Solamnus, who, while a relatively important figure in the DragonLance series, was barely touched upon until now. I'd recommend this tale to any experienced DragonLance reader."
5,One of the best dragonlance books.,I decided to buy this book only because it was a dragonlance. I was pleasantly surprised how good it was. Vinas starts out as a fighter for good. His old man dies so he becomes evil. After years of fighting for the evil empire of Ergoth he becomes a rebel and fights for good again. The only mention of the knights of Solamnia is on the very last page. I didn't care though. The battle scenes in this book were detailed and fast paced. A definite buy.
4,Awesome,"I really loved this book. For most of the story Vinas is rather evil, and then he changes. It was cool to know that even the legendary founder of the Solamnic Knoghts wasn't a perfect person. I did think it should have included more about the forming of the Knighthood, though. It would have been better longer."
2,Pitiful,"I bought this book as soon as I saw it on the shelf, figuring it would explain how the Knights of Solamnia got started. Wrong! The book focuses on his (Vinas') life, not the Knights. If you ever wondered what the story of Vinas was, keep on wondering. It's better that way. If you are really interested in the Knights of Solamnia, buy the Legend of Huma( it's a 5 star book)."
3,Vinas Solamnus,"It's me again. Okay, well, this was a pretty good book, but I've still read better. It got boring after a while, but then it got better. It had a kind of dissapointing ending, but it was still pretty good. It was the second book that I read in the Dragonlance series, and I'm working on my third now. I'd give it three stars because even though it was good, there are still some better ones out there."
2,Vinus Solamnus and his climb up the career ladder,I didn't think that this book delt with the founding of the knights. It felt more like some ambitious guy having a serious mood swing at the last few pages. The oath and the measure seem to have a lot of thought behind them yet this book doesn't even come close to showing their birth. Vinus Solamnus according to this book would not even come close to getting into his own Knighthood.
4,"A well-written, if somewhat misguided book","Several of the reviews you'll see for this novel talk about how they wish it talked about the Knights of Solamnia. Although it doesn't, it does talk about the early life of their founder. In my opinion, it's well worth the money."
5,Zoo Review Fun!,"These felt sets are fun for creative play! Even our two year old grandson has become entranced by the possibilities.We have purchased a few others also. Service was fairly quick, so all in all, we are delighted with purchase!"
4,i like!,"This nightstand looks great in my bedroom. It wasn't too hard to put together (and I HATE putting together furniture), but it was pretty staightforward and worth it. It's mostly composite wood, so looks a little cheap if you're really staring at it, and probably wont last for an exceptionally long time. But it was quite inexpensive, so it works for me! It did seem like it took an awfully long time to arrive, but it at least nothing was broken or damaged."
5,Engineering Mouse,"This is my mouse of choice for use with all our engineering software and documentation software; solid, ""no skip"" action, light and smooth."
4,Panda Grey is Nearly Black!,"Shoppers beware, the Amazon colors shown on your monitor are way off on these mats. I ordered Panda Grey and it's actually a very dark charcoal, nearly black. Otherwise, quality is nice."
5,Awesome Michael vick Hat,I ordered this hat for my son who is a large Michael Vick Fan. He loves it. He hardly takes it off to sleep and bath.The quality of the stitching is excellent.
4,Nice for the price,"I am using this for my children's CD-ROM games. It also holds DVD cases nicely. My children 3, 5 and 7 tend not to put the discs back when they are done with them or can't find the games that they want to play. This storage container makes the discs easy to find and to clean up. It is also sturdy and much nicer in appearance than some other storage solutions. I can leave them on the shelf were it keeps things orderly while looking good."
2,Looking to translate from Arabic in Iraq,"For Arabic words the dictionary uses a romanized new alphabet instead of Arabic. Consequently it is impossible to look up Arabic words that appear in newspaper articles,on food or in everyday situations. Conversely it is not possible to write the Arabic word for an English word without deciphering/translating the authors' new alphabet for the Arabic alphabet."
4,One of the best in '04,"Vast Aire has a different style then most other MCs out today. And the way that he flows combined with the beats makes this a great album. Songs like ""Zenith"" w/ Blueprint and ""Posse Slash"" w/ Karniege, Breez Evahflowin, Poison Pen & Aesop Rock really make this a one of a kind album. Other artists include S.A. Smash, MF Doom, Sadat X, Breezely Brewin, and Vordul of Cannibal Ox. Production wise this CD falls a little short in some songs, BUT the other songs make up for the weaker ones trust me. This CD probably has about 3 weak songs, the rest are all excellent and replayable. Overall I am glad I picked up this CD and it is recommended to people who like Def. Jux, Weathermen, or any earlier Eastern Conference releases."
3,Good at best first solo album,This album is a good showing from one of the most creative MC's to date. Conspiracies soar about another Cannibal Ox album but I would like to see a solo album from Can Ox #2 Vordul. Standout track is #2. Lots of filler on this album.
4,Its a dent,"With a couple of El-P tracks this would be a 5 star album. The SA Smash guest spot is typically brainless primordial but Vast still kills the track. I didn't mind the hooks since half of them still remained in Vast's abstract non-sequitir world. Production is tight all around and it was good to hear VA and Vordul on a song again. Can't wait for the next Can Ox, but this makes things easier."
2,Vast-Flat*,"Disappointment after Cold Vein. The message and the music seemed disconnected and makes it impossible to flow. Vast Aire being an underground artist should understand that this genre is dependent on flow not just a flowing rap style but Flo...check out C-Ray Waltz, Ravipops, track Flo. I expected a much more substance in the lyrics and relevence to our plight are undergrounders."
5,Vast is sick!!!!,"One half of the the underground group Canibal OX, Vast Aire brings his solo LP to the masses...and he doesn't dissapoint. It;s not like Cold Vein but it is all VAST. The stand out cuts in my opinion is the title track, Look Mom...No Hands, KRS-Lightly, Pegasus, Elixir feat my man Sadat X, 9 Lashes where Vast disses another underground group...7L and Esoteric, Viewtiful Flow, and Da Superfriendz feat. MF Doom!!! Vast voice, cadence and flow is tight!! Everything blends and he has some great wordplay. If you are into lyrics this LP is for you to check out. The beats are good, the best one is Elixir by Ayatollah HOT!! Once again, straight up New York hip-hop!!!"
4,4.5 starz for Vaste,"Cmon guys u cant go around expecting an equal of cannibal ox on this cd. This cd is underrated cuz its always compared to The Cold Vein when its really pretty cool, Vaste Aire is one of my favorite rappers becuz his always bustin out wit new ideas fo his rhymes and his flow is real cool. I reccomend this to any fan of Vaste Aire if u can find it and get is it easy."
3,ambulance needs more for the price,The ambulance is good and attractive but my 5 yr old son lost interest a bit over time as the siren is not loud enough and it does not go automatically like his fire engine does.need more for the price I paid.
3,The British blu ray works fine on U.S. players...,"I know, I bought one from AmazomUK. Interesting low budget film, which I enjoyed very much. My only complaint was that there are no subtitles for the English portion of the dialog. Shop around for the best price. The bookResistanceis worth a read also."
5,even a child can fall in love with this book,"im only 14 yrs old, and emediatly fell in love with this book when i began to read my little sisters teachers copy. i love the ideas about the playhouse made from sunflowers (which i am allowed to make next spring) and the notes about fairies and the flowers. i believe in fairies and im going to buy some of the flowers they say fairies use for hats and plates etc. for my ever growing fairies house. i love flowers and a wild garden with exotic colours and feelings. i garden is the key to happiness and tranquility. this is a marvelous book that anyone could learn to love and cherish forever and ever. thank you."
1,Not Good,"Do not buy these as a low carb substitute for chips. 1st of all these soy crisps contain RICE, which is not good at all. 2nd, and most importantly, they taste TERRIBLE. I disagree with the reviewer that said they taste like Bugles. Do not buy this product."
3,I think it's broken...,"It fell from the 5.8 Virginia Earthquake hours ago. When the Earthquake happened, The remote just fell. I think it broke b/c of that. Fell very hard. Hey, the Magnitude is 5.8, that's hard. Maybe you should buy it. But, Put it somewhere where it can't fall. That happened hours ago.Update: @Jenn Moore Sorry. I was trying to look for the remote. I couldn't find several things on Amazon sometimes."
3,Good value and info,"I first borrowed a copy of ""1001 Natural Remedies"" from a friend, then realized it would be a good reference to have on hand. I'm getting good value for the price, as the recipes are concise and well-categorized.Eventually, you realize that the same 7 ingredients seem to make up the majority of these recipes. For the most part, one trip to the natural foods store will have you ready to concoct lip balm, stress-relieving bath salts and itchy scalp.It would be nice to have some specific product recommendations, as opposed to ""use an unscented, natural shampoo"". On the other hand, the author helpfully alerts you to recipes that will be messy.The photos are very nice, and made me check out things I might have ignored otherwise."
4,NIce alternatives to chemicals,"This book has exactly what I hoped it would and is simple to use. While it is not the encyclopedia of natural remedies, it is an excellent place to start. I bought it for a friend and it more than meets the objective."
5,Play like the Master!!!,"This book is very awesome. It has all the tabs for the ""Surfing with the Alien"" Joe Satriani album. While some of the notes may be a little off in a song or two, it's very well transcribed and tabbed. A lot of the stuff here is a little difficult, so I'd recommend it to a serious player who wants to do some serious shredding & rhytmn guitar. It's even better once you learn a whole song, pop the cd in the player, and play along with Joe.The feeling it's great, but you'll need to spend some time practicing. Remember, practice makes perfect."
2,Bing,This is Bing singing but it was not done in the traditional manner. It is a good CD but just not what I wanted.
5,CHRISTMAS IS BING CROSBY,THIS IS ONE OF MANY CHRISTMAS CDS BY THE MASTER. IF YOU LISTEN TO DO YOU HEAR WHAT I HEAR AND DONT GET THE HAIRS ON THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD STANDING UP OR YOUR HEART JUST STOPS FOR A FEW MINUTES OR MAYBE A TEAR OR TWO YOUR DEAD. TRY AND SEE A CLIP FROM A 1950S BOB HOPE CHRISTMAS SPECIAL WHERE BING SANG THIS SONG . IT WAS ONE OF VERY FEW RARE TVS GREATEST MOMENTS. AS JOHN WAYNE ONCE NARRATED A SONG ALBUM SAYING CHRISTMAS IS BING CROSBY.
2,Christmas muzak.,They should play this album repeatedly for captured terrorists until they beg us to stop. I'd sooner throw 199 pennies into the street than buy this.
4,Bing is the MAN,"No one does Christmas like Bing Crosby. I'm not old enough to actually be familiar with much of his music, but somehow I grew up to my family listening to it. Now I can't think of anyone else doing it any better than this."
5,Digital Memories,I love it. It has all the songs played by my parents at Christmas and the quality is very good. It gave me that audio link to my past.
5,A must have,"Ok, so I'm sentimental. I prefer Holiday Inn over White Christmas, I never get tired of ""It's a Wonderful Life"", and I was a young 'un who watched the Bing Christmas TV special where he performed with David Bowie.This album is what my memories are made of. you can listen to your local clear channel radio station, which started playing Christmas tunes after Labor Day, I tried, i couldn't name most ofthe artists, and honestly, ""Don't they know it's Christmas? "" Yeah, that gets me in the spirit.Simple, timeless renditions of simple timeless music. It will be playingin the background over Christmas Eve, invoking new memories."
5,Classic Christmas...,This album will be among most anyone's favorites...Bing Crosby's comforting voice brings the carols to life and conjures a mood of Christmases past. The CD includes an appearance by David Bowie and a little quipping with Bing.Definitely Classic.
5,Great workout!,"I love this workout, I'm glad that I finally found it after trying a ton of different videos out on the market. Many workouts are just okay, this is the only one that I've found to meet all of my requirements: increasing functional strength, working the core in novel and effective ways, relatively fun, and maximum results for the amount of time spent. Highly recommended."
2,Cute But Did Not Get All,I was looking forward to getting this toy for my son. But when I opened it up I was disappointed to see that there were only three tools inside the bag. I thought the picture showed several more tools. Maybe my tool kit was not complete. Either way my son never really showed much interest in it.
5,A must read for all who work with children and youth!!,"Ricky Greenwald has brilliantly illustrated a way for us to think about how to work with children & youth impacted by ""trauma"". The Child Trauma Handbook gives the reader ""hands on"" practice information that is grounded in evidence based practice strategies. I will this information to help me work more effectively in my clinical practice and in my classroom teaching!!"
1,Breathe Right Snore no Relief,"I bought this product for my husband whose snoring has become come louder every nite. It worked the first nite for some reason,and never worked after that. The best product has been the nose stripes and him sleeping on his stomach or side."
3,Hide your wallet,Works some what. The more you spray (3 minutes between) the better it works. You need to use 3 sprays to count as one. but is to expensive.
1,snore relief,I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED. THE QUANITY WAS LESS AND THE PRICE WAS HIGHER THAN A PREVIOUS PURCHASE WE HAD MADE.
2,tastes good but doesnt work,"My husband paid attention to my snoring with and without the spray and with and it made no difference at all. It does taste good and is fairly effective as a night time breath freshener, but it did not reduce the frequency or volume of my snoring or keep me from waking up with a dry scratchy throat."
5,save money on other sites,I couldnt believe what these were going for. I was on the other buying site and they are much cheaper! everyone should check it out! It rhymes with leebay. check out motorcyclevstarrider.
2,does not work,"This product did not work. Perhaps it may work if you don't have a deviated septum. Oh well, it was worth a try."
2,40 Bucks?!?.....,...You can't be serious.I know they don't make it anymore so this must be collectors item price.I think I'l find something else.
1,REBEL-DON'T BUY ! This is too EXPENSIVE,"My husband and I bought this for $15.00 Now they want to ram it down our throat, pardon the pun, for $40! Just don't buy it and they will have to come down. It does not work $40. worth of good. My husband would use it and I would have to quickly fall asleep or I would have to wake him up to use it again. So it is okay, but not for $49.!!!"
3,Rotato Potato Peeler,"I like the Rotato Potato Peeler but I found the arm that holds the blade to be a little too strong and did not want to let the blade ""float"" as smoothly as it should.It will peel potatoes faster than you can by hand if you have a little patience."
3,a so so product,"I would have preferred that the peeler be made of metal instead of plastic. The first time I used it, it broke. I called the 800 number and left a message and within 24 hours I was speaking with someone. I am still waiting for the new piece that broke. It has been well over a week. I am hoping that it doesn't break again!"
5,IT works,I got this one for a gift. But I own one that is about 8 years old and works like new. These things work built like a tanks. I only broke 3 blades in 8 years so they ast a long time if took care of.
3,So So,"The arm that holds the blade frequently breaks. It's easy enough to fix it, but very annoying."
5,What a great buy!,If you love potatoes but hate peeling them - this device is for you! It also peels fruit - I have used it for apples and mangos and it works perfectly. Way better than hand peeling and getting blisters from the knife - you'll have potatoes every night - peels in a flash!
2,ELEC. BETTER,I HAVE PURCHASED SEVERAL STYLES OF PEELERS. I REALLY DO LIKE THE ELEC. VERSION OF THIS STYLE. THE ELEC. IS WORTH THE MONEY !
1,Rotato Potato Peeler is not as good as the Rotato Express Peeler,"I loved the Rotato peeler but realized that the one I liked was the Rotato Express peeler. This particular model is operated by hand and it definitely is not a faster way to peel. The one that I got also had a defective connection on it's arm and would not stay together. I DON'T recommend this model but I DO recommend the Rotato Express Peeler over the Rotato Potato Peeler. The Rotato Express is electric and is quick and easy to operate. That is the one that I meant to purchase, but because of the similarities in the photo, I didn't realize that I bought the wrong one."
5,LOVE THE ROTATO!,"I have 3 rotatos... 2 manual & 1 battery operated. When it is time to make applesauce, mashed potatoes for 50 people, or peel any kind of fruit & vegetable (I even do carrots!) this is the machine to use!I have had 2 of them for many years & only gone through 2 blades each... Love it!"
5,Que vive la plena,"I am enjoying this cd very much. I just got some panderetos so I am into it! Great deal and fast delivery, thank you."
3,Se pone repetitivo,"Yo me compre este disco despues de escuchar una de las canciones del grupo con altas expectativas. Desafortunadamente no fue tan bueno como esperaba. No porque ninguna cancion en particular sea mala, sino porque los arreglos son muy parecidos, el toque del cencerro a veces nunca cambia, etc."
4,"Sweet, Floral, and long lasting","Has a sweet floral scent with little ambiguity. Pretty direct and to the point. The scent would probably best suit a mature women. The scent does last a long time, and a little goes a long way. So, I am rating it 4 stars because it is a well made perfume, even though it is too sweet for my taste."
1,Broken,This item worked great for about two weeks. It then proceeded to take in a CD and would not play it or reject the CD. I had to return it with the CD still in it. This item has some problems and I would advise against buying it. Please do not ignore the reviews on this item.
1,STAY AWAY FROM DENON,"Can I give negative stars? I had my system for one month and it died. That was in May. It is now September and my replacement shipment has just shipped. It was only replaced because I called 500+ times, sent emails to the entire company and was basically a daily sqeaky wheel till I got some results. I have never delt with such poor customer service...ever. Stay away from Denon. I wish I bought a Bose."
5,Denon Great Value,"I saw some mixed reviews to this product but I am delighted. The sound quality is fantastic, much better than the BOSE 123 I used to own. The I-Pod connectivity is an added plus as well. The remote can be tempremental but for the $400 price tag the system it is easily worth it. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a 3.1 system."
4,Rock solid for what it is,"I have had this unit since shortly after it originally came out, as a bedroom system. So it's been seeing daily use for years. As it is, it's been a rock solid performer which has not broken.Just don't expect anything resembling real surround sound. The sound quality is good, though not audiophile grade. Plenty of hookups for most users. I wish I could upgrade to the same unit with blu-ray and better speakers, but Denon doesn't make anything like this anymore."
1,terrible troubled and desperate,I also purchased this unit with the intention that it was trouble free--But what a surprise. I didnt believe others as to it failability and numerous problems--but after 5 monthes it happened to me. This unit failed not only mechanically but the company and its representitives as well. I am sick and tired of retuning this unit {3 times } and getting it back to work for a little while. You would think a respected company would care for its customers and correct things to their satisfaction----DO NOT BUY this unit it only brings TROUBLE
5,Couldn't put it down,"I only meant to brouse a little, read the first story and couldn't put it down. The introduction is well worth reading. With my busy schedule it's sometimes hard to even think about starting a novel. I love to read. This is a great balance."
1,This is not Chick Lit,"This was not any kind of lit. Just a bunch of junk compiled to make enough pages to print a book. Who edited this stuff. I'll give it to the used book store, and hope it hit's the 50 cent table. And I hope no one else tries to suffer through it like I tried, and suffer I did!"
4,Something Different,"I enjoy chick lit and am proud of it! But I agree with Elizabeth Merrick that a lot of the chick lit novels out these days all seem the same. I picked up this book after reading about it in USA Today. The stories are funny and unusual. If you are looking for something different, pick up this book!"
3,"Excellent Digital, but a battery drainer!","COMPARED TO other cameras - this digital camera sucks your batteries dry after a few uses (or not uses). This Digital Camedia NEEDS LOTS OF battery power to function! We found that if you take a few pictures (1-10)- your battery will last up to 2 days. If you are planning a birthday, or any other all day event - take extra and extra batteries - because within the hour - the batteries are drained! Rechargeables, are highly recommended. Otherwise, you'll be spending a few bucks on batteries every week just to keep the camera usage powered up. Excellent digital though, but horrible on battery usage!"
1,Love It Hate It,"I am very disappointed with The quality of this camera.It is very unpredictable. No wait ,I can predict that it will drive me nuts!Right from the start I had problems with the pictures not downloading. The USB cable does not fit correctly and has to be held in a certain position to work,if it does at all. As if that was not enough , sometimes the auto focus malfunctions.THE SHUTTER SPEED IS VERY SLOW SO YOU HAVE TO USE THE FLASH ALWAYS.I am happy with the pictures it takes ,but using the camera is torture.I have sent comments to the company which have been completely ignored.I paid almost $300.00 for this camera and apparently Olympus could care less that I am unhappy with my purchase.I WILL NEVER BY ANOTHER CAMERA FROM THEM.I would rate this MINUS FIVE -*****!"
4,Really nice,I bought this as a gift for my mother for Christmas and she loves it. We have it hanging on our sliding glass window and the light looks so pretty coming through the green and blue stained glass. It was smaller than I had anticipated but I was not disappointed at all. The item looks genuinely hand crafted and is really nice to look at. We like it a lot.I would recommend it.
1,Gross,Tasted great until I found bugs in it. I don't think I'll be buying this brand of anything ever again.
3,Could be better.,"Well, this is a free Kindle edition of this book. There are no formatting problems, except lack of any pictures. That is a big mistake, as the text makes reference to the pictures so often, that one wonders how this book is functional without them. The book is just fine, or it would be, if it did not describe most of the pictures in such detail. It really lets you know what you missed in buying this edition. It's not bad, but it's not good either. All I am saying, is that being a history of ART, there should be some ART to see in the book. Common sense isn't so common, I guess."
1,laurishy,"I just bought this at Target and I can't even watch it. My almost 2 year old LOVES his other Barney tape, so I thought this would be a good one....WRONG. This is the ""new"" Barney and, if you ask me, it stinks! My kid lost interest in 5 minutes which NEVER happens with his other tape that he's watched probably a hundred times!!"
5,Excellent purchase,The product works with no problem. Great buy for a low cost. I have connected PC to TV and watching movies in the big screen now.
5,Does what its suppose to do,"Hey, this product works what more can you ask of a cable. If your sales guy insinuates that you have to spend $80 to get a good quality 10-15 foot cable, tell him that he is misleading you. Ask him what else is he misleading you about.Actually, if you are spending the amount of money to buy a product that requires a DVI or HDMI cable, shouldn't the cable should be included."
1,Burnt My Video Card,"I try to use this cable whit my lcd and it burnt my video card ,, i think was the cable was wront , but what i con do now .. i lost my card . i cant recomende it"
5,perfect!,Works just like the 3' long one I got from Best Buy for $75.. I guess that is where the make their money.
2,Boring Video; definately NOT for beginners,"This workout was very hard for me to get into; I became very bored by it. The moves were challenging but the routine was blah. If you are a beginner, this is not for you. You are better off purchasing ""Quick Fix Stability Ball Workout"" no matter what your level of fitness."
2,"Not a good one, try another",This is not a good routine. Boring and doesn't really flow. You would definetly do better with with Quick Fix Stability Ball Workout or Karen Voights Ball workout.Check my other review on Amazon for the best choices in exercise and yoga DVDs. Thanks!
2,Not so great,"I've owned this dvd for about a year and use it periodically for a switch from the ones I really like. The instructor is very wordy - there are big gaps so she can instruct before an exercise actually starts. I find her voice and her repeated ""wunnerful"" annoying. The exercises range from too easy to really hard. Music is fine, set is supposed to be a stage set of Great Salt Lake shore or something. I'm giving this dvd away now, after having given it a fair shot. Its boring and now, off even on my ""alternative dvds"" shelf."
3,just so-so,"Like other reviewers commented, this is intermediate in intensity and gets boring quickly, although far from the worst I've seen. I like theQuick Fix - Stability Ball Workoutmuch better, bought both at the same time and never use this one anymore."
1,try another one,The workout was boring on this video. True beginners would be the only ones who would get a workout from this video.
3,A ball workout for intermediates,"This ball workout is definitely for someone familar with the balance ball. The frog is an especially tough excerise and the instructor does not go into good enough detail on how to do it. I've used the ball for over a year now, and got this video about 2 months ago. I've done this workout at least 10x and still have yet to master the frog! I definitely would not recommend this video to beginners - one by Suzanne Deason would be much more helpful."
2,Not up to Par,"I'm inclined to believe this tape sat on a shelf for a long time as it lacks the same adherence I've found in using the same tape prior to purchasing it through Amazon. I have been using this brand for a few years buying it per roll in the local pharmacy and this is the first time I've had a problem, also the first time I've purchased in bulk to save a few dollars. Perhaps I made a mistake."
5,A Cowboy Fling,"I spent last weekend reading this very sexy anf sometimes funny book by this new author. I enjoyed it very much. I have not been a Harelequin reader in the past but I think I am hooked.. The reason I obtained the book , a girl friend gave me her copy.Good Luck to this new author Best Nancy Jensen"
1,Pointless,"Very disappointing. No actual scientific evidence presented. It wasn't even structured like a book, it is just basically a bunch of ""lectures"" put into book form. There has to be something better out there for looking at Jesus's lost teachings."
1,The Bible is The True teachings,"This book is big bunch of false crap.Anyone at all that has studied the Bible, knows that everything that one needs to know, is written in His word. It is written there and given by many different witnesses.John the Baptist was the last ""prophet"", and anyone that tells you different is either misinformed or a liar.Mark 13 vs. 23; Jesus telling his disciples: ""But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.""Jesus tell us right here, that He has told us everything needed to know. That when He returns, there should be no excuses.It doesn't matter what any man says, only what Christ has said. Have You read His word?"
3,Fun cd,"This collection of songs is a lot of fun. I'd never heard the Motorhead song on here before, and I have to say that it smokes."
2,Like a desert...,"...this book is dry and empty. While browsing through this book, I was struck by its lack of real content. The quality and quantity of the information were essentially identical to the four page ""tips sheet"" that came with my package of resume paper. A more careful review found that the sample resumes were barely relevant to today's ""high-tech"" marketplace, and I was appalled to see duplicate cover letters used to pad the book! Two stars because of price, otherwise not recommended."
3,Mixed Bag,"While there are definite moments on this cd including White Dogs, Smack, and The Ocean, My Floor, there are also songs like ""Love In"" which is one of the most left field album closers I've heard. When this band turns up their guitars and jams like on ""White Dogs"" and ""The Ocean, My Floor"" they are amazing, yet maybe I haven't listened to them enough to appreciate the more withdrawn side.Regardless those two songs are fantastic and the punkish pop of Smack is great, yet I can't see why ""Love In"" wasn't towards the beginning as it makes no sense as an album closer. Still, this won't be leaving my collection very soon."
2,Too difficult to research,"This book may contain great information, but unless you're committed to sitting down and reading it cover to cover, this won't be your most helpful resource. This book has no index in the back, so if you want to look up a specific topic, you've only got chapter and section headings, and then you have to scan through pages and pages to find what you're looking for. I've got 4 aromatherapy books, and I barely ever crack this one open because it's too much work to find what I'm looking for. There are much better books out there!"
4,Good info about the basic essential oils.,"I'm not an expert on aromatherapy, so this is my point of view as an amateur.The book have some good facts and info about essential oils during different times in history. It also have many recipes. It separates a few oils in groups, depending if they are a base/middle or top, and in other groups like zodiac and planets.But it lacks on variety of essential oils. I know this is not a new book, so I was a little dissapointed to see only the ""basic"" ones. but in general this is a good and interesting book."
5,Quite Empowering,I found A New Attitude by Marian Thomas to be exceptional and quite empowering. It covers a lot of ground in a small compact book. Gives you reflection pages to help you learn and understand more about yourself. We are putting together a library at work for our employees that include training and self empowering materials. This was a book I read for review and quickly put it in the library for others to share.
3,Not bad.,Music maker deluxe is a pretty basic program. You can do alot with it if you put in the work.
3,A good start,"I picked up this book because I wasn't sure which manual would be the best. The good news is it's a fast-read and it shows you what your computer screen will really look like. But the bad news is it doesn't really help you out. It just explains basic functions. For example, it will say, click on Billing and then Finance to do so-and-so. Read the choices and pick the one you want. It never says, if you're trying to do so-and-so, the best way is to do this. And if you're trying to figure out when to update your account, try entering in your figures during the month. Don't worry about waiting till you have your entire statement. There's no real advice in the book. Just directions. As a beginner to this program, I was looking for advice. As a computer-savvy person, I could figure out much of the information in the book, just by exploring the program. I'm afraid I'll have to pick up another book on this subject."
3,headrests,"I was very happy with the appearance, quality and shipping time of the product. Overall I was pleased. The only problem occured once we had them installed. Only one screen would turn off when the car turned off. The other headrest had to be turned off manually or by using the remote."
5,Top Of The Line Impact Wrench,"I have been using this tool for almost (2) months and nothing has stopped it or slowed it down. My first use was with a harmonic balancer that had been on forever. Normally I would use my 3/4 in tool with the job, but wanted to test the IR. The tool did not even labor and the bolt was out. The light weight makes it easy to handle and you won't tire from production work. Don't look any further, you will likt this tool."
5,SO CUTE!,My girls like these iPod sleeves. Cute colors and they do a great job of protecting them from getting dropped and dirty. I just wish their were more colors available. But no worries. I'm a very happy customer!
1,"Compelled To Read, Save Money & Get Book From Library","The author is a 32-year-old former journalist who claims to be an expert on selling and motivation. His book on sales is a waste of money. His video offering simply confirms that this ""Two Month"" wonder is superficial at best.When I saw this book, my low expectations were not exceeded. This book, like other offerings by the author, reflects his superficial approach.If you want to give away money, rather than giving it to the author, make a donation to charity. You will end up feeling better and have not wasted your money or time on a puff-piece book.If you feel compelled to read this book, I would not, save your money and find the book at a library. In the end, you will be happy you did waste your money."
2,A couple OK tunes,"I bought the CD for a memory ""Streets of London""..good song....but beyond that and a couple of neat finger picking Ragtime type tunes, the remaining music was mostly slow, dreary accoustic originals you get a lot for your money, 24 songs, but overall tempo way too slow and ""help the downtrodden"" themes too depressing for me.,"
1,THIS GAME SUCKS,"I'm tired of seeing this game have a five star average everytime I see it. This game is awful. Don't buy it, it sucks."
2,Dummies buy this book,"Too general to be useful. Too trite to be tolerated. I read the whole thing in about an hour, and realized it was geared mostly to non-fiction writers, held dubious advice about calling editors directly (against a mountain of evidence to the contrary about how much editors do not want to receive phone calls), and was really only a superficial glossing over the topic. The 'Sell-Your-Novel Toolkit' by Elizabeth Lyon seems more helpful."
2,Getting your book published for those who already have,"This book was a disappointment. The reviews below pretty much reflect my problems with the book. Another problem I had concerned promotion. The authors assume that every aspiring author already has extensive media contacts. The sample proposal they give is from 2 college professors who have already published 2 books and have been featured on national TV and raidio. Now come on, most people who buy this book have not been on national TV and have no idea where to begin a promotional campaign. That's why they buy this book in the first place! Instead of telling us how to establish media contacts to use in the proposal, the authors simply tell us to use all our media contacts in the proposal. If I already had media contacts I wouldn't have needed the book.In sum, if you havn't already published a few books and havn't been on national TV, this book will leave you with many lingering questions."
2,Definitely for Dummies,"For the total novice who has very limited experience in writing and publishing, this book will be treasure trove, especially if that novice is planning to write a non-fiction book. For everyone else, this book has lesser value. I found it offered very little for writers of fiction. The information offered was also rather basic; for a person with a moderate amount of writing experience, the book offered little in the way of insightful information. The ""for Dummies"" part of the title definitely applies in this case."
2,Not quite useful,"Not quite useful. I did not liked it. In fact, I found it a little boring. It is for dummies all right."
4,Any aspiring author NEEEEEEDS this book,"It's a bit dated, but it really shows a lot of the intricacies involved with the DIFFERENT TYPES OF PUBLISHING. It was a bit weak on the POD side, and somewhat dated for the traditional publishing method, but all in all, I can't see writing a book-then trying to publish it-without reading this book."
4,Lots of information and ideas,"For those of us who have never published this is an excellent place to start. I suggest reading it cover to cover, even if you already have a book ready for publishing, because it is so full of ideas for discovering your next publication and how to improve any you already have."
3,A Good Read for Early Teens,"I began reading the book because I love Connie Willis. After 20 pages, I was disappointed; after 50 or so pages, I was mad. The only thing that kept me going was the fervent hope that the unbug would get squashed after mortally wounding the shallow and obnoxious ""heroine."" And then, unexpectedly, I began to enjoy the story, mostly because of the science-fiction elements, and I realized that if this book were marketed for young people, it would be quite good. It's a very moral story... the wretched Delanna sees the error of her thinking, proves to be a hard worker, kind to animals both warm and cold-blooded, and learns to love a good and uncomplicated hunk of a man. And there are no scenes you would be embarrassed to read aloud to your 13-year-old daughter, who I think is the perfect audience for this rather charming but predictable story. I hope there's a sequel, perhaps written more towards adults... and this time, the unbug gets it."
2,"Bad beginning, slightly entertaining in the end","When I first picked up this book, I detested the main character and her bug as shallow, stupid, unadaptable and spoiled. I plowed through only because I love Connie Willis. Once Delanna, the main character, reaches her farm, things began to amuse me more - however, that might only be because I enjoy romance. The book was predictable, the characters infuriating and their emotions undecipherable - who moons after a five-year-old for fifteen years, anyway? And why does Delanna like Cadiz so much when all she ever does is complain? On second thoughts, maybe that is why - they're kindred spirits. Connie Willis can do so much better!"
2,Stale flat and uninspired,"I was unable to find anything particularly interesting in the story, characters, setting or anything. I only give it 2 stars because it was easy to read andthere wasn't anything that particularly made me cringe. THe protagonist shows up to find herself married to a country bumpkin. Only she doesn't find out for a it because she keeps on interrupting people who are about to let that fact beknown. I thought that plot device died with 80s sitcoms."
2,A disappointment,"I thought that Connie Willis's The Doomsday Book and To Say Nothing of the Dog were just great: clever, inventive, and character-driven. She even made me into a big Jerome K. Jerome fan! So I was really disappointed to realize that Promised Land was just a formula romance novel (of the most strait-laced kind) with formula characters and plot devices. Too bad."
2,A departure from the authors' normal style,"I have always been favorably impressed the writing of both Ms. Willis and Ms. Felice so I bought this book in delightful anticipation of an excellent read. To say I was disappointed is putting in mildly. The plot was trite, the characters were cardboard and that's only judging it as a light romance novel. I know it's possible to write what is, IMHO, a good science fiction romance. Anne McCaffrey did it in Restoree and Ann Maxwell did it in Timeshadow Rider and Fire Dancer.Since I've been accused of lacking the sense of humor necessary to appreciate this type of book, I'll simply say that I personally didn't feel the book represented the style I expected from either author and being the curmudgeon that I am I was disappointed"
2,Not her best effot,Nah. It's sort of a trashy love story set on a distant planet. Perhaps the problem was the collaboration. I made it all the way to the end but was annoyed with myself for doing so.
3,Romance novel knockoff,"Connie Willis is amazing, wonderful, deep, and witty. Which makes me wonder why she wrote this book: it's a Harlequin romance only set on a different planet.For fun and romance, try her Bellweather. Later, read Firewatch, which I consider one of her unappreciated best. Just please, don't take this as an accurate example of her brilliance."
2,A disappointment,"A badly written romance novel. The plot is contrived and the main character is thoughtless and unsympathetic. It's hard to believe Connie Willis wrote this, since her other books are so much better."
2,My Soul Doth Magnify the Lord!,The inside of the book is like new. The front and back cover are okay.My first impression was that it looked and felt a bit dirty.
5,nice,"Easy even for an amateur. In fact, this the second one that I have bought. I lost the first one."
1,Glass,They were slow in arriving and don't cut worth a d--m I couldn't get them to do more then scratch the surface of a window I was trying to cut...had better luck useing a diamond blade on my rotozip
1,instructions,"The product arrivd in time as it was described but i was hoping to get some instructions on how to use it and there were none. I tried it but it didn't work, maybe I'm not using it right!"
5,fit great,The mats fit great. I have not fastened them in yet. The color matched well. Not a dead on color but all the carpet is covered so what does it matter.
5,Very honest,When I first got this book I thought it would be boring. But this book makes you feel like your in the story. I remember that once I started reading it I couldn't stop reading it. She is an excellent writer and I can't wait to get another one of her books.
3,Just another textbook that will surely be superceded to maintain textbook industry existence,"I bought this book used a long time ago to help me study for some CLEP/DANTES exams, but it was just too in depth. I skimmed over it for some general ideas and to get the jist of Labor Relations, then went out and got a specific study guide instead- passed the test regardless.Now if only I could get rid of all the superceded books on my shelf that nobody will buy because they come out with a newer edition every year or two (for no justifiable reason). Ahh the profiteering involved in ""higher education""... keep the youth aspiring to ""be something better"", keep them buying the same but different books, keep them in school instead of on the street, or in the workforce competing for jobs that there will never be enough of... oh the failures of endless growth economics..."
5,Great for your truck lover!,"My almost 3-year old son picked this DVD out at the library and has watched it daily. The DVD comprises of video clips of various trucks on the road. Each truck group has it's own song - which is a catchy, rock kind of a song. I personally cannot sit through the DVD because it cannot hold my attention - however it holds the attention of my son and my 5-year old daughter. Great way for your little truck lover to get his or her fill of trucks!"
4,Good,"I think I expected excellence but got good. We watch it but it's not a favorite when we can choose from Concrete Truck, Garbage Truck or this. They could have taken a bit more time on some of the shots and gone into a bit more detail."
1,lots and lots of trucks vol1,"As stated previously in lots and lots of trucks Vol 2, this is not worth the money paid and am trying to return same....this video is just songs and no narratives. Grandson very disappointed in these and told me that I wasted my money getting them."
3,Hide your eyes,I had a hard time getting started. But as I continued to read it became more engaging. Half way through I read longer because I don't want to put it down.I will read the next one.
3,Hide Your Eyes by Samantha Leiffer,"Disappointing after first reading ""And She Was"" by the same author which was EXCELLENT........... ""Hide Your Eyes"" was boring in comparison!"
4,Hide Your Eyes,I enjoyed reading Hide Your Eyes by Allison Gaylin. I am really looking forward to reading more of her books.
3,A deft early effort with some problems,"After reading the excellent AND SHE WAS, I had to go back and see some of this author's earlier work. This, I believe, is one of her first novels. It was enjoyable, but flawed--the mix of humor with dark suspense (very dark--the murder of children) did not really gel and Gaylin got bogged down in her plot, taking time away from what could have been a suspenseful story for fluffy passages about the main character's work that didn't really advance the story (although it helped us know better her very likable main character). Verdict: I would read the next book in this series, with the hope the author learned from her mistakes in this outing."
5,"Funny, engaging, suspenseful -- a real winner","This is smart, funny book set in the neurotic artsy-fartsy world which just happens to also be a great, suspenseful murder mystery. It's a unique combination that really works. The heroine is as far a cry as you could get from the typical hardboiled tough guy you might expect to be tracking down murderers. In fact, all of the characters are wonderfully fleshed out, not a cardboard cut-out stereotype in the lot. It's hard to believe that this is the author's debut novel. A great, fun read."
3,uneven storytelling,"I liked aspects of this book.The pacing seems a bit rough to me through most of the book.The characters are not quite cookie-cutter, but nothingfreshly original, either.I think the apsect that works the least is thejuxtapostion of humor and gruesome crime.Some authors write about gruesome crimes and can havetheir lead: detective, or coroner, or amatuer sleuth crackone-liners, go off and fall right back into their lives as if nothing has happened and have it work and not seem callous. The attitude seems to fit the character. Not so for Samantha. Somehow, for me, the humordoesn't come off in this book.By no means a bad read. Just, uneven.I will be giving Gaylin's next effort a try."
1,What could have been a good book ruined by a literary device,"I'm a big reader of forensic studies of crime, but this one hits a new low in clunky formats. Lee (with co-author LaBriola) reviews a number of famous cases, including the murders of Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman, the JonBenet Ramsey case, the Lindbergh kidnappingm, the Sacco and Vanzetti trials and more. Lee and LaBriola's analysis of the cases themselves are intriguing, but why, oh why did they feel it necessary to encumber the book with the fictional character of one ""Sam Constant?"" This ""dream"" character materializes to draw Lee back in time to visit the older cases, or in the more recent ones, to deliver his opinion as the voice of the General Public. It's a terrible device, blundering and awkward, badly written, and in the end manages to make the authors look foolish and takes away from their veracity as scientists."
1,yesterday upon the stair.....,"Primarily a history of an impressive project to analyse the layers of snow fall on the Greenland ice cap, the book suffers from lack of focus and from unfortunate efforts at being easily approachable and topical. It is strongest at revealing the influence of variation in earth's orbit on local Greenland (and nearby North American) climate, but even here the information is presented hurriedly and one comes away knowing little more of the various climaticaly significant orbital changes the data reveals.At it's weakest point however, there is a sad attempt to relate the ice core data to global warming. This could be parodied as ""there is no evidence of recent dramatic global warming in the ice core data, therefore global warming exists."" To be kinder, the author feels ""since I know global warming exists from other sources, the lack of data supporting global warming in my ice cores means this must be an entirely new sort of warming."" There clearly is an easier explanation."
2,Disappointing reproductions,I was really disappointed when I received the book. Most reproductions are washed out and I kept wondering if I would love this Van Dyck's work any more if his paintings look like that. I've seen many originals and their reproductions in this book are too bad for a serious catalog.
5,"an incredible painter, a fantastic exhibition.",One of the greatest painters of all time is well represented by his greatest paintings in this exhibition and hence - this catalog. Be prepared to be amazed by a painter of prodigious talent.
5,best dbz book i ever read.,"This book is great!If your a new dbz fan and love it so far but dont know much or want to know more.Then buy this book.It gives you funny jokes,some quizzes,how to play the role-playing-game and more.i reccomend this book to any dragon ball z fan."
3,Dubbie Book,"There are quite a few errors in the book. Dubbies make me mad, but I digress. Overall this was an ok book, good action figure and card guides."
5,Insightful,"Al Maxey is a genuine scholar. Very knowledgeable, but humble. Reasons from the scriptures with true exegesis. True, he is a friend of mine for 17 years but this is the best book explaining the scriptures on marriage and divorce."
3,not a relaxing workout,this is a tough yoga workout - not like I normally do - much more aerobic than relaxing
1,wrong DVD in the case,"Based on my experience, I would strongly recommend that you not purchase this DVD. When I recently received this DVD, it appeared that I had received the correct one based on the case and the label on the DVD itself. However, when I played the DVD, it was evident that it was not a yoga DVD. I contacted the company and they stated that they were aware of the production problem. They stated that I needed to send back the DVD with a note explaining the problem, my name, address, and phone number. They didn't even volunteer to pay for shipping to return the DVD for THEIR error. I purchased this DVD because my time is often limited. I resent having to waste it for their error. After several email exchanges, I've just told them they can keep their DVD. On the final email, they finally suggested that I contact Amazaon directly. I have never had a problem where I had to return a product from Amazon. I'm so fed up right now, I'm going to just forget it!"
5,Wonderful toy!,I love this brand of toys because they require no batteries (green!) and they are super durable. My two-year old got this as a Christmas present and 4 months later still plays with it constantly. Nothing broken and very fun!
2,Definite quality control issues...,"The WOW Harry Copter's Animal Rescue Safari Vehicle (that's a helicopter, people) would be a great set, if it wasn't for the fact that it has some definitely quality control issues. Like so many others are reporting, the helicopter rotor has issues and now doesn't spin all the time when you pull the trigger. You can hear that it's not catching the way it should, so I'm guessing there must be some gear that strips with even moderate use. They call it a sturdy handle in the product description, but the mechanism behind it surely isn't.It's a shame too, because my two year-old daughter loves this toy. She loves the little animals which attach to the rescue copter via a magnet, she loves the little doctor pilot figure (Dr. Harry Copter, I presume...) and she loves the rescue copter itself. As much as she loves it though, it's hard to recommend any toy that isn't going to last even two weeks."
3,Made well but consider the child's age.,"This was really cute and made quite well but the age on the unit is set way too old. It is not a toy for a 5 year old, let alone a 4 year old. I bought it for my grandson who was two at the time. He was kind of bored with It!"
3,a ticket to tomahawk,It's a fun old movie filmed mostly in Colorado in the early 50's. This movie has lots of Colorado narrow gauge railroad shots and even has a brief part with a very young Maryln Monroe. It's a good movie but very hard to find.
3,Drawn out baggage,"I have read all of Monica Mcinerneys novels and I found that this one and the Alphabet Sisters have been hard work to read.Her first three novels were fantastic - kept you interested from the first to the last page with a funny, believable storyline.This one (Family Baggage) was such a chore, its not a small book (482 pages)and to be quite honest could have been written in about 300 pages without missing anything. I hope she realises that her reading audience is basically, the chick lit audience, that are cash rich and time poor - so either keep the novel more interesting or shorten the size. I'll think twice before reading another one."
2,Don't weigh yourself down with Family Baggage,"I loved Mcinerney's previous book, The Alphabet Sisters. But this book was weighed down with weak characters and a plot centered around a discovery that I didn't think warranted the reaction of the character most affected. Mcinerney was reaching throughout the whole book. She reached with a weak main character and a weak discovery that was supposed to be shocking but fell short. If you haven't read her previous book, go for that one and skip the Baggage."
1,TEDIOUS,"I thought this book would never end. It could have been over with in 200 pages tops. The characters were uninteresting and the story was boring. The writing was tedious and read like a romance novel. I am not passing this on to anyone, I wouldn't want to put my friends through the torture."

5,Works Perfectly,This Swingline electric paper punch works like it should. I recommend it to anyone who needs to hole punch bundles of paper.
2,"Beautiful Watch, However It Does Not Work!!!","Deeply Disappointed In the WorkmanshipThis is the second watch I have ordered from Amazon. The first one, shoddy workmanship. The Anne Klein watch simply does not work. I will be returning this one tomorrow."
4,"Watch not gold-tone, it's silver-tone","The description on this watch says gold-tone and it's actually silver-tone. I like the watch, it is a little large for me but I understand that is the new style now."
2,Battery can't be changed.,I had this watch for about a year. The battery ran out and there is no obvious way to change it.
1,Pretty piece of garbage,"What this watch has going for it is that it's lovely to look at. Unfortunately, most people - including myself - are looking for a watch that will also tell time. This will not. I had it for a few months and the light stopped working, then another month went by and the watch stopped working. I had the battery replaced and it stopped working a few weeks after. Then I sent it to be repaired in accordance with the warranty information, it worked for another few months and is now dead again. I am really disgusted with the quality of this watch - $48 isn't a huge amount for a watch but it's not small change to me either. Unfortunately, adding what I paid for the battery and the repair shipping, I am now out of $68."
4,Old School Alien Invasion Paranoia Classic,"This story starts off with the captivating paranoia of Jack Archer, spying on his quirky and mysterious neighbor, Mr. Fleshman. With frustrating family members, taunting friends, creepy voices, and an impending national doom, R.L. Stine saves this book from being absurd and cringe-worthy. The mystery and sci-fi suspense is enough to make a reader run to the bookstores to find out what happens in the sequel."
5,Synopsis:,"As Aliens come from a distant planet , humans lves are at stake as these aliens want the power humans have. All they have to do squeeze you..."
1,GOOSEBUMPS at it's worst! Avoid!,"Since GOOSEBUMPS has gotten really famous, R.L. Stine lost histouch. The first few books were good, but since about thetwenty-third, it's gotten really bad. This one is only good because of the suprise that pops at you late in the book. The charecters aren't real at all, the plots are just barely good, and the stories are stupid. GOOSEBUMPS SERIES 2000 has really gone downhill from the start. This story is the second part of Jack Acher's story of an alien landing in his hometown and getting power by squeezing people. I mean, COME ON! I started not to bother with R.L. Stine after I got to about age eleven because I was introduced to really good books and realized how childish his books are. This one was my favorite, but that doen't mean it's any good.... It just means the others are worse. Avoid R.L. Stine except for his autobiography, IT CAME FROM OHIO!. There's almost nothing good in his books anymore."
4,FYI,"This set is available in MP3, although Amazon has not provided the link yet. It is here:G.I. Jukebox, Original Hits from the Swing Era, 1938-1946."
5,"Tommie Weber's ""Chasing Miracles"" Unsung Heroes - Inspiring!","Turn off the T.V., log on and buy this book. It will inspire you and make you want to buy copies for Christmas gifts!! A book has to grab me in the first few pages or I will not finish it. This story keeps your attention the entire way - Did I say ""story"". Fact or fiction?...You decide!"
3,"Good book, but very poor English translation","I love the Chinese version of the book, so I decided to order the English version for a good friend. I was shocked to see that the English translation was terrible. It is over simplified, and loses the original meaning and feel. I recommend the original Chinese version of the book, and find a friend or someone who knows Chinese to translate it for you (it's not all that hard!)."
5,"Lovely book , meaningful story",This is a beautiful book that simplified the meaning of fate and chances in a very lovely clever way. I love it.
1,It really [stinks],"The translation of the English version is """"totally"""" different from the original."
5,"Thought provoking, and extremely worthwhile","This is a must read for the late thirty to mid fifty year old individual who seemingly has it all, and yet is experiencing a sense of emptiness.Based on the author's work with accomplished executives, Aspirations of Greatness has a message which is a bit contrarian in the self improvement area. Instead of a ""rah-rah"" here is what you have to do to have joy and happiness, the author talks about going downward and inward in order to experience the type of growth that can lead to meaningful, permanent life changes.I highly recommend this book for the mid-life person who is asking: ""Is this all there is?"" There is so much more than what you may be experinecing and Aspirations of Greatness provides a great roadmap to achieving a sense of purpose and fulfillment."
2,Also Disappointed,"I agree with ""Disappointed"". I too found this title in the romance section, only to find very little in the way of romance in the book. Also, eharlequin.com had a prequel to this story for several weeks before ""Proof"" was released, and the main character featured in the online prequel was not the same main character featured in the book (but will be featured in a later title). I felt that my time was wasted reading the prequel, as there was no cohesiveness between the online prequel and the first book in the series. I hope the other titles in the series prove to be more entertaining."
1,This book was terrible,"I just had to wiite a review. When I read the back, the book showed potential, so I bought it. I NOW REGRET IT,THIS BOOK IS BOOOORING TO A CAPITAL T. If someone wanted to start reading a series book this is definitely not the one to start with, because it can give the preconception that if this is bad, I dread to read the others. I had a hard time completely reading this book, I was jumping all over the initial chapters till I got fustrated and read the last chapter and even that was booring. This is the first time I have read this author's book and I have no intention of reading her past,present or future novels. Goodbye Athena Force."
5,movie fan,Weird stuff abounds in this compilation of some of the Muppet's weirdest moments on TV - and a few new laughs including an impressive assortment of famous guest stars.Julie Andrews ismarvelous. Do not miss it.
4,FUN BUT A LITTLE OVER HYPED,"This is a fun and enjoyable game but Ive been hearing an extreme lot about how it is one of the best made games ever and I ust dont agree. Its good and plays very similiar to Devil May Cry or Onimusha games. However some downfalls are that it is too short(can easily complete in one weekend)gives you the feeling that your breezing through the game without getting your moneys worth, combat and puzzles are too simple until near the end of the game, takes a long time to upgrade weapons, only 2 or 3 bosses in the entire game. Now the good Great graphics, interesting characters and decent enough storyline, explicit and violent combat, and the game is well guided and not too maze like, and very little loading between levels. OVERALL is a good game here worth the $50 for most but some may feel like they did not get enough as like I said 90% of God of War the average gamer will breeze right through."
5,A Milestone In Gaming,"God Of War Is An Amazing Achievement In The World Of Video Games, Combat Better That Devil May Cry, Graphics Better Than MGS3 And Amazing Gameplay. Do Not Hesitate To Buy This Game!"
1,Is God Mode Even Possible???,"I bought this as a used copy from my local game store, and although it has some strong points, it's also absolutely maddening. The graphics and music are great, but some parts of this game are almost impossible to pass even in easy mode. It took FOREVER to get through, but I finally beat it. However, you have to pass Challenge of the Gods to get some of the unlockables, and these challenges cannot be one under any circumstances. The sixth one has you trying to jump across some moving platforms while guys are shooting arrows at you. The designers give you a whopping 40 seconds to finish it. After two (yes, two!) frustrating hours of screaming and swearing trying to beat it, I ended up getting so mad at it that I snapped the disc in two and threw it out. Do NOT buy this game - unless, of course, you want to get so angry that you throw your controller through the TV screen."
1,Won't Load On First -Generation PS2s!!,"I also was unable to get God of War to load on a first-generation PS2. I have one of the original PS2s bought on the first day of release. I've gone back and exchanged the disc twice but the game refuses to load on this PS2. My machine is still loading all my other recent titles (e.g., Champions: Return to Arms; X-Men Legends), so I do believe it's a coding/manufacturing bug. Don't know yet if I'll upgrade my PS2 just to play this title."
1,Not working,"Unfortunately, this game did not work on my nephews PS2. We tried to look into the problem, but it could not be solved. We tried to contact the company for help, and we could not get through on the telephone. I would like to know how I can get a refund, since the game is faulty. I logged on to the internet and discovered many other gamers that had the same problem we did. The game would not load on the PS2 and then it would completely stop. We tried several other games and they all worked. My nephew was really disappointed, since he could not play the game and I am out $19.99, Will I be able to get a reimbursement? Or is it too late? I hope the company will look into the game and find out what went wrong."
2,i agree -- so so hack and slash that was overhyped,"I agree with one of the previous reviewers. I think thisgame was way overhyped and I regret buying it.It does have amazing graphics, but under the hood it's aboring hack and slash button mashing game for the most part."
2,False advertising = one big let-down,"I agree with some reviewers that if you've played Prince of Persia, you've also played God of War. The story line is incomplete, the graphics are only sub-par (despite the glorious praises they have been recieving via rookie gamers) and the gameplay is utterly simplistic. This is a weak game, which is frustrating due to its limitless potential. I was glad I rented first and did not waste the money buying it."
5,God of Games?,"Quite possibly the best video game ever made. Super addictive. Makes you think a lot about some of the ""puzzles"" you are presented with, so it keeps you engaged, even though the game does take some time to complete. Even the extras are awesome (storyboards, what Kratos could've looked like, etc.) Would even make a pretty good movie too. Can't wait for a follow up."
5,Believe the hype!!!,"For all you non-believers out there, BUY THIS GAME! I was like you...reading the reviews, looking at the box in various stores, pondering, considering, thinking to myself, ""should I buy this game?"" Now that I finally spent the mere $20 and played the game, I am wondering why I didn't do so sooner. As an avid Playstation supporter, (Stood in line for hours and paid over $600 for my PS2 back in the day), this game contains nearly flawless gaming entertainment. Cinematically driven storyline, supurbly coordinated character control, creative levels and character design, great soundtrack, decent bosses, pretty cool power moves, and, (importantly), puzzles are not overly frustrating to the point of throwing your controller through the TV screen...except for maybe climbing the rotating spike columns. In closing, all I gotta say is the same thing I said my first sentence of this review...BUY THIS GAME!"
5,best game ever,"it's an excellent game. graphics, sound, gameplay, story... just perfect! i'm such a person who gets bored even her favorite games. i cannot play till the end of the game. GOW is one of the two games that i cannot quit/forget/bored/tired.. every parts of the game has different puzzeles/enemies/minigames/actions and it's getting more and more intersting on every step. you're fighting basicly with two blades ""blades of chaos"" chained to the very flesh of your arms. with a number of combos the fighting scenes are getting amazing. every boss has its unique minigame to beat, and they are so bloody violent."
4,PERFECTION !!!! ..... wait...wait a minute {sighs} not quite,"This game was great from the moment I opened it, all the way till the end. Everything positive you hear is indeed true. Great graphics,battle system ect. The only promblem with the game is that it has no replay value. When you beat it you unlock a ton of cool things, like the making of the game, but nothing to enhance the game experience. No new weapons, skills, and you don't keep any of what you had in your previous game. You can unlock new costumes but thats it.All and all its GREAT your first time through. Then I'd suggest letting your friends borrow it or trading it back in. Because the dungeons are fresh in your head, and you'll know exactly what to do if you play it again anytime soon."
3,"Almost solid, but a little over-rated","This is another game which re-invents the wheel so well that people forget that they've played better games before. It's very pretty, very loud, very violent...very all the things people like in games these days.At the same time it's camera is practically non-existent, it's controls are just okay, and the combat consists of as much button-smashing as you can whittle together. Sure, there are combos, but there's nothing particularly different about the way I play this and the way my niece ""Smash all the buttons at once"" plays this. By the time I advance far enough into the game where this starts to become more strategic, I'm already bored.If you're into the linear big boss fights-type stuff, knock yourself out. Me? I had more fun (and better control of the game) playing Psi-Ops and GTA. This is like a platformer on steroids. Very large, nigh-unswallowable steroids.Sidenote: T.C. Carson does the lead voice, and sounds good."
2,"too frustrating, not worth the trouble","hmm after constantly swearing at this game and punching the wall from dying falling off things and dying a billion times, i finally gave up. i was very near the end at zeus mountain where you fight harpies and archers on rollers and i just couldn't handle the stupid frustrating disappointment that is god of war anymore. the game started off pretty fun and innovative, but after a few levels it just disintegrated into a very uncool and boring 'hey let's make you jump from platform to platform oops you missed it your dead' type of boring wasteful blah game.AVOID"
1,WHAT IS ALL THE HYPE???,"This game is just not that great. You flail around. GTA (any of the series), or Hitman (same), or most sports games, blow this out of the water. Don't waste your time with this primitive game."
1,overrated and frustrating game,"it began ok but quickly devolved into a cra@ game. thankfully i rented on a gamepass and can trade this one in for something else because i can't believe how highly this game is rated, and how cra@@y this game really is. once you die falling off of stuff or swimming then the thing squishes you into the wall 5000000000 times you will understand what i am saying. this game blows."
1,Give us more!,Excellent Graphics and content.Far superior to the camera angle mishap that was Rygar.Difficulty level is an excellent feature.Start again where you die another excellent feature for a platformer.The only downer was that it took 15 hours to beat.
5,The best action game since Devil May Cry,"God of War is just unbeleivable. Playing the game is like playing devil may cry for the first time, it's a truly incredible experience. If you have a ps2 then buy this game immediatly. This game is an instant classic."
5,"The most amazing game I have ever played, HANDS DOWN!","""God Of War"" has brought the Action-Adventure genre to a whole new level and it looks almost unbeatable. With perfect graphics, an amazing storyline, tons of playability, intriguing and memorable puzzles, and its fascinating and accurate ties to Greek mythology help make this game the best game ever created. Anybody can pick this game up and learn how to play it in seconds; it is EXTREMELY player-friendly. Hell, even the music is great!As an awesome bonus, the game comes with a ""Treasures"" menu, which includes a documentary of the game's creation, trailers, deleted levels, and lots of other cool goodies and unlockables.Similar games like the ""Devil May Cry"" series, ""Prince Of Persia"", and others don't even come close to this game. This is worth getting the PS2 for!! BUY THIS GAME ALREADY! What are you waiting for?! I can tell you what I'm waiting for...A SEQUEL!!!"
5,Pure Sweetness,"This games rocks! Almost everything about this game is perfectGraphics are greatStory is greatgame play sweet tothe combo system is really amazingthe game is most like devil may cry, onimusha, and pronce of persiabut still i think this game is its own genreBesides the shear brutality in the game, and the excessive blood,gore and vilence, kratos is a nice guyhes just on a mission and doing his JOB very wellWell basicly this game is perfectonly flaw i really encountered was a little bit of lagging"
3,Good For It's Time,"If I played this 8 years ago, I probably would have enjoyed it a little a lot more. I gave up early on in the game because I got tired of going to the walkthrough for help. If your a long time fan then it's probably great, but it just didn't float my boat. Newer games with flashier graphics and smarter gameplay have corrupted me. This is probably a great game for the time, I just don't think it aged well over the years when compared to other games."
3,Drive you mad unless you have lighting reflexes,"Got the game, and took me a month just to get past the first boss. WHY? because It took that look to learn the sequence very little in the way of in game help. Then the rest of the game was a brease until I got to the last of posiden's challenges. Then it became insane, you couldn't pass it even though the sequence is child like. Your reflex's have to be so fast the game no longer becomes fun"
4,good condition,great for people who love the older generation games. Recommended for people who enjoy leveling and action type playing. My kids and husband like this.
4,God of War,Ok this is a fun game but it is to dang hard you have to walk around for hours just to solve one puzzle do good for about 30 minutes then solve another puzzle that is hard I would reccomend this to people who like hard core bloody/gory games but also like a challenge this is a good game to me just to hard to solve the puzzles. If you get this game we can have a discussion about it and I can give you hints.
5,"Gritty, gory, GREAT","Simply superb. This game offers intuitive game-play and immense enjoyment. This is an video game for adults, and the epic scale is something to appreciate.The fighting gets quite intuitive after a while, and the magic weapons system (though simple) offers enough options to remain interesting. Especially on the harder difficulties, the game rewards you for learning the combat system, and punishes you for mindless button mashing. Learning to BLOCK is required, which is nice. It is a change of pace for a game to require defense as a consideration.Pros: Exciting and action packed game that feels like you are playing an interactive movie.Cons: Only two bosses, enemies can be repetitive. Difficulty can change drastically from one area to the next, especially in the final stages.Conclusion: This should be on your ""Must Play"" list."
5,Darn that Hydra.,"This is a fantastic game all around. I'm still on the roof tops of Athens, grappling with the hanging vines. Thank goodness I whipped that Hydra. What a pain that was!The graphics, the soundtrack, everything is a top rate production. A few months from now, (as I'm a slow learner) I hope to finish and go on the God of War II.This is a game I will play again."
5,From the video game widow's point of view...,"My husband brought this game home and I thought, ""Oh no, I guess we're not having multisyllable conversations for the next few weeks..."" But to my surprise not only did he ABSOLUTELY love this game but I would sit next to him and watch, totally transfixed by the amazing detail and effort that the creators poured into this game. I caught myself saying, ""Baby, aren't you going to play your game?"" This game is incredible and while I am not at all a gamer I'm tempted to try it out! Everyone not shocked by gore (and I mean LOTS of gore) should play this game. Every game should be this well made."
5,believe in all the hype because this is a classic!,"great concept, great graphics, great sound, great gameplay, do you get it yet, this game is great!"
5,God of all Games,"This game is simply amazing. From the graphics to the gameplay it's pure adrenaline. It requires thought and strategy, so beware morons."
4,Frustrating At Times,"I enjoyed God of War. Things were frustrating for about 30 minutes, then the ganming experience was intense and fulfilling.Graphics wise, this game was awesome, but still fell a bit short of Shadow of the Colossus.The hardest part of the game wasn't necessarily the monsters, but more so trying to figure out how to move around the world. This game can leave you frustrated...very frustrated...at times with just trying to get from point A to point B. I almost quit early on when trying to figure out why the game wanted me to kick a crate. It kept breaking, and it was becoming very dull.But don't give up. You won't regret playing this."
5,OH MY GOD OF WAR!!!,"This game is incredible. It's also very challenging- don't expect to receive help from anyone, because you're on your own on this quest. the graphical capability of the ps2 is pushed to the farthest limits here, making the crumbling tombs, ruined temples, and rain drenched ships a sight to behold. The gameplay consists of decapitating two headed monsters, snake headed women, club wielding minotaurs, sword brandishing skeletons, and skyscraper sized sea serpents. the mood of the game is very brutal, violent, and angry. the cutscenes are almost movie-like in their vivid imagery. What more need I say? This game is a PS2 classic, and get it if you don't already."
4,Very good,"This game is very good though I would warn parents not to expose young children to it. It merits its rating as there are some suggestive sexual scenes and a good deal of blood splattering about. Sense I am a longtime online gamer and EQ spoiled me, please understand that a 4 star from me for a non online game is actually a 5 star!"
4,God of GORE!!!!!!,"This Game is AWSOME!!!!! It is way too graphic for kids so parents no matter how much they beg DON'T BUY IT! Even the story is too adult for them. It is a very interesting puzzle, action, and adventure game. If you are a occational gamer set it to easy and dig in because you can get the hang of it with a little practice. The puzzles require a little brain power so be ready for vex sometimes."
5,Looks Awesome!,"Checked for fit on k&n; website, and purchased this intake kit on Amazon.Got it installed on a 2008 Mustang V6.It looks so nice when you lift up the hood and there is a sparkling shiney intake!Also the end cap of the filter came polished too which looks good.It makes it sound a bit better too.Havn't ever dyno'd with an intake so can't say about any performance gains.It is just fun to have on the car for the looks and enhanced sound."
1,At His Best-Granada,"The fidelity on this CD did not do Mario Lanza's voice & talent justice. I was very disappointed at the ""thinness"" of the music quality, and also did not appreciate the applause after every number.I also have his ""Ultimate Collection"" and give it 20 stars."
1,Anything but Lanza's best,"Buyer be warned: this CD is simply a motley collection of performances from some of Lanza's weekly radio shows of 1951-52. Even the canned applause is included! Many of the renditions included here (Granada, O Sole Mio, etc) were much better sung by Lanza on other occasions.For an infinitely more enjoyable introduction to Lanza, I recommend the twofer CD Christmas Hymns and Carols: You Do Something To Me (available from Amazon)."
1,Performance Evaluations that Really Work,Did not receive in time - don't waste your money or your time. very poorly written.
4,Pretty Decent IM tribute,"I do believe this album to be different (for once, this is performed by spanish speaking heavy metal bands like Mago de Oz, Ankhara and such).BUT, mind the strrong spanish accent this is really good compilation.My favoorites:TrooperPhantomRevelationsAll in all, no harm done purchasing this album."
4,Spaniard Iron Maidens!!,"Really I enjoyed this tribute over others as it is singed, not barked. There are good arranges as those by Mago De Oz in Remember Tomorrow, and Dracon in Children of the Damned. In some the accent is ""different"", not mexican but very ""old world"".This could help you open your mind and look for other groups from Europe that cuold fill the gap left by some bands of yore."
3,First step,"This book is really good for beginner. RNA-Protein interaction in transcription, post-transcription and translation is really interest and important. So this book will be a guide for research which intrested in this mechanism."
2,Unacceptable side effects,"I got some of those ""Breathe Right"" strips you see ad. on TV because my nostrils are stuffed up or swollen enough so it's easier for me to breathe through my mouth at night causing very dry mouth, snoring, etc. It's true that these strips open up the passages and make it easier and comfortable to breathe through the nose, BUT I was left with a very red swollen nose (past 2 days), and a little area where the skin came off so it bled and left a small gash. Am afraid I don't appreciate the night-time effects enough to put up with the daytime side effects."
5,great aid for better sleep,"I have used these for awhile and now I wonder how I ever slept without them. If I didn't have them, I'd probably need to have surgery on my nose. Buying them through the Subscribe and Save program is the least expensive way that I've found of purchasing them."
1,imposters abound,"Sorry people this is false stuff. I am a Crow and this aint Crow, this is just another outsider trying to get rich off of tricking people. I don't even give it a star cuz it aint real!!! I had to choose a rating in order to post this."
1,Crow Tribe cultural director speaks out,"Before you buy this book, go to this website www.sonomacountyfreepress.com/features/brooke-edwards.html."
1,Commercialism,"I am very disappointed with this ""book"". And I use the term ""book"" loosely, it is really nothing more than one big commercial for her workshops."
4,Might be better,All in all this book is pretty good but the author does advertise an awfull lot for her own services and products.
4,Frommer's 2000 Alaska,"When planning a trip to Alaska, this book is an easy straight forward guide. It provides maps and info. divided by area of Alaska. It is a must for the first time traveler to this area."
3,Really a Spandex blend,"Okay, so I don't have the package in front of me, but I recall this as a blend, something like cotton, I believe. It doesn't have as much give as I thought it would, and it doesn't feel as nice as it might--it's more stringy than some more expensive large size fishnet hose I've bought. And there were some extra strings in between the patterns. I've gotten them off, and I think I managed to do so without ruining the hose, but I was a little surprised I had to do that, especially as much as I did. If you've not worn these large fishnets/fence/diamond patterns, it might take you a bit longer to put on than you'd expect, and it takes a while to unroll them, in fact. But they look great, very sexy, if that's the kind of thing your guy likes. For the price, a steal. These, BTW, are not crotchless. If you care."
4,A Welcome Addition to Craft Lit -,"I came to this anthology fresh from a beyond-words-awful book claiming to contain prayers for pagans. This was much more what I had in mind (remember Earth Prayers?). I don't like every single entry, and I found the use of quotations from the Charge as chapter titles inexplicably irritating. But overall, it's a lovely collection of spiritual and thoughtful moments. It's well worth the price, and I hope it will birth some spiritual children. This kind of collection is a welcome addition to a genre - the literature of the Craft - that spawns a lot of bad writing."
5,Wonderfully relaxing,"I am so excited about this book. I have read it cover to cover. Not only am I a reader, but I do have poems published in this anthology. I sank deeply into my arm chair and snuggled up with my cup of tea and my lap cat. I was taken on a journey that I dearly loved. What a beautiful way to spend a relaxing evening - nothing is better than poetry."
3,"It's okay, but you can't save your game.","Not really like scrabble, hard to win against the game. I prefer Bookworm for gameboy advance. You can save your game, and you can take your time."
3,It's a game with a twist,"You can say it's a game that is Tetris, Boggle and Dr. Mario mixed together to make words as quickly as possible."
3,Scrabble,I love this game! The only drawback is connection issues. It loses internet connection frequently. I know it is the app because all the other apps work fine.
4,The whole family loves it,"The game was sent promptly. My daughter loves it, in fact the whole family loves it."
5,Best gameboy game when own,"I got this game for myself while recovering from surgery. My 9 year old son picked it up and became just as addicted to it as I am. What is great is you can link up 2 gameboys and play against each other. I totally recommend buying the gameboy link if you buy this game. They are inexpensive and the multiplayer games are so much fun. I can say without doubt it has helped my child in spelling. My son even took the gameboy to his school conference and beat his teacher and principal!It is not traditional scrabble but a great series of games in which you have to find words, wither by trying to get a high score or by timed test.This is one gameboy game I can play for hours as an adult and so can my kids. My son plays the zelda and pokemon games for the gameboy but he also enjoys this game just as much."
3,Scrabble Blast,The game arrived in good condition but it's more for juniors than older kids or adults.
4,"The most extensive, detailed children's health reference.","This book has the most details of any children's health reference book I've seen. Each entry contains at least a paragraph dedicated to Description, Cause, Signs and Symptoms, Diagnosis, Treatment and Prevention, as well as additional sections such as Emergency Action and Complications, when they apply. I have four children's health reference books, and this one always has the most, and usually best, information of the group. I really feel it is best-of-breed. In addition to standard issues such as chicken pox, fever, croup, asthma and RSV, New Children's Health Encyclopedia also covers topics such as fire safety, trimming fingernails, mental health, and many adolescent topics. I find it to be a very comprehensive, valuable reference to have on hand."
4,Hitlers prisoners,"Interesting, but nothing about the time spent in prison. I would have liked to have heard more about the time spent there."
2,Talk Your Way Out of Credit Card Debt,My expectations were high as I have had incorrect charges and canceled downloads that Discover will dispute one month and put it back on the nextstatement. This was not helpful for me. Kathy
5,Good Book,"Following suggestions, one phone call got a 10% discount. But, since that's not good enough will transfer to competing 0 balance, still lower interest rate cards. Also, some helpful chapters at the back for dealing with disputes, calculating rates, etc.Book is concise, straightforward and well organized. Good information for anyone with a credit card to know."
3,Title is a little misleading,"It's a good book, but I think it should be called talk your way out of credit card fees. It did save me $48 on the annual fee on my credit card. I just had to ask and then politly threaten to close the account when they refused. They quickly agreed to refund the annual fee so it was worth the money just for that reason."
4,A helpful beginning,"I bought this and then returned it. While I think it would be helpful for many people, it was not as focused (in my opinion) for people over their heads."
3,Not what I expected,"While this book was very informative on dye and Chemical sensitivities, I was looking for a book that I could use start to finish diagnosing the possible cause and treating it. This book was just a selling tool for buying the actual program. We are on a tight budget, so this book was a waste of money for me since I cannot afford the program."
3,Mostly a marketing tool,"I'm intrigued by the Feingold diet, but haven't wanted to plunk down $75 to join the group to get all of the materials. The examples of diet on the website make it seem less useful to me. For example, we don't eat chips, ice cream, or juices so learning which brands are acceptable isn't helpful. However, I am concerned about food dyes and intrigued by the ""aspirin containing foods"" idea. I thought this book might be a middle step between knowing nothing and joining the society. To a certain extent it was. I learned a little bit more about foods to avoid, but I had to wade through repeated reminders that full information is available by joining the society. The book also lacks any disussion of the scientific basis for avoiding foods, particularly the aspirin containing foods."
5,Amazing!! Thank you - It was a prayer answered!,"The author must have been peeking through my window while writing this book! It was amazing; she described my child to a T. I had to try the diet. What did I have to lose, but a lot of stress, behavior problems and many hours spent on disciplining. Within the first week I saw a difference and in the second week I saw a new person! Thank you Jane Hersey for sending this ""Gift from God"" my way!"
4,7 Nanas,Very cute story about Jr. High student who is accidentally split ino 7 Nanas. Each Nana is a different aspect of the original Nana. Story line is about Nana's first love and her last year in Jr high school preparing for and taking High school entrance exams.
3,Couldn't tell much difference.,This product was supposed to equalize the volume between the program and the commecials. It did help a little but not much.
2,I like the concept but the toy is extremely cheap. Parts dont fit!?!?,I loved the concept of a Go Cart Vehicle so I ordered it.Unfortunately:1) The tires don't fit on the wheels well.2) The tools are TOO BIG for the tool box??? Only 1 out of 4-5 fits inside?3) The driver is almost too big for the seat and is sculpted terribly.Good points:Lots of cool accessories. The design of the go cart is pretty cool.
4,good resource,"The BCG guide was a good investment. The info is has is concisely presented, and it's a little bit of a different perspective from other guides out there.Also, unlike other university/grad school/law school guides, I don't feel I'm being talked down to by the authors. The format is SO clear that comparisons between schools are a lot simpler than they would be otherwise.Overall, a great resource, and I highly recommend it."
5,Fan of both the long handle and short handle,"I am a fan of both the short and longhandled Cobraheads. I do my gardening in Texas, where the soil gets very hard and dry. They are sturdy and durable and work really well and save my hands a lot of work. I use them for weeding, digging furrows, digging small holes, turning compost, and shaping beds. Aside from a shovel, rake, and small hand shovel, it's all I need."
1,Disappointed,I feel like I threw $25 away. It does not work any better than a regular weeder - even less well. I have a pesticide free lawn & garden. My garden is an English cottage garden & the thing is too big to weed closely growing flowers. I thought I could use it to dig up dandelions but it digs up too much of the lawn around the dandelion. It is way over priced for what it is.
3,Nabokov meets Mark Twain,"A clever idea by the author of the delightful 'Ella Minnow Pea.' But it doesn't quite come off. The mock-pedantic sophistication of Vladimir Nabokov meets the down-home humor of Mark Twain (there's even a reference to the 1910 appearance Halley's comet that marked Twain's death as it had his birth: Mark Dunn's homage to Mark Twain?). But Nabokov did it better in 'Pale Fire,' and Twain did it better every time he put pen to paper. The humor wears thin after about the first 100 pages, and becomes more and more irrelevant. At one point the book's putative author (one Mark Dunn, author Mark Dunn's fictional creation) wonders if the book has been over-researched. No, not really, but he DID throw in everything including the kitchen sink. Exuberance alone cannot a good book make.Nice try, but no brass ring this time."
4,Two year old loves this toy,"My two year old is fascinated with airplanes and loves this toy. It is a little difficult for her to push it hard enough for the friction to work, but that will change over time. Very durable."
2,"Less than a month, already broken","My kids love this toy. We received it at Christmas from a relative. The friction-motor part stopped working yesterday, less than a month after we received the toy. Customer service says I can return it to the store where I bought or ship it to them for repair or replacement. Since the toy wasn't purchased locally, I would have to ship it and I'm not sure it's worth the effort. Disappointing, considering these toys appear to be so well constructed. I probably won't buy anymore WOW toys."
5,Durable dumbbells - expected performance,"At my local Sports Authority store, I bought a pair of 35 lb dumbbells of this very brand. For the past two years these dumbbells have had great durability and coating doesn't chip off easily.The handle has a grid pattern which provides decent grip. The handle also does not burn my hands.Expected performance and I've no complaints whatsoever. Highly recommended"
3,Yup. Really does way 35 pounds. Does what it's supposed to do.,That paint you see on the numbers? Don't get too attached to it.For a more comfortable grip try wrapping the handle in pipe insulation with ducktape. Also make sure you have floor mats. These are usually a better deal than the rubber coated ones.
4,It is what it is.,Handle provides a nice grip. Perhaps the only downside is that you can't drop it on the ground after you're done working out like you can with rubber-coated dumbbells.
3,OK,"Does what it needs to. However, there are some very rough edges that can scrap your hands. Good product for the price."
1,Very bad quality,"I ordered four of these. For starters, the handles on the weights have metal shards so watch out or you'll get cut. As soon as I realized this I took them out to the shop and wrapped the handles heavily with duct tape. This will work ok but I certainly don't expect that from what is supposed to be a finished fitness product. Also, one of the dumbbells has a loose end. One of the hex heads slips up and down about a quarter inch. Since it's not worth the trouble to pack these back up and ship them, I'll just count this one as a live and learn. Should have just gone down to my local store for this one."
1,BROKE IN HALF,"It broke in half when I set it down. I have rubber flooring and don't drop the weight from a great height. I've been lifting weights for 20 years. I purchased on Dec 30, 2010 and used it about 2x a week. This is kind of scary. About to contact Amazon and possibly Manufacturer to see what they say about it. Will post an update."
1,HATE IT!,Completely defective! All metal is peeling off on handle causing razor sharp fragment to be imbedded in hand. Complete hazard and disappointment. This is a Law suit ready to happen. VERY UNHAPPY!!!
1,weight is off,I bought 2 of these dumbbells. One weighed 45 pounds the other weighed 48 pounds . Someone should checking these before they are shipped
1,Stiffed half the order,I ordered 4 10 pound Hex single Dumbbell's and only recieved 2. I have tried repeatedly to have my order remedied only to be met with silence. Will never order and and would not recommend to anyone!
3,As described but this is replacing a broken one,"I have the complete set from 5-20lbs but one of them broke in half. I had it on the bench and when I stood up I bumped the bench with my leg and the barbell fell and broke when it landed on my tile floor. Nothing happened to my floor, but the handle broke completely off about one inch from the end and turned it into two paper weights. So I bought this single barbell to replace the broken one. I am not sure what these things are made of, but I will make sure to be gentle with them and maybe buy some puzzle mats. Photo posted."
3,Share with others,"Chicken Wing is a perfect story for a child who is enthralled with Grandma and her cooking. What child isn't? Chicken Wing brings to life the love Mykala has for her grandma and for her cooking. Especially when she cooks her favorite dish, Chicken Wings. Her Grandma has nicknamed Mykala, ""Chicken Wing"" and it is so appropriate. Mykala even shares with others, which is a valuable lesson for people of any age to learn.Readability is to be noted. Chicken Wing has colorful illustrations that accompany the story and is sure to be enjoyed bybeginning readers. A cute second book by author Christine Young-Robinson, Chicken Wing is a welcomed addition to any beginning readers' library."
2,Story Time Lacks Credible Story,"While Edward Bloor's Story Time hits the target with its satire of the disturbing trend in U.S. schools of teaching for standardized tests, the book unfortunately lacks a strong plot to move it along. Bloor's voice and wit make this read tolerable, but the story never finds an identity, and fizzles out completely with a strange turn of events mid way through the books that tries to morph this satire into a fantasy/spook story that makes little sense. Fans of Tangerine shouldn't expect anything in the same league."
5,READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!! pleeeeeeeeeeeease,this book is for adventurous people. if you cant stand the way your teachers fret about the standerdised test and think they take it to the extreme then this is the book for you. i loved and i bet you will too. so.........READ THIS BOOKsigned5 star book fan
2,Story time,"First off, I was surprised by the number of mistakes that should have been caught by the proofreader/editor. Simple spelling errors are truly unforgivable when you start noticing more than one or two in a published book. I was beginning to think I had somehow gotten one of the ""free"" books from Amazon, instead of a library loaner. The whole thing smacked of a vanity press piece.I enjoy stories that are fantasy, but this one was lacking in many ways, mainly not enough fantasy! The storyline was at times irritating and rambling, with a lack of wit that possibly would have saved it. Not in my top 1,000 ."
5,Sparkling Satire for Young Adults,"This darkly sparkling satire on the foibles of the American education system is not at all what we'd typically expect from a YA novel. While brighter and somewhat less acidic than Lemony Snicket's unfortunate oeuvre, the characters herein soar not only in Peter Pan-esque bravado and elan, but also in smartly targeting right on its turgid mark. When combined, a haunted library, completed with way quirky librarians; a family where eccentricity and egomania are a long-standing and requisite condition, and lots of goofy fun weirdness make for an incredible reading experience. While this would be a great addition to the ""while we're waiting for the next Potter/Snicket/Funke/Paolini, etc."" list, there's a lot here for reluctant readers and generally fans of the kooky. This would also be great for classroom use in teaching the joys of satire."
1,STORY SLEEP,THIS WAS THE MMOST BORING BOOK THAT I HAVE EVER READ. I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS TO ANYBODY.IT IS CONFUSING AND DID I MENTION BORRING.P.S. MS.D PLEASE DON'T TAKE OFF MY GRADE SPELLING ERRORSSIGN_THE BOY WHO DIDN'T LIKE STORY TIME
5,B-more's Finest,"This great literary work takes you deep inside the lives of two hardcore drug dealers on the streets of Baltimore. (Or Bmore, as those who live here affectionately call it).Throughout this book you will be longing to know what becomes of it's characters. It will make even the most logical and rational person root for the ""bad guy"". This book shows you exactly what a thug is and what a thug isn't. Some stereotypes are sure to be broken by the time you're finished. All hail Thomas Long as he takes you deep undercover in the ""game"" and doesn't allow you to leave until the last play has been called and there's no time left on the clock!To the author, Thomas, I really admire your work and I look forward to reading more like it very soon!Ms. WilsonThe Page Turnas BookclubFounding Member"
5,Thug's Life,"A Thugs Life is like a fast paced rollercoaster ride into the life and times of two young drug dealers, Dayvon and Ty both taught the drug game by Ty's uncle Will an old time drugdealer. The book rolls smoothly along the drug infested streets of B-more and gives you an inside look at the world of two friends who grew into manhood dealing drugs together.Both young men make difficult and heart stopping choices. One goes to jail and the other tries to find a better life without dealing drugs. A Thugs life, is an exciting book from thefirst to the last page that keeps you hanging on to every word."
3,Same Story Different Author,"I thought this book was ok but not spectacular. It could be because I am just reading too many ""thug tales"" at one time. This genre will be just about dead if someone doesn't step it up and put a new twist on the same old story. Drug dealer lives it up, has millions of women, wakes up and realizes he wants out, loses family and crew in the process. How many ways can you tell this story? I think I'll have to put these types of books down for a minute. Buy this only if you haven't read other books just like it or just want a quick read of drugs, sex, and murder."
5,A Thug's Life Never Ends...,"Dayvon, coming from an upper middle class family, is not your typical drug dealer/hustler with a sad story. Dayvon and his siblings came from a respectable family that raised their kids to be educated and to have values and morals. Dayvon goes left on his family, and chooses to befriend classmate, Ty.

3,If you were looking for an easy way to learn Hebrew ...,"This book is easy to read and instructions are easy to follow. However, it was slightly simplistic in the approach it took to teaching the language and failed to explore more advanced parts of the Hebrew language. I did find it helpful however and with perseverence, you will learn enough Hebrew to get by in a conversation."
3,Okay,very beutiful watch I just have trouble seeing the hands because they blend in with the back ground
3,disappointing end to epic series,"The final book in the final volume of Powell's monumental series (Book 3 of Winter). Wow, it has been a long time getting through this epic collection. The characters are older, not necessarily wiser, by this time. Clear separation in attitudes between Jenkins and the younger set as represented primarily by Murtlock and Fiona. At the core of this is the utter self-destruction by Widermpool. Cults and weddings as the backdrop, this is perhaps more varied than the earlier books, but without as much humanity. To me, this failed in truly explaining why Widmerpool took such drastic measures, and also in why Jenkin's interest in Widermerpool had changed to almost indifference. The persistent observer throughout this series, suddenly Jenkins was inclined to walk away from disturbances.I think the core story could have been done justice in 3 or 4 books rather than 12. I have no regrets over spending time on this, but doubt I would ever venture a second pass at it."
5,Great Book!! Buy it!,The book is just Excellent source of informations if you are planing to take your lactation exam. Easy to understand and very complete. The shipping was very fast and well packed!.Thank yohttp://www.amazon.com/review/create-review?ie=UTF8&ref;_=oh_rev_o01_s00_i00&asin;=0763745855
5,A GREAT 30 MINUTES!,My husband and I got this video and we were sweating in the first 10 minutes! We did this video yesterday for the first time and I was very happy with it. I'm honestly sore today! Now I do have to say that we do not work out on a regular basis. I do recommend this video. They explain the exercises and there are the variations for people who are not advanced. It's only 30 minutes and it is over before you know it!
4,Good work-out in a short time,"I am very picky when it comes to exercising, especially with all the DVD's out today. I actually like this video, it teaches balance and control without taking an hour! I do recommend this to anyone who has a ball and is looking for something short. The leading lady encourages you to keep up without being annoying. She has an accent and speaks calmly to keep you focused. I really enjoy it!"
5,Good addition to my library,"Great work-out, needs only a small area to use. Good toning for abs, legs and upper body. Some use of weights for upper body. Kelli Roberts makes workout easy to follow.I use it 2 times a week to supplement my other ball and yoga videos.Glad I bought it"
3,"Down to earth but too fast, too short.","The positives -- Kelly Robins is so real; the other two in the DVD are real too. The viewer feels like she's at home when she works out with these women who could live right next door and not in Hollywood. Also it's awesome to watch the timer on the lower left corner tick down the minutes.However, they lift weights at a very quick pace. Professional trainers have told me (I wouldn't know) that lifting slowly increases effectiveness so... this might not be as effective."
3,Eah,"Im sure this work out is fine for more experienced ball users but just trying to balance on the ball takes up most of my time; so Im not really getting the work out. Also its a little boring to me, but i think ive been spoiled by the 10 min solution, and belly dance and hula workouts."
3,I was looking for all ab workouts,"I thought this entire DVD was 3 different ab workouts, but it's not. The one ab workout on it is okay, but not the best that I've seen."
1,WASTE OF TIME,I dont know how anyone could sweat w/ this workout unless they were terribly unhealthy. This is easier than chewing. Waste of money and time.
5,Good workout,"This is one of the better stability ball workouts I have seen. I have a couple of otheres, but they are pretty wimpy. This one really works your muscles. Some of the moves are kind of tough though, so be careful the first time around. I fell off my ball on one of the moves!!"
4,Wow!,"I thought I was going to breeze right through this DVD, so I was surprized at how intense and challenging it was! Some of the moves are extremely difficult to master, because you truly have to learn to balance yourself - which takes alot of coordination and strength. But this is what I love about it. I love DVDs that I have to go through a few times before I can master it. My only complaint, like some others have noted, is that it is too short. I wish the Quick Fix series had at least 4 or 5 segments. I just don't feel like I get enough of a work-out in thirty minutes. I usually only do this DVD when I'm really crunched for time."
2,Stability Ball Workout,Was not what I expected. It does not spend enough time on any particular area of the body to really work it.
4,I'm a fan of the Quick Fix workouts!,"This is one of the good ones. I enjoy working out with the ball and I feel like I get a decent burn.The instructor moves quickly and, like many others have said here, there is no warm-up or cool-down. I find myself often pausing to stetch out between excersises.I pull this DVD out weekly."
4,Recommend,This DVD is very good for working on the stability ball. The instructor is easy to follow. Good for the beginner and intermediate user.
5,Get on the ball!,"Using a ball is an effective way to do exercises that otherwise put a lot of stress on your joints when done on the floor. The reviewer who said that this is a waste of time has obviously not done the exercises properly. It is also not accurate to say that someone would have to be very unhealthy in order to sweat. Just because you don't sweat, doesn't mean you are not working hard. I work out all the time, and still feel challenged when using the ball. I have used stability balls in exercise classes, and most people also agree that they are very useful. Using a ball takes the weight off your joints, which allows you to focus on doing the exercises properly without hurting yourself. Having to stabilize your ""core"" also works the muscles harder. Don't be fooled at how easy it looks. Once you try it, you will notice your muscles working."
5,Very Pleased,"Previously I was working out to the Core Secrets dvd with Gunnar Peterson. I find that the Quick Fix Stability Ball workout is significantly more challenging. There is a great variety of different workouts that really engage the whole body. In the mornings, I usually do two of the workouts for 20 minutes. If I'm running late, I just do one ten minute segment, and that helps me to stick to my routine, otherwise, I would just skip working out altogether. Whether separate or together, anyone will find these workouts challenging, effective, and they hold your interest."
5,one of my favorites,"I love the whole series.Good strengthening DVD. Love that's it quick. You still need to do your cardio someplace else, but for toning...it's great!! I have had this video about 6 years and have not tired of it.Love the exercises on the ball, very gentle to the body and the modifications are very do-able. Kellie is great too. Perfect for the time challenged!"
4,I love the ball!,"I wanted a ball for the longest time, when I recieved one as a shower gift I was so happy! But how do you use a ball? The video that came with it was not very informative and I did not feel I was getting a good workout. So I bought this video. It may only be 10 minutes a session but you feel it!I would definatly recommend this to anyone who loves the ball."
5,Great organizational tools!,Friends and Family consider me to be a professional shopper. Personally I am just an organized well informed shopper. I purchased these pages and the 9 pocket pages for sorting and organizing coupons. These pages in a binder are great for more than just collecters cards. This particular brand is of good quality as well. Much better than other brands that I have found to be made of cheaper thin plastic that tear easily. I have haven't had any issues with tearing with this brand. So if your a coupon savy shopper like myself then these are great for organizing your coupons.
1,Cheap product for not-so-cheap price,"We purchased our brother printer less than two months ago. From the get-go, we had issues, but mostly when we tried to use cardstock. The printer/copier consistently jams, and yesterday the paper feeder broke completely. Customer service has been non-responsive.The price was cheap, but not that cheap. Other printer/copier/scanners in the same price range do not self-destruct within six weeksI do no recommend this nor this company."
4,Good product,"I bought this 3-in-1 printer for home use. It is easy to install and very easy to use. It prints fast and the quality is excellent. The toner is comparatively cheaper than other brands. I strongly recommend buying this product either for home or office use. The only thing I regret is that I should have bought a 4-in-1 printer with fax function. Anyway, it is a good printer."
3,"Good for the price, but some flaws","I chose this for the price, mainly, and there are some things that you have to deal with in exchange for its low cost. First, when you print multiple pages, they get gummed up in a hurry (less than 10 pages will do it) and your document comes out in a mangled mess on the floor. You therefore have to be present for each print job and take each page out as it comes. Also, I have a Mac and had some serious confusion on how to get it to scan and to where on the computer the file arrived. Customer support was friendly (but a long, long wait for Mac customers) and got the problem solved.All in all, it's solid, but with shortcomings."
5,I love this printer,Ofcourse i don't have any complex things to print. But it's very good and fast. Easy to print. This is very good for the home office.
2,Buy the better model,I highly recommend the MFC-8820DN instead of this model. It's about a hundred $$ more and it includes automatic duplexing (that's the 'D' in the model #) and it includes a network interface (that's the 'N' in the model #). The 8xxx models use high capacity cartridges which means about seventy bucks for > 6000 pages instead of fifty bucks for about 2000 pages for the 7xxx models. Think about it. After just a couple toner cartridges you'll have paid for the better machine!I didn't buy mine on Amazon as they don't sell that model. I don't know why - it's much better IMHO.
1,Returned to Amazon,The product would not initialize within the first 3 steps. Amazon handled the return to my satisfaction. Thank you.
3,NOT NETWORKABLE,"Please read the review by ""Han32some"" carefully. It is a review for the 7820N which is a much more expensive printer featuring ethernet connectivity. The description of this printer above is incorrect. The printer features USB2 and Parallel ports, but no ethernet port."
1,utter garbage,"DOES NOT COME w/ scanning software for Mac and thus will not work unless you buy 3rd party software. This info is buried deep deep in users guide on the cd rom, which is almost unreadable. The cheapest sub $100 canon or hp scanner/printer--comes with mac software. What is brother's problem? Even with borrowed software, I could not get it to work on my G4, and I've been taking computers apart since they before they had hard drives."
2,"Nice Printer, But....","This printer works well, was reviewed well online, and does exactly what it is supposed to. The problem is the software, it's a NIGHTMARE. I always have to fight to get it to print. Either you let windows install the printer, or use the driver on the cd, and when you print you just get an error message, and have to reboot the computer to get it to print, OR you install all the unnecessary software made for servers, send it to print in the ""paper port"" program, then have to tell that program to print it. Either way if you buy this printer you can no longet in 1 quick step print your pages.Oh and by-the-way, I use windows XP Home so nothing outdated, but noticed it works a little better with XP Pro."
1,Do not buy from this seller,"Do not buy from this seller. The product was poorly packaged. The printer jammed on almost all copies. The drum needed to be replaced. I emailed the seller and she did not respond at ll. I had to pay postage of over $36.00 to return the item. This was a complete disaster, costing me time and money and I ended up with nothing."
3,Mostly good...,"I've been using this copier for several years for a small business. The only problem I've ever had is that if you need to make a copy of a carbon copy it doesn't come out dark enough and you can't read the copy no matter how dark you set it. Otherwise, it's fast, the toner goes a long way, and I haven't had many issues with paper jams."
4,good copier,"I am using this device as a stand alone copier. I will use it as a printer, scanner back-up to the equipment I already have. Setup was easy, the auto feed works as advertised and I have not experienced a paper jam so far. Two sided copies are not possible because of the curl in the paper after one pass thru the copier, but I suspect that is the norm for lazer copiers. Overall, I like the unit."
1,Feeder fails,The copier worked for 3 months. Now the paper will not feed properly. A total nightmare for our office. Never heard people cursing at a copier before!
2,Awkward design,"I regret buying this printer. The main, persistently annoying problem is the odd place that Brother has placed the ""output"" tray. Check out the photo: It's the higher of the two slits on the front. Even with the scanner tray up, there's very little room for printouts to occupy. So for documents longer than 30 pages (or if you have some pages sitting in your output tray already) the printer begins to push them out of the tray and onto the floor (or all over the room). This also leads to frequent jams (sometimes the paper can't push its way out.) Reason enough to go another route."
1,not for office use,"This is great for people who don't use a printer very often. Basically, this is a toy. It works fine until its first paper jam, and then you're in for some ""fun"". Allow yourself 30 minutes to figure out that the error message you are getting (""BACK COVER OPEN"") has nothing to do with the back cover actually being open, because it isn't. . . . Get it ? If you need a printer for ""adult"" use (medium to heavy), buy something else. Otherwise, this is fine."
1,DO NOT BUY A PRINTER FROM BROTHER,"This printer worked fine for 3 months. Then I replaced the cartridge with another Brother cartridge, which leaked all over the inside of the machine and damaged the drum. When I called the warranty department, I was told that because I took the printer to a repair center without Brother's authorization, they would not honor the warranty. Another Brother printer that I purchased several years ago also lasted only a few months before breaking. There's a reason Brother products are cheap - they are JUNK, and the company does not honor its warranties. My advice - buy a Lexmark instead."
1,No generic supplies!,Do not under any circumstances buy a Brother printer. They rig the machine so that it will accept no generic toners. You use a brother toner or the machine won't work. Amazing!
2,Find another super cheap printer,"For some reason, this printer can't print more than 12 pages without become a paper disaster, papers go flying all over, and eventually the thing jams. Pretty crappy, really."
3,Light Works as advertised but has limited distance,"The light is not as bright as i thought it woud be, and does not activate unless you are within 20 feet of it."
5,this country should know him by name.,"jurado goes back to the stripped down version of his songs and it pays off nicely. although it lacks the heartache that ghost of david had, it gives us jurado fans 10 great songs; each dripping with the that trademark sweet jurado sadness. where shall he take us next? it really doesn't matter as long as he's at the wheel."
4,Good,"This is a good album and Abilene is in my opinion one of his best songs. Even still, if I had to compare it to his others I would put this one at the bottom of the pile. If your a fan you'll love it."
2,cambridge tempered glass pitcher,"I looked a very long time on the internet and in stores for the right glass pitcher. I chose this pitcher because of the handle, size and base. When I rec'd the pitcher I was disappointed. The handle was a little different than the picture, and the glass was cloudy, not clear. I have always been very happy with purchases from amazon and will continue to buy from amazon."
3,Adequate cable management system,"If you have a small, rack mounted environment with 10 or 15 cables and you won't need to re-wire anytime soon, then this is a decent system which works. If you have more cables, have to rewire periodically, need access to a particular cable every once in a while or will need to add a cable every once in a while, this system is a bit of a pain to work with. It is difficult to track a cable and remove it once it is installed and the plastic fingers don't hold cables properly if you use all 24 slots."
1,Waste of Time,"Uzzel borrows liberally from previous research and writing on Jefferson while supplying very little of his own. I didn't learn anything new about Jefferson from reading this, nor will any other decently informed blues fan. There is absolutely zero analysis of BLJ's songs or musicianship, nor any attempt to place him in the context of his times. Uzzel knows nothing about other bluesmen, so he abstains from potentially insightful comparisons to BLJ contemporaries in Texas and Mississippi. There is no discography, so the reader is left guessing at exactly what, when, and where BLJ recorded his tunes. All in all, a vacuous read and a waste of everyone's time and money."
5,A Great Introduction to a great singer,"The title track - Concerto Per Patty is a 12 minute concerto written especially for Ms. Pravo. In it she shows the entire range of her very emotional and effective voice. It is a unique masterpiece of 60's Pop Music. Also included on this CD are some wonderful tracks including the singles Il Paradiso , Tripoli '69 and Un Giorno Come Un Altro which is a cover of the Bee Gee's classic First Of May. And two wonderfully produced album tracks Sola In Capo Al Mondo and Un'Ora Fa. Also included is the instrumental With A Little Help From My Friends featuring Patty on piano with some help from John Lennon. All in all a great masterpiece of Italian Pop."
5,Very good read found at Amazon,"This book is an excellent read for the nonprofessional who simply wants to get a good overview of some of the most interesting characters of the Italian Renaissance. Very easy, informative and entertaining study. Provides a good general coverage of the people and the times. Even though I have read the more extensive biographies I found this to be a very enjoyable review .... sort of a Sportscenter highlites type."
1,very disappointed,"I expected some damage, but this is more severe than I expected. Two corners are badly smashed and the box is out of square. The result is that the other two corners do not join together very well. I will have to square it up with some clamps, reglue it, and repaint. It wasn't worth the lower price."
5,Works well so far,"I have used it only few days now, no problems with cleaning or rust yet, and works well with all size lids."
5,Simple device - very practical use!,"How can you improve a spoon rest!? It does one task - holds a hot spoon from dripping all over your counter top. Progressive however were able to improve the basic spoon rest!The fact that you have a place you put the lid of a hot pot is perfect. Holds all type of lids - from a basic SSteel to cast iron, no problem.Very happy w/purchase."
4,Best idea ever,"I can't believe this is the only lid/spoon rest combo I've ever come across--it's such a great idea. It comes in handy every time I cook and if it gets messy, I just put it in the top rack of the dishwasher and it cleans up fine (also easy to hand wash in a pinch). It works well with heavy glass and stainless steel pot lids, but I would definitely not try to use it with a cast iron lid--it's just not sturdy enough for that. Otherwise, though, it's a really smart upgrade from your standard spoon rest. No more hot, hot water or soup running down your hand when you pick up the lid to stir!"
1,Can't be assembled,"The wing nuts that are supplied are too large to engage the thread on the vertical support, making the product impossible to assemble. So, you can either make a trip to a hardware store to purchase correctly sized wing nuts, as I did, or you can just throw the thing in the garbage, which would be a lot easier."
5,Great present that will be used every day!,"I bought this for myself although it sat on my wish list for over a year. The spoon rest can also be used as a lid rest but no more putting steamed up or greasy lids on my counters or range top. I've had it for over a year now and it's so easy to clean, dry and pull it out again the next day. The only thing I haven't tried it with is my very, very biggest glass lid but so far all other lids are perfectly stable on this."
5,Progressive Spoon Rest,Product works great. Cleans up nice. Makes great gift to a kitchen head. Big lids stand up and don't take up so much room on stove or counter.
2,It would be nice if it had all its parts.,"It arrived without the two stainless steel nuts that hold the vertical lid holder to the bottom piece. It isn't worth the hassle to return. I really wish that country of origin were part of the product description, so I could avoid the lack of quality control that goes with, ""Made in China""."
2,Spoon Doesn't Stay Put!,"This product works great for placing a lid in the upright position. However, the slot for the spoon does not work at all if your spoon is made of any solid, smooth material. My metal, plastic, and wood utensils that I use for cooking simply slide to the side because the top portion of this product is straight. This has made for many a frustrating night and I don't use the product at all anymore."
3,"Nice design, poor quality","I bought this item after having purchased an Amoco Spoon Rest:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000VLCBK/ref=oss_productI wanted something to hold a pot lid. This item has a nice design, but build quality is poor. The stainless is thin compared to the Amoco and there are rough edges and tooling marks, especially on the two concave edges of the spoon rest area. The Amoco is finished nicely, and is quite a bit larger in comparison. This item is a bit undersized for large spoons and ladles. If you can live without the lid holder, buy the Amoco."
4,great idea!,This handy spoon/lid rest is such a great idea! The lid rest catches any drips coming off the lid and the spoon rest part is big enough for any spoon. I also use it when I have no lid to rest. Good deal for the money.
2,Not a winner,This spoon rest/lid holder works well as a spoon rest but the lids I have won't stay up on the lid holder. It seems well made but not well designed. I could not recommend this item.
3,Rust problem,"Actual spoon rest is functional, however rust builds up around the holes and wing nuts. So much for stainless steel. Disappointing!"
5,Super Fun!,THis video is super huge fun because these ladies are having such a grand time. They are very much in touch with their inner child who is happy and not afraid to show it or shy to be dancing on camera. I will buy more by these ladies or rent it at my local library. They dance slower on this tape and it is easier to follow along with them. The guys in the video are so much fun to watch also. It is a 5 star dvd andthe set is beautiful!
4,good sampler,"The other reviewer's words notwithstanding, much of the material on this sampler is *not* from the pre-Pentangle period of John Renbourn's career (i.e., circa 1965-1967) but instead from ""Sir John Alot,"" ""Faro Annie,"" and others that were produced during (and even after) his Pentangle years. But these are just details. What you do get here is a broad sample of material from Renbourn's first seven or eight years of recorded music, and it's a good sample that shows just how effective he is at taking material from diverse sources and putting his own personal stamp on it. Renbourn is a real virtuoso performer, but his approach never lacks musicality or warmth. I can't ever remember getting a negative reaction from anyone I played John Renbourn material for."
5,Description,Novel set in 14th-century England including the 1346 Crecy campaign and the Black Death.
4,C2G comes with some more handy cable managers,"Picked up one of these for a network closet clean up and similar to their horizontal CM's I like the plethora of clips and the way the face plats attach as they allow me to get more cables, tighter without worry that the cover will pop off. As long as you are stronger than the cables, these things will hold tight! All this and they are simple to install and hold tight!"
1,what the ??!?!?!?,"Ok, this is my 1st review ever to write on here, but I figured what better time to start? I am a very big fan of Nickelback BUT I agree, this is not a tribute....ITS HORRIBLE. This guy needs to get a real job and stop trying to sing bc I honestly don't think he's ever gonna make it. Sorry guy but this is torture."
4,Hard to find songs in one place.,"As a mobile D.J., I've found the ""Strip Jointz"" series of compilations very helpful (my wife doesn't appreciate the cover art or the concept, but...). If you're a fan of R & B or rap music, these include some very hard to find selections all on one CD. I bought this one for ""Baby Got Back"" by Sir Mix A Lot, ""Dazzey Dukes"" by Duice and ""Give It To Me Baby"" by Rick James. Great to throw on as background at a party, too!"
1,Dont make same mistake i did,"Not worth the money at all, although it was just a dollar. the shipping cost was ridiculous, as well as the cover itself. Without any previous warning I was giving a bright orange basketball book cover."
2,GREAT CONCEPT,"THE CONCEPT IS GREAT, JUST DONT LIKE THE FACT CANT CHOOSE WHT PATTER OR COLORS I WOULD WANT. I GOT THIS FOR MY NEPHEW AND I WAS SENT PURPLE FLOWER DESIGN.."
5,Best of Schoolhouse Rock,My daughter needed to learn the Preamble for school and was having problems learning it because it happens to be quite lengthy. I remembered hearing it when I was a little girl on tv and singing along with it which made it much easier to learn. She got extra credit for being the first to learn it in her class and we let the teacher know that the cd was available if they needed it for other children in the class.
5,I love Schoolhouse Rock!,"I can't believe I found this. Almost everyday in math class, I find myself using my 3s timestable and thinking of the Multiplication Rock song. And in Lit, I am constantly humming Conjunction Junction. I thought I'd never hear my favourites from Schoolhouse Rock again...forget that. I'm so getting this CD!!!"
4,"4.5 stars, original artists","Best of SchoolHouse Rock! Audio CD: Original titles from orignial recordings. Also recommended for those car rides where you can sing along with your kids. My oldest has not been exposed for a week yet, but already can sing several in parts. Rating: 4.5/5This is the collection of ""some of the SchoolHouse Rock songs made throughout the 70s and 80s. I think it is great from a nostalgic and educational point of view. Although, looking back on it I never realized in my innocent days there was a touch of Marlo Thomas boy-bashing in it. Dr. James Dobson wrote an excellent book called ""Bringing Up Boys"", which I would recommend to any Mom or Dad. Read this book, and you will see subtle colorations in SchoolHouse Rock! that put boys down. Nonetheless, I do like it for the basic education components, and I remember many of those songs (even before we bought this, I was teaching my kids the '3' times tables with the '3 is a magic number' song)."
3,Should have read the list of songs before,"I recently bought this CD, I like most of the songs but once it gets to wall street it goes downfall for me.Why oh why do my kids need to know how large the national debt is? The song's lyrics are so political I'm still in disbilief plus none of those (14 and on) songs were in the original series.Anyway now I just have to stop the CD before song 14 starts... I have no one to blame but myself, I should have read that song list plus lyrics!"
3,Missing Too Many Good Songs,"It's a good album and for those of us that grew up eagerly awaiting Saturday morning cartoons; it's a great disc. It had been a while since I had heard many of these songs and have been amazed at how well crafted the songs are to the point I've found myself singing them at work.I originally bought the disc to share with my 2 year old son and I'm happy to say he loves them, especially ""Conjunction Junction"" and ""Interjection.""My only complaint is that the compiler that formulated the list of songs opted to include songs spanning the years of School House Rock instead of including the Best songs. There are many songs that are missing that are simply better and more likable than songs like ""Tyrannosaurus Debt.""What happen to Rufus Xavier Sasparilla?"
3,Is the best really the 'Best of the Best'?,"I did think that for the most part there is a good selection on this CD. Most os the ones you remember from your childhood like 'I'm just a Bill' and 'Interplanet Janet' are here. But there were a few I loved that didn't make it such as 'Ready or not, here I come' (multiplying by 5s) and the unforgetable love classic 'The Tale of Mr. Morton'. The last 4 tracks are only put on here so you would have to buy this CD plus the 'complete' recording CD to actually get the complete recordings. Those 4 songs are not on the 4 CD set. In my opinion, those 4 are actually pretty low on the scale of good School House Rock songs. As for the quality, it is better then the actual music videos.A little effort was put in to make them sound really good."
4,Smiles,"Very pleased -- Wish it had a few more songs like ""lolly, lolly ,lolly"". But over all it is GREAT."
1,puppy chewed off pieces,"My 3 month old cockapoo loved this toy. However, after just 2 days of light use, he chewed off both tips of the fish's tail. I can only assume he swallowed them. I just hope the pieces were small enough to pass though his system without any damage. I don't understand why toys made specifically for chewing are not made to be more durable. I would never give a child a toy that had pieces that might break off and be swallowed, and now I'll surely pay more attention when choosing my puppy's toys as well."
2,"Eh, Initial Interest, Now Forgotten","The best thing I can say is that it's cute to see a small puppy carry the fish around, but he completely lost interest in one day. Plus, he immediately tried to chew off the hard corners of the tail - not so good. I cut them off with kitchen shears. I would not buy this again."
2,fluffy,"Not enough in-depth material to appeal to advanced programmers, and lots of padding. Unclear depiction of concepts for beginners. Misleading about thread scheduling and priorities."
1,Frustrating,"I've tried to give this book every chance. But always find myself rushing to Chan & Lee, to get things straight. This is not a book where you will learn much about Java multi-threading. The examples are confusing, and it's difficult to use the book as a reference."
1,Extremely dissapointed,"This book is indeed the worst book I have ever read from O'Reilly concerning Java programming. In fact I am considering donating my copy to a local garbage dump.The examples are not relevent to real life programming. And worst of all, after spending much time and energy painfully plowing through their poor explanations, they end the excercise by telling me that what they just taught me ""won't work"".Spending most of my time learning what ""won't work"" is not how I normally learn. In fact, I don't think that is how most people normally learn. It only succeeded in frustrating and discouraging me. Just tell me what will work and I will learn it and we will all be happy."
4,Great introduction to Java Threads!!!,"What I learned in the first four chapters, helped me resolve some dead-lock and race conditions I was experiencing in my programs. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the book!"
2,Java Threads,"Book provides basic useful information. Other than that, some of the contrived examples and sample classes are bad and wrong. Some of the stuff will not even work. The utility classes like TargetNotify are not useable. It would be better if they had tried to use them in some sample programs."
2,Could be much better,"This is a prettry decent book on threads, but I frankly found it to be a little flat. The writing doesn't exactly pop and it is a pretty small book. I think they could easily write a book about twice the size and cover the topic entirely.However, if you are new to multithreading, or at least new to Java threads, this is a great intorduction to the subject. And it is very difficult to find a lot of information on Java threads anyway, which is why I bought this book in the first place. There are some very practical code examples too, including a round robin scheduler."
3,Possible second read on Java Threads.,"Obviously your first read on Java should be ""Concurrent Programming in Java(TM): Design Principles and Pattern"" by Doug Lea. If this does not completely satisfy you this might be a possible second read on the subject. This book has a somewhat different perspective that it is closer to the classes and more distant to the principles. Here it delivers a good groundwork."
1,Shakes my faith in O'Reilly,This is not a useful book. Over and over again I found myself re-reading passages in a desperate attempt to understand the concept being presented.
1,insubstantial and wrong,This is a very poor book. Contrived and just plain wrong in places. Not worth reading.
1,This book blows!,"I started reading it for the second time, and it stinks! I'm just gonna put it down and spend some more money. It was a twisted learning experience, not worth a cent."
4,great....goes by fast,"this video isn't for those who aren't already somewhat familiar with pilates....it's hard to follow at first if you don't know the basic pilates moves.other than that, i thought it was a great video. it always leaves my sweating and it goes by really fast because of the timer on the bottom. keli's encouraging and helpful, but not over-ethusiastic. i hate cheerleader-like trainers. i've only been doing it for about a month and i'm seeing some great results."
2,Importance of packaging,"Very simple. Product ok. Distributer used not. The video was packed in a simple plastic back. No protection whatsoever. Surprise, surprise, upon arrival, although the DVD was still intact, the box was completely shattered."
5,Does what it says,"This is an excellent DVD, but here are a few pointers for prospective buyers before you try this one out -Though there is some good encouragement on basic pilates principles (breathing, etc.), this is not a basic workout. Once you get about five minutes into the first segment, you start jumping into intermediate/advanced moves.Second, the format is great in that you can have three separate workouts or one thirty minute, but if you are in good shape, you are probably going to want more, and pilates hard-core nuts are going to want something more whole-body. For example, this would work well to use it like I have - after weightlifting at the gym and use this for your core/ab stuff.So, great for the time crunch, a bunch of concentrated intermediate/advanced pilates in a short period of time. Does what it says, a quick fix."
3,GOOD FOR THOSE NEW TO PILATES,"I think this is a good workout for beginners. It gives solid instruction on correct form and breathing. I love the Quick Fix Total, but did not find this one challenging enough."
4,Toronto band makes hook-laden garage rock monster!,"With Hot New Spirits, the Tangiers have reached the boundaries of the garage rock formula. Like many other contemporary garage acts, countless comparisons can be made between the Tangiers brand of garage, 70's NY punk (Richard Hell & the Voidoids, Television, etc.) and Brit punk bands (Buzzcocks, Adverts, etc.). However, while not much different than newer bands such as Hot Hot Heat, the Hives and Mooney Suzuki, the Tangiers manage to raise the standard with great pop hooks and lots and lots of energy. If you liked Hot Hot Heat's latest, this is better. If you like the Hives, this is about as catchy. If you like 60's garage/glam rock/punk rock/post-punk you will like it too--the Tangiers steal from all of these genres while creating music that still sounds fresh. Overall, this is a very solid record that will appeal to anyone who's into new garage music!"
5,"a beautiful, deep, and useful book","I had a very touchy issue with my daughter and I wanted to talk to her about it but I couldn't get started. Then I came across Maisel's book and read it all the way through in just a few minutes and felt changed. I understood what I would say, how I would say it, and even what I would reply depending on what my daughter said. Amazing! The best few minutes I ever spent. Every parent should own this little book and give it as a gift to their parent friends!"
5,essential stuff!,"my girlfriend read this, then made me read it.very cool! ms. royalle is remarkable, and a sharp writer.everyone should read this!"
1,How to listen to Candida talk about herself,"Maybe this book works for repressed middle-aged people, but it didn't tell me anything I don't already know."
4,Different...,It was interesting to read...however...it didn't contain much information that a normal 20-something doesn't know...at least in my experience and those of my friends! :)However - it does have a lot of information that all women need to know! So if you're sheltered - buy this book!
2,Not what I expected,"The description is for a 4' light, not a light with a 4' cord. It may be what some people are looking for, but it's not what I wanted/needed. But the return was very easy, the refund very quick, and the customer service was polite and helpful."
1,Most Anglocentric Book Ever,"A survey of the appendix says it all. 14 pages are devoted to a detailed listing of the British order of battle down to the battalion. The Germans get less than a page (including comical statements such as ""Army Group B were all infantry corps""), the French get less than half a page, and the Belgians and Dutch share a single sentence."
5,LOVE Numan's music,"There's so many songs to enjoy on this double disk! ""Dark"" (one of my top faves) ""Bleed"", ""Every Day I Die"" and ""Absolution"" is just the tip of the iceberg. Even his remakes of ""Cars"" sounds better that the original version. Dark, emo, melodic and haunting, any Numan fan should have this."
4,I had no idea!,The recharged Me! I Disconnect From You is by itself worth the purchase. There are some very good mixes on these discs. Everything has been given a facelift with new synths and contemporary beats. If you like industrial and/or electronic dub...you will find this quite complex and satisfying. A lot of work went into these tracks. Very impressive.
4,Great re-mixes,"The remixes, with only two exceptions, are great. I have been a fan of Gary Numan since 1980 and have a large collection of CD's, tapes and albums. This CD is definitely worth adding to a Gary Numan music collection. The rework of Pure and Dominion Day are awesome. The new song Crazier is good but Ancients is better. Hope this helps."
1,not happy,"Never got the porter. I talked to costumer service and he told me it was going to be reshipped ,well I'm still waiting for the poster .not a good experience"
3,Rent it,"It's entertaining exactly once. I'm a fan of many B-movies, but this slid down the scale into C at best. Some of the effects are hokey; so's the plot. For lovers of horror films only, and specifically the ones who aren't terribly picky. If this movie scares you, you're probably a pre-teen and shouldn't be watching films for adults. ;)"
1,Horror Remakes Suck,"The original Night/Demons was a classic 80's horror film. The 2010 Demons is a steaming pile of horse pucky. I really don't even know where to start with this muddled mess. But I'll try...1. Shannon Elizabeth as Angela, really?2. Eddie Furlong looks like a bloated reject from Fraggle Rock3. The most un-erotic lesbian make out scenes ever4. CGI that looked good in 1997on the plus side I liked the soundtrackAvoid at all costs"
3,Pretty good. crappy ending,"It was an ok movie... Not as good as the original though... It ended stupid! It could've been longer The effects were good. If they do a sequel, I hope it's better!"
1,WORST horror remake ever.... just wow,"I don't write reviews very often, but I saw this movie tonight and I want my $4 back from the rental store. This remake takes virtually everything that was memorable about the original (the creepy atmosphere, original death scenes, characters) and flushes it down the toliet. This movie is worse than (Rob Zombie's) Halloween II.... k it's pretty close. One the positive side it does have Shannon Elizabeth who always looks good and the first facial closeups of the demons are freaky. Everything else is a watered down version of your modern, straight to DVD horror flick. Now I understand why they postponed the release for so long, somehow it makes the originals seem like the godfather trilogy."
4,Iiiits hollween people!,This movie is not that bad ! IM sure there other movies out there that are worse. i liked this movie. Its better then the first night of the demons movies.
3,Night of the...,"It's A Ghouls Night Out as Glenn Danzig would say! I thought the movie was pretty good despite it being a B-Movie, it should satisfy most who are into Horror business,Plenty of low intelligence yet beautiful women,dumb party kids and yes even gore for the sickos out there, I just thought it was good cause it was scary,it gets carried away with the blood alot but hey,I didn't even notice Shannon Elizabeth was in it until the Credits!Thanks Netflix you have one decent B-Movie out of a bunch!"
3,"Good Try, but not Good Enough","Good Film for the most part, just falls short. Takes too long to get going. Good enough to rent, worth one watch. Wouldnt buy it. Edward put on about 100 pounds, the females are clothed too long. Once the demons started chasing them it picked up and rocked. So I would rent the film, wouldnt waste money buying it."
3,Not as bad as it looks.,"Not a great horror film but better then I had heard it would be. I saw the original back in the day and I do not see why any one would care if they remade that hunk of trash. This to me is as good as the original in my mind.I think Shannon Elizabeth is a so so actress and fits the bill just fine as the party girl here, I even like her as a demon. Eddy Furlong has lost all ability to act and plays the drug dealer who ends up fighting for his chubby faced life. To be fair Edward Furlong is perfect for this role and is as good as any one else in the movie.I like the effects in the movie and think the make up, sound track and sets are good also. If you like bad horror with some nice looking Demons thrown in you may get a kick out of this ""remake"" but if your looking for a great horror film stay away."
2,Not worthy!,"I am a fan of the original. I decided to give this a shot, as it was streaming on Netflix and had a decent rating (3.8 stars at the time of my viewing.) Up until the end, it was just mediocre. The end killed it. Granted it had a few decent scenes in it, the little enjoyment I got from them didn't make up for the rest of the movie.I cannot recommend this one."
4,Impressive Modern Horror,"I have grown up with Horror movies from all eras and pride myself on having diversity in my tastes. With all the crap being put out by Hollywood these days, it's hard to find a good Horror movie. Being that I grew up with Night of the Demons, Evil Dead, The Thing, and countless other Horror classics from the 80s I was rather impressed with this remake. It held just the right amount of difference between it and the original. Not too over-the-top and not too serious. It doesn't try to sell itself for being anything more than what it is which is a remake of a great movie. Though it somewhat lacked the feeling of tension throughout, that may just be my own desensitization. All in all it's very entertaining and satisfying visually and the fact that Linnea Quigley makes a cameo appearance in it just adds to it. Definitely worth a watch."
1,SO awful.,"I love the original movie and liked the sequels. I also love Monica Keena. So I was quite looking forward to this.Good GOD it was awful. I feel so bad for Monica. I also feel like slapping the person who supposedly wrote a script, although really it only felt like tortured and desperate ad-libbing. At the end the credits took ages to roll, and I thought everyone had gone Allan Smithee on this mofo. Wouldn't blame them."
