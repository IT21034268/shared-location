2,College Text.,"I did not care for the way this book presented the facts. Just a boring read. I must admit, I bought this book only because it was required for class. But even my professor was not 100% satisfied with this book and this is what he specializes in."
3,Cambridge University scholars against American interpretation of origins of GLOBALIZATION!,"This is a scholarly and academic indictment of American scholars on the origins of GLOBALIZATION. However, their differences with the Americans is useful and enlightening. The Cantabridgians are all historians of reputation and they see the nature of GLOBALIZATION through the lens of classical historical analysis and dismiss economics, technolgy, innovation - - as an American notion and ergo, wrong! (Full disclosure: the author of this review read economics at Oxford with concentration on the international aspects)"
1,Impossible read,"It was required text - wish I'd found it used because I will never read it and won't recommend it. Maybe I can sell it at a yard sale to some unsuspecting soul. It's dry and extremely intellectual (disclaimer: I consider myself of above average intelligence and am interested in globalization). There's not an interesting sentence in the book. A total waste of money and I let the instructor know. He only had us read the first chapter anway...a smallish paperback not worth the big bucks it cost.Debbie, Illinois"
4,great music from a talented singer/songwriter,"This is my 2nd favorite Erelli album (Compass & Companion being the first, which, in my opinion, is one of the best disks in its genre in the past decade). Erelli's voice is a powerful instrument, and he uses it so well on this disk. The songs range from folk to swing, with a touch of blues, all flavored with an americana roots sensibility. The band is sooooo tight (I've been fortunate enough to see them perform - drop everything and go!), the playing is so crisp. This is a pleasure to listen to - I've turned about 10 people on to this disk and haven't heard a complaint yet."
5,Quite impressed by this young author,"It reminded me of the good old days of being a kid. You know doing nothing, cracking open favorite book, reading until dark. Arianna Kelt, written by J R King when he was twelve truly captures the sense of wonder and atmosphere of a classy adventure story, the kind any kid or any one who is young at heart can truly enjoy. I was really impressed with King's writing skills. The story was outstanding, and I suggest you buy this book. Full of action, imagery and solid description, you'll feel like you are there in this wizarding universe with Arianna and her friends. The sequel,Arianna Kelt and the Renegades of Time (Deluxe Edition, Wizards of Skyhall Book 2) (Wizards of Skyhall), is equally as good if not better."
1,Warning for fake reviews!,"Hello,The case of ""Robert Stanek"" has been very interesting as a avid fantasy reader. Stanek created +300 fake accounts on amazon which he used to promote his own books on forums, write fake reviews, and for some reason posting lot's of 1-star reviews on authors books including Patric Rothfus. While doing a case study about theese fake accounts and listing them up I found something funny, all the 5-star reviews on this book was actually done by Robert Staneks fake muppet army. So be warned about buying this product!"
1,Doesn't stack up,"This was obviously written by a very precocious 12 year old, but a 12 year old just the same. Amazing for her age, but the lack of a plot and the immaturity of the writing is obvious. I would recommend buying books by Angie Sage, Jonathan Stroud, Brandon Mull, Jennifer Allison, Elizabeth Haydon, Diana Wynne Jones and so many others writing in this genre instead."
4,One of the BEST,"This is really one of the best books I have EVER read. I got it recently and I haven't put it down since. I love the new worlds, all the different surroundings, the interesting names, and the idea of wizards and warlocks waging a secret war against each other with humans never knowing. I found myself wondering what would happen next to the characters when I had to put the book down for any length of time; something lacking in many Fantasy novels. Thus I finished the book in only two days. I can't wait for the next book in this series. King is fast on his way to becoming one of the best Fantasy writers. Those who love fast paced Fantasy novels will definitely not be dissapointed!"
1,"""discerning social gathering wants & expects to hear...""","""discerning social gathering wants & expects to hear..."" ""the sophisticated private domain for the well-heeled, uber cool society...""Please don't buy it... The music contains full of pretentious French lyrics and the beat is flat. It runs on and on again ...It is really boring music. I think the dj tried so hard to be in the scene and he impresses no one at the end."
4,Comedians perform seriously enjoyable hard rock,"This Is Spinal Tap, Rob Reiner's classic 1984 ""mockumentary"" starring Michael McKean, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer as a bumble-headed, Deep Purple-ish rock band may have been a hilarious parody of the somewhat bloated hard rock outfits of the day but, no matter how absolutely dead-on its caricatures, it always seemed as if This Is Spinal Tap had been created with a touch of love and admiration for its targets. Likewise, the movie's soundtrack, written and performed largely by the film's stars and director themselves, actually features some quality rock and roll. When one is in the mood for beer-rock guilty pleasure, libido-fused infernos such as ""Tonight I'm Gonna Rock You,"" ""Sex Farm"" and ""Big Bottom"" certainly deliver. Plus, the recent digital remastering enhances the album rather well. Still, it would have been if the remastering had been done in Dublin."
5,Pure Genius!,"This album is as black as black can be. I'm particularly fond of the socially confronting lyrics on 'Sex Farm'. A deep, dark, brooding, and yet enlightening, commentary on post-modern society as we know it, with a touch of history (Stonehenge) thrown in for good measure. These boys know music and know how to deliver it. Wonderfully recorded in dobly. A blacker album you will not find.....period."
1,"Love the movie, but why bother with the soundtrack?","Why would anyone want to listen to these awful tunes alone, without the movie? They're funny within the context of the film, but rather pointless without it. Hearing a rotten (but admittedly hilarious) item like ""Sex Farm Woman"" in stereo sound along with the movie is rather painful in itself. But take away the dialogue and you have a doubly (dubly? dolby?) bad tune. Ha ha to the woman reviewer who also gave this one star who didn't get the joke of the movie at all."
4,A must have for Tap enthusiasts,"It is all the music from This is Spinal Tap plus two versions of Christmas with the Devil which was not in the actual movie. Too bad they decided to leave off ""All the way home"". Could have used that better than a second version of Christmas. But, all in all , if you loved Spinal Tap (and I did) then this is a CD you must have to make your collection complete.Enjoy it. I certainly did....over and over again."
1,Golf Gloves---But What SIZE are they ??????,"Wants to sell golf gloves, but doesn't state a size in the description !!!Very difficult to buy since hands are NOT all the same size !!!"
2,Beware of the shipping cost,"Shipping and handling cost is somewhat as much as the product cost. You will have a chance to see the actual S&H; before you confirm payment. However, if you use Amazon one click to order this item, you will not have chance to say no.Product wise, this is a good product"
3,good cheap product,"I pay 4 bucks for each glove and thats their value.They are good but litter bit plastic on some areas,and wont last long.It's a good deal for 4 bucks."
3,Bullshit,"I ordered this gun because it was cheap. It is really stupid. First of all, it's like 90 fps, not 120 or w/e. the scope is innacurate and retarded, and the laser pointer is decent but completely useless. (i have never used it) If you are a begginer, this gun will be good for about 3 months then you want to use it as a sidearm and get an electric gun. Your Welcome."
4,As advertised...,"This suit is exactly what I ordered -- small enough for training/racing but not as small as a ""traditional"" Speedo suit."
3,Plenty of stars better than this,"I take note of any album unanimously given 5 stars. Usually it ain't - and this ain't. 5 stars means there's nothing better. I disagree. Michael Brook, David Sylvian and especially Bill Nelson have all created much better ambient guitar rock. The first track starts off strong with a fuzzed out psychedelic guitar jam. Then there's feedback and wailing over a tom and bass drum beat with a standard synth intro and outro. The rest of the songs are indistinguishable soundscapes characterized by predictable three note scales or single chord ideas. Even though the instrumentation is organic and interesting, the melodies and songwriting drop the rest of the album into the background. His rhythms never stray far from the western 4/4 and his world beat is no more adventurous than Yanni's.Explore a little more. Try Michael Brook's ""Cobalt Blue"" or ""Assembly"", or Bill Nelson's ""Blue Moons and Laughing Guitars"" before anointing this album as the best ever."
5,My Favorite Album. Ever.,"Truly great albums create a universe of their own, and no album does that better than Safe Journey. Safe Journey takes you on a funhouse ride through tortured jungles of feedback and vast echoing tundras of acoustic guitar, ending in a spiritual ascent into the cosmos. ( And, no, I didn't take acid before I wrote this. ) I would recommend this album to anyone with an adventurous pair of ears."
1,Terrible Purchase,"Unfortunately, when I ordered this, the product that showed up was blue instead of green and had the wrong emblem on it. Piece of trash. Do not purchase this faceplate if you have any self-respect."
5,"A ""must"" for all UNIX freaks.","Together the two books in this set are the definitive source for the historical publications related to the development of the UNIX OS. Peter Salus' ""A quarter century of UNIX"" makes a great companion to these two."
1,NOT FUNNY!,"This movie was full of dark, sick, and overall STUPID humor, that is NOT funny, but, just came off as distirbinmg."
1,About the worst movie I have ever seen,"Death to Smoochy lacks almost ALL entertainment value. It's one of those movies that looks very promising, is well acted, and well-directed, but has a really bad script. I wonder how it was able to attract such a fine cast of actors.Further, of the 5 or so jokes in this movie, all are of the ""hammer-to-the-head"" or ""farting noise"" style. It would seem the scriptwriter never could decide whether to make it for children or for adults.I enjoyed Meet the Parents (as suggested by another reviewer) but was dumbfounded by this piece of cinematic drab."
1,missed big time,"I get what they were trying to do... the kiddy entertainment biz is filled with foul mouthed, violent and moblike people. Although parts of this movie are funny on their own, as a whole they missed by a long shot.Someone should have been brave enough to go back to the original shoot footage to edit in the connecting pieces... such a waste of the superior talent of Robin Williams, Edward Norton and Jon Stewart!"
1,Absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen,"I can't believe I just spent two hours watching this .... What an unorganized, poorly written, poorly directed waste of time this was. There are MAYBE two laughs in the whole movie, and they weren't even enough to write home about. Not even the great Robin Williams, the venerable Edward Norton, and the heretofore widely respected Danny DeVito could save this monstrosity.Save your money. If you want a funny Robin Williams movie, buy ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" or something where he shows his talent instead of screaming nonsense for two hours, as he does in this celluloid tripe."
1,EEWWW that smell!,"The worst movie ever? This movie is marketed as being a ""Barney"" bashing movie, for all those parents fed up with having to endure endless hours of mindless childrens videos. But instead of biting sarcasm and rampant deviltry, the viewer is subjected to endless full-blown musical numbers written for children. Watching this movie was like watching 2 hours of Barney videos. Instead of treating children's icons like pinatas, this movie is an homage to them. The script was written for children. It completely lacks adult humor, and any humor at any level period. The lone exception is one scene by robin Williams, where he slams into a brick wall during a spoof of Singing in the Rain. I was stunned that there were no other laughs in a movie with such a great comedian.If you haven't had enough of Barney then this movie is for you."
3,Bizare Movie,"Think of the ""Kill Barney"" songs that a 6 yr old sings when Barney is no longer funny. Then film a movie where its the adults who do him in and you've got ""Death to Smoochy"". It's not Robin Williams best, but not his worst either. Mr. Williams does wonderful when you can let him go and just free associate the jokes and like in ""Good Morning Vietnam"". But here he barely gets going and the scene cuts away from him.Also hardly deserving of its ""R"" rating. Most kids will have heard the language on the playground even if they don't understand it. The violence happens mostly off camera or its a set up and then a camera cut. As in we see the axe, we hear the scream but we don't see anything. It happens in a very cartoonish way. Or maybe I'm totally immune to movie violence. Anyway its no wonder it didn't stay on the big screen that long. There aren't that many people who are going to like this."
3,"A weird trip, no doubt about that...","This movie has a frenzied rhythm, an astonishing number of sequences, and a high number of characters. Norton and Williams could give wings to their imaginations to interpret the characters.I did not like the movie totally, but I gave it a fair chance, and it proved to be a good movie, with a bold ambition, but with the exceution a little bit floppy."
4,Demented 'Death',"Through the eyes of Danny DeVito, he sees the world of kiddy show biz being run by the mob. Rainbow Randolph (Robin Williams) got caught accepting bribes to put a kid on his show. Oh double dear! He's out of a job. It's time for a new character to take the spotlight. That's Smoochy (Edward Norton). His good will makes all of the producers sick and people hate him. Why? Because he's so golly nice and Randolph hates it. Randolph puts 'rocket ship' cookies into Smoochy's bag, Randolph runs into walls and is getting disrespected. Smoochy is framed and another man in a purple suit is brought down. Poor goofball. Danny DeVito has made a sick, but funny movie. One to remember."
2,Reactions will differ,"Eh.Good acting from Williams & Norton as unlikable kidshow hosts, same old same old performance by DeVito as The Danny DeVito Character. Kind of overblown in a ""look at us, we're satirizing children's television!"" way. Any episode of South Park has more humor & irreverence than this entire movie.HOWEVER.You may not agree. It's very much the kind of movie people either really like or really dislike. Definitely check it out on rental before buying."
4,SO funny!,"I LOVE Edward Norton.. and this was such a fun role to watch him play. He was GREAT as Smoochy and he portrayed his character so well. It was a dark comedy, something that the truly wicked would enjoy.. I thought the movie was very entertaining. I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because I thought it dragged a little bit towards the end.. but that was mainly because Robin Williams character was a whack-job beyond belief!! I would recommend watching it atleast once... it is a very funny movie!"
5,"""uh...uh...it's a rocket!""","""Death to Smoochy"" is laugh-out-loud hilarious! Robin Williams and Edward Norton were GREAT. The whole concept? No one puts Rainbow Randolph out of work! DIE SMOOCHY DIE!! I recommend this film to everyone (even if you're not fond of dark comedies).Totally original and brilliantly directed by Danny DeVito, ""Death to Smoochy"" has become one of my favorites!"
5,Brilliant!,This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I'm dissappointed it's out the the theaters already. I will definately buy on DVD!
5,Great Laughs!,"This movie stars Edward Norton, is there anything more that can be said? ;) It's so nice to see such amazing diversity in an actor's characters. (If you want to know what I'm referring to, just go watch American History X and then Death to Smoochy).""I think you'd have to be wired way too tight not to be able to laugh at this movie. It's able to give you a dark chuckle on an adult level and satirize things in a sophisticated way."" -Edward NortonSure DTS's humor may be a little juvenile at some times, but it's nevertheless hillarious.Highly recommended, if nothing else see it for Edward Norton, he gives a great performance (as always) and his character (Sheldon Mopes) is a nice change from the usual."
5,"""My step-dad's not mean, he's just adjusting.""","I've heard a lot of negative commentary on this film, and I can understand why. The sort of rampant dark humor that makes Death to Smoochy so fantastic isn't to everyone's taste. The film is vulgar, violent, sarcastic, peculiar, and ridiculous. In short, it's brilliant. I believe that the only two reasons that it works so entirely well are: a)the perfect direction of Danny DeVito and b)the performances of a very talented cast. Robin Williams is just plain hilarious, as per usual. I think that much of his dialogue in the movie was improvised, which works so well for him. Edward Norton is just naturally silly enough to make us believe Smoochy- not many actors could have pulled off such a character with as much charm and believeablity as he. Catherine Keener, as always, does a wonderful job, and all the rest of the cast deserve commendation as well. Hats off to this delightfully (and naughtily) funny movie, it will always be a favorite of the few."
1,are you kidding me?,"One of the worst films i have seen in the past few years,and that's saying a lot with the awful stuff that's being released on a regular basis...Edward Norton's attempt at comedy is painful to watch. Not sure whether it's his fault OR the script, but who cares? This movie stinks. Catherine Keener's performance is mailed-in (what's she doing here in the first place?), and Robin Willaims over-the-top maniac role is so tired. Everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves..."
1,Profanity isn't a substitute for humor,"The show had potential, but the writers seemed to be paid by the profane word. The jokes are weak, there is a total lack of parody, despite the potential from Pee-Wee Herman, and some others. This movie makes Cadillac Man and The Best of Times look good and they were BOMBS."
1,This movie [is weak].,"... It's not funny. Wastes Robin William's talent. Also, I wonder how the actors said all of those four letter words in front of all of the kids in the movie? The only storyline I enjoyed was the Irish mafia. ..."
3,Funnee Stuff!!!,"Directed and starring Danny DeVito , Smoochy takes us on a journey to the dark side of television: kid's tv. Ed Norton stars as a man with a mission: to make kids happy and healthy. He develops a kid show host of hosts that unfortunately unseats Robin Williams' top kids show spot. Williams is brilliant and gives me hope that he can still be edgy and dark. His Disney type films of late have been lackluster and generic. It is wonderful to see him in this arena again. Remember The Fisher King? Smoochy is a winner. ***1/2 Stars."
4,funny movie,"critics might have hated it, but i thought it was hilarious. Edward Norton was believsble and yet adorable at the same time. Robin Williams was over the top at times, but hysterical as the disgruntled former child show host, trying to sabotage ""Smoochy the Rhino"" show. definately worth checking out if u enjoy dark comedies."
2,"Boring and only mildly funny, 2 and a half stars","""Death To Smoochy"" is a murder comedy that has some decent preformances from both Edward Norton and Robin Williams, but failed to really keep my attention or interest. I only found it amusing during a few parts of the film. Most of the funnier parts I found were on the Additional Scenes segment of the DVD. Plus, the film wasn't as morbid as I had been lead to believe. The only thing really giving this movie its R rating was the bad language in the movie, not really the themes surrounding the movie. The whole ""death"" to Smoochy part of the movie really wasn't presented that well. I also found a lot of the characters in the film irritating and annoying and Catherine Keener just can't really play [an evil/cruel woman]. Her acting seemed more like faking when it came to the character she was trying to portray. Overall, the movie kind of dragged on and the climax to the movie wasn't really that exciting or interesting. I don't recommend it."
5,BadA$$,"This movie was great, Robin Williams playing the bad guy on excited me more. Edward norton was a complete turnaround from his earlier acting in Fight Club and The Score and fit the role of the vegetarian nice guy who sings to crack addicts. I couldn't stop laughing the entire time. Devito has a good thing going. I want to see more."
4,Death to Smoochy,"Very funny and very twisted comedy from the sick and demented mind of Danny DeVito who brought you Throw Momma From the Train.Robin Williams and Edward Norton make a hilarious duo as enemys.Starring: Robin Williams , Edward Norton , Danny DeVito , Cathrine Keener , and Jon Stewart.by Michael Margetis"
2,"Good actors, good idea, hideous execution","Twenty bucks for this flick was a crime'Cause honey, this ain't worth a dimeBut just to be fairI really don't care:I just wish they'd refund me my time"
1,"""I LOATHE YOU!""",Unimpressive and completly unentertaining. Some funny moments here and there but the plot is totally childish. Just my opinion.
2,Why o why,This movie is in the most part a discrase. shure there are a few funny parts but for the mot part this movie is stupid and poorly acted. I am still trying to figure out why williums and Norten(two actors that I like very much)did this mess.
2,A disappointment,"This has to be one of the worst movies that I have seen in a long time. I was really looking forward to this film, too. Danny DeVito is a very talented man who makes very sophisticated and funny films, such as ""The War of the Roses"", ""Throw Momma from the Train"", and ""Matilda"". Why he chose this film as his latest project is a mystery. It was only sporadically funny, but it was mostly crude. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good dark comedy every now and then...GOOD being the key word here. This was a long and drawn out, boring experience. It went on and on and on and went nowhere.Edward Norton does the best he can with the material that he has been given. I love Robin Williams, but he can do much better! Danny Devito can also do much, much better! A major disappointment. DO NOT BRING CHILDREN TO THIS FILM.SKIP IT."
2,Midly Entertaining with a Few Funny Moments.,"With the bevy of talented actors in this film, perhaps I expected more. Robin Williams is a great comedian, though his movies have slipped at the box office lately, and Edward Norton is perhaps one of the best actors of our time. Danny DiVito and Jon Stewart did an admirable job as part of the supporting castas well. But I thought that Spinner was the best character, and he had brain damage.Overall This movie just lacked any real substance to it. I didn't really feel like it had any depth to it. The plot was interesting and new, but yet very thin. In fact perhaps too thin to be made into a motion picture. The sarcastic remarks and few comedic episodes kept me entertained enough to finish it though.For all of you Anti-Barney people, this film may give you an insight to the corupt world of children's television. Or it might just bore you to the point where you'll hate it just like Barney."
2,okay but it's no THROW MAMMMA FROM THE TRAIN.,"Robin Williams, playing the third deranged character he's played this year(after INSOMNIA and before ONE HOUR PHOTO), stars as Rainbow Randolph, a beloved but corrupt kids TV show star in the vein of what Barney could be in real life (who's under that suit anyway?). Anyway, rainbow is fired for accepting bribes. He is replaced by the earnest Sheldon Mopes (Edward Norton; FIGHT CLUB) and his persona of Smoochy the Rhino. This doesn't bode well for Rainbow Rudolph and he plots revenge on Smoochy. Sound ridiculous? It is.But it's meant to be. This isn't a great comedy but it has its moments. However, I expected more from the talent involved. I thought Danny Devito made a great comedy with THROW MAMMA FROM THE TRAIN and I guess I just wanted this film to be a little more like that one. Not bad, worth a rental just for Norton and Williams performances."
4,Good Movie,If you like a dark comedy then this one will definitely have you laughing. It is really funny to see Ed Norton as a gullible and naive children's show host and Robin Williams does a great job as the evil and washed up children's show host. The shipping was fast and the company represented their product honestly.
4,Death to Smoochy,"With reviews this polarized, it must come down primarily to taste. Personally, I loved Death to Smoochy. When my husband brought it home from the video store, I groaned because I knew how bad the reviews had been. But I watched it and loved it so much that I rewatched it the next day.It is a dark comedy and a satire, but one that takes us to a very sweet and uplifting conclusion. It is a story of the loss of innocence, but also of the rediscovery of childhood's faith in the goodness of others. It is both disarming and touching, all the more so for the dark routes it travels.Perhaps the expectation of a feature-length Barney satire is what leads to such a disappointed reaction in many of the reviewers. Lampooning Barney (who is already a perfect study in self-satire) is not really the focus of the movie. My advice is to watch it with as few preconceptions as possible. You might just be as pleasantly surprised as I was."
4,funny,Ed Norton is so funny and so is Robin Williams in this movie. It's a definite one to check out
5,Great movie,"I think that this movie was great. Any one that thinks that Robin williams is funny should see this movie, And any [person] that would think that this movie is a kids show should get therapy or go to ... . Because this movie is rated ""R"". So you dumb [person] that said this was a bad movie because you saw the poster should shut ... up. I give this movie ""5"" stars. It was a great movie. GO SEE THIS MOVIE. or rent at local video store near you."
2,Leaks,"I have been on a mission to find a cooler that does not leak. After purchasing 2 coolers within a month's time, both different brands, I decided to try my luck with the Igloo. It's terrible. The lid does not screw on, it's a pressure fit. I knew this when I bought it. The carry-handle helps to keep the lid in place. Although there is no problem with the lid coming off, it leaks everywhere around the rim when you transport it. I found this out the hard way when I filled it with Kool-Aid and ended up with a car mat soaked with red KoolAid! This is by far the worst of the 3 coolers that I have tried. The first one was a 2 gallon Rubbermaid (leaks around the rim) and the second was a 2 gallon stackable Coleman cooler (leaks around spout). If anybody can recommend a cooler that does NOT leak, I'm all ears!"
5,Love it,"My husband is a UPS driver and drinks a lot of water during the day. I've went to a lot of different stores trying to find this 3 gallon cooler and never had any luck finding it. The stores always sell a 2 gallon (which is never enough water for him) and a 5 gallon (which is way too much). I love that I can always find it at Amazon and get it delivered in a timely manner. He'll put ice in it first thing in the morning and by the end of his day (sometimes 10 hours later), he still has ice cold water inside. This is the best water cooler I have found and he loves it!"
5,Another great one from Kathy,I have always like Kathy Mattea's singing and this CD is as good as almost any she has ever done. I recommend it.
3,"good zester, poor peeler.","nice a nice grip to it, but the main reason i bought it was to use the peeler portion for my home bar. because it is pointed sideways it is difficult to get the proper leverage to cut away a nice long lemon peel for drinks, and thus difficult to get consistent strips, without a bit of patience and practice. the small zester loops however are great."
2,Not as sharp as it needs to be,Both the zester and the channel knife require a lot of effort to break through anything. I guess I got a dud.
3,OK for zesting but not for lemon twists,"I bought this to make lemon twists for the 'original James Bond martini.' Although it claims to do this, it simply isn't sharp enough to cut through lemon peel using the channel edge. It does an OK job of zesting but plan on ignoring the channel edge because it won't do twists."
3,Zesty Tester,"The oxo good grips lemon zester is good for small jobs. Where more zest is required, I'm finding my preferences find me returning to use my microplane type zesters."
4,good product,I find I have to *push* hard to get thru thick orange and lemon rinds. I have found that the microlane grater is easier and more versitile... The handle feels odd to me... and too big as a grip.
3,"Good grip, weak utensil","Yes, the ergonomics is good, but the utensil itself is weak. If you use this grater with citrus with a tough skin, the metal will bend rapidly and eventually brake."
5,Excellent product & design,Comfortable rubber gripper provides a great deal of control when using the product. The blade is very sharp and stays that way. Perfect for zesting or creating garnish. It is also attractive and durable in design and very compact (doesn't take up a lot of room in the drawer). I love mine. It is a great buy and at a reasonable price.
2,"Hard to make twists, time consuming to zest","I was really looking forward to putting peel twists in mixed drinks, but it's incredibly hard* to make anything over 1cm long with this tool. My friends tried too and they couldn't get anything substantial either. Zesting is fine, although it's much more time-consuming to do with this than with a microblade.* (I should add that I'm no bodybuilder, but still)"
2,It's junk,The workmanship and quality is second rate. The handle is the only nice thing about the zester. The steel is literally junk.
3,Works with a little tweaking,"Like some others have noted, my zester arrived rather dull, but I was able to sharpen it up quickly with a metal file. I got this for the peeler or twist maker part more than the zester part, and now that it's sharp it works ok for that. It does have a tendency to skip every now and then, though I have been able to get out some decently long cocktail twists."
2,Not what I had hoped for,This product did not live up to my expectations. It did not zest properly and the zest it did produce was not as pleaseing to the eye.
1,Dull and disappointed,"I believe that this is a quality control issue since a lot of people have good reviews. The sample that I received is completely dull, so dull that it is not possible to zest a lemon with the big groove - it ends up just tearing the peel. The small zester holes part is also dull and I end up smashing the fruit to get decent zest."
4,Good book,"I thought this book was a good, quick read. It's great for younger readers because it's easy to read. In some parts it's painfully wrenching. It helps you to realize that you shouldn't just pity victims of child abuse, they are real people. I thought that the ending was a little too ""happy"". Almost too good to happen except in a book. I will never forget this book, I reccommend it to all readers."
4,This is a Great Book!,"Laurie is 10 going on 11 years old and her mom, Annabelle, beats her. They move every time someone in the town they live in gets suspicious, and Laurie isn't allowed to have any close friends because Annabelle is afraid that she will tell her friends her secret, and Annabelle doesn't want to risk getting caught. When Laurie makes a friend named George, she keeps it a secret, and when Annabelle finds out she is furious. She beats Laurie hard. Laurie's stepbrother, Tim, finds out about Annabelle and tries to help. You'll like this book because it's very intriguing."
3,An Old HBO Special,"I can remember watching the ""uncut"" rendition on an HBO special years ago and I could not believe (at the time) the opinions and stance Martin Lawrence took on various subjects of the day. You might say I was ""shocked"" not appalled but shocked that Lawrence chose to incorporate many sensitive subjects into his routine: An incredibly talented comic.Personally, I feel Chris Rock saw this performance and borrowed aspects of Lawrence's techniques and subjects. So what! They are both great comics when they are original and averse to appealing to the morons by simplifying their routines.I give this DVD a three star rating because some censoring idiot ""cut"" many scenes from the original HBO Cable TV special and thereby cut the integrity of the original comedic salvo Lawrence proffered."
3,Martin is funny as always..,"While it is an old show, Martin's jokes are still funny. Nice to listen back to some old jokes and stories."
3,Nice,"I usually like Martin lawrance, and I have a good collection of his movies, but this is the first time I see him on a theater stand, Frankly he was not up to my expectations, and I guess that he is a great actor but not a good stand on theater"
5,i luv martin,omg i dont know who would give this movie 1 star i still have this on vhs from back in the day and its still funny i remember the first time i saw this and i was laughing from start to finish i just got done watching this yesterday and i was laughing all the way through
3,Sooo Funny,"I saw this at my man's when I went home from college for the weekend, and he wouldn't let me borrow it b/c he has to show everyone who stops by this DVD. Well, I don't blame him b/c I laughed so hard. I haven't laughed this much through a comedy ever. I reccomend this DVD to anyone who loves comedy b/c Martin is sooo funny!!! I just had to own it myself"
2,Very neat book...but...,"This book was given to me as a gift when I was young. I have really had an interest for the way things work, why they work, how they work etc... This book has it all, however, the reason I gave this product 2 stars is because the book contains heavy references to evolution and evolution theories. Educating readers of what evolution is, what the center focus of belief is based on, and why some scientists believe it is one thing. It's different when you base answers to legitimate questions on evolution. Lots of neat and interesting facts mixed in with a lot of hypothesis and evolution theory. I would recommend finding a different Q & A book.Christian Fobian, Author of Why Christ?"
4,works good,I ordered this item and was not sure it would work but it did. I'm glad I took the chance.
4,Underated album,"This is a very underated country album that believe it or not I first got when I was 4 years old. It's definately better than the pop crap that Tim McGraw and Alabama were putting out at the time (and I'm not some country purist, I just hate corporate music).Some of the best songs here are the fun 'Ten Pound Hammer', the bluesy 'Without Your Love', the beautiful ballad 'Everything I Own', and the pretty funny 'How's The Radio Know'. But the absolute classic here is 'That's As Close As I'll Get To Loving You'. If this song had been released 20 years prior it would be up there with the all time greats, but it's unfortunely forgotten.This is no typical country release, just about every song is good. Very consistent."
2,poor workmanship,"I have owned this garlic press for about 2 years and it failed the other night crushing pieces (I always slice them first) for my chili recipe. May seem hefty but it cal break at the pivot. I'm tired of companies making cheap kitchen equipment and will look for something that slices small pieces instead of ""crushing"" if this is a weak point for these products."
2,not so good,"The part about the garlic press that should be so great is a piece of plastic that cleans the press after use. Mine broke off after a couple of uses.The press is fine, just not as great as advertised.I have no knowledge of the pizza wheel.The price is great for the two pieces. I paid as much for one piece."
2,Low quality,"I bought this because of the reversible cleaning gizmo, which worked fine. But it was hard to press, left a lot behind, and ultimately the handle broke - the metal sheared into two pieces. Poor quality."
2,OXO Garlic Press,"I owned this press for approximately one year and was happy with it until it broke yesterday. I would expect a well-made press to last several years. My other complaint is that when it is placed in the dishwasher, water seeps into the handle covers, so dishwashing is not recommended. I will not buy another kitchen utensil by this brand because it does not last."
5,Wonderful Sub,"I have these connected to a 5.1 yamaha set and a 7.1 channel panasonic receiver, and the quality is amazing. If you want the room to shake, get these. The base is wonderful for the price. Highly recommended"
4,Athena Subwoofer Review,"I purchased the Athena AS-800 for a basement stereo system. I was really surprised at the quality and sound of this subwoofer. I have larger subs for my other systems that cost a lot more and this 8 inch sub sounds as good as the big boys. Not quite as deep in the bass, but pretty darn close. I would recommend this small speaker for anyone looking for a resonable priced subwoofer for a stereo or video system"
3,works great when battery is in.,"This is my third Luminox watch. Unfortunately replacing battery can cause watch to die. It kills me to see it in my junk pile, but I have decided to buy a different watch. Otherwise Luminox makes great watches."
2,Disappointing,"Venison, rack of lamb, Squab Dijionnaise, Milanese Cornmeal Cakes with Herbs and Bacon, Lord Baltimore's Crabmeatn in Ramekins... not the type of items that I think of when I want to grill. Would have been helpful if the book was referred to as ""gourmet"" faire. Don't believe I will ever use this brand new book."
3,Works good until it breaks,"I'd have to agree with most of the other reviewers. The garlic press works ok until the hinge snaps. It happened to me while making a red sauce and I couldn't find one of the broken pieces! :-( I also didn't care for the rubber handles that slide around. Other than that, the ergonomics are great. It feels hefty and well balanced. If you can live with the fact that it will probably break on you at some point, whether that is 2 years or 2 days down the road, then it is a decent press."
2,Not as good as my old Oxo press,"I love the older Oxo garlic press that I have had for many years and when I went to buy one for the RV I decided to get another Oxo just like my old one. The style was changed, which I wasn't sure about, but bought one anyway. I didn't care for the feel of it as much my old one, though it seemed to work almost as well as the older style at first. But today I was using it out in the RV and I wasn't able to get hardly any garlic pressed out of it. I finally went into the house and brought my old one out and it worked perfect! I don't think much of the new style and as so many people have stated that theirs has broken, I am going to replace it with a Zyliss. My older one in the house has gotten tons of use and is still working great while my newer one, which I think I may have had for maybe 2 years give or take, has hardly been used at all (especially since the RV sits all winter) and now the press doesn't work. My old one gets 5 stars, but this newer version only 2."
1,One word...RUST,"No matter what you do, the garlic press rusts! It got so bad that I had to throw it away."
2,"Never worked that well, and then broke!","I'm probably pretty hard on garlic presses, as we cook with garlic almost every day, but I still couldn't believe that I managed to snap the handle off of this one after only a few months of use. Luckily, I had never loved the press - the way the block fit into the bowl always seemed to result in some garlic coming out of the sides and not being pressed through the holes - so this gave me the opportunity to get one I really like (the Zyliss)."
2,decent at best,"I used this for about 2-3 years before it broke when crushing a clove of garlic. I was squeezing down pretty tight when, bam, the metal just broke. I also have to say that it was always a pain to put in the diswasher b/c whenever I took it out, water would leak out of the handles from in between the metal and the black plastic coating. I'm not a fan."
1,Garlic Press Smashes No More..,"I bought this unit over a year ago and I loved it, it's attractive, easy to use and comfortable to grip. Unfortunately, it isn't durable, with limited use the top hinge snapped under the stress of crushing a small garlic bulb. Avoid it you can."
3,"Worked great, until it broke",I was delighted with the garlic press and recommended it to others. Unfortunately it broke after about a dozen uses. I certainly was disappointed in the lack of durability.
1,The worst garlic press - EVER!,"I had a Zyliss Susi Garlic Press for many years and just loved it. However, I lost mine during a move. I tried this OXO model and was very disappointed because it just did not work. More garlic comes out the sides of the press than out the front and you have to use a knife to scrap the garlic into your dish. It is just useless with garlic splattering all over everything. I have found OXO products to be cheaply made and poorly designed. I needed a garlic press in a pinch but learned a valuable lesson - you get what you pay for especially when it comes to kitchen utensils."
2,Too Much Trouble!,"I really tried to like this garlic press but, alas, I don't. While the cleaning mechanism works well and the handles are comfortable, it never completely crushes the garlic clove. Instead it leaves a good 1/4 of the garlic clove stuck to the bottom of the press. To use the entire clove, you have to fish out the garlic remains and then mince then by hand. The problem seems to be that the two sides of the press don't meet tightly. In frustration I bought IKEA's inexpensive garlic press and it works wonders."
4,This Italian loves it!,"I've had my OXO Garlic press for three or four years now and it's still like new. I use it approximately 3 or 4 times a week. As said above, this gadget is extremely easy to clean. Just scape out the residue pulp with a small knife, then run it under hot water - done! Perhaps the secret in its longevity it that I cut each garlic clove lengthwise and place each piece cut side down before squeezing. Highly recommend this item."
2,I agree with the first review...,"The grip handles take in water and drip into other dishes. It's quite annoying. However, atleast this one doesn't rust."
2,Not happy with it,"This press is ok if you don't mind throwing away the rubber handles. I hate the stagnant water that gets in there, like everyone else said. I discovered the water while pressing some garlic and it got over everything. It just gets nasty in there so I no longer use the handles. It hasn't broken on me, I've just been too lazy to get a new one. It does leak garlic back onto the handles also. Not worth your money IMO."
2,"Looks sturdy, but it's not","I liked the stocky construction of this press when I bought it. It seemed solid. But, it has a few problems.1. the rubber handles slip--this is a minor problem.2. liquefied garlic oozes out the sides--this is often the part of the garlic you want, so you scrape it off--kind of annoying.3. it leaves a large part of the garlic uncrushed4. after only a few months' use, the hinges break completely, and into the trash it goesI did find this press cleans up fast and easily. That's its main strength. But, overall, I was unhappy with the longevity of this item."
1,"Garlic smusher, not press","When my ancient garlic press finally broke, I bought this one, mistakenly thinking that all garlic presses are equal and liking this one for its design and color. However, I can't get it to actually press the garlic! It just sort of squashes it against the metal grate, rather than pushing it through. I generally have to resort to fishing the smushed garlic back out of the press with a knife and cutting it up. Although this is easier than cutting up an unsmushed piece, I would much rather have a garlic press that did the whole job itself!"
2,"Ours broke, too","It took a couple of years of use, but ours broke at the hinge, too. Worked nicely while it lasted, though. The plastic cleaner is very handy and effective."
2,Broken Hinge,"Generally I have chosen to purchase OXO products because of their durability. I am very disappointed in OXO this time. After just one year of use, the hinge on my garlic press is broken, and I am now pounding out garlic with a mortar and pestle until I can get to the US to buy a replacement. Unfortunately, I will not be buying another OXO Good Grips Garlic Press. I wish I had read all of the helpful customer reviews before making this purchase. It seems OXO needs to read them as well."
5,Great if you know how to use it!,I've owned this for a few years. I quickly learned to move the handles down a bit before I put in the dishwasher. Give it a good shake and let dry and it's ready for the next use. I use it at least once or twice a week for the last few years. This by far is the best garlic press that I've ever owned. I love the fact that you can clean it by inverting the handle and that it can go in the dishwasher. I've had other garlic presses and this is the best that I've used thus far. It is easy to use with arthritic hands.
5,Best Garlic Press I've ever used,"I used to have a standard garlic press. It was hard to actually press and impossible to clean. The OXO one is heavy so it's easier to press the garlic, and the red bumps make cleaning so easy! No more poking at it with a toothpick for an hour.I trust OXO's stuff to last and I love this garlic press."
2,Not worth it,"Purchased this a few years ago. After 5 uses, the metal part of it snapped in half. It worked well while it lasted. Same thing happened to my mom. I guess they rather put out quantity than quality."
2,Hard to use,"In contrast to some of the other reviews, I find this press harder to use than others that I've owned. This is surprising given OXO's typical track record in usability. In fact, the press that I replaced with this one was also an OXO and worked much better in terms of hand strength required. The reason I replaced the other model was because its coating came off in the dishwasher and it was harder to clean. This is the one real benefit for this model as it is far easier to clean than any other one I've used. The one strange thing that happens with mine is that water will get trapped in the handle and leak in my drawer after it comes out of the dishwasher. It also leaves behind more garlic when pressing than other presses that I've used which feels like a waste. In the end, I'm going to go back to using my old press until I find one that is both easy to use AND easy to clean."
2,It may look sturdy but its FLIMSY,"I've had 2 of these now. They both worked fine. When the first one broke, I wrote it off as a fluke. Now the second one broke as well.I gave it 2 stars as it worked pretty well while in one piece.If you are looking for a ""temporary"" garlic press, this is the one for you.For the rest of us looking for something that will last, the search continues.(BTW, I had an Oxo grater that broke too, so I think I am done with this brand for good)."
2,"worked for a while, then broke","It worked well for two years (used about twice a month), then the body cracked and will no longer press the garlic thru the holes. Disappointing."
3,"Great press, but know that it WILL break","I've had maybe six of these over the past 10 years and they've ALL broken. Some break faster than others. You just never know when it's going to give. But I've gone back again and again because it really does a wonderful job.I've always thought it was just me (and the heavy work load I put on these -- I cook with garlic sometimes 3 times a week) but I see here that breakage is problem for others as well. My last one broke last week, so this time I'm going to try the Trudeau Garlic Press, which looks very similar in design and has better reviews.Happy crushing!"
1,Snapped in two!,"I bought this press about 8 months back, using it only about once a week. Today, it simply snapped in half while I was press a couple of medium cloves! Oxo products are usually well-made, but this is a ""lemon."""
1,"Good Grips, Bad (Broken) Tool","As well as the annoying storing water in the handle (mentioned in other reviews), mine flat out broke. It couldn't take the pressure of use and snapped the metal at the handle. The cast metal parts didn't fit well into each other, either.Comfortable, yes. But the grips are useless when they're on two different pieces."
2,"garlic squasher, anyone?","If you're looking for a garlic press that produces minced garlic, keep looking. This is a garlic squasher, a garlic masher, a garlic crusher, but NOT a garlic press. No actual minced garlic emerges from the little holes. I was so disappointed! My husband finally repaired our old, no-name, made-in-Taiwan garlic press, and we're back in business. Caveat emptor!"
4,A perfectly serviceable garlic press,"I use a lot of garlic in my cooking, but I really hate dicing up garlic. This thing does it for me in matter of seconds. I just press it over the pan where I want the garlic to go and there it is - flavoring my food like a pro.It has good weight in that it feels substantial in the hand - like it's not going to break if I squeeze too tight - and it's easy enough to clean, which is a must since I don't have a dishwasher."
4,Works great,"Easy to clean. Gets the job done. Nice that I can flip it and get the garlic out, although I almost always have to use chopsticks to get the garlic out of the press completely. The plastic grip handles seem to be a bit loose on mine and can slip off easily, but doesn't really affect usage."
2,Wastes a lot of garlic,"There are 2 major problems with this garlic press:1) Much of the garlic gets stuck inside the hopper of the press and will not come out.2) The holes in the press seem to be too large so mince is not as fine as I would like.I owned OXO's garlic press (Item #: 97-6067011) from WS and it was perfect until the cheap coating started to flake off and within a year it completely broke. I got this garlic press as a replacement from OXO but was disappointed with these 2 problems. Still looking for an excellent replacement. From the reviews, it seems that all of them have some type of flaw."
4,Decent Garlic Press with Good Grip,"I used the OXO Good Grips Garlic Press for last 3 months and I liked it. I crushed garlic, ginger, small onion pieces and it worked pretty well.It has a solid grip that works very well even when you need to press it very hard and I haven't slipped it once. The stainless steel body is of good quality and the hinges are well built. I used it reasonably everyday and didn't find any durability problem as of now. I also like the way one can flip the handle and use the plastic head to clean the pores. On the negative side, I wish there was a better way to clean the pores automatically after every press and I wish the head was bigger.The tool works fine till now and I am happy with it.I recently used another garlic press, the one from ikea, its equally good, only problem it found was that cleaning OXO is easier, other than that i found both equally good, and the ikea one being just 4$ is a cheaper option"
2,Feels Great---Until it Breaks,"I hate to bad-mouth OXO because I like the rest of their products. They cannot be beat for ergonomic comfort, and in that respect, the OXO Good Grips Garlic Press is no exception. The handles are extremely comfortable to grip, and with very small garlic cloves, minimal pressure is needed to crush them with this press. However, I have owned two of these OXO garlic presses, and both of them have broken while simply pressing a medium-sized garlic clove. The first time this happened, I though perhaps I had just gotten a defective press, and I optimistically purchased a second. Imagine my dismay when three months later, the exact same thing happened to the second press. Although this product looks big and sturdy, unfortunately, looks can be deceiving."
2,"Mine broke, too!","Great features (the comfortable grips and self-cleaning) but it is not durable at all. Hinge broke while crushing a small clove of garlic and the press was less than 3 months old! Certainly not overused nor abused by any means. Even hand-washed despite the fact they say it's dishwasher safe.The press ""looks"" like good quality stainless steel but I've never seen stainless ""snap"" like this one did. I know of two other family members whose OXO presses broke at the hinge, too.So, I will not be wasting my money on this brand. I'll go with a true stainless steel press until this manufacturer can improve on this one."
2,"OXOs stuff is generally quite good, but this is an exception","Overall, I've been very impressed with OXO tools. However, I have to say that this garlic press is a notable exception. It's just not built to withstand any kind of heavy use. If you put any medium or large-sized clove of garlic in it, you will break the press, it's only a matter of time. I've gone through 2 of them this way, and it's a shame, because generally OXO tools hold up much better than this."
3,"Lasted for years, then broke.","Our Oxo Garlic Press broke, too. First the red rubber/plastic ""spikes"" didn't fit in the metal (for pushing out garlic bits) anymore. ""Weird, I thought"" until it explained itself a few days later when the press broke completely. It gets 3 stars anyway because we used it regularly for a long long time (my wife says 6 years or so - she had it before we met!)The holes are pretty big, so it's not too hard to press garlic through it; but in the end I guess we did a dry-ish clove or two too many. I don't know if the newer ones aren't made a well of course; but I doubt it. As others have said - we're used to Oxo being great quality.Anyway: yes, it broke - but it lasted a good long time first and worked just fine until then, so that's worth 3 stars at least. Now we got a Kuhn Rikon press which does seem much studier. Over time we'll see if it's worth being twice as expensive."
2,"A little better than the Zusi 2, but not much","This press is considerably heavier than the Zusi 2 and has a bigger capacity, but although you don't have to have super-strong hands to use it, it requires bigger hands and more hand strength than I've got. If your hands are very large and strong, you'll probably like it, but if not, forget both of these and buy the Kuhn-Rikon Easy-Squeeze instead."
2,Worked for only three years,"I know I shouldn't complain too much since I used it for three years, but I just get upset when you buy a product that breaks after several years. It cracked on both sides of a handle and wouldn't put any pressure on the garlic to push through. I'm now on the market for a new one and don't recommend this one."
4,Good for the Cook,"I've had one of these presses from a few years and it recently failed. I sent an email to OXO and they promptly sent me a new one, no questions asked. Back in business and with service like that why would you buy anything else?"
2,Works fine until it breaks!,"Like a few others here have reported, the OXO broke right below the hinge. I would call it an average press with a better hand grip. The plastic hole clearer tended to stay lined up and worked ok. It broke while being used in normal service."
2,Worked OK... for a while...,"As a garlic press, this one is ok but not great. It leaves a fair amount of garlic behind in the press, though what makes it through comes out in nicely even small pieces. It can't seem to handle unpeeled cloves well either. Definitely not if there's more than one.But the biggest reason for my low rating is that, like several other people here, our press tore completely in two at the hinge after just a couple of years of modest use. We're about to buy theTrudeau Garlic Press, which was a best buy in Cooks Illustrated's latest review."
2,Broken hinge,We received a whole set of OXO tools as a wedding gift wears ago.This garlic press broke after three years of infrequent use. The metal snapped near the hinge. The rubber handles also slide off easily. Sounds like I am not the only one.The OXO kitchen scissors also fell apart after one month of use.
2,"Not recommended-wimpy, and bad handles!","I love garlic, and I thought this would be a great press. Not so much. My handles never leaked, as some reviewers have mentioned, rather they suddenly fell off completely, after maybe two years of moderate use. The metal handles inside are not pretty or comfortable--I use them in a hurry, but now I chop or slice the garlic by hand. I thought that the red attachment would be helpful for cleaning, but I don't find it to be significantly helpful. I also think that the reservoir that holds the garlic could be a little larger. I don't recommend this garlic press."
2,Weak,"Worked while it worked, but not sturdy enough -- hinge broke within a few months. Rubber handle bulky for my smaller hands. Rubber grip also tends to slip off.I had one zyliss last for 10 years, another about a year -- hard to know where to go for a press now but it's frustrating without one or, worse yet, a poor one."
1,It leaks and it broke,I only owned this for a year or so and it already broke. But I didn't like it anyway because of the leaking handles.
2,Very hard to use,"This is the first garlic press that I have ever had. The one thing that is inescapable is that it takes a lot of hand strength to use it. This fact is the overriding reason for my three-star rating. Admittedly, my hands are fairly arthritic, but it still takes a great deal of force to press the garlic through. For that reason alone, I would not recommend this tool for anyone experiencing ongoing pain in their hands; this press will surely aggravate it. The tool itself is sturdy and well made, although I'm also unimpressed with the cleaner feature; it still needs to be manually cleaned. The press goes through the dishwasher just fine. However, it's pricey to me at almost $15; it should be more like $10."
1,Broke in less than 3 months,Trust the other reviews. Mine broke just like the rest.Pros (before it broke) -- +4 stars.* Comfortable* Worked well (including the rubber bristle for cleaning the press)Cons -- -3 stars.* It broke in less than 3 months. Head area snapped off.Overall: 1 star...
1,"Yup, it broke.","I've had two of these and they have both broken at the hinge with only occasional use over a short time. I like Oxo, too, but this product is not worth it."
1,Broke After Little Use,Hardly used this press over the years...maybe a dozen time tops. Last week I put two old/small cloves of garlic in and the handle broke right off. I was stunned.
1,press was a mess!,"i had the same problem with our OXO good grips garlic press as many others here.1) the rubber handles needed to be taken off everytime we put this in the dishwasher.2) the red, plastic, cleaning attachment fell off of it too.so because of these two reasons it was a pain to get washed every time we used it. then yesterday, it broke and i had just bought it a year ago. it snapped in half! overall, it was not a pleasant experience. the next one i buy will have less attachments and a heftier construction."
3,Into the Trash it Went.,"I loved this garlic press. Nice wide grips-- probably good for folks with arthritis, etc. It has a good heavy-duty feel to it. I used it. Daily.I always handwashed. One day the red hole-poker fell off. A few weeks later the hinge went ""POP"" on a dinky but stubborn garlic clove. So, the garlic press is now swimming with the fishes and I'm back to mincing by hand."
3,"It May Break, But It's Still A Great Garlic Press!","I own this product and felt compelled to write as the OXO ""Good Grips"" garlic press has received very ""mixed"" reviews. I, too am on my second version of the product because the first one broke (at the hinge, which area seems to be the weakness in the product.)However, I did replace it with an IDENTICAL garlic press, because for as long as it worked, (about two years, with lots of use)it was fantastic, like the majority of the OXO ""Good Grips"" products. Hope this clarifies the ""mixed"" reviews this product has been receiving."
1,"Bad ergonomics, inefficient pressing, and cheap construction","I dislike this press for three reasons, and I don't recommend buying it. 1) The ergonomic design is poor--there's virtually no leverage on the garlic clove, and it takes quite a bit of hand strength to operate, even for my husband. 2) The plunger does not press the garlic clove all the way through, so there is significant waste left behind. I constantly find myself having to add an extra clove to a recipe to account for the unused garlic that inefficient press leaves behind. 3) Lastly, the metal material used for the hinges is poorly made. Due to #1, bad leverage, I found myself having to press both handles of the press against the counter (instead of squeezing it in my hand). The first one I bought broke the entire hinge, and the second one bent the hinge. I'm usually a big fan of OXO products, but this one is a loser."
1,not worth the $$$,"I have now gone through two of these. In both cases the hinge snapped when crushing garlic. Amazing. Additionally, the rubber handles have a tendency to slip off the metal and the hole cleaner actually makes the cleaning more difficult."
2,Not so good...,"I generally love Good Grips products, but this garlic press is not up to the standard of the other GG products. It does not fit together closely enough to press all of the garlic through the head - leaving a lot of unpressed garlic in the hopper. My Zyliss was damaged in the dishwasher (live and learn) but I am determined to get another."
2,Went back to OXO twice -- made from weak metal,"Although this is a nice looking product, and it lives up to the 'good grip' promise, I went back to the company twice for a new one after the metal broke apart at the stress point (the hinge).I will say that OXO stood behind their product, shipping out a new one with no fuss. But after getting two replacements, and seeing the third break in exactly the same place, I'm done."
1,Terrible product! Beware!,This thing broke after a couple of months. I recently started to notice it wasn't pressing easily and then suddenly the entire hinge broke snapping the arms apart. What a piece of junk! Don't waste your money or time.
2,It will break.,"As noted by many. If you use a lot of garlic--which I do--and do a lot of cooking--which I do--this will break by the joint. It is not stainless, but an alloy of a different nature.Other than that the comment on the handles is right on. They will fill with water and over time they slip off more and more. Don't be fooled by initial heft, feel, etc.I generally LOVE OXO, but they failed on durability here."
2,Breaks way to easy,"I loved this press for 3 months. Used it nearly every day. Then it just fell apart at the hinge. I am not Arnold. I am 60+ arthritic, do not work out and I used it easy. It should NOT have broken!"
3,"I loved it, but why did it break after only 3 years?","The OXO garlic press is great for crushing garlic. And I never had any problem with water in the handle, but of course, I don't run items like this through the dishwasher. However, I only gave it 3 stars because the metal hinge just snapped in half. I don't even use it that often, maybe once a week on average so it's very disappointing. I'm going to check other garlic press options before buying another OXO."
2,So so for Oxo,"As with most garlic presses much of the garlic stays in the press and even when you reverse it to push out the garlic with the little prongs you still end up scraping it out with a little knife. If you are pressing many cloves as I usually do and you don't scrape off the garlic on the outside before putting a new glove in, the handle can swing too far open grabbing all the garlic you just pressed out leaving it stuck in the prongs. This press is heavy in the hand but it takes a good amount of pressure to push the garlic through and it you have arthritis you probably would not be able to use this. The hinge part takes a lot of stress I would not put more then one clove at a time I think it would eventually snap off. Not my favorite item from a company that makes so many wonderful gadgets. I would much rather use my little grater and give it a rinse much faster and far less of a mess to clean. Not lovin this item."
1,Don't waste your money,Rubber handle grips will first accumulate water and later they will start comming off. It's so annoying that you will have to throw them away. At the end the hindge will brake and you will regret that you have spent your dollars on it.
1,thanks for the warning,"I collect all types of Garlic related items ,,, old and new. But I do want items that are functional and stand the test of time. Since I use alot of garlic in my cooking in my cooking forays I don't have a use for dysfuntuol tools. Thanks for the warning''' Pigfarmer"
1,not wanted,"nobody shoudl use a garlic press unless they must.As far as it goes this is fine, but do avoid if you can."
3,Be gentle,"This garlic press is better than most, particularly because the pressing head flips over to clear the crushing face -- a big plus compared to the zyliss and farberware presses, that you either have to pick clean or use a separate (included) tool. No thank you! I regularly crushed two cloves of garlic at a time in this press. However, I broke it while trying to crush ginger root. I think it's because this press is made of cast aluminum covered with chrome(?) plating. If you think you might be crushing lots of garlic or the occasional ginger root, go for the stainless steel OXO version. Well worth the additional $$."
4,It was good while it lasted,"I've actually owned this garlic press for almost 4 years and used it a couple of times per month. Always washed it in the dish washer. The red hole cleaner cracked loose within the first or second year, but the press functioned properly until recently. Lately it has become misaligned and it no longer does the job.Overall, it was a great Garlic press, but I too agree that it should have lasted longer than it did."
1,I thought it was just me,"Like many of the other reviewers, I have been a fan of OXO for years, and have purchased the Good Grips version of almost every item I've needed. Bread knife, check! Hairbrush, check! So I bought their garlic press many years ago, expecting it to be as wonderful as their other items, and, before long, it broke. I actually brought the broken one to their wholesale showroom in Manhattan, which probably no longer exists, and the replacement also broke. So, this is one OXO item I would not recommend."
2,Just OK and doesn't last,"After a couple of years we tossed our Oxo press into the garbage can. Early on, the rubber handles would slip off when in use or they be full of water from washing and leak water all over when in use (minor anoyances). After about a year the plastic cleaning face popped off and wouldn't stay on (bigger anoyance). Finally the press lost alignment and was useless (dead). It's performance and ease of cleaning were never very good and now that it's gone, we now have an excuse to find a different press."
3,good until it breaks,"My spouse and I really liked this garlic press. We didn't think it was too hard to clean - just average. We liked the rubber handles, they were comfortable. We had it for about 5 years and used it frequently. Then the metal broke just below the press, above the handle. There is no way to repair it unless you weld it, but even then, its strength would be compromised. So we threw it in the trash."
4,"Works great, but breaks","I've been very happy with my OXO Garlic Press over the 5 or so years I've used it. The problem is that over time, the metal hinge wears out and eventually breaks, leaving the press useless. I've had this happen with two different OXO garlic presses, so I know it wasn't just a bad batch. I did use it fairly often, so maybe that just comes with the territory. For the third try, I'm going to try the Zyliss Susi press instead."
3,Broke shortly after one year warranty period,While in usebut without any excessive pressure the hinge snapped leavingme with two pieces in my hands. I am so disappointed. I will not buyanother until I know that OXO has improved this fault. Naturallymine broke shortly after the one year warranty was up.I loved the comfort of using the press. I also loved theease in cleaning it...Wish it had been more durable.
3,Acceptable,"The Round Brush accessory doesn't work as well as I expected. When using it to dust off ceiling fans and blinds the inner bristles bent into the inside closing off the opening and trapping the dust. I had to take the brush off regularly and clean the dust from in, then bend the bristles back in place. Not a great design."
3,Sweet gourd pickle dreams,"I had a vision in my dreams the other night. I dreamed I was basking on the beach with a huge jar of Bitter Gourd Pickle with Garlic beside me. The smell of this wonderful product woke me with a stirring in my belly and I went right to my cupboard to make myself a delicious treat. How did I want to indulge myself this time. A little Bitter Gourd Pickle with Garlic on crackers? A peanut butter and Bitter Gourd Pickle with Garlic sandwich? Maybe some great coffee ice cream topped with Bitter Gourd Pickle with Garlic? Oh, my mind was alight with creative juices. But in the end, I decided to be a purist and ate it right out of the jar! Yum! While I like the product a lot, though, I feel it could be improved a bit with a few chopped walnuts to add texture. Hence, the 3-star rating."
3,Midnight Cravings,"Ok, I admit to midnight cravings - you know what I mean. You are lying on the couch reading a book and all of a sudden you have that sudden urge: gotta have some bitter gourd pickles NOW. This drives my husband crazy - he's getting tired of throwing on his clothes to make a trip to the all night convenience store just to buy me jars of gourd pickles. Good thing I found them here on Amazon!Everyone knows how tasty gourds are, and the fact that these are bitter makes them that much better. And the GARLIC really seals the deal - you can smell them in my perspiration for days! What a delicious reminder of those delightful gourd pickles.Only drawback - I can't give these 5 stars until they start packaging them in plastic jars. The mailman dropped my last shipment (literally)at my doorstep and now even the dog won't use this door!"
1,Worst Cookbook Ever,"I hate to disagree with the glowing reviews for this book but since I relied on the other reviews I had read to buy this book, I thought maybe a differing view would be useful. I am a seasoned cook and can say that this is one of the most poorly written cookbooks I have ever cooked from. I have made 3 recipes thus far. All have had major proportion issues and have lacked flavor. Even corrections I made as I went based on previous experiences could not save these recipes. If you like food that is basic in flavor (kinda like standard cafeteria fare) then you will probably like this book. If you like flavor in your food, then I suggest not buying this one."
2,One Mixed Up Mess,I am a fan of JSA but this book was an 80% disappointment...We learn that Thunderbolt has a son who is married to 'peachy pet' that cartoon character from the 40's Johnny Thunder...When in the heck did that happen.Shazam sends Captain Marvel off to find the Spectre..We only see him in three more panels fighting Superman and Batman..Where? How? Why? and we never do see The Spectre..Air Wave and the Green Lanterns go off on some wild escapade and suddenly disappear...There is a great story about Stargirl coming to terms with her family which is why it gets two stars instead of just one...A Bummer...
3,JSA in transtion,Not the strongest book of the series but still a must read to keep up with the story line. From the last book to this a lot has happen which was tied in with Infinite Crises story arc. It would seem the Spectre has been on the rampage and much turmoil has happen. Dr. Fate missing in action but without having to invest in all the other stories in the IC story arc this book is rather disjointed and empty.
5,great stories,"I like these heroes because they have glaring faults, inter-society squabbles and families"
4,Hold the Phone,"this looks like an absolutely great collection by a great band. but where is ""A House Is Not A Motel"". i know people always have problems with greatest hits selections, but that track is such a standout for these guys that I can't believe it's not here. perhaps the doors didn't want everyone to hear where they were stealing all their ideas and asked elektra not to include it..."
3,Doesn't make complete justice,"Love are clearly one of the most mysterious,fascinating and best bands of all time but first time listeners should go directly to their transcending first three albums(preferentially first to ""Forever Changes"",then to""Da Capo""and then to their debut""Love"")and not waste money in best ofs,especially one that leaves out so many essential tracks."
5,Never looked back,"This is the best waxing kit ever. I've used it ever since it came out and wax all areas (except head) with it. It's great!The wax gets warm very quickly (only 15 seconds so be careful not to leave it too long) and stays soft for a long time, so you don't have to keep it in a pot of warm water or anything so it doesn't get hard.It's also cheap because depending on how much you wax, the tube can last you for a long time. You don't even have to buy new strips, just rinse the used ones with hot water and hang to dry. A box costs $8-$10 while going to the salon can cost you maybe $20 for only one area (armpits/legs).If you have some troubles using this, I don't know what to say. I'm a clumsy person so if even I can do it then anyone should be able to."
1,It was aweful!!,"Okay so I decided to give waxing a try since shaving doesn't last and epilating ( I probably didn't spell that right) just wasn't my thing, and I can honestly say I HATED IT! Maybe it was just the product but the wax is SUPER messy and it pulls more on skin than hair! I mean you'll wax an area on your leg and u'll go through some pain and remove barley any hair at all. The wax doesn't stay heated long so by the time u finish waxing half of one leg u need to reheat it -_-. I do have to say that the sent is really pleasant but thats not enough of a reason for anyone to buy it. Maybe i'll try a different product for waxing but I must say this one is AWFUL!!"
2,Very disappointing,"I bought this wax and was so excited to use it last night. I am sick of shaving and for winter time, waxing seems ideal. It was horribly painful, pulling skin more than anything else. And to top it off, it removed some hair but broke off others so I wound up feeling like I hadn't shaved on a couple of days because I am covered with stubble!! It did remove about 3/4 of the hair, which is the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars. But the 1/4 it left behind, it simply broke off leaving a whisker feel. Not happy and will not buy again! The scent is pleasant and clean up is easy. That's all I can say about it. *sigh* Pain for nothing."
1,Deadly Knife,I have a dead knife. This is a dangerous knife. As I was cutting something the handle and knife broke. I was only cutting cheese. This should not happen with a good knife. I loved it until it almost caused me major damage. So be careful with this one.
4,Wonderful little knife for the price!,"I must say, for the very reasonable price of this knife, she's a beaut. GREAT handle...solid and comfortable to chop on and on. Nice rocking action. Nothing to dance in the streets about, but certainly a nice knife for a VERY nice price!"
4,A good knife,"Very good for the price... the handle is sooooo comfy and never slips. It could be a little sharper, but for the price you can't complain. Great for sometimes-cooks like me."
1,Spend a little more to get a lot better,"I LOVE OXO products. I think they are some of the best designed kitchen tools on the market. I started using OXO knives when I found a 6"" utility knife. That is a great knife. OXO makes many other great/good knives but this one is not worth the money. I was very excided to use it for the first time and when I did I noticed that the blade was flimsy, it was more like cutting with a sharp piece of sheet metal rather than using a sturdy knife. I would recommend spending a little more and getting a better knife."
4,An Owner's Guide to the Collie,This is a very informative book for any collie owner or prospective collie owner. It is very well-written and contains a lot of important topics concerning proper collie care and what to look for and expect when purchasing a collie. This book also has a lot of information regarding the collie temperment and how important it is to understand this facet of this breed. The pictures are wonderful! The information is very well organized and accurate. This book should be in Every Collie Lover's library.
3,super basic,"Nice little book, but super basic for those who have had dogs all their lives. There were a few interesting stories, specific to collies, that we found to be helpful. Not a bad book- read it in a day- should have went to the library for it."
4,Some thing different,I was introduced to Paul Q-Pek listening the the Hardcore/Punk group One Bad Pig. So this album was a bit of a shock because the style was not what I was expecting to hear. If you can't listen to any thing but the hard stuff don't by this album. But if you like melodic music this is a definite must. This album will not let you down.
3,Difficulty level extremely high,"No doubt, this is an excellent book. The problem with the book isn't so much the book itself, but the difficulty of the ideas and the syntax of Vos' writing style. I am left with the distinct impression that this book *cannot* be read casually or at leisure. It is a serious book that demands a serious reader. My review, then, is not so much a review, as much as it is a practical piece of advice for the interested reader. Be prepared to be confused, or at the least, to have to fight fiercely to gain an understanding of Vos's ideas. I will need to read this book again one day, as my first time reading wasn't too beneficial. Everything went over my head (whew! There, I said it! My darkest secret!), which is unfortunate for me, I'm sure."
2,DRAB,I found this book to be one of the poorer encounters of the Risorgimento. It certainly didn't grab my attention. She provides a lot of detail..perhaps too much but fails to draw the attention of the audience. I would suggest another book on the Risorgimento over Riall's account such as Derek Beales.
4,"4.5 Solid, Old-School Funk","Twelve killers on this disk, not a weak moment among them. It could've been passed off as a lost Meters record, or a Reuben Wilson & JBs session from 1969. Nasty, sleazy funk. Listen to this for a while, then ask yourself if you'd let your sister date any of these guys. I wouldn't. That bass player's got a real filthy mind."
4,Vintage funk sounds from this NYC collective,"Well i've had this CD in my possession for less than a day now, but after just one listen, I have to throw props to Calypso King and the Soul Investigators. I consider myself someone with pretty discriminating music tastes, always searching for some rare funk gems, something you would expect to hear as a DJ Shadow sample. For a modern album, this has a uniquely vintage feel to it - like you just dusted of the cover of an old 45 and gave it a spin. The vibe sounds vaguely like Greyboy Allstars or Galactic, if Galactic put out a record in 1971. If your into chilled out, laid back, old-school funk this album should be in your collection."
4,Still one of the best,"What's best about this game is the accurate, positive control, especially with a wheel and pedals. And if you're not afraid to edit a text file, you can make the computer drivers as tough or as easy as you like. The graphics are no longer cutting edge, but they are enough - it's the racing that matters, anyway. The 640x480 resolution is also not cutting edge, but it allows for a clear view of the track and the other racers. On a high resolution desktop, the view area is not full screen, but the workaround is simple: set the desktop to 640x480 and the game will fill the screen."
3,THINK PAST ANY ANTISEMITISM,"Regardless of what you think of the author's views on Jewish roots and influence...today, we do have an iron curtain over America. It is not woven by the Jews: it is the liberal main-stream media. They have learned the Big Lie Technique; they are an echo chamber unto themselves...see how often certain phrases can become the ""thought"" of the week and are found, exactly the same, across TV/radio/press. The media also uses the misinformation effect...please look it up. Media is successful in not only shaping public thought but planting their agenda...successful because we have 5th generation products of American public school ""education;"" factually ignorant but well-indoctrinated and propagandized. Unable to use logic as they think feelings are just as good, if not better...and opinions need not be verifiable to be held valid. Excuse me...time to watch American Idol...the Roman Circus of 21st century."
5,Dionne's First Arista Release Stands the Test of Time,"After a bevy of hits from Bacharach and David during the 1960's, Warwick was ending the 70's with little fanfare. However, when she got together with Barry Manilow, a winning combination was born. This is one of the best recordings from the 1979, if not the entire decade. Besides the monster hits ""I'll Never Love This Way Again"" and ""After You,"" the disc also has an outstanding rendition of the classic ""The Letter."" Up-tempo numbers include ""Who, What, When, Where, Why"" and ""Out of My Hands,"" a disco-perfect selection that features Warwick, as she does so well, providing her own background accompaniment.The piece de resistance, however, is ""Déjà Vu,"" a song co-written by Isaac Hayes and Adrienne Anderson. This Grammy-winning tune is one of the most stirring tunes ever written, a deft blend of soul and pop that showcases Warwick as being capable of sultriness while maintaining her unique classy style."
1,IMPROPER COVER TO DUPLICATE,"Ms. Warwick issued TWO albums titled ""Dionne"" creating this confusion. The first was in 1972 and is the other ""Dionne"" offering on the website with the proper cover. The cover on this offering is from 1979, but includes the tracks from the 1972 album. I was most disappointed when I found that both are not issued (unless the above track listing is erroneous). The track listing for the 1979 album with the above cover was: Who, What, When, Where, Why; After You; The Letter; I'll Never Love This Way Again; Deja Vu; Feeling Old Feelings; In Your Eyes; My Everlasting Lover; Out of My Hands; All the Time. WHAT A SHAME that album apparently has not been reissued."
1,Absolute Rubbish,I bought this book thinking I will get more knowledge about Discus keeping .But after going through the book I changed my opinion and think buying this book was absolute waste of money and time. Information given in the book is too general for any aquarium fish and not for Discus fish in particular. Not worth spending you precious money and time.
2,Just as it Says,"This book is, as it implies for the beginning discus keeper. I will go as far as to say that this book isn't only for beginning discus keepers, but for stark new aquarium keepers of any fish. There are only a few chapters that are related directly to discus fish, and of these most of the information is VERY general insomuch that it only relates to GENERAL fishkeeping. If you are NEW to the hobby I would recommend this book, but if you are experianced at all find another, more in depth study of the discus:)"
3,nice,I was interested in starting a discus tank and this book was very helpful. fill with good tips and ideas. I would have like more photos. But my tank is up and running well.
1,Poor value,"Nice shape. Good feel until you use it. Dipping hard ice cream is made difficult because the scoop lacks a full tang. I have washed it in the dishwasher 3 times and the non-stick became pitted, ruling out the dishwasher safe claim. Bottom line, too much money for not enough performance."
5,wonderful,"Received this as Christmas present from my son and it is the most wonderful robe I have every had. It is so light weight, but warm and the softness is just great. Good choice for a bath robe"
5,Fantastic purchase,"I bought this for my husband and am so impressed. Nice and thick, and incredibly soft and huggable. I have not seen anything nicer when looking in department stores. The attention to detail that went into the packaging was also a complete and welcome surprise. Sturdy shipping box, and the inside was packaged nicely enough to present as a gift with no wrapping really required. There was even a hand-written thank you note included. I am more than satisfied."
4,Good Bathrobe,The megasoft bathrobe is pretty soft and thick relative to other bathrobes. It has a nice feel to it. The bathrobe is made of Japanese yarn and the yarn is made of cotton so the bathrobe is made of 100% cotton. Cotton of course strinks in the wash but the strinkage is tolerable. I purchased the expresso color and after a few washes the color faded but that is to expected. Overall I am satisfied with this purchase and would purchase it over again if I had the choice to do so.
2,"Overpriced, too small","I've had this robe for about a month now. The color is nice and it was reasonably soft out of the box. However, it's been washed twice now, and is covered in pulled threads, and feels like a cheap, thin towel. No softness at all, even when rinsed with a good fabric softener. Also, it's not very big - almost too small for me, and would never fit my husband. Compared to the robe it replaced, which lasted 15 years and was still soft, albeit coming apart, this one is way overpriced. I doubt it will last a year before being replaced. Skip this one, folks."
1,robe that is falling apart,"Nice looking, cozy robe, but started to fall apart within a week. Left a voice message for the company, no response. Was out of town, but now back and will re-attempt contact.Doug Miller480-262-0746"
1,NOT IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS,"I have never had any problem with Amazon. I swear buy them. I have been cautious with their third party sellers. However, still no complaints. This seller waits until 5 days from Christmas to tell me my robe is in customs and wont be available. In stock should mean in stock! E-mail response "" I wanted to give you an update on this so that you will have the time to complete your Christmas purchases"". Thank you, IT DID. I HAD TO PAY $40( in shipping) TO HAVE ANOTHER ROBE SENT OVERNIGHT! THANKS FOR NOTHING BUT A HEADACE!AND -$40 BE WARRY!"
2,serious student,"First of all I was expecting a case to case study with answers given professionally on every case presented. But the answers are to be provided by the reader..... That was a big bummer! Secondly the book had (and still has despite everything I did against it), a very strong old tobacco smell which is the most unpleasant when you are repulsed by cigarette smoke. So that makes me a disappointed customer."
2,1974 Edition,"This book is a 1974 edition with a older style cover. I was expecting a newer style cover picture, it is in good condition. However I was expecting a more up to date cover."
2,not the best,"Personally, I did not find this book helpful or uplifitng - the content is too ""fluffy"" during a time when difficult decisons are being made. Might be a better read down the line after the divorce is final and you are moving on. Maybe it's the book for you if you are a big Debbie Ford fan. Books can be trial and error - this was an error for me."
5,saved my children,"I found this book while going through my own divorce after 22 years of marriage, and I can honestly say it changed the trajectory of my life. Full of fear and rage, I imagine I would have unknowingly placed my children smack in the middle of the battle. Instead, Debbie walked me through an incredible step by step process that allowed healing and growth and the ablility to help my girls through that painful time. Using the tools in this book, I was able to understand that I could choose my perspective about how this divorce would affect me, which in turn would affect my daughters. Without Debbie's book I don't think my ex and I would be friends today or be able to still spend time together (all four of us) as a family. This is a MUST read for anyone going through or considering a divorce."
4,Read it Over and Over,"As a guy who was going through a painful divorce, this book was a Godsend. Although portions of it might be described as ""psycho-babble"", for the most part it is nothing other than gold. The chapters on ""Acceptance"" and ""Surrendering"" changed my healing process dramatically and forever changed my perspective on life. In the darkest times of the divorce, I found myself going back to the book time and time again."
1,not what I expected,"I bought this for my daughter-in-law to help her find God's purpose in her life as she goes through this difficult time. What this book does is teach New Age theology and is not Biblical, and the author names her ""god"" Universe. I returned the book."
2,Lightweight,"If you like gushy mushy gab about relationships, love, and forgiveness, all told in parables and ancedotes, you'll love this book. The slant is from the issue of divorce but it is like thousands of other self-help books out there. If you want practical, analytical help don't buy this book."
5,This book is a must read if you are going through a divorce,"Debbie Ford shares her divorce experience throughout the book. She explains how her own divorce awakened her spiritually. I found great comfort in this book. It guides you on a journey of self reflection. During divorce, when we are feeling most vulnerable, it is easy to feel like the victim and blame our spouse for the demise of the marriage. After reading this book, you will learn how to forgive your spouse not for his sake, but for your own. Ultimately the anger we harbor for another will always cause us our greatest misery. By releasing these negative emotions you will come away feeling empowered and better able to cope with your divorce."
3,Easy but boring,This is a great book for someone who has never been aware of their spiritual nature through out a divorce. I found it redundant and a bit boring a slow read. I read alot of Deepak Chopra books. i got the impression she was trying to mimic his style - not possible. I then learned that she was a student of his. It may resonate with you I hope that it does. Best of luck to you in your transition to a good life.
1,New Age Jumbo,"I love to read, and I read very well, but this book is difficult to follow. It is wordy, contains one analogy after another and quotes from various people, all of which confuse the point the author was trying to make. I started reading it thoroughly, then began skimming, then reading the first sentence or two of paragraphs that weren't describing the author's divorce, then I finally quit, and threw it away. I hate to throw away a book, but this one is blather."
5,This Book had a Profound Impact On My Life!,"I have never been married but I've gone through enough painful break ups to really want this book. It's through this book that I finally saw a way to work through my pain, loss, and grief. I can finally say that since I've read this book my whole view on relationships has changed and transformed. I've never been more excitied and thrilled to engage in a brand new relationship. I 'm blessed that this book showed up at the perfect time in my life."
3,Just Okay -,"I've read several books on divorce trying to get through mine. This is one book that I just didn't get much out of. The author had not had a long term marriage when she divorced. She lived with one partner, then lived with another, got pregnant, married, and then divorced after a short time. This was just nothing like my situation so I suppose that's why I didn't finish the book. I'd been married 30+ years when I discovered my husband had been unfaithful most of the marriage. This book just seemed too New Age for my level of anger/betrayal. The book that most helped me so far is When He Leaves. However, I'm sure this book is helpful for lots of open-minded younger people."
3,The Evening Stat,Somewhat of a disappointment when compared against other McMurty books. Slow at times but gets better toward the end. It does not compare to Last Picture Show.
4,Really Cute and Funny,"The appeal of this anime lies in the cute character designs and the dialogue. Not very much actually happens here. It's mainly just the characters sitting around and talking to each other. But their conversations and personalities make the show pretty funny. There is a character in this series that is obsessed with the Haruhi Suzumiya anime. I think that's kinda funny since the voice actor was the same as in that series too. There's not really much to tell about Lucky Star, but even if that's true it's still pretty cute and funny. You may like if you give it a shot."
5,Lucky Star Vol. 1-3,I had no problem with my purchase. I ordered next day shipping and it got here on time.
3,Not that really good,"I bought this special edition because I was flashed by all the extra items it offers you, but they're not that cool, let's start with the Shirt (XL) why not medium at least? I wonder what did they based on to decide that size... and plus, this is the girls uniform print, there's more chance for a girl to wear this shirt than a guy, so in this case so why an Extra Large size :( The chocolate cornet it's ok, it has a wipe inside, I'd rather this wipe to have the characters printed on it than the name in English. But I loved the box, It looks so nice and cute :3"
3,"Too large out of the box for standard storage, but can be trimmed fit.","Originally I gave these 1 star because the default dimensions make them too long to fit upright in any of my 3 storage systems. I basically have a high quality metal cabinet by Can-Am made specifically for CDs, but the jewel sleeves are too tall to close the drawer. I also have glass front cabinets which I can't close either. Even the cheap cardboard storage boxes I use for short term storage I have are too shallow for the tops to stay on securley when filled with jewel sleeves.However, if you fold one edge of the tray card under, and trim off the excess of the jewel sleeve using a straight edge and an exacto type knife it will fit perfectly in any of my storage systems.I would give these 4 stars if they fit without the trimming, which can get very time consuming with a large collection like mine."
3,"AEG Electric UZI Sub Machine Gun FPS-200, Scope, Tactical Light, Laser, Foregrip Airsoft Gun Review","This gun's OK. It was plastic,light and kind of flimsy. It's laser-sight broke and it doesn't shoot very far. Also the scopes just for show because the bbs are really inaccurate. If your looking for a starter gun this one is great because its easy to use and it doesn't hurt unless you are very close."
3,incorrect product dimensions,the dimensions listed in the description of this product are incorrect. I purchased this item thinking that it was a large remote with large buttons. It is shown as 13 x 6 x 1.5 inches. This is the approxamate size of the PACKAGE not the item. The actual item is about 8 x 3. I cannot rate the actual item as I am returning it to the seller
2,Cute but not quality,The material this is made of just does not hold up when thrown in a purse all the time. The material frays all over the place and looked tacky within a month or two. I did not contact the manufacturer (I guess I should have) and just threw it in a bag for Goodwill. I would not recommend this for others!
4,Informative and well written,"This book feels like sitting with Neil Gunn and sharing a wee dram as he relates the history of whisky and extols its virtues. The reader learns how the manufacturing of good whisky is fundamentally at odds with modern means of production. This is a delightful read and a must for anyone with an interest in whisky, especially Single Malt Whisky. Gunn's writing is fine, though the conversational tone of the book may put off some fans of Gunn's fiction. The beautiful prose of Highland River is replaced by a warm and inviting conversational tone. Highly recommended."
5,knife switch-top post,the produce worked well and it fit my motor home. It was easy to install on the batteries for my motor home. This prevents ghost voltage charges which drained my batteries when the motor home was not in use
5,Handy Battery Cutoff,"Also can help with theft prevention & keep battery current drain from killing your car ortruck battery, especially if vehicle often sits for long periods. This knife-type disconnectis one of the easiest and quickest."
2,problems with the display,"After about a week, parts of the numbers on the display were no longer visible. I'll try to get it replaced. Let's see what happens next."
3,html 4th edition,I haven't read the book. Does any one recommend it? But HTML 4th Edition by Elizabeth Castro is extremly helpful
3,Too many errors,"This book does provides a good overview of networking principles (IP addressing schemes, net masking, OSI layers, etc.) and other topics beyond memorization of HTML tags. Unfortunately, there are also a number of glaring errors in the text and chapter practice tests in this book; errors that leave me frankly astonished and frustrated with my test preparation routine. (...) I am unaware of any other test prep books for the CIW Foundations Exam, so this book may be your only choice... but be forewarned!"
3,Bad information,"The book had alot of incorrect information, one being about the two main subcategories of DSL, it should have read ADSL and SDSL not VDSL and ADSL. Also I had a question on the test about a type of virus that was not even mentioned in the book and not to mention thast the book was writen very poorly with all types of grammer errors."
2,Do not rely on this book alone to pass the exam,"This book gives detailed descriptions of topics where only a general knowledge is required for the test, whereas other important topics (like e-commerce, copyright and trademarks, firewall topology and the hacker process to name a few) are left out completely. The book also has too many errors and typos.Unfortunately it is the only Foundations book out there at the moment. If you decide to buy it, be prepared to do a lot of research on the net to find the info missing in this book."
2,Not Map to the Exam Objectives,"As a Ceritifed CIW instructor, I'm sometimes asked by students as to which books are suitable to augment the already comprehensive official curriculum. I've looked at the ones currently out there, and this book unfortunately, does not meet many of the mapped objectives. For example, the over emphasis of Networking seems to be about an introduction course the the Cisco CCNA rather than the book trying to give an overview of the CIW objectives. Subsequently, because of the undue weightage, the other objectives suffer, and notably, the HTML section which is briefly skimmed through.While this book might give some additional info for those who have an added interest in networking, nevertheless, I feel that there are other books out there that give much more networking info and cost the same."
3,CIW Foundations Exam Cram (Exam: 1D0-410),"If your thinking of doing self-study alone to pass the Foundations exam, this book is certainly helpful. The cramsession web-site also has some good pdf downloads. Unfortunately there are many mistakes (which are only obvious as you read other sources) and some misleading question / answers. However, if used in conjunction with other e-commerce / firewalls / html references and online exams, you should pass. I recently took the exam and found 40-45 questions matched the cert21 exam questions."
5,Long Knife,This is the greatest non-fiction historical novel of the last two centuries. I will bring the incredible significance of this writing in relation to a Take Back of America as the Patriot in the near future. The incredible efforts of George Rogers Clark interact into present day perils for our country. ... soon the General will pop up in present day America.God Bless America.
4,LONG KNIFE,"The third book of James Alexander Thom that I have read this year. They were all great. Lot of history that was great to read about. A book you can't wait to get done, but don't want it to end."
2,Couldn't keep me interested . . .,"I have read several historical books in the past year. My dissappointment in this book stems from the fact that it spent too much time in the early going describing General Rogers' physique and general superhero status. I quickly lost interest in the subject. Still, I am interested enough in the subject and the historical time period that I may seek out other relevant books. My first reading experience with a James Alexander Thom book was, unfortunately, not a good one."
4,"Commitment, triumph, and disillusion","Great book! If you want to understand the sacrifices and struggles our forefathers bore to build this nation, this is one is a must read."
1,Terrible Vacuum,"Bought this brand new, first time I used it the suction dropped to very little after the filter got clogged. I vacuum everyday so the rug was not overly dirty. Had to remove and clean filter, also there is a foam filter that you have to wash very very frequently (eventually I took it out because of suction problems). Use the wand? Forget it, the suction is so bad it won't pick up a crumb on the floor.I am very sorry I bought this vacuum. They brag about the suction being better than a Dyson, in there dreams.I use my hoover that has a bag and is 15 yrs old and get more suction than this one."
4,A must-have for the seafood lover...,"Like most Oxo products, this seafood set is of excellent quality.It also turns out to be very handy when you need to deal with claws: first you crack them and then you extract the juicy meat with the tiny forks, which have two different tips: a fork and a spatula.And it also handles the dishwasher very well."
4,nice set,A very nice set - the only complaint I would have would be not so much a complaint but an observation that the cracker is seemingly designed for larger shells. It is not as effective for smaller pieces unless you place them and attempt to hold them in place right in the middle of the unit where the two pads come together and actually make contact. It is very heavy duty and comfortable though and does just fine. The only modification I'd recommend to OXO would be to design the cracker to come closer together at the hinged end. I'd still get it again though if anything happened to it.
4,Universal power supply,Works very well with the different items I have used it with. One higher power laptop caused the power supply to get a bit hot but it kept functioning just fine. I like the overall versatility and the fact you can use the cables for things like data transfer and even connecting other devices that don't require power. Overall very useful in my job as a computer repair technician. The variety of tips provided as well as the ability to purchase additional tips has been very helpful.
4,duh!,"I cant see buying this without knowing what it is.For what it is, gay fiction/porn, it's good. Some is really great but none of it insults the reader. I liked this book and was surprised it was as good as it was. Ford holds his own with the best in the genre.Thanks Michael."
1,Boring,"What a complete waste of talent and a total bore. Ford is a very talented and gifted writer. I thoroughly enjoyed his ""Looking for It."" I was hoping for more of the same.Instead, this is a compilation of thirty ""erotic"" or ""porn"" stories. I don't need, much less ""enjoy,"" this kind of graphic fantasy. After all, there's only so much any author can do with the same graphic details of gay sex before it all blurs into the usual ""oh."" After the third instalment, I tossed the book.If you want extremely graphic gay porn in narrative, this ""trash"" or ""tintilation"" might appeal to you. Ford is an extremely able writer. But even his spin on thirty gay fantasies wasn't going anywhere with me -- fast."
4,A great party disc,Good things come in small packages. This small packages is the perfect collection of amped up covers that everyone knows and everyone loves. It doesn't get much better than the title track cover of Nena's 99 Red Balloons.
5,Great Filter @ a Great Value!,It was time to change out the old filter in my Pontiac G6 GT so I decided to make it a one time purchase with a washable K&N Filter. I would say it was a definite improvement over what came from the factory. The engine sounds better and I noticed a slight improvement in acceloration at high speeds. Solid Amazon buy.
5,Makes a Difference,"I can't attest to any mileage differences with my 07 Malibu SS, but insofar as speed/acceleration and such, it appears to be an excellent product. If I punch it, the sound of the air rushing into the engine with its powerful acceleration seems to have justified the purchase."
1,Looks Nice - Doesn't Work,"This reamer looks nice and is easy to clean, that's where my good comments end. This tool is too smooth to properly ream citrus. It just spins around with very little juice coming out of the lemon. Best reamer is a plain wood one. The wood has enough texture to properly ream and makes for a good grip.Most markets sell them for under $2.00"
3,I prefer the wooden lemon reamer,"Somehow, the edges aren't sharp enough, so it doesn't work that well. I purchased a wooden one at some later point, and I tend to favor it since it seems less slippery and has sharper edges."
3,Wooden Version is Better,"I second what other cooks have stated here. OXO's wooden version of this citrus reamer is much better and three dollars cheaper to boot. The grooves on the wooden reamer are deeper and sharper and ""catch"" the sides of the fruit better, getting more juice out."
3,it's ok,the series is very energetic and uplifting however i do believe that there should be a statement identifying that flexibility and uneffected movement is necessary in other words if you can't move well this is not for you recommend that the producers provide alternate movement or positions can be used
4,Yoga Booty Ballet,"My wife has lost a total of 12 lbs after eating better and starting Yoga Booty Ballet. She has become more tone and energetic. She likes the way that it combines cardio, ballet, yoga and weights in one package. It is definitely a total body workout. At first it is hard to catch on at the pace they things but eventually you get it ."
3,Uh.....,"I can't speak for the quality of the workout itself, because I didn't last that long. The women leading the workout were just so annoying I couldn't take it, so I turned it off. It could be the greatest workout ever for all I know. But I have a low tolerance for over-the-top bubbly/goofy too perky types. And some of the moves were just plain silly. I just kept thinking ""what drugs are these chicks on???"" Anyway, if that type of personality motivates you, by all means buy it. It just doesn't motivate me. All I was motivated to do was climb through the tv, tie them up, and put tape over their mouths. haha!"
1,Boring,"If you enjoy yoga for fitness but not for its religious aspects, then this prbably isn't for you. Prepare to spend a lot of time breathing out fear, repeating mantras and intentions, envisioning light flowing into you from the universe, etc. I'm not trying to critique others' beliefs, but they should let you know in the ads that this aspect is so prominent in what is supposed to be a workout video.I'm a fairly advanced user, very active with a lot of cardio and yoga experience. I would not recommend this for beginners - it's hardly a workout, but the moves are confusing. The camera work is terrible, with narcissitic close-ups when they should be showing you moves. You often can't see what they're doing & the verbal cues are useless. Whether they call the workout hip-hop or caberet, the music is always non-stop Indian drumming with no variety among 4 workouts. There are a lot of better yoga and cardio workouts out there."
4,Great Fun!,"Ok, so I don't actually own THIS set of DVDs. I own YBB Total Toning Basics & Advanced Fat Burning, Cardio Caberet: Burlesque Style and Hip Hop Abs. I saw these on an infomercial and ordered the set. I was a little concerned because they are based on dancing, which I cannot do. I have no dancing background and have never danced at all (not even prom or school dances) so I wasn't sure I would be able to follow these. But Gillian and Teigh make it so much fun that you forget about not being able to dance and just do it anyway. After a few times you get much more comfortable with the routines and just let go and have fun. You'll feel like you're in class with them.I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because it's not really quite as much work or as much dancing as I would have liked. Because I don't know how to dance and I found the dancing parts of these videos to be so much fun, I would have liked for them to be longer. All in all, a great set. I love it."
3,It's OK for Beginners,"This was an OK video for when I was trying to get into working out again after being pretty inactive for a few years.It was great for the first two months and then I started getting really annoyed by the perkiness of it all- I can only take so many references to my ""booty"" and being encouraged to ""work yer unique THANG!"" =) Plus I was feeling like I wasn't really getting a challenging workout- I wanted something that was a real cardio workout-- the YBB cardio is just too short. I've moved on to Women Health's DVD's and they are without a doubt a superior workout if you're looking for something more challenging in terms of cardio and sculpting."
2,I wanted to like it but...,"I hardly burned any calories. I kind of liked the basic workout. My only complaint there is the section where you use weights I have to vary the pounds b/c obviously a bicep curl with 3 pounds just will not do any good whatsoever. That was annoying to have to switch out. I did not like the advanced workout and I also tried some of the other workouts and they were just too ""dancy"" for me. I prefer turbo jam or tae bo."
3,No sweat,"I enjoyed doing these videos. The dance/cardio segments are fun, the instructors are perky, but they are too short. I don't feel like I worked out. The ballet part was o.k., but I didn't like the yoga part. It was hard to follow the modified positions for those of us who are not that flexible. I will be looking for videos with harder cardio, and plain yoga videos."
4,Complete At-Home Workout System,"This includes a meditation and stretching module, unlike other home workouts I've done. I use at home exercise DVDs during inclement weather when I can't walk outside, my favorite exercise. This is a fun workout."
4,Spice Up Your Workout,"I've been out of a good exercise routine for months and needed something to get me excited about exercising again. This series of videos has done the trick. It gives a good workout, unique moves, funky music....none of the videos are a long commitment. The stars of the video are a little dry but the moves and exercises definitely target what you need to target.You will need small weights for some of the sculpting sections, as well as a squishy ball for others (although a small ball or pillow will do the trick for those exercises)My one negative comment is that the ""how to"" part is a bit overlooked for a beginner; often going quickly from one pose to another without good video footage or verbalization. I found this a bit frustrating to keep up, but hopefully after a few weeks, it will all come more naturally and the routines will go more smooth for me."
3,A little lame but I did break a sweat,"Like the other reviews, I have to admit it's super corny. I had a hard time getting through some of it because I'm pretty much the opposite of perky. However, I'm not one to say without dedication this wouldn't work. I know I broke a sweat everytime I used it. It's not crazy high impact but it does get your muscles going. If I couldn't give anyone who bought this and hates it any advice, it would be to just see it as a personal challenge. Forget the ladies and their perky moodra stuff, and focus on mastering the moves and the technique. Learning the moves is all that reall matters."
2,"It might work, but it isn't what I was expecting","Yoga Booty Ballet Complete Workout SystemIf you are expecting a mostly dance workout or a workout where you won't need to get on the floor and do situps then this is not the workout for you. This could have been my mistake, but I didn't think I would be spending long periods of time sqatting, doing leg lifts, and doing situps while squeezing a ball. Those are all the same exercises I've been told to do for ages and I hate them but they're here in Yoga Booty Ballet. One of the DVDs is more of a herky jerky dance dvd, but it all leads back to the same old exercises at the end. On top of it all, the music is dull and rather off beat most of the time.I believe this workout will produce results if done continually because it IS filled with a lot of the moves we already know to be affective, but this is not a fun, innovative, energy filled dvd. It is just another exercise tape."
2,would not buy this again,"its a lot more yoga than ballet. the two women are really cheesy and like to say groovy. if i had a do-over, i would not buy this again. if youre looking for more of a ballet work out, i found nyc ballet II to be fun and challenging."
2,Wasn't what I expected,"Typical As Seen On TV quality.Lots of marketing to sign up for other programs and merchandise.Some may really enjoy it, it just wasn't for me."
2,Should have known from the title,"I bought this because I have turbo jam which I love. I thought this would be good too because it's by beach body. I was wrong - I didn't like this one at all. I thought the instructors were as cheesy as the title, the moves were weird and not easy to follow. I've taken many different yoga classes and this seemed like they made up they're own version. Would NOT recommend."
2,Not an iota of authenticity,"If you are looking for a Yoga, Ballet and yes, even booty-licious workout, I recommend you buy three different workouts instead of YBB. Yogis are literally rolling over in their graves at these ladies. This is so typical nowadays, to find irreverence in everything. I would suggest renting this before buying. I rented and am so glad I did. My eyes were rolling the whole time and many of the cardio ""booty"" workouts are just awful--literally ridiculous. The changes they make to moves and the speed they start at in the intro video might actually injure someone less limber. There are way better videos out there, for less money too--these ladies just have better marketing behind them."
1,"NOT Original Redcordings, Remastered","I blame the confusion on Amazon. Whereas the label likely thinks that ""original recordings""of the Prague Philharmonic being ""remastered"" covers them legally , it is ridiculously misleading. In the recordings world, such a descriprion always means the original recording, after some production work to improve the sound. Not a remake of a remake. Change the caption for this CD!"
1,"this is a joke, right?","How anyone would think this set does justice to any of the selections? It simply isn't possible to describe how painful it is to hear this rendition of Blazing Saddles. Please, don't buy these CDs you'll only encourage them to make more - thankfully I didn't purchase the set, instead I listened to a few tracks on Yahoo Music Unlimited."
2,Not My Style,"This CD has a lot of good songs on it, but it just too bland for our taste. We prefer Western music to sound as though genuine cowboys are singing it - not a fancy chorus!"
4,Western Music,"I enjoy this CD. It has many familiar melodies. Good background for reading, nice to listen while driving. It is also the only CD I've ever found that has the great theme from the movie ""Giant."""
5,A Second Serving of Westerns...,"""Way Out West"" is the second offering of ""The Essential Western Film Music Collection"" as performed by the City of Prague Orchestra. Thirty-eight items are on offer here, none duplicated from the first collection, ""The Wild West"".The selection is wide and deep, with theme music ranging from television's ""The Big Valley"" and ""Bonanza"" to spaghetti westerns ""For a Few Dollars More"" and ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"" to more recent films such as ""The Quick and The Dead"" and ""Unforgiven."" The quality of the music is good to excellent. Total running time is well over two hours for the two disks. ""Way Out West"" is very highly recommended to fans of Western TV and film theme music."
3,Adult Fairy Tale,"This book is really more of an adult fairy tale; very dreamlike in its narration. It does, however, have beautiful prose and lyrics and is so well written by, I believe, a first-time author. It relates the bizarre relationship between a father and son, the strange behaviour of a young gifted girl and a painting that binds the characters together. At the beginning, the book was engrossing, it soon petered out towards an unsatisfactory conclusion. The book is extremely well written, but I'm not fond of one-dimensional characters and surreal storylines."
3,Four Letters of Love,"I purchased this novel for Book Club. Unusual style of writing for a male author. Very descriptive landscape scenes, but abrupt emotional descriptions of human characters. Enjoyed the last few chapters the most."
2,Trys to hard,"Niall Williams admits in the interview he tried to make every sentence perfect in an attempt to get this book published. As I writer myself, I know that you can try too hard and rewrite too many times. Williams' writing and sentence structure taken in small doses are dazzling but grouped too closely together, the shine is lost. The plot and characters are also veiled by the flowery, gem-like sentences one after another. As for the ending, it lacked a strong finish to satisfy the imagination."
5,Magical,"A beautiful storty. Four Letters of Love is filled with sorrow and grief, love and romance, and the overwhelming power of destiny. Williams has given me hope that someday, I too, will meet my soul mate."
4,Good Flashlight,"I've had this flashlight for about 4 years. I purchased it because of its visor clip; it allowed me to mount it on a visor and shine it on a GPS system sitting on the car dash. Nice and bright, no problems after 4 years."
1,NO COMPRES,"DO NOT BUY THESEthey do not stay onthey are flimsy, and the headband part is as soft as a piece of yarn- no stability at all.the cord is too shortthe sound is mediocre at bestno matter how carefully you wedge them behind youre head they do NOT stay putthe detachable parts fall off every time you take a step. forget about running in them!"
4,Good Intro to Cajun Music,"As one who is an uneducated fan of Cajun music, I can vouch for ""Encore Encore"" as a good introduction to the genre. Perfect for the stereo for an outdoor barbeque, BeauSoleil tosses off traditional two-step with ease (""Le Chanky-Chank Francais""). This is the kind of good-time Cajun music you associate with bowls of jambalaya and gumbo on a sweaty Louisiana night, and it's a lot of fun.BeauSoleil is not a one-note pony, however, and ""Encore Encore"" shows off some of the band's different influences. ""Conja"" and ""A Bebe Waltz"" are two examples of tunes that don't fit the stereotypical Cajun tune, but they are also lots of fun.I'm not sure what would be a five-star intro to Cajun, but if you want to get a good, representative album that gives you a sense for the music, both its classical forms and its various tangents, ""Encore Encore"" would be for you."
4,Best smartphone,"I have had at least 10 different types of Smartphones. I have been using this phone for about 6 months and it is without question the best. The only negative--if you use the screen a lot, the battery life is not as strong as I would like. Every phone I have tried has this same problem."
4,interesting read,Had to read this book for a law school course. I ended up finding it compelling and very interesting. I would recommend this book to friends as it was a very enjoyable read. It was always quite helpful in learning about the law and the inner workings of our government.
5,Excellent and Inspirational,"I could not more highly recommend any book! The story is told in a manner that is thoroughly compelling. As the students prepare to work with the refugees, the author provides the reader with snapshots of the struggles facing the refugees. The cast of students is highly inspirational. I would recommend this book to all law students, especially those interested in asylum law or immigration more generally. As a law student who spent a semester in my school's immigration clinic, much of the frustration and joy I felt was also experienced by the students in this book. I only wish I had read it before starting clinic!"
1,Pillow not as pictured on Amazon,"The pillow I received does NOT look like the one pictured. It is sewn on a MUCH darker ground fabric, more kahki brown than white. The darker ground color does not enhance the stitched pattern and colors. I was terribly disappointed by the ground color although the embroidery was as I expected."
5,Great knife for a great price,"We use this knife all the time to cut fresh baked bread from our bread maker. It has a great grip to make it easy to use. It cuts the bread pretty cleanly, even when it is warm from the oven. Great purchase, at a great price"
4,Good for the price,Pretty sturdy. Have used it to cut more than bread and did a fine job. Not of the highest quality but very good knife at a good price.
4,knife,"I purchase a bread machine and needed a knife to cut my newly made bread. I find this one, and am very happy with it, cuts my freshly made bread very well."
1,Great Handle LOUSY Blade,"While this product has a great handle that is comfortable to hold and easy to handle, the blade is so poorly made that it destroys the usefulness of the knife. You are much better off buying a good knife from a manufacturer with experience in making blades. Don't waste your money!"
5,"Great knife, I want another just so I don't have to wash it between cutting stuff","This knife cut through my crusty bread like it was butter. Haven't had such a good bread knife in years, I'm getting another so I can cut something else without having to wash it."
2,BORING BORING BORING,Don't waste your time reading this book. It was very predictable. It just seemed to drag on and on. It seems like Kat Martin took ideas from other books and put them into this one. It gets boring to read the same old stuff written over and over again.
5,Couldn't put it down!,"Reading Kat Martin again was a real pleasure. The story of Kitt and Clay was really intriguing with the twists and turns. When two people meet and there is an instant flaring of the senses, you know that it is only a matter of time before the sparks fly and passion ignites. This was the kind of book I just couldn't put down. I read it in line at the supermarket, gas station and even at a long red light.I am really looking forward to her next book. Fanning the Flame that is due to be released in August 2002. Way to go, Kat. Keep 'em coming."
1,Where Was the Author?,Kat Martin has written some very good books. This book is not one of them. It has neither well-developed characters (to call them one-note would be giving them more resonance than they have) nor a credible plot. Good cookbooks have more genuine passion. I hope she was producing (not writing) this disappointment while on autopilot thinking about a forthcoming novel worty of her skills.
1,yawn,"I am a total Kat Martin fan. I absolutley love her, but the problem with this book, is that it goes no where! I can barely turn the pages without falling asleep. Her best book, by far, was Devil's Prize. It was packed with drama, some mystery, and suspense! This book was just too boring for my taste!"
2,"More like ""The Fire Died""","I read Hot Rain, Martin's contemporary romance, so I wasn't expecting much in the way of plot. However, the characters in Hot Rain did maintain great chemistry, which unfortunately was not the case for The Fire Inside. The hero and heroine begin with a sizzle, even though their verbal battles weren't near as fascinating to me as other reviewers seemed to find them (The heroine says ""You're incorrigable!"" several times throughout the book). The chemistry dies off about halfway through the book, and to make it worse, the heroine is a complete [...]. I had to throw the book down when Kitt came breezing back to London expecting Clay to simply forgive and forget the fact she had left for months on end without an explanation. I can't tell you how the book ended (I couldn't bear to finish it), but I can probably guess. If you're in the mood for a coookie-cutter romance, go ahead, but I felt compelled to warn everyone..."
3,Along for the Ride,"Good songs, good musicianship, but a bit disjointed. This is,obviously, a collection of music that features musicians and(in some cases) song writers that Mayall had worked with in thepast. All the songs are good in and of themselves, but they seemedto have just been thrown together almost at random. Good stuff,but not Mayall's best."
3,Not all that,This movie was ok not funny nothing out of the norm.I would not recommend it.The story goes not were not climax or anything resolved.Just one night and four stupid guys that have no life who get intosome trouble. And then go home in the morning.
5,Painter ROCKS!!!,"I have been using Painter 6 for a long time. Never wanted to upgrade because there was never anything new that was worth the upgrade for me. Well all that has changed with this new version!!! This version of Painter is definitely the best yet!First thing you will notice is the speed improvements. But as you start using the app, and try out the new features, you will find that there are plenty of new stuff that makes this an incredible upgrade. Digital Watercolor, Quick clone, Artist' oils, customization, brush controls, custom palettes, snap to path to name a few.Thank you Corel, it's about time!!!"
2,Trial version deeply unsatisfactory.,"I am ""using"" the trial version as I write. Wonderful new auto-painting, underpainting effects? Try entering those words, or variants, in the online help. Nothing. They can't even be bothered to put that in. Cynical isn't the word. Slow too, on my powerful Mac. AND - the image changes its magnification - size on the screen - randomly!!! No other program does that on my computer. A bug, perhaps? You get a feeling from software, from Corel's home page, from other sources: I don't like it, and won't buy it."
1,This software is all thumbs,"I found this product to be a major letdown. The disappointment began with the goofy ""finger"" package (which doesn't really convey the product is a painting app), and continued with what is inside the package. I found the performance sluggish, and the program crashed on me numerous times. Also, the interface is not well designed, and I didn't find it intuitive at all. Luckily, I didn't throw down any cash for this product, as I was lucky enough to have a friend who had a copy. We were both disappointed, and are thankful that there are other, better painting products on the market these days."
1,continual crashes,"I'm running Windows XP, service pack 3 and have plenty of room on my computer for Painter IX. The trial version that came with my CorelDRAW X3 worked fine, but now that I've bought and installed the program it continually crashes with certain brushes. Corel support for the program seems non-existent. I evidently bought a useless program. I can't find updates or patches. I've been using CorelDRAW programs professionally ever since Corel 4, both the vector and the painting programs, and had nothing but respect for Corel, but the lack of support for their older programs seems to say the company wants to force you to buy new computers and brand new Corel products."
5,Five Out Of Five,"If you truly want reputable reviews, check out PC Magazine or MacAddict (among others). Both of them gave it top marks and and ""Excellent"" and ""Awesome"" rating. Check with your other favorite publications too."
1,Didn't Work with XP,Frustrating. Couldn't get it to work with Windows XP. Which is only the world's most common DOS.
5,A passion for dancing!,I purchased this video as a gift for my 25 yr old daughter who is a dancer. She is obsessed with Gene Kelly. I believe any Gene Kelly fan would love this video. My daughter gave it rave reviews.
4,Very informative,This is a very informative commentary on Gene's life and career. We have enjoyed watching it though we seldom watch it all the way through at a sitting. It is a bit slow paced compared to a Gene Kelly movie. My daughter did a paper on it for college and got a good grade. That was worth it!
4,Great guitar. Singer? Songwriter? Not so much...,"I haven't heard any of his more recent albums. He is (of course) best known for his instructional books and videos. His touch is deft, funky without being overstated. I am not as high on his songs as such as the other reviewer, but they are good frameworks for his tasty playing and soloing. His singing is adequate.His influences, esp. considering the date of this album are pretty obvious--his excellent slide playing on the first half of this album evokes Ry Cooder. A few cuts at the end (particularly the final cut) are obviously strongly influenced by Mark Knopfler. If you love these guys, you will enjoy this album--I know I did."
4,Guitar picking,"Arlen Roth's guitar playing is wondrous. Half the album contains moody, instrumental pieces, whilst the second half has vocal, quirkier numbers. Not Her Usual Man and Poor Side of Town are worth the cost of the album on their own."
5,Webster's New World Letter Writing Handbook,This is an excellent book to have on hand if you are a frequent letter writer. I've learned valuable information just by skimming through the book. I recommend this book to anyone looking for information on how to correctly write a letter.
4,Would have preferred a novel,"This novella is a nice little story, but common to Erikson's style in that it takes a while to really get going. By the time he's really gotten things to a point where the reader is engrossed, the novella is almost over. Still, an excellent work of fantasy, and a fun diversion whilst waiting for the next Malazan book."
4,Good little break.,"If you enjoy Erikson's main series this little, and I mean little, novel will only wet you appetite for more of Erikson's writing. This book looks short and is deceptively shorter, so paying full price might not be the best idea. If you like Erikson's style without having to juggle multiple storylines, you will definitely enjoy this novel. It lacks action but the town of Lamentable Moll comes to life without it. It basically gives you a back story to Bauchelain and Korbal Broach and their manservant Reese. I found the novel enjoyable even without the action. Overall I found it worth my time."
3,entertaining but not up to standard,while this novela was well written and entertaining it lacked a lot of what the malazan series gives the reader. i assume by intention it was short and basic however a little too much brevity and simplification was taken on behalf of the author. The entre book was roughly equivlant to one chapter in the malazan series but without the interaction between alternate storylines and multiple characters. Overall an entertaining read but i'd finished it in just over an hour and felt slightly cheated. However it was a entertaining hour.
2,Not Erikson's best work.,"Much as I love Erikson's novels, this first novella was a bit of a disappointment. Bauchelain, Korbal Broach and Emancipor Reese were fun characters in Memories of Ice, and it's good to learn a bit more about them. But the story is weak - it might have been good as an element in a full-size novel, but isn't strong enough to stand on it's own.Hopefully Erikson will get things right in the next novella. Not to mention, hurry up with the next novel."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Battleaxe perhaps better than necromancy.When a man, whom we discover later is an old veteran, has something unfortunate happen to a previous employer he has to find a new job.First a few beers though, which is maybe not the best thing beforehand. His new employers turn out to be anything but ordinary, and he soon finds himself mixed up in a serial killing investigation led by the King's best investigator.Starts off in a lighthearted manner, and descends into something nastier, as our protagonist, Reese, is in way over his head.Apparently part of some backstory of his Malazan series, although I am not sure this is good enough to make me want to read 7000 pages of that, as yet."
3,5 star story - 1 star transfer to DVD,"I'll have to agree with the previous reviewers both in appraisal of the story-- it's great, and denigration of the technical quality of this particular DVD version. Just be forwarned to prepare yourself for only fair to poor video quality (grainy & high contrast) and continous distortion in the audio.Having said that I kind of doubt we'll see a better transfer anytime soon of this 1948-49 film. I'm willing to give the DVD's technical weaknesses a pass in order to have this important film in my library."
2,Poor transfer,"This is a film I remember fondly, but was very disappointed with this transfer (from 905 Entertainment); the colours are faded and the soundtrack very coarsened and almost unlistenable - indeed, the very opening of Vaughan Williams' superlative score has been clipped in this version. There's now a far superior transfer available from Optimum Classic as part of their Easling Studios Collection - on sale from amazon.co.uk: vibrant colours and a much better soundtrack, so the extra dollars for that version are worth it!"
3,A gripping Tale,"Well done (in a '40's perspective) film of Scott's last attempt to reach the South Pole. I would've expected more(some,at least)restoration of such an historical film. It really rated 5 starss but 2 were deducted because of the poor print quality.Edward Kerriegolden@shaw.ca"
4,Enjoyable tunes...,"My introduction to Jackie was live, when he opened for The Avett Brothers at The Greek Theater in Berkeley, California. This disc is the favorite of one of my new friends (met at that show) and while it won't make the top tier of my choices, it's peaceful and relaxing. Sounds a good bit like Cory Smith."
5,Jackie Greene,"This kid is amazing, no other way to put it. The reviewer Dane Henas is simply without knowledge to say he is the worst performer. This review just shows how many people are lacking intellegence."
5,Sweet Somewhere Bound,"Love all Jackie Green's songs. But, the case was cracked when I recieved it. Still the CD played fine, so I'm happy."
5,Put the feelin in it Jackie!,"I took my girlfriend to see Jewel and was blown away when Jackie Greene opened for her. Jackie is an incredile musician but what made me an instant fan was the raw emotion he puts into his songs. It was just him his acoustic guitar and his harmonica, with the occasional piano.I must say I was disapointed by this record because it is missing the raw emotion he projects when he plays on stage. Who ever is recording you Jackie tell them to allow you to open up in the studio. It should be noted I have ordered Jackie's other 2 records and I plan on seeing him live twice in July so I'm in no way put off my this record. I'm just dissapointed because I've seen and heard what he'd capabale of.I'm 25 so I dcon't want to hear that only old people like Jackie.Rock on."
4,Flawless renditions of old classics on piano and banjo.,"I originally had this on a record many years ago. While reviewing old albums for disposition (as my record player had died), I came across it and just had to get a copy on CD so that I could listen to it again in the car. These guys were GOOD instrumentalists. Just about all of the selections allow for Snowden and Jackson to show their stuff. If you have any interest in this kind of music, get this one!! You won't be sorry."
2,Poor quality,"This plane in no way compares with one I bought in Amsterdam in 1976. Although we have super glued the handle it works well, but I thought this new one would be nice. The blad is thinner and too flexible. I am not happy with it."
4,Great!,"They're called good grips for a reason: easy to use, nice sharp edge, and the cheese comes easily off the plane!"
5,Works Great!,"I ordered this OXO Good Grips Cheese Plane from Amazon because I needed just a few more bucks in my cart to qualify for free shipping, and the only other cheese cutter I have is the big kind with the wire, that I risk my life with upon every use! I hate that thing!This thing, however, I love. It cuts perfect slices of cheese! Very happy."
2,too bendy!,I loved this the first few times I used it--very thin consistent slices of hard cheese. But then it started bending (in the neck between handle and slicing face). Hard to slice a piece of cheese when it's bending backwards on you. Am going to look for a slicer that has a sturdier looking neck/handle.
1,Faulty design,"I received this for a gift. It worked well for a couple of months, but is not made to last. Because the metal connecting to the handle is flimsy, it flexes and bends slightly with use. After less than 4 months, mine broke cleanly in half. My previous cheese planes lasted for many years, only to be discarded after getting dull.After sending an email to OXO, they replied quickly and offered to replace the item.Pros: thin,sharp, flexible, cuts nicely. Company has very good customer service!Cons: thin metal will most likely break"
2,Was Good At First....and Then...,"This bends- and bends and feels like it will soon just break off. Now because it bends so much, it does not cut well anymore. I would not buy this product again, and I don't recommend it either."
4,"GOOD utensil, but...","Oxo makes an amazing variety of good utensils, and this is one of them. I like it a lot: easy to use, ergonomically sound, doesn't tire my hand out, etc.BUT...those nifty little design features in the handle retain water from the dishwasher like mad. I either drip across the floor to the drawer if I forget, or have to stand the thing in the drainer after I've whacked all the extra water out. It's a minor point, I know, but very annoying.If all you ever do is hand-wash it, you will likely give it 5 stars. I would!"
3,what you'd expect,"With this disc being the combo breaker of the series by being the only one not to have a limited edition. But you do get the DVD at a more reasonable price and the cover is a but sentimental with Konata's mom following the two.For a smaller price you get less, but then again it isn't the limited edition stuff that's the most important, but rather the DVD itself."
3,Ok,It was A pretty good ppv. I would have given it 4 stars if the price of the video was $15-$25 dollars cheaper.
1,I loved this PPV,I would have given it more stars if they had made the price a little lower. But it was a great PPV.
1,A Dud,I found this album to be pretty lame not one sung jumped at me after numerous listens. We all know the overplayed sappy insipid ballad If You Leave Me Now i was tired of it 15 years ago. I have no problem with ballads but when they are made strictly to make money that is when i have a problem with them. The thing with this album is the music is simply not that good no standouts as i say. I realized Terry Kath passed away before the making of Hot Streets but at least that album has four good tunes. Skip this one please
2,"good, but not great.","Watched this movie on TCM. Lot's of stars, but not much in the way of believeability. But, it's apparently true, after being sentenced to death and then having his sentence commuted, Mr. Resko was paroled after only serving 17 years?! As far as the move goes, it appears to be an old TV video. The lighting really sucks. If another director had done the same movie with the same scenes and the same dialogue, but changed the camera angles and lighting, it could have been a great movie."
4,CONVICTS 4 on DVD,"A very pleasant suprise from the Warner Archive Collection. The film is clean with no debris and age releated defects, however, there is one momentary glitch somewhere in the middle portion, but no big problem. Overall, all those who have waited for Convicts 4 to be released in DVD format should be satisfied. Assembly line packaging with no bonus material."
4,Very good.,Enjoyed both series 1 and 2. Another interesting view of the life during WWII.What both women and men did to survie and for their country.
3,No closed captioning,"This might be a great series if you could understand what they're saying, since there's no closed captioning. Series 1 was better than Series 2. Very expensive for so few hours in the series."
1,Awful... pure dreck.,"If you've never heard this album and are a Miles fan.. AVOID THIS ALBUM AT ALL COSTS!! This is nothing like any Miles you would know or ever want to know. It's the cheesiest pile of 80's rap, trumpet twidling and absurdness ever put to CD. I am still a huge Miles fan, but this seriously knocked my respect for him down a notch or two. Beyond awful- it's almost painful to hear."
1,Miles's worst album,"This album, I definetly don't reccomend. There are two or three good songs but the rest stink. A poor follow up of Decoy."
1,Come on man!!!!,"It never ceases to amaze me on how fans of Miles Davis (few) claim to really enjoy this piece of garbage! Truthfully, I don't even know why this album in particular was reissued. The first track ""One Phone Call/Street Scenes"", the crappiest track on the album re-caps from when he was arrested by the police while driving his Ferrari. Sting makes an unnecessary appearance on the track posing as a French cop (gag). ""Time After Time"", and ""Human Nature"" are the only songs worth listening to out of the rest. I'm not so sure what a genius like Miles Davis was thinking when he put this one out, but this was a big let down. It does, however, feature some great musicians i.e. John Scofield, Darryl Jones, etc. If you're interested in 80's Miles, start with Tutu. The songs on Tutu were written by Marcus Miller and way better than this one."
1,Poor quality Miles,"This is one of the very worst albums in Miles' entire 45 year recorded output. It contains uninspired performances by Miles' standards, and some of the least distinctive material. Even a great artist can have a dud now and then, and this is Miles' big dud. When you listen to this album in the context of all of Miles' electric music, it is dull and disappointing."
4,"Still, the Master","Listen to what is likely the final recording of Miles' rasp- ""You Got One Phone Call."" For me, it's a must-have. The voice and the cover shot of Miles, armed and dangerous. Miles' work could not be classified as 'soft' jazz. He was experimenting, right up til the end. That infamous ""in your face"" sauce; heartbreakingly tender, redhot and raging- is there in this- not his best, but remarkable, still CD. There will never be another Miles- and if a few elevators were blessed enough to be filled with his sound- there's a better ride- up or down. The last track speaks to the passage of Miles Davis - ""Then there were none."""
4,Arresting Concept...,"I have no harsh words of criticism for Miles' 1985 pop-soft jazz effort. While so-called die hard fans of Miles or jazz used adjectives such as ""flop"", ""poor quality"", and ""worst"", it is anything but...The only slight unstable choices he made was to do cover instrumentals of Michael Jackson's Human Nature and Cyndi Lauper's Time After Time at a time when the original songs were still fresh. Instead, he should have opted for writing a couple of original tunes himself (even if they were only going to be filler material---the key word being original).These two tracks ended up being played as light elevator music tunes in department or grocery stores. The rest of the album, however, showed that Miles could adapt to the changing times and styles of music in order to reach younger listeners as well. No longer was his music exclusive to hardcore jazz purists...Miles Davis is for the entire world !"
4,There's a trick to this album,"The trick to this album is not to think of it as a Miles Davis album. If you're looking for Kind of Blue, Bitches Brew, or any of the other work that made Miles Davis, well, Miles Davis you aren't going to be happy. Not at all. But if you like that sort of 1980s pop instrumental jazz with slick production and really tight playing then give it a shot. By that standard it's really not a bad album. The first track may not be great, but it's got a hooky groove that's guaranteed to stick in your head."
4,I like to hear this album - better than most sh... today!,"1st the correkt list of tunes: 1. One phone call / Street scenes 2. Human nature 3. MD 1 / Something's on your mind / MD 2 4. Ms. Morrisine 5. Katia prelude 6. Katia 7. Time after time 8. You're under arrest 9. Medley: Jean Pierre You're under arrest Then there were none... I love the music of Miles Davis, so I'm not objective, but the previewer were not, too. It's wonderful music!"
5,Perfect for dusty remodeling project,Fit my Shop Vac brand 16 gallon well and worked great. Held a LOT of junk before needing to be replaced.
4,"Used For Drywall, Could Fit Better","I bought these for a the drywall we've been repairing due to two different leaks in our home. They worked okay for the most part. I also purchased the sander to hook up to the vacuum and I was totally happy with the setup. The vacuum did off and on come off so all the debris was going straight into the vacuum. I checked to make sure it was not user error. It was not, it just could have a little bit tighter fit on the rubber gasket that fits on the intake of the vacuum.I probably would purchase again because of the price, and how quickly it arrived. I didn't notice any dust spewing into the air, which is important with a little one in the home. As with any home repair there will be some dust as seen on the furniture."
5,Freshness and precision of language and thought.,"Most readers of this book will probably be spiritually inclined. I am not, and indeed have a suspicion of most writing described as ""spiritual."" Yet I am moved and fascinated every time I dip into Shafts of Light--a book to dip into rather than to read straight through, modest in its ambitions but at the same time quietly assertive. When I first read around in this book, it gave me comfort following the death of a close friend. Now I can open it and find new treasures each time, suiting different moods. The writing and the thought are invariably fresh and precise. Sometimes the book is funny. Who else has advised: ""Dunk the mind in God""?"
4,Very good reliable watch,"I have had this watch for about six years and it has been very reliable. Although I am pretty rough on it, it still holds up. My only complaint is that the crystal does get scratched up and after a couple of years the watch band does show wear. So far every two years I ship the watch back to Luminox for an overhaul. I have the battery, crystal, and watch band replaced. It runs a little over $100. It is worth it to have a watch that looks like new again. If you are in the market for a Luminox watch, I would get this model versus the cheaper one that has the plastic case. This is the model that I started with. It lasted almost two years until the part of the case that holds the watch band broke. For a little more money, get this watch and it will last maybe forever with the stainless steel case."
3,Meh,"I bought this to use with my shop vac for cleaning out my truck. The long skinny attachment works good, but the wider one doesn't really pick up dirt very well from my floor mats. I've never had a use for the brushy one so I don't know how it works. Since I mainly wanted to use this for cleaning my floor mats without having to rob the house vacuum of it's attatchments, I would say this pretty much failed for the purpose I bought it for."
5,I liked the movie,"If you are not an open minded person this movie is not for you. This movie has very mature content and it's only for adults. I personally liked it because I like sexy movies. It had an interesting twist to it. This movie is basically about love, sensuality, and trust. Even though it is a low budget movie I think the acting was pretty good. I can't wait to buy this movie on DVD. I only have it on VHS."
4,Its a black production! cut it some slack!!!,"Proof Positive is a very decent movie...I would say pretty good at at times and laughably bad at others. You have to keep in mind that this movie was produced by Maverick Entertainment. Basically meaning black cast and low buget. All their movies have models on the cover that look nothing like the acttors in the movie. What can you say? They are marketing ""B"" movies that are often going to be overlooked by the masses. Put down your glass of hate-er-rade and enjoy a pretty funny movie. Its not great, but it does what it does well. Plus, you can't judge a book by its cover."
1,ARE YOU SERIOUS?,"This is the WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!!My best friend and i decided to view this movie for free on Netflix....we read the description and it sounded awesome (descriptions can be deceiving!!) Okay...the three people on the cover arent in the movie, its so low budget you can hardly understand it, the two lesbians end up with guys....its just awful unbelievable unbearable just terrible!!DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY...get a bootleg or something!!"
5,Easy,"Item was as described and shipped promptly. We have had some trouble finding these locally, finding them on Amazon was a pleasant surprise. This is why I love Amazon, it's easy, correct and shipped right to me, on time, fairly priced. What more could you want."
2,Very basic,"I didn't find much useful information in this book. It explained the obvious (don't weld in a hayloft - it might catch fire, etc.) but offered little meat on techniques.The author was apparently quite taken with a young lady welder - she appears frequently in the photos!"
5,an awesome talent,that john lennon was. I play a lot of his cds when I have time. such a magical talent. sigh.
3,Great Lennon songs...a worthy release,"There are some great Lennon compositions on this release. I think the editorial review was a little over harsh. Given Lennon's worth as a songwriter and the fact that he died so prematurely I think that there's plenty of merit in the act of releasing and enjoying these songs. Yoko's cuts have less broad appeal and will probably not be your cup of tea, unless you're a fan of contemporary Japanese ""noise music"" (Melt Banana, Merzbow, Boredoms) and/or early 80s dance music. However it's worth mentioning that she's cited as an important influence on some specialized contemporary genres AND Lennon himself was very supportive of her efforts (how clever of the reviewer below to make fun of Yoko Ono's name...gee, I wonder why someone named ""Eugene Dobson"" would need to stoop that low?). Keep that in mind and then go ahead and enjoy this release!"
3,Good...but not great.,"It's not that I hate Yoko; I don't. It's just that I don't care for the style of music she releases. That includes her songs on ""Milk and Honey"". On the other hand, John's tracks are very well done. I personally prefer listening to disc four of the LENNON box set which includes all of John's songs from both ""Double Fantasy"" and ""Milk and Honey"". It is a more satisfying listen."
3,Watered Down Double Fantasy,"Like DF, M&H is part Lennon, part Ono. Unlike it's predecessor, M&H lacks the polished, lush production, and indeed contains unfinished takes (Lennon's) and two mono tape demoes (Grow Old With Me, Let Me Count The Ways). This updated version does include bonus tracks, including interviews.Highlights include -I'm Stepping OutI Don't Wanna Face ItNobody Told MeBorrowed TimeMy Little Flower Princess (Forgive Me)Grow Old with MeEvery Man Has a Woman Who Loves HimStepping Out (Home Version)Interview with J&Y December 8th, 1980Interview With J & Y December 8th, 1980And the low points (courtesy of Ms. Ono) are -Sleepless NightDon't Be ScaredO'SanityYour HandsLet Me Count the WaysYou're the OneThe latter six are highly recommended for masochists and insomniacs."
2,Andrew Mueller Nailed It,"The Amazon review by Andrew Mueller perfectly expresses my take of this album. Part of Lennon's narcissism - shared with McCartney in earlier Linda days - is the assumption that we'll love what he loves. Indeed, how many people actually listen to this album or Double Fantasy with equal attention to both artists? Unfortunately, John Lennon's creative life after the Beatles was long on promise but very short on delivery. Not one of these songs has the grace, cleverness, craft or exuberance of 1963's It Won't Be Long, let alone Strawberry Fields. Many Beatle fans seem to be as indulgent with Lennon's later mediocrity as he was."
2,"I Don't Want To Face It, no no no no","Have I ever listened to this all the way through? I suppose I have, once or twice. ""Nobody Told Me"" knocked me out when I first heard it. But the final creative outpouring of the Lennons (""diarhea of creativity"", John called it in his final interview) doesn't hold much attraction for me anymore--and not because of Yoko, either (not in particular, anyway). It's too much personal myth-making, too self-centered. I hope to someday understand this period of their lives better than I do now. Meantime, anyone want to buy my copy of the record? Near-mint condition!"
5,Lennon's swan song delightfully delivers!,"These songs, the remainder from 1980's ""Double Fantasy"" sessions deliver a sharp and delightful musical punch. While they aren't as ""slick"" as ""Double Fanatasy"" (John had planned to double track his vocals after Christmas, 1980), tracks such as ""Nobody Told Me"" , ""I Don't Want to Face It"" and ""Steppin Out"" are John at his rock and roll best. Songs such as the reggae-influenced ""Borrowed Time"" and the tropical island-drenched ""Forgive Me"" are wonderful and offer a glmpse of the great music that was to come..... In addition, Yoko's ""You're The One"" is a classic ""Walking On Thin Ice"" esqe recording---and this remastered edition features John's ""lead"" vocal on Yoko's ""Every Man Has a Woman"" (as a bonus track). I highly recommend this CD."
4,family classic,I rented this as a Christmas eve movie and wasn't sure if it would be as good as I remembered it from my childhood ascend it definitely was entertaining
2,"Although rated PG, not a kid friendly movie.",It has been years since watching this movie so I didn't remember a lot about it except that it was funny. I felt that there was way too much violence and swearing in the movie and would cringe each time since my kids were watching it!
5,Christmas Classic,"Just love this movie, it is a Christmas staple like Ginger Bread Houses and Christmas Trees. However only Home Alone 1 and 2 are the REAL Home Alones. All the others are just imitation."
5,I love it,This is one of my top favorites. At the cheap price I had to add to my collection for viewing over and over!
5,Classic,This is such a great classic. It still makes me laugh. I still like to watch it every year at Christmas.
5,Classic!!,I have loved this movie ever since it came out in 1990. I don't know why it took me so long to purchase it.
4,Old School Funny,"Rented this movie to watch with my two boys. They both thought it was very funny and liked to see the ""kid"" win."
2,Poor Quality,"It is unfortunate that a good film was in poor quality. The top and bottom of the movie was chopped off. The only reason I did not send this back was my grandson wanted it so bad. I will be ordering another copy for Walmart, FYE or Toys R Us"
1,I was cheated,"Yes, I feel cheated. Nowadays, when you buy a dvd labelled ""widescreen"" you should be getting anamorphic widescreen, not a letterboxed 4:3 image. Anything less than anamorphic and yet still labelled ""widescreen"" is a ripoff. That includes this DVD.To add insult to injury, the picture quality of this version is exceptionally poor and has the appearance of having been dubbed directly from an old VHS tape.I am referring to the Twentieth Century Fox 1999 DVD release in these comments."
2,Leave this alone,"I never bought into the Culkin hype. Here, he is cute, but not a good actor. His line readings are flat, and I sometimes had a hard time understanding what he was saying. The movie's much ballyhooed violence is indeed extreme. The Three Stooges did the same kind of thing with finesse, just funny slapstick that did not leave a mark and you knew was done in jest. Here, Pesci and Stern go through so much I felt myself getting numbed to the consequences. This is just Hollywood fodder wrapped up for the masses; the kind of movie you can turn your brain off and the VCR on. The best scenes here were the ones involving O'Hara and Candy; Rest In Peace, John."
1,Bummer!,"Don't buy this thinking you are getting a Director's Cut. You get the movie with rambling talking over the whole movie. Normally when you buy something like this, it includes one disc with the actual movie and another disc with the director's cut as well as out takes, etc. If you want the movie - don't buy this! SUCH A BUMMER!"
2,disc scratched,I could tell as soon as I picked this dvd up that something was broken inside. When I opened it I found that the little piece that holds the dvd in place was broken and the dvd was just sliding all around in the case. The dvd is scratched up pretty bad but I have not tried playing it yet. Anyone else that handled that dvd would have heard that something was moving around inside the case and that is not a good sign.
2,Ignore me,"If that kid screamed one more time, I really might have had to hurt him. I truly didn't like this movie - but it's just me. I don't care for The Three Stooges, either, and this was just like one of their skits: gag after gag after gag. But that's not all that bugged me. I like Robin Williams and his gags, but there's a message behind his films. A point. A moral. Home Alone was just plain stupid. Kids, yeah, kids would like it, but I can't imagine a thinking, intelligent adult deigning to spend an evening watching this hogwash."
5,great film,this film has been very influential and probably Macaulay Culkin's best film.the film is very funny.Joe Pesci is very funny.i liked it back in 90 and still enjoy it.the other two are very lame.
5,Forgot how much I love this movie,Grew up watching this movie (when all my parents' friends wouldn't let them watch it because it was too violent)... I forgot 1) how much of a brat Kevin actually is in the beginning and 2) how sweet it actually is near the end. Kind of a Christmas classic.
5,A classic,"What can I say but...Terrific! This is a Holiday classic, and a must see every Christmas for our entire family. I highly recommend."
4,slap-stick gallour !!,"oh yes ! its unbelievable stuff . no kid kood or wood , but still , a brought to life fantasy type story iis more fun than , well , ice on sidewalks .... woohoo !!"
4,just what i wanted,my grand children love it. I think their mom and dad do too. I need seven more words to get on with my day Thanks
5,"Fabulous, greatest of all time",Home alone is without a doubt the greatest movie ever. I have watched it at least 30 times. If you saw it when you were a youngster then you will surely like it still today.
4,quick and easy,My husband's favorite holiday movies are the first 2 Home Alone movies. I was having a hard time finding them in stores and a friend suggested getting them online. It was only a few weeks until we were to fly home for the holidays and I was concerned that the movies would not be shipped to our home in time. My friend assured me that Amazon was always had quick delivery and ordering online would be super simple. She was right! This selller had the movie I ordered at my home with plenty of time to spare. I will be checking online for good deals before hitting the stores from now on. Thanks! :)
4,Great Start to a Wonderful Series,"Home Alone is a great film. When Kevin is left behind as his family rushes to leave on their vacation, he becomes the man of the house. And when two burglers come around, he has to make sure they don't get him. The answer: an array of booby traps ready to take them down. This is a wonderfully entertaining film, and a great start to what would become an even better series of three great movies (I'm discounting the fourth one). In the next two movies, the plot becomes more evolved, the booby traps become more dangerous, and therefore more fun to watch, and the crooks become smarter. This good film is followed up by two more great films, so buy all three, and have yourself a good laugh."
1,Was sent as a gift - didn't hear from them,Sent as a gift. Althought I thought I had type in a message to go with it they didn't even know who sent it!!! Thanks
4,Fun kinda clean family movie!,"I give this movie a watch every Xmas holiday. It reminds me of how cell phones and text messages and laptops etc..were not parts of movies or a required thing to have back then. Ahhhhhh I'm that old person now! Nooooooooooooo! My son is 8 and watched this year with me and said ""why ont she just use her cell phone"" why don't he just se the laptop? What no FaceTime? Lol. Great movie. Great cast. Fun time! Ramble ramble"
5,Grandkids,Always have loved this movie. My grandchildren watch it quite often. It doesn't have to be Christmas to enjoy this movie. There's a good story line to explain to the kids. So glad I got the Bluray edition.
2,"excellent film, poor DVD","I purchased what was labeled a Widescreen (16x9 aspect ratio )DVD of Home Alone.What I received was a 4x3 version with the top and bottom of the frame chopped off.I was able to verify this with my 4x3 VHS tape version of Home Alone. The transfer to DVD was so poor it had barely a sharper picture than my VHS.It's a shame such a fine film should be butchered for what is otherwise a decent medium.It's bad enough that the left and right side of the frame is chopped off for the 4x3 version and most widescreen versions with an aspect ratio of 1.85:1, but to further cut off the top and bottom is a disgrace."
2,Beware-very poor picture quality on DVD,"This is a great movie. We always watch it around the holidays. However, the picture quality on this DVD is terrible. I think the VHS version is better. They should really go back and redo the digital version."
4,Still One of the Funniest Christmas Movies Around,"Home Alone is truly an entertaining Christmas movie to watch during the holiday season. Macaulay Culkin plays the character of the mischievous Kevin McAllister so well in that he brings life to the movie and is just downright funny when he complains about his family.Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are also quite comical as the ""wet bandits"" and bring a great sense of goofiness to the film.Overall, this movie is still funny to this day and it never gets old. Some of the traps that Kevin sets up are lethal (i.e. iron falling from laundry-shoot scene) and certainly unrealistic, but then again, this is Hollywood.The DVD is clear and the widescreen aspect ratio is closer to full screen, which I like personally. There aren't any special features, but who cares? The movie makes up for it.Bottom Line: Buy the DVD if you like this movie"
5,Classic Comedy,This movie has always been a childhood favorite and I encourage everyone to buy Home Alone because the language is very mild and it's suitable for a family audience.
5,This Family favorite!,"We had a family tradition of watching this Thanksgiving evening, but it as not aired this year. The family received the DVD for Christmas, and loved watching it again! It is a classic."
4,The same as all the others,Home Alone is a very good movie but the other two did not need to be done. It is basically the same but different people.
5,Great movie,This is one of my favorite movies and Macaulay Culkin is one of my favorite actors. I highly recommend this movie to everyone that hasn't seen it.
3,Not as funny as I remembered it,"I forgot how nasty the family is to each other at the beginning of this movie. It was really offputting. Especially when watching it with my little one. Plus, the use of a bb rifle is hard to watch in today's climate. However, the actual showdown with the thieves is still hilarious. It only lasts for about 20 minutes. The rest is missable."
1,BRAND NEW BLU RAY SKIPS,"Well, most everyone already knows this adorable family friendly movie. It's wonderful, which is why I bought it! However I bought this for our family to enjoy together and the blu-ray skips in the same spot everytime. It freezes on the screen and you miss 4 minutes of the good action where the robbers are trying to get in the house. Very disapointing, I'm going to see how much it costs to ship it back. Unfortuantely for $10 it's probably not worth the hassle or shipping costs."
5,still a fun movie to watch after all these years,i cannot believe it has been almost 19 years since this movie came out. i remember when it first came out and seeing it in theaters. hard to believe i was only 5 years old at the time. still enjoy watching it after all these years. it is a wonderful heartwarming family comedy. i am so happy to have it in my collection and everybody else should have it in there's too.
4,Home Alone,Esta película es un clasico. Mis hijos de 6 y 7 años no se cansan de verla.ClaudiaCaracas-Venezuela
3,comedy action,"The burglars were funny and goofy. But, they were a bit too crazy. Why? Because when they tripped on ice, and stepped on christmas ornaments is was too violent. That's why I only gave it three stars.But I just didn't think it was so great. So, that's why I'm not getting home alone 2."
3,Its a fun christmas family film but is not great,Home Alone is one of the top grosing films ever and is a family classic but it's not a great film. Yes the film is funny and it's a fun family film for the whole family but it's not a great film. Maybe I dont find it great becouse I've seen it so maney times and i dont find the traps funny anymore(I liekd the traps in the sequal better). The story is un beievale as a boy is left home alone by mistake during christmas and he sets the house full of traps to catch 2 bumbling robbers. Culkien is great and Stern and Pesi are funny. The movie is a good christmas film.
5,love this movie,"I grew up watching this movie every Christmas. It became a family tradition. Now that I have a daughter, I hope to start the same tradition with her. This is a great family film; perfect to watch around the holidays."
4,AHHHHHHH!,"Home Alone is one of the best children's comedys of all time. But it's not just for kids, grown ups can enjoy it too. It stars Macauly Culkin (Uncle Buck), and Joe Pesci. It's really a good movie. It doesn't come on TV alot so if you won't to record it you'll have to wait until around Christmas. But I think it's a buy."
5,movie,Very nice movie and it was broadcasted without a glitch! Very nice movie and it was broadcasted without a glitch!
3,A classic!,"It is good to see this brought over to Blu. It gets a much needed upgrade in the visuals and sound. Although it is not a dramatic improvement, you will be happy none the less."
4,Christmas classic,"So fun to revisit this one. Kevin(Culkin) is clearly in need of some discipline, and why didn't be simply dial 911, if he's so smart rather than boobytrap his house? Eh, just sit back and enjoy the nostalgia."
4,Such a Great Time with the Kids at Christmas!,"We enjoyed this as a family around Christmas. To be so old, it really doesn't come across as too dated. Amazon's streaming HD was beautiful."
4,great christmas movie!!,I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a funny christmas story!! it really got me in the christmas spirit
4,It's a classic,I'm not sure why I have to write a review on this. This movie came out about 20 years ago and is a classic. If you haven't seen it yet there's nothing I can say that'll convince you to watch it. The HD is a nice effect and definitely makes it more theatrical.
5,Christmas or anytime movies,This has got to be one of the best holiday (or anytime) movies. It's for people of all ages and keeps you laughung until the end.
5,Home Alone--fabulous,"Home Alone is a classic story to be enjoyed by all ages. It is both slapstick and touching, to be watched each Christmas to make us belly laugh and to all be grateful for our families."
5,Awesome movie,I forget how much they cut out when the movie is played on cable. its a classic Christmas movie for sure
5,Love this movie,You can definitely see the digitally remastered edition better in blu-ray! plus it's just an overall great movie classic! :)
4,Entertaining for whole family,"My kids (ages 8 & 10) really enjoyed it. I would have preferred, however, that the few incidents of not so nice language have been left out. Overall, really fun movie. Later, we also used it to mention safety from strangers that may intend harm (not overly so, just in conversation)."
4,It's become a Christmas Classic,1 or 2 I can't decide which one is better. I guess we'll have to watch themagain next year.
2,VHS tape was in very bad shape,"Even though my daughter and I do enjoy watching Home Alone the VHS tape was in bad shape, It made a grinding sound when played and broke my VHS player. I was refunded for the movie and the movie was thrown in the trash. It was disappointing because I had to buy a brand new VHS/DVD player which costed me $150 dollars and also because I really wanted my daughter to own that movie, I guess next time I don't buy any more vhs tapes off of amazon."
3,More swearing in it than I remembered.,"Its a cute movie and the kids like it, but it has a lot of swearing for a kid's movie. While we watch the booby trap scenes we usually point out, ""He should be in the hospital now. Ok, he should be dead now. etc."""
3,Home Alone Download,"Great movie for the holidays, downloaded it and I'm satisfied. I would have liked it better in HD so I can watch it on a big screen without distortion."
5,Love it!,Christmas classic! This movie is a must see during the holiday season- you will be laughing non stop. Definitely my favorite Christmas movie ever!
4,Home Alone,Seen many times and still enjoy. My kids love to watch this numerous times around the holidays. A true classic.
4,Christmas tradition,"Enjoyed seeing this classic. Watched it with my grand daughter and she loved it, too. Still is funny after many viewings."
5,You might not think of this as an Xmas film...but it is!,"Yes, the violence is a bit extreme, kind of like RoadRunner & Coyote brought to life, yet somehow Pesci & Stern make it OK to laugh at their foibles. Masterfully crafted by the great John Hughes, this film still stands as the number one all-time box office comedy. But, what really makes this film is the Score. Another triumph for John Williams. I highly recommend adding this film and the soundtrack to your Xmas collection."
3,..,"Ive ordered products from this seller before and theyve been amazing, but halfway into this movie the first time we watched it, it skips and completely freezes, so we have to skip ahead an entire scene. It does that every time we watch it."
5,A modern Christmas classic,This is one of those movies I can watch over and over. That's what makes it a classic.
3,kid awlays love it,home aloneis porably one of the ulimtmate familymovies.I frist saw it when i was 12. i then proccedto see two moretimesin the theatres. then i got the video. now iam 22 and stil llike it.culkin gives a good perfomance proboly because he flimed it before he hit it big.i thiunk he did not want tobe a big star and thats why some of his later perfomance were not as good anyway this is cute and good movie.
3,"Great product, high price",Product was great and in good condition. The price was a bit high though for a used DVD.
5,Classic,This movie is classic. Really funny and filled with action and funny scenes. The actors did an amazing job. The plot of the story is really funny. Did movie is good for any day of the year.
3,this movie always puts me in the holiday mood,"Even though there are so many Christmas-oriented movies, this one and its sequal have always put me in the Christmas spirit... I used to love it more when I was younger, though. Now a days I'd say that the whole beating people up for fun isn't so entertaining."
5,A film with an atmosphere that no one will forget.,Everyone who I've ever spoken to seems to thing this film is lame and not worth watching. but i'm glad I became a reviewer for this purpose and to say my piece. First this film has a strong storyline no matter what anyone says. It has the atmosphere that I would love to have at christmas. And is probaly the reason I watch it over and over again. This dvd edition doesn't have any extra features apart from the trailers which is disappointing as I would of thought for such a sucessful film to at leased have something left on the cutting room floor for us to see. This film in my opinion is a great film that deservers more respect than it's recieving. It's worth the money for such a great film.
3,Beware: Poor quality transfer from video,"""Home Alone"" is one of our favorite Christmas movies, so this year, after owning it on tape, we got the DVD. I wanted to see it in widescreen and with digital quality picture and sound. We popped it in the player and immediately noticed that the picture quality was no better than tape. In fact, many of the flaws from the tape are accentuated on the DVD. The widescreen is nice and the sound is better, but it doesn't make up for the fact that this was a pretty shoddy job of transferring a classic to DVD. How very sad."
5,Movie Classic,Ranks up there with Christmas Vacation and Groundhog Day. A great movie for the whole family that I love to watch.

1,Not in HD,I ordered this in HD and paid the extra for it but it was not in HD the picture quality was as bad as a cheap DVD or a pretty good VHS.
5,Great Christmas movie!!,"Just watched The Blu-Ray edition of Home Alone. And thought it was wonderful. At first I was not going to get Home Alone on Blu-Ray as I already had it on DVD.But when I scene that Amazon was selling it for $14.99 I caved and order it. Thought the 1080p picture was pretty good.I thought The DTS-HD audio was great. John Williams soundtrack sounded awsome in Lossless.Plus the Christmas music thats heard in the movie sounded great too. Realy cool Blu-Ray. And now I see Home Alone 2 will be making it to Blu-Ray this fall along with Miracle on 34th Street orginal version,and the remake. And the 1951 version of A Christmas Carol is making the leap to Blu-Ray this fall too. And I think Paramount is planing on bringing Its A Wonderfull Life to Blu-Ray this Christmas as well?Nice! I love Christmas movies!"
5,Classic!!!,What a classic movie!!! I can watch this movie over and over again like it was my first time walking it!!!
4,If you haven't seen this movie you know nothing about Christmas.,BEST HOLIDAY MOVIE EVER. WORTH OWNING. DO IT. DO IT. DO IT. YOU WON'T REGRET IT! I PROMISE YOU THIS!
1,OOOPS!,"The language was too ""coarse"" for my 5year old grandson. His parents turned it off after the first exchange of ""bad talk""."
5,funh,The original movies with Culkin were fun for the whole family. Shows how important family is. Good for all members of a family.
3,Another fake presentation of an all american family.,"Keep in mind people, what is real and what isn't when you watch movies, please. For pure entertainment this is great, but it is not a reality show! Loved the hark knocks the crooks got. Were it always so!"
2,more of the same,"If you liked the stuff Rhett did several years back (what happened to you Rhett??) then you will like this cd. In fact, most of these songs sound like they came out of the sessions for his first studio record. From what I heard, Rhett was playing Garth Brooks covers at a county fair in Gerogia and fell off the stage, smacking his head not once but twice. He was unable to sing or even drive his dodge ram, so they dug some old stuff out of the studio and released it as new. good luck"
2,All Ads!,"This magazine is about 95% ads for dresses and rings that no one can afford unless they are marrying a celebrity. If an ad only lists a phone number along with a boutique in France you know it's too much money... most of the ads feature girls that look to be no older than 16- too young to be wearing a wedding dress! This magazine only has a handful of articles... I subscribed to it thinking that there would be a lot of DIY wedding ideas and in the entire magazine (400 pages)there was only one. Out of 400 pages, there was only 20 articles, and most of them are advertising for something. This magazine had a lot of good reviews, but I realize now that most of them are from early 2000s, or from people that like the magazine for the photography."
3,Wedding magazines,"These wedding magazines are a create source of info and creativity to those that are not on a budget when doing their wedding. I did loved the entired magazine outline, but I knew that since none in my family is a DYI crafter and we were on a limitted budget, getting them done was not really going to happen for us."
5,TWO LITTLE JEWELS,I BOUGHT THESE LITTLE JEWELS FOR MY REAR SURROUND SPEAKERS AND I AM SURE GLAD I DID. SUPER CLEAR AND JUST RIGHT FOR THE JOB. THANKS JBL
3,It works.,"The concept of the item is great, but the product itself is flawed. The lower portion of the license plate frame is ""tall"" and overlaps the RAISED letters on my license plate. If you take a closer look, you'll also notice that there are no mounting holes on the bottom of the license plate frame. Yet, there are two tabs on the back that are meant to hold the license plate in place. When you insert your license plate into the frame using the tabs, the raised letters of the license plate somewhat interfere with the lower portion of the license plate frame and you have to shimmy your license plate to be centered with the upper mounting holes. The product otherwise serves its purpose, but it could use some improvement."
4,A Good Race,"The Big Race is about four big cars that make fun of a little red car. All of the big cars want to win the race and win the shiny trophy but the big cars lose and little red wins the race and the shiny trophy. If you want to read about never giving up, read this story...Elijah S."
5,"Cute book, great for new readers","This is such a cute book, both for toddlers but also for new readers. It rhymes thoughout the book and basically, is the story of the tortoise and the hare but with racecars. It's really, really cute, rhymes well, and makes learning to read quite the fun time. Highly recommend!"
5,I Finally Read It and Loved It,"A thoroughly fantastic read. As a bit of a history buff, I was somewhat surprised at how radical this book must have seemed when first published. I could not put it down. Delving into an often forgotten aspect of that embarrasing chapter of American history, Ms. Stowe forcefully reminds the reador of the horrors associated with the break up of families under the institution of slavery. The courage and faith exhibited by Uncle Tom is diametrically opposed to the action oriented Charles. Who's approach was more persuasive in the long run is something to debate even today, but being called an 'uncle tom' now means something different to me than before I read this classic tale."
4,Uncle Tom'sCabin,An excellent view of the slave trade and its social impact.I imagine it would have been a driving force for the abolition of this abominable trade.
5,Great book,Love the service it was fast and arrived earlier than what I expected. Satisfaction guaranteed. I think it was a great deal!!
4,Important American Novel,Anyone interested in American history needs to read this novel about slavery in the United States prior to the Civil War. It provides great insight to both the lives of slaves and the impact of slavery on the slaveowners.
4,Good Read,"This book is interesting in that it does not tell what often happens, but of what could happen. And the fact that it could happen is just as bad as if it often did."
3,uncle tom's cabin,This is a classic book. It is very well written but because of the language used it is at times very hard to read.
4,Not as hard as you might think.,"Even thought Uncle Tom's Cabin is over 600 pages long, and it was published 150 years ago, the book is not the hard work that many would assume it to be. The story telling is simple and easy to follow, and the characters are realistic.It took over 100 pages before I started to find the characters compelling, but once I did I breezed through the book. Also, the message against slavery is a tad heavy-handed, but I suppose it would have to be when the target audience is people who are ok with slavery or slave owners themselves.The book was an altogether enjoyable read, but not an entirely necessary one for someone trying to build their knowledge on the canon."
4,Historic Classic- RC,"Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe is a mysterious, enchanting novel. As the main theme and purpose to the novel, it demonstrates the hardships of being a slave. In the book we follow the trading of slave Uncle Tom and his whereabouts. Tom goes through the hardest part of being a slave of beatings, and verbal abusement. I went into this book not knowing what to expect and I found cruel, interesting, loving, and delicate characters and evil and happy relationships. It took me about 7 weeks to complete the novel because of its challenging material. I definitely recommend this book to anyone and everyone who is interested in slave trade and the great guilt that follows it."
2,"Profitable for historical relevance, but long and indirect","I do respect and embrace the historical significance and effect of this novel in it's place and time. I applaud the author's goal, courage and tenacity. I loved the main character, Tom.That said, the writing style is not for me. I'm too spoiled by modern authors' constraints of being direct and succinct.I understand that in the culture of the time, a female author would find it necessary to obviate, to beat around the bush in making her (socially activist) point in order to comply with expectations of politeness and humility, to include occasional flattery of the opposition to make the novel more palatable to a wider audience and thus further her underlying goal. Unfortunately, these elements also make it very hard for ""modern-me"" to endure the book.All-in-all, a profitable read for the historical relevance."
3,History is not quite as tidy,"Considering that Uncle Tom's Cabin was at one point banned (of course in Southern states) I was expected a gritty, horrifying glimpse into the lives of plantation slaves. Not so. Uncle Tom is the honest hard-working slaves of two kind 'owners', Mr. Shelby and Mr St.Clare. It is not until Tom is sold to Mr Legree that his life is filled with cruelty and ultimately death. The majority of the book, I feel, is an observation of how Christianity is a proponent or opponent of slavery depending on who is doing the interpretation. Although, Stowe's admits dramatizing (fictionalizing)the story lines off of 'real' events, I find it hard to believe the ""happy ending"". PBS had a great show called ""Slavery and the Making of America"", their website also gives a list on NON-fiction books on slavery. The truth is far more compelling than fiction."
4,Uncle Tom's Cabin,"The reason why Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote Uncle Tom's Cabin was to let the North know what was going on in the South with slavery . Black families were broken apart and sold, young girls and women were taken advantage of by white owners, some were beaten to death by their owners and slaves could be treated anyway the owner wanted because they were not citizens. The white women characters cared more about the slaves than the white men. They didn't want to sell or break up families.Uncle Tom was an uncommonly good and honest man and devouted Christian. He was sold when his owner needed money. At first he was sold to a man who was ok, but then he was sold to Simon Legree. Legree was a mean man. When Tom was a slave for Legree he was beaten to the point of death. Everyone should read this book because it gives you an idea of what happened at the time of slavery."
4,Uncle Tom's Cabin,"Uncle Tom's Cabin is definitely a great classic. I enjoyed the story plot of this book. I especially loved the chapters on Eliza and her boy and how they ran away from their master. I actually thought this book might be boring but it was very interesting and shows one what slavery was really like and what happened in those days. The story plot is that Eliza and her boy, Harry, are running from their master and the trader because their master sold Harry to the trader. Eliza is just trying to save Harry from the trader taking him away from her. Eliza's husband, a slave for another master, is also running away from his master. I am now excited about other history classics that I am going to read in my history classes now because of Uncle Tom's Cabin."
3,Terribly Predictable,"Harriet Beecher Stowe had the wonderful luck of writing this book when she did- at the peak of American antebellum dissent. The book was obviously intended to reach a very wide audience as it is very easy to read. I give the book a low rating because the reader can predict every next step in the book, and at times it seems that Mrs. Stowe was trying too hard to evoke emotion from the reader-audience. The plot is quite simply too far fetched (with many fantastical reunions and unreal characters). The characters are portrayed as either positively saintly (Uncle Tom), or absolutely demonic (Mr. Legree), with no median. Good story for a soap opera. Bad for a classic historical novel."
4,Great theme and story,"Really enjoying what I have read so far. The dilemma set up is intriguing and I bet at the time was groundbreaking. The writing style is not particularly impressive, but I also have to say I'm no expert in that department. I've enjoyed books that most critics have said are 'poorly written' and not liked books who had the opposite reputation."
5,Uncle Tom's Cabin,"I felt as if I were living during that era. Ms. Stowe helped me understand the actions of the master, by looking into each slave master's background. The masters financial situation determined the life of the slave.I would recommend this book to every African American over 12. We have such a negative image of the uncle Tom character."
5,EXCELLENT!!!,"This is a great audio version of the book. My daughter was to read this book for her history class and with the written (grammer) style of the book it was a difficult to get through, though a VERY GOOD BOOK. I bought this version to help her and EVERYONE in the family stopped what they were doing to listen along!This audio book is VERY well done and I would recommend it to anyone!! We have listend to it several times!! Great for long drives too!!"
5,Amazing and Inspiring,"This is one amazing book that is so profound and utterly astonishing it will knock your socks off. It details the life and adventures of a slave, Uncle Tom, who is sold to a ruthless and heartless master. Despite the brutal whippings and threats Tom sticks up for his faith and remains honest and faithful to the end. This book is riveting and despite popular belief, I found that it was very easy to read. It gives an in depth view to cruel and inhumane institution of slavery. It is quite obvious why Abraham Lincon called it the book that started the war. Without this book no collection is complete and one that I am very glad that I read."
2,"Correct Book, Wrong edition",The book was okay. I was just disappointed that I received a different addition that the one the is in the picture description of the book. I needed the other edition for class but my teacher worked with me. I just wish they said which edition they were selling.
3,Good book till the middle...,"I understand why this book is among the classics- it is extremely eye-opening. It avidly, and realistically, shows a side of slavery's emotional effects.However, the book went downhill in the middle. In the beginning was great; good story lines that were well told. Then the middle came. The book became religious blah blah blah that had nothing to do with pushing the storyline forward. The end is horrible. It's like HBS got tired of writing one day, so she wrote ""And everyone lived happily ever after. Except him- he dies.""This book is a classic for a reason, and I do recommend it for that reason."
2,SOMETIMES INTERESTING BUT TOO LONG!,"I had to read this book for school. It is sooooooooooooooooooo long, I thought we would never get through it ! It also is hard to understand. But it had a good plot."
2,Uncle Tom's Cabin,I finally gave up on Uncle Tom's Cabin. Dialogue written in vernacular drove me nuts.
4,Very Good,This is a book I had never read before but had heard about. It was an eye opener for me. Sad ending though.
5,Uncle Tom's Cabin,"This novel is hard to read but well worth the effort. If you like a good book, do not listen to all the negative reviews. Get the book and put forth the effort to read it. You will not be sorry."
3,A classic mainly because of its social impact,"I think this book deserves the status of a classic due to the issues it addresses and the impact it has had on society. However, from a literary standpoint, the novel is merely average. Stowe is to be admired for her boldness and willingness to write a novel that deals so honestly with the evils of slavery. My critique here is that Stowe's mechanics and style are weak and make for clumsy reading. This book is one that I recommend, but don't expect a masterpiece in terms of literary prowess--do expect a moving depiction of the reprehensible abuse and mistreatment of slaves that will stay with you."
2,Kindle Download,I don't like this book at all it's very boring and there's not much entertainment in the book to keep me wanting to read it more.
2,Meh,"Had to read it for a class called American Women Writers. There is a lot of sentimentality in this book, which was effective for Stowe's anti-slavery agenda of the time. However, as an English major, I don't particularly enjoy sentimentality...I do think this is an important book that needs to be read, but that doesn't mean I enjoyed it."
4,Don't skip the introduction.,"Obviously, the text will be the same regardless of which publication you buy. What I found to be of great value here was the introduction."
4,Should be required reading for everyone born and raised in the United States!,"I realize it is very easy to paint with a broad brush, but there is plenty of guilt to go around. From Southerners who justified their attitudes by appealing to the Bible, to Northerners who were opposed to slavery while keeping freed slaves at arm's length, to everyone who claimed to hate slavery but refused to do anything about it. This book has made me stop and think about the ways I might bend Scripture to fit my preferences and how my sins of omission are just a grievous as my sins of commission. This book moved me to tears at times and gave me a greater appreciation for the gospel. And like other reviewers, it left me scratching my head over why the term ""Uncle Tom"" has come to mean what it does in our culture. For me, Tom was a beautiful illustration of the Sermon on the Mount. I wish I would have read this book years ago."
1,Not Faithfully Reproduced,"This Kindle edition is not accurately reproduced. Don't waste money on it. In my edition at Loc 2416 appears ""I don't know either about religion's being up in the market,"". It then continues with something completely out of context and including the character Ophelia St. Clare. The correct continuation appears at Loc 2447, so that the rendering should have been, ""I don't know either about religion's being up in the market,just now. I have not looked in the papers."" Between Loc 2416 and 2447 is a different part of the book.This kind of error is shameful. Amazon should refund the money paid for the book to every Kindle purchaser of it."
2,Print too small to read,The subject of this book is excellent.The format of this particular book (signet classics) is horrible. The print is SO SMALL that even with 2.0 reading glasses I had difficulty reading it and I have good vision.I cannot recomment this format to anyone..the print is just too small....too bad for such a great book.
2,Ugh. Just ugh.,"Well, reading it all in one weekend may not have been the brightest move of my life. Still, this book was a hideous experience. Once you get past the first hundred and fifty pages the plot picks up enough to give the sheer boredom a minor respite, but the characters are about as flat as anything imaginable. Little Eva in particular I was ready to strangle, with hair or without, by the time she up and died. It's historically interesting as a spark to abolitionism and to the beginning of the Civil War, but as a novel it's dreadful. I would warn you not to read it, but you probably have already or will soon for a U.S. history class, in which case please accept my deepest condolences."
5,A Powerful and Moving Book,"It is easy to see why this book became the clarion call for abolitionism prior to the Civil War. The narrative is riviting and powerfully wrought with characters so vividly rendered I felt I could almost reach out and touch them. I first became acquainted with excerpts of this book in high school but never read it in its entirety. Now that I have finally completed it 46 years lager, it ranks as one of the most compelling novels I have read."
4,Uncle Tom's Cabin,This book is a classic and teaches you a lot about American history. It should be part of your classic library on your device.
5,A must read for all !!,Exactly what I expected when I made the purchase. This book is hard to find in our libraries I feel that all people should read this.
5,"Great story, well done!","I bought this to listen to on my commute to school, since I was required to read it for a class. When trying to read the book, I found it difficult to understand at times. This CD is so well done, I never had any problem understanding what was going on. Buck Schirner does an excellent job of reading the story, getting the dialect and conveying the characters. I would and have already recommended this CD. Stowe's story is a classic and this CD is one I'm keeping!"
2,substandard printing,The publisher of this pricey printing did not take care to check the pages of the text for successful copying. Some pages were so poorly copied they were illegible. Substandard quality control. I had to return the book.
3,"Important for its time, but....","As a study of the past, this book has some merit. That's all. It may have enlightened the country as to the plight of the slave, but the rest of it was too saccharine. Much of the story is contrived, and the characters are exaggerated. The good characters are very good, and the bad characters are very bad. However, they do serve the purpose--you will hate the slave owners by the end, and sympathize completely with the slaves. This certainly isn't a bad thing. Just don't pick up this book expecting some original story full of deep characters."
5,A view into slavery,"This book makes you gasp, cry, and have occasional tearful smiles while you read this story that shows you the unjust of slavery. This book started the Civil War because of its content and its author Stowe was famed for her viewpoints against slavery. A must-read."
4,Uncle Tom's Cabin,"Growing up I became aware of the atrocities that mankind can visit upon his brethren because of Harriet Beecher Stowe's book. After reading the book on my Kindle, I was moved by the impact of what slavery can do to both the slave and the slave owner. The sad commentary about forced slavery is that in 2011 it still exits in some quarters of the world."
5,Uncle Tom's Cabin,How I ever got out of high school & college without being required to read this I will never know. But better late than never. It was perfect. Slavery is wrong no matter how kind the master. So amazing to see how people fooled themselves into believing they were practicing Christians while owning slaves. Some aspects of slavery you may never have considered like what happens when the master dies or goes into debt. All Americans should read it in order to know history.
1,race-relations propaganda,"absolutely tedious, over-wrought--morality tale one of those books they make you analyze to death in english class. not worth the money"
1,"Not a fan of 'Uncle Tom's Cabin"" !","This has to be one of the most poorly written books I've ever read. A lot of it was simply the author's boring narrative and opinions. Parts of the book probably more or less correctly depicted the treatment of slaves during that era; other than that, I can't think of one redeeming thing to say about this book, other than reading it is a good way to get to sleep if you have insomnia."
3,A Book,"I haven't read this book yet, but I will soon. probably tommorrow.I am in sixth grade.Don't laugh at me. My teacher said I was smart enough.Redwall is better!"
3,Ok I guess,"Well I bought this book for a summer reading assignment and I have to say it isn't the most interesting book in fact I don't really like it at all. I know its a classic but seriously, read this only if you must. The only plus side is that this is the cheapest version of it haha."
4,great book,"It was a great book, so glad I read it. It was a hard read for me though. I usually only take a week or two for a book, this one took me about a month and a half just because I wasnt used to the language (& sadly had to use the preloaded dictionary on my kindle several times). But all in all Im very very glad I read it!"
5,Magnificent book!,"The author does an outstanding job describing the time period, people's struggles, their virtues and shortcomings. The Christian faith and the role of the church throughout the narrative was particularly enlightening to me, personally. I highly recommend the book!"
3,I'm Quite Torn!,"First, let me say that I enjoyed Uncle Tom's Cabin; for the good of it, for the bad of it! There is an element of fantasy to the young, blonde, child who dies, and as is with many, many current television shows, the ""gifted"" are always Caucasian. That fact, in and of itself, doesn't allow for the development of most of the black characters in the book. However, on the positive side, Ms. Beecher-Stowe seems a steadfast abolitionist, of sorts, and the messages of Love, and Hope, and Equality (fairness), ring loudly, and she takes great pain to ""detail"" the negativity that prevents the Declaration Of Independence from meeting it's mission. As a side note: It was unfortunately that Abraham Lincoln died shortly after the end of the Civil War, as the decision as to what to do with Blacks had not been fully thought out, with no chance of actualization! ere in 2012, the decision as to what to do with Blacks, still has not been made!"
1,Garbage made to spread hate,This book is an entire work of fiction by a person claiming it to be first hand experience. None of it acttually happend ans was written entirely to spread hate and anger. Don't waste your time on this trash.
3,Good but ...,"I read this from a sense of obligation ... and probably 40 years too late to appreciate it fully. It was funny enough, I'll say that ... but I wasn't floored the way most are when the book's title is brought up. I guess kids should read it ... or anything, really.So, parents, smash those dopey video game machines and text message things and introduce your brats to a library ... or amazon ... or a local book store."
5,Uncle Tom's Cabin Book,"What a wonderful book, it should be mandatory reading in every school, I am still amazed that people many decades ago, as today use the bible to discriminate against minorities, shameful. Great book."
2,Disappointing,"Language too difficult. On some occasions, the slaves spoke very good English in contrast to the uneducated owners. The author gave no explanation."
4,something to think about,"Uncle Toms Cabin was an interesting book discussing the hardships of slavery in the 1800s. It takes you through life in the eyes of a slave, Tom. Uncle Toms Cabin shows you the hardships slaves went through to not get a beating from their master, though many endured that anyway. It opened my eyes to the reality of slavery, and the severity of it all. The book not only talks about slavery, but it also addresses the issue of religion. Although I did not get a chance to read Uncle Toms Cabin carefully, I enjoyed what I could of it and would definitely re-read it so I could get a better understanding.i would also definitely recommend this book to anyone that is interested in reading about the slavery issues of the 1800s."
5,Sad story,This story is very sad story. Tom was killed by his cold hearted master.I think this book made the antislavery movement in USA.
4,a pretty quick read,"I decided I should finally read this book. After struggling through Beloved and Lord Jim I feared I wouldn't understand a word of Uncle Tom's Cabin. But it read quite easily, and the story was pretty compelling. I was a little surprised at the religious argument in this book.I have to admit I am still a little puzzled on why ""uncle tom"" is a slur. While Tom is subservient to his masters his moral character makes him oppose his masters several times."
3,A classical must read,"I am surpised I didn't read this book years ago. Harriet Beecher Stower demonstrated uncommon courage in writing such a novel challenging the institution of slavery during her day. Sometimes I thought the characters seemed very real but at other times they were a bit too over drawn, (Tom was too good, and the little girl much too angelic to be real). However, overall, I thought it was a good read. Some people might think it too moralistic, however."
4,Thumbs Up!,Interesting story!This was a interesting story about a time when life was extremely difficult cor the African American race!
4,Great book but ..,"This is one of the best classics that I've ever read, other than A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens. The reason why I gave it an 8 because Uncle Tom's Cabin's literary terms were quite hard to comprhend... Otherwise, it's a great, warm, heart wrenching book.. It's a must read!"
2,captures the essence of slavery but not the realities,"There is no doubt in anyone's mind that Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel has been unequaled in its vast political influence. However, it contains one major flaw. Although the book treats slavery with a simple and determined resolution, and reduces slavery to what it really was (EVIL), the book ends with a happy and most improbable ending. Stowe might have been attempting to show that ultimately, good reigns over evil, but the message of the extreme urgency of the abolitionist movement is lost in the fairy tale ending."
3,classic - sentimental - historically biased -,classic - sentimental - historically biased -but useful to 21st century grandchildren toknow background of american race relations
3,I didnt like the book but someone else might,I have a hard time reading it because it writen like how southerners talked back then. but thats just me.read it and make up your own mind a book can be disliked by some and loved by others so read it yourself and make up your mind weather you like or dislike it.
3,BOADING GATE,"I only purchased this movie because Isia Argento looked sexy in it, it is not a bad movie if you are bored you can watch it and waste some time on it."
2,terrible title,"this album should be called ""randomly assorted for no collective reason hip hop vol 1"""
5,A True Grimoire,"If you need to explain the concepts of magic too a non-practitioner; this is the book for you! Sane and well formulated, this tome tears away the thin veneer placed over society's eyes by the (ignorant) who THINK they know the secrets of reality. Ramsey Dukes presents many paradigms that step over the bounds of manufactured social saftey .... ""blessings too those that have the courage in removing the glamour cast upon them by certain factions of the social network."" Read ... learn ... become empowered!!!"
5,Changed my life,"Le Tigre is my favorite band and this is their best album. I'm not sure how it would appeal to people who ""aren't into that kind of thing,"" but this album makes me cry...."
2,"2 girls, 3 girls, or no girls...does it matter?","If going to see a concert doesn't neccicarily expect the creation of live music, then I guess this band is ok.But I went to see Le Tigre play-- and while they did get everybody to dance, I was shocked to see that all they did for half their songs was press play and then dance metaphorically-sloppy corriographed dance moves. The Le Tigre experience means shouting a ""mediocre"" theme repeatedly and jumping from side to side tossing your head... I just think other bands have achieved this and even more. I am concearned because of how old most of the audience was... in their late teens and early 20s. Maybe it's the X and coke and heroine coming back in place of LSD... kids are not wandering into other levels of the room, they are ripping up the sheets and jumping on the bed of rock and roll."
3,Tries a bit hard --,"Le Tigre is a feminist, quasi-lesbian band that uses sparse, minimalist techno to prove their point. In order to enjoy, you must be willing to hear the lyrics screamed and shouted. Maybe the members will go on to bigger and better things with a broader based appeal."
4,It would be five stars if Hanna didn't scare me 10 years ago,"...Her current musical endeavors with are waaay more interesting and fun to listen to than her pervious efforts. Raw disco at times, the way new wave flirtations always should be. The production is fab! Though some of the feminist anger on this record is healthy, lyrically from time to time it just feels patronizing, like an Oliver Stone film. I'd like to see more raw disco!!! And for that, it's worth the purchase!"
3,They're sooo Devo!,"These women are carrying on the artistic sensibilities originally brought to us by Mark Mothersbaugh et al (Devo). It's a fun, light record that has a go at social commentary and makes a few successful jabs. It is half full of infectious hooks and all full of fun. Buy this Le Tigre record first, it might be the only one you need. And check out Devo if you don't already know them, at least for context."
3,Odd mix,"Le Tigre is a band with some simple but interesting musical ideas, and this album shows more polish than any previous releases by any of the band members. There are some good melodies and vocal layerings. Unfortunately for me, the whole thing is marred by the hopelessly annoying California accents of the singers, which makes them sound like uneducated teenybopper dingalings. This facet of their presentation is at odds with their attempts to sound intelligent and pure. Instead we get an odd postmodern mix of wit and feminism with teen angst and immaturity. Hard to swallow whole."
4,VGI,"Another solid effort from Kathleen Hanna and friends. It is slightly better than ""Julie Ruin"" because the songwriting is improved and the production is better. ""Le Tigre"" is like the best 80's new wave album you never heard, utilizing old drum machine and keyboard technology to perfection. Songs like ""What's Yr Take on Cassavettes"" and ""My My Metrocard"" are irresistably catchy, yet contain the necessary subversive elements that make Hanna's work so excellent. While ""Julie Ruin"" was probably geared more toward her fans, ""Le Tigre"" can be enjoyed by anybody willing to listen to some fun, thought provoking music."
3,A favorite of my childhood,"As a cat loving little girl, this was the perfect book for me. As an adult, I see obvious holes in the plot, but at the time I enjoyed the balance of elementary adoration and angst.A little girl with a wonderful cat (Miss Kitty) finds out she is going to be a big sister, and she is thrilled, until she finds out that Miss Kitty will have to go when the baby arrives (for whatever reason, her parents thought that a cat would be a huge danger). I remember agonizing with the heroine about this huge loss coupled with a huge gain. Of course, it all pretty much works out for Miss Kitty who happily ends up on a farm where her former owner's family can visit her, and the main character does become widely attatched to her baby sibling.Good book choice for that tween who can't read enough kitty stories, or is soon-to-be a big sibling."
4,I Can't Review,This was given as part of a wedding gift set. I have not heard pro nor con about this item from the receiving couple
5,sturdy piece,"MY WIFE USE THIS TENDERIZER FOR THE FIRST TIME, FOUND IT TO BE DURABLE AND WELL BALANCED ABOVE ALL IT DID THE JOB IT WAS MADE FOR."
2,Just ok,I used it for the first time last night. Worked well as far as the pounding part but I put it in the dishwasher and it came out dull with lots of gray stuff rubbing off. That is why I replaced my old one that had belonged to my mother. If you can't put a meat pounder in the dw what good is it.
2,DO NOT PUT IN DISHWASHER,"I love OXO utensils and have many of them. But I looked for quite a while for a meat tenderizer and missed the review that said not to put this tenderizer in the dishwasher. Pound raw meat; wash it in the dishwasher in hot water, right? The tenderizer I was replacing was aluminum. Now this one looks like old aluminum--it's gray and nasty looking. Not something I paid extra for to get stainless steel. It's totally not up to par with the usual OXO utensils."
4,Cant put in Dishwasher! Heads up!,I got this meat tenderizer today and as always oxo has made a great product however I must admit I was a little dissapointed that it CANNOT BE PUT INTO THE DISHWASHER. The dishwasher is a staple in my everyday life... I clean everything with it...and its a bummer I cant put the tenderizer in it too... oh well... its still a well made product.
1,"Aluminum, NOT SS, NOT stainless steel","It can NOT be BOTH brushed stainless steel handle AND 1 piece aluminum construction. Read the reviews, it doesn't survive the dishwasher so it IS aluminum and it is NOT stainless steel. The picture clearly shows 1 piece construction, which is aluminum."
4,meat tenderizer,we usually buy the less tender meat and this product is perfect for tederizing the meat to perfection ..i would recommend it .
4,"Good meat tenderizer, great crumbler","I like the weight and feel of it in my hand. Does the tenderizing fine, will check out the better model referred to by another reviewer. What I've been using this tool more often for is to crumble club crackers I put in a zip loc baggie. I use the flat part and it does a fine job in quick time. I put the finely crumbled crackers over fish, apply cooking spray, then bake."
4,"Typical OXO quality, but keep it out of the dishwasher","We've got OXO everything, and for good reason. They're high quality, very stylish looking, and are comfortable to use. The meat tenderizer is no exception. Solidly built, great handle, perfect weight for hammering those filets thin or beating some of the toughness out of a steak.We made the mistake of putting ours in the dishwasher. Big mistake. The shiny glossy metal got cloudy. This is too bad, because I like to wash anything that comes in contact with meat in the hottest water possible. But treat it like you would a good knife (wash it by hand) and you'll be fine."
3,Works fine,"This works fine, it's nicely balanced and has a comfortable grip. Why only three stars? Can't wash it in the dishwasher."
1,Do Not Put In DIsh Washer,"Made the mistake of putting OXO Good Grips Meat Tenderizer in the dishwasher. I was getting ready to use it and noticed gray smudging on my fingers. Then I rubbed my fingers along the face of it and metal powder was coming off of it! I thought it was made of lead or pewter since I've never seen aluminum come off so easily. Since this wasn't the first time it's seen the dishwasher, I began to wonder how much of this stuff I've ingested. I would not recommend this to anyone. I'm throwing mine out. Be careful not to put it in the dishwasher, better yet, find one that's stainless steel."
4,"A good, thorough astronomical encyclopedia","So far,I haven't found a single astronomical term that was missing or one for which the encyclopedia gave less than satisfactory explanation."
1,"Dull, Dull, Dull!",The tool really is good for nothing! the blades were dull and the herbs just became a stringy mess!
1,More like an herb smasher,"I only used it twice before it hit the trash can. For one, the plastic top cracked. For two, it only bruised and smashed the herbs. It was okay for some herbs, like rosemary. But any herbs that have moisture in them were justed smashed. I'm back to using old faithfull, a good chefs knife."
1,Worthless!,"The Oxo rolling mincer is lacking one important feature: Blades! It has thin little discs of metal, but they aren't blades. They are dull, dull, dull and do nothing but mash your herbs to pieces. Do you really want finely hammered herbs? It's like replacing a chef knife with a screwdriver. Ok, it's missing a couple more features: It's too small and the ""blades"" don't rotate independently. After the first use I noticed one of the ""blades"" had already bent about 5-10 degrees from parallel (which would have been prevented with independent blades). For quantity tasks, it is far slower than a chef knife. Try a nice double- or triple-bladed Mezzaluna instead. Mezzalunas have real blades that can be re-sharpened. (But don't buy one with a matching bowl shaped cutting board, they completely ruin the rocking action of the Mezzaluna)."
4,Quick and durable!,"I've had this for well over a year and use it at least once a week. It chops a large bunch of cilantro or basil in a few seconds. The blades are still very sharp and it looks like new. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that while I like how it disassembles so completely to wash away every little piece, I wish it were a bit easier to do so.There is such a wide division in the reviews here that I wonder if using different types of cutting boards could make a difference. I've always used an acrylic one with mine."
1,USELESS,The OXO Miner does not mince. It only bruised basil and parsley. We are still trying to find out what we can use it for.
1,cannot cut through basil!,"Maybe the micer I received had dull blades, but it would not cut through leaves of fresch basil! I tired several times with pressure and on different surfaces, but it only made dents in it and I ended up cutting it with my knife. I am going to buy a mezzaluna and return this thing!"
1,Rolling herb mutilator,"Like all OXO products, this is ergonomic. However, it has the slight flaw that it doesn't actually mince herbs. Tried it with parsely, a fairly durable herb that slices easily. The herb mincer managed to slice through some of the leaves on top, but left a layer of mutilated leaves underneath! It did not matter how hard I pushed, the bruised leaves would not cut! Even if it did work the wheels are not closely spaced enough to mince; I would describe it as closer to chopped. You will be much better off with a sharp knife than with this worse than useless product. I returned mine the same day."
1,gathers dust in my kitchen,"it simply doesn't do the job. only bruises the herbs. i normally love oxo products, but this one is a disappointment."
2,Desert Storm,I own this game but I would never call it a game. It is a great resource for information about Desert Storm but it does not play well.
3,Well done for the budget!,"Low-budget indie film about a signal that comes through your TV and turns people into paranoid killers. It's always fun to see what directors can do with a truly limited budget, and this one looked and sounded pretty good, especially considering it was made for $50,000. Also interesting that it's done in three parts, each one by a different director. So one section is somewhat comedic, while another is more standard horror/thriller."
3,"So, this is a comedy. Right?","If you view it as a comedy, it's not horrible. But, really, if you're looking for a tense horror film, you should probably look elsewhere. It's trying to do what Iñárritu has made famous, with the connected storylines that play separately, which I totally understand. It's a great way to tell a story (or three). But this just comes off as disjointed, the tone is not maintained, and it allows the plots to be very superficial. Just when you think you might delve deeper, the film moves on to something else. Skip this one, or have friends over and make a drinking game out of it. (""Every time Lewis hits someone with a blunt object, take a drink!"" ""The signal! Take a shot!"")"
2,A Letdown,the movie promised much and delivered nothing!! Two stars for the actors who did a good job with a lousy scenario and plot.
2,Not as good as expected,"I was looking forward to this movie when I read about it, but after seeing it I was disappointed. It started out good but then slowly became boring and uninteresting. The beginning and end are really good but the middle just slows down too much and becomes convoluted. It could have been 20 minutes shorter and would have been better. You could tell each of the 3 portions was directed by a different person."
1,Worst Movie of the Decade???,"I don't know if this is the worst film of the decade, but it's certainly in the top 5. What a let down. I had not viewed this picture before buying the DVD, wish I had, could have saved $18.99. It's even more now! I love GOOD SCI-FI, and this is unbelievably BAD SCI-FI. If you've seen this movie an want to buy it, good for you, but, if you've been waiting for the DVD release to see it, do yourself a favor and rent it first, you may decide it's better not to clutter your collection with this stinker!"
1,So bad I threw it out,"Bad movie, bad plot bad everything. watched 5 minutes and literally threw it in the garbage. I did not even bother reselling it because no one would want it."
2,DIFFERENT,This movie had a lot of possibilities but feel flat in the end. I think it was an interested concept very similar to Pontypool from 2008 but not as good. I just don't like how when it's directed they get you so confussed at where it's going that you wonder at the end if it was real or made up in your head? Hard to follow and almost a Dark Comedy in my opinion.Not very well done...
3,YOU ALMOST KILLED MY WIFE!!!,"An independent horror that I will call a jem. I saw this at a friends on a Saturday night before a figh...was a little buzzed but loved the flick. I searched it out and bought it and watched it again with cleaner blood and loved it. A horror with a dash of comedy relief this flick is a winner. The screenplay does fall apart a bit in the middle, but finds itself again and wraps up neatly."
2,Signal Stinker,"A hynotizing signal over the airwaves, telephones, etc. makes people crazed psychopathic killers,everyone is killing everyone, but amazingly a few survive to stretch out this stinkeroo for way toolong. If Stephen King's ""Cell'"" is supposed to be like this-forget it too,... I will bet ""Cell"" is better.Did not recognize any actors. they all were way too dramatic and bad. This DVD belongs in the trashcan.I tried very painfully to watch this movie, and my brother sat there also,..we both thought it hurled.Will never watch it again. Whatever reviews say that this is a good watch belong in the cast of thisstinker film."
2,The Signal,"The actors were fantastic but the film itself contained too much blood, gore and senseless killing. Purchase only if you love blood and killing in films."
1,Has no meaning but killing and beating each others,This movie has no meaning or story to tell except beating and killing each other for no reason from start to end.
5,How does that letter get to Grandma and Grandpa?,"This delightful book will encourage your little ones to write a letter and show them just how much time and effort goes into delivering a message of love to brighten someone's day. Through rain, sleet, snow - through hill and dale, follow seven little postmen as they work together to deliver a letter from a little boy to his Grandma. Teacher's might enjoy this resource as a Read Aloud to go with writing practice for grades 1-3, especially.lisa_westbrook@onebranch.org"
5,"""Sakes alive! What is it about?"" Sakes alive! The secret is out!","I really love children's books that sweep the reader away on long journeys. Harold and the Purple Crayon is one such book. So, too, are the Phantom Tollbooth and, of course, Tolkien's works. The Seven Little Postmen does this on a more mundane level, but the journey is enjoyable, nonetheless. Here, Margaret Wise Brown and Tibor Gergely lead us across bustling city streets, fly us through sleet and hail, and send us roaring along shining rails, ""Through gloom of night / In a mail car filled with electric light"". Not only do we meet seven postmen along the way, but also a cast of colorful characters, including Mrs. Potter, ""Who was busy making jam"". With chickens and tires delivered R.F.D. via a crank-start motor, Mr. Gergely's distinct and detailed illustrations evoke a time now long gone.I also recommend Scuffy the Tugboat and His Adventures Down the River, likewise illustrated by Tibor Gergely."
5,Best Little Golden Book,I want to own all of Margaret Wise Brown's books. Her sing-song writing style just lifts me. I also liked that the boy in the story is so thoughtful toward his little grandmother.
5,Great companion to the Unabridged CD Set,"I have everything Doreen Virtue has ever published. Her books, tapes and CDs are always so clear and easy to understand. There is no filler or fluff, just uplifting stories and wonderful exercises to help you nourish your soul. Hays House produces fantastic books, card decks and kits. This particular kit works well alone or with the unabridged CD version of Connecting with your Angels.This kit includes:A special workbook filled with easy-to-follow stepsA new CD in which Doreen guides you through the process of discovering your angels' identities and messagesA journal that will allow you to track your angelic communicationsA rose quartz crystal to help you feel your angels' loving guidanceNatural incense to help elevate your spiritual frequency12 original angel oracle cards to help you instantly connect with your angelsDead Sea bath salts to help you clear away negativity from your mind and body"
5,Good insite for beginners / skeptics,"The kit is a good introduction to the world of angels. It gives insight to beginners (like me), but I will say, it leaves you wanting to know more. I would recommend this to anyone who is curious about angels. It's a small investment that can break down skepticisms one might have. I wasn't sure about all of this ""connecting with your angels"" stuff at first. But once you give them a chance, they can help guide you in life. They've come though for me whenever I've asked them to. When I bought this kit I also purchased the archangel oracle card set. I was surprised at how accurate they can be. I'm a believer, now, and Doreen Virtue really seems to know her stuff. I have purchased other books, CDs, ect. from her. Hope this helps."
4,Great for focusing your energy,I'm more spiritual than religious and this kit was very useful in helping me focus my positive energy. It's very difficult after a long day to find some positive energy for those around you and I look at products like this as tools to help you center yourself and get into the right frame of mind to love others and yourself. We've used several Doreen Virtue products over the years and I've been very satisfied with their quality and durability. I would recommend this to anyone that has a reasonable expectation of what these tools can do for you.
1,Best of the West,"I am a fan of Riders in the Sky; however, the quality of the back up instrumentation was terrible and I was disappointed in the overall quality of this CD."
1,The tracks are wrong.,"I hate to say this but the people saying the tracks are wrong are right. There are 14 tracks of original artists doing classic western songs like Back in the Saddle Again (I swear it's Autry) and Tumbling Tumbleweeds (the same version used in The Big Lebowski). It is definitely not the Riders (who I have seen live and heard recorded). I think there may be secret bonus tracks, but I am guessing they don't transition to the Riders' tracks or there was a manufacturing error and for some buyers the Riders' stuff never got burned. Those who get the Riders should count your blessings."
2,Titles are Wrong,"This CD is a suprise package...the titles listed bear no resemblance to what's on the CD. The music is good, you just don't know what song will be next."
1,Titles are wrong!,"The titles on this disc and it's liner notes are not what is actually on the disc. Further, there are only 14 tracks on the disc and the CD lists 22! It's nice music never-the-less, but for my purpose I like to know the title of the songs that I'm listening to. Otherwise I would have given this a higher rating."
4,Yes with an edge.,"With the addition of Patrick Moraz as Rick Wakeman's replacement, Yes regrouped with this LP, a harder, edgier musical statement than they had made previously. The record has a metallic, cold sound, and the song structures are more coherent than the previous LP 'Tales from Topograhic Oceans.' The band's ensemble sound is much more aggressive here, at times approaching jazz fusion. ""The Gates of Delirium"" is probably the best example of the 20-minute Yes track, while ""To Be Over"" basks in sheer beauty of sound and lyric. I would group this LP in with ""Fragile"" and ""Close to the Edge"" as required Yes listening."
4,Close to ....five stars !,"Close to the edge is a five stars album, Relayer is not, although it is a great Yes CD. Gates of Delerium is one of the top epic in the Yes catalogue, not as great as Close to the edge, but not far from it.Sound Chaser and To be over are also great, but not as good as And you and I and Siberian Kathru. For this reason, Relayer deserves a four stars, but it is real close to a five stars rating. It is a less known album that Fragile or Close to the Edge but still an essential cd for serious Yes fan."
3,Hard to like.,"I have tried for two years to like this album, as I love earlier Yes (except Tales). No luck so far."
1,Sometimes Less Is More,Rhino should have released the bonus tracks in a separate package and left all these classic early Yes albums the way they were meant to be.
4,Relayer - Yes,"An outstanding album, especially if you are a guitarist as it displays the fine talents of Steve Howe.This album is a ""must-have"" for your collection."
5,"Moody, atmospheric, classic, different","Relayer is a really good album by the masters of progressive rock, Yes. The album contains just three songs, but they're long songs, the longest being The Gates Of Delirium, clocking in at 21:55. The music is classic early '70s Yes -- lots of keyboards, synthesizers, strange guitar, and Jon Anderson's high pitched vocals, not to mention epic-length songs. The best track in my opinion is The Gates Of Delirium. The second track, Sound Chaser, is quite bizarre and entertaining. The album closes with the song To Be Over. This is a strong effort by Yes that belongs in every true Yes fan's collection. Outstanding."
4,A very unknown album is a very good album,"Yes's ""Relayer"" seems to be the one album that is the least known, except for Die Hard Yes fans. Even though its no where near the greatness of ""The Yes Album"", ""Fragile"", and ""Close to the Edge"" it still is worth getting to add to your Yes collection. Its only has a handful of songs on it, and it seems to be written more in the style of ""Close to the Edge"" with complex songs and sheer energy. Even though its not perfect, its pretty damn good, and I cant recommend it enough for fans of Yes, and for those that aren't that familer with the band. Yes were the kings of progressive Rock, and this album, along with thier many others, will always be a classic."
1,what?,"yeah, yeah, she has one good song so they decide to put it on there three times and barely change it and charge you ten bucks, I mean, is that supposed to be a joke? Why pay ten bucks for a song when you can download it free, and then burn it, you'd think record companies would catch on"
2,"A good idea, but lacks depth and interest","This illustrated book helps a child understand a parent's depression. We need more books on this topic, especially when my favorite one, Please Don't Cry Mom, is out of print. Why Are You So Sad gives straightforward information, but the plot and illustrations seem one dimensional. I did not find myself drawn in by the characters. I had a couple of children look at it. One said that it sounded ""accurate"" but they did not find it interesting.Children of a depressed parent need to hear this sort of information, so I will keep the book. A parent or counselor might be better off reading the book themselves, and making up their own story based on the factual material presented in the book. Sad Days, Glad Days does not have as much factual material but has better illustrations and conveys more warmth."
3,Moms are not the only ones who get depression!,"Overall the book has a good format for speaking with your children about depression, BUT this book like so many others infers that the depressed parent is the mother. I had heard it was impartial and the language is impartial, but all of the pictures show a depressed mother. Children the age that this book is targeted at are much more visual and they will focus on the pictures."
1,It's a Pass,"I'd have to agree with the first reviewer. this one is not worth your time. i had very high expecations as i love this genre of illustration and graphic design... and there was hardly any content! i'm not even sure how they actually had enough pages to bind this book. the cover was the most exciting part. Look to some great titles like ""UNCOVERED: the hidden art of the girlie pulps"" and you'll be much more satisfied."

5,Best filter bags yet,"These filter bags are excellent if you need to vacuum fine particles such as dry wall dust. While they are not inexpensive, they will prevent what you are vacuuming from being blown out of the exhaust outlet They are a little difficult to install but if you carefully fllow the instructions printed on the bag, you shouldn't have any problems."
5,Vacuum saver.,"I bought this for aVacmaster VBV1210 Detachable Blower Wet/Dry Vacuum, 12 Gallon, 5 Peak HPwith aVacmaster VCFH Hepa Fine Dust Cartridge Vacuum Filter & RetaiWhat can I say - if you hate cleaning the junk you vacuumed, and if you like keeping your tools clean: buy this. I know it is somewhat expensive, but it is all worth it. They hold great, they don't tear, and they are big. Try it - you probably won't go back to no-bag vacuuming."
2,Falls apart,"They fall apart when the slightest bit wet or when they get full. Not a good product unless you keep it dry and empty it when it is half full, doubling the cost."
5,barbecue ash removal,I use these to clean ashes out of my Komodo Kamado ceramic cooker. Just wait until the fire is totally out!!! These bags collect the fine ash cleanly and work perfect for this application.
5,sliders,excellent from start to finish lots of action great acting very understandable story lines but final season blah not interesting wont purchase fifth and final season
5,"80's, 80's, 80's!","This is by far one of the most eighties songs ever. It makes me laugh just to hear it. It brings me back to a time of teased hair, hot pink, and bad taste. If you loved the eighties, Pretty in Pink, you know, then you will love this song."
4,Mellow and smooth!,"Very good digital reproduction of Nat King Cole's best love songs. You can't go wrong with this collection. Nice and mellow, very smooth. Most of these classics are truly Unforgettable."
5,Good to have Nat,"I had a cassette with Nat King Cole years ago and got this to reignite that flame. He is a smooth, suave, sentimental favorite."
5,so dreamy,"He is a one-of-a-kind so mellow, love this cd, best yet, perfect, can't describe any more than what it is."
5,Splendid experience,"I used these songs to play at my parents' recent 50th anniversay party. I synchronized it with silent home movies from over the decades. Friends and relatives were in tears with joy and emotion. Special emphasis to tracks 1, 6, and 12....very touching songs performed by a man gifted with an exceptional voice. My highest recommendation."
5,Love It!,Every song on this CD is a winner. Love to play it softly in the background while I'm working in my home office. Highly recommend.
3,"Topics explained in clarity,bit too much for undergraduates.",A wide variety of topics have been covered with considerable clarity and depth.Though some of it maybe a bit overboard for undergrads it is better suited to a grads taste.
3,"""Walking Down"" Down Slightly","After my excitement at discovering the absolutely smokin' Bennie Green discWith Art Farmer(see my review), I was delighted to come across an inexpensive copy of the rare, out-of-print ""Walking Down"" recently. Recorded two and a half months after ""BG with AF"" on June 29, 1956, this session unfortunately doesn't have the star power of its predecesor, and that's the primary reason why it's not as good. Simply put, local unheralded NYC players Eric Dixon on tenor sax, Lloyd Mayers on piano, Sonny Wellesley on bass and Bill English on drums (I don't think I have any of these men on a single disc in my 1500+ jazz collection) cannot replace the likes of Art and Addison Farmer and Philly Joe! If you see ""Walking Down"" come down in price then go for it, but otherwise use your money to pick up the 3CD Mosaic Select of his wonderful recordings for Blue Note."
2,Elegant vs. Ordinary,"Okay so I purchased several rubber ducks for my daughters first birthday. I was so disappointed when I received 1 $15.00 rubber duck in the mail after purchasing what I thought was six rubber ducks. The item was titled ""Elegant Baby Polka Dot Duck Asst."" and the picture to the item showed six ducks. When in fact you only get one duck. Needless to say, there is nothing special about the rubber duck. I was disappointed to say the least. It was cute but not worth $15.00."
1,Design Flaw in OXO Knives,"My Son, who is a Culinary graduate, purchased a set of OXO knives for me as a gift. I know they were not inexpensive. However, within a year, three of the six knives seperated from the grips during use. While the grips are quite nice, the knives are dangerous to use and can cause serious injury in the kitchen. They should be removed from the market. In all three cases, the blades flipped upwards during slicing."
1,Razor Sharp - sometimes convenient,"The only reason that I give the mini chef knife (I have not used the paring knife) one star is because its size has sometimes come in handy and the blade is extremely sharp.WORDS OF WARNING - <1> the grip has a tendency to move/slide while you are using the knife... do not use this knife to cut anything that would require significant pressure! <2> The back side of the blade is also very sharp! I have better than average culinary skills and have cut myself twice on the back of this knife. <3> Though it is a small, cute knife, only a fool would think that this knife would be a good ""junior"" knife for a kid who wants to cut and cook like Mommy (or in my case, Daddy)."
1,very poor quality for OXO,"I love OXO products and own almost every product, but these knives are very poorly made. I had three sets, and the handles eventually came off on all six knives- very unsafe! Some handles slipped off, and some snapped off. I'm surprised OXO is still making and selling these knives, because the poor quality really tarnishes their reputation."
5,get the mini-chef knife!,"The paring knife is fine, but I was moved to write this review by my love for the mini chef knife. Everyone I know who's tried it is now a convert... it chops everything (including large onions) easily without the unwieldiness of a larger knife, and it's very sharp, not to mention cute. As one of my housemates said, ""Now I don't bother with any other knife, I just ask 'where's the excellent knife?'"""
5,Library Cornerstone,"Fabulous, could not get along without it. Unique index. Got my copy when I was 12 and loved every page. This is where I learned what music was worth listening to and searching out the unfamiliar. Ws the basis for my first catalog of my records. On short list of essential music books, worth every cent. And best of all, it was written by lawyers, believe it or not. Copyright lawyers needed an easy reference to check on music piracy and here it is. The companion book on vocal music is just as good."
4,Brilliant addition to your music collection.,"This disctionary contains all the famous musical themes you've heard on CD, radio or even at the concerts that seem to stay in your mind but you can never remember the name of the piece or the composer. Well this disctionary allows you to find the origin of those lingering notes in your mind and is great when you can find it by the index at the back through the pitches and keys. Although the idea was brilliant, the book does fall short because of copyright reasons. Many of the works couldn't be published because of copyright. Otherwise this is a brilliant collection to your music library."
2,not pictured,"This item is described correctly, but the picture is the floor nozzle that is about 1"" x 14"" that works much better. The wide opening on this piece is not good floor finished and is prone to scratching floors"
5,Still great after all these years,"This was a great live CD when it came out and remains a great (and now remastered) CD. Live Dead, Skull & Roses, and Europe '72 captured what the Dead was like in concert in 1969-1972. Of course, there are now plenty of Dick's Picks and Vault CDs that also capture this period, but these 3 CDs remain relevant to any Deadhead. The addition of Two Souls in Communion on CD 1 and extra live tracks on CD 2 make the package that much better."
4,Once indispensable,"This may sound sacrilegious, but this once indispensable album has been surpassed by later releases from the same tour (Hundred Year Hall, Steppin' Out, and Rockin' the Rhein). While the producers may have thought that Playing in the Band, Dark Star, Turn on Your Lovelight, The Other One, et al. weren't ready for primetime, get one of the other three sets if you're only going to own one album from the Europe '72 tour."
3,essential in the 70's but...,"Many of these songs were released for the first time here and are great (and some do not exist in a studio version). However, I do not think this album is as essential today as it was 30 years ago.Dick Picks of the period (23 and 11), Steppin'out and 100 year hall are all better: flow, performance, spontaneity.Still a good introduction to many sides of the Dead: jamming, ballads, country and Grateful Dead rock (which is soft rock)"
3,"UNA MUESTRA MAS DEL TALENTO DE ESTA BANDA, NADA MAS Y NADA MENOS......","NO ES NI EL MEJOR NI EL PEOR DE LA INNUMERABLE LISTA DE GRABACIONES EN VIVO DE ESTA LEGENDARIA BANDA.....NADIE DISCUTE EL VALOR CREATIVO Y SENTIMENTAL DE UN GRUPO QUE HIZO ESCUELA Y SUPO PERDURAR A TRAVES DEL TIEMPO...... EDICION RECOMENDABLE, REFLEJA UN PARTICULAR MOMENTO DE LA BANDA, ESENCIAL PARA COLECCIONISTAS, PERO EN DEFINITIVA, NO AGREGA NADA NUEVO AL EXCESIVO LEGADO MUSICAL DE UN GRUPO QUE DEBE SER UNO DE LOS POCOS QUE HA CONSEGUIDO PLASMAR EN CD'S TODA, DIGO BIEN, TODA SU HISTORIA!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Such a letdown,"I had never listened to this album, but so many of their live recording from Europe in 72 were just excellent, so I decided to buy it unheard. I was so disappointed to hear these tracks- they're slow and drawn out. I guess it's a more relaxed show, good for people that want to chill out, but I just feel like they weren't giving me what I wanted to hear, like the album was just a big tease. I really dislike 'American Beauty' as an album and I guess I put this into a similar category. If you dislike AB (not exactly common within the dead community) then stay away from Europe '72."
2,This remastered version is actually a step backwards in sound quality!,"What a big dissapointment this Rhino remaster was! As soon as I played it I noticed that it sounded worst than my original copy of the Warner Bors. CD release.This remaster is about 5-6 dbs louder than the original release but it is compressed, muffled and clipped. There is a lot less clarity and separation between the voices and instruments (the drums are a mess). It seems the engineers jut compressed the hell out of the original master tape. I did an AB comparasion with my two players (one of them a HDCD machine) and the results were not what I expected.This applies to the original Europe 72 material. The extra tracks are better, but apart from an excellent ""Looks Like Rain"", it is all Pigpen howling, and that is my least favorite GD music.I bought the ""Live Dead"" remaster at the same time and it has the same problem.Stick with your Warner versions if you still have them!"
5,Love it,"This purchase was to replace an old, long-lost copy. I've always liked their studio-produced stuff, much to the chagrin of some more serious aficionados. Every once in a while it's nice to hear a nice crisp rendition than to have to pore over tons of bootlegs to find just the one. There are some really good renditions on this 2-disc set. For me, He's Gone and B.E. Women were killer."
3,Could be better,"It's a good cd; but feel deceived as title is Europe '72 I expected it to be a ""live "" cd, and found out it was recorded in a S.F. warehouse!!"
5,Grateful Dead at their peak.,"This is a superb album that showcases the Grateful Dead's 1972 European tour, the last recordings of Pigpen McKernan, and the first album with the Godchauxs. 1972 was one of the Grateful Dead's best years and these recordings show it. There are signiture Dead songs such as Sugar Magnolia, Truckin', Awesome jam that follows, about an hour of Pigpen on the extended rerelease, and much more. This is a great intro to the Grateful Dead which was the greatest band to ever assemble. This is highly recomended to any Grateful Dead fan and if you are a Deadhead, you probably own it. This album is part of the trio of the Grateful Dead's best albums which were, Live/Dead(1969), Grateful Dead-usually referred to as simply Skull & Roses(1971), and this classic. Europe '72 is just an excellant album which proves that the Grateful Dead was the greatest."
5,Excellent Cleaner Wax for most painted surfaces,"Don't let the name fool you, this is a strong cleaner wax with a very very very mild polish. Does an excellent job of cleaning up oxidation but won't do much for swirls. Not only for Boats/RVs, works great on cars too. Makes the surface very slick and has great durability. You will easily get 3 months of beading on a car parked outside 24/7, possibly up to 6 months depending on climate. Overall a fantastic product. Top with DG Aquawax for increased durability and even better looks.Pros:-Great cleaner-Durable protection-Nice shine-Doesn't appear to stain trim if wiped off quickly-A little goes a long wayCons:-Not much polishing ability, very mild abrasive package."
1,NOT THE ONE I WAS LOOKING FOR,MY FAULT THIS ONE I GAVE IT AWAY IT'S THE THE MOVIE I THOUGHT IT WAS.SO IT'S MY FAULT AND I DID NOT WATCH IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH.
3,a bit scratchy,"I found this color to be light blue; seams are single-stitch (nothing fancy) but have held up so far. I've washed them only in cold water and cool dry; the last set I bought from this company (slightly different make, as it had a double stitch line) shrunk the seamline thread so it puckered on any seams. The other set feels softer as well; the moonstone set has been washed 3 times and is still a bit scratchy, although they are softening a little - just not sure how much softer they'll get. Paid $36 for them."
1,Terrible quality!,The quality of this set of sheet is terrible!!! Both the flat and fitted sheets pile and they felt like sand paper after the first time I used them. This is not the quality you hope to get with 500 thread count sheets... Very disapointed!!! Do not buy them!!!
3,Color Color Color,"I ordered these sheets based off the reviews it got. I really wanted light blue as it would go with the rest of the bedding I already had. Imagine my surprise when I opened the package and found lavender sheets!!! This are not light blue, no way, no how. Lavender, not blue!!! I was so disappointed. The sheets themselves are nice and soft, so my younger sister tells me, since she loves them and the color works for her. Moonstone... next time, please just say the color, no need to make up a weird or fancy name."
4,Very Satisfied Customer!,I love these sheets. They are very comfortable and so far very durable. I am sure they'll last a long time. Awesome price too!
1,picture not accurate,the photo looks great. Too bad what i got had slivered almonds - not a single whole almond in the box!don't waste your money. the picture looks NOTHING like what they send. They should have to put up a photo of what it really looks like. they wouldn't sell any!!!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED and feel cheated
5,Soul Alive by Solomon Burke,"Solomon Burke was new to me, however, once heard he is a favorite, this CD is fabulous as are all the others he's done. Proud Mary is a must for all fans."
5,This is an awesome book!!,"Last summer we had the privilege of having Neil Smith come and visit our small town for vacation bible school. We ordered the books, to have him sign them, not really knowing much about the book. After meeting him, I am more than impressed by his story. Once the book was read to my six year old, my thoughts about him and his book have gone up even a higher notch. If you have a child who is struggling with school or life, this is a great book about being able to overcome your weaknesses. Neil struggled with school and family issues, but did not let that stop him from becoming a great player and a good man. I was there for the signing, and Neil gave every child and adult his full attention, and was as nice to the first as he was to the two hundredth person he signed for. I only meet him that one time, but he made such a lasting impression. I would recommend this book to all ages especially if you are a Broncos or KC Chief fan!!!"
1,Bad delivery,"I bought this watch for a girl obvious red, the invoice said red, but the watch I receive is black...no comments"
3,Could be better,"I got this as a current update in respiratory therapy since I have been out of the field for a few years. There is a lot of good information in it; but, beware of the amount of outdated material. For example, does anyone still wait until a ventilator patient is on 60% before they add PEEP? It's not an altogether waste of time and money; but, it does need some serious updating."
1,Garbage full of errors,"Information given in a mathmatical style, full of errors.Internet content is also full of errors and is lacking.Garbage"
2,Cheap Chinese Plastic,Anything more than 99 cents for this product is a rip off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Cheap chinese plastic. Your Ipod could fall off anytime..BUYER BEWARE!!!!
3,"Basic, but cute.","It's mostly common sense, repetitive but if you are really into dogs you might find it cute."
4,THIS is the bikini kill album to buy!,"This cd is the best bikini kill put out. If you've never bought a b.k. cd, start with this one. I love it. The songs (all exept two) have an awesome beat and they'll make you want to sing-along and/or jump about. The album's a little short, but sooo worth the money. Unfortunatley, bikini kill has broken up, and this was their last cd (not counting the singles collection). However, it was by far their best. My favorite tracks are bloody ice-cream, tony randall, and reject all american. Excellent music- if you like punk rock i think you might like this too, cuz it's definitely punk rockin'."
4,Mash Patato Lover Beware,I bought this so I could make my sweeties favorate side dish; mash patataos. I like the easy compfortable grip and quick clean up of this item. There is nothing like fresh mash potatos; in my opinion.It makes mashing patatoes quite easy and enjoyable. I also us it to mash other items for soups and sauses. I keep it very handy so when needed.Enjoy
3,Just ok-,Honestly I thought ok I'll pay a bit more and it will be so nice. Not true my old cheap one works just as good IMO. Although the handle is really nice.
2,"It'll mash 'em, but then it'll rust.","I bought this here masher about two months ago, and I've been eating mashed potatoes every day, so its gotten some good use. However, I've found that with such frequent use, the masher is getting a bit mis-shapen. It also started to rust after a few cycles in the washing machine, which was unexpected! Not sure if I'm doing something wrong or what, but I was pretty disappointed in this masher. I'd definitely invest in a better masher in the future!"
3,it's ok,"It did the job, but takes more time to to mash up potatoes than my old Tupperware masher. Wish I bought the new Oxo masher, that has a flat grill surface, I think it would do a better job.I like to use this because it feels good, solid when mashing. Like all Oxo products, I think its because of the good-sized, soft handle, and sturdy construction."
5,Mash those potatoes!,"This is a fine potato masher. I am partial to a lot of the OXO kitchen implements. This was a decent price, but to be honest, the reason I ordered this from Amazon was to take advantage of the ""Buy Three, Get Four Free"" offer. I have used this offer several times, and it makes it well worthwhile to order four items and get the least expensive free. I LOVE AMAZON!"
5,What more can be said,"It mashes potatoes as well we anything else that can be masked like turnips, carrots, egg plant, etc. The best aspect is the handle, as all Oxo Good Grips it it very comfortable and it is ideal for anyone like myself who suffers from RMS (repetitive motion syndrome)."
5,OXO Potato masher - GREAT,"This masher is very good. It's very durable and simple to use. I use to use a spoon to mash potatoes and it hurt and took forever. With this, it takes me less than 3 minutes to mash it. The grip is fantastic and so is the stainless steel wires."
5,FORGET THE CRITICS THIS ALBUM ROCKS!,"This album is pure ROCK N ROLL! A must have, crank loud album. Lita Ford is truely the QUEEN OF NOISE. Not Courtney, not that chick from Garabage, not even Joan! I can't wait for the new album from Ms. Ford! If you don't own this album, get up and go to your local music store and buy it!"
4,Lovely Lita Can play!!,"Lita Ford is my favorite metal chick off all time. Not only can she sing and play a mean guitar she a very atrractive looking lady! Seriously, can it get any better than that?This cd is her best release as far as I'm concerned and it's a must have for any hard rock/metal fan who likes that 80's metal stuff!You rock Lita!!"
4,** Not quite as good as some of his other titles **,This was the third Goddard title I read .. & I was a little disappointed. I wouldn't recommend reading this title first .. try (say) In Pale Batallions or Hand In Glove first. I've given it 4 stars because the writing/language is still superb Goddard. I deducted one star only because (personally) I found the ending a little far-fetched.
3,Good for a long journey,"Two con men try their luck at seducing an heiress in the hope that her father will buy the lucky one off, only to find that they are the prey rather than the predators. Intricate plotting saves the book, as the characters are all such scumbags it's difficult to care what happens to them."
2,I bought two of these phone chargers.s,One was fine and is still working great. The other one didn't even work for one month. :(
2,"Ahh, nothing much to say.","I liked the first ""so little time"" tape. In this one I barly laughed. The stories just reapeated themselves. Im not saying I dont like the twins, but the script was alittle lame this time."
5,FANatic OverLook,I think that this is a great idea! I am a HUGE FANatic of the Olsen Twins and I'm always trying to tape the shows on tapes just so I have them on hand but having them on a DVD is so handy. You can just click and go instead of pushing fastforward a hundred times and rewind the same! It's great that they are allowing for their fans to see extra stuff too! Sometimes you just can't get enough *smiles*. I highly recommend purchasing this item if you are a fan of Mary-Kate and Ashley or just enjoy the show SO LITTLE TIME.
2,Quite Poor,"Very amateur printing and binding. Much of the information is repeated several times over verbatim... feels very much like the book was padded out to its length.The ""for computer people"" angle is a red herring. The author simply comments - repeatedly - on the similarity between exploiting flaws in locks and exploiting flaws in computer security protocols. This is never explored or elaborated upon, nor is lock picking explored from a particularly computerish angle.The information presented in the book is fairly clear, but there's very little of it. Furthermore, all of the information in the book is freely available - and better written - in several online guides.Overall, I'm quite disappointed. Not worth the money."
4,"A Unique Title,","This is not your average lockpicking tutorial and you'll find it to be useless unless you have a particular mindset. Written for the ""computer hacker"", Steel Bolt Hacking is a title meant for people with a curious mind who want to learn to pick locks for sport and fun, not nessicarilly for profit or occupation. This title approaches the subject from that of a computer user, drawing conclusions and connections that today's avid computer user can both understand and apply to practice."
1,Dreadful stuff,"A dreadful book. Full of mispellings, technical confusion and repetition. This book 'might' show you how to pick your first simple tumbler lock, but the MIT guide is a better bet for both newbies and seasoned lock pickers - at least the MIT guide goes into more detail about tensioning which is critical for any successful pick.Save your money on this amateur publication and download the free MIT guide.And the guy that wrote the book isn't even a lock smith!"
5,Last time I order from anyone else,"These boards were used for our karate test in October for kids ages 3-7 years old. They worked great! Normally when I order from my other suppliers, one or two boards are broken and it kinda irritates me, but no broken boards here. Next exam I'm gonna try the thicker sizes too and will probably end up making this a routine thing for our school. Price is the main reason as these guys have the lowest around. Thanks Tiger!!!"
5,Great condition,Book came in awesome condition and on time! It was a little pricey but I was in an emergency situation. Nonetheless I appreciate the speed in which it was delivered. Good book as well
1,She's a shrew!,"SC sings the ballad(?) ""Just one last dance"" with such an artificial voice that you just have to throw up listening to it.The song ""Daddy's eyes"" is about her first baby, but the lyrics are written by someone else so that proofs Sarah Connor being unprofessional."
4,Black Taylor Hammer,This hammer is well built. It is completely black. My only complaint is that it is very smelly. (strong chemical odor from paint covering)
5,It Works!,"I'm no doctor, but this thing works! I use it for useless measures to make sure everything is going well with my health. The only minor problem is it seems too rubbery. When I go to the doctors, their's seems harder and easier to hit the nerve. Great for the price."
3,Actual product was not what was pictured,"Seller was great, timely delivery. The reflex hammer in the picture has a pin that holds the red rubber part in place. The reflex hammer that we received did not have the pin. We specifically ordered this to have the pin there to hold in place. Other wise the reflex hammer is good quality, just not what I thought I was ordering."
3,Color is misleading.,"The picture, along with the ""dark green"" description is misleading. It's very bright green. Also, the Babinski tip is very sharp - must use a delicate touch."
2,Cheap product,"Good as a back-up but the head is flimsy cheap rubber. Poor craftsmanship. There's a fringe from the mold that is annoying. The rubber is textured, not smooth. I don't like the weight balance. It is too light."
1,Very poor quality,It didn't illicit any kind of reflex ...it needs to be heavier ... also the attending asked me to bring another one ...
2,Not like the picture,"It's a reflex hammer, but it's not like the picture, It is a textured rubber and the colors don't match at all."
4,Another interesting book of photos from archives,"A nice compilation of generally unpublished photos from various company and other archives. This book is in a larger format, approximately magazine size, than the similar publications from Arcadia. Unfortunately, the reproduction in this Dover book is not quite as good as similar Arcadia publications. Some photos are somewhat muddy; others have been copied from company publications and the screen detracts from the picture quality. Overall, though, an enjoyable collection and worth the price. The commentary tends to be sketchy in places but is generally well researched."
5,"blues piano artistry, indeed","In 1961, the great Meade 'Lux' Lewis entered the studio with producer Chris Albertson to record this masterpiece of blues and boogie woogie piano. It's nothing short of a true wonder to hear Lewis on a grand piano, with superb sound quality, tickling and pounding the keys, playing strikingly modern-sounding music. For some strange reason, Lewis was considered something of a has-been at the time, but now, almost 43 years later, the music sounds as if it was recorded only yesterday. The grooves never quit, and harmonically, Lewis pulls a few amazing stunts. He also plays the celeste on three tracks, which has often been sneered at by critics, but the music-box effect is surprisingly beautiful, and somehow it all fits in very nicely. If you only want to buy one blues piano cd in your lifetime, this one is not at all a bad choice."
4,"""Hey, OXO! Great job, again!""","OXO products are WONDERFUL - my kitchen is full of their utensils! This peeler/parer set is great, especially a great gift for a shower gift or house warming present (I know it sounds silly, but I've done it and they were the hit of the party!). This cost is EXTREMLY good, too. You won't find such comfortable, reliable, stylish cookware for such a great price. Obviously, I highly recommend!"
3,Not so great unless you have needs for this type of handle,"I had both of these pieces. I have kept the peeler and I like it. It's not the best peeler in the universe, but it does the job well and is easy to use. It easily goes through the dishwasher without problems.I HATE the paring knife. I personally found the handle to be uncomfortable and unwieldy. It was just too big.Why do I like the handle on the peeler and not the knife? I have a feeling it's because of the difference in how you hold it when you complete each task. It's not as bothersome with the peeler. And, at least on mine, the peeler had a slightly more oval and flat shape to the handle then the parer seemed to... at least to me.*** Now I do know people with Rheumatoid Arthritis for whom this is an AWESOME set because of the size and comfort grip. So please, keep in mind if you have this sort of problem it may be a very wonderful set for you. I would definitely give it a try for the price. ***"
2,"OK peeler, junk parer","Both of these items seem ""cheap"" and not up to OXO quality. The peeler is just passable but the parer was not only dull right out of the package, but immediately rusted and discolored. Not only that, an email to OXO regarding their ""satisfaction guarantee"" has been unanswered for over a month! Dents my faith in OXO!"
3,Average...,"I typically like OXO products. However, the handles on these items are too large. I also found I couldn't peel things as quickly as with other peelers. If you don't mind a large handle & aren't concerned about speed, these are great utensils."
4,One Heck of a Kitchen Set...Just Avoid the Diswasher!,"I bought this set when I first moved into my apartment, as I've been a fan of the Good Grips products for a while now. This set is absolutely indespensible, as I use these tools almost every day.Peeler: This is wonderful for peeling potatoes, as the easy-to-grip handle and swivel blade help you to comfortably maneuver around bumpy and slippery surfaces.Knife: Since purchasing the set 4 months ago, my knife has stayed incredibly sharp and is able to cut through everything from crunchy carrots to smooshy tomatoes.Here's why the set didn't get the ""5"" rating: The pair should be hand washed and *not* put in the dishwasher. The knife got a tad rusty after running it through a cycle. Note: This was easy to correct with a Brillo pad and a little elbow grease.However, I don't think you should let this ""diswasher drama"" sway you from purchasing this set, as the benefits *far* outweigh the limitations."
3,Peeler/Parer Set,"I love the peeler, which is why I bought it to begin with, but the parer rusted the first time I put it in the dishwasher. The peeler did not. Although if you know anything about knives then you know that you aren't supposed wash them in the dishwasher. But I have done it for years, and it's almost like a test to see how great they actually are. They are both very sharp."
2,not for small hands,"This is a fine peeler for many people - the blade is nice and sharp, and it cuts well - but the handle is so fat that it tires my hand almost immediately. Not a good grip!!!"
3,The grip that bends,"I, too, was on the search for a 3-tined fork and was initially delighted when I found this one. My mother's antique cooking forks being the standard, however, I was disappointed in the OXO fork's tines. While the tool is the right length, the soft grip a plus, and the tines reasonably thin (though not thin enough to meet the standard), if your work requires a firm grip, the tines will likely bend. They just can't handle any weight or force. If you don't mind bending the tines back into shape on occasion, or if your expected use is lightweight, this fork will do."
3,Giant Brains -- Oh WOW!,"This popularization may be of interest to historians of technology or cultural historians. It was even given away at the time of publication by the IBM Federal Division sales force (properly encased in a nice leatherette cover) to introduce government bureaucrats to applications for IBM's new products. For a more scholarly approach, look at Greenberger's contemporaneous ""Computers and the world of the future""."
2,GREAT FOR KARAOKE,"I was really excited to see all of the hits from the 90's on 1 CD. But the 60 Greatest 90's Dance Hits was not what I expected. Once I opened and began to play it, I realized the artist are not the original artist. The songs sound horrible. Very disappointed and to boot Amazon on returned less than half of what I paid, because I opened it. I wish they would CLEARLY mark that the original singers are not on the CD. Even though I still love AMAZON, I don't think I will buy another compilation CD."
1,TOTALLY MISLEADING - VERY DISAPPOINTED,"It says Various Artists in the ad, so I expected the Original music like you'd get with a ""Now that's what I call music"" type CD. It appears all the songs are re-done by band, ""THE HIT CREW"", which it says NOWHERE in the display, and who I've never heard of.If you want to waste your money on ""THE HIT CREW"" go ahead and spend your money on this, if you want the original songs, don't bother."
3,Crushingly Powerful,"Amon Amarth crash through the beerier of the current millennium with power and aggression. As a fan of more recent albums I was stoked to find this, their third release, on Amazon.com. It delivers with a slightly more aggressive sound than Versus the World and later albums. It is not a drastic difference though as they seem to tweak themselves only slightly between each record so as not to have a carbon copy of a past album, yet not lose any fans. I dig this album, and it has the guitar sound I have come to know and love by this mountain of doom."
1,From a Dedicated BJ Fan,"Avoid this book like the plague. I read and reread this book several times. I play at my local casino (SD,H17, DD on 10-11) 60% penetration, No insurance. I practised day and night. I raised my bets when counts were positive and believe me when I say this that the dealer one each and every time. Looks like this book was written to knockout the players instead of the dealers. My 2 bits stay away from this book and avoid doing what the authors say at all costs. Remember high cards are very likely to favor the dealer as well so dont buy the one sided logic which this book perpetuates.Good luck"
4,"It works, plain and simple.","This book is simpler but works as well as other books for two reasons. You don't have to do multiple calculations to get a true count and it offers great advice for disguising your card counting techniques. I won $2,000 the first time out of the gate using this method."
3,Good but could have been better,This book did seem good at first nice charts ect ectIt talked about the KO system and the KO preferred systemThe KO preferred system is the KO system with abt 18-22 rule changes for certain situations eg hit on a 16 V a 10 unless the count is above -4The KO system is an unbalanced system in itself making it much eraser to count then the slandered HI-LO system used by most players today.What the book didn't do for me was compare the differences of the HI LO system and rely show me that it can preform as equally sure you can say this statistic means it works as well but why does it work as closely?IT Was a good one to learn basics of KO But it did not truly convince me how effective it is!!!! and that is what i really wanted to learn about the KO system
1,Out Dated and Stale,"While the KO system gives players a slight advantage, this book neglects the fact that you will only win with counting if you play A LOT. With how much you have to play to make a profit, why stick with an old and oversimplified system? For only a few more hours of work you can learn a level two system and make way more money. The KO system is the easy way out and pays accordingly. Most of this information can be found online anyways. If you are serious about making money counting, leave this count behind and pick up a book with a level two system."
3,good book,good book that did help me play blackjack a lot better. some good strageides on playing the game and did help my improve my game a lot.
4,A Classic western!,"Two momentous things happened to Lee Purdy, dreamer and owner of a ranch in New Mexico called The Enchanted Hill. Bud Shannon, a total stranger, took a long shot at him with a rifle and later at a desert railroad stop, Lee met the loveliest woman he had ever laid eyes on. With the aid of a quick brain and an iron nerve, he managed to escape Bud, but his heart was no match for the woman Gail Ormsby!"
5,Really Came Through,"During the power outage we just experienced (8/14/03) I pulled out four flashlights. This one was in my nighttable since I don't know when. It was the only one that went on. I even changed the batteries in two of the others, and nothing. But with this little flashlight I read by it, walked by it, etc., Great little clear bright light. Then I was able to borrow another flashlight which turned out to be Duracell's larger flashlight--that was great, too. Am stocking up for every room in the house."
5,A Must Have for your library,"I've been struggling with PPTP and FreeS/WAN for years now and the hardest task I now have to deal with is teaching others the intricate nature of VPN's, tunneling, masq'ing connections and linking private LANs together. This book has been an excellent resource to intruct others on how to administer our tangle of connections and taught me a few nifty tricks in the process."
2,I am so disapointed,I don't know what is hapening with this people...I buy this book based in that reviews (all 5 stars) and when I open the book I am totaly disapointed. About the book: The examples is not complete and the text is confused. I do not recomend.
2,Not that great,The soap is not a very good lathering soap and after a while it seems to have lost its smell
5,Great,Smells nice and strong. Last a long time. Lathers good. Bought the sandalwood soap also and loved it too. Great product.
1,Shape,The ad said oblong not oblong/rectangular so I was not happy.I wonted oblong. I will make it work somehow.
3,Can't get the wrinkles out,"It's a pretty tablecloth and I would like it if I could get the wrinkles out. The tablecloth came out of the package deeply creased and wrinkled so I washed and dried it, hoping it would come out looking better. I thought, since it is a cotton/polyester blend, that it would come out of the dryer pretty smooth, maybe need a touchup, as another reviewer said. The label instructions call for cold water wash and drying with no heat. Still deeply creased and wrinkled. I couldn't put it on the table looking like that so I tried to iron it without much success. I'm going to take it to a dry cleaner and see if they can get it smooth. Disappointing for being a Lenox tablecloth."
1,please send what I ordered,This is the 2nd time I have tried to order the regular 60x104 inch tablecloth. They keep sending me the 60x104 inch OBLONG tablecloth.Can someone tell me how to actually get what I ordered????
1,Opinion of the product,"Never receipt neither the order, nor the tablecloth nor the napkins. Very irresponsible the sr, blaming me to my of having misled the package. I demand my complete return of my money!!"
5,Beautiful!,Beautiful table cloth. I ordered the 70 inch round cloth just to decorate a small table. This table cloth would go with most table top Christmas decor. The red is not bright as someone mentioned in another review. Beautiful nonetheless!
5,tablecloth,This was far more beautiful than I imagined by the picture. It is very nice quality fabric and washes up easily. No ironing!
4,Good buy,"This tablecloth was prettier than pictured, good quality material. Purchased for a family holiday dinner. My grandson spilled a glass containing red wine on it on it's first use. I was able to get the stain out and it washed up beautifully"
2,Disappointed,"I thought that the quality was very poor with many flaws in the material; also, not a true oval shape-corners are rounded, but ends are straight and not rounded; should have returned, but didn't take the time"
2,"Lenox 70"" round tablecloth",I am disappointed with this beautiful tablecloth because it has so much polyester in it that it slides all over the table! When I ordered it the price was right and it is very beautiful. It washes out nicely and does not need ironing but with big kids around (my husband) it is just too slippery!
5,Ronald,"This tablecloth was a beautiful addition to our kitchen holiday decor.It was a very well made, quality item."
5,Lennox Holiday Tablecloth,So glad I could replace my old tablecloth at a reasonable price! I absolutely love this print!! I especially am grateful to have found it in a oval size which is much harder to do!
5,beautiful,"It's better than expected. Beautiful, elegant, soft. I love this. You can use it for any occasion, holiday, or normal days. It adds some art in your room."
4,Rocked out slide guitar from Ex-Revelators Schooley,"I saw them live and John Schooley blew me away with his slide guitars riffs, ranging from rocked out blues to sped up garage rock. Hating to compare, but this is in the same vien as his former band the Revelators, and has that Oblivians,White Stripes, and even Jon Spencer (but much cooler) kind of sound. So if you are into blues, slide guitar, punk and garage, you will most likely dig this great addition on Sympathy."
2,50% live,"My issue with this is that just like Europe '72, it's been polished up post-production. There are over-dubbed harmonies, studio mastered mixing and the careful removal of mess-ups. Just listen the version of 'Wharf Rat' (my favorite Dead song ever). There are layered tracks of Jerry's voice singing perfect harmonies. What made the Dead great was that they were far from perfect (not including most performances the year 1977) and their imperfections made them one of the last honest and improvisational rock bands out there. If you want real live Dead, stick to Dick's Picks and other new live releases."
4,Great live album,"If you are a Deadhead then you'll love it, especially Bertha, it's an immaculate performance. Some may find the middle of the album a bit slow and excessive on the drum solos, but this leads into some great stuff. A purchase that has been well appreciated and great value for money. If you want a strong bluesy jamming album, I'd suggest Fillmore East over this one."
4,"Not Quite ""All-Stars""","I thought this CD was out-of-print in the U.S., but Charlie Mariano's ""Boston All-Stars"" has reemerged recently thanks to the British ""Collectors Choice"" series (of which this is number 29 of 50). According to a promotional sticker on the cover, this disc is an apparent all-star selection of critic Richard Cook (of Penguin Guide fame -- though he only gave it three stars in my edition). With all due respect, when I think of Boston all-stars, it's a different kind of Bird that comes to mind, as in Larry, not a second tier jazz player like Mariano. However, these two Prestige 10""s do show that great early 50s jazz wasn't confined to New York on the East Coast. In my opinion, the players who give the best all-star performance are the trumpeters, Joe Gordon and Herb Pomeroy, though Mariano isn't far behind. Overall, this is a good session for OJC fans, but by no means essential -- 3 1/2 stars for content, rounded up to 4 since it is now more widely available."
4,A Simple Masterpiece!,"All musical lovers must have this cd in their collection to hear and see. This cd is like well better than the musicals now and before. Even though I am not amazed of the sound quality, and it could be better, and some of the verses missing in Oom-Pa-Pah, It is truly a delightful cd to listen as each song tells the story of life, romance, hope, and trust, and making a classic tale come to life. If you are a real fan of Dicken's, than you will be OVERWHELMED in this musical. Please suport a musical that is still in life from years to come before it is gone. As you see, the cd is becoming rare and so is the movie, you will want to buy this classic before time runs out. So go out and buy it! :)"
3,let oliver sing!,"On the whole, this is a fine soundtrack to a glorious film. But the voice of Oliver is so terrible, so pathetic and weak, that it undermines the entire soundtrack. The big production numbers are great, the Artful dodger and Fagin are fab, then in comes whimpering little Oliver and I cringe. By all means, buy Oliver!, but buy the original London cast album!!"
5,It's shop vac,"What can I say, it works, it fits and it was the missing attachment for my 16 year old vaccuum."
4,Works Fine For Household Use,"Product is good gauge plastic. Good for household and garage use. I wanted to use it to vacuum my car, but the crevices in the car are more narrow than the tool."
1,Awesome Gadget,"This thing scoops out rock hard ice cream so easily. I've gone through many ice cream scoopers and I stuggled with all of them. Yes, it is more like a slab of ice cream than a scoop, but if it's going in a bowl and not a cone, then so what. No more letting the ice cream sit out for 10 minutes.*UPDATE*I should have updated this a while ago, as I threw this thing out a long time ago. It's coated in some non-stick material that I noticed flakes of in my ice cream. Since it's only used for ice cream, I can't imagine what caused it to flake off. It never goes in the dishwasher, either. I still love the design, but I'm not interested in eating teflon, or whatever they use to coat this. One star, not five!"
2,Stick with a scoop,"Although it's easy to dig into ice cream with this spade, the result is more like a slab of ice cream than a scoop. Overall, a traditional ice cream scoop is easier to use. I would suggest the OXO Good Grips nonstick ice cream scoop instead."
2,fun at times but ....well stupid,"Sure this album presents a reason for you to bob your head. It allows you to have fun. but on the other hand the lyrics are so bad that i feel dumb for tuning in. While many view the uk subs as punk pioneers i feel they are in all essense just another band. The album drones on for what seems like hours, and is so rendundant that i find it hard to distinguish one song from the next. There are maybe a few fun spots such as ""cid"", or ""new york state police but other than that the hub bub is wrong."
4,Val Kilmer Pulls A Rabbit Out Of The Hat,"In the first three minutes of this film, Val Kilmer tells you not to judge him until you have viewed his life (this film). This film begins rather depressingly with several druggie losers and multiple large body tattoos and the worst narcotics -- and our druggie loser Val Kilmer trapped in a fire. A film that begins this low, this fatal, how could it get better? How can we root for such a pathetic loser? Hang in there! You will be surprised at the ending. Really surprised. Next to ""Tombstone"", one of Val's best. Did I mention, you will be surprised at the ending?"
5,The Salton Sea,I really enjoyed this flick. I see way too many movies and i must say this is one of the better ones out there today. Val Kilmer is excellent as a druggy and the whole way he deals with things and the way the movie is played out is definatly choice!Later!
4,surprisingly good movie,"i had wanted to see it when it was in theaters but it wasn't out for very long and a few people had told me that it sucked. but i was surprised at how visually cool and artfully directed the salton sea was. val kilmer is a great actor who is overlooked alot, as other reviewers have mentioned. he gives a good performance which causes his character to subtly grow on you. and the supporting actors were interestingly cast. overall, i liked the movie, definitely worth seeing!"
4,www.sportofdistraction.com,"Excellence in story-writing. The script is elusive and well-structured; and the performances were precise.The story is the strength of this film---which is accompanied by the examination of the soul which takes place throughout. Val Kilmer's predicament, which is not completely shown at the beginning of the movie but in retrospect undoubtedly sets the stage for the entire film, is gut-wrenching.I can't express enough the level to which I enjoyed the combination of Kilmer/D'Onofrio/etc...'s performances and the script."
1,just avoid it!,"JUST HOW AMAZING THAT VAL KILMER CAN ALWAYS FINDS HIS WAY INTO LOUSY MOVIES,NOW HE DOES IT AGAIN!"
1,Didn't like the film,"I could not recommend this film. It glamorizes the life of a ""tweaker"". The acting is very good, but the subject matter is depressing."
2,Ack.,"When I first read a review about The Salton Sea, I couldn't wait to see it. I was disapointed when I head the movie had been dropped from numerous theatres after only a few short weeks. Now I know why. This movie could've been so much better. Kilmer is a bore as usual. Uninteresting characters, and the usual, ""widowed husband seeks revenge"" plotline make this film one of the worst of 2002. How anyone could take an interesting plot subject such as meth cookers, and the underground methadone trade, and make it completely dull and boring is beyond me. The only reason I gave The Salton Sea two stars instead of one,is because of D'Onofrios' performance as a noseless meth dealer. Which, as far as D'Onfrio performances go, was lackluster at best."
5,My boys,"Two of my former employees are now writing films. The first was Joe Gayton for UNCOMMON VALOR. Now his brother Tony had the Salton Sea and Murder by Numbers. They worked for The Hollywood Star newspaper, filling the newsracks in Hollywood as they attended USC studying film. Both are ambitious and have become quite successful. Makes me feel good about them."
5,3.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Artfully constructed, splendidly acted (especially in a career-best turn by D'Onofrio as the inimitable ""Pooh Bear"") and consistently engaging, The Salton Sea is a neo-noir that might have made the originals proud."
5,Good movie!,My husband saw part of this movie on tv some time ago and asked if I could find it somewhere online because our local movie store couldn't get it. It was a pretty good movie. It deals with a drug dealer/user/under cover and it was pretty good.
3,the gritty salty underbelly of LA's drug traffic,"The sad story of a trumpet player caught up in a web of liesof his own making.He has a Mexican drug ring, his wife's parents, two sheriff's narcsand the FBI all watching his every move,while he tries to set up the guys who killed his wife.The end is sort of unexpected and I liked that,but the LA / southern California drug ( meth) scene isnothing but black on black with murder and insanitymixed in: the story of an LA rat turns into a renewal of faith?"
5,Salton Sea Review,"A great film with Val Kilmer and really an all star cast. A gritty, sometimes hard to watch story about the speed subculture and well played out revenge plot. This movie ay not be for everyone, but is well made, acted, and directed. Probably the best part I have seen played by Vincent D'Onofrio as Poo Bear, a dangerous gacked out drug dealer that does not trust anyone."
2,Salton Sea: All Wet,"Equal parts ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Memento"", ""The Salton Sea"" only reminds us of how artfully assembled those two films are. Val Kilmer does a fairly good job as a mysterious crystal meth addict with an agenda. But his charisma alone doesn't illuminate the character. And neither does this clumsy, stumbling screenplay, nor the film's beautifully shot images. Oh, and though Vincent D'Onofrio (one of my favorite actors) doesn't actually give a bad performance, he comes so close, it's almost painful to watch. Verdit: A half-hearted film noir pastiche."
1,Film School Garbage,"This movie was garbage. It was a pile of 'cool' camera shots, and 'cool' ideas for a film that were shoved into a plot. The best way to describe a movie like this is, ""I know let's throw a narrator in half way through the film!"" Ideas such as this is how I viewed the 'art' of this waste of celluloid.Brilliant.' let's take all the great ideas we have seen in film and want to do and use them all up on one first time film."" Fantastic.Rent this movie, don't buy it yet.try to watch the whole thing to see for yourself the mass quantaties of 'art' that was put into this film."
1,WORST MOVIE,"This movie is horrible. It's sloppy. The only good thing about this movie is that it looks good. Thats all. The movie tries to make the characters interesting, but they're actually quite boring. This movie is dark, but not edgy. It doesnt come close to pulp fiction so dont believe any reviews you read that say's it does. If you want something dark,and edgy then check out Requim For A Dream."
5,It's a Great Unknown!!,"To most people, this movie isnt well known. I bought it at Walmart years ago and still love it. I have let several friends borrow it and never got a bad review yet. Its the type of Val Kilmer movie we all love. Rent this movie!"
5,"A great looking, very well acted, grotesque masterpiece","'The Salton Sea' is perhaps one of the most underrated and under appreciated movies in recent years. Starring Val Kilmer as Danny Parker, or is it Tom Van Allen, is a beautifully made film revolving around the life of the tweaker and the drug world as a whole. As the film develops we have an insight into just who the Kilmer character really is, what he's doing in such a place and why he is here.Val Kilmer plays the damaged man in a world we're not completely sure he belongs in, to perfection. The supporting cast is equally stellar, especially that of Vincent donofrio who is completely unrecognisable in the role of 'Pooh Bear'.5-stars from me. This film shouldn't be missed. It's different, very different but you'll marvel at its beauty and the grotesque nature of the characters and environments you encounter.A wonderful film."
4,The Salton Sea,Starts off slow but makes up for it in the end. It is a really great story. Val Kilmer does a great job (as usual).
5,The Salton Sea,"Amazon, you need a sixth star to do full justice to this edgy, innovative masterpiece of ensemble acting. That lead actor Val Kilmer can shine so brilliantly amidst the endless stream of first rate supporting actors proves he is not only an actor of supreme ability, but a catalyst who has brought about small miracles in the roles of, among others, Sarsgaard, Wong, D'Onofrio, Plummer, Unger, Guzman --well the list is long and simply mind-boggling. The film was released in only four or five major cities and dropped. How the producers of this film could have been so dense in promoting it is beyond my scope of understanding. No doubt Kilmer will once again be passed over at Oscar time (remember Tombstone? The Doors? How about Heat?) but if making good films is his real source of satisfaction, he should be very proud of this film. His acting depicts a range of human emotions in this film that will leave you breathless.Do yourself a favor and see this movie. Often."
4,Not the best ive heard but still very good,"In keeping with normal Ferry Corsten quality this CD is excellent. There are of course better CDs in the world, but they are few and far between and you cant go wrong with this CD. I personally liked this one better than Trancemissions 01, but both are good. Enjoy! :)"
1,a good example of how bad trance can be,"Trance is way too broad of a term. People tend to call everything trance these days. So while I am browsing through ""trance"" singles trying to find some fresh tunes, I often come upon very bad music. This music is uninspired, overly-repetitive, migraine-inducing, and generally low quality. It gives trance a bad name. A bizarre region of glow-stick wearing ""trance-addicts"" are the only reason this music hasn't gone the way of the dinosaur. People like Ferry Corsten. Ugh. If you're looking for music that sounds ANYTHING like Sasha, Digweed, Oakenfold, or any other big name ""trance"" dj, you won't find it here. Skip this one."
3,Awesome vocal trance tunes...but bad quality...,"For those who love pretty trance and vocals, this volume gives you much more of that than we got in Global Trancemissions 1. The reason I'm only giving this disc 3 stars is because it is absolutely PLAGUED by pops and scratches in the vinyl Corsten used to create this mix. What a disappointment."
3,Preview songs before purchasing.,"I purchased the original back many years. ReOrdered for one song only. Originally a double album. The album is very MIles Davis of the late '70s and early '80s, which is guitar and basS oriented. on this album his trumpet sound is shrilled more than others. Not anyways like his early cool sounds. For length, you get your money's worth. If not familar, this avant garde, funk sounding jazz may have to be an acquired taste. CD was in excellent condition. (PURCHASED ""USED-VERY GOOD."")"
4,We want MORE Miles,"At first listen, I thought the album title was kind of a joke, or actually a literal request seeing as how Miles really doesn't play a lot on this album. However, Miles really knew WHEN to play, and when he does, he always hits the right notes. We want MILES! But we get Mike Stern, with amazing progressive guitar solos that really dominate the album.This is fusion all the way, and as others have said, you could buy this album just for Marcus Miller's stellar bass playing, but you could also buy this for some insane guitar work from Stern. Of course, Miles is great, and so is Minu Cinelu on the percussion. Different from most of Miles' catalog, but great music!"
5,Bloody Brilliant,"It was with the greatest pleasure that I finished this chapter in H.H.'s saga. As usual the writing and plot draw you on relentlessly page after page. Indeed, just the experience of reading of it can be compared to ""rounding the Horn""! With heroic battles, plots, delightful twists, sparkling prose and insightful humanity, the characters move from the frictional to flesh and blood. A truly satisfying read."
4,Shows great character development,"This book, despite the fact that most of it is not set at sea, provides excellent insight into Forester's great character, Horatio Hornblower. It is a pivotal book, and culminates the three-book series (Beat to Quarters, Ship of the Line, & Flying Colours) that make up the first introduction of HH by Forester. Time well spent!"
4,Hornblower wins again!,"This book continues the adventures of Horatio in to the Tropics. He has this great humility that comes across as hilariously funny, especially during times of crisis.The rlationship with his wife is detailed more in these stories which shows his more warm and human side.I feel like I would like him if I met him."
5,Best citrus knife ever,"This citrus knife is very easy to use. The blade is longer than most making it easy to segment the largest grapefruit with ease and the 'Good Grips' handle is, like all the company's products, very comfortable in the hand."
4,Insightful,"I wanted to learn sign language after reading this novel.Though I was forced to read it for English, and parts of it were squrim-worthy, I am glad I had the opportunity to study this novel. :)You will see things differently after you read this novel."
3,It has potential to be an excellent book!,"I enjoyed the book. The biggest reason I enjoyed ""The Raging Quiet"" is because it made me think about how sometimes one being must give something up that the person enjoys to save another's life. When I was reading it also made me think about how you should not give up on something you are doing and still try to accomplish it even if someone or something is hassling you. In some parts of the book I thought they were boring. For some of the parts I could sympathize and empathize for Marnie Isherwood, the main character. Like for example, when Isake died, I have had someone close to me be sick for a long time and then die. I recommend this book to readers who can appreciate the 1700's and how they had to live and people who can be patient. Erica Fawley"
5,The raging quiet.,"Sherryl Jordan has written a great book here about Marnie and Raver; two totally different people but yet they are similar. Marnie is a new comer to the town and Raven is deaf. Marnie and Raven make friends and soon they are communicating with a sign language. The villagers suspect her for witchcraft and for this they label them 'the village witch and the village madman'When Marnie gets put to a trial for witch craft will she prove innocent ? Or will they simply hang her?Read this story of friendship and love, hate and betrayal.This is an awesome book! Make sure you read it!"
4,Beautifully written!,This was one of the most haunting and beautifully written books I have read in a long time. Miss Jordan captured the medaeval setting wonderfully and she conveyed the attitude of the towns people perfectly. I finished it in one sitting! Sherryl Jordan comes across with a very important lesson. Love knows no bounds.
5,Very Briiliant!!,"This is a really really good book. Sixteen-year-old Marnie moves with her new and older husband to a small fishing village. When he dies suddenly, the villagers suspect her of killing him. Lonely, she befriends the village madman and discovers he is deaf, not insane. She invents a way of talking through her hands and the villagers try her for witchcraft. The words are really powerful and I really loved it."
2,Teen Girls Beware,"This book may be fine writing and may have great characters, but I was disappointed to find that in the first few pages, we see a young girl basically experiencing rape at the hands of her new ""husband"". My daughter is 12 years old, and perhaps the author thinks that 12 year olds are ready for this type of writing. The writing was explicit enough that it made my daughter uncomfortable. Parents, please pre-read this book to make sure that it is appropriate for your teen daughter."
5,This is the best book by Sherryl Jordan yet!!,"I love Sherryl Jordan's books, so when this one came out, I bought it. Once into the book, I couldn't stop. The book touched me, and since I bought it (about a month ago), I've read it four more times! I understood how Marnie felt when she had to marry for her family (not that I've had to do that!), and I loved when Raven nursed the injured rabbit back to health. All the characters- Marnie, Raven (Raver), and Father Brannan, made up a great story!"
3,Pleasant... not as good as the Secret,"If you love silly (in a good way), saccharine sweet, Mary Sue romances this a book you would enjoy. There's very little plot to the story and very little character development of minor characters. Our heroine disposition is very similar to Maria, (Julie Andrew's character from the Sound of Music). While our hero is the typical alpha male mold. Although not ""a keeper"". I did enjoy the story for what it was. I just wish that a better plot had been developed for it. A serial killer that struck no fear in my heart, deaths of characters I could barely remember and a demented general intent on forcing the Princess to marry him in order to secure the crown did nothing to enrich the story at all. I think people that love this book simply fell in love with the simple nature of Hero and Heroine."
1,Horrible writing - skip this one!,"For a novel presumably set in 1820, Garwood sure uses a lot of phrases that weren't used until 1920 - like ""yeah"" and ""sexy."" Regency gentlemen don't think someone is ""sexy."" Reading that just jars me entirely out of the story. Also, how about how he has her sit on his lap in front of visitors? Please, they would barely touch in company. Garwood obviously knows nothing about the period - and it shows. This is just terribly written. Skip and read something by Joanna Bourne or Loretta Chase!"
3,"Weak in spots, but worth your time","Okay, I won't get into the plot, because it's been done. I just read the Gift, and was just about through with Miss Garwood. Castles was a major improvement. Colin was stubborn enough to be interesting, but likeable and charming enough to make me root for him. He was sexy and powerful, yet his injury made him more human. All other Garwood heroes that I've read (except for Royce in The Prize) seem to be a little too close to perfect physically. Alesandra, our heroine, was a generic heroine who was too perfect to be real. The woman had no flaws, and that irritated me.The period was glamorized but nothing blatantly inaccurate jumped out at me (it was has to be pretty bad for me to care) so I was fine with it. The mystery was weak, and she should have just skipped it.Overall, nothing special, but it's worth your time, and you'll walk away entertained."
3,Castles is first rate Garwood!,"Princess Alesandra is exactly the gal to domesticate the work driven, suave confirmed bachelor, Colin. The suspenseful anticipation of their sensual saga is just why romance novels are loved.Be sure to read the entire series: 1. The Lion's Lady 2. The Guardian 3. The Gift 4. Castles"
3,Just Didn't Hold Up,"I gave this book 3 stars in deference to the author, who's usually great, and because the hero, Colin, is linked with other great characters from JG's books. I couldn't wait to read this, but it ended up being a little boring. There was nothing outstanding about it. The princess was a very good character, though. She had a lot of personality.If anyone who reads this book doesn't enjoy it, and hasn't read THE LION'S LADY, GUARDIAN ANGEL, and THE GIFT, don't despair. Those are fantastic!!"
3,"Good book, but not all that.","I did like this book, but I've read better. The story was great, but I guess the writing wasn't her greatest. I do plan to read it again because sometimes I might like the book more if I read it agian."
5,What an excellent sequel!,"I loved this book. I mean I loved, loved, LOVED this book! It was so great to get the update on Nathan and Sara and Jade and Caine and Colin, well all I can say is--WHAT A MAN! I loved him and Alesandra and the chemistry between them fizzled up the pages! The only thing missing from this series is possibly a love interest for Catherine!!!"
1,"quite poorly written, and not very interesting","This is the first Julie Garwood book I have ever read and I must say that I was quite appalled. The writing itself was not very good at all. Often the words were clumsily thrown together as though with no thought at all. There was extreme word overuse. The story was even worse. It is so unrealistic and unconvincing that the whole plot, or what could possibly be called a plot, is dull in the extreme. Alesandra is made out to be a rich, bumbling dullard while Colin is the suave and intelligent one who laughs at her mistakes. It makes me sick, because this is basically all the book is about. I do not recommend this as any sort of reading material, serious or just for fun."
2,No strong leading lady,"Being a big fan of Julie Garwood and having read Lyon's Lady and Guardian Angel I looked forward to reading about Colin. I was extremely disappointed. Whereas the female characters in the previous two novels, Jade and Christina were very strong and interesting - challenging the respective heros in the novels, Alesandra was rather weak and suffered from a rather nondescript personality. After the promising beginning showing her as a problem to the convent, I expected a bit of non conformity from her, but instead was given a non descript not fully realized, rather weak individual. I'm still a Garwood fan, but couldn't even finish Castles."
2,not worth the time of a long time fan,"This story greatly disappointed me. The character of Princess Alesander has great similarity with Christina from the book titled ""Lion's Lady"". Both make the hero confuse and make you laugh to read their act in trying to understanding the lady. It's fun for the first time fan. But not worth the time of a long time fan like me"
1,Worst novel...,"Absolutely hated this novel! I have read many good novels from Johanna Lindsley, Judith McNaught and Jude Deveraux. They all write with such grace that reading this made me feel like it was a novel I should have been reading as a teen. The whole book lacked description and feeling. Julie didn't quite bring you into the story because of the lack of these things. I can only hope for her sack that her other books are written better than this one."
3,its worth ur [price] i guess,"heres the thing, the book was really enchanting and everything! the main character needed some backbone...every other word to colin was ""do i displease u?"" and then garwood made colin into this arrogant one, i mean, really.....u should really seriously not read this book if u cant stand a woman not holding her own, i mean, it was really really frustrating! but im a romantic at heart, and this book did really capture romance so i guess it was worth [price], but, it definitely would not be my favorite... all in all, this was a pretty good book."
3,Yummy but unfilling....,"While Colin made me melt as I read this at 3:30 am ( I couldn't put it down) I found him to be a little irritating. While men are classically known for their stubbornness, Colin took it to a new degree. He seemed almost two faced... he didn't trust Alesandra with anything. However, they were an adorable couple. I wish Alesandra would have asserted more of that bed room behavior, she was a good dominator! I can't wait to read ""Guardian Angel"", because face it, Caine was sexy too :-) A good read, definately worth picking up!"
4,Another Garwood Classic,"As usual, Julie Garwood delivers. The romance, intrigue and humor usually found in her books is just as prevalent in this book, too. One can never go wrong purchasing a book by Julie Garwood if you're a fan of historical romance. The only drawback to this book, like all the others, is I can't put it down, and finish it much to quickly!!"
4,Castles (Crown's Spies),It was a bit mysterious at first but then it became a love story and also a who done it! Liked it a lot.
5,wonderful!,Julie Garwood has been my favorite author for about 15 years she has never disappointed me. Castles is my all time favotite book .This book is very well written. and historically accurate . A heart warming tale .
5,COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!!!,"I have read many of Julie Garwood's books, and this is one of my favorites (the Bride is my other). I thought the character's were well developed. I liked that Alesandra wasn't a wimp and was intelligent to boot. Colin's sense of humor was just perfect even though he wasn't. The book was a fast read, I couldn't put it down and read it in one night. There was not a lull at all in the story. This is a must read."
3,"okay, but not her best","Castles was the third Julie Garwood book that I read and I felt slightly let down halfway through. Colin seemed like a jerk throughout most of the book and all of a sudden, he does a complete 360 and becomes a loving husband. I usually like the picture the characters in my head as I read, but with Colin and Alesandra, I just couldn't see them in my mind. And the parts with the murderer's thoughts were just lame! Overall, the book was good, but not what I expected after The Secret and The Prize."
5,"Good from the start, but better with every listen","As a big fan of Richie's work, I was stoked to find that three of his import-only releases as well as this, his latest offering, were being released simultaneously. This album does take right off from where Bi-Polar Blues left off, however it has some of the same vibes evident from his ""What Is..."" and ""Wave of Emotion"" albums. From the first listen I was hooked on 'Some Voodoo' and the title cut, but the other songs prove to be equally great and enduring with multiple listens. 'The Feeling's Gone' and 'I'll be Around' are currently squaring off for my favorite tune on the album. This truly is a fantastic album by an incredible guitarist, who is not getting nearly the recognition he deserves! True, I sometimes miss the old shred-God Richie, but his song-writing gets better with every album."
4,Like woh...,"First off I gotta say damn... This album is tight as hell. Murs' flows and rhymes are just the shhh... The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because there are a few songs to skip, but almost all of them are tight. If you like Eminem's Slim Shady LP, you gotta listen to this, his flows and rhymes are just like Em's, and he tells stories just as good as Nas. If you don't buy it, at least listen to it, borrow it and burn it, whatever, just listen to it."
3,3 stars,"3 stars does not mean its a bad cd i just dont think this is worthy of 4 or 5 stars. There are a lot a good songs in this cd that dont quite fit next to one and other and dont give this cd that overall good album vibe, also there are alot of skibbable filler tracks which also let it down.Standout tracks""what do you know"" ""The night before"" ""Gods Work"" ""risky business"" and ""18\W a bullet"""
4,Useful.,I reviewed this before but now I have bought three of them because they are so nice in the hand. My daughter in law coveted mine so she gets the third as a Christmas present (not the only one!)
4,Insightful Insight from A Financial Sage,"By analyzing the essays Warren Buffet has written over the years, a reader can obtain a general, intuitive, though non-technical guide (for that Intelligent Investor) to Warren Buffet's investment method. Although appearing to be common-sensical in it's folksy mid-western prose, ""Essays"" explains in succinct and clear detail Buffet's fundamental analysis of businesses. Among these are a strict adherence to full disclosure of accounting transactions, the concept of economic goodwill, and confidence in conservative, factually confident and integrity filled management decisions. A solid, yet gap-filled introduction to Buffet's value-based investing principles."
1,If you really want to invest like Warren Buffett. . .,"you should not buy this collection of Warren Buffett's letters to investors. You should instead visit the Berkshire Hathaway website where all of these essays are available for free and invest the $22 in a good company following the principles outlined in these essays.If these essays were not so easily available, this collection would definitely be worth buying."
5,Excellent book on investing,"Buffett, the master investor, shares some keys to his success. Recommended for any investor."
5,Real Wisdom at a Good Price,"I work for a financial services company, and I'm subjected to corporate gobbledegook on a daily basis. Warren Buffett gets to the point. His explanations of financial transactions seem so effortless, I can't imagine how others get so confused and obtuse. Here's a mind worth delving in to, and this book lets you sit on the shoulder of a modern genius to see how he thinks. Good stuff."
5,Excellent insight,"Excellent comments from a man that proves Nice Guys do not finish last, they just keep going. Excellent ideas on creating capital the rational and humane way."
5,My favorite investment book,"I must've read this book at least 5 times and each time, I learned something new. Warren Buffett doesn't like to talk about stock picks nor has he write any type of investment book. However, this book is as close as it come to being Buffett's investment book [if he ever decide to write one]. His investing philosophy are sound and insightful. Best of all, this book is full of wit.Warning: it might be a little dense for beginners but once you understand the financial terms, you won't regret buying this book!"
2,Its Better You Just Download The Free Shareholder's Letter From Bershire's Website,"I bought this Book because I read in the reviews that the author organized the topics. But after reading it and reading the Shareholders letter, I learn more from the shareholders letter because it discusses with the decision in assessing companies. It book is helpful to those who doesn't have time to spend reading all the shareholders letter."
5,excellent,"These are the actual words penned by Buiffett. Not as dry as one would think, he's actually a wonderful writer. The Oracle of Omaha can turn a phrase and while parts of this are slow going, I enjoyed it throughly.I heartily recommend this book for those desiring wealth. I also strongly recommend The Millionaire Mind by Tom Stanley.The Millionaire Mind"
1,Not worth purchasing,"I made a mistake of not realizing that this CD only contained three tracks (two of which being different versions of the same song). Worse still, the songs weren't all that good - Ruslana's voice was over-powered by the overly-loud instrumentals, and there was no one distinctive flavor to her music (it sounded like she threw a bit of everything together: Ukrainian melodies, Latin rhythms, ""wanna-be"" tribal sounds, and English words). A rather strange combination, leaving one confused, to say the least."
5,Wild Dances,"Wild Dances~ Ruslana is an amazing album with fun tracks such as Wild Dances, Dance with the Wolves, Play Muiscian and many other nice tracks. Her vocal skills are much better then people are willing to give her credit for. She is also nice to look at and she has an amazing body and looks. I would not consider this to be your regular ""euro trash"" music as she is way too tallented to be bunched together with many of the hacks that sing during the eurovision song contest. The remixes are well done and the beat for her songs is very hypnotic."
1,Untrustworthy Product,"I received a homemade-looking copy of book on CD. I am not sure if it is an original or a bootleg copy and after trying to deal with the publisher, I don't trust them at all.After making my purchase, I started receiving emails soliciting a 5-star review from the Platinum Millenium Publishing company. If you buy this product, they will ask you to give them a positive review and promise to send you 2 free items in return. Don't do it.I left a positive review months ago and, even after several follow-up emails, I have not heard a thing from this company and I have not received my free items."
2,Good General Knowledge But Needs More Information,"I just read this guidebook for the second time. It provides a good overview of living in Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica and Ecuador. However, I think anyone seriously considering living in Costa Rica or Mexico would profit more by reading one of the other travel guidebooks about residing in these countries. The other guides deal specifically with these countries and provide much more complete information."
3,Professional Courtesy and Research,"I founded International Relocation Services SA de CV in Mexico City over 25 years ago. The author chose our name to list as a reference for ""relocating"" to Mexico without checking with us. This normally would be FREE advertising, but since we only do corporate relocation in the major business centers of Mexico, it has been a minor irritation. I am amazed at the 20-30 letters i receive each year for the past many years; each is a request that i send everything they need to know about retiring in Mexico. i have a form letter that i send to each of these inquirers because i feel it would be rude not to; however, the real problem is that our company is in a book for ""retiring to Mexico"". I just wish she had checked with us or researched what the focus of our business is. On the positive side, i found lots of useful information in the book. If there is a reprint, i hope we are not in it or that we are designated as a corporate relocation source."
3,it is 2.5mm plug-in,"Nice stereo headphone, but it works fine most time only with HTC OEM PocketPC phone, not HP iPAQ H6315 which uses 3.5mm plug-in. Be careful. I returned mine.I even tried on other regualr cell phone, the push button is not working normally."
3,"Can't go wrong with the salt, pepper not so hot...","The pepper grinder stopped grinding a few months into it. The salt shaker is great with it's adjustable dosing, but how technical is that? I never complained about the pepper mill as it was part of a set, but had I paid $20, there would be some fussing! I Love OXO products, but I would save your money on this particular set."
5,Excellent!,My family and I visited the Carribean and forgot to purchase a CD of the great music we heard. This CD captures the wonderful sounds we heard and brings back memories of our trip.
1,I wish my brain would've blacked out watching this.,"I'm a huge horror fan, but this movie is really horrible! Please don't waste your time and money on this movie. I know you can definitely find something better to watch."
2,"Blackout ?, sure did 10 minutes into it.","Movie ? Blackout oh that snoozefest with three people trapped in an elevator.. yawn. How long would I last with this crew before I started to freak out, began eating one of them and beating the other 2 to death just out of sheer boredom ? I love the idea of this movie and I think the acting is fine the movie is to slow.Skip it and see ""M. Night Shyamalan"", ""Devil"", it is very much like this but better and heck it's the Devil not some dim-witted serial killer."
1,Blackout,"Blackout had me ""knocked out"" throughout the duration of the movie,so boring and the flashbacks make the plot dumber on top of that the scenes with salt and the lady cut up was unnecessary. Is the movie about being in a elevator stuck? or going through various flashbacks and then finally the best part of all is when the Movie ends! What happens to the bad guy other than that,a snooze."
2,"I agree, it's LAME","You have to sit through 60 minutes of people thinking back on their recent days memories, in order to get to 20 mins of some mild action. It was painfully slow and easily predictable."
2,Just okay; wastes Amber Tamblyn,"The fine actor Amber Tamblyn is wasted in a lousy script with a very forgettable story. I've already forgotten most of what little story there was. This could have been executed much better than it was. Too bad that not much was done with it, or with her skills."
3,"okay, not favorite","This CD is okay for ocean sounds lovers, but I didn't care for the foghorn sounds or whales that come later in it. It's more of a Cape Cod type of sound that the Caribbean, which I prefer. I wanted JUST waves."
1,CD Peaceful Ocean Surf,"Not recommended if what you want is a sleep aid (which is what I was searching for).Too many seagulls, foghorns, singing whales etc. for any sort of relaxation. Might be nice just for background or white noise, but not if you want to sleep!"
1,Big Mistake,Second Worst CD I ever bought..It just sounds like a lot of humming like a radio or tv thats lost its station...Terrible...
4,Tonny Harnnel debut,This is the Tonny's debut on TNT and shows exacltly why he stayed therte for over 20 years. Seven Seas is still as good today as it was then ans all tne other songs are great too. Must have for fans.
2,Average heavy metal,"TNT's debut (?) album includes two really good tracks (""Seven seas"" and ""Knights of the new thunder"") built on the classic heavy metal formula. The singer Tony Hansen have a rather high pitch voice, and on some songs it works just fine but on others, like ""Ready to leave"" it's far from good, and it seems as Hansen try to sound more or less like the superior Rob Halford (Judas Priest) and it's rather annoying. I would say that the material on this release is quite alright with cuts like the strutting ""Last summer's evil"", the fast ""Tor with the hammer"", and the ballad ""Without your love"". In ""Break the ice"", TNT sound very much like Dokken. The problem with TNT is that they're not unique in any way and in 1984 when this album was released, there were hundreds of bands just like TNT - some more talented, some less talented."
4,Great look into the emerging 80's rock scene!,"TNT are on of the great 80's rock acts. They put on a great live show and are talented musicians. The guitarist, Ronnie LeTekro is a skilled player with a sound much like Yngwie Malmsteen. The vocalist, Tony Harnell has that great tenor voice necessary for good 80's hard rock. The band is great and this was their first album, raw but excellent. Check out the tracks Last Summer's Evil, Seven Seas, and Break the Ice. Hey, and their European."
3,A Mixed Bag,"A very good english debut album.There are excellent tracks like - Knights of the Thunder, Seven Seas, Break the Ice, Tor with the Hammer, and Eddie.But the others have quality of below average."
5,Great game top,This is the second poker top table I have had andthis one is the BEST...lays over a regular card tablemaking it wonderful for 8 people to play pan or pokeror even to serve dinner for 8 people. Great additionto any home.Paula
5,Using all the time,"I had some reservations about a portable poker table top, but I've used it quite a bit, and the portability is turning out to be a bonus! Can go anywhere!"
3,poker table,"I really want to like this product but i guess the the bad side to this is that when you fold it up, some of the black chip holders made of plastic keep falling off. gotta be a way to keep it intact"
3,Small table,Well built but smaller than expected. If we can actually fit 8 adults at this table I will change my review.
1,UN Satisfied!,"I ordered this to host poker gatherings at the house. The box came looking like it came through a war zone. the delivery driver even commented on the condition. Hoping the table top was still in tact I opened the remains of the box and removed the table top. The zipper pulls of the nylon carrying case were both broken, the table appeared to me to have been used. The felt had black stains about 6 inches around in several places. I am a frequent buyer on amazon and am grateful for their ease of return in case of experiences like this."
2,Cheap material,I didn't even have it a month before the material on the inside came apart. I hardly used it.
2,Very cheap looking,"I was disappointed when this arrived. Although the A900 fits in it fine, the white stitching on the pouch makes the case very cheap looking (think NY purse knock-offs). I can't honestly recommend this product."
3,Not by Sir Winston,"Another novel by the American novelist Winston Churchill, distantly related, whose fame was such at the turn of the century that Winston SPENCER Churchill promised to use his middle name to distinguish himself. Belongs with CONISTON, THE CRISIS, A FAR COUNTRY, etc. -R. Langworth, Editor, FINEST HOUR, The Churchill Center, www.winstonchurchill.org"
3,"""You're kind of amusing, what with your j*****g off every time you see me.""","Nowhere near as gross and vile as it's rumored to be ""Goon"" is still a fun sick read and at only 138 pages you can get through it pretty fast.A lot of mutilated bodies have been piling up and police captain Straker thinks it's the work of Deep South Wrestling Conference wrestler Goon. So with the help of a super hot female reporter Straker goes undercover in the seedy world of wrestling groupies or ringrats. Repulsive sex scenes follow.After reading so much about this book I was disappointed overall in the community college level writing and the gross stuff wasn't that gross. Yea, I laughed a few times and there's no shortage of nastiness, but it's done in such an over the top way that a lot of the impact is lost. A good example is when you're watching ""South Park"" there's lots of gross stuff there but it's funny in its outrageousness not gross."
2,"I love Edward Lee but..... sorry, not this","First off, I love Edward Lee. He is a black comic genius. The Pig, The House, The Bighead, The Minotauress. All genius that had me laughing all the way.Goon is generally boring. It seems like a very basic story written by someone other than Lee (Pelan) where Lee has added several sections of gross sex. Lee is usually very good and very funny at this stuff but on this occasion it comes off as a half arsed effort that probably took him a couple of hours to write.There is one piece of classic Lee in this novel, a conversation between two police officers. The rest? Sorry, glad this was not my first Lee book.Not worth the $20 asking price. Sorry Ed. Love your work but this is lacklustre."
4,Good but there is better,"This is a sick, twisted, don't let it near you kids book thats great but too short (thats why 4 stars not 5). This book is really just the appetizer for ""FAMILY TRADITON"" GET THIS BOOK, READ IT, AND THROW-UP (in a good way)."
1,I don't care if these characters come home or not.,"After reading this adventure shared by a group of completely self-absorbed Westerners, I have only one concern - did Rustum make the plane?"
1,A waste of paper.,"This book is terrible. I am an avid reader and I am really sorry I wasted my time and money on it. The main character has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It was impossible to care what happened to this poor excuse for a women. How this novel could be described as fast-paced is beyond me. Three quarters way through the book I was still waiting for something, anything, to happen. At about this same point in the story the author tosses out a stream of vulgar language that seems to have no place in the book. Perhaps it is to get our attention away from falling asleep. Sweeping negative generalizations for nearly every ethnic group mentioned in the story abound. Iranians men are ridiculed right down to the size of their collective private parts. Was the author trying to be funny or just plain offensive? If you need to prop up the leg of a table perhaps this book would have some merit. How it could have been nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction I do not understand."
1,BEWARE! This is NOT the Wailin' Jennys,"Buyer beware! This album has been mis-filed as a Wailin' Jenny's album. It isn't! Al ""Wailin'"" Walker is a rockin' Vancouver blues musician...and while he's pretty darn good (and if you're into the blues, you might really enjoy this), the music you'll get if you buy this album won't be that of a Canadian folk trio. So, avoid the mistake I made and make sure you're getting the album you really want. This one happens to be from one of the best living blues pickers in North America.Amazon.com isn't the only one to get this wrong: It's listed among the Wailin' Jennys discography over at [...] as well. Hopefully someone here will read this and fix things."
5,fun book,"Silly, fun book. Light hearted reading, as you enter the world of teenage duo back in the Ol Days."
4,Great for speed breaks and standard breaks.,Length:: 0:55 MinsI love the handles because of the versatility to suspend the boards using rope for a speed break. You can also throw the board and break it in mid-air. The black board is the best (and hardest to break) and I have broken it over 200 times without significant change in its resilience. [...] I rate it's quality VERY GOOD. I'll write an updated review after I've broken it 1000 times.
5,Tired of broken or swollen fingers,"If you're tired of getting your fingers kicked, these ARE the boards to have, bar none. I can purchase better branded at a very good price making them cheaper, but I buy these preferentially. :)"
3,More 30% for shipping,"The board is what it is. Paying more than 30% for shipping really hurt. However, I couldn't find anyone else selling this."
1,Truly disappointing!,"Firstly, poor sound. Secondly, the film has been cut, heavily.Let us hope that Paramount release it on DVD soon, as it is their film. In the meantime, if anyone wants to see this film then just buy the Paramount VHS tape- it's very good quality for picture & sound & it is UNCUT! Do not waste your money or time on this poor attempt at a DVD release!!!"
1,Marvin and Burton??,"I can't believe two great actors would lend their names to this catastrophe. It wouldn't even make the B-movie list. Reviewers said there was a lot of editing out of violence. I can't imagine what could be restored to make this worth anything. It was cliche-ridden, poorly written and poorly acted. For example Burton's character was supposed to be crippled--Richard Burton hardly ever maintained that simple bit of acting. The Klan was an evil entity. Actually more insidious than the film depicts. So much more could have been made out of the story. Even the climactic scene was cut short. I can't believe it, but the best acting was done by OJ Simpson. Then there was the penniless white woman who was raped, She had a hair color job and make up that would have cost a month's salary--not convincingly destitute. Her rape was never cleared up--among several loose threads left dangling.It was even worse than the first BILLY JACK from the same era."
3,Believe It or Not,"I only recently saw this movie, although I remember seeing a preview of it in the theaters when it was originally released in the 70s. The preview included a scene of OJ Simpson sprinting across railroad tracks ahead of an oncoming train. In the movie this happens after his character shoots a Klansman. In the next scene Richard Burton and Lola Falana are driving away from the shooting in, believe it or not, a Ford Bronco. Next thing you know, OJ comes out from his hiding place in the back of the vehicle, still with his rifle, and asks Burton to stop and let him out in a rural area. After a heated discussion, he leaves after also pulling a hunting knife out of the Bronco. Coincidence or beyond coincidence?"
3,a crude film with brutal scenes but makes you think,The Klansman a 1974 thriller Starring Lee Marvin and Richard burton is a delberate rasict picture and makes no qualms about it that's why it's an okay film. Marvin is an honest sherrif caught in the crossfire between the whites and the blacks over the rape of a white woman by a blackman. Burton with a southern accent pretty funny to hear plays a local landowner who comes under fire because black men and woman work for him and he thinks that both white and black should get along. Grusome But yet interesting film dealing with a subject that's been around for centries. Critics pan this film I do not because even though it's not the greatist film it does show people about racial bigotry and how it can lead to viloence. Most films today would rather make some sort of joke when it comes to dealing with films like this The Klansman is a good film and does well with it's subject. Lee Marvin did a good Job in this film. It's a shame he died too prematurly.
3,Through The Eyes Of A Child,"I was nine years old in 1974 when this picture came to film in Oroville, California. I'm a native of Oroville. Although the quality of the performance of the main characters leaves much to be desired,It leaves a good feeling when I view the picture now to see some scenes in Oroville (and some surrounding areas) that have REALLY changed over the past thirty three years. Many of the extras I know along with the memory of one Saturday when a scene was filming downtown were the Butte County Courthouse was once located."
1,Pure Garbage,"This DVD is Complete Rubbish! No, not because of the Racism, The Klan, Lynchings, etc., but because of the Poor Acting, Film Quality, and Editing. The DVD Producers actually turned this into a PG Rated Fim...Oh, it's still called an ""R"", but the Lola Falana Rape Scene was Spliced so heavily that it not only fails to move Me emotionally, I would miss it entirely should I blink My Eyes. The Original Opening Scene, Where a Topless Young Black Lady (Jeanne Bell) is tossed around by White Men standing in a Circle is Edited Out as well, the Producers try hard to omit Racially-Charged Scenes, but to do so leaves the Film empty, unfortunately they keep the Redneck Characters intact, the crappy acting from both Marvin and Burton, and a Dull O.J. Simpson, whose own Voice was overdubbed in this Film....."
3,The Klansman (movie),"I saw it many years ago when it came out in theatres. Good movie, that's why I ordered it this day and age. The quality was not very good. The colors were off, the soundtrack was a bit off, and there was a skip in the movie. I didn't pay much for it and still consider it a good deal. I happen to like old movies and actors of yester year."
1,Sad waste of two powerhouse talents,"Richard Burton was one of the all-time great thespians and it's a travesty that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences never honored him with an Oscar for any of his numerous nominations. Lee Marvin was a dynamic actor in his own right as well. Why they are wasting their time in this ugly, worthless (...) movie is anybody's guess.Many films that incorporate a racist theme merit importance when they depict the horror and any subsequent violence that such bigotry and hatred derives. This film does nothing but present a shallow glimpse into the racial tensions stemming from the South (a common and unfortunate stereotype).One interesting note: OJ Simpson made his film debut here as a radical ""Black Panther""-type militant who murders white folks whenever he has a chance. (...)"
3,Good Book,"What I really like about Jung's Books is that he's never narrow, and never afraid to sound mystic and spiritual. The man is open to all possibilities and, in my opinion, this value is crucial to the growth of humanity."
4,Dense but well worth the read,"Modern Man in Search of a Soul is extremely dense but also extremely rewarding. Found in the book is a collection of Carl Gustav Jung's essays about different topics. My favorite in this book were problems of psychotherapy,aims of psychotherapy,stages of life, and contrasts between Freud and Jung. Some of the essays weren't as powerful to me as the others but I believe that has to do more about me then the book.Carl Jung's writing can be difficult and sometimes complicated to follow. For those who take the time to head and understand the deep and philosophical questions that Jung answers about life and psychology, your view on life will truly be transformed."" The needs and the necessities of individuals vary. What sets one free is for another a prison--as for instance normality and adaptation (Jung, 1933, pg. 47)."""
5,splendid,"Barbara Lea is one of the most unaffected vocalists I've ever heard. There's an effortless quality to her singing that is beguiling. On three of the tracks she's accompanied by piano, guitar, and bass; on the others by quintets or septets beautifully arranged by Dick Cary. How often do you hear a jazz ballad accompanied by clarinet, bassoon, alto horn, and four rhythm? Excellent musicians. Nice selection of familiar and unfamiliar songs. How often do you hear the verse to ""Ain't Misbehavin'""? A mix of ballads and mid-tempo swing tunes. I should also mention the fine trumpet work by Johnny Windhurst."
3,Old College text,Rereading old college history books has been a thrill. And the cost of 30 year old history books is much more palatable that current texts.
3,Caution: Authorized IT personnel only,"This is a book that should be read only by seasoned IT professionals. As the director of a small academic lab I don't have the luxury of having adequate IT support, so I, like many others, have to wing it. With its rave reviews I thought this book would help, but it didn't. Another 50-100 pages (a relatively small increment in this tome) to compactly introduce and define some of the jargon would have helped immensely and expanded the intended audience to those familiar with IT, but as a sideline, not a career. That being said, I appreciated the author's candor and attention to ""gotchas"" that official documentation doesn't mention."
3,Not for Web Server help,"If you are looking for OS X web server inside information, this is not it. Only about 15 pages, out of 800, discuss the web server. And the information on those pages mostly just covers the already intuitive interface. It would not be fair for me to dis the whole book based on this one gaping whole - but since that was the information I was looking for more information on, I was sorely tempted."
1,Not happy,"When I got my nozzles, they where not what is shown in the pictures, you show here! And I payed $13. and change too return them! I would like my money back, but mostly would like too get 10 of the nozzle shown!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Ricer works well,"Always wanted one of these. This one works fine. Mashed potatos came out perfectly at Thanksgiving. Easy clean-up, I just put it in the dishwasher. I will use this alot."
3,Won't Rust,"This is a good ricer, my only complaint is they could have made it a little larger. If you have a big job you might consider a larger unit."
5,Works great!,"Bought this solely to fix my hashbrowns--and it worked! For years, I've dealt with soggy, mushy hashbrowns. After some googling, I discovered that this was because there was too much moisture in them, and they were getting steamed instead of pan-fried. Took a long time to bite the bullet to buy a gadget that I'm likely going to use for only one dish, but it was worth it. My potatoes come out crisp with a nice texture now. It is a quality product, doesn't feel cheap at all. So glad I bought it."
4,Nice Ricer,"I purchased this ricer for my wife for Christmas. She had been wanting to buy one for sometime, but had never purchased one. The product is sturdy and did a very nice job on the potatoes. I was initially nervous because the handle did not look solid in the picture, but she had no problem with closing the ricer. It is also relatively easy to clean and I would recommend it for the price."
4,Great,"An excellent potato ricer, it is an awesome way to have hash-browns all the time, really easy and fast, great price for this tool"
4,Worksgreat!,No more lumpy mashed potatoes. This ricer is well-made and works just as advertised. It is also easy to clean. I definitely recommend it to others.
3,Has a very short lifespan!,"Liked it when it came in.Little by little the stem that holds the smasher plate started bending.Tried several times to align it, but it's has become totally useless.If you use a potato ricer often, try to get a more industrial version."
2,OXO can do better,"I normally am a fan of OXO products, but this one is just to flimsy. I bent the flat steel between the handle and the disk the second time using it, now it's in the trash.My wife had used it maybe a dozen times before me, so maybe for a gentle person it would be fine."
2,defective handle,Length:: 0:12 MinsI expected a new potato ricer. But I was disappointed at my new potato ricer. It is different item I saw on the picture. There is no soft plastic(?)on metal handle. Amazon shoud check before shipping.
3,Potato Ricer,"This was a christmas gift. I have had no real experience with this item, but if you are looking for a potato ricer this was a real nice one and the value you get with ourchasing this was great."
3,Not for spaetzle,"Hi,I bought this ricer with the plan to make spaetzle for my birthday party. But it was quiet a disaster. The holes are to close to each other so noodles merge right after getting through and it produces one flat disk of dough. Also to stem that it supposed to push the dough is to flat and doesn't seal well with the walls. So depending on the thickness of the dough one usually loses a lot and cleaning is a mess, too. I warned you.Best regards,Max."
5,Potato Ricer,Have not used yet but I think that I will love it. Seems to be well made. Think I will take it to my sisters for Thanksgiving dinner. We will use it then. Thank you
3,ricer,"I wanted something that Would squash peas for pea soup. I thought the ricer would do it, but it didn't. But I'm keeping the ricer as I might be able to use it for smashing something else."
3,"As ricers go, this one is really nice.","As ricers go, this one is great. It's very sturdy and comfortable. However, mine sits idle now that I have a food mill. The food mill does the same job yet is much more versatile.Unless you're REALLY fixated on getting a potato ricer, check out food mills instead. They're well worth the extra cost."
3,Could be better,It's an okay ricer but has a tendency to push potatoes upward instead of out through the bottom. Would be better if the entire can was sieve like to prevent this.
4,Perfect mashed potatoes,"This tool is a must-have for preparing mashed potatoes. It takes all of the effort and lumps out of making perfect mashed potatoes.A little bit of potatoes can squeeze out from the top of the lid as you push it down (which is why I only gave 4 stars) but since the gap is so narrow, what squeezes out is also ""mashed"" so it can be thrown in with the rest of the potatoes.My girlfriend complained that it is a little hard to squeeze when packed to the rim with potatoes, but this can be controlled by putting less potatoes in it each time.Overall an excellent product. Very easy to clean."
4,Works Great,"I had my doubts about this item because it felt a little flimsy when I removed it from the box. It's lightweight and the handles seemed a little small. However, it worked flawlessly and made super-smooth mashed potatoes. It's very easy to press the potatoes through the holes.The only downside is that it takes a little time because you can't fit a whole potato in the ricer, you need to cut the potato into workable chunks, and it's a little bit messy. But the consistent smoothness is well worth it. I liked this much, much better than a standard masher.A couple of tips: make sure you use soft enough potatoes (I used russets) and place the potato so that the peel faces the top, not the holes. You also must remove the peel each time you press (that's where the messy part comes in.)Recommended!"
1,BEWARE-THIS IS A DUPLICATE OF THE OTHER VIDEO!,"The title of this video states that it is VOL 2 of the Bell Telephone Hour video, something that has been available for several years now. In fact, these two videos are the same; there is no VOL 2 of the Bell Telephone Hour video. It is an excellent video, however, just don't buy it if you already have the first one that was issued."
4,Interesting book,"The book is interesting in that two of the three novellas in it have been made into movies, Revenge, and Legends of the Fall.I'll go on record saying that although I enjoyed the movie, I thought the book was better, although it's not really that long a book. Still, even in a work this short, there are depths that can't really be explored in a 2-hour movie, so if you liked the movie, I would strongly recommend you read the book.Harrison has a direct but poetic style, and his male characters are well-drawn and believable. The women don't have much of a role in his books, but I don't mind that really. Harrison is a writer about old-fashioned masculine virtues and ideals of the sort that perhaps don't exist in our society anymore. But if you want equally well-developed women characters, you'll need to look elsewhere."
3,Found the Book Disappointing!,"Sorry, but I liked the movie much better than the book. I like for my ""women"" characters to be as clearly defined as the men, and I like a sensitivity in understanding of women that Larry McMurtry has shown in his work. I consider Larry McMurtry, as a male author, to have an uncanny insight into the nature of women.This is an okay story, although gloomy. Perhaps male readers will be more appreciative. There are poetic narrative moments, but not enough to compensate.Evelyn Horan - teacher/counselor/authorJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl Books One - Three"
3,"Interesting stories, not quite what I expected","Expected a novel, the tale on which one of my favorite movies was based; in fact, it was one of several short stories/novellas. I did enjoy the stories and characters, however."
5,book review,My husband loves the entire series by Jim Harrison. I just ordered two more books. They arrived very quickly and I received what I ordered
2,LIBERAL WET DREAM,I read the title story and dismissed it as a liberal wet dream without purpose or destination or lesson. It has no sense to it.
3,Good for tight spaces,This item is very handy for small and tight spaces. The only problem I have found is that my shop vac over heated due to the restriction of air. I also found them cheaper at lowes after I bought them.
5,cool add on,I bought a garage vac. and then added these to the deal. I do Old Vespa Scooter work and I love the compact reach of these tools.
2,Too small,"Be aware how tiny these tools really are, what appears to be a huge part in the photo is the 1.25"" adapter! These tools are so small that they almost completely block off the airflow. They *will* work, albeit very very slowly, I found them to be almost useless."
4,Pretty Good,"First off, as some other reviews have stated, these attachments are really small. Most are smaller in diameter than a pencil. The attachments work pretty well at getting into small areas, but the power of the shop vac is decreased when using the smaller attachments. Overall, I am pretty happy with the product though as it works great to suck or blow crap out of tight areas. If you don't mind the small decrease in power, and need something to get into tight areas, then give these a try."
2,Disappointment,"Disappointing product. Once attachments are applied and extention used, any amount of pressure used created the parts to come apart. Had to use tape to keep parts from falling apart during use."
5,"Great Product, much cheaper elsewhere!",I bought this at Walmart for $11.97 yesterday. I was finally able to clean out from in between the front seats of my car and the console.
5,Mini-Shop Vac,"I was hoping for a powerful, but small shop vac and this is it. My garage clutter alarm sounded recently and storing this model helped to cure that issue! Sturdy, well-made, convenient, multiple functions I can actually use and enough motor to work hard without dimming my lights. Just right as Goldilocks said!!"
1,Look for the original translation,"I bought this book thinking it would be the same as an older translation that I loaned and did not get back. It is not the same. The older translation I had carried the anointing of Watchman Nee's teaching. That was lost in this one. All the additions of the ""translators"" in this book make Nee's teaching unintelligible."
5,A Must read for Every Christian,"This book in the Bible is never taught on and the reason is because few if any have the sort of understanding of the book that is revealed in this publication. Many think the book in the Bible is almost pornographic but they are very misguided in their thoughts. Read it, you will never look at yourself and the Lord the same way as you have before. Read it and understand your pilgrimage with your God of the Bible."
2,"Poor quality, flimsy lid","I do not recommend this product. The copper components are thin, especially the lid. First time I ordered it, the lid came crushed, even though the packaging was intact. Returned it for a replacement. The second one I received had a lid that was not flat and did not seat on the pot. The bolt that holds the band around the ceramic insert pot is unattractive and looks as if it will eventually fail. All in all, I feel that this is a poor quality double boiler and not worth the price."
5,Why is this book not on the bestsellers?,"Laurence Shames and Peter Barton have written one of the best books since Tuesdays with Morrie. I enjoyed every page and found Mr. Barton's life and dying experience to be funny, sad and touching. We are given the opprotunity to see inside of a man who worked hard and had ""everything"" only to die at a young age. However, he provides the reader with insight as he goes through the dying process. What he learned about his parents, his wife, children, himself and life. What really becomes important when you know your time is limited and how it effects how you send that time.After reading this book my only questions was why has someone not gotten the word out about this touching story? If you like Tuesday with Morrie you will love Not Fade Away..you go way from reading the book with a greater knowledge of what we all will have to face day.Mr. Barton has blessed us with his experience. READ IT-- and spread the word!"
4,Cruel Doubt,Excellent. Excellent read. McGInnis is one of only two authors who can get me to stay up three hours after my bedtime reading.
4,Great job with a difficult subject,"I thought McGinnis did an incredible job with some very, very touch subject matter. I read ""Blood Games"" as well, and while both had their advantages, ""Cruel Doubt"" was far and away the better book. Like other readers, I was shocked that Moog was convicted without physical evidence, and while I'm sure he was involved, I feel confident that others -- including Henderson and Pritchard -- were also involved. Unlike Bledsoe, McGinnis took the time after the trial to gauge those involved on what THEY thought really happened, and that is where the book really gets great. I, too, am hoping for another book on this crime.Along those lines, does anyone know of a site or message board that addresses this particular crime? Thanks."
3,Very well written but a frustrating story...,"I bought this book after reading ""Fatal Vision"" which I found riveting. ""Cruel Doubt"" is written with the same amazing detail and imagery, and has fascinating insights into the people involved. What I found frustrating has nothing to do with his storytelling ability. I personally found that there's just too many unanswered questions, a lack of evidence and confusing conflicting stories from the accused to make it a truly satisfying read. I guess the problem is that McGinniss writes so well that you truly care about the people involved and you need some sort of closure. I couldn't put it down when I was reading it but I found myself wanting 'more' when it was finished."
4,My first taste of Elliott Smith,"I don't know if it's his best. I don't think it is, but I like the CD, and it's one that I will be playing for awhile when I drive. I will be getting the two CDs after this one to see if he has grown. He has a good musical sensibility. Although it's a lo-fi album, he has written songs with complexity. This tells me that he has a lot more in mind than what he has done on this CD. I hope that he has gotten out of the solipsism in the work that follows this."
5,Wow.,"Nothing to say that hasn't been said before, but yes, a very good CD from the most talented singer/songwriter of the 90's.Alameda/Rose Parade are amazing."
4,"Eclectic, raw and truly creative","Either/Or is a fine example of Elliott Smith's unique songwriting, his ""whisper"" singing voice and multi-tracking harmonies drifting over complex, often schizophrenic chord progressions and song structures - indeed, his brain was wired differently. Then there is the darkness - Either/Or is a raw recording, an appropriate soundscape for the angst that appeared to plague him to the end. His psychological issues aside, Elliott Smith was a songwriter's songwriter - he was gifted artist, a tormented soul - perhaps the two go hand-in-hand, but sometimes the most beautiful things are not all fun and games. GENRES: Rock, Mellow Rock, Contemporary Folk.BUY IF YOU LIKE: The Beatles, Wilco, Nick Drake.MUST HEAR TRACKS: ""Alameda,"" ""Between The Bars,"" ""Angeles,"" ""Say Yes."""
4,Great,"This mellow moody masterpiece is fantastic. When i listen to this i just want to lay back on my bed and just listen to Elliott. He was such a great singer/songwriter. I have Either/Or and his Self titled album. I like this one a little bit more than the S/T though. The only reason this baby didnt get 5 stars in my mind is that it seems like he has a little bit more potential in him than he really showcases in this album..i dont have every Elliott Smith album like i said, so maybe one of his other ones show him at his best....Bottom line is this cd is great and i would suggest it to anyone that just wants to mellow out.Best Tracks: ""Speed Trials"",""No Name #5"",""Angeles"""
5,Copacetic,"This is a melancholy cd with 12 tracks of brilliantly mournful tunes. If you're into sad songs and ballads (of big nothing), then you've found the right guy. Smith, a heroin addict during much of his peculiar career, has an incredible, seraphic voice, and inventive melodies that will make you feel despondent or happy. Either/Or. Personally, I think the songs are very bleek and depressing, but they're also so stark and sincere that you may feel a warm happiness from the sheer beauty of the songs. I highly recommend Say Yes, Ballad of Big Nothing, Between the Bars, and Alameda for some happy/sad, ambivalent listening."
2,Mediocre,"I hate to be the voice of dissent on this board. I bought this album after going to a really great Mary Lou Lord concert where all she did was rave about Eliot, so I just went out and purchased it, without ever hearing any Eliot songs. The album is very quiet and Eliot's voice is high and not very good. The lyrics are disappointingly shallow. The melodies are okay. ""Between the Bars"" is the one salvaging tune on the CD, it's a nice little song (little being the operative word). Then I went online and read some reviews of Eliot Smith. Critics were pretty mixed, but mostly positive. Mary said Eliot reminded her of Joni Mitchell in her ""Cold Blue Steel"" phase. I just can't see the connection.I just can't really see what's so great about this album. Your immensely positive reviews interest me, however, and I'll have to go back and listen to it again. I doubt I'll change my mind. I think Eliot just needs to be louder."
1,.,"Product arrived so long after purchase that I assumed it had been lost in the mail; at least three weeks elapsed between purchase and my receipt of the item. When it finally did arrive, the product was not as described; it had so many deep, visible scratches that it won't play at all in most CD players. If it does play, it skips uncontrollably every 4-6 seconds, halts, repeats, and is generally unlistenable. Don't get me wrong, I love Elliott Smith, but I would NEVER buy from this seller again"
1,sheer regurgitation,"If someone can sell this many albums and make a living off of blatantly imitating Nick Drake, that is truly a sad comment on the current state of popular music.My prediction? This will wind up in cut-out bins within five years, while the Nick Drake ouerve will continue to endure.'Nuff said."
5,Soundtrack of perfection,"this was the last of all elliott smith albums i have heard and by far the best. yes, its true, everything he has put out is amazing but either/or is really in my opinion his masterpeice. musically it really dosent make sence. the chords are odd and dont seem like they would fit together, but after listing to the album i think thats whats makes this album close to perfection. not one song is worth skipping over, either/or is the kind of album that you put in and just let play. i truley believe that elliott smith is the most talented song writer of this time."
3,Hits and Misses,"Ballad of Big Nothing stands out as the best song on the album. Speed Trials, Cupid's Trick and Rose Parade are the others that gave the album some flavor. 2:45 AM musically is cool, but the lyrics didnt do anything for me. I felt the accoustic songs on XO were better."
5,A top 5 deserted island album,"On a deserted island, with only 5 albums, which would you prefer to have with you to listen to over, and over and over? The songs on this album have serious emotional resonance and staying power. A true work of art, skillfully capturing the essence of Portland. I love you Portland!!!"
1,"Great Idea, Poor Follow-through","I have read many books of this genre, more than one of Mr. Holzer's. This is by far his worst work. The biggest problem is the way that he writes. It is apparent in his other books, but not as prominent. He comes off as if he is the world's best ghost hunter and that his opinion's are fact. Many times he states in the book that he doubts and discredits any person that hasn't in the past had some kind of psychic occurence. There is no history to any ""haunt"". He and his medium are the only credible people in any story. My overall consenus is that he is getting old and is trying to cash in on a few more books. there was no thought or follow through, just cocky, arrogant fatigue in this book. If you want to read a real good ghost book, check out Citro."
2,Doesn't stay put,"Didn't stay put on the highway. I had a suction cup come loose and flap against my helmet for the rest of my commute. When I arrived, I pulled the rest of it off and shoved it into my saddlebag where it has remained."
3,It's Captivating,"I just started to read, and it's wonderful, i'm glad the author says he is still learning and doesn't make you feel like you will fail, it's great so far, and I cannot wait to finish it and lend it to my friends."
2,To churchy for my taste,"I was hoping that this book was more nondenominational from the summary and reviews I read, but what I got seems very ""evangelist preacher"" to me. There are some good suggestions that I'll keep for my journey, but I was looking for somethign less prescribed. I guess I'll keep searching for a non-denominational guide to a relationship with God."
5,Teacher/student friendly,"Easy reading. Lots of REAL-LIFE examples to demonstrate the principles and procedures. This is my FAVORITE behavior book, I refer to it all of the time!!!"
4,Got what I paid for.,"The textbook arrived in a timely manner. It has highlighted marks in it, along with pages being bent back, but all together in decent condition. You get what you pay for."
1,not student friendly,"My professor unfortunately had to choose this book for class, which I dreadfully abhor and never want to open/read it again. I find it unclear and not very much helpful in presenting the principles of behaviorism. The tear out quizzes are somewhat pointless and repetitive (3 for each chapter). The chapter summaries are poor and everything, including the text layout and color is extremely plain and again, poorly done. What I disliked most about this book is that the definitions are extremely WORDY and confusing!!! For example, in defining Positive & Negative reinforcers, they had to break it down into a THREE PART definition???1. The occurence of a behavior2. is blah blah3. results in the strengthening of that behavior blah blah blah...I find it pointless and hard to follow. Not very concise at all. :["
2,don't buy this air conditioner,"It does cool ok (not the greatest) but takes a lot of energy. The vent hose gets extremly warm. The water drips into its tank and the sound of the dripping is like a faucet dripping, very annoying. Tank has to be emptied every hour if you don't want to hear the dripping."
3,French Elevator Music,"I bought this CD for one song that I heard when I watched the movie ""Darjeeling Limited"". I got the one song, however, most of the other songs are pretty average, but I do love the song ""Les Champs-Elysees""."
2,Not Practical,"As other people have stated that changing your handwriting and emphasizing certain cognitive change could lead to self-improvement, the ""Vimala"" alphabet I believe is not a practical in today's business environment. There are plenty of much better self-help books if that is what you need."
2,Has Your Handwritting Deteriorated?,"Do you feel a sense of loss because your handwriting has become illegible to others over the years? Do you have trouble even reading it yourself? Do you feel a sense of loss and longing for fluid,legible hand-written expression? Vimala Rodger's book will open the gate. She will clean up your penmanship and along the way reveal things that we never learned in school about the power, joy, and significance of handwriting. Give your computer keyboard a rest. Pick up Vimala's book, a pen, and go for it! It is pure magic."
1,lacking knowledge of subject matter,better information on handwriting analysis is avalable from other sources.
4,Improves your handwriting if your willing to work at it.,"I have been one of those people who hated the sight of their own handwriting. I always chose to type my assignments through college, even some math homework, when I was going to be turning it in for a grade. I finally realized that I wanted to change my writing and Vimala gave me a great book to assist with my desired change. The book is very informative and directs you in how letters should be written. At the sametime she allows you to choose exactly what changes you make. The book's name says it all, I no longer look at my handwriting like I want it to go away, now I want it to stay!"
3,Check Vimala look first,"This book make a good handwriting personality analysis. But when starts with Vimala Alphabet, well, you must be sure you like it. I stopped reading at these point (page 100). Vimala made a good cause of the benefits four your personality about writing with this system. But if you don't like how it look, you must forget it."
5,do it,"this will work if you stick to it. What it really does, is teach you how to think about how you think. Recommend it highly."
2,No changes here,"I do like crossing the t's on the top, and writing my first initial as the star A, but other than that, I generally find it a rather ugly script. Perhaps that's why it's not working for me, but I've not noticed any changes in myself or my life despite months of writing the t's and A's as she says."
5,Great self help book.,"I recommend this book to everyone. I have been working with it for a year and my handwriting has changed. Just as Vimala says in the book, I have experienced wonderful inner changes. Vimala Rogers gets us back to the alphabet letters as the sacred symbols that they are and always have been. S."
3,see if you like the script first,"I've been trying to make the changes Vimala recommends, but I honestly don't like the appearance of her recommended handwriting. Lower case g's and s's are identical (basically an open-top figure eight). They don't even resemble the actual letters. Nobody can read my writing since I started using Vimala's alphabet. I feel like I've given this my best effort, but I'm not really finding this useful."
5,This book is awesome,I love this book! It will take mw some time to incorporate all of the changes I want to make in my hand writing. I can feel the energy change and will continue to work at it till it is automatic.
5,Seriously Funny! Great for the whole family.,"I have never seen a Shaun the Sheep episode before. I was sent the DVD to review on my blog. I enjoyed the entire DVD so much I watched it twice in one day.I realize people might see this as more of a ""kid"" program but I can tell you as a 40+ year old I thought the show was not only incredibly adorable but funny too. It's good, clean fun!This is GREAT for the whole family.There is only one holiday episode (which is very sweett). The other six clips are not holiday related (although two feature Winter/cold weather).I loved this! I'm hooked on Shaun the Sheep and I'll have to pick up more DVDs."
3,Misleading Marketing,"Docked two stars -- one for the misleading cover and the other for the inadequate product description. This is a set of seven Shaun the Sheep videos, only one of which is about Christmas. The cover makes it look as if this is all about Christmas. The description simply says that the running time is 50 minutes. It does not say that there is only one Christmas video that runs for seven minutes. Don't get me wrong. We love Shaun the Sheep. This is five-star content. What we don't like is misleading marketing. Had I known the particulars of this DVD before, I would not have bought it."
5,Terrific...arthritis sufferers in the house,"Oxo's knife glides over the item you wish to peal, sharp and easy to direct. The gripping piece is larger than normal knives and shaped more comfortably in the palm making it feel lighter in hand than our other knives. We have this knife (back to get a few extras) and the swivel top parer that is also a delight to use--head and shoulders above the regular parer for ease and comfort. Both Oxo items highly recommended."
3,Good grip... Mediocre blade,"This would be a fantastic knife if it had a better blade. Like all OXO Good Grips products, it is ergonomically designed and would be good for long use. Unfortunately, the blade is light and made of shoddy metal. It will not hold a good edge. Of course, I normally use good German knives, so I may have been spoiled."
5,Great Knife for a Great Price!,I really like the size and the shape of the grip on this knife. It's very easy to handle and very nicely sharp. And it's very easy to keep clean.
4,I Like It,"Have searched all over for a knife like this. I have arthritis and it is very difficult for me to hold things in my hand. I love the handle on this item I can finally go back to peeling apples, potatoes, etc. I recommend this item for anyone with arthritis."
4,Crescent Heavy Duty Nippers 14 Inch,"I used these for nipping the bottoms of roofing nails in my deck roof. Couldn't get them flush, but for painting purposes the tool was o.k. Definitely won't work on heavier gauge nails."
2,Disappointing,"Yonder Mountain String Band's rapid rise to fame, and their success in delivering bluegrass music to a mainstream audience has been impressive. Their gritty, simple, energetic sound has been a trademark of sorts, and leaves audiences to enjoy the music without having to invest too much energy interpreting what they hear -- it is straight-forward picking, with a twist.Straight-forward continues with this album, but with a foggy, studio sound indicative that all good things come to an end. Yonder has found a producer, a channel to larger audiences, and with that the obligations of the music business. This CD smacks of production, money, and a tour.I can't comment on any one song in particular because, unfortunately, they are lackluster."
2,kind of boring,"You know ,I have to apologetically say I didn't really like this too much. I love bluegrass and play banjo but it just wasn't my style. I expected alot of creativity but it was just kind of predictable and rock and rollish. I threw it away."
1,Change won't always do you good,"After the intricate instrumental interplay and inspiring vocals on Elevation and Town by Town, I was disappointed by YMSB's newest self-titled album. The vocals are flat, uninspired and with very few harmonies which made their previous albums a joy to listen to. Their ""acoustic"" instruments rarely sound such and the occasional electric dissonance is not welcomed. Dump the new producer and get back to your roots boys!"
2,YMSB,I have followed these guys for some years now and they are always pushing the bar for what is considered bluegrass and I have always enjoyed the ride. This albulm seems to be a bit over produced and some of the rough edges that make me like them are lost. There are a few good tunes but overall I would say go and see them live for the true YMSB vibe.
4,"New terrority, well explored","""Sidewalk Stars"" is wonderful song, and unlike what YMSB is (or was) about. ""Troubled Mind"" is another great bluegrass song by them. And so this release straddles rock/jam with blasts of bluegrass. Not sure what there isn't to like, it won't be liked by those who don't like acts stretching, or who dislike anything that isn't bluegrass or acoustic. But those who like to adventure and those who like to ramble will listen and say: ""Let them go""."
4,Good Basic Information,Good basic information. Pictures & diagrams clear. Same exercises shown on the Home Gym Exercises Laminated Poster.
2,Skip it!,Very basic book that covers no new ground. Go to your local library and find a fitness/weight lifting book. You won't miss anything by taking this route and passing on this relatively useless book.
3,A good place to start,Although this handbook didn't specifically match the features of my new Wieder - I got a lot of tips on proper warm up exercises and basic information on HOW to use these machines. I was disappointed that most of the mid-range machines do NOT come with instruction manuals and there doesn't seem to be many available. So if you do not have access to a personal trainer - then this Handbook is a good place to start. It is well written with clear instructions and illustrative photos. Useful for ALL beginners as well as the more experienced that haven't worked out in a while and need some refresher information.
3,The Book Version of the Chart by Same Author,"This is a very small phamphlet-type ""book"", covering the basic exercises for some types of home gyms. It is as it's name implies, a ""quick reference"" or refresher, and is in no means a complete book of possible routines on the average home gym. As I mentioned in a similar review of the author's companion home gym wall chart, it covers basic exercises for most of the basic muscle groups, as performed on some home gyms. Whether it would be best for your specific gym, is something for you to decide. I found it useful for basic reference, to get an idea of the type of excerises that exercise various muscle groups. It should not be viewed as definitive or exclusive, but only as a reference tool that would require additional / supplemental information. But since my gym did not come with much use instructions (apparently most don't), it has proven to be better than nothing. With that said, if you need something similar, I recommend it with those limitations."
3,Not what I expected,I was expecting more than a booklet of exercises. I guess I didn't read the information closely enough.
5,No cracking here!,"I have had this for a year and use it more days than not. No cracking. It works great, but I will say it is harder to use in bigger apples. Perhaps that is why others had cracking problems, but I am only speculating.If you eat apples often this is worth the money, even if it only lasts a year."
2,"With lots of use, these will crack","If you plan to use this a lot, don't get the Oxo one. Our family is going on it's fifth one! The company will gladly replace them, but you have to pay to ship it to them. Granted, we have 7 children and we eat a LOT of apples, so I am sure these would be fine for normal families...but if you plan to use it a lot, I would recommend one that is all metal instead. BTW, I love all our other Oxo products...this is the only one with which I have had trouble. It is just poorly designed for continual use."
4,Pretty good,"This does it's job, although I found it much harder to use than I had imagined. Going through the first half of the apple was easy, but once I got to the second half it became almost impossible. Maybe it was just the big Apple I was trying to cut, I'm not sure."
4,"Good slicer and corer, but could be better","It's easy to use and clean-up. I've noticed what other reviewers complained about - small pieces left in the metal folds; but I'm not concerned about it. The pieces are extremely small and will eventually fall out. There are much worse things to be bothered about than that.My biggest complaint is that the corer isn't quite big enough for large apples. It gets most of the core, just not all. What's left on the slices is edible, the leftover core in some slices is a bit tougher (maybe 1-2 slices/large apple).It's also not very good with apples that aren't straight/flat/sits crooked). Overall it's a nice tool to have for quick slicing and coring; just not the perfect ool."
5,Great ergonomic corer & divider for apples and other fruit such as pears ...,"Since we eat a lot of fruit around my house, this is an item that gets a real workout. It is essentially used on a daily basis. This corer/divider is well designed and comfortable to use with its cushioned grips. The blades are very sharp and slice through fruit almost like a ""hot knife through butter"", just a bit of downward pressure is needed to get the corer going. The central - circular piece for coring - is larger than on comparable items by other manufacturers which makes the entire process of coring and dividing apples or pears so much easier. In general, I have always appreciated the ""sound ergonomic design"" of OXO kitchen tools/gadgets. This one will not disappoint. Buy one of these soon and start eating all those apples/pears, etc. that your're processing on a regular basis. The life you save may be your own!"
2,Doesn't cut it.,Most importantly bits of apple remain wedged between the seams of the blades. Hand washing or dishwasher fail to remove the bits. Having to pick at it with a toothpick or tweezer makes the tool a net time loss. In addition as other reviews stated it doesn't cut all the way through on some of the apples. Sending it back !
1,don't waste your money,"center corer too small, dosen't cut all the way threw apple, you have too pick pieces out and pull apart"
2,OXO Fail.,"I love OXO. I thought they could do no wrong. But this apple corer/divider was a waste of money. We had an old stainless steel one without the handles, so I thought this one would work better. It does not work any better at all! The apple gets stuck in it, and it's a pain to clean."
3,spits in your face,"Perhaps it is common to all apple corers, but this one spits apple juice in your face as you are go down."
3,Can't core all the way through,"The corer doesn't cut all the way through the apple.. so I usually end up just breaking off the slices. Also, the handles flexes a little too much, wish it was stiffer. I'm afraid in a few months, I'll break off one the handles."
1,Pure Junk,"I intended to replace an antique apple corer that I got when my Grandmother died. It was getting dull and because it was flat across the top it was a nuisance to use when making more than one pie. I saw this Oxo unit with the nice offset and I bought it. What a piece of junk. The cutting blades are dull and all it does is leave the core and apple slices attached to a web of uncut apple skin on the cutting board. Unfortunately, I didn't use the item until recently when the apples ripened. Therefore I can't return it. Anyone who is happy with this thing got a different one than I did or doesn't know what a good one is supposed to do. It's back to the knuckle-rapping antique for me - at least it cuts. I tossed this piece of junk in the trash a week ago. At least that action had a satisfying feel to it. JUNK. Also,I'm a chef, so I've used hundreds of kitchen tools and gadgets. This is one of the worst. DON'T BUY THIS JUNK. GO TO WALMART."
3,a bit pricey,Works fine but a bit expensive so I'm only giving it 3 stars. I got it because I had a just a few dollars left on a gift certificate and we needed a corer. Otherwise I would have gotten a much cheaper brand.
1,Oxo mango corer,Save your money! As a long time mango lover I was happy to see this product. After several tries I am no longer happy. If you have a stringy mango it is impossible to cut. If you have a nice firm mango it is hard to cut. It just does not work as it is cumbersome and one is unable to press down on the fruit itself to get it through the cutter. I do not recommend buying the mango corer. (The picture of the apple corer is not the product reviewed)
3,It was working great..until it broke,"I don't know if I have really tough apples or what the deal is, but this thing was working very nicely until it broke. Surprisingly it only broke after about 10 apples or so. The inner metal part disconnected from the center ring and once of those metal ""spokes"" disconnects the whole thing stops working. The actual plastic handle was extremely sturdy and the metal parts seemed sturdy until it broke. I've had it for about a month, it's possible that I could get a new one due to some kind of warranty but at $12 what's the point, I'll just go to Walmart and pick one up for $5. I spent a few extra bucks on this one hoping it would be higher quality, but it's not."
1,not very sharp,"This was not sharp all the way around, so when you press down it didn't work. It could be I got a defective one. I returned it."
4,Apple Corer and Divider,"This product works pretty well. I like the rubber handles, and the fact that they are a bit raised so you can push this all the way down without ramming your knuckles into the plate, counter, etc.However, I did dock a star because no matter how hard I try this won't divide the slices all the way - they stay connected at the bottom. It's also a bit tough to get the core out of the middle after making the cut."
2,Does not cut all the way through the apple!,This item is very sharp and built with good materials. The only flaw is that it does not cut all the way through the apple. It stops just before making the clean cut. You have the pull the core and apple slices apart.
2,Mine broke.,I loved using this item to cut apples for our school lunch boxes. But it broke after about a dozen uses; maybe the apple was a little harder.
5,Sturdy Apple Corer,Needed an apple corer/divider since my all-metal one was confiscated by my daughter. The others I bought since all broke after a few uses. This one so far has been sturdy and will cut even the hardest apple with ease.
3,It's just ok. Plain and simple,"I've had this corer/divider for a few years now and it's okay, not horrible, but not great either. The problem is that I've had to replace this thing a few times because OXO is too cheap to make this out of sturdy plastic and it will crack. I only hand wash it and it cracked under almost no pressure. I also found I had to select my apples with the corer/divider in mind, picking only the straightest apples and not the apples that looked the best...Then I purchased a metal one of these devices made by another manufacturer, you don't know what you're missing. The metal ones can handle any apple and handle it effortlessly. Save your money and get an all metal one."
4,Smooth as Silk,I recently bought this on Amazon. It works great. Pressed down on the apple and bam. The core was gone and the apple was neatly divided. The divided apple looked like a flower blossom. Pushing down on the the corer/divider did not require much pressure. It cut and sliced through the apple as smooth as silk. Be careful when washing this tool as the blades are a bit sharp. Good product. Enjoy your apples.
4,"Nice, but my first one cracked!","This is a great apple slicer/corer. We used it often to slice apples for our little ones and perhaps should not have put it in the dishwasher? Because it cracked within 3 months of everyday use - but was cheerfully replaced at the store we bought it from. (we bought it locally, not through Amazon)"
3,"Good, but not great","In general, I like this corer. It pushes easily through apples and cuts them neatly. However, I usually then have to go over all the pieces and remove the small amount of residual core left on the slices. I guess this is common with most corers? I don't know, since this is the only one I've ever owned.Another feature which turns out to be very annoying is that it cuts the apples into extremely thick slices. Most recipes I've used call for slices about half the thickness, so I have to re-slice everything.Despite all this, I still like the corer because I hate coring apples by hand and this does do the initial task very quickly and painlessly. Also, an apple halfway sliced is still better than one not sliced at all."
4,Oxo Good Grips Apple Corer and Divider,"I love this! It is so easy to use and cuts through apples like butter! I have never had one before, however my daughter loves cut up apples and this beats coring by hand."
4,Good Grips Apple Corer and Divider,Works great feels sturdy. No problems with shipping or divider. Grips are nice and confortable. East to use dividing the apple into equal parts. Only trick is lining up the center of the apple.
4,OXO Good Grips Apple Corer,Excellent as are all the Good Grips products. This one is comfortable to use even for someone like me with arthritis. Recommend
2,Will Not Last - use only on small apples,I was expecting better quality from an OXO product but the plastic on this product was not up to the task. It did last a bit longer than another plastic corer and divider I used. I am moving on to an all-metal one that can also handle larger apples than the OXO.
2,"After a year, the plastic is cracking","I find these apple slicers a bit hard to use in general but after a year, the plastic is cracking on the frame. Tough to use with hard apples like Granny Smith"
3,Good while it lasted,"This tool is _almost_ perfect, from the comfortable grips to the well honed blades. Unfortunately, the plastic body is simply not durable enough. After about 6 months, the plastic cracked beyond repair.If Oxo would replace the plastic body with one of metal, I'd buy another, even at twice the price."
3,Not all that durable,"Our family eats a lot of apples and pears. We have gone through a number of apple slicers. Initially we had an OXO - which is sharp, but the handle broke off pretty quickly. Next, I got an all metal one, but it wasn't very sharp. So, I went back to OXO. It worked fairly well for about a year. It is sharp, but the plastic parts began getting cracks pretty quickly. We still used it until the other day a handle broke off while I was using it. The sharp plastic piece cut my hand open and it hurt like crazy. I won't be buying this one again."
3,"Excellent, until it breaks.","I have just ordered one of these, and it will be my third. The previous two broke in exactly the same way - the plastic ring around the outside split, making the steel area in the middle loose. I do love the way this does one thing, and in a great way, but I am annoyed at how non-durable it has proven to been. I am actually buying this one with the expectation that I will have to replace within one or two years, which is not my expectation with other OXO products."
2,not worth buying,"ok so i bought this for my dad, since he cooks all the time. This product was very hard to use :( its so much easier to just cut an apple into slices, rather than having to try and use this difficult contraption. (it took forever to push it down all the way, and even when i finally got it, it didn't cut all the way through). dont waste your money!"
3,"Sturdy, but not what I expected.","The corer is very sturdy and easy to use, but I didn't realize it would cut the sections so large. I need to cut them again by hand for pies, but the large pieces are great for applesauce."
1,It doesn't really cut apples.,It cuts the apple but it doesn't cut all the way through it. I really dislike this corer. I wish I never bought it.
3,Works but is not durable,I have had 2 of these in 6 years. Work like a charm. Problem is that the white plastic ring cracks and eventually breaks. I would gladly pay 50% more for the same design if it would last longer.
5,great,works great- still going strong no rust after 2 years. I'm oxo obsessed so i would highly recommend this. 5 stars
3,"Good, but the Zyliss is Better","I used both and I much preferred theZyliss Apple Divider. It just seemed to feel better in the hand and to do the cutting motion smoothly and without any hesitation whatsoever. I was perfectly happy with the OXO, but now that I've tried both I much prefer the Zyliss. At the time of this writing, it's slightly less expensive, as well."
4,Makes Apple Eating Easy,"Every family with kids needs the OXO Good Grips Apple Corer/Divider because it does quick work of slicing whole apples into bite-sized pieces for after-school snacking. Safe for kids to use, too. You get a sturdy slice no matter what size of apple you are slicing and coring. Easy to operate, easy clean-up."
5,An excellent small gift,"This Oxo apple corer and divider quickly takes an apple and turns it into a handy set of pieces without the core, ready to be thrown into a lunch box or added to cereal or salad.All Oxo kitchen gadgets have handles that are pleasing to hold, and the gadget is always sturdy. I've taken these along as gifts when staying with friends, and they are always appreciated.You need a little bit of hand/arm strength to do this, so it's not for the arthritic."
5,I was there!,"I attended this concert at Auburn Hills, MI. The tickets were a birthday present. Since I was too young to be allowed to see GFR during the first time around, this was especially a treat.I was overwhelmed by the energy and musicianship of the original line-up. This was a wonderful concert and this live release does the performance justice.Since the original group no longer tours together, I feel very lucky to have seen them in this incarnation. Enjoy!!"
3,"Fun album, but GFR sounds like a nostalgia act","Hmm...no new songs, nothing from any of the band's lesser-selling albums, no risky arrangements. Yup, this is a nostalgia act, allright. And the pedestrian, ho-hum production of Ron Nevison is no help."
3,"This ain't no ""box set""...","...it's a reunion live album--seems to me that would be enough of a drawing card in and of itself. A box set is a batch of known and rare studio material, single b-sides you hadn't heard until now because you don't buy singles, yadda-yadda, a little live stuff, and (are you ready?) at least three discs. That's the trouble with today's marketing habit of calling anything over one disc a ""box set"" the way the TV networks call a two-part movie a ""miniseries""--it makes the customer jump to all sorts of conclusions about content. I hope the upcoming ""Thirty Years"" set turns out to be a righteous box set."
2,"I know they're getting old, but geez......","Mark, Don,and Mel must all have brain tumors, or they were influenced by the ridiculous Who reunion tours. I mean, an orchestra, what the hell are you guys thinking? What next, a 50 piece choir? How bout some tap dancers? Grand Funk are at best a power trio, and just compare Bosnia to Live Album and tell me which one is the real McCoy. Ok, they're older, but still....just listen to Lemmy in Motorhead proves you can still rock."
5,Disney,I've been playing music since '67 there has been a lot of reunion CD's but not very many actually live up to their billing. If you've been disappointed before let me tell you this.As a musician I've always loved GFR. I bought this CD sight unseen for twice the price and I can tell you it was a deal. These guy after all these years continue to amaze me. I have played this CD for so many people and everyone without exception tell me they have to have it in their collection.You can't go wrong if you love good R & R you need to buy this one. You will not be disappointed. This one really is a Collectors Item.
4,An excellent history book for children.,This book is one of a series of discovery books for children. It has large text for easy reading and is also well sprinkled with descriptive drawings. It brings to life the facinating story of the indian girl who lead Louis and Clark on a dangerous journey to explore the American West.It's a book that will surely intrique interest in the young reader. It's truly a pity that these books are now out of print. Children need to read the stories of history to truly appreciate their heritage.
1,"beautiful, but broken","I was really excited to order this item, but it arrived broken. Amazon was great when I reported this and was prompt to replace it. The replacement was also broken upon arrival. Amazon refunded my money."
3,Good but sedate,"I agree in principle with much of what has already been said by other reviewers of ""Tracks"", however, I wish to signal a note of caution. If you are looking at this album to be a solo performance along the lines of Oscar's Pablo ""Solo - live"", then be aware that the pace of his playing is very much subdued when compared with ""Solo"", or much of his trios, and other work. The album starts off in a reasonably ""active"" state, but as the tracks progress they become far more sedate, to the piont of almost being useful as meditation music.This is not to say that ""Tracks"" is not a good album. Oscar does show flashes of his brilliance, and the recording quality is high. Just think of this album as a quickly running stream that empties into a quiet, peaceful lake, and you should have a good feel for what you will be getting if you buy it."
4,King Pleasure Sang With A Mad Catchiness...,"king pleasure was the smoothest. he was a vocalist who's sound was part eddie jefferson, part jon hendrick's, and part nat king cole. swinging, hip and very laid back. on golden days, his backing band swings through a number of cool compositions, that all start off loud and quick and then slickly move to the background as pleasure starts singing. the track ""moody's mood for love"" is why i decided to track down some of king pleasures releases. it's a catchy tune. the song features a unaccredited female singer that switches choruses with pleasure. ""parker's mood"" is also included on this release, which features a smooth sax solo played by harold land, and which strangely reminds me of some of the modern swinging vocal bands in both sound and phrasing (i.e., the mighty blue kings)."
4,Last time I saw King Pleasure,"I've been a King Pleasure fan for years. Unfortunately the last time I saw him was in New York City. He was on the street, panhandling. One of the great scat singers."
5,eddie jefferson,"i am trying to find a cd or tape where eddie jefferson did a tune call last time i saw jeanne. i believe parkers mood was on the same cut.i have always been a fan of eddie jefferson. can you help me find the cd or tape with ""jeanne"" on it ?thank youbill wilkins"
1,They fall apart,"I bought these shades for my family room because they were so much more attractive than the other shades I could find. I've only had them up for about 6 months and they are falling to pieces. The cords run through flimsy plastic rings on the back of the shade. So far 4 of the rings have broken. I've had to repair them by attaching safety pins to the back and running the cord through them. Also, one of the clasps holding the cord in place failed within the first couple of weeks (used a safety pin for that one too). I'm running out of safety pins and patience. I wish I had saved my money."
1,damaged goods,"Brush arrived in damaged condition. Contacted supplier who responded with vague comment, but did not send replacement or suggest method for doing so. Very unsatisfactory outcome, and calls into question Amazon's quality control of suppliers. Sincerely, Cal Brown."
3,Just okay.,"I bought this brush as well as the Oxo Good Grips Soft Grip vegetable brushVegetable Brush - Soft GripI like the latter much better. This natural bristles are just too ""soft"" for my taste. I suppose this brush might be better for cleaning softer items, like mushrooms. But I find I usually grab the other one..."
3,Okay item!,I have a couple of different styles of veggie brushes and I do find this item useful in certain situations
5,Veggie Brush,"I had an old brush, which was nearly worn out. This brush in good quality, and easy to hold (especially with arthritis). I bought brushes for other family members as well."
4,Man What a Movie... Such Great Dialogue,"I really loved the Prof. Character.. The always witty banter between the Prof. and his boy assistant... Here's a good example, something like this:Boy Assistant: ""I saw a sign of a struggle near the river. There was blood on the ground!""Prof: ""Probably just woodchucks""Also, glad the town is in the hands of the genius chief.."
1,Yawn,"""Pickin on Garth Brooks"" is an INSTRUMENTAL collection of Garth Brooks' biggest hits. There is no vocal accompaniment. It features steel guitar, banjo, mandolin, fiddle, piano, harmonica, and percussion instruments.I bought this in the store and knew it was instrumental when I got it, but it had a cool cover and sounded kind of interesting so I got it. I was bored after the second song. The songs all sound pretty much like the regular versions without Garth's voice. I kept waiting to hear him start singing, and would then get dissapointed when I remembered he wasn't on the album. I don't know what I was thinking when I bought it but I was bored out of my mind.If you're a ""diehard"" bluegrass fan, well, I take that back...because you still probably won't enjoy this CD. It didn't really add anything new to Garth's music and some of the instruments are a little too prominent on certain tracks."
1,A tribute to the record exceutives.,"When an act makes it to the big time and they see them making hit records and money, eveyone want's in. This is a toast to the record bosses who know how to make a fast buck. However, i'd advise the record buyer to pick up a real Garth Brooks CD, ""no fences"" perhaps or ""in pieces"", or even both. Much better than this ""tribute"" album."
3,definately bluegrass,"I am a huge Garth fan and also a fan of instrumentals. This album seemed to be perfect. The only problem is that I am not much into bluegrass. I do, however, really enjoy ""the Thunder Rolls"" and ""Beaches of Cheyenne."" These tracks are nice to put on and just relax. My absolute favorite track is ""The Dance."" It is a very powerful piece that starts out slow but really becomes fast-paced at the end. It is awesome! Preview this track and you will see what I mean! As far as the other tracks are concerned, they really just arent the same without Garth's voice. Overall this album is alright but I wouldn't buy it unless you are REALLY into bluegrass."
3,Not worth the money if you already own Quark 4,"Although QuarkXpress 5.0 delivers everything its previous version offers, frankly, it doesn't offer enough in addition to these things to merit a $900 upgrade. In fact, this new version has some very serious drawbacks--namely, it is not native to OS X, meaning it has to run in the sometimes choppy ""Classic"" system. This leads to major refresh problems that can be quite a hassle. In addition, some of the things that have always bothered me about Quark--the necessity of clipping paths, making images transparent, etc.--are still there. I'm actually in the process of switching over to Adobe InDesign, which fixes all these problems AND is native to OSX. Until Quark comes out with a patch or an upgrade that will make their program native to OSX, pass on buying this upgrade, which offers little for the extremely high price."
1,Growing long in the tooth...,"Old technology being rapidly overtaking by InDesign 2.0, especially if you want to use OS X. If you are just starting in page layout, use InDesign. If you have been doing it for awhile and have a lot of documents in xpress format, byte the bullet now and convert them to InDesign. You are going to have to at some point anyway."
3,Okay for the Money,"I bought two of these and didn't install them one for a long time. When I finally did one of them had a short in the switch. I ended up buying a third so it would match and that one worked fine. Nice lights, worked great in my living corridors in my horse trailer."
3,Two big flaws...but otherwise good,"This is a nice KVM switch, very small, with built in cables, and relatively inexpensive. For many people, this would be a very good choice.EXCEPT if you use a mouse with extra side-buttons or if you use one or the other of the computers for gaming. It may just be because it has PS2 inputs and not enough channels for the information, but the side buttons on my mouse don't work through this switch.Also, the keyboard and mouse signals seem to be a little rough. This doesn't really have an effect in most computer use, but when gaming, at times holding down a key won't do anything. I have to repeatedly press the key to get it to register. It's very annoying.There doesn't seem to be any problem with video. That looks fine.This won't work for me, but it may work fine for others. Given that most of the alternatives are twice as expensive, it could be a good choice for many."
1,Way too expensive for a used book.,"When I realized that I had been charged $36 for this book, which was in used condition, I returned it immediately. Still, my credit card has not been credited with a refund and it's been almost 60 days!When I contacted them (Circle Rounder Books) about returning the book via e-mail, their response sounded snide and sarcastic. They did, however, give me their return address, letting me know that they would be charging me a 10% ""re-stocking fee""."
5,Single edge razor blades.,"The essence of the ""perfect tool"" for providing a sharp clean edge on recently painted window frames. These blades fit the holder perfectly."
5,Find the ... bucks and BUY THIS!!! This is what we...,"...used to call a ""desert island disc"". Ray opens his spirit and his life in this epic journey of thought through your own soul. This is going to be the best CD you will ever buy.After you learn these songs...go see Ray...go meet Ray...he is great to see."
2,Annoying,I love African music but this CD is not one I like. It is very repetitive. I have many African Music CD's where I recognize each song. I don't think I would ever be able to do that with this one. Nothing stands out as being any different from the the others. I suppose if you wanted to practice dancing the rumba this would give you endless rumba rhythms but for just listening they become very annoying.
1,what a waste of time,"I am a movie buff and have seen thousands of movies in my 71 years, but this film was one of the worst I have ever had the displeasure to watch. Story line is terrible. The main character seems to be either walking the streets or sitting in a diner. What a waste of acting talent!One star and that's for the actors who showed up."
2,What is going on?,"Missing substance, a lot. No rational for the storyline with the end coming years after the start. I thought the parts well played, but too disjointed to follow. The 2 is because I rented this movie with greater expectations. Is this what happens when everyone does a great job, and there is a movie in there somewhere? It just got lost."
3,"Look great, but aren't great to walk around in","I love the look, but the leather straps rub against my toes and feet and very soon I am not comfortable walking around in them. I normally love Clark brand shoes."
3,Not Too Bad,"I buy headsets very often because I'm trying to find the perfect one for voice recognition and perfect virtual surround sound/3D audio for games and movies. This one was decent. But the microphone was a little bit awkward to position, it was not very comfortable on my ears after about two hours... I wear them all day.Overall, these are pretty good for everyday use. But I don't recommend it for voice recognition or long hours of use.I am currently usingCreative Labs HS-980 Fatal1ty Professional Series MKII Gaming Headset (Black), and it is pretty decent. I don't like the detachable microphone because I'm used to them being built in, but no big deal. The top part is also a bit uncomfortable on the head. But the sound is amazing, and accuracy from the microphone is very very good."
1,Casebook Without Cases,The book is 70% hypos with open ended questions and half blank pages to write your answers. It constantly refers you to sections of the UCC but doesn't have the relevant UCC excerpts in the book or appendices - like a normal casebook. And there are only about 10 cases actually discussed in any detail. Not worth it at ANY price.
4,"A very good bookshelf system,with a very deep soundstage and imaging.","The jbl is a very good sounding speaker system...The bass is solid.The highs are open and dynamic...There is a slight lower midrange emphasis...This can appear as a slight hollowness,with a boasted upper bass range...This may not be noticeable on rock or pop,but may be heard,on light classical music...The speakers have an an excellent dynamic range..These speakers will easily produce a clean undistorted output of over 105 db,when used with a good high current amplifier,or receiver,rated for at least 100 watts clean,at 4 ohms,20 to 20,000cps unclipped...The more clean power,the better,the will sound...Most speakers are damaged by low powered receivers, that clip...These speakers are in cherry finish,with free shipping...These speakers are identical,to the black ash version,but with no free shipping...I highly recommend these speakers,when mated with a good subwoofer,4 star rated...A very good deal thank you stewart L."
4,Great ppv with some great matches,"In my opinion it was the greatest GAB ever. The best match of the night was the match between Savage and DDP. They was all over the building and both men took a beating. Another good match was The steiners vs. Harlem Heat. I personally liked the match between Ulitmo Dragon and Psychosis, Both men displayed aerial talent. The tag team title match between The outsiders and Piper & Flair was good as well. Great event!"
4,Robert Preston Does It Again,"This is a very curious and fun show. Of course, Robert Preston is the show and he is a superb Ben Franklin. The beutiful ""Look for small pleasures"" is included in the catch score. Enjoyable, particularly if you are a Robert Preston fan."
4,Wish there was a revival,"I love anything that has to do about Ben.I had the honor of playing hin in ""1776"" and would love to play him in this play."
5,Excellent Product and Service,The markers were shipped and recieved within a week and they work very well. Thank you.
2,Crushed,"It seems as if my package was crushed, the strands of stapleswere all () broken not a single full strip. Oh well they'restaples."
2,Stick with 1938,"This double disc has one stellar moment: Mary Lou Williams on ""Roll 'Em."" This is a rousing rendition of Mary's own song and it knocks 'em dead. Benny's vocal on ""I Love a Piano"" is also quirky and sweet. But the rest of the album is uninspiring and insipid.The absolute nadir is Jack Sheldon singing ""Rocky Raccoon."" I don't know what Benny was thinking having this obnoxious trombine-player from the Merv Griffin orchestra appearing on stage with him. Unbelievable.Benny also throws in a bunch on no-name singers giving pale imitations of his original vocalist, liltin' Martha Tilton. For diehard fans of Benny, you might emjoy this disc, for everyone else out there, stick with the 1938 classic concert from Carnegie Hall."
5,Great book!,"This book was written at the height of the pre-WW2 Nazi attempt to take over the Christian churches of Germany. At the time, the Nazis tried to 'do away with' as much of the Jewish origin of Christianity as possible, especially with the Old Testament (there were actual attempts to remove the Old Testament from Biblical cannon, and down played Martin Luther's reliance of the Tanak scriptures). German Lutheran professor Bronkamm then wrote extensively of Luther's absolute reliance on a Christ-centered understanding of the Old Testament, that the Old Testament cannot be done away with and still understand Luther, or follow the Christian church. This book was refused publication until after the war was over, on which time it became a basic textbook of many a Lutheran seminary. An excellent read, if one is interested in the German Church struggle, Martin Luther, or the Christian understanding of the Old Testament."
4,Beyond The Shackles,"Gripping, passionate, moving - a story of courage and hope when life presented none of the above."
5,NEW YORK SEPTET,This is James Moody's 1954/55 New York septet recording for Prestige records 8/55. James hasn't taken up the flute yet but with trumpeter Dave Burns in the band there was no need to. As on WAIL MOODY WAIL there is a long stretch out track- Jammin' with James- the track runs 11 1/2 minutes and is the blues as opposed to the other one a 32 with a bridge. James solos on tenor and alto with Burn's trumpet in the middle and then some exchanges toward the end. The shorter tracks are good too with Burn's getting in some licks and James taking the ballads himself. Eddie Jefferson sings but once here and not at all on WAIL MOODY WAIL.---- For more Dave Burns in this kind of groove see Johnny Griffin's STUDIO JAZZ PARTY.
3,"Great at first, then a hassle","I was very impressed with these scissors when I first purchased them. Then after using them on a regular basis, the red clip became annoying. More often than not, I go to cut something only to be stopped by the red clip. They have also broken on a few occassions (easy to re-assemble). They also become less sturdy over time and their cutting ability diminishes. I'm currently looking for a replacement pair."
2,poor quality and design,"These scissors came as a set with other Oxo items and while the other items (cheese grater, vegetable peeler, ice cream scoop, and jar opener) functioned as they suppose to, the scissors has become a frustrating experience. For example, the red locking clip that keeps the scissors closed (scissor is based on a spring lock system) has not functioned properly and cutting anything has become a vexing challenge."
2,I have re-evaluated my review after a year,"I bought these scissors for myself and liked them so much that I bought more for bridal showers. They make a nice gift when paired with the OXO soft handled vegetable peeler.They are easy to use, comfortable to hold and nice and sharp. The locking mechanism is handy as well. The price is very reasonable. However after a year, I am having a problem with the spring that is key to the scissors periodically falling out. I have to put the scissors down and replace it. So I have lowered my rating to 2 stars. The vegetable peeler still rates 5 stars."
3,"One annoying quirk, not super sharp; otherwise, fine!","My hands are extremely weak, inflexible and swollen because of rheumatoid arthritis. I wanted spring-loaded shears for use around the home. These have been a great set of shears for me and get lots of regular use. They have been tossed in the dishwasher plenty of times. Although these scissors don't seem to be particularly sharp, my needs for them are mainly cutting through product packaging (like cereal bags) or to poke through the tape to open an Amazon box. They don't need to be super sharp for those purposes, but I don't think they would work well for serious cutting needs. The red clip does have an annoying habit of tipping over when you least want it to, thus quite often preventing you from making the cut you want. I like that these shears can be locked with that annoying clip and stored safely in a drawer. So...they're good for my uses, but won't ""cut it"" for everyone."
1,Not up to Oxo standards,"I normally like Oxo products, but these fell apart almost immediately and I couldn't figure out how to put them back together. Complete waste of money."
2,Agree that OXO could have done better,"PROS: Cuts well enough for my kitchen use; comfortable to grip w/extra large opening for fingers and no place to get my thumb stuck as has happened w/other scissors; fairly easy to take apart/assemble for cleaning & sharpening.CONS: The locking latch flipping into the locked position during use is a major flaw; the handles come completely together so you have to be careful not to get the skin of your palm pinched (trust me, it's very painful)."
1,A disapointment,"I usually like OXO products but this one is terrible. They are awkward, not sharp, and the spring mechanism doesn't work most times. After you make one cut you have to use both hands to pull the blades apart. Useless for cutting up chicken."
1,They Come Apart,"I have never been able to use these. On the first try the two halves split apart. Unlike the previous reviewer, mine will not hold tegether long enough for use. I keep trying to fix them but to no avail. Very disappointing as the handles are well made. It's a pity they just don't work."
3,OXO may have missed on this one...,"We're big OXO enthusiasts, but we think that OXO didn't live up to its own high standards on this one.While the ergonomic deign is nice, and more comfortable on the fingers than many other scissors, it still lacks the truly comfortable grip that is OXO's hallmark.We also find that our red scissors lock sticks a bit--once locked, we've had to practially hammer it to get it to release for us.OXO is a top-notch product line and we rarely have any complaints. It's our positive experiences with other OXO products that probably contributes to our disappointment with this one. Bottom line: if you have trouble with other scissors, then by all means give these a try. But know that most OXO products are even more comfortable!"
2,Only worthwhile if you have arthritis.,"This pair of scissors is mediocre at best. I can see it's value for those with arthritic hands, with the easy to grasp, spring loaded handles.The pair I had was very poorly put together. The spring which keeps the scissors open kept dislodging and flying across the room. The nut and bolt holding the blades together would also come undone intermittently. I fixed the problem by melting the plastic around the spring, permanently fixing it into place and by tightenign the bolts.My advice is to spend a little more money and get a pair of Henckels scissors, which are much sturdier. The blades also can be separated for easy cleaning (there are no nuts and bolts to become loose either)."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I purchased these kitchen scissors based on the Oxo brand name. They worked great the first couple of times, but dulled very quickly. Also, I experienced the same problem as other reviewers, where the red latch will try to close during use. With a toddler into everything at home, I like the safety feature of the latch, but it's very awkward during use. Finally, cleaning these scissors leaves much to be desired. The blades don't come apart, so the only way to really get them clean is in the dishwasher. After about three washes, I noticed some rust spots on the blades! I'm going to follow the advice of other reviewers, and spend a little extra money for a better product."
3,Nice but takes two hands to use,"Strong, sharp and nice to handle. Too bad the Oxo people didn't take a cue from gardening shears & make these so that you can open and lock them with one hand. Having to use two hands to open and close these scissors is a real annoyance."
4,good intro to Scientology,this is a good read if you aren't already familiar with the concepts of Dianetics & Scientology. Would also encourage the reader to read Fundamentals of Thought and Evolution of a Science as well by L. Ron Hubbard for continued study.
5,"John P. great guitar, some new Holiday tunes","Just heard John Pizzarelli on the Boston POPS Holiday Special aired on A&E November 26, 1998. John and his trio played half of the selections on this CD and they really swing. Some old standards and a few new songs that I'm sure will become seasonal regulars (e.g. Santa is near). Very enjoyable!"
1,Not the normal quality for an OXO product,"I've had this grater for quite a while, I bought it because I normally love the OXO products. This one, however is a bad design. It has cracked in multiple areas on the white plastic sides from the pressure of pushing the item, mostly cheese in my case. I normally love OXO, but avoid this item...go with a box grater."
1,Cracked in several places - barely used,"Ours is cracked in several places after being barely used. It is extremely poor quality, I'm so surprised to see it still for sale."
1,"good idea, terrible quality",I thought this grater would be very easy to use. I really like the design of the grater and the grip on the top. It was easy to set on the side of a bowl and grate right into it. But it broke within the first two weeks of using it. The plastic cracked and broke making it impossible to use. I would not recomend buying this grater. Spend your money on something that will last.
1,Breaks quickly,"I bought one of these, thinking that the price is pretty reasonable. I got what I paid for.When you try to slide out the grater, so that you can clean inside of the ridges that hold the two plates into place, it's awkward, because you have to align it just so, or else it won't come out. I'd toss it in the dishwasher after using it. After the first round (we don't use the drying cycle, because it costs so much electricity), it came out with multiple cracks along the side. A couple months later, the plastic underneath the fine grater broke off. That made it so that the black piece up top is absolutely useless, because now it won't rest comfortably on the table. Then, the wide side broke.I went to walmart, and got an $8 box grater. That thing is solid."
1,Weak and broken,I purchased one of these because it looked like it might save some space. It broke along the sides at the corner of the metal after only light use. Save your money and don't buy this.
2,"lousy grater, better customer service","It would have been wonderful if this grater had lasted - I really liked the idea of grating into a bowl. However, the design is such that cracks quickly develop where stress is placed on the plastic housing around the metal grate. Not only did two of mine break, but I've spotted these in thrift stores with similar breaks. The first time mine broke, I had it replaced under Oxo's lifetime warranty policy (which requires you to pay to ship your defective item back). The 2nd time, I asked to upgrade to a box grater (and I asked if I could substitute a digital photo of my broken grater, since this was my 2nd broken grater); as a goodwill gesture, customer service sent me a free box grater (which works very well) without requiring me to ship anything back or send a photo. So the grater gets 1 star and customer service 4 stars."
2,Best if you keep looking,"I normally like all of Oxo's products and this started out as a real favorite. However in less than 6 months, the plastic cracked on the side by the handle making it unsafe to use. I recommend you keep looking and not waste your money on this until they design it with considerable more durability"
1,Not worth it,"This would be a wonderful little kitchen tool if the plastic sides did not break within a few months. It is very sharp, perfect for those little grating jobs where you don't want to haul out the food processor. OXO replaced this once for me and the new one started cracking within a month. I only used it for cheddar, as noted by another reviewer and it still broke soon. I will not buy this one again and think that OXO should take it off the market."
2,Works As Promised Until It Breaks,"This grates well, stores well, disassembles for easy cleaning, and is dishwasher safe, BUT IT BREAKS EASILY! It's made of cheap material that cracks, leaving it unsafe. I recommend buying a sturdier product. If it didn't work well in the beginning, I would've given it a one. This product inevitably breaks within a short period of time. It's not worth the purchase."
1,Way too flimsy!,"Most of the OXO products hold up but this grater broke grating cheddar cheese. After writing this review, I'm going to order an all metal grater."
1,Yes you can count on this breaking...,"I liked that it folded for storage, but -- now that the plastic has cracked -- there is no need to store it. Bad bad grater."
3,"Great grip, faulty material...","Just to add to what has already been said...I bought mine a year and a half ago, and in that time its been handy, but nowhere near as sturdy as I would have hoped. I found I couldn't grate into a bowl unless the width accomodated the legs, so more often than not I had to grate onto a cutting board and sweep the item into a bowl.And like everyone else's my grater suffers from flimsy plastic. I probably have a month left on mine before it breaks from all the cracks on the sides.On the good side, both faces of the grater worked great on hard and semi-soft cheeses, vegetables, baking chocolate and even nutmeg and ginger. I loved the fact that I could throw this into the dishwasher and forget about it.If Oxo made a stainless steel version of this, I would give it a try. Otherwise, put the money towards one that won't fracture after a while. Two stars for the design and one for the price."
5,The best Grater I have used.,"I have had this grater for about 3 years. I have used it to grate both soft and hard cheeses. It handles both equally well. The best part, however, is the comfortable handle. In the past when I used box graters after grating for more then a minute, the handle would start to hurt my hand. This does not happen with this grater."
2,Breaks too soon,"I loved my new grater for a few months -- until the plastic on one side split, meaning it no longer stands up on its own, and the broken side cannot be used. What a pity it wasn't more sturdy! All I ever grated with it was cheddar, so it's not as if I used it for anything too hard."
1,another good while it lasted,I too have experienced the plastic cracking and breaking. Would not buy another.
1,Lasted a couple months,This thing kept falling apart when I grated with it. It finally developed little cracks on the side that turned into big ones. Then it went kaput and snapped. The only good things about it are the non-skid rubber footings.
1,"Broken, and Bad","When we got this grater, it was nice, the grip is nice. It is hard to fit in a bowl, so we used a plate. Now the plastic has broken, the plastic is very thin, and apparently this item was not made to last. I have always thought of Oxo as being a good product, but lately several Oxo items have been junk.Do yourself a favor, and get an all metal one, with no plastic to break."
2,"Loved it, but...","I bought my grater because I have always liked other OXO products - but I was disappointed. I was never able to actually take the thing apart for the so-called ""easy cleaning,"" and it broke very quickly. I think I had it for a year before it started cracking (with low usage - maybe used 20 times. Maybe.) When it did work, it grated well. But I returned it and got an old-fashioned box grater instead. I'm much happier with that, knowing that the stainless steel will not break anytime in the near future!"
2,ok until it breaks is right!,Mine did break too. I ended up buying a box grater soon after I bought this one. When I did use it I was more worried about cutting my self because it was so unstable. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this product!
3,Flimsy plastic grater,"Easy to use, has non-slip bottom edges, comfortable handle. BUT...the plastic frame is weak and fractures easily! The plastic frame needs to be thicker/sturdy material! Other than this, I love working with this grater (compared to other models) since it stores flat and is very easy to clean!"
1,World's worst cheese grater,"DO NOT BUY THIS. It breaks in 4 places on the large hole shredder side even with light pressure and soft cheeses like brie. Only moderately hard cheeses like cheddar or moderate pressure will breaks it after very little use, as mine did, and which I had to repair with super-glue. The plastic is poor quality (i.e., too weak for intended use and this design) and the design is faulty (too little plastic aroun each metal shred grid). Best to buy an old style handle-at-top all-metal one at thrift store or Goodwill rather than this extemely poor product. A complete waste of money and time, in repairs. OXO usually makes fine products. This is not one of them."
1,Fails the test,"My wife and I have had very good experiences with OXO products, and after handling this grater in a store we expected to continue that experience.However, after a very short period of use (we use a grater every day for grating cheese - both hard and firm - for personal use) the plastic frame began to crack and disintegrate, rendering the grater useless."
1,OXO is slacking,"I am usually a fan of OXO products but I have noticed lately that they are not as good as they used to be with shoddy execution or questionable workmanship. I, like everyone else, was hoping this would be the solution to my storage issues with graters but it proved useless less than a year later and with little use to stress the thing out (almond paste and cheddar cheese were the only things I used it for). It developed cracks in the plastic that are impossible to repair. Also, I do not think this is a good grater for the supposed market of arthritic people - it can be difficult to put together.So, in short, it stinks for those suffering pain in their hands and for those who cook. Save your money and just buy a KitchenAid grater."
1,It broke in a month,"I have enjoyed OXO products in the past, so when my last grater failed, I decided to try the OXO grater. Unfortunately, the plastic broke in less than a month. It was also a bit clumsy to use. Why aren't there more choices made entirely of stainless steel, in easy to store shapes?"
2,Worked well for a while...,"This grater was nice, but it is not constructed well. The plastic housing around the metal graters cracked within a year of minimal use. It was difficult to clean. And as others have said, it would have been better if it spread wider than it does. I typically love OXO products, but I have replaced this one with a solid steel grater. If you're looking for a grater that will last, look elsewhere."
3,Very easy to clean,Most box gaters are at best difficult to clean. Because this grater completely disassembles cleaning is a snap. The other reviewers are correct in stating that the plasitic cracks easily but you should handle it gently to minimize this fault. I would buy another just to be able to clean it so well and I would encourage OXO to strengthen the design.
1,CAUTION! DO NOT BUY!!,"I put this grater on my wedding registry because I liked the fold-up, space-saving, and ergo-friendly design. BIG MISTAKE! Where do I begin? First, it tries to fold up while you're grating cheese, which is downright annoying, so I started using it unassembled, which worked for a very short while until it cracked (about the 5th time I used it). Then it cracked more. And more. And more, until all that was left was the metal grating plate. Even though it hurts to hold it while grating, and it's highly inconvenient, I've been using it this way for 4 years now, since I refuse to buy a new grater until I'm sure I find one that won't fall apart like this one. And because, believe it or not, the metal grater itself, is really perfect. I just wish they'd found a housing for it that actually works!"
1,"cheap material, breaks easily","I was disappointed that this grater only lasted for a couple of weeks. At first it broke into two pieces, so I could only use one half (even when it stood upright as pictured, it never did stay open or grip the counter- it was never stable, and either closed or fell down while grating). Then I was left with a flat grater that was difficult to use. The piece that was left cracked on the corners, and broke apart within a couple of uses. Usually Oxo makes great products. This is not a good product. Save your money and buy a different model grater. You will be happier with an all metal model for sure!"
