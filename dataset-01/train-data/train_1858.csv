3,Save your money!,"I bought one of these because it was the first one I saw and I wanted a little more capacity than the one that came with my Olympus D360L. I thought the price was high but I only have to buy it once, right? Well now I find that there are other brands for half the price. Check around. A company called Smartdisk makes these and sells them to other companies. Can you say "" cut out the middle man"" boys and girls? The card works great and I have had zero problems."
3,Is it or isn't it?,"An amusing story, something like a cross between Alan Dean Foster's Spellsinger and Douglas Adams' Hitchhhiker's Guide series, and likely to appeal to fans of these series. Bernice and her cat, arguably the two main characters, were engaging characters that were fun to read about. A lot of cliches from classic tales are used here in twisted and surprising ways. A very funny story.But there were enough problems to keep me from giving it a higher rating than I did. There were too many other characters that were interesting but inadequately developed. The plot was rather chaotic, taking turns seemingly at random. It struck me as the sort of story that could have been developed from one of those creativity exercises where you are given several unusual, diverse objects or characters, and you are supposed to conjure up a story that uses all of them.You could certainly do worse than to read Paul Cornell's Oh No, It Isn't."
3,"So, YOU wanna know about Down River eh?","I gave this book 3 stars because some of the things the characters did were believable, but some were not. Like when Troy threw away the map-that was believable, but when a group of ""escapees"" use such clean language while they are being hunted down under so much stress, I thought that was kind of out of place."
3,Downrver,"I am a 8th grade salt lake city Utah reader.I enjoyed this book for the most part, i liked it because,it has action, humor and drama all in one. It was fun to learn about river rafting and the Grand Canyon. I also liked it because it was so unpredictable. The group of teenagers would come up on a question and you didn't really know what or how they would answer. I think this book would be good for someone ready to try new things. This book would also be good for someone that like to run away from everyone and every thing for a while. In closing I liked this book and would recommend it to anyone. Thanks for reading! ()"
4,A Pretty Cool Book,"In my opinion it was a pretty good book. I thought it was cool. It dragged on a bit in the middle, and that's why I didn't give it the whole amount of points. I was able to relate to a couple of the characters though. The author was able to make the people actually seem real; not to many authors know how to do that. I was impressed, and I would recomend this book to anyone who likes to read."
2,jumping for jumping jacks,I am in 8th grade and my class just got done reading Downriver a week ago. I thougt it was a good book. but there was some slow parts in it. and there was some exciting parts. If you like reiver rafting you will definetly like this book. But if you don't you might not like it as much.
5,GIT ER DUN,"The book, Downriver, by Will Hobbs is an excellent book for any young adult reader. It contains many twists and edge of the seat experiences that keep the reader turning pages. Each moment is filled with a magnetism that keeps the reader hooked.A group of kids who are on a discovery program, to find strength within them selves, find an adventure of a lifetime. They devise a plan to ""borrow"" the van and rafting equipment. They soon find themselves rafting the perilous Grand Canyon. They set down the river with good times in mind but, control issues and a very persuasive leader make the trip go awry.The excitement is as high as the rapids. The plot flows quickly and never lets up. It is an excellent book for anybody interested in adventurous teens."
3,Cool,"I am an 8th grade student. I liked Downriver because it wasadventurous and exciting. One thing I didn't like was, they neverexplained how Jessie and Star got together. I recommend this book tothose who like books that make you think or someone who wants to know about the Grand Canyon. END"
5,Very exciting,"i loved this book. We read it in class and every time we had to stop, I got mad because I want to go on and read the exciting part. I liked it because it was realistic. I felt that the people in it were real. I felt the emotions the characters felt and go into it. I do recomend this book to most of you, I have not read the second part which is known as ""River Thunder"" and I would like to read it. (with the class.)"
5,F-U-N,"A 8th grade reader from Utah I thought this book was great, I usually hate reading, but I LOVED this book, the way the Author explained it was Amazing, we read it in my 2nd period class, and I used to sit there in 1st, board out of my mind, just waiting to go to 2nd so I can read ""Down River""."
5,GREAT READ FOR ALL AGES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When I got this book I thought it was just another book I could read when I got bored. But when I started reading it I couldn't stop. The characters are very interesting and all of the are VERY different. They are all at a program called ""Discovery Unlimited"" because they have gotten in trouble with the law somehow. The program is suposed to boost their confidence so they do not get in even more trouble. So on their way to the San Juan River they steal their leader's truck and gear and go to the Grand Canyon. When they get there have have some crazy adventures and run into some trouble with the law.Overall this is a great book for all ages and I recommend it to anyone who needs something to read."
4,Teacher Recommendation,"As a teacher, I find this book very useful. I teach basic English at a public high school, and I read this book with my sophomores every year.Although it is certainly not great literature, and it is not likely to be remembered fifty years from now, Will Hobbs is a talented writer whose strengths include creating interesting characters with depth, using imagery to bring readers into the setting, and using foreshadowing as a tool to generate interest and suspense.Even readers who say they don't like to read enjoy this book. Both male and female readers tend to enjoy this book equally, and I receive many requests to read its sequel, _River Thunder_, which is fairly decent itself, though not quite up to the quality of _Downriver_."
5,amazing,"this is one of the best books i have ever read. when i held it up, i never put it down until was done with it"
4,matty's review,down river was a book that kept the reader on the edge of their seat and threw something different at you every time you turned the page. the part of the book when the kids were traveling through the canyon was especially interesting to me because I am an outdoorsman and the detail that the scenes were described made it very easy to relate to what the characters were going through.
4,Downriver,Downriver is a great book. It was about a group of teens that ditched their outdoor education program to go river rafting. Jessie and some other friends of hers used borrowed equipment to explore the Grand Canyon's roaring rapids. When they went to go river rafting they had no adults and no river map.I decided to read Downriver because my brother read this book and he highly recommended it to me. He thought I would enjoy this book because i like any book that is adventerous and wild. I also read some book reviews on line and it seems to have high review comments. Most of the comments said that Downriver was a very good book to read so I decide to read it for my self.My favorite part of the book was when Jessie went back to the camp and the first thing she did was to go look in the mirror. I would have never guessed that she would visit the mirror first. Insetad I whould have just taken a shower and forget about the mirror. I also thought it was sort of funny too.
2,Fast and Unanswered Questions,"When reading the first chapters of the book, it seemed to be that the author was introducing characters in the most boring and overused way any author has done. Having a character do something either special or meant for their nature, and slowly introducing them saying either ""he likes to do this"" or ""she likes her friends because"". And frankly, the book doesn't seem that exciting with an introduction that seems to drag on and not seem to give that more of a deep backstory to any of the characters. The story was gradually getting better as time went on, but at the slowest pace possible. Because of this slow pace, anyone would be yawning and getting bored of the book at this point. After finishing the book, I can honestly say that it was an unrealistic happily ever after that left many questions unanswered. But with what I had read, it wouldn't be worth reading a sequel to find out any of those answers."
4,Entertainment,I bought this book for a student who couldn't afford it and needed it for class. So I don't know much about it other than it came fast and saved his grade.
2,sorry,I am 14 years old. The book was ok. I didn't really like it but after reading it I have some questions and want to know more about what they are talking about. So I want to go rever running. I think that I would not read it agian or recommend it to others.
4,Personel #4,"This is a good book.I really liked it, but it got boring on certain parts but I still think it is a readable book for all ages and that to read in a class.It is a great book so I would choose yes."
4,The hoods in the woods,"I'm in the 8th grade and I had to read this book. I thought this book is fun and adventurious. It was good becauuse a good perspective of teenagers lives being mest up and horrible, they start to work as a group at the end. Awesome Book"
2,Downriver,"Compared to other books I think Down River wasnt really good. I didnt like it because it wasnat my kind of book. I don't like books that is about adventure. When i read book that aren't interesting, I don't usually understand them.The main character is Jessie. There are 7 other people. There is Pug, Star, Rite, Freddy, Troy, Adam, and Al. At the end of the book it doesn't tell what happened to them.I would mostly recommend this book to people that like rafting, camping, or a lot of adventure. If you don't like adventure you would like this book. I didnt like it cause it talks about these entire river and i had no clue what they were."
4,Downriver,"Some teens in a troop named ""Discovery Unlimted""{nick named hoods in the woods} take some rafts from their group leader Al. Now Troy, Jessie, Pug, Rita, Star, Adam, and Freddy are taking a trip down the Grand Canyon without a map or anybody to help them. They are hoping to get through the white water rapids alive without being stopped by the police. Will they live or perish in the deadly river? Find out in ""Downriver""."
2,This book was boring.,"I rate this book {Downriver}a 3 for a few reasons. One reason is because it is hard to understand. It is not well explained. Another reason is because it does not have a lot of action. And when it does have action it focuses too much on one character. Then when you go to another character, you jump right into him/her and it gets very confusing."
2,mis-labeled and flimsy.,"I purchased these blinds for a deep, loft-style window. Unfortunately, while they are described as three-feet by six-feet, they were only 30 inches wide. The mounting hardware also seems extremely insubstantial. Not pleased with this product."
3,Too Light in Color,"The image provided does not indicate the color well enough.The product that arrived was bleach-white ivory and did not match what I needed to replace.The product is likely a decent one, just not what I needed."
4,Vintage Amanda Quick,Amanda Quick's Regency England has life and people of its own. This book has all the classic elements and the standard characters of a novel by Quick set in that era. A great book if you have liked the others by this author.
1,Missthis???,Perhaps I'm burned out on Amanda Quick novels. This stank like bad fish. The characters were carbon coppies of all her previous novels but without all the nice touches. Maybe I am being hard on this book. But I couldn't finish it. after the scene where marcus and that girl meet I was really turned off. The dialogue was just too formal and stiff. Formal maybe good but stiff and strained is not. The characters were boring and I had the been there done that feeling all while I read it. I found myself skipping all discription and just reading the dialogue because the pace was so slow. But the dialogue was no better. Finally I (...) cut to the chase. Only there was no chase. Just more of the same pointless mindless dialogue.I usually like Amanda Quick. Sometimes her stories really hit the spot. Not this one. It was a wall banger. Did I mention the whole premis is weak? I just couldn't suspend disbelief for this one. So I tossed it for a julie garwood.Like I said Mistress? Miss this!!
4,Entertaining,"I have read several Krentz/Quick novels, and although they seem fairly repetative (headstrong, virginal woman; remote, masterful, harshly handsome hero), this one stood out. for those who liked this, I recommend ""Trust Me""...it's a modern book under the Krentz name, but it shares many of the same themes."
3,outdated,Book is now outdated. Is a good reference or starting point for the novice. Good introduction to where things have come from... Things have changed quite a bit since publication as they tend to do on the net.
3,Book is O.K.,"This book was O.K. There were many ideas to choose from but only a few good ones. Plus, there isn't much information on each business. You could find more ideas and a lot more information for free on the Internet."
1,Worthless,"It took 70 minutes to read this book and it was a complete waste of time. Basically the book's advice is create a website and get people to pay you somehow. The big ideas are literally to sell something and the author hilariously give each thing it's own category like #20 SELL BOOKS and #44 SELL ART SUPPLIES! and #14 SELL BEAUTY SUPPLIES. Those are not different business ideas. Also, most of the ~~business~~ ideas are NOT internet business ideas they are normal businesses such as cleaning services, event planning, PR firms and numerous others that may ALSO benefit from having a website. But they cannot exist solely on the internet and would need a specialized skill set and the ability to go out and get the clients.The book is also annoying to read because it is repetitive, redundant and insultingly simple. It was written for idiots. I'm not an idiot so I found nothing of value in it. I don't recommend this book at all."
1,Rifle arrived damaged due to manufacturer not shipper,The rifle arrived damaged. The tip of the rifle had a long crack. It was packed damaged and should never have been sent.
5,Excellent book!,This book is VERY interesting. It tells the story of this young boy who is captured by the north Africa pirates and made a slave of the sultan in Morocco. I really recommend it!
5,amazing,I learned quite so much from this book. I was completely unaware of this part of the history of slavery.
2,"Spend the bit extra for Zoomers, or Speedo.","I suppose the price looks good compared to Zoomers, or Speedo, but it's an illusion: the hard plastic used to make the blade more rigid is NOT flexible and will show stress cracks if(when) bent. These fins are for pool and not open water, so all but the most careful adults will show white lines and stress fractures immediately. My 10yr old is a swimmer and after 20mins of testing the fins out(while I WATCHED), he emerged with a couple white stress fractures on each fin blade. My wife and I have Zoomers(market dominators, understandably) and I wish to Heaven that I had opted for them in THIS case."
1,Cracked after 2 weeks,Bought these for my son who is a competitive swimmer - he trains 1.5 hrs/day. These fins did not hold up - they cracked and completely fell apart within two weeks of training. Have returned and will try the Speedo Biofuse.
1,Fell apart after 3 uses,"My 12 year old out grew her Finis Zoomers so I saved a few bucks and bought these. Fell apart after three uses. The hard plastic near the toes permanently bent and separated from the softer rubber around the toes. Terrible design. Now I have to go buy zoomers again. Bit more pricey, but they last. One piece design (no glued joints) and I've had mine for 3 years. Teach me to try and save a few bucks."
1,Cracked and useless after only 5 months use!,"Keep you money - these suck, fins broke after only 5 months of 2 x week, 1 hour per time swimming in the pool for exercise. Very sad as I have had these in the past and they lasted years - I think the old fins were made in Italy, now these are made in China."
4,A one of a kind game setting!!!,"I am tired of people bad mouthing Wormwood. As a SEPERATE DIMENTION it should be considered only loosely assosiated with the main rifts story line. That said, its story of desperate people holding out against the hordes of demons who hold sway over 60% of the planet sets a great parallel to rifts earth ( as in a "" see what could happen to us "" kind of situation. ) It may contain ""weaker"" occ's littel in the way of advanced weapons and strange settings but offers so much story for a GM to expound from . Point is this setting has twice the potential of nearly any other."
3,needs work,"this book really needs work! while characters are easy to create, they usually get majorly hurt as soon as they meet a challenge. very inconsistent."
1,poorly done and sloppy,"This sourcebook was published during a sort of dry spell for Palladium. In my opinion, it is the most poorly conceived Rifts sourcebook ever published. The book is riddled with inconsistencies and errors. One example is that all characters start with useless and almost unobtainable equipment. For those familiar with the Rifts system, all characters carry sdc weapons and tools on a world where everything/everyone is a mega-damage structure (even normal buildings/people). Wooden stakes (sdc only weapon useful only against vampires) are commonly carried on a world where any wood must be imported from another dimension (no trees on Wormwood). There are no vampires on Wormwood (stated specifically in the book). To make things even sillier, people are mdc structures but do not do deal out mega-damage themselves (no fist fights i guess). If you are looking for a good Rifts supplement...look elsewhere"
4,Looks cool,"I have not yet gotten this unit, but am seriously considering it seeing as how Amazon gives you $40 off the retail price. My only gripes from looking at it are that the silver does not look nearly as cool as the black model that most other places sell, and the fact that there are NO s-video inputs on the back. This is going to frustrate me, seeing as how lots of my stuff uses S-video. Anyone actually use this with video hooked up? how does it look?"
2,Hope you don't need warranty repair,"The best sounding receiver I've ever owned - that is until it began changing the settings I programmed in by itself. The repair depot (third party) doesn't have a clue. They've had it for a month. According to them there is no problem. I reset and reprogrammed the receiver several times but it always changed the settings. Beware the Yamaha Warranty! If you don't have to use it you're fortunate. This morning I told them to return the unit. I'll replace it with something else with a solid warranty; perhaps an exchange agreement. If these made in China, hot running receivers crap out it's unlikely that they can be repaired. Replacement is the ONLY option. A receiver lasts me about two years on the average."
2,Avoid this one,"Nice looking receiver, good sound for the money, but absolutely nightmare to program. You can not tune to next station without manual!!! Once you save your favorite stations you are stuck with them, unless you want to spend another afternoon cursing over manual.Please avoid..."
5,the best yet,I saw this at the store and hoping to get it in 3 months my other reciever caught on fire and was a 19 year old YAMAHA RX-900U
1,inaccurate description,"Description says '25 sets."" There are only 5 sets in the box. So the ad is, to say the least, misleading."
3,"The ""Shakespearian"" version of Frankenstein","The actors were good, The gore was good, the lines where good, the picture and sound was good, but this movie was just a little too long winded and waaaaaaay tooooooo slooowwwww. ZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzz god, it was like watching paint dry. Some memorable scenes mixed in with a lot of boring scenes. Worth a rental though."
5,Most faithful to Shelley,"As others have said here, this is absolutely the most faithful version to the original Mary Shelley book ever put on film. There was, however, one previous version that also follows the book very closely, and was actually the most faithful until the present version. It's an obscure Irish / Swedish co-production made in 1975, originally titled ""Victor Frankenstein"" but on video as ""Terror of Frankenstein"". It's well worth checking out."
4,Frankenstein as Mary Shelley wrote it (almost),"It's a little on the long side and the creature isn't quite as wrathful as Mary Shelley's, but this movie comes far, far closer to the book than any yet produced. Much of the dialogue is word-for-word identical.Why hasn't the real story of Frankenstein enjoyed the theatrical success of its knockoff versions? Viewers have been reluctant to embrace a monster who is more intelligent and morally aware than Dr. Frankenstein himself--who feels deeply the crisis of his imperfect creation and subsequent abandonment, who compares himself at one moment to Adam and at another to Milton's Satan.This version portrays all the creature's tragedy, staged amid vivid scenery and sweeping panoramas. The naturalism, drama, and lingering suspense of Mary Shelley's classic novel all appear in this version; look for a PG-13 rating and a meager dose of the grotesque (i.e. no heart ripping) in this production."
1,Not at all great:(,"No, no it came on time nothing wrong with the service @ all!! The movie it self was a sleeper:("
4,well done,"This tale has been current two centuries for a reason: it's damn good. No need for embellishment or special effects. Fidelity to the narrative pays off here: in sticking to the text, the film approaches Shakespearian dimensions.Worthwhile."
3,Original Equipment Manufacturers Part Now Made in China,"Standard ignition modules are what came installed on factory vehicles. I have been replacing defective units on a truck I've owned since 1975. The first time I had a unit failing, I replaced it with a cheap knock off unit from a discount automotive store. It didn't last no time at all, in fact it had a 30 day guarantee. I have never had an outright failure with these Standard units. They signal their end with an intermittent misfire. At least Standard stands behind their unit with a 5 year, 50,000 mile warranty. To date, I always ran out of time before my unit starts to fail. I'm glad to see these available on Amazon, my local auto parts stores quit selling this unit. They sell the cheap unit and a much more expensive unit, it's less expensive here. An update, got the unit, and unfortunately, it is now made in China."
5,Love at first read,"Love at first sight is a really old convention of literature; the weaver's instant recognition of his true soul-mate requires only that he convince her to recognize his worth in turn. Mr. Brundy, the weaver of the title, is admirably suited to this delicate task, and succeeds beautifully. A charming book and a real Regency ""keeper"". Brava, Ms. Cobb!"
4,An extremely charming and clever book,"This is a little perfect gem. The author has mastered the art of fine Regency romance writing, and though the hero and heroine are both flawed, we believe their happily ever after ending.He is a decent man for all of his shortcomings in the social sense, and she, whilst behaving foolishly enough to compromise herself, is not the shrew everyone thinks her to be.(I didn't give this a 5 only because I think she should not have helped her family, and when she did, she should have told hubby the truth and saved everyone a lot of bother).Though it would have been a lot less dramatic if she had!Some really clever moments like the opera and dinner table incident and the ball and the conclusion made this book one of the best things I have read for a long time.Certainly better than what a lot of established romance writers from the big houses are churning out these days. I loved it so much I read it in one sitting. I am very much looking forward to the sequels. Well done!"
1,100 Questions Psychiatry Should Face,"I believe this book to be a total waste of money. It is written at too simplistic a level for psychology or psychiatry students. I suppose if you know nothing about the subject it could be of some use, however, if you have already taken Psych 101 at high school or college this book is of no use."
4,Fun...frustrating.,HOOBOY! General Grievous is a tough nut to crack!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!And frustrating. and those spider droids...a miracle saves me! BUY IT! because it's fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Very Dissapointed,"The last star wars movie was incredible and I was looking foward to the game. I borrowed it from my uncle and I was really excited. When I played it it was like an earthquake hit the designers' heads. The graphics are awful and looks like it came out of the garbage. The game gets really repeditive after the second level. There is no originality at all in this game which is really bad. Sure the multiplayer might be pretty good but it also gets repeditive just like the single player. On the bonus stages you get to play as different characters, but they all handle the same way. The controls are pretty good but you won't need them because all you use is the X button. Overall the game is horrible."
3,What have I done?!,"OMG!!!This game is way worse then the movie.I mean the deaths aren't even the same!And the actors don't do the voices!The only 3 good things about this are:graphics,action,new ending.Nuf said!"
1,unhappy,"This product does not work in my sons xbox...what can I do?Please help resolve or return it,sincerely katherine"
4,This game was very well made!,"I have to say that this game was fantastic! I love the way that they tied together actual videography from the movie and combined it with the gameplay. One thing I found a bit disappointing was how the game had virtually NO challenge. I beat the entire game, bonus missions and all in 5:40:02 which is extremely fast. If you are a constant gamer you know what I mean. Anyways, cut to the chase this was an AMAZING game! Hope this review helped for any wonderers."
4,"Good ""oldie""","I actually sold this game quite a few years ago, and then missed it, so bought it again. It is a good all around game. As you increase you character skills, you can actually see the difference. The cut scenes are mostly out of the movie, which is great. The only thing I don't like about the game is how you can't move the bird's eye view cam. You get shot by droids out of view all the time, and you just have to run around swinging sometimes. I still love it, though."
4,"Fun game, but a little short...","This game is super fun.... for the couple hours it takes to complete. The graphics and sound were great! There are a couple parts of the movie, however, that I wish they would have added to the game to make it a little longer. One thing about this game (which I tend to agree with another reviewer) was that after you beat the game, there really isn't much left to do. It's not a game that you can go back and do a whole lot in each level. Kind of a ""one and done"" type of game. I would recommend this game for someone looking for a low cost SW game that follows the movie, has some original scenes from the movie, and has great graphics."
4,"Loved It, But Somewhat Disturbed","I had a blast with this game. I finished it the first time through in about 7-hours so it is really short. However, I think the game is going to have alot of replay value in trying to get better scores on each of the levels and finding secrets. That being said I have a make a comment about something other than the gameplay. Maybe this is because I grew up with Star Wars being 18 when the first one came out but I was deeply disturbed when the part of the game comes where Anakin fights Master Windu and the subsequent distruction of the Jedi Temple. Did this bother anyone else?"
2,Real Letdown,Anyone who has played Battlefront knows why this is a letdown. Dual player coop mode has only four scenes!! Four! I really expected much more. Graphics are great but it's mindless and lacking in tactics.
4,CHEAT CODES ARE A MUST !,"this game is a good expantion of the film and uses elements from the book witch make it a ""must have"" for hard core star wars fans. however, the difficulty is hard even on easy and it does get repeditive after a while (cutting open doors & panels)the following are cheat codes for the x-boxJAINA ....... ALL JEDI AND FORCE MOVESKAIBURR ....... UNLIMITED FORCEXUCPHRA ....... UNLIMITED HEALTHKORRIBAN ...... ALL STORIE MODES UNLOCKEDHOPE THIS HELPS !"
1,the force is not strong with this one,This game is a complete pile of rubbish. You would have had a better time burning 50 dollars than playing this worthless excuse of a game. It is just horrible i beat it in 3 hours and you only need to press the Y button over and over agian and no one can touch you. The graphics suck and the duel mode is awful. I traded it in already and i got thirty dollars for it which i though was a great deal because no one at school would give me close to that much. Trade it in and buy brothers in arms it is incredible and it is only thiryt dollars.
2,A weak entry,"This game is disapointing. It is good marketing for the movie but the game play is basic and boring. It only took one day to complete. There is no camera movement to flesh out the surroundings and your movement is contained to the screen. There are only 2 Jedi powers you can use per character, the positive is that they are easy to use. There is no online option so when you are done the game...that's it. I will have a used copy on an auction site soon....."
5,The Force is with this Spectacular Action Game!,"Ok, so I'm a little late in playing this game, but I love it. I purchased this game two days ago, and yes, I beat it in two sittings. The missions are so immersive, the controls are wonderful and the gameplay is simply addicting. One of my favorite things about this game is the careful attention to the plot. I was a bit worried that the video game would be a watered down version of the PG-13 film... I was very wrong. Certain levels in this game put you right into the muderous shoes of Darth Vader, killing everything that comes between you and your goals, while others put you in the shoes of the hero Obi Wan.As far as graphics, well, these rate at about a 6.5 to 7.0 right now in 2007, but for that generation of games they rate an easy 8.0. The game is moderately long, (the story mode takes about 6 or 7 hours) but there is so much replayability that story mode doesn't even put a knick in the potential gameplay.Overall this is a must buy!"
2,What a drag,"I am a big fan of the Star Wars video games, but this one is a definate let down. The game is mindless and simple with very few even challenging parts. The game took almost no time to complete and left me feeling ripped off after only a few hours of playing. The game was more about pimping the movie by showing actual movie footage, than by giving the game substance and meat. If you want a movie preview this is your game, if you want a game keep shopping. What a drag."
5,BEST OF LIGHTSABER DUALING EVER,"despite the length of the game... this is by far the best star wars ""lightsaber dualing"" game i have ever played, and if your one of those people there isn't much to say, just go buy the dang thing... but it is a spoiler... considering it follows the story line so incredibly close to the movie... but still do yourself a favor and spend your money on a game that is worth getting, with plenty of combos, and force powers, freesyle action, and the co-op... just doesn't get any better...obviously i enjoyed this a lot!!... but stop listening to me and go buy it!!!...."
2,Revenge of the NES,"This crappy game feels like an old NES game. I hate it. I hate it because it had the potential to be a GREAT game. But you can't move the camera around, you can't even really MOVE around (invisible walls galore!), you get shot at from guys you can't even see as everyone attacks you from off-screen, and even the versus combat is exceedingly frustrating. When you go up against someone like Greivous, don't even bother getting near him if you're playing against the computer. I love Star Wars, so I bought this thing, I played it, I enjoyed parts of it but....if you've played the Jedi Outcast games don't even think of buying this totally average bore. You just can't go back o old NES style gaming...."
1,stinks!,It is hard at times.It is more of a renting game.It makes me sweat because there is so many controls. RENT IT!!!
3,"Could be better, but its alrite","Starwars III revenge of the sith is a fun game thats easy to control and play. play as obi wan kenobi or anakin skywalker. this game could be better though.2/5 graphics: faces are blocky and distorted, player move weird.4/5 game controls: easy to use and play3/5 game play: game is repetitive and levels are long and get boring.4/5 music and SFX: good music for different parts, lightsabers sound just like the original. voices are from original actors3/5 overall: if ur a starwars freak, this is for you. but if not this game aint that great."
2,"Cheap Lock, Sagging Front Doors","I bought the cabinet awhile ago now and the first thing I noticed was that the ""lock"" was plastic, the second was that it didn't even reach the slot made for it to keep the door closed. Now I've started noticing that the front doors are sagging from the weight of the DVD's inside. Not worth it, and isn't worth taking with on a move."
2,Locking Audio Video Storage Cabinet with Solid Oak Doors,"The lock on the left side of the cabinet is in a stupid place. In order to unlock or lock, you have to remove the DVD's on the top shelf to do it, if you don't lock it, then the door will swing open. I had to purchase another locking system to keep the door from swinging open. Plus there is a plank of wood you put in the cabinet right in front of your DVD's you have no idea what the movies are until you take two or three out to get at it. I am wondering is this piece necessary?"
2,This should be around $189.99 more then that you paid to much,The would is nice and it seems not to stress when full. other then that not much good to report. I should take about a half hour to build but because the directions are so bad that it will take you hours. There a step that you set the center beam and it gives you what holes to use for cds and dvd then it says adjust for vhs 9 inch boxes and other height but this is one of the first steps its like ask you to fit your set in a car when you only have the 4 wheels on.They could not spend anther few cents to put magnets on door so they do not open by themselves . You will have to go buy them yourself.this could be nice if they spent a little bit more time on this.get some bookends and magnets will help a lot. because of how its made the magnets have to line up with the outer frame of the door not near the lock end.this need work. if your paying over $230 your paying to much .
1,difficult to use and extremely poorly organized,"I've found the O'Reilly C# Language Pocket Reference extremely useful and sensibly organized. Unfortunately, this pocket reference for the other main .NET language is just the opposite. To my mind, a poorly organized pocket reference is a fatal flaw. For example, the table of contents is 2 and 3/4 pages long. Almost two of those pages describes pages 1-17 in the book (covering constants and enumerations in detail), while the other 3/4 of a contents page describes, with no detail, the remaining 125 pages. With no index as well, it is almost impossible to find what you are looking for except by looking page-by-page. Want to find, say, the syntax of a select statement? Then you have to wade through a hundred-odd pages of non-alphabetically listed function descriptions."
4,I can't agree with the critics here,"I'm a guy who has been programming professionally since 1994. Many, even most, of the contracts I have worked on have been VB contracts. I've been on board with VB since version 3. I was one of the many who were completely thrown off by the conversion to VB.NET, hence I decided to switch to C# rather than make the jump to VB.NET. After learning C# I was forced by professional circumstance to use a little VB.NET on projects where conversion to C# was not an option. This little book gave me all of the information I needed to make the jump, and make it quick. It contains a gold-mine of information at every little glance. It's not a tutorial, it is a quick reference. I think it is a terrific little book."
3,Can't Find Stuff Fast Enough,Not worth it really. It's faster to find something on google than to find something in this book. Although the book is good ...
3,Decent for a slim book,I bought this book for a VB online class I was taking. At the time I needed something to look up commands for when I was on the raod and didn't have Internet access and I didn't want to carry many heavy computer books in my bag.While working on the projects for class there were some commands that I couldn't find when searching the MSDN discs that the school sent me but luckally I was able to find them in the book which allowed me to finish the project.While the book is not cover everything and the organization could really use a lot of work since I had to search page to page to find what I was looking for it was the good enough for what I needed it for.
2,"Avery Index Maker Dividers, 5-Tab, White, 5 Sets (11408)","I placed an order for Avery Index Maker Dividers, 5-Tab, White, 5 Sets (11408). What I received is green tabs instead of the white as listed in ad. I needed to get the report out so used one set of the green though it was not my preferred tab color."
3,"It MIGHT be a great book, but I wouldn't know as it's in French. The seller didn't tell me THAT.","Title kind of says it all, but if you buy this book and you live in the US/UK/Aus/NZ/Canada (etc etc) make sure and double check that the copy you're buying is in English. Seems like the seller would have mentioned that at some point, but they didn't. So now I have a book that I was dying to read, but can't.I guess I could always learn French huh? =)"
4,"Fun, furry read","I don't think I'm ""letting the cat out of bag"" to say that this is a fun book for the cat owner. If you'd like to know the origin of that expression, it's in this book. Using the vehicle of questions that have occurred to many of us, Desmond Morris, reveals a lot about house cat behavior. The questions range from ""Why does a cat chatter when it sees a bird""; ""How does a cat use its whiskers"", and ""Why does a cat sneer"". Along the way are some fascinating facts; such as a difference in feather plucking behavior in New and Old World cats, and the ear markings (for example of tigers) as a means of enhancing signaling form the ears. Morris may be forgiven for a few presumptions about cat motives (particularly with respect to humans)."
5,Essential reading for cat lovers!,"Catwatching on the Kindle...I read this with two of my eighteen cats (we live in the country...)on my lap. This book is most entertaining, full of 'trueisms' and most enlightening. I have owned and loved cats for more than 60 years, but still found a lot to learn in this delightful, readable book. Buy it!"
5,Buy this Wonderful Cat's Companion Book,"We never really own cats. We live with them. Cats allow us a little room in the sock drawer (prime napping quarters) and an extra five minutes under the covers on Saturday (Where's breakfast?) However, when it comes to understanding a cat's quirks, no book is better than this one to offer reliable explanations by someone who truly respects the Feline community. I've been in residence with cats for most of my life and this little book has enhanced my experience with the ""critters"" immensely. It's a must read for any novice cat companion."
4,Answers!,"Never bee nable to understand your kitty - now you can! A great read from the Naked Ape author, Desmond Morris."
5,Description,"Schlessinger Video Productions1994Running Time: 30 min.VHS FormatDescription: Abusive relationships are an ever-growing problem in adolescent love relationships. Jealousy, possissiveness, controlling behaviors, abusive language, degrading words, and outright violence are the indicators. Strangely, the victim often feels that what is happening must be ""normal"" - or if not, that he or she is somehow at fault. A victim begins to become isolated, afraid, and less and less likely to understand the extent of the abuse as it happens.This tape presents interviews with abused individuals, abuse counselors, and an abuser. Each discusses his or her own experiences, the brutal cycle of emotional and physical abuse, and warning signs of an abusive relationship, and how to get help and legal assistance if you are in one"
5,holy mother of my dog,"ladeeeez n b-boys, can the jamz be ANY hotter n DIS??? Fully delivering on the new school Delta Blues tip, Mississipi has not sounded so booty-bumpin' transcendent since our boy John Fahey fell in battle (god bless his block-rockin' soul). 5 true-gangstaz gets down to biznis before your finger leaves the play button, and drops the Phatest solo guitar action on your head: Indian devotional, Gypsy dances, Minimalist Country, and Middle Eastern Blues all mixed with a familiar American Folk tradition and put together with jaw dropping, effortless virtuosity. Ain't nothin but a G thang, y'all."
5,Not to be Ignored,"In short, this is some of the best Sibelius on disc. The first symphony crackles.It is brisk. It has fire and passion, but, to my ears, sounds appropriately less romantic than most interpretations. The symphony comes across as more than just a lightweight first published symphony.The seventh is also swift, but deep, and logically developed. It all makes sense. If you want a more romantic approach look elsewhere.The playing is superb, the conducting brilliant, the recording less brilliant, a bit ""hissy"", but the playing says it all."
2,"Great looks, great feel, if only it wasn't so loud...","I bought this mouse as part of a desktop package (mx 3200). The keyboard is fine but the scroll wheel on the mouse is to loud, especially on the upward scrolling motion, and therefore distracting. In comparison, my $10 wired laser mouse is 'squeek' free."
5,Best hand to mouse fit I have ever seen.,"this is the BEST mouse I have ever used, I bought this mouse because I was sick of always having to move the pointer all the way across the screen to click the back buttong with my old mouse (too lazy to hit ALT+left arrow), now I have a back button right there on the mouse, I also plan on assigning the other keys to be used in video games.side note, I can place this mouse on my head and it works through my hair, that's pretty nice I guess."
4,Raymarine St40 Bidata,"Nice, simple and relatively inexpensive Depth Sounder and Speed. Easy to use, nice big numbers very readable even in full sun or at night with back lit display. Includes all logs and alarm to expectDisplay developed some abnormalities during the first season. Raymarine support was useful and courteous, but I had to send the unit back to them during the winter for repair. Not fun!!!But they did repair and it has been working flawlessly for now 5 years, so I am not complaining"
3,Inexpensive but design needs improvement,"The first thing I noticed is that the chain popped off often. Since the plastic oil applicator for the chain has a large surface that extends near the chain, the applicator was quickly ruptured by the chain. I spent the rest of the time oiling the chain by hand. Replacing the chain about a dozen times, I was able to cut down, limb, and chop up three relatively large pine trees (50' high) and a large overhanging branch of a box elder. After that the chain popped off as soon as the chain touched wood. I took it apart and found the plastic bearing inside the main gear was wiped.While the packaging and instructions lead one to believe that this chainsaw is a good general purpose chainsaw, I believe this chainsaw would be more suited for light duty jobs. It is inexpensive and would be more than adequate for limbing trees around an average yard. Hopefully the design problems will be fixed in the future."
5,Only light-duty use.,"I've used this for a few years now. It cuts light stuff great and the power of the motor suggests it would do bigger trees (up to 14"") also but not so. The motor doesn't hold up when under load. Keep to small 6 inch branches or smaller and it will do fine. Mine went up in smoke a few days ago when cutting a large chunk of cherry into bowl blanks."
2,Not a heavy duty model,"Mine just burned up after a year of medium-duty use (branches and trees up to 12""). The chain did not keep its tension well, and did pop off numerous times. Also, the chain oil tended to drip constantly, causing stains on my basement floor in several places (yeah, I should have known better, but...). Anyway, I'm moving on to a ""real"" chainsaw, and I wouldn't really recommend this model unless you keep its use to a minimum and your cutting sessions not too long. And keep the chain sharp!!!"
1,A poorly made toy,"I didn't have huge expectations of this chain saw, and I only bought it for occasional use on my 1/2 acre wooded property. This saw failed to meet my already low expectations.The Remington is severely anemic and can barely cut a substantial limb. To top it off, it's cheaply made. Mine broke after about 6 uses, and can't be fixed (a plastic part cracked during routine use). As noted by others, the chain falls off repeatedly and it needs constant adjustments. And it drips oil constantly, so put newpaper under it.There's a reason this chain saw is so inexpensive. It's not worth it, and not worth the convenience of an electric tool. For a few bucks more, you can get a gas saw that gets the job done and will last more than 1/2 season."
1,Why are people voting 5 stars?,"Like everybody else's: short-lived, leaks oil, and chain slips off frequently. Mine died in less than a month.Why are people panning this and giving it 5 stars?Reviewers: 1 star is the last item in the pulldown, not the first."
1,Very light duty.,Only for very light/occasional duty. Very poorly constructed. Leaks oil & chain slips off frequently. A real dissapointment.
1,Get a GAS CHAINSAW!!,"Chain slips constantly even after a few minutes of use. Constant chain adjustment makes it's use, time consuming and aggravating.Save your money and put it towards a small gas chainsaw or look at some better built electrics. I am sure that other compnaies make a much better electric saw.Good Luck!"
4,"Divider tabs should be used only with punched paper, not clear holders.","I got these to put music in alphabetical order. Unfortunately, my music goes in clear holders. the extra length the clear holders adds to the width of the page winds up hiding the tabs of the alphabetical dividers. Only use these if you punch holes in your original papers, which won't enable them to hold up to repeated flipping back and forth."
4,"Good, but too long....","I enjoyed this book, but at times the author went on and on too much about things. I would have liked it better, if she just cut to the chase and didn't drag it out so much.The ending was ok, but a bit melodramatic. Reading the diary part really hooked me, and I think wanting to know what happened to the heroine is what kept me reading through the slow parts."
3,It was different,"I don't know what genre to put this in.I did enjoy reading it.There is some sexual content.So if that bothers you, don't read it.Otherwise I would recommend it for a weekend read."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!,"This book drags along,as told by Tomasino, who is not nearly as clever as he would have you believe. He'll lead up to big act of revenge, and What?! that's what they've been plotting over for days? There are too many good books out there to waste your time on this one!"
5,Wonderfully kinky,"I LOVED this book. I sat down with it on a Friday night and read straight through to Sunday. Great fantasy, great kinky sex. Just a damn good read"
1,Weak potion,"I really did not enjoy this novel at all--surprising, since I absolutely loved Moline's first novel, ""Lunch."" I thought the story was too slow and the plot far too convoluted. Beyond that, I felt the sadomasochism went far too far. I hope Moline goes back to the type of story she did in ""Lunch"" for her next effort."
3,Controversy about photos,"I found the book to be informative, especially since there is a photo of my families great grand father, Miles Crazy Walking on page 95. There is contoversy here at our Tribal Office because the name under Crazy Walking is Cottonwood. I would like to communicate with the author about his resources."
4,Very good product,"Perfect for what I was looking for - extra wide so works very well with sheet protectors, big tab so can fit two lines of text on them, and clear tabs so I don't have a distracting rainbow of colors. The included sheet of printable inserts worked very well, Word 2007 template was just right out the gate. Be sure to print a test page and watch specifically for text that's too close to the top edge.They include enough so you can correct and re-print, like 40 of them (2 columns x 20 rows) for only 8 tabs but it's all on one page so you can pass the sheet thru for re-prints provided you haven't removed any yet. Wish they had included more than 1 page so could later re-use the tabs but print new inserts. Stopping short of 5 stars for that as well as the fact that they could have done a better job on the vertical perforation between the columns. Had to use scizzors to ensure didn't tear, certainly not a show stopper but worth minusing a star.Buy them, you won't be disappointed."
1,A disgrace to the no-wave movement,"All the bands on this compliation should be embarrassed to be on here. Seriously, if this is supposed to be today's answer to the seminal ""No New York"" compliation, the NYC music scene is in trouble.Of course some of the tracks are OK, but the overall product is extremely weak. Track down the original ""No New York"" compilation if you want something real, basically these artists owe their careers to that album. Or buy the Ted Leo album, its also damn fine, and his is one of the only valid tracks on this disc."
4,This was better,I like this one because it has a great deal of affection and just more affection. I do think this one is one of her more better novel. This had a hero that i rather liked and the girl was alright....in this book it was fun seeing how the main characters played off each other. So I do recommend this one.
2,Delightfully Surprisingly Enjoyable,"I discovered this book quite accidentally. I had never heard of Amanda Quick (or Jayne Ann Krentz). I thought it would be boring, but it was engrossingly interesting. I thought the hero was a very sexy guy and the heroine was ok,if not quite believable. The plot was obvious almost from the beginning, but I still had no trouble reading it. I plan to read all the books I can by Amanda and Jayne Ann."
5,"UNBELIEVABLE, REMARKABLE, CHATTY AND WITTY","It's been a long time since I read a novel this size in 8 hours. I couldn't work, read it through Dr.s examination, while feeding my Siamese Topaz, everywhere for 8 hours, I carried this book. Please find a way to get this book in docu-drama form on PBS. It's another in the quality line of Bramwell!! Please find a way to put this novel to the small screen."
3,"Formula, but not all bad","I liked the alchemist angle and the fact that the guy isn't an Earl or Duke. That set it apart from her other novels. However, the physical stuff is ALWAYS the SAME. First, they have an encounter where he satisfies her. Later, they actually do the deed, and frequently this is how he discovers she's a virgin. Quick doesn't make the horrendous grammatical errors that are present in some other works, and her research appears to be adequate. However, the books are so similar I don't think I can afford the time to read another of them."
3,Affair was a so-so book with a so-so script nothing exciting,"Affair, by Amanda Quick. Usually I like A. Quick's books. Affair was too bland. I think A. Quick took the personality of her hero to much to heart and it colored the entire script. The hero did not want to be involved, wanted to be left alone in his lab and that was how I felt -- uninvolved and too far removed from the characters of the book."
3,It is bettter than Mischief but not better than Deception,"Affair is more interesting book to read than her last book, Mischief. The plot of the villian is too predicatable though. I would thought Amanda can do a little better than that. The plot is almost a mix of Deception and Mistress( Amanda's earlier books), nothing new"
2,"same old, same old","One of the most telling things about the quality of the plot and characterization in Affair was that I could not even remember the storyline the day after I finished it! It was so vanilla pudding and such a regurgitation of Quick's former plotlines that I was bitterly disappointed. I'm beginning to think Quick has lost her touch in coming up with original new storylines -- her last 3 books seem like repeat television shows. I'm a little tired of women who are only spunky and honest and men who are strong, silent and misunderstood. The same applies to her books written under the pseudonym Jayne Ann Krentz -- only a few are worthwhile. None of this stops me from reading Seduction, Scandal, Surrender and Reckless over and over. Stick to earlier Quick books -- they have better plotlines and more interesting characters."
4,"A fun romantic mystery, unusual for the gendre","First off, the plot is not particularly realistic. However, once you're past that, it's great fun. The heroine is self-assured and forceful, the hero has his strengths but can be quirky and clearly needs what the heroine offers, the plot moves well. Not perfect, but a good Amanda Quick example."
4,Nice book to read,It's a nice book to read BUT its just predictible - otherwise I would have given it a 5 stars
3,Not her best,"I used to really like Amanda Quick. But lately her stories have gotten predictable, her characters very similar and rather boring. This is an ok book, but I misss the Amanda Quick who wrote Desire. That had characters you could really enjoy and connect with. This book I probably won't do more than glance through again."
2,Have read better books by Amanda,"This book was alright. Like I said, I have read better books. The first Historical Romance novel I ever read was written by Amanda Quick, (Desire) so that is why I have read all of her books. I usually have a pretty good memory, but I can't even remember the hero's or heroin's name anymore (I read this book about a year and half ago). I'd recomend you read ""Mystic"", ""Mischief"", or ""Dangerous""."
3,"Too similar to author's other books, lacks tension and spark","As with all of Quick's books, this plot is similar to others, but that's not the only thing that holds this one back. Although the hero is interesting, the relationship between him and the heroine lacks spark. The tension is missing, so the plot falls flat. The characterization isn't as well-developed and the dialogue is repetitive. Definitely not one of the author's best."
3,an interesting intrtoductory text,"This book was an interesting read with a decidedly feminist twist. This book would be excellent for a beginner, because it helps the beginning reader to develop a sense of the cards and their meanings, relating to real life. You can then do general, intuitive readings without having to constantly refer to another text. However, it doesn't have specific interpretations, so it's not the kind of book one would refer to again and again. A weakness that I saw was the lack of interpretations for minor arcana cards, and lack of advanced interpretation. It's a good book, however, for the woman who wants to use the tarot as a psychological tool and who wants to do very general readings for herself. If, however, you're looking for an in-depth or mystical/spritual treatment of the cards, another book may be more useful to you."
1,yet another batch of anti-southern stereotypes rehashed,"I bought this book on the reccomendation of a fellow civil war buff. I was hoping for some fresh insights on the subject of the lost cause and it's continued effect on our (southern) lives. Instead it is a collection of overblown, trite, highly condescending, negative, hateful fiction. I have lived in the south/southwest my entire life (44 yrs) and I have never encountered anyone remotely resembling the ignorant, racist, borderline psychopaths that the author claims to have found on almost every street corner south of Mason-Dixon. This book is not what I expected. I will avoid further works of fiction by Mr. Horwitz."
1,Making a living by South-bashing,"Unfortunately just another attempt by a Yankee-peddler to make a quick buck off the South and the national interest in the war. There is not an intellectually valid chapter in the book. Half way through, I knew I had been flim-flammed and wanted my money back. Don't make my mistake."
1,"Quite simply, this is an awful book","Horwitz has missed a grand opportunity; instead of offering sound research on a fascinating subject, he provides readers with a large serving of overdone tripe and a side order of preconceived notions.Quite simply, this in awful book filled with the rantings of a biased, prejudiced journalist. He has an agenda: to hold our fellow Americans (southern folk) up to ridicule and scorn--and he is a master at doing this.Don't waste your time or money on this one . . . there are too many other good books out there."
4,"Finally, someone explores the Civil War buff phenomenon!","This book is fascinating. Horwitz creates a perfect mix of interesting characters, historical facts and little-explored locations. Probably be hard to convince a non-civil war buff to read it, but it really is 50% travel book. (ie ""Blue Highways"" or ""Travels with Charley)."
5,Controversial subject ably handled,"There's no way Tony Horwitz or any author could wrestle with a topic as inherently controversial as the Civil War's legacy without provoking such polarized opinions as you see among these readers/reviewers. It goes with the turf. Contrary to some other reviewers' opinions, I found the book gracious, compassionate, and completely enthralling. I especially appreciate the last few chapters where Horwitz discusses one of the most troubling aspects of US society today - our ongoing racial tensions - intelligently and objectively."
4,Actually pretty fair,"It and age of knee- jerk South bashing and marxist-revisionist blather about a virtuous and nonsensical (not to mention historically WRONG) crusade to end slavery this is pretty refreshing. I'm not sure how the author escaped his education with an open mind on the subject but he should be applauded for doing so. He went looking, asked open ended questions with an eye to the fact that maybe, perhaps it just might be possible to actually learn something and come to a broader more mature understanding. I believe he largely succeeded. Deep down I do think most folks realize they have been snowed on the ""Civil War"" but in these politically correct times are afraid to even ask the types of questions that might open their eyes. Buy it and read it with an open mind. What's the worst tht can happen? You might actually learn something."
5,More sociology than history...,"but entertaining and somewhat revelatory regardless of whether you're more interested in history or psychology. Somewhat sympathetic towards the bizarre Southern subculture which refuses to believe that (a) they lost, and (b) we're much better off that they did."
4,Horwitz identifies two enduring American legacies,"Tony Horwitz has launched into an exploration of the Civil War--and has come across two enduring legacies of our country: slavery (now known as ""racism"") and states' rights. Both were involved in the Civil War--and both continue.The book is both humorous and frightening. It is also highly informative and educational."
4,Going to places most Civil War buffs don't even think about.,"Ranging from the quirky to the serious, Horwitz captures the various levels of influence that the Civil War has had on the modern American South. From race-related violence in Kentucky to the obsessive quest for accuracy of a small group of civil war reenactors Horwitz takes the reader on a fascinating journey into the American South."
2,Starts good then drags on.,In the beginning this looks like an excellent book but I couldn't read any furture after completeing 2/3 of the book. I would say this is a collection of ramblings rather than a book. He never seems to get to a point and bounces between race relations in America and some civil war history with alot of the modern day re-enactment movement mixed in. Frankly I didn't learn alot from this book. I will give his technical ability a thumbs up but the story just wanders on and on ending knowhere.
5,"Interesting and Disturbing, but a GREAT READ!","This is an extremely entertaining book and very well written. The characters are real although sometimes you almost wonder and hope that they aren't. The Civil Wargasm with Robert Lee Hodge is, well, interesting. Each chapter tells the story of a different stop on Horwitz's journey across the south and there are colorful characters at each. It was very hard to put the book down at times and hard to keep reading it at others. I almost put it down for good with the chapter ""Dying For Dixie"" Sad! I'm glad that I kept with however. It was quite a ride, but well worth it!! Really a good read!!!!!"
2,He didn't get it,"I don't think that Mr. Horwitz was able to truly understand the people he was interacting with. My sense of the book is that he came close to the true feelings of many Southerners, but didn't dig deep enough, which made the book at times offensive. Still, he made the effort, which is more than most people do."
1,Confederates in the Attic,Recently purchased Confederates in the Attic to read on my Kindle. I am a born and bred southerner. Purchased the book to get a different perspective regarding our attitudes toward northerners and to understand why southerners have a history of harboring bad feelings about losing the Civil War. Tony Horwitz comes across as someone that had a pre-opinion of the south that was debasing. His negative bias about the South is obvious. His descriptions of southerners and the south are grossly inaccurate. In my opinion he goes out of his way to paint a negative picture that is not close to how people and places are really like. Could not finished the book--I have been to several places he wrote about in the book and his descriptions were so far off I have to stop readng. Did not trust his book could provide any insights that are worth knowing about. Don't waste your time. Phil/Raleigh/NC
2,Just average.,"What a disappointment. This book was a somewhat interesting read, as I'm both intrigued by the South and a Civil War buff. However, Horwitz's ""I'm above it all"" tone is unpleasant; his seeming expectation that every Civil War battlefield should remain a pristine, undeveloped sanctuary is unrealistic; his endless criticism of the minute is at first boring, then annoying. (As a native Southern Californian, you'll forgive me for not being shocked that there are mini-malls in the South.) I am sorry that I wasted my money buying a copy of this book, as I will not be picking it up again in the future."
3,take this book with a grain of salt,"A very entertaining book but a horrible depiction of the south. This definitely was a page turner but i was confused at the authors intent and i was really taken back by many of the reviews for this book. Many reviewers below have bashed the southern people making them all sound like ""backwoods racists"". Mr. Horowitz interviewed and wrote about a handful of southern extremists and ,according to many of the previous reviews, this is how the majority of southerners act. I have lived my whole live in the south except for the last two years where i have lived in Japan. I have traveled around the united states and around the world and there is one thing i have noticed that there is ""extremist"" or ""racists"" everywhere but i do not compare that country or state to those small minded people. This book should be taken with a grain of salt."
3,The South is like a vortex...,"Mr. Horwitz a pulitzer prize winner author decides to dive in to the South's fascination of why we think we're better than the rest of the country/world. It begins slow, but picks up speed and if you've lived or was raised in the South then I bet you've met at least someone similar to those that Horwitz came across in his journey. His objective writing is to be commended, he could have easily made fun of most of the people and felt sorry for them, but he states ""How can you condemn and ridicule someone so passionate about a lifestyle that God himself might have chosen as to where his residence would be"". Its a good read, little drawn out but I'd recommend it only if you've lived in the South. Otherwise you might just ""not get it"""
4,Humor and insight into the American South,"When I first picked up the book I thought it was going to be another New Yorker writing about how backward and dumb Southerners are. (I was born in NY and now live in Virginia). I was happily surprised to see that it was not. The author describes the modern south through the lens of the civil war. The characters and stories are better than any fiction. His statements on the importance of the civil may be a bit overblown, since he mainly spoke with people with a heavy interest in the war. Like most American students I fear that southern children know very little about the war. The book reads well and it very enjoyable. I would call it travel writing with an historical twist. For military history buffs it is a nice break from the usual style."
1,BAIT AND SWITCH,"I have to agree with the other one star commentors. This book is nothing more than a collection of anecdotes about eccentrics and trivia, sprinkled with disapproving comments about the South by the author. It leads nowhere and you learn nothing. The author's lack of knowledge about the war shows also. This book had an interesting premise, but the author failed to follow through. At least now I know I can make a quick buck writing about all the eccentric kooks I met while living up North. Don't waste your money or your time y'all."
2,More revisionist history from a yankee view,"Tony tries to keep us involved in the War Between the States arena by walking us through several battlefields and something that is referred to as a ""Civil Wargasm"", or attempting to recreate the paths of confederate soldiers through Virginia and bits of Maryland and Pennsylvania. What he accomplishes is more northern bigotry against any and all Southern culture and people, especially those who revere their past. As long as one doesn't try to draw any historical or sociological conclusions, ""Confederates in the Attic"" is a 'cute' little book. I would, however, not recommend it for the Civil War Buffs' library."
1,Totally Overated Book,"Over the past few years at least a dozen people have asked me if I had ever read ""Confederates in the Attic?"" Being interested in Civil War history, I decided to finally check a copy out of the library. I cannot understand why this book has the reputation it has or how it won a pulitzer prize. I found the book to be completly boring, of little historical value, and not at all amusing. In my opinion it is completely overated and I would not recommend anyone wasting their time trying to read it. There are many other history books about the Civil War that are far more interesting to read, and for more worth one's time."
1,"Shallow, unbelievable, smug","The American Civil War was staged for fathers to connect with their sons, and to have people to look down upon and make up stories about? That, and of course...racism. Horowitz embellishes his encounters and reports with a >wink, wink< of perfect complicity the overdone characterizations and and self-serving displays (yes, I know the Southern Guard and Rob H.) At least at the very end, he exposes plainly his biases, and nearly admits that his prejudices overweigh any honest evaluation and understanding of the American South (past or present), but this doesn't wash away the one-eyed-view of the previous chapters. Although I have never lived south of the Mason-Dixon line, I can't help but take the poor reporting personally; to anyone who wishes to truly understand things, Horowitz is offensive. I wish I'd not wasted the money."
5,Excellent and thought provoking,"Horowitz has created a memorable work. This is a thought provoking, poignant and humorous account. This book really makes you think. An extraordinary weaving of the past and the present. Superb!!!"
5,Great Journey!,For those that like or dislike the Civil War this book is well worth your time. A very interesting way to see the long term effects of the Civil War. Facts and figures are great and Michael Beck does a great job on the voices...
4,Not Civil War. In 1990's an extended trip to visit sites of Civil war with recreators,Good read. Growing up fastenated with the Civil War a step back in time to get truest expenience one can get for the time of being the time. the quest to find the places that exisited at time and how war exisits hearts even today
4,Confederates in the Attic,"This was a really good book that was recxommended to me by a friend of mine who is an avid reader. usually, I don't read nonfiction, but a really enjoyed this book. It's very hard to believe that some of the attitudes and opinions expressed by people that the author interviewed while researching his book are still adhered to in 2012!!The book was well written and i recommend it not only to Civil War buffs but everyone. I think this would be a very impactful book for a high school curriculum."
4,"To Think, These Are Still Questions We Must Ask Ourselves","Is it possible to celebrate your ancestry without being offensive if your ancestors were Confederates and/or opposed the Civil Rights Movement? What does the Confederate flag represent to you -- Southern Pride or racism? Tony Horwitz ponders such questions as he visits the battlefields of the Civil War and discovers how the ""War Between the States"" truly hasn't ended for some folks."
3,"An Interesting Story, but a Slow Read","This novel is written by Tony Horwitz basically as an account of his travels through the South. On his travles he passes through many historic towns and stops at important landmarks. As interesting as this may sound, this novel is written almost like a 400 page newspaper article. It was a task to bring myself to finishing this novel, but since it was a required assignment I had to. Otherwise I would have put it down after the first chapter and stuck on a shelf somewhere.For those diehard southerners or anyone who enjoys learning about the Civil War this would probably be an interesting and descent novel. However, for those who look for suspense and action when reading a book I reccomend that you stay away from this particular novel. I have given it a three out of five stars only because some parts did interest me, but for the most part I did not look forward to having to continue reading this book."
4,Confederates in the Attic,"Because the US Civil War was fought mainly in the southern states, and the Confederacy was defeated by the North, the Southern remembrance of the war is not like the Northern. Tony Horwitz reports on the South's memory of the war and Southern attitudes about the war and its aftermath. Civil War reenactors are portrayed in the book, but they are only part of it. I have no experience with Civil War reenacting but do have experience with Old West reenacting and so I understand and identify with the ""hardcore"" desire to create and live the past in the present.It should be mentioned that this book was published in 1998, during the Clinton presidency, which saw the rise across the country of grievances against the Federal Government. So some of what Horwitz reports as Rebel attitude in the South wasn't in fact restricted to those states."
4,Better than Expected,"Considering the topic was primarily about people who were still obsessed with the Civil War (which on the surface seems a bit ridiculous to me), not a bad tale. Well told by the author who did quite a bit of research and traveling to examine the impact the Civil War had and still has, especially (or primarily) in the South. The perspective of rednecks, Civil War reenactors, African Americans, Southern Aristocrats, liberals, are all brought out objectively by the author."
5,People from 130 years ago must think we're all loony,"Horwitz's writing style is beautiful. He has an unabashedly Jewish, white, urban, young and educated perspective from which he interprets the people and events that he comes across. The result is obviously skewed, but in a way that is lighthearted and surprisingly open. He meets an extraordinary range of people in this trip, and portrays them all with an earnestness and sense of humor that admits his own humanity as well as all of ours."
3,Entertaining but Unbalanced,"I enjoyed this book, I think his style of writing is really funny and entertaining. However, it would have been nice if he had interviewed some people that are not either dirt poor and uneducated or on the opposite end of the spectrum and extremely educated, scholarly individuals....you know....for perspectives sake. Most people in the south are probably in the middle class by now and living in the burbs outside of major cities. I don't think he interviewed anyone in this demographic. Maybe it wouldn't have made for an entertaining read if he interviewed people that were just like, ""meh"", about the civil war. Overall I don't regret reading it though."
5,Rythm and Flow,"Shiva's Drum is a collection of poems by Stephen Cramer that flow into each other as much as they stand out in their own unique rhythm and meaning. The pieces mostly deal with humanity, music, and culture. Cramer integrates lyrics, a epigraph from the bible, and current affairs (both public and personal.) These fingerprints of Cramer's writing style seem to engage the reader, and make them feel inside the stories. He deals with darker themes as well. In the second section of the book, ""Three Little Birds, 130th Street"" juxtaposes the lyrics of Bob Marley's song playing in the background, to a woman being attacked by someone she knew and saved by the narrator. The next poem, ""Two Tattoos,"" deals with addiction and abuse, and the symbol of scars being not what they where from, but meaning what the bearer assigns them. Regardless of subject, each poem is clearly presented as Cramer felt them; each sense is attended too and satisfied, with the pace of the city and the poets' life."
1,Distort vision!,"Bought them for eye protection at the gun range, so I can use my prescription glasses when I want to. However, they distort the image and with that you can imagine how good you can actually shoot!"
5,A very impressive and usable work.,"This is an applied math book which is highly usable, and also very good for building intuitive understanding. I have recommended this book highly for many years, and I am delighted to see it back in print."
5,Deeply insightful and utterly fascinating,"I had the privilege to explore this guide to the universe of asymptotics under Prof. Bender. I used to think, and still do (about 2 decades on), that this book is like the Rosetta Stone, and enables us to solve anything in applied mathematics.A must have for anyone looking to understand the incredible universe we find ourselves in!"
4,useful book,"The book is good and the methods seem effective. It assumes a very serious mathematical background, however, and the problems are quite challenging."
2,It sucks. But what choice do you have.........,"I had to buy this olive color to change marshalls horrible ""neutral"" spot tone to an actual neutral color (it is blue).I would say don't buy the stuff but there is not much in the way of options."
1,"Should have ""multipassed this one up""!","We purchased this product because of Canon's reputation. We have used other Canon products and were totally pleased, however, we were disappointed in the need for frequent ink tank changes. Also, we believed we were getting a color scanner as well as black and white. We should have done our homework more thoroughly. Very disappointed!"
1,Junk,"This is a junk machine. Slow, eat a lot of inks. And recently, although I changed new cartages, it prints nothing on paper."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"This is the worst thing you could ever spend your money on, and it does not come cheap. When it does work, and there is a 90% chance that it does not, the quality of printing is unbelievably poor. It eats the most ink I have ever seen a machine use up. Canon customer service has been most unhelpful although the machine is still under warranty. Do yourself a favor, spend your money elsewhere."
1,Destroy this Canon,"Have been trying to use this machine for 4 months now. It has been connected and installed on three different pc(s) and does not perform at all. The manual does not help, nor does the 800 number. We shall by an Epson this weekend and put this one out for the trash men, after of course taking a hammer to it. (NOTE; the 800 number and the store where purchased only wants to blame the problem on you, your pc or your cable). Do not spend your monies here!"
1,go in for Laser printers!,Unsatisfied with the product. Too many problems as compared to others I have worked with.-- Unhappy owner
2,Don't buy Canon!,"I purchased my multipass and it was supposed to have a color scanner (the book even said so), but when I called them about it they told me that it was a generic book and that mine was not supposed to have a color scanner. The book doesn't list any other machine except for my Canon Multipass C3500. Then my warning light wouldn't always come one when it was supposed to to tell me that I needed to replace the ink cartridge. And to top it off, my print head needs to be replaced. The reason I say don't buy Canon is because I have seen many of their printers up for sale (not just this particular kind) and every time I ask what is wrong the tell me they need a new print head. I've run into many people on the web with the same problem. If only I knew then what I know now."
3,multipass 3500,"Its always good to see that a model is still available 3 years later. We have been using this in a light-med duty office for that long. It has really good features for a home office, color copies that look great. Relatively little problems for the three years until now, that it says its out of ink but its a new cartridge. Head cleaning hasn't done the trick. It does eat ink cartridges so be aware!"
2,Could be much better,The orchestra conductor has taken too much liberty with the score. It has run amok. Certain passages are played way too fast.
5,Best Text for Christian Moral Theology,"This is an excellent textbook for the student of theology. It presumes some previous introduction to Church history, philosophy, and theology. The novice will find it challenging but yet accessible."
3,Psychological study,"Interesting not for its ""facts"" - it's a revisionist propaganda piece, reworked in different forms throughout Hoxha's rule - but valuable to scholars and interested persons for that very reason. For those with proper background, the work is interesting for what it does not say, such as Stalin's willingness to let Tito of Yugoslavia ""swallow"" Albania in return for Tito's loyalty to Moscow. Tito's refusal to accept this bribe helped bring on Moscow's wrath as well as saved Albania and Hoxha. This book is also useful in revealing the mindset of old Communists in Russia and elsewhere who still idealize the Stalin myth."
5,Great work by a great man,"...The work showes clearly the work of an outstanding writer, thinker and fighter for the victory of socialism. In his work comerade Hoxha explains how all his moves in international relations were to ensure the independence of Albania as well as to ensure the final triumph of socialism in his country for the benefit of his countrymen."
5,OPI,Pompeii Purple is my all time favorite! It's also one of the most asked for colors at the local nail salon. My purpose for purchasing this was to have it handy in case I needed a quick touchup. OPI polish is very durable and doesn't chip so I haven't yet opened it!
3,Lve the Color - Hate the Quality!,"The color of ""We'll Always Have Paris"" is pure heaven; I have received so may compliments and envious looks, I lost count. The phrase also reminds me of one of the most classiest and one of my favorite movies Casablanca, where the phrase has originated. The quality is a completely different matter. I hate it. The polish chips after a day or two. I end up doing touch ups and then have to reapply all together. It is a shame because the far lower priced products of a well know competitor have no chipping issue and wear like an Energizer bunny. I wish the manufacturer paid more attention to the quality of the product they sell and at no bargain basement prices, either."
4,Dependable,OPI is always a dependable nail polish at a fair price. This black goes on smooth and is opaque and shiny.
4,A little greener than I wanted it,"Don't get me wrong, I really like this nail color and I absolutely LOVE OPI, but when I painted my nails after I received my order the color came out a little greener than I wanted it."
5,Creamy and rich rosy color - girl you need this :),"( my skin tone is between medium and light )- Creamy and rich rosy color. I'm kinda surprised that there is only one review about it here.I had never worn such a healthy and attractive color ( from the reds and pinks )- Great formula, you need 2 coats to get the most beautiful polished candy nails :) ( you actually can get a great color with only ONE fully coat, but I prefer putting 2 )- You might find a similar color to this ( my first impression ) but you won't find the exact brightening color.- Even the name is lovely ;)Hope my review helps you to decide"
1,Opi misrepresented!,"I purchased this ""collection"" but only received one nail polish. One would believe that the collection included four shades of pink, however I only received one! This was totally misrepresented in the picture and in the product review."
1,Empty box,"Box was damaged and when I opened it, there was no product in the box only paper filler. I would like a refund or another shipment ASAP."
2,This just looks black...,When I actually put it on my nails it just looks black. I would not recommend this product to anyone else. If I wanted a black nail polish I would've bought black nail polish.
5,for feet,"I love it on my feet, it's really a mediterranean, am French and this color is amazing ! It's an olive color near of black color. I love it !"
5,Freakin Awesomee,"i loved it sooo much, it is kinda like a dark navy, with a subtle, and i mean really subtle, sparkly undertone to it. It went on really smooth, even my nails felt smooth after i put it on. It didnt have a uber strong smell. && since its navy it goes with like EVERYTHING!!"
4,Nice color!,I really like it but from the pictures I saw on the internet I thought it was going to be more glittery.... still great but it looks the best under sun light. That's when the shine comes through beautifully!!!!!!
3,NOT THE GREEN I WAS LOOKING FOR,"I was expecting a nail polish that was olive green. This green is very dark, almost black. I do like it. The polish seemed old because it appeared ""lumpy"" and had some bubbles. It could have been the base coat I was using. I will bring it with me the next time I have my nails done and see if they have the same results."
3,Not what I was expecting,"This is a little more toward orange than bronze. And it has those tiny 'sparkles' in it (I'm not crazy about 'glitter' in polish, even the very tiny ones). It's pretty enough - just not exactly what I was looking for. It's very hard to decide the true color of the polish based on a picture."
1,Inaccurate color,"Just received OPI's Manicurist of Seville polish; it is a black plum color, as opposed to the pink shade shown when ordering. Very disappointed; I don't wear blood red colors! It's a pretty shade, but NOT what was represented on the page when ordering."
3,More Pink than Java,With a name like Java Mauve I was expecting a little more Java than Mauve. This polish is more in the pink family than the browns.
5,Favorite NailPolish & Color!!!!!,The name OPI speaks for itself and for anyone who doesnt know this brand and is looking for a good quality nail polish this is a great top of the line brand with pretty good prices for the quality you are getting.This color is my all time favorite color for summer! It looks amazing aganist tanned skin! I am not a trend follower when it comes to nail polish but i love this color because its not like 80s neon but its very vibrant yet still classy. Its like a mix between neon pink and baby pink.I had a very hard time finding this color in stores so I keep it on my wishlist because I only use this color during the summers months
5,OPI Barefoot in Barcelona Nail Polish,I was very pleased with the color of this nail polish. I use it on top of their nail strengthening product. Lasts quite a while. There is nothing I have used so far that compares with OPI.
3,oops,I haven't yet used the product so not sure about quality but since it's OPI I'm sure it will be fine.But when it arrived the lid was loose and some of the polish had leaked out.be more careful when packaging
4,well pleased,just as the one used in salon came ontime and as promised color is as described and would buy a like product again
4,Cool baby pink,"Reading other reviews I feel like my bottle must have the wrong sticker on it. I love the color, it is a very pretty litte pink, delicate with a hint of coolness. One coat can be used with a french manicure (you better be good, this stuff is streaky!), but it looks very light and unnatural on my olive skin. I much prefer to do 2-3 coats and let it mattify. It has no glitter and is extremely glossy, streakless with the second coat. Love it paired with Essie's Love & Acceptance for an ultra-girly pastel feel."
1,Not what I expected it to be...,This polisha is nothing like wwhat expected it to be. I ended up giving it to my niece. It looks beautiful on a child's hands!
1,really bad,Got 2 OPI nail polishes. It stays one single day. American quality sux sux sux sux sux. Dont waste your money. European rules.
5,perfect color!,"This is a really gorgeous neutral color that lends hands a very elegant look. I feel like sometimes it's almost got a touch of purple beneath it, other times pink. Maybe it adapts. I've gifted it a couple times to some very happy recipients. This is definitely one of my staple nail-colors!"
5,OPI Party in My Cabana!!,"Extremely happy! Could't find this color of polish for sale in any area stores or nail salon where it was applied. Ordered it through this website and was extremely happy with low pricing, availability, and how quickly it arrived (sooner than quoted!). Would definitely order from this website again without any reservations."
1,"OPI Argenteeny Pinkini.. color is off, wrong!","I *LOVE* OPI, but this color is not what I have bought before in a store.. this is much more beige.. holding the bottles together one looks like a subtle soft natural elegant pink, the other (this one) looks almost brownish. OPI Argenteeny Pinkini is not meant to be beige, if you do a google search for images of this color, it is SUPPOSED to be very elegant. The product I received is not! It's dull and lifeless."
4,beautiful color / fast service,"Very pretty color. Seems to chips easily, but good just be my top coat. Shipped fast, arrived in one piece. Perfect for fall."
3,Chipped,I love the color of this nail polish. I tried it and it chipped very easily. I treated my cuticles with oil just before I put it on. That might have caused it to not adhere good enough. I will try again. I love the color soooo much.
2,Not worth it!,"After reading some of the reviews about OPI nail polish, I became obsessed with the brand. I went to get a manicure and on the SAME DAY (I'm not exaggerating) it chipped from one nail. The manicure did not last me a week (3 days tops). Very disappointing, waste of money. FYI: When I use Duri or Essie nail polish, it ALWAYS last for more than 5 days!"
3,Looks black!,"I was really excited about getting this color thinking it would be a rich dark green. I figured it might look almost black because of how dark of green it is but I was surprised at how black it seems. Unlike the picture when I got the bottle it appears black, not green. I cant even read the wording on the bottle. The first coat I put on came out as a nice green but was way to uneven and streaky to go without a second coat. After I applied the second coat it looked absolutely black. Nice color but you may want to use with caution."
3,Great color!,"So, I love OPI nail polish. I'm a huge puple fan! So, great combo for me. Unfortunately, this nail polish showed up half empty for leaking while closed tightly. Odd and disappointing! I used the rest as quickly as possible, because, as I guessed, this polish dried up quickly! Maybe it was just a faulty bottle, but I was so sad!"
3,Ok pale pink,"I'm a bit sad because I thought this nail polish would be a bit more opaque than it was. It took 3 coats for it to be fully opaque. It is pretty on, but not what I thought it would be. It also is really easy to make this polish look bad. If you mess it up at all, get it on your cuticles, chip it, it looks just horrible. I probably would not repurchase this."
3,Not a full Product,I have been coveting this product for over a year now. I absolutely love the color. Would repurchase in a heartbeat if I could find another. My only problem with this was that the ad made me think this was a full bottle of polish and its not. It's at least half gone and for the price I paid I was expected more product. I feel mislead.
5,OPI I'm Really Not A Waitress,"OPI I'm Really Not A Waitress is a beautiful color, and I am very pleased with the product and service from this vendor."
5,Wonderful color!,"I love, love, love this color. It is so rich and regal looking. I was a little concerned that it would be overwhelming when I first saw it but I was pleasantly surprised after applying the second coat."
1,Not as Expected,"I bought this product several times previously and loved the color. The color of the nail polish I received from Amazon is completely different from the color of previous purchases of ""I'm Really Not a Waitress"". Why?"
5,Love the coverage,this was perfect nail polish for what I was wanting to do.It only took two coats. It Shipped fast and the packaging was nice.
2,nail polish used,Recived product fast nail polish bottle had polish on it look used.THE reason I gave a 2 was fast service. I will keep it I dont know if i will order from them again.
5,Fun color,I love this fun color. True to the color on the website. Goes on smoothly with the usual OPI quality and dries beautifully.
5,Best Platinum Nail Polish Around,"I love OPI polish (doesn't chip on my nails) and have probably tried 300 different colors over the years. I keep going back to this one because it is the best platinum polish I have found. There are other brands, and even other OPI colors in the range, but for me, this is the best."
5,"Bright rose pink, beautiful and cheeful","I love this colour. It's a gorgeous hue of pink, really makes you feel summery. And OPI is the best nail varnish as a product."
3,okay...,"Beware when buying any light nail polish color, no matter the brand! I usually really like OPI because it's simply the best quality, but this color, not so much. I think it's hard to make a decent light pink color because it requires so little pigment that the formula becomes watery. When you try to apply it, and pools at the corners of your nails. Once you get around that, though, the color is nice, a nice light pink that's not over the top and could almost be whitish -- the picture really doesn't do it justice. Bottom line is I gave it 3 stars because the quality is not good, but if you're desperate for this color, like I am, it IS your best option."
4,Two colours in one!,This is a delicious colour! It's both hot pink and purple depending on the light. The formula is impeccable. Mani lasted a full week with no chips. Get this colour for summer!
5,Really pretty color,The color is very in and pretty i love it wear it alot before the season is over.... cause it's very dark but I really love it
2,Not at all as expect it,"This product is very stick and very hard to use. It cost lumps all the time, basically it is very bad quality. waste of time and money."
3,eehhh,I have dark asian skin. This color didn't really pop that much on my skin tone. Looks great on the fair skinned model though!
2,"Color is ""Meh""","This is a boring, almost flat pink. It looks okay after you put it on but within a day or two starts to look bad. I would definitely not use it on my toes again. Fingers might be okay."
2,Yuck,"The color looks nothing like the picture. I love this brand, but they did a poor job with the picture of this one. It looks like a pink-grape color...which is pretty ugly in my opinion."
5,Great Sequel...As Good As The First!!,"Cecelia Holland has written a great sequel to her book RAILROAD SCHEMES!! This books has very lovalbe characters, a great story line and is full of real San Francisco history!!"
3,"Famous Photographer, Nameless Children","These stunning portraits of displaced and refugee children are dismaying. They provoke an immediate response: grief, and then - one hopes - an immediate check in the mail to ""Doctors without Borders"" or a comparable international relief organization. What seems strange and distressing, however, is the intentional namelessness of each child. Each startling and heartbreaking portrait is captionless. Maybe Salgado believed them to be more effective, that way. You check the terse notes at the back of the book. The subject, in this case a boy missing an arm, stares forthrightly as the photogrpapher. He is identified as (for example): ""38. The Natinga School Camp for displaced Sudanese. Southern Sudan, 1995."" This Euro-bureaucratese is followed through-out. Each child is unnamed by the author, and this is a failing of this book, and one which serves to reinforce the initial crimes committed against these young people."
4,Good book,It broke down the dosage calculations very well especially for someone who hates math. Was a good buy overall. Helpful
1,suck suck suck,"Everything from the lyrics to the musicianship to the vocals are less than average in execution. Although, I do have this positive thing to say about !!!, they work well for those of us who suffer from insomnia. The music is so derivative, played-out, unoriginal that it puts one to sleep."
5,Best Single Of 2003? Highly Likely!,"Remember the first time you heard ""Pump Up The Volume"" by MARRS? Remember how you couldn't stop listening to it? Or ""Blue Monday"" by New Order, for that matter? This is that kind of record. Actually, this track sounds like it *was* recorded in the 80s, subsequently lost in a space-time continuum, and re-emerged the other side in 2003. I hear so many 80s influences here - New Order, Gang of Four, Liquid Liquid, James White, Cabaret Voltaire, late-era Clash. It's simply an outstanding record that fires on all eight cylinders for the duration. Expect to see this on a lot of ""best of"" lists at the end of the year."
3,OK so what do we have here?,"The best single of 2003 and a throwaway remix track off theyre last LP. Should I give it 5 stars or 1? I guess I'll split the difference. Six bucks is deffiantely worth it though based on the strengthof the first track but i think that money would be better spent checking them out in concert, its suck a good time."
3,Not scholarly enough,"This DVD fulfills a need for a documentary on the subject. Commentaries by foremost scholars were most welcome, however the scenes showing life in a modern context were, I feel inappropriate for a documentary on the ancient world.There should have been more coverage of the ancient artworks relevant to the period, and more detailed aspects of Nero's principate."
4,A good rock bio...this is rare!,"Probably the only book you'll ever need on one of the century's most important rock artists. That does count for something. This mind-boggling exhaustive treatment runs through 500 pages of text, and then dives into a 200-page appendix that details Hendrix's vast recorded output. The writing style is plain and unpretentious and gives you the straight facts on his career. The only downside is that the appendix is poorly organized and unindexed, making it difficult to find anything. Also, there could have been more analysis and discussion on Hendrix's contributions as a composer."
4,"Fantastic, yet strangely empty","The research is wonderful, the prose style is just fine, the detail is remarkable - I finished the book knowing more than I ever felt I needed to know about Jimi (and being grateful for the knowledge) yet no closer to any understanding as to what made the man tick. Any serious Hendrix fan must own this book, but it is, in an odd way - emotionally incomplete."
5,A great introduction at length to the Hendrix phenomenon,"Although no biography of Jimi Hendrix can ever claim to be ""Definitive"", this book is extremely thorough, covers just about every angle you could want, and is chock full of pictures."
3,If a 6 were a 9,"Lots of details. Lots of pictures. An okay place to start learning about Hendrix. Where do the authors go wrong? Hendrix was more than a musician with one chart single who influenced thousands of others; more than an icon for the 60s. There was a special delicate magic surrounding Hendrix, a spirit of experiment and discovery that begs for more than a scattered accounting of the facts ma'am, and demands more attention to the -music-. Electric Gypsy misses the wagon on both counts."
5,Great Bio of Hendrix,"I've read several books about the life of Jimi Hendrix and this is by far the best. Well written and researched, it is engaging and engrossing. Even the reference materials are facsinating. A great book about a very interesting life."
4,Excellent narrative,"I bought this book along with a book about Jane Addams and HullHouse. Hilda writes an honest, extremely interesting, straight forward tale of her own life, and the part Jane Addams played in it. At times I felt as if I was there at Hull House with her, so clear was her portrait. I walked the streets of turn of the century Chicago with her, and shared her joys and sorrows. The only thing I wish the author had included was more about members of her family and their day to day life. But otherwise, a highly interesting portrait of a remarkable woman."
1,Excellent series,"As a 46 year old, I remember to this day devouring the Encyclopedia Brown series at the local library. Many times, I checked out the book, read it cover to cover, and returned it the same day.And now my 4th grade daughter is hooked on the series. She is just like me... she can't get enough. She loves trying to solve the mysteries. We highly recommend Encyclopedia Brown."
4,Worth Your Time,"This mystery takes place in downtown Idaville.Encyclopedia brown is the main chazracter who solves the mystery's for kids and adults.Cericeo is a minor charactor who tries to find out how seamen really behave, he has a play were he is a sailor.A problem accurs when he goes into a restaraunt with the sailors and pays for his meal and there is only a 2 cents tip so he leaves under the crowd and starts running down the street.The cook calls out to him that he'll fix him good so the boy is scared .The mystery is solved when Encyclopedia is the one to sort out the problem."
2,lasted one year,"After about six months, the toothbrush became difficult to turn off. Then one night we were awoken by a noise coming from the bathroom. It was the toothbrush, which spontaneously and intermittently turned on as if being used by a ghost. At least the manufacturer gave us a coupon for a new one."
4,I am Happy with Toothbrush,"Toothbrush works well. I went on trip for 7 days, without charger, and it lasted fine. Nice pink color too."
3,"I did not receive the advertised product but the ""Vitality"" toothbrush instead which has a different charging base.","The seller shipped me a ""Vitality"" braun toothbrush - not the advertised 950TX that I had ordered. This was a bummer as I had planned to give this as an X-mas gift and was not able since it was the wrong product. The Vitality toothbrush can be found at Kohl's and many drugstores. I ordered from this seller because I was expecting to get the 950TX. I already have a 950TX and am very pleased and this is why I requested this specific product. The seller did refund my payment after the product was returned. Would not order from this seller again as it seemed to be a bate & switch scenario.This review is more of the seller than the product itself which I very much like.The review options don't really cover this particular scenario in which I was shipped a product different from what I ordered."
4,good toothbrush,I needed a replacement for my last Oral-B that was dropped and broke. This is a great value. It has two speeds and the two-minute timer which are very nice features.
2,wishful thinking,This unit has Not performed as expected.it holds a charge if you intend to use it every other day.I brush daily so obviously it is not working for me but wish it was.communication sent through Amazon.com apparently has not reached the seller but will phone them direct to see what Can be done. Disappointed but hopefully not for long
5,i look forward to brushing my teeth,this makes me happy. my dentist told me to get one. it works as advertised. i like to brush my teeth and i even floss now since i don't have to do the back and forth with an old fashioned toothbrush. the 2 minute timer gives me some sense of accomplishment.
5,Made in Germany!,"I have a similar model without the timer that started making strange noises after 6 years of ownership. That model was made in Germany and was very satisfied with the durability and hoped this new one is made in Germany as well. It is, and I know that this one should last 5 or more years as well."
4,Great toothbrush,"Oral-B AdvancePower 980TX Rechargeable ToothbrushMy husband and I have used this excellent toothbrush for many years, also approved and recommended by our dentist.The only complaint I have is that the packaging is extrememly difficult to open. One could easily slice a finger or puncture the product, because a scissor or tool is required to open it!"
2,Power brush w/o enough power,"The Braun Oral-B Advanced Power 950 was disappointing vs. the older model (Plak Control Ultra) I've used for years; that one had a green light to tell you it's charging. This lacks not only the light, but the power of the original; it also runs down quicker and recharges more slowly. Overall, I'd say the cost-cutters got to it."
4,Electric Toothbrush & Shipping,"This item replaced an identical one that I had which worked well, but in my opinion failed prematurely as it wouldn't hold a charge. Hopefully the replacement will last longer.One big disappointment is that the shipping charge for a small item at $8.95 is too high, over half the cost of the toothbrush."
4,Braun Oral-B D9513/AP950TX,This product lives up to the Braun Oral B name. The price was very competitive.
4,Leo's review on Braun Oral-B,"The service was effective and delivery was on promised schedule. The product is working fine. We had Braun products before and like its reliability. The Amazon online service may be a bit over efficient. When I recieved my e-mail notice, I noticed two e-mails per product I ordered. They were duplicated order and there was no way to cancel, but Amazon customer services took care of the cancellation later. I only got one product per ordering."
4,Good deal for the price,"This is my second one as the other one crapped out after a few years. Although it appears to have lasted longer for others, its still a good deal and do recommend to family and friends."
1,Oral - B D9513/AP950TX Advance Power 950 TX Electric Tooth bush wit Compact,I had to return it didn't work
4,Good Jazzy funky Asian-based tunes,Going to Nomads in Amsterdam is a unique experience and this cd reflects that. The relaxed environment to dine and the very open-minded and cultural awerness of the Dutch make of this place an invigorating experience. Carefully selected tunes that create an incredible atmosphere to chat and relax.
4,"Fine card, but packaging could be nicer.","I've tried this brand and the Lexar Media brand (which purportsto have 4x speed) and have found no appreciable difference inday-to-day usage. This seems like a fine card.My only complaint about the New Media Tech cards is that the plastic card holder cases are physically much larger than they need to be and the way the card snaps into the case is a bit of a pain. If you carry and swap a couple of cards, this is a minor inconvenience."
4,Beginners Luck!,"With the writing skill and creativity this rapper has, it won't belong before he creates a master-piece. Keep on pushin youngsta!I give a star;1-for music1-for writing skills1-for creativity1-for tryingYou'll make home-boy."
3,"Good, not great","Picky, picky, picky I know, but I was thrown from the beginning quote by Erasmus who lived 400+ years after the story's setting. Then, if you forget the title of the book, don't worry. You'll be reminded throughout the story ad naseum. That being said, the characters were distinctive, clearly defined, although Faith seemed a bit contemporary. The story moved easily and it was an enjoyable escape."
4,I haven't even finished,"This book is great and definitely a keeper. Donna FLetcher gives the reader of stubborn pride but even stronger love. I enjoyed all the characters and she goes in depth making the reader a part of their family. Fletcher gives a tale of a women who will not be broken down and a warrior whose might makes everyone quiver including the heroine, but not in fear. As they fight against the odds their love strengthens. The secondary characters are wonderful and I cannot wait for her next book."
5,enchanting,"This was an excellant story, great plot, great subplot, great characters, and i hope the next in the series is as well written and sticks with the personalities of the characters. You want a book that you can let out a long *sigh* when finished? this is it."
1,I can't believe the 5 stars are real,"Come on. You've got to be kidding. This lady couldn't pass freshman English, let alone get published (and I would really, really like to know how that happened). The guy in this book is a self-centered dork, with no redeeming qualities. The lady is ok, except for her judgment in men. The plot is stupid, the writing is less than sophomoric--how, please could this get a 5 star rating unless her friends are writing in? No kidding, this book is so bad, it's embarrassing! Please don't encourage her. She needs to keep her day job."
5,THE Exchange 2000 Book for Email/Directory Pros,"I've been working in messaging and directory services for a decade, and this is the first book I've found that dives behind the Exchange GUIs to tell me what is actually going on. I can't recommend it highly enough, especially for those who are already comfortable with X.500, LDAP, and SMTP services."
2,All you ever wanted to know about the ADC and SMTP,"I don't know which of the two authors knows SMTP and which knows ADC, but it's obvious that the two topics form the cornerstone of this book. The authors are happy to discuss their pet topics but give relatively little attention to anything else. Because of this, the book reads like an in-depth discussion of attribute mapping between the Exchange DS and the Active Directory followed by a review of how messages find their way through the routing engine. If you're happy with that, buy the book, but if you expect to learn more about how Exchange interoperates with Windows and IIS (both pretty fundamental points for infrastructure) and how to protect Exchange 2000 in a secure manner, go elsewhere."
1,Do not buy this book,"I made the mistake of buying this book. It is a fast and I imagine cheap update of the Corel Draw 8 Bible. The chapters have been minimally edited so that it refers to outmoded Corel 8 entities that are not in Corel 9, for example the Natural Pen vs the Artistic Media tool. I can't return the book because I made the mistake of opening the CD. I wish I could. The book is a waste. Buy something else."
4,Good,This book is good book especially if you are serious about Corel Draw. Yes it includes a couple of mistakes like refering to the Artistic Tool as Natural Pen but if you have any sense of reasoning or logic whatsoever it is a no brainer it took me 2 mins to figure it out.
3,Cute in the package but not durable out!,The product is all taped together and when you try to take the tape off - it rips the papers. The stamp pads are junk. All of the stuff is cute to look at and my 5 year old daughter likes it.
4,She'd been gone - but never forgotten,"Another fabulous story from talented author Christy Lockhart.A story of amnesia, betrayal, and broken promises. A story of redemption and second chances.Don't miss it!"
1,absolutely horrible,"waste of time, effort, planning, resources and the forty-two cents i spent on this cd - it is absolutely horrible - i only hope that the used cd store nearby will give me at least one penny"
1,not good dont waste your time,I purchase to of these that where on clearence and one arrived and never worked the other broke in a matter of days . Its very small and doesnt work good at all dont waste your money
4,Good Plot Twists but Has Technical Inaccuracies,"While Mr. Palmer may have extensive experience in the medical sciences, he reveals that he has little knowledge of handguns and associated weaponry. What is even more surprising is that these inaccuracies were not caught by his fact-checker/editor.While am by no means an expert in the field, please allow me to pass along some guidelines:A revolver has no safety switch - it is inherently safe. A revolver is (typically) never fitted with a silencer due to it being ineffective. There are no (typical) 9mm revolvers.An automatic does have a safety switch. An automatic can be silenced. An automatic is not a revolver.Other than these obvious oversights, it was a well-written novel.Randy Venier San Diego, CA"
5,Kick Butt!,This was a truly satisfying read. Lots of surprises that I could see coming only a few pages before they hit me smack between the eyes. Easily one of the best books I've read in a long time.
3,"Great story, horribly assembled","I really enjoyed this story, but I am puzzled by the myriad errors. Periods in the middle of sentences, the wrong word being used (substituted with a word that rhymes or has the same amount of letters), etc. They probably used OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software to transfer this from another medium. It looks more like someone read the book into audio recognition software. In the end, no one proof-read the manuscript and it shows. Very annoying."
3,I couldn't get into it,I was really looking forward to this book after reading the reviews on here but I couldn't get into it. I stopped after the first 100 pages. I am glad that I checked it out of the library and didn't buy it.
4,A medical thriller!,"I loved this book. Harry was a ""human"" character. I liked him. My goodness he went through alot. but he prevailed. The book was a fair balance of good and evil. I found the medical details very interesting. ""The Doctor"" was a totally scarry formidable foe!"
3,Zilent Treatment,"Great read. Full of suspense, def. another page turning thrill ride by Michael Palmer. One of my favorites by him. Can't wait for the next one!@"
1,Fauci is a junk scientist,Fauci is a very poor scientist. He lets his own political beliefs bias his medical opinions. As he has been in high positions in NIH this serves to greatly retard medical science and cause much suffering to disabled Americans. An example is his steadfast support of the Dr. Mengele of modern medicine Stephen Straus in his disinformation campaign on ME (aka CFS).
4,Pretty good,"Pros:-- It works fast and toasts evenly.-- There's plenty of room for larger items such as a big bagel.-- The defrost setting works well on sliced bread from the freezer.-- The bagel setting toasts mainly from the inside, which is also handy for other things like rolls.Cons:-- It should be easier to remove things after toasting. The lever doesn't allow me to lift things out of the toaster far enough. It's ok for supermarket bread, but other things I have to grab with a fork.-- It's substantially bigger than I expected. The picture makes it look slimmer than it is; I would like it to take less space on my counter."
3,Nice but...,"I like the looks of this although it does seem a bit too big. I like that it slopes down.It doesn't seem to toast well, though. It seems like it takes a long time for things to brown. Much longer than my old dollar store toaster...which honestly was a better toaster.It's ok. Maybe after I use it for a while I might change my mind."
1,Toaster is Very Poor at Toasting,"Purchased a Farberware toaster as we have always been satisfied with Farberware products. Toaster, even set at the highest setting, does not toast evenly nor does it toast much at all. One side of the toast gets a little brown and the other just has scratches of light toasting. The lining heating wires inside the toaster are not all tight = not a danger but poor workmanship. When the toast pops (unfinished, of course), it leaves the toaster."
3,"Boring, repetitive, only for the Dynasty Warriors' hardcore fans","First of all easy achievemants, I believe I got around 920/1000. But the game is the same thing over and over for 100 battles. The graphics are decent and there are a crap load of characters but they are all basically made from same 20 molds just with 200+ faces. Stick to the normal Dynasty Warriors and erase Empires from your mind. If you're a hardcore fan you'll love this game, if you're a casual fan you'd shoot yourself in the head if it wasn't for the achievemants."
3,I don't really like this game,"It's a good game, and I really liked it when I was a kidBut when I get older, I found out that this game is basically forcing us to do something over and over againIt feels good to use the character to keep winning..but it's too much repetition... I get headache after playing the same thing again and again"
3,Meh...,Good seller. Confusing game. It's a lot harder to understand how to play than the previous Dynasty Warriors games.
1,Avoid! Snorsville!,This game is awful. They attempted to make it both a fighting game and a strategy game and completely failed at both. I was tired of it in about ten minutes. No wonder the price dropped so fast on this one. It bites.
3,"It is perfect for some applications, not for all","This case is perfect for those who need to store their home videos, computer software, or anything custom made considering that the pocket intended to store the DVD Cover/Documentation is slightly smaller than the standard cover itself, so what happens is that you need to bend it a little bit. If you are storing your favorite movie's collection (like me) you'll have a hard time inserting the front face. Other than that, the 120 DVD capcity is perfect, as well as the size of the binder pages. I am still looking for the best solution to my case."
5,Great Buy! Lots of Storage,I am very happy with this purchase. I have lots of storage and it is alot more durable than the last case I purchased that fell apart. I was able to put my movies and the dvd inserts (only having to cut a few). I love not having piles of dvd cases all over the place. I also take this on long family trips. I just grab it and go. The kids have all the movies they want on our long trips. It is easier to keep track of than a bunch of dvd case flying around. I highly recommend this case.
4,not just any old stump,"This book was read read to me throughout my childhood, so i am saddened to see such a short synopsis. Granted that is the essence of the story, but what is most important about it, is the sense of interconnectedness in nature that Nathalia illustrates. Many different organisms live in a less glamorous way and often go underappreciated in environmental texts. It's about time that bugs and worms had their say, too. I thoroughly recommend it."
5,What a surprise!,"I bought this CD by accident. Not sure what it would sound like. The next day I listened to it on the way home from work and I was so caught up in the music I almost missed by turn. Yes, some songs don't work, but most do. Understand Your Man, Paradise, Stop The World are highlights. I don't understand the criticism of ""I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide"". Great cover."
4,Tanks of World War II,"I bought this as a gift. They seemed to really like it, so I gave it 4 stars.The disappointment I have is that I paid $30 for the book and when it arrived, it had a price sticker on the back that read $13.95. You can only imagine how I feel about this."
4,Excellant printer but the rebate has expired,The price to performance ratio is excellant. Print speed and quality appear to better that other more expensive vendors. The rebate has expired on this product on 7-10-99. The rebate did influence my decision to buy. The printer is still a bargain at this price but I am disappointed in the marketing of this product with the rebate prominently mentioned. Buyer Beware!
4,Great home-use printer for the price,"Excellent print quality, both color & black ink. The black cartidge lasts a lot longer than the color (we averaged 300 to 400 pages to a cartridge for black ink; approximately 200 for the color). We found the cover (to access the printer cartridge somewhat difficult to open). We plan on upgrading to the BJC-2000 in the near future."
1,OK if you can get one for $50 or less,Worked fine for a couple of years then one day just stopped responding. Price for used one is outrageous. Price for cartridges is equally outrageous. Get a refill kit from Sams' Club.
2,"sory, i dont like this one.","slow, expensive to run, poor resolution. best to by an epson. cheaper cartridges, faster printing and much more reliable. sorry canon!"
1,What a hunk of crap,Sucked. Clunky piece of junk. Though it only cost me potatos to buy... but it cost me a forture to operate. If you own one do yourself a favor and through it out with the empty ink and buy something economical. $35 for black and it prints... no it bleed ink onto the paper at a rate of 500 pages per tank... AHHHHHH! That's scary. 7 cents a page. Canon please bend me over and take my money.
1,Not even close,"Well, I ordered this, and received a stupid USB-to-Mini instead. Can't recommend these guys."
1,Disapointment!!,I am a fan of both goofy and serious horror movies but this fails to fall into either catagory. It was too lame to be serious and not funny enough to be entertaining. Your money would be better spent buying something like Dead Alive or Evil Dead.
4,an excellent peice of crap,"oasis of the zombies is considered by most people to be the worst zombie film ever. when looked at technically it is, but when looked at as a horror film, i think it suceeds if not excells. the movie is about college kids searching for lost nazi gold in the desert. as you could probably expect, theyre attacked and killed by the undead nazis who are gaurding the gold. the zombies themselves look pretty cool. the makeup is done very well for a film with such a small budget. there is only one gore scene which is when the zombies tear out a womens intestines. the films biggest problem is its pacing. the film is very boring at times. also, the films overall quality is low. if you can just ignore the crappy quality and be patient through the boring parts, you may find yourself enjoying this little gem. it may be a peice of crap, but its an excellent peice of crap."
2,More Eurotrash from Franco,"This is a re-edited version of the Franco's earlier ""La Tumba de los Muertos vivientes"". It's not one of Franco's best, lacking the sex and violence and monster mayhem of some of other work, but the zombie scenes are OK and complete with maggot-faced creatures shuffling through the sand. Quite dull, but hopefully the start of a long long long series of Eurocine films!"
3,not too bad,This movie has had a lot of negative reviews. Andsometimes rightfully so. But it not the worstzombie movie by far. If ur into Euro Horror andbudget zombie flicks than buy this. At leastto add to your collection.
2,zombie Oasis,"Another one that I thought might be decent turned out to be a dud. This is an hour plus of people running around trying to find some secret treasure and 15 minutes of similar looking people with mud on their faces moving very, very slowly. You may turn into a zombie from watching this crap."
2,Midnight At The Oasis,"this piece of undead unhealthy guilty pleasure was almost entirely shot on location at the Maspalomas Dunes in the Canary Islands- rent it, if only for that incredible opening with the girls- you must hear them dubbed in spanish- messing round the oasis in shorts and high heels!!"
1,Just when you thought you'd seen the worst.....,"This is one the worst zombie films ever made. One would think given that it's one of those rare films to cross Nazi soliders with zombies that it would be great, but it makes Zombie Lake look like an oscar contender and Shock Waves a masterpiece. Some of the zombie effect are so bad you can see the eye-slits in the rubber masks. Once again, buy this one only if your a completest and need every zombie film in your personal collection. Check out Peter Jackson's Dead Alive or Fulci's classic Zombie before you decide to throw your money away on this poor attempt at a horror film."
1,Oasis of Bad Movies,"The movie is so bad that it even has bad cinematography! However, it is a must have if you collect these old zombie movies. Night of the Living Dead wasn't in Panavision either, you know!It is a fun movie that you can watch with friends and make sarcastic remarks about!"
1,And it looked so good by the description!,"I got this movie in a big compilation of fifty horror films. I expected quite a few to be bad; bad in the MST3K sense... but this? This movie's just bad. I'll spare you from the general plot overview, as that tends to make the movie sound awesome. What I will tell you is that this movie takes forever to get going. Despite seeing zombie hands within the first five minutes, you don't see them again for a long time. So long, in fact, that I don't think I've ever stayed awake long enough to see!I honestly can't recomend this movie to anyone. It's like watching the original ""Day of the Dead"" But not the first ten minutes, when there's zombies... or the last twenty, when there's zombie inside the mall. This movie is like watching all the boring ""mall"" scenes from ""Day of the Dead"" sans zombies...."
3,"So Bad, It's Not Good, It's Still Bad!","This movie is soooo bad I can't explain it to you! It's about some people looking for lost gold in the damn desert but find something else! Hmm, what do they find? FLESHEATING ZOMBIES!!!!!Good story? Very cheap, bad dubbing, what film has good dubbing eh? Though this film had Some good looking zombies. There was only 1 gory scene in this movie, when they rip that girl apart and eat her guts. This movie looks very weird and cheap. I paid $65 for mine, I have a very rare version of the film. I gave this a 3 because I don't really hate it that much but I don't like it. If your a fan of cheap zombie movies, enjoy!"
3,Painfully Generic sci-fi/telepath story,"If you like mediocre stories of telepaths loose on an unsuspecting planet you'll love this. Otherwise buy sometihng else. This is a book easilly summed up in a few sentances. Evil, wicked, bad, mean, and nasty guy with tlepatic powers lands on a backwater planet and tries to carve himself out an empire. His nice, friendly, kind, and likeable younger brother, the main charactor, sets out to catch him. The main charactor befriends some natives, finds a latent telepth, and winds up killing the bad man. painfully generic, I've read to many book like this to get excited about. some are a lot better written."
5,Sci-fi at it's peak,"Though some of the themes in this book are familiar in other works, Vesser adds new material that are normally hard to find. The characters are relatable, but most importantly, believable in their relationships with others. And for the most part, I was caught in the ride of plot and story that Vesser spun from beginning to finish.I read a book to escape the world and Vesser did just that. An excellent story, this is. One that I can highly recommend."
2,Not quite what I expected,The cover and size of these books are just about right. They could be a little larger. However the cheap paper and the perforated pages make this product less than desirable. I will not buy these again.
2,Cheap quality...too expensive!,"When my Blueline NotePro arrived this morning, I was truly disappointed. Very cheap paper and for the money, not worth it! I was going to use it as a journal, since I prefer the quad paper, but it's just too cheap looking.Save your money."
3,good item,"Good item, but not what my architect was looking for so had to make use of it regardless. Good price. Good to work with! I recommend!"
3,Pretty good,"These are pretty nice... when I remember to use them. Hard to find time to sit with my feet up! Overall, they stretch my toes well. I can't speak to their long-term effects, as I didn't utilize them fully. Maybe you'll have better luck!"
4,Great CD,This was purchase for my father for his birthday and he enjoyed and also enjoyed the fact of the lyrics that was also included with this CD.
4,Sting,"Nice replica, very sharp. Not for use for anything other then display. Good conversational piece, for fans of LOTR trilogy."
4,"As good as it gets, if you din't have your OWN elvish blacksmith!","United Cutlery outdid themselves on the whole LOTR/Hobbit line of replica weapons. My brother has them all (LOTR), and they are simply awesome! This is my daughter's first movie prop sword, and it is hard to put down!Yes, it is rather light, but an elvish blade SHOULD be light! It doesn't glow, even when my son's obviously orcish friends come over... but for the price it is a beautiful wall hanger (which you will keep taking down to touch).Get the scabbard, too! They look incredible togerher, even without the knee length pants, white shirt and green vest! And furry feet!"
5,Top Quality Replica,"Amazing sword, amazing quality, amazing price! This is a very high quality product. This sword has a good weight, and is made to very high standards. In the photo it is a little hard to tell but the the runes on the blade are engraved, not laser etched or silk screened like some other cheaper replicas. This sword is well worth the money. You will not regret your decision to buy this sword.As a side note for those of you who like to know the blade arrived with a razor sharp edge. A little to sharp for wall hanger in my opinion. it was however very east to slightly dull the edge with a little careful work with emery cloth. It did not ruin the look but it would now be a challenge to cut yourself with it. Even with these modifications this is an adult collectors item and I would not reccomend it for children or teens. This is not a toy, it is a real sword and should be treated as such."
1,Pitiful Essays/decent Knoxville,"very sad to say it, but this orchestra which i've always admired puts in a very bad job of sightreading the 2nd and 3rd essays. unbelievable to me that marin and producers would allow these readings to go on disc. barber's 2nd essay is just about my favorite of his works to play and listen to and i was nearly sick at how lost various principals sound on this! knoxville is fine, but this disc pales in comparison for instance to Levi/Atlanta Symph/McNair.stay away from it as honestly Alsop only satisfies in this series with RSNO, on the Capricorn Cncto offering!!"
2,Get what you pay for,"For an almost $5.00 ornament, it is what it is- tiny, which is told in the description. I felt as if the ornament needed to be ""jazzed"" up, so I put the year ""2010"" on the bat. The ball was dirty and nothing could take whatever it was off of the ball. If you are looking to realy ""WOW"" that special Red Sox fan, this is not the item for that person."
4,Faith conqueors all,"Perley Poore Sheehan is - apart by a small group of afficianados - probably largely forgotten - but undeservedly so. The Passport Invisible again shows his strength as a writer who can imbue even the most unlikely set of circumstances with a sense of spirituality and magic.This is a story of a most unlikely secret agent, who travels across WWI Europe with a set of papers which will determine whether or not the USA will join in this war. The style of writing is absolutely unique in creating an atmosphere in which the most unlikely becomes possible and even probable. And it leaves you with a sense of optimism, that indeed faith conqueors all - which we certainly can use these days, in which a financial crisis seems to crush the human spirit. In addition the book is very nicely produced."
3,Buy it if UR rich,"Its size appealed me and I bought this, only to regret later. First, the cartridge ran out of ink before 50 pages were printed. So, I had to buy new one for $49.99. The size of the cartridge is very small and costs more. If you are running NT, definitely do not buy this. The software will not let you print monochrome docs with BC60 (black only) cartridge. Also, I ran into problems that the fax/print will not terminate even if I pressed stop button. Scanner is impressive, but be very patient. Answering machine function is fine. To switch to Fax/Tel you have to go back to the software to change - would have been better if it was one of the functions on the machine."
3,not a great product,"The printer, copy, and scan functions all work great. I have only tried to fax a couple times and couldn't get it to work. The ink cartridges run dry frequently, one went out in only 11 days. I am not sure if it is because the cartridge dries that fast or because the print head gets clogged quickly and thinks its dry. Even with cleaning the print head it still runs out of ink too fast."
2,Slow as molasses and awkward,"This is not an easy machine to use. It is much slower than my Epson 640 printer. Also, the basic setup encumbers your computer with a lot of cumbersome software. I recently ran a scan that took forever and afterwards some of my other programs were corrupted and had to be reloaded. If you don't do too much printing, this machine may be ok for you, but as a workhorse it's fairly poor."
4,Not conpatable with XP operating system.,"This multipass C5500 is a very good all-in-one machine. I recently purchased a new Dell computer, but this machine is not compatable with the XP os. I need to sell this one and buy another multifunction that will work with my new computer. I have the original box it came in, the software, documents and extra black cartridge still in the package, unopened, that goes to the successful buyer. This machine is in excellant condition and have never had any problems with it . I am the only owner. I purchased it new. Thank you for your interest. Daniel Rogers"
2,"All in all, disapointing.","The BJC-6000, is probably one of the slowest printers(at high resolutions), that I've ever had the displeasure in using. The colors are dull, and no matter how much you tinker with it, it just won't get any brighter. The only real pro to this over-sized printer is it's ability to print lazer-quality b/w."
1,"Having mechanical problems, just after a year.","It only worked for a little over a year, and beeps six times. The troubleshooting guide, says replace ink, and I did, and problem still exists. Now I am stuck with a bad printer with extra ink. Would not recommend."
1,My first and last Canon product,"I've had nothing but problems with this printer since the day I bought it. The colors don't even look close to what you see on the screen. The ink cartridges leak everwhere. Blue and yellow stripes print over the image. I've deep cleaned the cartridges, check the nozzles, and done everthing else they recommended but it still doesn't work. As soon as I get enough money to buy another printer I plan on taking a sledge hammer to this one!"
1,Inkstained in St. Louis,"Had same problem as Kimberly King of Abiline-the dreaded 6 beeps!When new ink didnt solve it,I checked the pads under the ink-cartridge.They were dry,so I made sure they got saturated. All is well,and the printer is ok for now.LATER-it keeps happening!Put a bullit in it! Got to find a better printer."
2,Cannon 6000 Review,"I purchased the Cannon BJ6000 because of the comments I read at the time and because there was a $50 rebate. I am disappointed in the quality of the pictures printed using the Photo cartridge ($50) and the photo quality glossy paper. You must ""deep clean"" the heads each time you install the photo cartridge to get the best possible picture, which is about 60% the quality of 35mm prints and very slow (about 3 minutes per picture). The colors are not true to the digital picture. Also, if you don't use the cartridge up in a short time the quality gets worse. The black and white printing is fine, except the cartridges do not last very long, even with little printing. ... Good Luck."
2,Cannon BJC 6000 Printer,"This printer has worked very well up until the time I wanted to buy photo quality cartridges. Where, on this planet, can I get them? It's inexcusable to market a printer, claim it to be photo quality, then not provide the accessories to print photos. I'm ready to return my printer to the store where I bought it and demand an exchange for something I can get accessories for. What a joke!"
4,Good printer by all means,"I bought the BJC 6000 in mid of 1999 ... I am happy I invested so much money on it. It work very well. With the photo ink and top photo paper, I can have close to real prints. All the limitation is the image itself. The money I spent on inks has exceed the [amount] for the printer itself.The interface was in parallel, so some of my observation may not apply for USB version. The first page is always fast, but the next one will have to wait, and wait (For what?). That is the only cons I found and complain about. The speed is kind of slow at top quality, hey, that is acceptable. :)The individual ink is a big plus. I found myself changing yellow more frequently then the other two.Finally, the i850 seems to use the same inks as the BJC6000, which means i850 can't exceed the quality on the horizon direction."
2,Thank goodness its been discontinued,"At first everything worked fine, then it stopped feeding paper. I took it to a repair shop and it never worked the same. It was a constant source of frustration. Finally I just beat it to death."
4,thus far a good printer,"I wanted to submit 3 stars, but that seemed unfair, given the 6000's quality. A pain to assemble, it has lots and lots of neatly organized gadgets that eventually render a nice printer. Astonishingly, it comes boxed without a cable. In this day of customer-friendly packaging, you'd expect to open it up and find everything you need, ready to go, including a cheap cable. Prints great, high quality and clarity. Many moving and clicking parts necessary to print basic text make me wonder how long it will live. One other gripe: The bundled software is mostly marketing gimmicks that give away free information about you on-line when you aren't looking; better to purchase stand-alone software. I've had it 2 weeks and will submit another review after it has been put through its paces. Overall seems far better than a similarly priced color inkjet printer in my office at work."
1,Defective Printer,"After installing the printer software, the printer quickly failed. The printer failed after I printed the second page. I couldn't get the autofeeder to work afterwards.In addition, I was unable to get free technical support after hours. Cannon charges a $25 fee for calling after hours.I returned the printer and purchased another brand. I am quite happy with this choice."
3,Great Black & White printer,"I have not been able to get this printer to recognize DOS programs, ie Mail List, Form Tool, and Pro-write, it also prints green instead of blue. but is otherwise a fast, reliable home printer. It handles all Windows programs well."
4,Funny and entertaining!,"This is only the second Mott-Davidson book I've read, and I love her characters and the author's sense of humor. She is really, really funny. While the plot wasn't brilliant, it was good enough. It kept me turning the pages and guessing who done it until the end. However, the caterer's kid Arch needs an attitude overhaul. What an absolute brat! First Goldy is abused by the jerk, and now she's getting psychological abuse from a 14-year old? PUH-LEASE. Spare me. Goldy should sent Arch to boot camp or have him volunteer in an abused women's shelter so he can get a dose of the real world."
4,Comfortable Read With Recipes Worth Keeping,"When an author has published more than one book, comparisons are bound to be made. This wasn't my favorite but it was, nevertheless, an enjoyable read. The recipes, as always sound wonderful."
2,Bitterness spoils the fun,"Goldy is most fun when she has a fiesty attitude. In this mystery she's too pre-occupied with the Jerk. Memories weight her down. The plot and relationships get bogged down, too. Loose ends (such as the window damage left by her ex) aren't resolved. Not what I'd come to expect."
2,"Pass the salt, please","I have read all of Davidson's books and this one seems a little bland. Although the characters are as lively as ever, this plot seemed too contrived. The jab at HMOs is certainly more subtle than the heavy-handed anti-domestic violence message. Let's get the Jerk out of the storylines. I'm hoping her new book is better. Still, not a bad summer read if you're just looking for a little escapism."
3,Detective/Caterer solves crime with gourmet flair.,"While this book was a fun and fast read, as a caterer I would like to know who does the dishes and shops for all of the last minute things that are always needed. The story was interesting and you keep guessing until the end. I can't wait to try the included recipies!"
4,I haven't had this much fun since I read Nancy Drew !,"Davidson is an easy read. I eagerly await each of her new books. I find it difficult to second- guess her plots. The development of her relationships with the men in her life is a twisted path, but insteresting to read. The Grilling Season won't give you nightmares-- but then you will probably finish it before going to bed."
1,Goldy....GET A LIFE outside of that whiny brat of yours!,"I'm getting pretty tired of whiny, pouty, in-charge-of-it-all Arch....he's becoming quite a chip off the old block....I mean, really, if my ex-husband was beating up on me and breaking into my house, my kids would have a fit! They'd probably kill him...not whine when he landed in jail....I liked the earlier Goldy books and I was happy when she found a great guy to marry, but, the story line with the Jerk and that bratty kid has worn pretty thin.Goldy needs to realize that catering to every one of Arch's whims does him no service....who will care when he gets into the real world and he moves out or pouts for weeks on end.I won't be reading any more Mott Davidson."
3,Great book for a rainy day,"This is my first exposure to Diane Mott Davidson and I enjoyed it. I love to cook, so I plan to try some of the recipes from the book.I agree with the other reviewers in that it is a light, easy read. If you're looking for something with a real deep plot, better pass this one by. On the otherhand, if you are looking for something that doesn't require a lot of concentration and that can easily be read in a week or less, I recommend this book.I will be back for more of Goldy."
3,OK but not her best,"I've come late to this series and I'm trying to read them in order. On the whole I've enjoyed them and the characters, but I think Arch needs an attitude adjustment and Golda needs to get some backbone...I have never been abused so maybe the victim mentality continues forever but Arch seems to be turning into a manipulator who knows all the right buttons to push. This is probably too harsh a criticism for a book that is over all a good read."
1,Enough of the JERK!,It was all I could do to listen to all of this book. As far as I am concerned Ms. Davidson goes over the top in this book in her treatment of the JERK and his rampages. He could show up far less often in this book to far better effect. So intensly mean and abusive is he that I had to turn off the tape and take a break from his tirades. For those who have not read it I will not say weather we see the last of him here. But in more recent books the adolescent Arch seems to take more and more after him. It is for that reason I do not know how much longer I will follow the series if the Jerk hangs around.
4,I enjoyed this,"After trying some ""Susan Henshaw"" and some ""Blackbird Sisters"" mysteries and being disappointed, I found this book. It was ""meatier"" if you'll pardon the pun and I felt that I knew the characters. I will be reading more of Ms. Davidson's books."
5,"Great read, riviting","This book series would make a great television series! I highly recommend both books and audio books for the series of ""Goldie"" mysteries!"
1,a painful read,This book was just painful to read. Im up to date on all my favorites and so I am really trying to enjoy this series because there are so many and I like that. But this book is worse than the previous one. I skipped so many pages and only skimmed the end so I would understand if I decided to read anymore. Its like there are always too many people or just rambling but this series never comes together for me. Goldy always becomes annoying and tom is portrayed as so passive. Arch treats his mom like dirt. This series could be so much better!!
4,The Grilling Season,"Throughly enjoyed it.. I'm reading her books in order of publishing, that way I get a real sense of what the main character is going thru and its FUN!"
2,The Grilling Season audio,"Although I enjoy listening to audiobooks in my car, this abridged version is not nearly as enjoyable as a full length version of the same novel."
3,Desaraej,"This book had both useful and hard to take aspects. The arrogance that came out at times with all sorts of advice about you, ""Should"" or ""Should not"" was pretty offputting, particularly as the author claimed to have counselling and coaching experience. However, a number of interesting aspects and if you are interested in developing your psychic abilities is worth a read."
5,"If you need to learn to communicate, read this book.","So often we make assumptions on why people behave in certain ways, or we don`t confrount people because of the ""expected outcome"". This book goes a long way to explaining how much we have to gain from collective learning. I recomend this book to anyone."
3,Julie and Musical Numbers Terrific,Julie Andrews proved what a fine actress she is portraying the not-so-Poppinsy Gertie Lawrence. Musical numbers are first rate but the movie is much too long. They spend far too much time dealing with her first and second husbands. It probably would have been better to gloss over the first two and concentrate on her third and end the movie with her death following her bigt success in THE KING AND I. Movie is worth having for Julie and the musical numbers but you can fast forward through the whole section with her second husband. Boring!
4,Julie Andrews and Her Songs,"Film is somewhat slow but the production numbers and songs are a definite, PLUS! The CD to this films is a constant delight at any time."
2,A Dog is a Dog,"Weather its a French Poodle or a mangy mutt. Star may be a French Poodle, but its still a dog. I dont understand all the raves for this film. Its easy to see why it tanked in 68 and I dont understand its cult following today. Yes, Julie (miscast), is beautiful, sings well, oodles of production numbers (way too many); the clothes! But where's the story? Star put the final nail in the coffin for road show pictures. A curiousity piece for those wondering what that era was like. But not a good example of it. Lawrence deserved better."
5,"""Star"" with Julie Andrews review","I think this, along with ""Victor. Victoria"" are her best movies - both having shown her amazing versatility and personality. Terrific musical, songs, lots of wonderful dancing and a thoroughly enjoyanble film. It's a real treat."
5,THIS MOVIE RULES JULIE IS AT HER ABSOLUTE BEST!!,"This is one of the greatest movies i have of Julie Andrews I tresure it. She looks glamerous, like a real STAR! the set is great and she shines in it. A lot of people say it wasn't good but they probably had very bad movie taste SEE IT ALL JULIE FANS, SEE IT!!"
3,FAST FORWARD IN HAND...,"On the tails of Streisand's ""Funny Girl"" came Julie Andrews' STAR, the so-calld ""biopic"" musical of English songstress and stage star Gertrude Lawrence. A dismal box-office failure, the story line is just plain boring, but the musical numbers with Andrews at her multi-octave finest holds up well some 35 or so years later. The costumes are glorious, the sets dazzle and the entire film is worth sitting through if only for Andrew's rendition of Lawrence's rousing ""Saga of Jenny"". Zip through the dialogue and go right to the production numbers. You'll be glad you did."
1,"A absolutely stunning bad film, incredibly putrid!!!!","This movie is so bad, that really, it is stunning. It is just god awful. I can't believe that people are giving this good reviews here at Amazon. It is DREADFUL!!!"
1,Julie's One Big Bomb,"Star! was a dismal flop when it was released and with good reason, it is a big, long, expensive bore! It drags, has little excitement, and even the magnificent Julie can't save it. The musical numbers are dull and the story plods along. Casting Julie Andrews as the late great British stage star Gertrude Lawrence, would seem to have been a stroke of brilliance, and perhaps, in a better written and directed production, it might have been wonderful, but it simply is not. the critics crucified the film, saving any praise for Julie's valiant attempt at injecting life into the lugubrious mess. But audiences stayed away. Even Darling Lili, which also flopped, had some fun and is entertaining. A real shame since Andrews and Lawrence should have been a perfect match for a musical bio. Julie would bounce back with films like 10 and Victor/Victoria proving why she is still the magawatt star that she is."
4,Almost perfect,"I once had a 16mm print of THOSE WERE THE HAPPY DAYS which is an edited version. I had bought the DVD as soon as it came out, but am just now doing the review. It is long and that is a draw-back for many. The production numbers are great. Robert Wise is a great director for Julie Andrews and Daniel Massey as Noel Coward is great [you will see a young Raymond Massey as you look at this]. The film ends as Gertrude marries Richard Aldrich. I would have preferred it to go to THE KING AND I with Yule Brenner; that is the time of her death and it would have completed her story. If you did some trimming on production numbers [not LADY IN THE DARK]I think you could have added the last little bit of her life and career and still kept it to just under 3 hours. The lac of completion is whh I give it four, not five stars. If you like Julie or you like musicals GET IT; the cost is less than a movie ticket and popcorn."
4,An almost great DVD - but not quite!,"This film is a joy from start to finish! CLASSY is the perfect word! But the people at Fox could have done a little more to bring the same class to their DVD. Sadly, they forgot to include the Intermission break and Entr'acte Music available on the (for its time) superb LaserDisc release. And considering the improvements in ""clean-up"" possibilities over the last couple of years, Fox could have removed some of the dirt marks and scratches visible here and there. Also, grain and color balance are far from perfect. Apparently Fox decided to transfer the LaserDisc master to DVD without any further touch up jobs. A little depressing, I must confess! And how I miss that music in the middle of the film!Now, how about ""Can-Can"" and ""State Fair"" (1962) on DVD? Mastered from first class prints, of course! And 100% COMPLETE, thanks!"
5,Love this author,"I chose this book as my selection for the book club I'm part of. I love Gay Hendricks because of the information he provides and in the way he delivers this information. Reading his books is like listening to him as he's having a special conversation with just you. Contains lot's of interesting information. Material is to be tried out and felt, rather than just studied and analyzed."
2,Blah,"Didn't like this book at all. It took me a half a dozen tried to convince myself to read past the 1st chapter. I did not find much of anything that I felt was new or insightful in this book. I kept reading since so many people seem to tout the author, but I found the the latter portion of this book to be even worse than the first part. It seemed weak, contrived and like the author was just wrapping it up-writing what he thought people wanted to read. I know many people have found it to be wonderful and I hope it works for them-I just though I'd share another point of view."
2,Blah,My neighbor was very hot on me reading this book. I think I tried 3 different times and I could not get very far into this book.
3,Pedantic comment,"Hi - I'm being pedantic here but wanted to inform people that this Flux of Pink Indians cd compilation has an incorrect track listing on the sleeve.CDDB database (if you try to copy songs onto your iPod and use this online song reference) is also wrong.The last five tracks are: Sick Butchers, Background of Malfunction, Neu Smell, Tube Disaster, and Poem [not Neu Smell, Tube Disaster, Poem:Sick Butchers, and Background of Malfunction].I'm surprised One Little Indian Records could have got this wrong, considering Derek Birkett, the record label founder and brother of Flux's singer Colin, played guitar in the band.Beyond that it's a great listen of a politically astute band at their prime, before they decided to substitute music for noise and lyrics for propaganda (the follow-up album)."
4,"Excellent composer, wrote more than a minuet","Nowadays, the only piece anyone remembers of Luigi Boccherini's vast output is the minuet from one of his string quintets. Boccherini, however, was extremely prolific, and many of his compositions merit more attention than they currently receive. This is especially true of these cello concertos. They combine significant virtuosity with the gracefulness and pleasantness so often associated with the early classical period. Boccherini was often called the ""wife of Haydn,"" but I find his works to be far more interesting and pleasant than those of Haydn, who, quite frankly, bores me. This is a good CD in the limited cello repertoire."
1,I feel Dooped,"The product I received is not at the strength that I have purchased in the past at local retailers. The scent of the contents is different, as well. I doubt I buy this product online from this supplier again."
2,A Little Exhausted,".When 'The Dance of Change' was published in '99, Senge's work was already reaching the end of it's relevancy. A brilliant thinker, he's had difficulty sustaining creative thinking since 'The Fifth Discipline'. Not surprising. With such a brilliant, breakthrough book like his 1990 masterpiece, one tends to get trapped by one's own fame. Thus is born The Fifth Discipline Industry.The Dance of Change contained nothing new in 1999. By 2006 the ideas contained in 'Dance' are so passe for most industry. Many others have built upon Senge's work in far more effective ways and your time is better spent with them. While you can skip 'Dance', 'The Fifth Discipline' still is a must read, especially if you're working on organizational change in education or human services, two industries that remain stubbornly stuck in the 80's.."
3,Not the best of Senge's books.,"I was left with a ""so what else is new"" feeling upon reading this book. A lot of people share a lot of examples of things which have been going on for years. No breakthroughs here."
2,No structures found anymore in this kind of book...,"Fragmentations, and looking for a framework(biological?), for a model or better maps and healthier organizations is the main theme of the Dance of Change in which we find clearly the holistic worldview as a real outcome of the Fifth Discipline. Yes, maps that can be changed every time they are wrong, no matter the consequences we obtain by the application of that ""mental model"" that didn't work. So we don't find any structures anymore in this kind of field book, as it were, books of the doing. But real change and transformations can be done just from the individual(the part), and as so when it is the instrument of a map not yet known, it is obvious we will find ourselves with a malaise of the organization everybody acknowledges but nobody wants to talk about. Holism always instrumentalizing everything as Ken Wilber would say."
3,Retread,"Senge et al have done some wonderful work through time. But like many guru's they begin to sing the chorus of the song again and again with each new title. There are useful things to be found here but if you are looking to stretch your thinking beyond his early works you need to look elsewhere. However, if you are building a library of sound work in the area of change, organizational development and other assorted things then this will prove to be a useful resource. I discounted it simply because I was hoping to find a fresh breeze within."
5,The potato gun that works great.,This toy was an awsome toy. I am glad I asked my mom to order this for me because once I tried it out it shot far away. I think kids around the world should order or buy this gun because it is really cool.
2,Very poor quality,They were flimsy plastic. The first one broke within minutes of use. The other two either couldn't keep the potato in the gun or they jammed. After about 20 minutes the children put them away. They weren't fun to play with. I definitely would not recommend these guns to anyone. Find a gun that's a little more substantial.
1,THESE DONT WORK!!!!! TRY A DIFFERENT VENDOR!,"I have purchased these potato guns/spud shooters for children before from other vendors and the kids had lots of fun with them. I took them apart and cleaned them, unplugged them when they stopped functioning, etc and so am quite familiar with how they work, so believe me when I tell you, these are simply defective toys. I purchased four of these guns and all four did not have enough compression to fire the potato pellet. I tried cleaning them, lubricating them, nothing helped. DONT BUY THIS ITEM! THEY DO NOT WORK! TRY A DIFFERENT VENDOR!"
3,works,"low price, ok product. Works as described, son used it for a few days. Better than a dollar store toy, good for little kids."
1,Potato Gun = Waste of Money,The potato gun is a waste of money. Keep your 5 bucks and buy a friend a coca cola with the money. Just awful!!!
2,A dud. It was the gun that never fired.,"It is a very interesting idea to have a potato as your bullet, sounds like a lot of fun. It claims to get 300 shots out of a single piece of potato. The only thing I can see trouble is the hundreds of pellets that would be lying around the house, on the couch, under the furniture, behind the TV, etc. But anyway, the most awaited test for the gun turned out to be a failure. The gun was a complete dud. It was the gun that never fired.The construction is cheap...which I have expected. But what I also have expected is that at least it will work, it never did. It is made of 2 pieces of plastics with a spring and a plunger. I am a bit frustrated right now, with a whole punctured potato on my hand, and a worthless potato gun. Makes me wonder how many out of ten potato guns work?"
1,Junk waste of money,"By boys had guns like these a few years ago, and they worked just fine - really enjoyed them! They are now 11 & 12, and while we were at our local record shop they found these upstairs in the gift section. They were so excited because they remembered how mush fun they were. I was fine with the purchase too - because they were cheap, and not so violent as today's video games. We drove home and the first thing they did was shove the gun tip into a tater - NOTHING! Not even a poof. The potato pellet made no attempt to come out. Like I said, We've had these in the past. I'm not sure what eventually happened to them. I can't remember - they're obviously not going to last forever. But these exact one's you're considering here.. I'd pass - unless you like disappointing kids and wasting your money."
1,It was broken,I ordered this for my son and his friend as a gag gift for Christmas. I got two of them and one worked and the other was broken. The spring was cracked. Must have been damaged through the mail not sure.. The one gun that did work was ok but lost interest in it after 30 minutes. I also ordered them the Marshmellow shooter and they both worked and LOVED THEM!!
2,UNINSPIRED ACTION FILM,"AN UNDERGROUND VIGILANTE GROUP [LEAD BY WILLIAM FORSYTHE] ATTEMPTS TO BRING DOWN A KIDNAPPING RING [LEAD BY ANDREW DIVOFF] WHICH IS ALSO BEING INFILTRATED BY A WOMAN [ERIKA ELENIAK] WHO'S SEEKING INFORMATION ON HER MISSING SISTER. THE FILM IS BOUGHT DOWN BY MEDIOCRE ACTING AND AN UNEVEN PLOT. EVEN BURT REYNOLDS [WHO'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTORS] FAILS TO HELP THIS FILM. THERE'S PLENTY OF ACTION FOR SURE, JUST DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING ELSE WITH IT."
2,"Strictly a ""B"" grade Movie","Some..very minimal A list actors in a B movie. There was lots of action in this film, too much in fact. It took some time for the actual storyline to take effect really!! Audio on this DVD is terrible to say the least!! Spots are very low and are hard to hear...too many than I would like to count in fact!! What is good about this movie...Burt Reynolds is in it...that is about it...he must have really needed the pitance that this film gave him!! Do not waste your time on this one, unless you like really poor storylines and acting to boot!!"
1,Worst seller ever!!!,Late in delivery. The item was ordered on the 15th December 2008 and the delivery was 26th December 2008. It took 11days for an item within the USA. why? Item was meant for xmas gift but defeated my aim!
4,Perfect chair for the archer who hunts from a ground blind,"I've searched forever to find a chair that is comfortable and small to use during archery season. This chair is it! I've hunted on buckets, lawn chairs and even without chairs. This chair is lightweight, small and has a backrest. If you need a chair for a ground blind, don't hesitate to get this one."
1,Color-blind graphic artist,"The point of an atlas is the maps, and in this case the maps are horrible. Jagged lines indicate the edge of continents, thick dotted lines (bright red) indicate language boundaries, and the languages themselves are in a headache-inducing color palate -- aquamarine next to pink next to purple. There is no way that any competent graphic artist would turn out such a project, unless he/she had a grudge against the company and wanted to get revenge by producing the worst maps possible. But didn't any editor notice?If I had seen the maps before I bought this book, I wouldn't have."
5,I loved this book,This is the first book by Iris Johansen I read and my goodness what a page turner. I just kept reading till I was finished into the wee hours of the morn.I loved the characters of Nell and Nicholas and the other characters were also amazing.I will most assuredly be buying another book by this author.
4,Great but not the best Johansen book,"This is was the first IJ book I've read, and I have honestly read pretty much all her books since this one. Ducking is really great, but the characters could be developed more, there was so much written about Nells ""transformation"" but I would have like more dialouge between Nell and Tanek. I would love to read a sequel of this book because I really liked the characters both are strong, but vulernable. The side characters, although well written, took on too much of an importance in this story.After reading Dead Aim, Face of Deception, Killing Game, Long after midnight, its obvious that this is not IJs best book but a great read. You won't be disapointed, you'll just want to read more about these characters."
5,one of my fav's by her,Truley grand loved every page . beauty is on the inside. there was courage real love a real trooper never giving up and everyone got what they deserve only part that was unfair was the daughter but life isnt fair and things like this happen and worse.
3,Nice Story,"Nice story. At first I had a difficult time getting wrapped up in the story. The characters were difficult to pinpoint until the story fleshed out a bit. By the end of the novel, I felt it was an enjoyable read. I liked the love story and the chase, but overall it was an okay weekend read."
2,"Very confusing and complex, and hard to connect with characters","I liked the premise and characters of Johansen'sFirestorm (Eve Duncan)better, but she took more time with relationship and character development in this one, which was good. Just felt more of a connection WITH the characters inFirestorm (Eve Duncan), but more of a connection BETWEEN the characters with this one. However, it was pretty confusing and complex at parts, and the ending was just too abrupt. I actually think I likedFirestorm (Eve Duncan)better, so try that one first."
2,Unbeliveable,"I guess if it takes only a fall from a balcony to become beautiful I'm going to get in line. Come on, this was one of the stupidest storylines I've ever read. I really enjoyed Long After Midnight, but was definetly disappointed with this book."
2,Hated It!,"I've read several of Iris' novels and this is by far my least favorite. The title was very misleading to me. I felt the plot was unrealistic and slow going. After I finished the book, I came away with a feeling of dissatisfaction. There was not much about this book that I could praise! I would skip it."
2,The Ugly Duckling,"Sadly, the more likeable characters of this novel are not the main characters. Oh, the main characters are not horrible, but they're boring in comparison to their friends. I picked this up recognizing Iris Johanson as a romance writer and this isn't really a romance. I was very disappointed that the hero NEVER tells the heroine that he loves her. That he slept with another woman after developing feelings for her didn't help either. The majority of the time Nell was thoroughly unpleasant to be around. The author killed off two characters after letting the reader form an attachment to them. I recommend checking this one out from the library before committing to a purchase."
1,forget it,"What a waste of time. The story was contrived, unconvincing and not at all compelling. This was the first book by this author I have read. Maybe I expected something different"
1,a basic YING-YANG book only good for female readers,"So skin-deeply, so superfluously written by a supposed to be talented female author. But as most books written by women(except Taylor Caldwell), this book is in the territory of a female writer,who thought the plots were already too frightening to be put off, yet to the male readers, it's like 'CRY WOLF' fairy tale. Give me a break, please write romance, do not mix up or try to overlap other territories that might be totally ridiculed by you gentle kind. Thanks, but no cigar"
3,Reasonable,"I expected more from this book, but it was still decent. It's not a book that you can't put down, put it still holds interest. The beginning and end are very good, but the middle gets somewhat slow and can lose some interest. Overall, this book has a good story, it just isn't packed with action the whole time, which I prefer."
3,Slow,Slow to start...picks up then just gets ridiculous . Ends with heroine leaving...epilogue finishes with her coming back. Good story line.
5,Fantastic,"My first Iris Johansen book, after that I got addicted to all her thrillers. This one is a real page-turner and I could hardly sleep till I finished the whole book."
4,The Ugly Duckling,"THE UGLY DUCKLING. A great read and a page turner. Interesting characters that are on a mission seeking revenge on the one who killed her daughter. Hard to put down and a typical Iris Johansen thriller. If you are in to johansen,be sure to read this one."
2,Exciting Story but Unrealistic Characters,"I started out liking this book, but by the time I got half-way through the characters were too unbelievable to continue. I finally threw the book away from frustration."
5,One of my All-Time Favorites,"This was the first book I'd ever read by Iris Johansen (about 4 years ago), and I LOVED IT!!! After reading it, I went straight to the library and checked out every other book she'd ever written (even the romance novels-- not my usual genre.) Since then, I've come to recognize a lot of similarities in her books. In many cases, it seems like she re-uses the same characters, just giving them different names in each book. But I still read them all. And ""The Ugly Duckling"" is still my favorite."
5,IJ At her BEST!!!,"Once again Ij has captivated me with a old, but new, and refreshing story. I listened to the audio cassettes and was captivated from start to finish. I highly recommend this one for all of you who want an adventure that will keep you up all night."
3,I got through it...,The title was kind of misleading. There was this whole great set-up in the things a woman has to go through according to how she looks... but she never really followed through with how a woman's perpective changes according to how the world treats her when she's 'ugly' as opposed to 'model looking'. The mystery was ok. Kept me guessing well enough - but when I closed the book I didn't feel as if our hero and heroine knew each other well enough to fall in love.
4,A very good thriller,"I believe that The Ugly Duckling is a very good book, although I was a little bit confused about what type of book it was, because for a minute it seemed like a horror then a mystery and finally it seemed like a romance novel. I truly enjoyed the book. I had to read it in order to do my Novel Analysis for English and I must truly admit that Iris Johansen is a very outspoken and intellectual individual. I give her two thumbs up. She is such a great author that everyone was trying to urchase one of her books, but we couldn't because we were not allowed to all have the same book. By reading this book it has convinced me to read other books by Iris johansen. It only took me two and a half days to read this book,but forever to do the assignment because I kept going back reading the book over and over again. I wish Iris Johansen the best of luck in her remaining future with her writing"
5,Great,This book along with Face of Deception is what hooked me to her books. Most of them are wonderful but there are a couple that turn out predictable.
4,Feasts of Jehovah,"In this practical, yet deeply enriching study of the Old Testament feasts, we see types of present grace and coming glory."
5,"Review of the content and characters in ""Night Shift""","A very well done compiliation of short stories. King is very good with characterization and mood. I like the character Winsconsky in Graveyard shift,quite comical. My favourite stories in this book are: ""Graveyard Shift"",""Jerusalems Lot"",""Quitters Inc."",""The Man who loved flowers"".and ""The Ledge"".All of them are good,but there are some very weird ones as well. Over all,a very good read,on par with ""Nightmares and Dreamscapes""."
4,"Almost perfect, but....","Ok, I admit it. I'm probably a bit older than the target audience here. But while some plot twists get un-kinked, others get so badly skewed it's... well, almost hard to believe. Mostly as good as the rest, but the whole ella thing just hurt my suspension of disbelief. Maybe she wasn't pure evil, but please... Does anyone else think it was a written for TV series? Especially with the whole recent rash of super-girl shows..."
4,GREAT BOOK,"Pascal is a gifted storyteller mixing suspense, mystery, intrigue, and romance into her narrative. I found the plot fast-paced and immensely readable. The series just gets better and better! Fans of VC Andrews & Sherry A. Mauro will enjoy these books, too!"
5,Well worth the wait,"Well, Fearless fans, we've been waiting for this one for a while and it certainly doesn't let us down! I woun't give away anything, because it's the conclusion to FEARLESS, but I'll tell you this. It's fantastic! Gaia is amazing and Killer hit a home-run in my opinion. Dont mis this stunning finish to Fearless, the best young adult series out!"
2,Zero Stars,"This book contains grahic violence (lots of curse words too). ""But then she saw the blood, it had poured into a thick black pool around her head, sacrafice almost like a halo. It was more blood than..."" This is sick. Young adults don't need to read this. What kind of ideas do they get from this? Reviewed by the mother of a 13-yr old."
5,Killer Book,Killer was the best book in the whole Fearless series so far. It has a lot of twist and turns. In this book you see the real Ella who appears totally different. Gaia believes that her father is Loki and that it was her father who killed her mother. The best part of the book was that Gaia and Sam finally tell each other how they feel. This was a killer book and I would reccomend it to anyone because it has everything from action to romance.
5,"This is a fantastic, hilarious, well-written book.","Dan Zevin is at least on a par with pulitzer prize-winning humorist Dave Barry. This book is a must-read for anyone who plans on getting married, and even for those who don't. His book ""Entry Level Life: A Complete Guide To Masquerading As A Member Of The Real World"" is just as funny and should be a part of everyone's collection as well."
3,Guys right for guys read,"The book is about lots of cool short stories about guys. There are stories about guys dealing with girls, sports, fighting, fishing, anything you name it. My favorite part of the book is when a boy needs a jersey for the football team he wants to be on, there are only 8 players on the whole team and there are basically 2 guys that run the whole team. He asks his mom to make him a bright green jersey just like the guys and she makes one that took her the whole day and it is pea green like puke. He yells at his mom and tells her it is crap and he hates it then she hit him and it made her cry. He ended up going to the game and all the guys made fun of him and he stuck it out and had a good game. I would recommend this book even though I did not give it a better rating. The book was a little bit cool. It wasn't the best because like half the stories were stupid and weren't funny. The crowd I would recommend this book to would be guys obviously and guys with a sense of humor."
4,A Really Good Book,"I really enjoyed the book. I thought that it was a funny, wonderful collection of vingettes from different authoprs perspective. The thing that I liked the most was the fact that they where all written about the authors lives, things that actually happened to them. I also enjoyed the humor and truth to the stories. Most of the things they had wrote about had either happened to me, or seemed like they could really take place. All in all I really liked the book, and I can't wait until I stumble upon something simmiler."
3,Question instead of review,"Is there anything in the book that would be deemed inappropriate for young, very conservative, readers? It sounds like a wonderful choice, but need to know how the material is presented. Thanks!"
4,The Next Chapter of a new Comic Masterpiece.,"The next addition to the world of steampunk takes you deeper into the brilliant mayhem of Joe Kelly and Chris Bachalo's dark fantasy legend. With conflicted hereos, deadly enemies, and a doomed love, Drama Obscura brings you further into the twisted realm of Steampunk. A must for fans and those not yet exposed to this terriffic series."
3,Abstruse and Complex,"An intriguing world of Victorian England gone mad with steam-punk and animal-man hybrids. The characters are all very original, the illustrations detailed, crowded and sometimes very confusing. The plot is a little hard to understand as is the sequence of the panels. All in all this requires a tedious amount of work to keep up with, but if the premise and atmosphere do it for you, I would say it is worth the read. I enjoyed the first title and am on my way to beginning the second. I wish they had spaced things out a bit more, given some of the panels more breathing room, some of the characters more time to develop but the writers enjoy throwing us in to the melting pot, so to speak, and letting us figure things out on our own."
2,Perhaps my expectations were to high?,"I purchased expecting something of a reasonable weight...I was wrong. What I got was VERY thin and felt cheap. The lettering on mine was hardly readable because the background was tarnished (that I fixed with a polishing cloth). Perhaps for the price I had higher epectations than I should have, but I was just not impressed."
4,A very good introduction to Chinese history,"This book is clearly written and covers competently a broad range of topics. The author follows a topical format (as opposed to a strictly chronological) and discusses in turn general political history, social and political structures, intellectual life, arts and literature. All are described fairly well, though the coverage of some personalities is sketchy perhaps because of space limitations. But the author is clearly very knowledge and provides an adequate amount of critical analysis (in addition to the merely descriptive) so that one doesn't lose sight of the bigger picture."
5,Must reading on CHina,"China - Forget all the noise you can get stuck with from Foreign Affairs and the rest of the present Harvard Brain-trust. Read this book. It's old, it coincentrates on the long past as CHina developed into the modern ages. It gives you the background so that when you read news about China or watch CCTV you get the sub-story, the stuff that is always between the lines. China's back. This book explains what you are dealing with today."
5,Ultimate collection,"This collection of photographs spanning almost the entirety of U2's career is nothing short of amazing. It's worth the money just having alternate ""Joshua Tree"" cover shots, photos taken during the recording of ""JT,"" and the more intimate portraits of Bono and his family. Favorite shot: Bono posing with a donkey. Very Christ-like."
3,U2 is the greatest,"Should have read all comments before I ordered my copy at over $80. It is hard to read because it is all handwritten. Not enough different pictures of the band were included. Yes it provides a time line, but the pictures are limited in scope. Was disappointed. I love U2 and have attended many concerts over the years and have collected many items relating to U2."
4,Great little book,"I wanted this book when it was first released, but the original price was a little much. Picked it up recently and now know why it is considerably cheaper. It is much smaller than the original release. Even though it is smaller in size, the pictures are just as unforgettable. Great little book."
5,U2&I,"If you are an U2 fan, then I recommend you to buy this book. I decided to give it as a present and this has been the right idea.This book is a great insight into their the world. The images and writings are marvellous!! Thank you."
3,Hard To Read,"I just got this book. I am disapponted that I spent so much. ALL of the captions in the book are actually, or made to look like, the authors messy handwriting. It is SO, SO hard to read. The opening interview is typwritten, but with many pictures of the author that I could have done without.:("
5,I have all his albums on vinyl,Richard Harris was a phenomenal talent. I saw him live in the early 70's in Boston and it was an amazing evening. This CD has most of his best and is very well worth the price. It's a shame that not many who knew him as an actor were aware of his music and an added shame that all his work is not available on CD.
1,Tone Deaf and needs a respirator,"MacArthur Park by Richard Harris should only be sold on April Fool's Day. Calling Richard Harris a singer is like calling PeeWee Herman an Olympic body builder. Besides proving he is tone deaf and consistently off key, he sounds like he should be on a respirator. I have never heard such a weak singer on a commercial album. I have to believe that Harris produced the album himself because no one in their right mind would have produced this CD had they listened to it first. What a total waste of a good orchestral performance."
5,My Favorite Version,"...of course it's not everyone's cup of tea. That's why there's so many choices out there. Incidently Jonathan W. Williams' review offered a pound sterling to anyone who figured out the lyrics. I'm not saying that I have the difinitive answer, but I'm told that MacArthur Park is, or at least was, the Bowery of San Francisco, a place where people, who were once full of promise, go to drink it all away, and watch their formerly structured lives ""melt"" in the rain, no matter how long it took to ""bake"" it."
3,Correction: NOT missing songs!,"The two songs cited as missing by one reviewer, ""When It Was Done"", and ""If I'd Been Born a Different Man"" ARE on this CD. They are sections of ""Hymns for Grand Terrace,"" which is included here in its 9+ minute entirety. You get two complete albums, *A Tramp Shining* and *The Yard Went on Forever* for a great price."
3,What A Yawner!!!!,Janet has really captured the essence of the dysfunctional family life that today's youth endure. Of course we know that she has experienced so much of this in her own life with young Brad. And this is why she has been able to deliver one of the finest pieces of written work on this subject. At this very time I read it to my own family just before bed. It has an amazing ability to put the whole family to sleep in just a matter of minutes. I sincerely would like to thank you for such a fine contribution to today's families. If only the book had been written sooner so many young juvenile delinquents could have been saved. God bless
3,Dan from Kansas,"I recieved this scaffolding with a broken brake on one wheel. I have tried to email the company who sent this item and have recieved no response. The scaffolding is very good quality and assembled easly. It is easy to adjust and except for the broken brake I would give it a very good rating. I feel a company should stand behind their product and replace broken parts. I am still waiting to hear from this one. Shipping is very high because of the weight of this product, just slightly less that the cost of the product."
5,EJs Rolling & Bracing DVD,Great instructional video for anyone just getting started or wants to tune-up their rolling skills. Eric Jackson puts it in a very easy to understand format for anyone to learn!
4,Good recording of little-heard music ...,"Very nice performances, with clean crisp articulation and generally good sound. My only quibble is with the tempo of the Andrea Gabrieli Magnificat -- it seems a bit too brisk to me, given the space in which it would have been performed and the likely distance between the three choirs in San Marco, an effect which I believe Gloriae Dei Cantores is trying to replicate. There were times when the sound became ""muddy,"" and a slower tempo would have mitigated that effect. Some might also argue with doubling the TTBB choir with low brass instruments (with no other doubling in the piece), but that's really a matter of personal taste. Gabrieli would have used whatever he had on hand, so if all he had were sackbuts, sackbuts he would have used.This is a good investment if you're looking for music performed in one of Venice's -- and the world's -- finest cathedrals."
4,Very illuminating,"""Thinkers"" is not written in a western culture format. To its credit, it is not written by a western academic. Western readers, please get past the presentation to absorb the content.""Thinkers"" is both illuminating, and distrubing. It brings understanding to difficult social & political interaction with Muslims, which can never be resolved. It exposes the deep hold & fear put on Muslim believers to continue in the faith.""Thinkers"" has added resolve to my desire of reading Koran cover to cover. Islam is a life focus, identity & fiber of being not understood by the west. To go beyond media hype & western opinion, I want to know & understand the what, how & why of the Muslin faith.""Thinkers"" is an important Beginners read on the foundations of Islamic beliefs."
3,This doesn't work on SmartBoards!,"Yes yes .. it SHOULD work on a SmartBoard ... but save your time, money and frustration; these aren't the droids you're looking for. They may indeed work just fine as advertised - but if you're looking to replace the EXPENSIVE SmartBoard version of these devices - these don't work."
4,Does what it says,"Good intentions for what it does. Works the way its suppose to. Great way to lengthen the distance for USB devices. Had some issues with using it on a usb cable modem, kept loosing and getting the connection. pverall a great idea and great product to have."
2,Be Careful 12mbps Limit!,"Irritating to find that there was an asterisk on the box that says""*Limited to 12Mbps""Try running a modern web cam like that, especially a Logitech. It fails miserably... this didn't work as advertised, and unfortunately, I have to ship 7 of these back.."
2,Extends USB but not as advertised.,I purchased this hoping I had found a cheap solution for extending my xbox kinect sensor from a out-of-sight closet to my TV. It is limited to 12 MBps which is slower then the kinect needed. The xbox does see that the kinect is connected but says that the connection is to slow.
1,Doesn't work with PS3 peripherals,"I bought this to run out of my PS3 (in my AV closet) to go to the area on the other side of a large media room where we have a driving wheel and a Playseat set up for Gran Turismo. I havent run the cabling up in the ceiling yet, but I attached it to a 50' CAT5e patch cord, and while it communicated with the wheel for a second, it doesn't work properly. Not sure what to do now. I need about a 45' carry. Guessing a USB cable this long wouldn't work either..."
5,Too bad they are discontinued,I have had very good luck with these. I use them to extend SMART and Promethean boards as well as webcams and other peripherals.
5,Super cute puppet!,My daughter loved this puppet to use in her preschool class! It fit her hand well and was very cute/
5,Awesome!!,"As a teacher of 2 year olds, I can strongly recommend this book! This was by far their favorite book. They started reciting the ""Clickety, Clack"" line, and soon had the entire book memorized. My own 2 year old would recite the book at the grocery store. It is so catchy and a lot of fun!"
5,Mesmerizing rhythm,"The pictures are darling, but it's the rhythm of the words that pulls you in. By the end of the book, you can whisper the clickety clacks and it sounds like train wheels.Very engaging book. I like it, the big brother likes it, and the little brother goes crazy for it. They recite it in the car. We also play around with the book to find other short-vowel ""a"" words in the pictures -- hat, platform, cat, bag, giraffe, trash can (all on the cover).The illustrations are terrific. They are very clear and full of humor."
4,CullensAbcs.com Review of Clickety Clack,"Length:: 0:43 MinsCullen [....] reviews this book and gives you ideas on how to use to use it interactively with your child. For you I have more video book reviews, free children videos and free activity idea videos at [...].

1,Beware,"I purchased the Canon BJC-50 in August of 1998. It has taken at least three hours to three days of effort to get it to work for each time that I have occasionally used it. I have used it mainly for color printing, and also for scanning with the optional scanning cartridge. It is particularly troublesome when switching from scan to print functions. It is quite noisy. I can not depend on it to function when I need it. It usually works eventually, but only after many trial and error attempts. Email technical support usually does not provide a quick solution. There have been no quick solutions. There have only been time consuming, painstaking encounters with this machine."
4,Great Harmonies and songs i've never heard,"The Association had some of the best group harmonies for having a band which WASN'T a bunch of family members. I particulary enjoy this album because it has songs which really weren't hits. This isn't to say the album is poor though because of it, in fact...far from it. The vocals on this album are perhaps the tightest i've heard out of the band and in general, the music is strong.This shouldn't be your starting point for the Association however, there are too many other great albums in which i'd take ahead of this one, especially Insight Out and Birthday and Along Comes the Association. It is 100% worth owning though, so if you've got those other albums, i'd go ahead and grab yourself a copy!"
4,"At last! ""Broccoli"" on CD.","I will never understand why ""Yes I Will"" wasn't a huge hit. Great song, right?"
5,Just what I was looking for,I needed Diaper Pins to put on my son's backpack (his school requires it for sending home important notices). These were great because I could pick out the color I wanted and they shipped right away. I had them within just a few days of ordering. Very happy with them.
1,CHEATED.....,I order pink and purple pins for a game at my BFF's Baby Shower a few weeks ago and I was cheated on how many I ordered.The company left out 11 total........... I could not tell at first because they put them all in one bag. When I opened them and counted...... I was short my order.NOT happy at all.
1,Backwards,Pins open on the wrong side making them difficult to open properly. Don't recommend this item.
5,Love the color.,"Who would have thought that Diaper Safety Pins would be so difficult to find. I was really glad to get these and the color is great. The pink is more of a coral-ish pink. I like that they come in bulk without all the extra packaging. Good price, too."
5,Another great gift!,I gave this to another daughter-in-law and she was so thrilled that she watched that night. And the best thing is that she didn't have sit through commercials.
5,Love the show,We're fans of the shows but without cable TV we haven't been able to see all the episodes. First season was really good. Only downside was the price dropped once I bought & then I found the 1st-5th season for $6.99 each on Christmas Special at a local grocery store. :( Too late -wasn't returning it since it was already wrapped up for a gift for Christmas. O'well.
4,The Big Bang Theory 2nd Season,I bought this for my husband. We both enjoy the program and I am working on completing the collection to catch the ones we missed.
4,Great show,"The second season of Big Bang was still the funniest comedy ever. The writing slipped just a tiny bit, but the dialogue is so intense,it's easy to forgive. A wonderful third season put them right back into perfection. I hope they don't make the mistake of getting more and more raunchy as some other shows have done...""How I Met Your Mother"" is a perfect example. This show doesn't need it..keep it on a cerebral level, please. It's perfect as it is."
5,A Nerd's Paradise of a Sitcom,"This series, about four ubernerds and a good-looking gal, is consistently inventive, unexpected, and hilarious. The first season was wonderful and I was concerned that the extremity could not be continued for a second season, but I was definitely wrong. It continues to be one of my favorite sitcoms, right up there with The IT Crowd (check that one out as well)."
5,"kiss-kiss, bang bang","Since I already own Complete First Season, I knew that the Complete Second Season was a must-have addition to the ""collection""--- I own a few ""Sheldonshirts""--- these guys make me laugh like I'm thirteen--- the writing is spectacular, and as they say in the business...character driven, and the plots are good to all the characters; yes, Parsons is a break-out actor--- what a victory for the Asperger's community..."
5,Great Show,I really like this show. Its one of the funniest show on tv right now. I wold recommended to anyone who needs a laugh.
5,big bang theory sheldon rules,the Big Bang Theory is absolutely fabulous. The casts chemisty is really tight and while all the characters are fantastic Sheldon is the best. A must watch-I can't wait til the 3rd season hits dvd!
5,2nd Season,"Having never seen an episode of Big bang Theory, I got hooked on it during a bout with the flu. These characters are so real. Being a nerd, I feel welcome. Of course, I'm sure Sheldon would have something in his roommate agreement contract to kick me out."
2,One of the Best TV Shows On The Air,"I bought this because I had a few of the season 2 episodes but not all. So the DVD casing has come apart, which means that I can't properly close the DVD case. Something I'm frustrated about, and am not willing to spend an outrageous amount to have fixed, its to small of an issue to be fixed. This is something minor, but I keep good care of my DVD's so the fact that how they were handled in the mail means that they are broken in minor areas which is something I couldn't control is something I don't like. I like things to look asethically pleasing so the fact that the plastic casing has come apart, and that the closure of the DVD is broken so it doesn't automatically closes erks me. Lesson learned."
2,Two stars thanks to the obnoxious laugh track,"I like this show, I think it's funny. I know I'm gonna be crucified for saying this, but here we go: The two-stars rating is due to one of the most obnoxious, unreleting, unforgiving laugh track I ever saw in a sitcom. It's simple unbearable, it borders on aggressive. The guy says ""Hello"", and there comes the laugh track, loud and and right through your head, like a hammer. Heck, the show is funny, I don't know why the producers think they should use the laugh track this way. I repeat: it's one of the worst laugh tracks ever in a sitcom."
1,Missing Disc,"Be careful!I love this show, but I was sad when I realized that Disc 4 was missing. I couldn't believe it, considering It was a brand new and sold by amazon. So keep that in mind before you bought it!PS: If you know how to get the missing disc I would really appreciate it."
4,Can't miss Episode,"This episode was alot of fun. You'll enjoy it more if you've seen a few other episodes so you understand the characters better. I don't want to do spoilers, but there's a part with Penny and Howard that is Hilarious!! Go ahead and buy the whole season - it'll save you some money and you know you'll want to see them!"
5,Most entertaining thing on TV right now,Love this show. Season 2 has more plots about the geeky foursome and their gal pal across the hall. The writing and the acting both come together in this series. Even my Mom likes this series and I'm sure she doesn't get a lot of the jokes. The gag real is a real bonus!
5,I love it,I love this show. It is awesome. This box set is exactly as expected. Would recommend this show to anyone.
4,Great sophomore Year,This arrived in time and in perfect condition. This season was great. Very funny. This is the year most of the recurring inside jokes started. It was great to go back and see how they started.
3,Best Show Ever!,Best show ever!I only gave it 3 stars because disc 2 is not working. The sound comes on but no picture. Very disappointing for a new disc.
4,very funny,I love this show. I have the 1st and 2nd season. My husband and I sit down to watch it a laugh a lot. I just wish it had less sexual humor. will be getting the 3rd seaon when it comes out.
5,LOVE THIS SERIES!,THIS IS FRESH AND NEW AND POSITIVE AND I LOVE IT! HAPPY TO HAVE THHE FIRST TWO SERIES IN MY COLLECTION AND WILL GET THE REST WHEN RELEASED!
5,Es magnífica!,"Adoro esta serie, y me parece sensacional la cantidad de citas a tantas otras series y films que he visto."
5,Big Bang Theory Season 2,"The Big Bang Theory season 2 is really funny and entertaining, I love this show more and more as it goes along. It is a great tv series to own and it is one that you can watch over and over again. I would recomend this show for anyone who likes The Big Bang Theory season 1 or for anyone who just wants a god laugh."
5,Big Bang,Love this tv show. Can not wait to add more seasons to complete my collection. Received it in wonderful condition.
2,European DVDs dont work in American dvd players,you should war the consumer if your importing a foreign version that may not work where it's being shipped to
5,OMG Hilarious,I can't count the number of times I've watched this already and it still makes me laugh. Definitely worth the money.
5,Laugh-out-loud FUNNY!,"This is by far the best/most underrated sitcom/show on T.V. Very smart! Laugh-out-loud funny! Unlike most ""sit-com's"", you are guaranteed to ""laugh-out-loud"" a few times during each and every episode. Terrific ensemble cast and tremendous writing. Their should definitely be numerous award nominations and hopefully wins for acting, writing, ensemble cast, etc. A treat!"
5,Banging,"This is probably the best comedy series on tv - EVER! It makes me smirk, laugh out loud and even (bless my husband) snort into his dinner!It is witty, sarcastic and charming in equal measure. The characters are loveable and you get invovled in their lives very quickly. Their complete lack of social understanding is great to watch (particularly Sheldon).I look forward to the show being on every week and think series 3 is the best yet - Leonard's mother is brilliant and the friends link between Penny and the lads develops nicely.Hope there are many more to come!"
3,"The show is awesome, DVDs could use more extras","While Big Bang Theory is easily one of the funniest , this review looks to point out a few things about the DVD set.A show like this would have lots more to offer by way of DVD extras and I think the previous set was sorely lacking.Commentaries are fine but there could be more.Bloopers and gag reels for one. More interviews, maybe even some with their physics experts (which we know the show employs). Pop culture reference trivia. And plenty more.For a show that mines the geek culture with such brilliance, the DVD set is found wanting. Quite the irony. I will still buy this because I love the show, but I wish the DVD producers would step up.And congratulations to Jim Parsons for the Emmy nomination. VERY well deserved."
5,The best sitcom on air now,"The Big Bang Theory is one of those rare and unique TV shows that come once every ten years.Unique, original, well done, well written and best of all: well executed with incredible funny characters and actors.I was hooked since episode one, but the interesting thing is that every friend I have recommended the series and/or loaned the DVDs has been hooked too inmediantly.I have yet to meet someone who has seen the show and tell me that it doesn't like it, that's how great it is.So, if you are planning to buy it, go ahead, you'll not regret it.I just hope the writers know how to keep it fresh and great for seasons to come and that CBS gives the show the credit it deserves (I just feel they don't quite ""get it"" how exceptional this show is)."
5,Awesome should have won tons of emmy's,"I love this show and I am a Universtity Grad with a BS in Business Administration, not science. Of course I did well in high school science so I sort of get where they are going but for the most part this is about lovable social outcasts of high intelligence & all the star trek, comics, social phobias that go along with it. I do of course enjoy star trek, sci fi and read enough comics to be able to identify what the T-shirts represent (though I am more of a Marvel fan and they seem to favor DC).Monday nights of Big Bang and How I Met your Monther on this channel is just perfect."
2,Came early but missing 4th disk..,the package came early however it was missing the 4th dvd to the set! I would recomend opening the package ight away and seeing if all of the product is in the package!
5,FUNNY!! SMART!! REWATCHABLE!!,"The Big Bang Theory Season 2 is extremely funny! I purchased this with season 1 and laughed my head off. My girlfriend isn't much into shows of this type, but after talking her into watching one episode. She was hooked on The Big Bang Theory. The comedy is easy to relate too even though much of it involves topics over my head. They seem to deliver punch lines in a way that it's funny time and time again. I enjoyed every episode and I'm sure most people will also."
5,Love the Geeks,I love this episode of the Big Bang and wanted to see how it would look on my kindlefire. I'm very please with the results. To download took only minutes and the picture quality is excellent.
5,Worth the investment!,"The Big Bang Theory is the only intelligent yet funny series currently running. The characters, plot, and zany situations will pull you back into watching it time and time again. The science in it is also edgy yet implemented in clever and humorous ways. Get the 1st and 2nd seasons and watch them chronologically... without commercial interuption!"
5,"Good price, fast shipping.",I purchased Big Bang Theory for my mom for Christmas this year because I couldn't find it anywhere in stores! It was a really decent price and the shipping was really quick.
3,Great Set but came with cracked disc.,It is the funniest show ever! I love it. Just came to me with one of the discs cracked and unable to watch.
5,Great gift for any fan of this show,"This is exactly what the wife wanted. Great show, great product. Not much else to say, it's DVDs in a box."
5,I love this show.,"I never watched it before and now catching up. I can't wait to get the next season!! I still watch the new ones,but am seeing the old ones too."
5,So funny!,Got this for my dad for Christmas and it was a hit! Neatly packaged and worth every penny. Great show!
5,Great season,I watched every episode of this season and it was well worth the wait. Even the gag reel was worth it.
4,Dive Logbook Review,Log book is good quality and hold your dive log book (book not included). There is room for a dive calculator and other items. I'm happy with the purchase.
3,okay,Overall It is okay quality. But the zipper is already broken. I guess I'll live with it for now...unless they will exchange it.
5,From the Publisher,"""Yes, they're photographs; no, they're not paintings, nor have they been retouched, tinted, or digitally manipulated. Masatomo Kuriya obtains his extraordinary images from his attention to background colors (he does paint those); from his facility in ikebana, the ancient, formalized art of flower arrangement; and from exposing his images on Cibachrome.

3,Disappointed,"I guess I just don't get it-I expected a black comedy, but all I read was simply black. I didn't find Shapiro's narrator either believable or likable. Her prose is beyond reproach, but the characters-and the situation-didn't appeal to me, make me think, make me laugh, or in any way really move my emotions. I would rather hate a novel than feel ambivalent about it, as I do with this one."
1,Whatta Drag,"Reading the Dangerous Husband is a little like having a world-weary bowel movement -- painfully excrementory, but not without a wee bit of relief when it's all through.The characters are hardly credible and the story line is just, well, shall we say, contemptible? It was obviously written post haste with an eye on an even quicker buck. Oh, well, I suppose there are better ways to turn a trick.Jane, please, oh, please, keep your day job."
1,Literary Decrepitude,"The gushing Amazon reviewer must really possess a tawdry mind to appreciate this yuppie farrago, probably owns the entire Adrian Lyne video collection too. Ha!"
2,Kind of fun to read but ultimately disappointing.,"This book was a page-turner and pretty juicy, but in the end I kept wondering, What's the point? It had enough meaninlgess events and left me with enough unanswered questions that I frankly didn't care. I never felt any connection with any of the characters, and really only felt sorry for the pets. The relationship between the narrator and Dennis never seemed loving or intimate--just two people living in the same house, having sex, and talking to each other almost like hostile, defensive strangers. Their motives--for getting married, for staying married, for the things Dennis did--were not clear, yet also not that much of a mystery because they didn't make sense. A little more detail and character development would've been nice. I kept waiting for it all to come together, and when it didn't, it left me feeling unsatified."
4,A Great Book Club Book,"I highly recommend A Dangerous Husband as a book club selection. The men and women in my group all came away with something different. The most interesting conclusion was that this was a classic story of spousal abuse with the couple spreading the injuries around at all the different hospitals only the outrageous stories of how the ""accidents"" happened were true. A darkly funny read with a great climax."
2,A simple review,"The Dangerous Husband is annoying and overwritten. The story and characters are not engaging. Most importantly, the writer apparently is under the delusion that she's amusing, that her storytelling is funny. I didn't chuckle even once. Not clever, not insightful, not significant. The whole thing felt dated and desperate. Near the end, I actually was making a mental note to myself never to read anything by Jane Shapiro again. Skip this one."
2,Well-written but not particularly enjoyable,"At first, I thought about giving up on the book. The relationship between the characters--particularly their sex life--seemed nothing but unpleasant. Toward the end, however, it became both funny and menacing, which I assume was the author's intent all along. This mood should have emerged earlier, however, to make some of the protagonist's decisions plausible. The degree of their isolation was difficult to believe, as well. Couldn't she just have gotten a job and made friends through it? That's what the rest of the world does, after all."
5,"Great book, great story teller","I've read and reread this book several times. I've purchased several copies to give to friends and family. I believe the author is genuine. This book is the first in a trilogy that depicts an amazing life changing journey. The Foundation for Shamanic Studies, referenced in the book is a real foundation with the highest integrity, from whom I have taken several workshops prior to finding this author's work."
5,Super Entertaining!!!!,"The title of this book called upon me! I was intrigued by it, although when the author talked in ""anthropologist language"" I felt out of place, but then the story became so interesting, it reaches down to your soul, something inexplicable, I identified so much with the story that the ending left me longing for so much more. Excellent book, I would recommend it anytime!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,At the deeper levels...,"At first I was very intrigued by this author and his narrative. The story seemed to have a lot to offer. But the problem we all have when reading spiritual books is how to separate the wheat from the chaff. Someone who had done their homework, could undoubtedly, read the literature and put together their own book. What really separates true experiences from imagination? And what good is imagination in achieving greater a spiritual connection with the universe?For me, the deciding factor is, whether or not the work speaks to me. I set the book down for a few days and meditated on the contents. As I reviewed the book and it's themes, I am sorry to say, I think it is more likely a scientific reduction of the shamanic experience to an agenda of fighting global warming."
5,Absolutely Fascinating!,"If you are looking for a real page turner, and are interested in various metaphysical phenomena, then I would highly recommend this book for you.Spiritwalker is about the true story of a series of visions the author, Hank Wesselman, experienced while living in a home on the edge of an active volcano in Hawaii. Through these visions, Mr. Wesselman realizes that the young man he is seeing is actually himself - 5,000 years into the future!This book takes you a journey with the author...a journey to find himself, by himself. This is truly a fascinating journey, and it's written in such a way as to pull the reader in every step of the way.Overall, I found this book to be quite thought provoking, and to be perfectly honest, I literally could not put it down! I definately give this book a 2 thumbs up!"
3,More about relationships than flying,"I enjoyed the flying experiences they had and I think the book should have been more about that. Before they even started the flight, Rinker wrote the first third of the book about his rough relationship with his dad. The story of the flight was the most interesting thing in the book as far as I'm concerned, the rest belonged in a personal diary."
3,Mixed feelings,"The experience of two teenagers flying coast-to-coast is an exciting tale that deserves to be told. As long as the storyline focuses on the actual travel adventure, it makes for an interesting read. On the flipside, the author's lengthy description of his rather dysfunctional family situation gets tiresome before long. From a pilot's perspective I hope that the irresponsible, at times outright dangerous acts described in the book will not encourage the next generation of flyers to follow suit. Sadly, the book's supposed highlight, crossing the Rockies between two mountain peaks at high altitude in gusty wind conditions is the result of a blatant navigational error. By diverting 10 miles to the south and to lower terrain, this dangerous situation could have been avoided altogether..."
2,Fun reading but...,"I'm trying to convince my teen-age nephew to spend the summer with me in California so I can teach him to fly. I was considering sending him a copy of FLIGHT OF PASSAGE along with a letter promising to let him make a flight like that if that's what he'd like. But as a flight instructor I just can't send him the book in good conscious. The kids in FLIGHT OF PASSAGE swear more than anyone I've ever met-and that's saying a lot! They spend the night drinking with a very disreputable type, fly hung over the next morning and run a Grayhound bus off the road in a game of chicken! Fun is fun and I sure don't think of myself as a prude but after twelve years as a professional pilot I know it's this sort of disregard for the rules that gets kids killed!"
1,Promotion of illegal aviation activities? A teens struggle?,"This book is a memoir of a teen's trip across the United States in a J-3 Piper Cub and the struggle between a teen and his father. The tale of the trip is interesting, but please spare me the struggle bit. It is as if no other teen has ever had a struggle with his father's personality. Unfortunately the book was not a promotion of general aviation and only served the image many have of general aviation pilots. We are all a bunch barnstorming, death defying individuals. Sorry, but as a commercial pilot I cannot applaud the frequent and flagrant violations of the Federal Aviation Regulations committed by the Bucks."
5,This shoe fits a non pilot as well as a seasoned veteran,"My wife brought this book to me out of good luck. ""Looks like something you might like""-- couldn't put it down. I am fasinated by planes, but I found myself thinking about situations with my family and friends from the past to the future. Amazingly entertaining,,, spiritual not technical. should be 6 stars.."
5,A Really Good Read.,"This memoir is the best I've read in quite a while. I really didn't want the boys' flight to end. Well written, funny, educational, and with a great sense of discovery.It would make a great screenplay.Buy this book!!"
5,Outstanding flying adventure!,"I am a new private pilot and devour anything aviation related, so I very much enjoyed the flying theme of this book. But even without the flying aspect, it is a great story of how complicated father/son relationships can be and the bonding between brothers. It is a very touching story. Mr. Buck is a solid author as well, which is not always a prerequisite for writing a memoir."
3,"to me, this doesn't work","i usually enjoy the fudge's cover songs they do on their releases. this tribute cd to led zep doesn't work for me. it probably isn't their fault either. ""classic rock"" stations have beaten to death most songs they play on the radio. after years and years of hearing led zep songs, they are kind of hardwired into our brains. to hear r&b versions of the songs just doesn't appeal to me. musically, they do okay, but the mark's vocal style is hard to get used to in this setting. on some of the slower songs, such as ""all of my love"" and ""babe, i'm gonna leave you"" the band sounds fine. other than that, these songs are too ingrained into me to enjoy r&b versions of them. if you are more open and receptive to alternative versions to classic songs, you might enjoy this cd. i didn't."
2,creative toy but...,"I got these for my niece, she was to turn 1 just after Christmas. The first thing she did was place it in her mouth. She has teeth. Her tooth imprints were in the 'foam' and not too shortly after she 'played' (ate) with them the paint was coming off. Good toy idea--but bad. Not a good recommendation."
3,"Interesting in parts, not gripping as a whole...","I read biographies almost exclusively, and to find several folk in one book is nice. However, some of these people were merely ""attached"" to the people Mr. Burke was profiling. It's kind of like the line from SpongeBob: ""I knew this guy, who knew this guy, who knew this guy, who knew this guy..."" That was something I didn't care for-unsubstantiated things being put forth.However, I will thank Mr. Burke for prompting me to purchase ""Unconquered"" the story of Jerry Lee Lewis, Jimmy Swaggart, and Mickey Gilley. (See my review of that book...)All in all this was kind of like drinking a warm soda on a hot day-yeah your thirst is somewhat quenched, but not really."
3,New York architecture in the late 1800s,"With over 1100 pages, this book was so difficult to handle physically, that it hampered my enjoyment of this epic-length volume. On the other hand, the book is a bargain in terms of cents per page! Photos average more than one per page; however, the quality of photographic reproduction is frequently very disappointing (even when compared to Stern's 'New York 1900,' which also uses very old photographs). There are approximately 75 floor plans, with most page space used for the less-than-rivetting text. Chapters are divided by building type. A surprising amount of page space is consumed by illustrations of entries in architectural competitions (Union League Club and Cathedral of St. John the Divine)."
2,I was disappointed.,"This period was covered in New York 1900, which provided background material from 1876 and before. Although New York 1880 is longer than New York 1900, it seemed to me to be a padding of what had already been said in a more succinct and more readable way in the first book of the series (NY 1900).As for the length, New York 1880 badly needs an editor."
2,No good!,"I bought this water boiler after a lot of search, thinking that I'm moving over seas and will like to take something of good quality regarless the price!! Now I can't send it back and the alarm stopped working after the 2nd week, I have to be on top of it!!!! Every time boil water :("
5,I Wish I'd Had the Breville Years Ago!,"I purchased The Breville SK500XL Electric Kettle based on the recommendation of a friend. I felt it was an extravagant purchase, but with 4 tea- and cocoa-drinkers in the family, I decided to take the plunge. The Breville is exceptional! The base/heating element stays on the counter and you remove the kettle, which is lightweight and easy to fill. It is NOT loud whilst boiling; but yes, it does continue to heat a few seconds after it has reached boiling point. The pleasant chime, not too loud, lets you know the water is boiling and ready to go. The water level indicator has a pretty blue glow, and the see-through lid is nice and wide to accomodate filling. I truly wish I'd purchased this electric kettle for our family years ago!"
4,Breville electric kettle,"This kettle does what it's advertised to do. It boils water very quickly, it's very convenient to use and it looks great. My only criticism, and it's a small one, is that the automatic shut-off feature takes a little too long to activate, allowing the water to boil for a few more seconds before shutting down."
1,Worst Tea Kettle EVER!!!!,"This kettle never performed properly - boiled for quite a while before shutting off and did not shut off when not enough water - and it's clunky when pouring. Now, after only 14 months, it's shorting out and stops on its own but doesn't shut off.I have had several electric kettles over the last 3 decades, any one of which would be an improvement!"
4,Quality product at a great price,"What is there not love about this water kettle? It possess aesthetics, functionality and is just plan cool. You can buy less expensive kettles, but you will just be disappointed. I have no regrets in this great kettle."
2,NOISY!!!,"Works well, but its so, so, so loud. One other problem in its design is that it does not turn off as water boils resulting in a lot more steam than necessary."
1,stinky!,"yep, it looks great, has a really cool plug design, heats quickly, makes a nice 'ding' noise when it reaches the boiling point and reliably shuts off immediately after that- but the plastic smell and the taint it puts into the water make it useful only for boiling water that you use for....something other than drinks you can taste."
2,"Great look, horrible smell","I loved the look of this item and the sleek features that are included. However, the burnt plastic smell is overwhelming and does not go away. I bought this item and could not stand the taste of my tea so I brought it back thinking I got a bum one. I exchanged it for an identical new one and was hopeful that perhaps it was just a fluke. Unfortunately, I experienced the same problem again and after many washings and still the lingering taste and smell of burnt plastic, I am going to return this one too and try a new brand all together."
1,Bad smell and taste,"Although the appearance of the kettle is beautiful, it can't be used.There is bad burnt plastic smell from inside of the kettle and the water has strong unpleasant taste. I can guess it is unlikely to be healthy as well.Another minor problem with this kettle is that it is much easier to burn your hands than with a plastic one."
3,Strong Odor and Taste,"I have a few Breville products and have been very happy with them. This kettle looks great and heats water quickly, but the smell and taste are horrible. I spent a week doing constant cycles of boiling vinegar, boiling and discarding plain water, then boiling and discarding water and baking soda. SEVERAL of these cycles a day. It's been a couple of weeks now, and there is still a faint odor/smell, and I'm hoping it will completely disappear soon, but for at least the first week, the water was undrinkable. You could strongly taste a chemically-plastic taste in tea, instant coffee, etc... horrid. I'd pass on this one. There are other kettles out there you won't have to struggle so much to use!"
1,Great Idea Poorly Made,Soon after the warranty expired the light that allows you to see the water level began operating intermittently. Then about three months later it only heats intermittently. It will be in the garbage as soon as a simple stove top is found.
3,Great kettle but broke after 2 years of use.,"I love how this kettle looks and it worked great for 2 years then it started taking longer and longer for it to switch off when it started boiling, then it kept blowing the sockets and they had to be reset. Now it has just packed up altogether. Warranty is only 1 year, so i guess i have to buy a new one."
2,Simply stopped working.,"After a few months, this kettle simply stopped working. The kettle doesn't make good contact with the base. It's an incredibly poor design. It's so frustrating, because the kettle itself is still perfect, the base, I'm sure is perfect, but I can't get it to work. I've tried cleaning the contact, and rubbing it with an eraser. It sort of helped marginally for a few times, (it would go on and off) but then, just stopped altogether. I called the company, but they said I should have sent in the warranty card, now I can't prove I've had it for under a year. I liked the convenience, and I think it's probably the most energy efficient way to boil water, so I'll look for another kettle with a different design. I'm very frustrated that I have to just throw this one away."
5,"Durable, effective, beautiful","We had several of these in our offices for the last several years, and they held up great under heavy use. I finally bought one for home. This thing seems to be a workhorse. It boils quickly and we haven't had any problems with it so far, after about 8 months of use. We probably boil .75L of water four times per day.Two drawbacks that don't bother me but might bother you:1. You can't set the temperature. It'll give you boiling water. BOILING. So if you're a green tea person, this one might not be for you.2. It boils for a little too long before shutting off. Maybe it wants to make sure the water is GOOD and BOILED, but apparently it hasn't had a science class lately and doesn't realize that boiling is boiling. So if I'm standing there waiting I take it off the base once I hear it boiling and flip the switch. No big deal for me an impatient person.Overall we love this kettle and will probably have it for a long time."
1,If you want to drown out all other noise,"The kettle seems to work fine. It is, however, THE NOISIEST appliance I have ever heard. My husband would like Amazon to take this back. I have a friend who has a stainless steel kettle that hardly makes any noise.How do I return this? I no longer have the box in which it came. Could you send a return authorization and free shipping label?Do you have another stainless steel kettle that is quiet? What is its capacity?Thank you."
1,Old Model / Early Failure,"I bought this electric kettle four month ago from a William & Sonoma Factory Store. From the outset the switch would not reset after a single use. Finally, the switch would not engage at all. The damped hinge on the domed lid leaked what appeared to be tar around the lip of the opening. After some research, I found that the kettle, which I purchased at regular retail, had been replaced in the regular William & Sonoma stores with a newer model that was visually indistinguishable from the old model. I am awaiting an in warranty replacement without much enthusiasm. The combination of a defective product with an untrustworthy retailer is a killer. From now on follow my example and buy from Amazon."
3,"large, elegant but clumsy","I make lots of hot tea, water must boil (not just heat) and do so quickly. The kettle should also switch off automatically. The Breville looks great but it's a little too large which makes handling a pot of hot water a little precarious for my wife and son. All this is ok, just plan ahead when filling, but what is not ok is the time it takes this product to switch off. My kitchen is full of steam and the water boils hard for more than 45 seconds before the auto-switch kicks in and I cannot find a way to adjust this. Every other kettle I have had (many) triggers the off state far quicker and with less atmospheric impact :) More than once I just feel this kettle will never switch off so I hit the off button myself. This might be a minor inconvenience for those who only use it on occasion or who are content to stand over it and switch it manually but for routine use in our home, it's a shortcoming."
2,PLASTIC touches the water inside,"I bought this based on other reviews, and someone wrote that no plastic touches the water. This is wrong, unfortunately. PLASTIC TOUCHES THE WATER! There are plastic screws holding on the handle and a plastic spout. Disappointing--I am returning it. Otherwise, it looks nice..."
2,Not Worth The Price And Disappointment,"Although I read many of the reviews posted here, I threw caution to the wind and bought this product because of its looks. Silly me. As others have mentioned, it is noisy, the measuring glass is very difficult to read, it takes much longer to boil water than the maker claims, and, the BAD SMELL. After returning this kettle, I took some good advice from these reviews and bought an Aroma kettle from Target and I am very pleased. Don't be seduced by the elegant appearance as I was. Steer clear of this over-hyped and over-priced product."
1,Good-looking piece of junk,"The only one star goes to the designer who created a good-looking kitchen item. It looks nice (and that's why I bought it) but as a kettle it's awful.It boils with a huge amount of steam and all my wall cabinets are completely wet. The 'boiling noise' is too loud. And the worst - it's not insulated and gets extremely hot, it's absolutely unacceptable, we've burned all our hands... If you have kids (even teens) just don't buy it, otherwise you may need tons of Neosporin."
3,Short life span,"I absolutely loved this kettle until it stopped working just shy of 3 years. Really no complaints about it until it just died...it looks nice, it heats water fast, it has the automatic shut off...but now it's going to the dump!"
5,For the tea lovers among us,I LOVE my kettle. It is actually a replacement for the exact same model - my husband put my first one on the electric stove??????Looks wonderful in my kitchen - and boils water - quickly. PERFECT
5,I love it!!!,"I have always wanted an electric kettle ever since the time I lived in England. The kettles there would boil water in a heartbeat. Kettles here, however, never measured up...until now! This kettle boils water as fast as the english ones and looks 100% better than theirs do, plus it's cordless! The Breville is superb!"
3,Slightly disappointed,"Kettle looks nice and boils water just fine. But it fells short comparing to our old cheap plastic braun we had before for 7 years. Breville's walls are hot to touch, when it is done and a little bit of steams comes sometimes from somewhere under the handle. Water level indicator placement is inconvenient at least. I can not see water level until I turn the kettle on. It boils water much slower than old braun. What I like is blue glow when kettle is on and nice chirp sound when it is done."
2,Does Not Last,"This kettle looks great and works great until it breaks. I have ordered a couple and the following problems happened after some time. The button for opening the lid stopped working after the firs six months. The automatic switch off took longer and longer to activate - the water will be boiling for minutes before the kettle is turned off. Eventually after about three years of use the kettle completely broke. As this appliance is pricey, it is my expectation that it should last longer than that. I'm exploring other options for my next purchase, possibly a similarly priced Krups kettle."
4,First one was defective. Happy with replacement,"It's the best looking of all the competing products, and not the most expensive, though it's up there. The Aussie's swear by it.The lid wouldn't stay closed on the first one we received. The replacement works fine, and we're happy with the efficiency of the replacement process."
3,Not great,The first one that I received had a faulty electrical connection so it only worked sometimes. The replacement one seems o.k. but takes much longer to boil than the Braun that I had before.
4,hot water fast,"bought this electric kettle for my mom to replace a regular whistling tea kettle. she sometimes forgets or doesn't hear the whistling when the kettle comes to a boil. so rather have any problems for that, decided to get an electric one that will automatically shut off after coming to a boil and left unattended. works great and heats water up in a minute or two."
5,Great kettle!,"I bought this kettle after reading the reviews with some trepidation. Yes the kettle is heavier than most but its a good grade stainless steel. So yes it will be hot on the outside. BUT as a very heavy kettle user, this kettle is by far the best I have ever owned. It looks great with the rest of my appliances, I love the lid, and I had a metallic taste once when we first got the kettle. It cleans easily as well. Amazon sent this out quickly and it arrived in top rate condition."
5,Great kettle,"I just got this kettle to replace one made by Bravetti. The old one was a great kettle but broke after only two months of use. I did lots of research and decided on this one. I was a bit nervous about the reviews which complained about the rubbery odour but I made sure to fill the kettle three times, boil the water and dump it and the first cup of tea I made was fine. As long as this kettle holds up I will be very happy with it."
5,"Use it everyday, love it!","We used to have an electric kettle that looked like the traditional tea-pot. It did the job but we didn't know measurements and we couldn't heat up other liquids (i.e. stock) because it was so hard to clean. This little guy looks great on the counter and is a work-horse. Just be careful, don't burn yourself like I have if you accidentally touch the sides after it's done heating."
4,excellent electric kettle,Breville sent me this model to replace another Breville tea kettle which broke within the warranty period. I was so pleased with it that I purchased another one for our vacation home. It is an efficient and good looking kettle and because it is stainless steel it doesn't leave a bad taste in the boiled water as other tea kettles do that I have purchased in the past.
1,Nice while it worked!,"We purchased this Breville electric kettle a few years ago and it was great while it worked. Heats up fast. Turns itself off and a bell dings when it boils. Unfortunately, things began breaking down. First, the light went out. Not a big deal since it wasn't necessary for the overall function. Then, we'd flip the switch to the ""on"" position and nothing would happen at all unless we removed the pot from the base and repositioned it. This was very inconvenient and annoying, because you had to listen to hear whether or not the pot had ""kicked on,"" so we called Breville support and they kindly sent us a new base. That worked for a couple of weeks and then the same problem was back. This time when we called, Breville was not so supportive. So now we have a lovely stainless steel pot that really can only function as a pricey flower vase! For the price we paid, I would expect better quality. Too bad few things are meant to last more than a few years anymore!"
2,Not good for more than occasional use,"After having my wonderful trusty Hobbes electric tea kettle for over 10 years till I dropped it last year, I needed a kettle that would work well with repeated use. After reading the reviews, I chose the Breville Ikon. It looks great and, at first worked well, but what a mistake! After about a year, I started having the same problem with the connection on the base not working. First it was occasional; now I can hardly get it to work at all! What a rip-off! The mfg should change the engineering on this so it works for more than a year....especially at this price!Breville SK500XL Ikon Cordless 1.7-Liter Stainless-Steel Electric Kettle"
5,FINALLY FOUND A GOOD ONE!,"This one heats immediately, leaves absolutely no foul odor in the water, as many do. Simply does what it's supposed to. I've tried many before this one and would recommend it completely."
1,Review of Breville SK500XL electric kettle,"Great looking electric kettle, all steel construction.No plastic in contact with the water.Lights up the water with a blue light while in use, and rings a bell when the boil is completed.I purchased this kettle a little less than 3 years ago.However, in my opinion, this kettle has one big design defect.The ON switch does not automatically switch to OFF when the kettle is off the base causing arcing on the contacts when inserting into the base.The kettle now no longer turns on reliably when plugged into the base, after less than 3 years of normal use.This is the kettle with the shortest service life of all the kettles that I have owned.If Breville improve the design, and add the auto-off feature when the kettle is off the base, it would be a great buy."
3,"was a nice hot water kettle, while it works.","Our Ikon Breville SK500XL has worked for a little over two years. If you've read any of the other non-5-star reviews you'll see this is an apparently common time for problems to show up.Now it doesn't turn off anymore when it comes to a boil, and sometimes shorts out and has to be allowed to cool for half an hour to get it to work again. The lid button sometimes doesn't work and stays open.It's frustrating, but any modern product made in China tends to be created with planned obsolescence in mind, so we aren't too surprised. Just wish the higher end (higher priced) electronics would last longer. Or at least be easily fixable.***********ETA: Got a replacement. Was very disappointed at the changes Breville seems to have made. More plastic parts, including plastic on the lid where it used to be a good quality tempered glass. It is also leaking from 2 holes on the bottom. My 2 year old one NEVER did that. :(Am lowering my stars accordingly.**************"
3,Breville pros and cons,"I am ready to jettison my second Breville electric kettle. First one lasted just over a year until the spring loaded turn off mechanism failed. The second one now has rusty stains in bottom of kettle. Tried to clean out with cleansers and special sponge but the metal appears to have corroded. And again this is just about a year and half of usage. Granted it is used multiple times a day and has been a work horse. Now I'm looking for alternative, maybe glass, but the glass options offered by Amazon and the reviews are not encouraging to change to that material due to various problems. I've bought a couple of Braun kettles over the years and have been satisfied with them but they are higher priced and are good for only a couple of years as well. I can only conclude that I'm asking too much by wanting these type of kettles to last 5 years or more."
1,"Only lasts a year, company does not stand behind their product.","We bought this tea kettle January 2010. Recently we had a problem with the contacts connecting and the water boiling. I contacted the company and because the warranty expired I was told that I would have to purchase a new base, which I did. When the base arrived it did not work. I contacted the company to let them know and they said they do not take returns. So now I sit with two bases and a tea kettle that doesn't work. I have read most of the reviews and have found others that had the same problem. When I first purchased my tea kettle I was very happy with it as are many who rated it currently 5 stars. I am curious as to what they think after a year when it stops working."
3,"great at first, now having problems.....","I bought this kettle about 1.5 years ago and use it to boil water for tea and drip coffee 2 - 3 times a day. It worked well until a couple of months ago. The kettle no longer makes contact with the bottom plug in unit unless you move it around until it finally contacts and turns on. And about 1 week ago, it no longer does that. There is a lot of obvious wear on the electrical contact bump on the bottom unit and, considering I have been using this kettle for less than two years, that doesn't seem right. There are no children using this kettle, it has never fallen nor been hit, struck or otherwise mishandled. Would be interesting to hear if any other purchaser has experienced the same issue after daily use for over a year (past warranty, unfortunately).I like the kettle and it performed well for a time but I feel it is too expensive to have to replace it after less than two years."
2,Faulty base design,"The kettle no longer gets power from the base. It appears that the contacts in the base have become corroded. It is still possible to make it work be swiveling it a lot, but that is a pain. A pity because ti's great when it works. I'm thinking of buying a replacement base for it."
2,Rust!,"I'd almost decided that after testing half a dozen electric kettles, the Breville SK500XL Ikon was the one. It looked top quality and I loved the blue light that illuminates the water level. And although the water boil auto shut-off takes about 7-10 seconds too long to do its thing, I could live with that. It's also about 20% larger than need be, taking up too much space on the counter. Again, I could live with this. But what I can't live with is the rust forming at the bottom of the kettle. After just a week, I noticed there's rust forming where the bottom of the pot meets the sides. Apparently the seam isn't stainless steel or water has leaked below, causing rust on the underside which must not be stainless steel. Regardless, this is unacceptable. Breville needs to check this design because it's flawed if this is what happens when things aren't 100% properly welded.Returning to Amazon, and the search continues."
1,Dangerous design,"Bottle surface is so hot that burnt our handsInside the kettle got rusted that we no longer dare to use the boiled water to wash our baby bottlesI had to stay away from Krups because I kept getting leaky kettles, but this product is not much better and even dangerousvery disappointed for a product of this expensive price"
1,Failed after 18 months,"This is the second Breville product I've bought that has failed just after the warranty expired(the other was a juicer that we only used about 5 times, but unfortunately it sat on the shelf for over a year first). I'll never by one of their products again."
5,Great Cordless Kettle!,We bought the Breville cordless kettle to replace a plastic kettle that started leaking. So far we've found it to be superb! We use it several times a day to heat water for coffee or tea. The only a minor issue is that moisture forms on the inside of the top of the kettle which can be overcome by leaving the top open to air dry. I couldn't be more pleased and highly recommend the Breville SK500XL Ikon cordless kettle.
3,Quality smells,"First off, Amazon's part in this was excellent. The product arrived in good shape and ahead of schedule. The kettle itself was well-designed and of excellent quality. There, however, is where the problem started. On opening it, there was a heavy, oily smell. This is not unusual for steel items, so I went about boiling a couple of kettles as recommended in the instructions. After the sixth time, the oily smell was still present, and was strong enough to contaminate the tea. I even tried boiling a water-white vinegar solution and leaving it overnight according to the instruction - to no avail. Finally sent it back - a process which was painless and quite easy, by the way."
1,Electric contact wears off,"I owned two Breville kettles. They both failed the same way. I know a lot of people are happy with the Breville kettles but most don't realized after a year or two of constant use, the electric contact between the base and the kettle will soon wear off. That means, the on button will not light and the unit will not work. I called Breville and found out that this new unit has the same electric contact mechanism. If you plan to use this for more than one or two years, I would consider another brand."
1,Nearly...,"For an Englishman abroad (i.e. I need gallons of tea a day), this product looked like the bees knees - the best kettle out there. And it is without doubt a good-looking machine with lots of great features. But unfortunately it has one fatal flaw - the hot water that comes out of it smells of plastic. I thought this would pass with a bit of use but no, the nasty boiled plastic smell remained. In the end I sent it back and bought a Braun instead. Shame, in every other respect this is an excellent machine."
5,Love this kettle,"This kettle is the best one I've ever used. It's perfect in every way - except that I don't like that it's a bit heavy. Had it for about 2 years and no problems, no rust, looks like new!"
1,Planned Obsolescence?,"I purchased this kettle in the last year, and now the contacts between the kettle and base have failed and do not stay connected when the kettle is powered on. I contacted Breville, and because I did not have my receipt they asked me the batch number on the unit. I provided it, and I was told this number showed when the kettle was manufactured and that it was manufactured 3 years ago. Although the item could have been sold (to me) far later than the manufacturing date, Breville is using this manufacturing date as a reason to deny the 1 year warranty agreement.Don't be fooled by the sleek design and name. Breville is apparently not interested in standing behind it's products any longer. This kettle is entirely too expensive to last for such a short time."
3,Good Kettle but only last for two years,"We have had this kettle for exactly 2 years and one month. It worked great for the past two years. Now the auto shut-off is not working, which means the boil-dry protection is not working too. we are maunally shut it off everytime when we use. This is not a durable product and it only last for two years. I am looking for a new kettle to replace it..."
1,Touchy Finish,"My SK500XL Ikon kettle arrived with an odd dent, so I returned it. I would've exchanged for a new one, but noticed the finish was very touchy and showed fingerprints like crazy. I ended up buying the Breville One-Touch Tea Maker... it was 3 times the price and it definitely looks like it. In the end, all it really does is boil water, but it looks cool on the counter. So, if fingerprints are a deal-breaker, then pass on this one. If you're still interested, read some of the positive reviews."
2,Light shorts out,"After using this kettle for a year the light on the side, under the handle began blinking on a off, like a strobe. I saw a few other people on here had the same problem. It still functions but what really irritates me is that when I called Breville to ask about repairing or replacing it they were rude and couldn't offer any help. Not the type of company I will ever do business with again. Buy from another, more reputable company."
2,Pot burns out after 1 year,"I have had this hot water maker for a year and this morning I saw the element was burned out. Last night I smelled a burning smell and saw the pot was hot even though I had not used it for a couple of days (it was plugged in). I unplugged it and kept it unplugged until I went to use it today and saw it wasn't working. Now I will have to buy a new pot but this time I will buy a different brand. This pot is too expensive to need replacement every year plus I worry about the fire hazard. I suggest others with this brand only plug it in before use. I kept mine plugged in, but even so, that SHOULD have NOT been a problem."
5,Long boil time.,"We got this kettle to replace other brand unit that started to leak after a year. We are using it for over a month, at least 30 times a day and are very pleased with the purchase. This unit works nice, no smell or taste problems. Comparing to the other kettle this one boils water almost for a minute, not just for 5 seconds. When water is done a soft bell ring will let you know."
3,fantastic but leaked within a few months,"Everything about this kettle is great, from its ease of cleaning, to speed of heating, to the nice feel of the handle. The problem was that, after ordering it new, in a few months water it was leaking after leaving it overnight with water in it. I didn't mind for a month but it eventually ruined the circuit (when I plug it into any outlet it activates the circuit-breaker). It's not like you can hold it up and see anything leaking, but perhaps it's more where it fits into contact to the base when it's sitting on it. Anyways, I'm getting a different kettle but that's too bad."
4,One hot kettle,"In search of a new kettle we discovered the Breville after looking at many other types. We really liked this one because it has a large top opening making it easy to fill. It also fits well into our refrigerator's filtered water dispenser. When switched on, the blue light looks very nice and when completed the little ding of a bell announces it is ready. Overall, we like this kettle a lot and really the only thing that may be a slight negative is that it seems to boil the water a little slower than our previous type."
2,broken in a short while,"i first purchased the SK550 model. in less than 3 uses it had to be returned for warranty repair/replacement. when they sent it back, guess what, they sent me the SK500 model.i didn't have problems with the unit initially - not even the bad smell that seems to impact a lot of people. however, just as soon as the warranty period is over - BOOM - the unit stopped working.i am a household of one - i used it only several times a week - not every day. so for it to go out on me in that short period of time is a waste. i liked it otherwise and it looked good. now i'm really debating if i should get another one. really have doubts though."
1,horrible kettle,"I bought this kettle some time ago. I hate it for the following reasons:1. Very noisy from start to end. VERY NOISY!2. When the water boils, it continues boiling water for 2-3 minutes (why?? hellooo.. it's already boiled!) and it doesn't go off. While boiling all this time, it produces SO MUCH steam that all my cabinets above the kettle become really wet -- it's unbelievable!!What a waste!+ Amazon return policy sucks. I realized that there are better kettle on a market (for example stainless steel electric kettle Krups - the design is much better + no issues that described above) but I was not able to return this kettle to Amazon because it was over 1 month. Very disappointed. Be aware!"
2,Stopped Working After Four Years...,"I expect appliances that are used sparingly to last for years, but I suppose that I am asking too much in the era of throwaway consumer goods...The Ikon worked for four years and then suddenly stopped lighting-up and heating water. It was used less than once a day for heating water for tea.Judging from the Ikon reviews posted since I purchased mine in 2006 and the reviews of many other electric kettles on Amazon, I think that I will go back to heating my tea water on the stove using a simple whistling tea kettle."
3,Usability sacrificed for looks,This was a replacement to another kettle that lasted 3 months. It has survived its first three months and still boils water - a key requirement.Pros:- Clean lines- Easy fill top- Pours well- Boils fastCons:- on/off switch located under the handle- water gauge hidden under handle- outside gets extremely hot when water is boiledIt seems like no one actually looked at the usability of the design after the designers were done. The water gauge is hidden from normal view and have they not heard of thermal insulation because the exterior will burn you when the water's hot.At least it still works....for now
2,"Great, except no longer shuts off","This worked well for about two years. Now, it won't turn off after it reaches the boiling point. These should last much longer, especially for a family that drinks tea just a few days per week."
2,Doesn't Last,"The Breville kettle did a fine job for 18 months, but after that it was all downhill. Water started leaking from the bottom of kettle and then it just completely died - less than 22 months since we purchased it. I expected more."
1,Seriously NOT RECOMMENDED,Piece of ... junk. Got it at the end of October. It died this morning 4/26.Seriously NOT RECOMMENDED.
2,Flawed product?,"I have spent way too much time looking for a good electric kettle. After looking at the reviews on the Breville, I went ahead and bought it at Bed,Bath, & Beyond with my 20% off coupon. When I first rinsed it out and boiled a pot of water, I thought I had found a great kettle. However, when I emptied the water and it air-dried I noticed small black spots on the bottom plate on the inside. I rinsed it out with diluted vinegar and tried it again, only for the same thing to happen with even more spots than before. I thought it was a defective product, so I returned it and bought another one. The same thing happened with the second one. I am still looking for a decent electric kettle!"
2,Breville electric tea kettle,"I loved the idea of having a tea pot and what I thought was a carafe in one, but not the case. The tea pot is loud when heating and the carafe does not stay warm so you have to heat it over and over. Also, hard to see where the water level is, so this was not the kettle for me. However, I still love Amazon...free shipping and quick delivery and returns."
3,good overall,Overall a good product but wish there was a built in temperature reading since I end up overheating water for green tea when much lower temp is required and depriving of the dissolved air. Good that one can read water level but it requires a minimum of .5 L of water to operate.
2,Lasted only 2 years,"Well, loved it while worked which was only 2 years under normal circumstances.What else can i say? Buy yours knowing this."
4,Great kettle...while it lasts,"Got this kettle as a wedding present about 4 years ago. I use it about 7 or 8 times a day, so heavy use.The auto shutoff was a bit slow, and I found myself just switching it off, which I'm guessing has something to do with the auto shutoff not working at all now. Also, only now, in the last few weeks, has the light stopped working. It still boils water, though, which I'm sure is the most important thing!Nice build, lots of stainless steel. Lovely handle with push button under your thumb to open the lid. It's a shame it's on it's way out. I would definitely recommend this if you aren't a heavy user, or you replae your kettle every 3 or 4 years."
2,disappointing,"I bought this kettle after my beloved 10 year old bodum kettle stopped working. This one looks pretty, but I'm British and drink tea multiple times a day. There is a faint metallic taste with this appliance and I had to take it back. The blue light was nice and it worked well, but I couldn't tolerate the taste. disappointing."
2,Works pretty well.,"I love that it detaches from the base. I had to get used to it because previous ones that I've had were corded. It never spills when I pour. It boils fast. The water indicator, while I thought at first I wouldn't use it, I have found it useful. My biggest complaint is the button on top that opens the lid.. sticks, ever since I first got it. I have to push it several times, and then it opens only partially and I have to use my hand to open it all the way. For the price I paid for this item, I expected better. If it wasn't for that, I would give it five stars. UPDATE: After about a year of use (I use it at work, an average of 5x a week), water leaked into the water indicator, so it's really difficult to see how much water is in it. With these defects, I do not see this as a very quality item, I do not feel like I got what I paid for!"
3,"Half good, half bad.","We've had our Breville kettle for over a year. On the positive side, this kettle boils water very quickly, is easy to clean, and looks beautiful. On the negative side, the sides of the kettle get very hot - hot enough to give you a small burn if you're not careful. And, my biggest complaint, it takes a long time to automatically shut off. Your water will be boiling away steaming up the room for several minutes before the kettle 'dings.' Still, the goods outweigh the bads. We wish it were a better kettle, especially for the money, but we are at least satisfied."
1,Do not buy,While I love the look of this kettle I have to return it for 3 reasons:1. It is so loud I am afraid to turn it on in the morning so it doesn't wake up my son.2. It makes my tea taste bad.3. The kettle is not isulated and it gets very hot.
1,Failed after 1 week,"Product stopped working after one week. Breville wont replace until I send it back. They will supply return label, so no cost to me except my inconvenience. There are so many refurbished Breville products in the market, I should have realized that means they often stop working. I would not buy another product from this company."
2,Body gets excessively hot,"The steel body gets excessively hot, you can't even keep your hand on the body for more than 2 secs. We bought one from here and returned it the next day. Avoid this."
1,"Amazon's Questionable, ""Service""","This is a review of Amazon's service, not one of the actual kettle. I ordered this kettle 5 days ago and not only has it not shipped, but Amazon won't allow me to cancel my order. If I'd known that I'd be left hanging, I never would have ordered from them. Amazon usually has great service; with this order, they FAILED."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this kettle as a gift for my daughter, however, the metallic taste after the water has been boiled and then cooled in the fridge is nauseating and I sent her a glass kettle instead. Very disappointed."
3,Everything good...but SLOW,"This is the slowest kettle I have ever owned. It takes what feels like FOREVER to start the boil and then takes even longer to auto-shut off. My past two kettles were Russell Hobbes which boil much faster. The first one lasted 20 years. The other one I purchased recently as a replacement but I thought the Breville would be better and faster. Not really the case. It is a lot more pleasing to the eye, but just doesn't get the job done the way I want it. I may just have to return it."
4,"Well built, but a little loud!","This electric water heater feels very solid and well built. When filled to 1.7 liters, it takes about 6 min 30 seconds to boil. The kettle automatically shuts off when it boils and makes a nice bell noise when finished. I thought this would be annoying, but it is not! Also, when switched on, there is a nice white LED lighting up the water supply making it easy to read.My only complaint about this kettle is that it is rather loud (which is why I only gave it 4 stars) when it is on. A few moments after the switch is turned on, it makes this rumbling noise for the entire duration of operation."
2,Lasted for almost one year,"It is a great looking kettle but it stopped working in less than a year. Unfortunately, I was unable to find a triangular screwdriver to fix it. Breville designers put a lof of effort designing the screws that can only be removed by the manufacturer."
2,Disappointed with plastic interior parts,I was looking to replace my beloved Braun electric tea kettle. I ordered this because I wanted an all-stainless kettle. I promptly returned it because there are plastic parts inside.
2,Didn't Last,"I bought this kettle about a year ago. Loved it so much I bought one for my daughter. First the light stopped working (no big deal), then it started leaking a little bit, now it won't start unless I move it around on the base. I did register it at Breville on line when I got it so I'm hoping for a replacement, but after looking at the reviews on their website I'm not sure I'll get one."
2,Failed after 12 months,We received this item as a wedding gift. It looks very nice and we enjoyed using it. However after 12 months now (warranty is only 12 months as well) the electrical contact at the base of the kettle no longer makes a connection. So the power will not turn on unless we PRESS the kettle into the connection and hold it there. I have read the other reviews and this seems to be a common problem. I would not recommend purchasing this kettle for long term use.
1,Dont buy this!!!,"I purchased the Breville kettle after owning kettles for years. This was the worst one I've ever owned. The auto shut off doesn't shut the kettle off when it should and steam shoots up on my cabinets for several minutes before turning off. The cabinets get so wet, I have to wipe the moisture off every time. The kettle also rusted on the bottom and sides within two months of use. The really bad thing was that Breville's customer service was horrible and basically said ""too bad"" and these items were not reason enough for an exchange!! I since purchased the Cuisanart PerfecTemp kettle and it works perfectly. I threw the Breville away and will not buy Breville products ever again after their pathetic customer service and poor quality merchandise!"
2,Finally died after 2+ years of service,"Not worth the priceIt boiled for at least five minutes before shutting off. For me, that was WAY too long to have a kettle boiling and steaming away. So, part of the convenience of the electric kettle was diminished.I did not like that there were plastic parts inside.It was faulty turning on after a couple years of daily service. It has been retired after exasperating attempts to swivel it on the base just right, until we heard a click, at which time it MIGHT work. I will miss the cute little chime when the bugger finally would turn off by itself! :)"
4,We like it :-),"Not the lightning speed I fantasized about but still pretty darn quick, and faster (more economical?) than the gas heat on the stove for the old fashioned kettle. I had read reviews about a funny taste so I took the preemptive action of treating it to a 5% vinegar solution run through three X and no problems with the taste of the water. We leave it open when not in use, just on instinct, about this smell issue. Not sure if that makes sense, but it works for the new washing machines. My husband, a tea drinker, loves it. We would highly recommend this product."
4,"Good so far, but....","Bought the Breville SK500 Ikon Electric Kettle about a week ago. So far so good, but NO WAY does it heat water to boiling in 130 seconds. It's a bit slower than the Braun I used for the past 6 months while in Europe. That and the claim on the box made me time it: comes out consistently to around 4 minutes, i.e. 240 seconds, not 130. On the plus side: the ergonomics are phenomenal. It really pours accurately. I have had none of the problems with bad taste others complain of and the lighted water gauge is very helpful. It's not cheap, but I am cautiously optimistic at this point."
1,Piece of junk.,"The Breville SK500XL is a good looking piece of junk. The thermostat does not shut off all of the time and it keeps boiling. The light goes out withing a couple of months of service. Worst of all, the connection for the heating element doesn't connect all away around the grid. The more you use it, the less of it works, until you are spinning the pot around the base trying to find a spot that connects. It might make a nice looking flower pot. An expensive one, at that."
3,Crazy Lady,In this book there is a boy named Vernon and he is the main characture there is also a mother or the Crazy Lady named Maxine and her son who is Ronald. Vernon is a sort of a boy who does not like weird people like maxine and Ronald at the begining but he begins to love them and understand how they live that way and why.Vernon also is an upset kid because his mother died when he was little and his father can not read or write. Maxine is a single mother and she is a drunk she walks in the road and yells and cusses at every body because she does not know how to control herself. Ronald is Maxines son he is slow and has trouble so he goes to a special school to help him out but he ends up leaving in the end it is soo sad
3,jana richview middle school,is about a crazy lady being very crazy.of something bad happing .at the end of the story her son and her daughter. sometimes thry will get along and sometimes they won't.At the beginning of the book they didn't get along.In the first chapter of crazy lady she was very crazy becase her mom had died when she was very small at the age of 7
1,Crazy Lady?!!?.....,"I read the book jacket and was like ""cool!"" But then I read the edittorial reviews and they were nothing like the book. :("
2,Language Content,My 10 yr old daughter brought this book home from her school library.She told me she really likes the book but pointed outsome bad language being said in the book that I believe most parents would not approve of.
3,my opinions,I rated crazy lady 3 stars because I liked it because it is a great thing to learn from vernon because Vernon judged Maxine before he knew her.Maxine turned out to be a good person when she didnt drink.I think Maxine is putting a bad example on Ronald when she drinks. I liked the end of the book. I hope Maxine changes and stops drinking.I think that would be good for Rounald.Im glad that Rounald got to go to the speacil olympics with Vernon.Vernon was a great help for MAxine and Rounald.It was good that Vernon helped them.
4,"my opinion on Maxine in""Crazy Lady""","At the beginning I thought that Maxine was a mean, hateful, and evil person, but later in the story I found that she was very nice and kind.I also think that Maxine should'nt have been so mean to Ronald and Vernon,but I liked this book very much.This book changed my opinion on alcoholics, because I thought that they were nasty and disgusting people,but now I know that they can be very nice."
3,What I Thought About Crazy Lady,I read the book Crazy Lady and I think it was ok. It teaches a lesson about not making fun of strange people. It is about a boy who learns to like a family that no one else likes. He likes them and he helps them out in many ways. This book surprises you in the end. You should check out this book at your local library. This book changed my view about autistic people and how to treat them and I know it will change yours to.
3,Crazy Lady,I did not like certain parts in this book. I don't think Maxine being drunk so much is a good thing. Vernon is nice though. Ronald is also nice. It showed me not to judge people by the way they look before knowing them.
2,This book was okay.,I thought it was okay because the charatcters were just okay. I used to think that all alchoholics were really bad people but now I know that some of them are really nice. Sometimes I think that mentally changlled people are mean but now I know that they are also nice people. Sometimes they can be mean and hateful but now I know that they are nice. I thought that Ronald changed Vernon in some way. So now I really like Vernon better than at the end than at the beginning.So it teaches you to not judge a book by its cover or a person either.
3,Crazy Lady,"I think that this book was a good lesson; it taught you not to judge a person before your know them. It also teaches that you can be friends with anyone. I think that Maxine gets drunk way too much! Vernon, a boy in the story,is a vey nice to Ronald, the mentally changelled kid. Also a another character in the story is Miss Annie, a teacher that retired, who has a walker, who helps Vernon get good grades, which is very nice!"
2,Crazy Lady,This book isn't very good. It really is boring. One of the good things in this book is the language. They talk like us except the swearing. It could have gone without the swearing. I liked how it really sounded like a kid talking. None of this proper english stuff. I think they need to add him getting kicked out of school or his friends die or ronald dies at least a little bit of action. Over all this book stunk!
2,It's okay...,"I can understand why some people like it. I like Vernon, and the other kids. But something about the story was weird. It was just an odd book. :("
4,a good leson for children of all ages to learn,"In my opinion, Crazy Lady is a good book for teaching kids how to make good choices and decisions.It shows how people from just one place can be so different but help each other. Many people decide to do certain things in life whether it helps them or they think it helps things get better but only makes things worse.In this book Friends come from the most unlikely places, but you will lose some and gain some."
2,"My Opinion for the Book ""Crazy Lady""","The book ""Crazy Lady"" was not very good. I disliked it becaus it was not very interesting. There was not many action things that took place.There should be a big action or thing that keeps the reader hooked on reading it.The book was okay.I dont think it a favorite though. The parts with Mrs. Annie and Vernon were not very interesting, nothing big happens there."
1,Crazy Lady Wasn't Great,"I HATED this book. The main charecter,Vernon, was to goody goody and wanted to solve everyones problems. Ronald, a mentaly challenged boy, didnt really know what as going on around him. Another charecter was Maxine. She got drunk to much. Vernon gets to know ronald and that was probally the best part. This book teaches alot of lessons about drinking, but I would not read it again."
3,Richards review for Crazy Lady,"I think that the book was pretty good, but I really did not like it.It was about a lady that drinks alot and how she is going through her problems.The lady has a child that she takes care of.In the middle of the story things start to get rough.When the lady started drinking in the middle of the book she was smashing bottles and being crazy.At the end of the book the lady sends her son away.I would not recommend this book to any of the students my age."
1,crazy lady...not my favorite book,I read Crazy Lady.It was horible. It was the most stupid book I read this year. I do not like serious books. I'm on the funny side. The book was about a drunk lady & her son that had mental problems. Their names were Maxine & Ronald. Maxine & Ronald got on my nerves because they got into so much trouble. There was a boy named Vernon. His mom died and he had issues in school. He was the main character in the book.
5,This Book is Crazy,I have read this book over 2 times and have enjoyed every time. It it really funny at times. It is a great book. My favorite part is when one of the main characters was running as fast as 30 miles per hour. He was racing a car. He fell and tripped and fell into some glass. He got really hurt. If you want to read a good book then read this book.
1,wouldn't recomend,"To me, this book was not a book I would normally read. It was more like a book that I would have read back in the elementary days. I didn't feel like I could relate to the book in any way at all. This book would have been a good book for learning about differences and disabilities but I do not believe I am doing that. The book does not really have an ending. It leaves you hanging which is one thing that I do not like about this book. I feel that this book could have a sequel. Hopefully that book will be more enjoyable."
1,Book Review for Crazy Lady,"I thought that this book was OK but I don't really like it because I always thought that mystery and scary books were good. Sometimes this book got a little confusing but not a lot. There was a lot of suspense in this story. But I don't think there was enough suspense. It got boring sometimes, like at the beginning it was really boring. I didn't like the ending because (...). If they're going to do that they should have made a sequel. Or did they? I don't know but they should have made the ending so they had Vernon actually catch up with Ronald and not trip and fall. Or at least have his dad take him to California where Ronald went or something like that. Overall I didn't really like the book because of the ending. Otherwise the book was good."
3,This book is okay.,"I thought this book was okay. I liked the beginning when Maxine or Crazy Lady was really nice to Vernon and that she did not get drunk like she did later in the book. Something I did not like about the story is how Maxine kept getting drunk and being mean to Vernon after all he did to her. Maxine does what ever she wants to do because nobody can stop her. I learned alot from this book. Ronald was a good kid even though he is mentally challenged. All because people need special attention, but that does not mean they are very stupid and can not do other things people can."
3,Alcochol,I rated Crazy Lady 3 stars because I like books that are eventure and saving people. Like real live things. As long as Maxine gets to see him I think it is fine. I also don't like hearing that the child is having a rough like because his mother is a alcoholic. That also bothers me and I loose my enterance that way. But also knowing that the child go with someone else. And it being family is okay. As long as they see the parent every now and then.
1,Crazy Book,I thought that this book was very wierd because Maxine and Ronald have a very wierd relationship between son and mother. Vernon is very nice to help Maxine and ronald. It very noor kids to have troble in school so its a realistic book in that way.
5,~*A Thoroughly Surprising Book*~,"I've read this book time and time again and find it to be not only entertaining and interesting but a bit humorous. The twisted life of Maxine is introduced to Vern when Vern is failing most of his classes. (This happens everyday.) He is intriduced to her when doing a good deed.(I wish all of my peers saw it that way.) Things spin on and on, Vern's grades impove and things become better for everyone. I will not tell you the ending , but from a teeenager's point of view, this book is rather realistly true and sad. Enjoy!!!!"
3,Crazy Lady!,"Crazy Lady was a good story at some places. The fair was a good idea to get new shoes. The load thing is everyone leaves. His anut and uncle are very mean but,he had reasons. Maxine was funny running on the road."
1,Crazy Lady,"In my opinion Crazy Lady was a HORRIBLE book! The ending was so corny. You would never excpect it but, it doesn't fit."
4,Two Zuni Artists,"Dr. Keith Cunningham's book ""Two Zuni Artists"" is a valuable resource into the life and art of the Zuni culture. The book includes personal interviews with Zuni artisans and insightful information about their ceremonies and culture. Along with the Zuni research, is a story. The story follows the lives of a family of artists and their struggles and accomplishments. The book's subtitle ""A Tale of Art and Mystery"" is definately appropriate, although you must read the book to find out the mystery. Included with the text is a multitude of plates and pictures that depict actual Zuni art and Zuni life. The characters from the story are also pictured in the book. I highly recommend this book to those people who are familiar with Zuni culture and to those who know nothing about it. Overall, a very interesting and insightful book."
4,"great camera, nice features and accessories","i received this camera as a gift and i couldn't be more pleased. the camera has zoom and digital zoom features and a nifty solar panel to help conserve the rechargeable batteries that come with. also included is a nice soft case that has ample room for everything you might want to take with you on an expedition. i have an epson printer and this camera plugs directly into it -- you can print photos without bothering with your computer. of course, since i have photoshop, i have been having a lot of fun turning photos of my dogs, garden, and friends into cd covers, stickers, and inserting photos into letters and email. next step -- my own web site! highly recommended camera outfit."
5,Excellent camera,"I have used this camera for about 3 years now. It takes excellent pictures and is simple to use. It comes with rechargeable batteries, however the charge last for quite a while. I have printed all of the pictures that I have taken, mostly on EPSON paper. With the software, you can ""stitch"" the picturs together to make beautiful Panoramic prints. The only thing that I found that the software cannot do is to take out the ""red eye"", but once downloaded, a picture can be opened on other programs to take out the ""red eye""."
1,Product is good but repair is terrible,"I have an Epson Digital 3000Z camera. The camera was great until it developed a red laser like line across all pictures and displays. I tried to get serviced thru Epson. They DO NOT DEAL with end users, you must take to an ""Authorized Epson Repair Center"". There are three here in Atlanta, and none do repair. All they do is receive, package and ship to Epson for repair.There is a flat [high monetary] repair fee - camera could have been run over by a truck, or missing a screw [high monetary repair fee]!!!! Plus the Authorized Epson Repair Center charges an addtional [monetary fee] to pack and ship. How do you get to be an Authorized Epson Repair Center?Suggestion - if you buy a digital camera, please check out how they repair and where... Would not buy another Epson!!!!"
4,VERY SATISFIED!!!,"This stuff worked extremely well...no irritation, still smooth a week later. I made the mistake of buying NAIR wax because it came in a much,much larger container for about same price, but it was a total waste of money. I have to stock up on the Sally Hansen!"
1,beyond horrified,This stuff is so messy and does NOT remove all the hair. I have wax all over my fingers that wont even come off with the special oil and to top it off I look like I have a Kool Aid mustache. Will never buy this product ever again!
3,Mulcahy PMP exam prep book review,"I actually used both the second and third edition to prepare for the exam. This book helped me in passing the PMP exam, but it certainly was not the self-proclaimed panacea that I had heard about. The formatting and presentation of the book were less than professional, but some of the comments and tricks were right on. I would recommend purchasing the book; however, for the $(...) purchase price I expected better formatting, presentation, and proof-reading."
5,Very helpful in passing the PMP Exam,"I found this book to be filled with helpful hints, relevant examples and lots of practice problems. It helped concentrated my studies on the most appropriate exam areas."
4,Good Buy,"I just took the test and passed. This book is a good buy, but get a couple of others with sample test. The more test practice, the better."
1,Boring,"I made the effort to journey to a theater to see the golly-gee-whiz-honest-to-goodness-3D, only to be disappointed in everything with this movie. The 3D process was wasted on this mess of a movie that was just a lot of computer effects whizzing onto the screen in an blur, coupled with an incomprehensible plot and an ending that was, at best, tacked on in an attempt to make it meaningful. Based on the reviews here, I'm in the minority, because I wasn't awe-struck with Tron: Legacy, and I certainly don't feel the need to own it, or even watch it again on DVD either.The best review of this movie was this sentence by critic Bret Fetzer who wrote: ""For all the techno-babble and quasi-philosophy the characters spout, this is a movie without an idea in its shiny head."" He praised it in other areas, but I liked that comment. Ditto for me and it was a bore-fest as well."
3,"Warning, majority of the film shot in 2D!","I like the movie and think it deserves 4 starts but the extra money to include the 3D version is not worth it. The vast majority of the film looks like 2D. There is in fact a disclaimer on the 3D version. Save your money and get the 2D version.Overall the film is fun. IMO, Bridges is the star of the show and has some really great scenes. I wasn't too thrilled with the ending but overall this film is easy on the eyes and ears and kids are going to love it."
3,Not as good as it could have been,"Overall the movie was ok, but it could have been better. Not surprisingly it was strongly influenced by the original which is fine, but the parts it did add seemed lackluster. The goofy nightclub scene nothing and some of the other new concepts in the movie (like the new race of programs) were glossed over.Its not bad, but its not great."
4,Amazing Special Effects,"Although the storyline does have its rather slow moments, the action scenes are amazing. It may be worth trying to watch the original Tron to catch up on the story, as this movie references scenes from the original. Definitely worth watching."
2,Disappointing,Giving it two stars just for the special effects. Usually I criticize movies for not having enough plot. This one actually spends too much time trying to explain it. And much of that is just nonsensical techno jibberish type stuff. What's the point? Would have liked more running and chasing like the original Tron. Could have been really fun with the updated special effects. Actually starts out promising then turns into more of a drama. Maybe they thought with an actor as good as Jeff Bridges that was the direction to take. Big mistake.
2,owner,"Its a good deal but I was disappointed in the 3d part. This movie has both 2d and 3d parts. It stated it in the beginning. I did not see it in the theater so I cant compare but The 3d parts were hardly worth it.I would not recommend it. the regular blu ray would be fine with me. I am still waiting to see if avatar shows the same as in the theater. Tron , not the best 3d movie but hell I bought the tv so Im not gonna watch a movie thats in 3d in regular 2d. thats dumb.thats my opinion."
3,"Not bad, not great...just...","This was really an average effort IMO. The idea of Tron is cool, and some of the CG effects were very impressive. Really though, the story itself was pretty average. That, and the main antagonist, who is supposed to be lacking in emotion actually has quite a bit of it in a wooden way. Kind of a glaring story flaw. Overall, it is just like watching somebody playing a video game with just a bit too much emphasis on a shaky plot.It wasnt horrible, but really wasnt special. Worth a rental, but no chance i would ever buy the discs (no pun intended)."
2,almost but missed the boat,"I wanted to like this movie, but I don't. The Blu-Ray was very clear and at some times even a bit visually stunning... but the 7.1 DTS sounded terrible on my 5.1 sound system... and I can't stand techno-disco crap for music, so I was very put off by the sound... at times so loud that it drowns out the dialogue track so I had to use the sub-titles to even know where the story was going... which as it turns out wasn't very far at all! The original at least had ""bits"" of humor spread out, but this story didn't. Largely a disappointing evening to be had for all... I was expecting so much more."
4,Great Movie,"Great movie---visually appealing, entertaining, and it has heart. It is not necessary to have seen the first Tron in order to appreciate this one. I still haven't seen Tron: the Classic, but I've seen Tron: Legacy more than once and have sincerely enjoyed it. As anticipated, this movie translates well to Blu-ray, although it looks very nice on DVD as well, in my opinion. The Blu-ray has the usual bells and whistles, such as the scene tracker at the bottom of your screen when you fast forward or rewind the movie. It also has something called Disney Second Screen, which I have not attempted to use.My one complaint about this Blu-ray is the audio track, which at certain points in the film is very low. During the action scenes, the volume seemed to be about normal, but in some of the quieter dialogue I had to adjust my volume quite a bit."
4,Don't upgrade to 3D if you already have in BluRay,"I have enjoyed this movie in DVD and when it came out in BluRay 3D I decided that I would give it a try on my Panasonic 3D TV. I was so disappointed. The 3D was barely noticeable. I had assumed that it would be impressive given the amount of generated landscapes. I was wrong. The BluRay version looks great. 3d, not so much."
2,Seller Excellent but 3D quality of Movie Poor,Seller was excellent...received item on time and company great to work with with order from GreyWhale again in a heart beat. I really like this movie but you can hardly tell any difference between the 2D and 3D version...which is DAD because this movie would have been great if filmed/shot in real 3D versus converted from 2D. No depth to the 3D in this movie. Don't waste your monie buy a used 2D DVD version for about $5 including shipping.
2,"Gotta say, It stunk!","I was looking forward to this as I always enjoyed the original as a cult favorite, but this just really didn't catch my interest. I'm sorry that I spent the money to rent it."
3,a good film but better exists this is a 3.5,"Definitely not the best movie to come out in years. I will rewatch the original and this one again but this is a cult film and those who like it ""really really like it"". You can conjure images of this as a ground breaking film but your perception is clouded by the the beauty of its music since some five ratings feel that 60-75% of the film is its music, so. Buy the CD or download. With a decent film you should be able to respect it with the volume off. There are way to many decent and very good films produced in the last five years to get stuck on this one. A second point is Alice in Wonderland and Avatar are recent movie. This might be the best movie that has come out last year but Inception was very good also. So thank you for your positive review but this is a 3.5 to 4 star film that runs a little slow at times but is worth a second or third watch maybe for now. It left me a little lacking like it was missing something."
2,ONLY IF YOUR A BIG FAN,Ok first the good stuff great sound good 3d and if your a Tron fan you will probably enjoy it.For the rest of us the movie is dark all the way through there is no in your face 3d to speak of story line will put you to sleep wait for 2hours and then your treated to one good scene I wont tell you and ruin it I would recomend it only if your a big fan.
2,"great visuals, decent story and characters","Tron legacy was a very hyped movie. my expectations were soooo high, and when i finally saw it, it ended being just a good B movie/action flick. i was turned off by so many things, like: the story wasnt exciting or engaging and the characters felt a bit dull (maybe because the not so good dialogue/script). after seeing the movie the first time i really disliked it, but when i saw it the second time i knew what to expect. i liked it the second time around, it was a movie with amazing visuals. dont mistake it for a masterpiece (not even close), its simply a visually fun movie. surprisingly the characters grew on me. buy it on bluray for stunning visuals. I have to admit though, the movie lacks thrill and interest half way into the movie. It's not a movie i would be willing to buy or watch frequently."
2,Tron 3D,I was very disappointed with this movie. The 3d was not that good and this plot was boring to say the least. It was a waste of my time to watch this and my company was not impressed to say the least.
3,Tron in 3D,"We found the movie to be ok in normal veiw, however, we were somewhat disapointed in the 3D production. I didn't realize they were going to do a partial 3D production. I really thought something was wrong with my equipment as this was 2nd showing on our new 3D Samsung TV. Since thin, we have watch several other 3D movies and they were excellent. The 3D portion of the movie was very good."
4,Digital Mad Max,We just bought a 3d tv and aquired this to try it out . It was ok . Not all scenes are 3d but it is seamless . Movie was at times hard to follow but I am getting older . If you haven't seen it and its been out forever give it a whirl on uniqueness . Sort of like a digital mad max movie . Sci Fi fans will feel at home in this futuristic journey into a digital existance .
5,Family loves the movie,"Not going to review the movie because we all know what it's about. My kids (5 & 7) watch it over and over. Great looking bluray. Thought about getting the original too since my kids love this movie so much but I have a feeling the special effects of the first would not ""wow"" them and it might be on the slow side for them. Tron: Legacy has a nice pace with great special effects."
3,OK movie,We like this movie. However to have to review every movie we rent from Amazon is a pain! The stars should be enough.They are for Netflix. I'm not a movie critic.
3,3-D version not worth it. Buy blu-ray instead.,"This movie was not the best movie in the world, but it wasn't bad either. Definitely worth watching once or twice. And it's clean, which is hard to find these days, so that is a very nice bonus.My main focus on this review is the 3-D effects of the movie, which weren't good. It wasn't much different than a blu-ray version, and to be completely honest, if the two were playing side by side it would be hard to tell the difference. Do not buy the 3-D version. Save your money and buy the blu-ray instead."
2,decent,Decent movie good details during the game starts but ends way to fast. not alot of action. Which for this movie i would have like to see more action. It is a decent remake but they could have done better. i wanted more and expected more
3,"interesting, but it's a retread of the first one","When I saw this in the theatre I was expecting a quality Disney produt, but it was the worst 3D I have ever seen. It was like cardboard cutouts: no layers. The story wasn't too bad, but the flim was just updated special effects from the first, better, movie. When the DVD arrived, the Blue Ray disc would not only NOT play, but it caused my new player to shut down! Disney couldn't find a problem so Amazon gave us a refund."
2,A little over hyped...,"Alright so 20 years and that's all they came up with? Anyways the story seemed lacking, spent too much time making everything look pretty all in lights. The 3D effects also were like a 6/10 nothing really flew off the screen at me, you'd think with all those discs flying everywhere one would make it off the screen...but no. There were a few parts where you could really feel the some depth however. I would strongly suggest they not use the 3D as a strong selling point. As for the thing switching between letterbox and 16:9 really wasn't needed and it lessened the 3D effects, and also at times seemed to just happen randomly. Overall it wasn't horrible but really not worth running out to own, there were a few highlights such as Olivia Wild in something you could paint on. The best way to get through it is just think of it as a 2 hour Daft Punk music Video...I probably wouldn't of been so cruel had it not been blown up with ads and hype."
2,What 3D-VERY VERY Disappointing,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie in the theather which is why I decided to purchase this movie. I recently purchased a 3D TV & 3D Sony BD player and thought this would be a great movie to try out my new equipment, ""WRONG"". I thought my TV was malfuctioning; apparently the extreme majority of the movie was shot in 2D, save your money and buy the BluRay version. The cover jacket is more 3D than the movie."
2,Matrix-lite,"This is Matrix-lite, built on the flaws of the two Matrix sequels. The rules are made up as the story goes. Sure, it's science-fiction, but the story should at least make sense. All flash with very little substance--highly disappointing."
2,One Long Boring Movie and Hard to Follow,I thought the 1st movie was boring and this update was not worth the time to watch. It was way to fast paced and plots were hard to follow. The acting was just as bad & they mumbled a lot and I found my self needing to do a replay just to understand what they are saying. If you are a collector buy it if not then just rent it This movie get 2 stars and no more. Sorry I really was hoping it have some better plots and would be more understandable.
5,Amazing Sequel!,"Tron Legacy was everything and more than what I was expecting as a sequel!Great soundtrack, great acting and stunning effects courtsey of Disney!Story was a little weaker than what I wanted but I still enjoyed myself and hope to see more films just like this in the near future!The 3-D was amazing and worth the extra fee to see this."
1,This movie was not impressive,"First off I was really excited to see this movie but after renting it and watching it I was sleeping throughout the whole time, yeah this is how awful and boring this movie is. The 1st Tron was no prize either, this one was worse it was like watching video games for 2 hours. If you want to see great sci-fi action then check out the 2009 verstion of Star Trek and Avatar."
1,Shameful Sequel,"I am a HUGE fan of Tron! I remember when I first watched it as a kid and could not get over how amazing the film was, but this new addition is just plain shameful. There was no plot hardly at all; the concept of Flynn being gone for nearly 20 years; okay possible, but come on, the best they could do was that a clone took over and Flynn, being the great `user' could not find a way out other than just doing nothing and spending his time becoming a ""Zen"" master; please! Give me a break! I expected so much more! Not too mention that we don't find out whether or not Tron lives or dies at the end, only that he falls into the water and his suit changes color. They don't even fully explain what it is all about with the Isomorphs and why they came into exsistence to begin with. This movie is just crap and lame and any other word you might wish to use. Don't waste your time on this."
1,Video game with marginal acting.,"Yet another movie aimed at the American audience. In other words, very little plot or character development, but lots of special effects - the perfect movie for Americans.It's difficult to know if Hollywood has run out of good scripts, or if they just cut to the chase, and make new movies as if they were video games - you know, where they can attract the twenty second attention span of the average American."
5,a must buy,I wanted this movie badly but didn't want to spend to much because i don't have space for the show and tell one so Amazon had a sale for bout $20 and i jumped on it shows perfect. Great buy.
2,Not great 3D..............,"I bought this to see on my Samsung 3D tv. I have seen 2 other movies on my tv, imax deep sea and drive angry. This is horrible!!! I was shocked because I love the movie in regular format. The first problem is that as the movie goes, it changes screen size and from 2D to 3D which is very annoying. The 3D doesnt come out like it should, its more of a deep 3D which I can make anything on my Samsung tv do that. Don't waste your money on this one, hopefully I will get a descent trade in value."
5,Tron,I enjoyed this flim. It has many creative events with hot action warriors. The villian was the loser. This made my day.
2,"A little neon & black-lighting doth not a good film, make...","I see why this film tanked in the theaters. It's a very empty vessel. It's worth the $1.99 I paid for a 48hr rental, but not more. Hollywood screws up another potentially great sequel w/the cheapo approach. I'm not surprised."
3,Poor 3-D conversion,"The storyline like substance, the visuals are okay, but if you're buying it for the 3-D; most of the Scenes are not converted, defeating the purpose. If you compare to other 3-D new releases, this fall short completely. I have a Samsung that converts 2-D to 3-D, use that in addition and you'll be ok."
5,TRON LEGACY(2010),"I have yet to see the First Tron(Original) I didn't care much for the movie or trailer when first announced as I thought it's not my type,but I went to go see in 3-D and I must say It's not the Greatest Movie ever but it's pretty good and the Music(Daft Punk who I like alot of their songs and I was not a Fan before but now I am) is Excellent which made the movie even better.The Soundtrack is great and I think it's what makes the movie but that's my opinion."
2,didn't remember,"saw this movie back in the 80's and thought it was cool, got both versions to watch and compare. however, re-watching it as 'adults' didn't find the original as entertaining as we once did and the ending just leaves you hanging. can't say that the 'new' one impressed us either. we care for younger children and they enjoyed them."
4,Great sequel to a classic movie,"I remember watching the original Tron and being amazed at the visuals. This time around I was better prepared and still found the visuals stunning. The story was good, although there were a few strange plot holes, the story was nonetheless enjoyable. On my 50"" plasma the colors really popped and the special effects were great. The special features were okay, but there wasn't a lot to look at there. My only criticism is that I buy discs in part for the special features and not getting much is a bit of a letdown. Otherwise, it was a good buy for me."
3,Great movie; bad downloadable version,"We love this movie! My son watches it all the time. After the DVD got scratched, I decided to buy the digital version so he couldn't scratch the disk again. I am so disappointed.The volume is ridiculous. In order to have it loud enough to hear the dialog, there is a buzzing sound in the background. It also makes the sound effects louder than I would like. I'll probably end up buying it on disc again.Buy the DVD or Blu-Ray for a great movie experience. Avoid the downloadable version!Movie: 5 stars. Version: 1 star."
4,"Same Formula, Same Results","i own the original movie remastered, collector's-20year anniversary edition and all that crap, this is a great movie and Tron:Legacy i believe is even better."
4,Looks Amazing...but sadly lacks extras,"The blu-ray version of Tron Legacy looks amazing and I'd still buy the disc for the movie alone. However, if, like me, you also buy blu-rays and DVD's for the extras, you'll be disappointed with this one. Unlike the original Tron DVD/Blu-ray, the extras here are sadly lacking. There's perhaps an hour (max) of extras - if you want more, you'll have to download an app to your iPad or PC and run it simultaneously while the movie runs in your player.Really? To me, that's cheap. Many other movies (including Disney's Pixar releases) include picture-in-picture and branching extras but apparently they couldn't be bothered to do this with Tron Legacy. My only hope is that they used the disc space they saved on the extras and used it to provide the best possible image quality on the movie instead.So I give this 5 stars for the movie and 3 for the cheap extras."
4,Effects are Awesome!,Movie storyline is not easy for children to understand but the visual effects are awesome for 3d home video...a must see!
3,Special Effects,"I thought the 3D special effects were cool, but the storyline was a little off. Jeff Bridges gives a good performance as do the other two main actors/actress. I was kind of hoping the outside world would have more of an ongoing impact on the grid, like the corporate big shots find out about the grid and try to exploit it. This never happened."
5,Tron: Legacy,"This Tron is a good Tron. I am a bit of a fan of the original tron. The original Tron had/has a younger jeff bridges in it. This Tron: Legacy has an older jeff Bridges. I am a person that bases movies on their original counterparts. I really like to older Tron. The newer Tron: Legacy is pretty good, but I am conparing it to the older Tron. I really can not do that since each movie has its own guidelines to go by. Tron was an original, Tron: Legancy is a Tron of the future - Tron. SO, each has it's own point of interest going for it. I would say. Stop here with the Trons."
4,Its not the Tron you would expect,"Okay, here is the deal. That digital Jeff Bridges was a masterpiece. My own family believes CLU was a real person. Can you say clueless? The movie is short and and the CGI is overblown. The best part of this movie is believing you can digitalize yourself."
3,So glad I didn't see this in theatre,"The narrative is incoherent, the performances are either strangely muted or annoyingly manic, and Garrett Hedlund cannot act AT ALL. The original was a kitschy classic, but this one's just a dud, despite the new and improved effects."
1,Not so Hot!,"sometimes the disc would load, most of the time it would not, it jamed the machine and I had to unplug the player to get it to re set, other 3D titles played fine so there was something wrong with this disc.On one attempt it did load but there was no 3D effects, we went through the entire movie, the tv stayed in 3D mode and activated the 3D glasses but there was no 3D effect...... something clearly wrong so I sent it back, Amazon is a great company and as such they were great taking the defective title back, I did not re-order another of the same movie.I also had purchased the 3D TV and dvd player from Amazon at a great price as always."
1,failure,disney absolutely fails at life i recieved the tron 2 disc bluray and dvd combo for easter and put in the code to transfer the movie and magically nothing happened i call disney call back later. and people wonder why people pirate movies
1,Lousy,This was a waste of money. It wasn't anything like I thought it would be. Kind of dumb and very un-interesting.
4,Husband liked it,My husband liked it so much that he watched it twice. As for myself.......Not so much. This was just not my kind of movie. Hope this review helps.
2,BEAUTIFUL EMPTINESS,"TRON LEGACY is certainly a stylish beautiful movie--so are many video games. But TRON LEGACY has about as much substance as cotton candy. We've seen the plot all too many times--good guy goes bad, turns into a megalomaniac wanting to take over the world. The acting is merely posturing and programmed. I just didn't get into it!"
5,Great Blu-Ray,"If you loved the original Tron movie, you'll love this movie. If you never saw the original Tron movie, this is still a great movie. Great visuals, great music! Best to own on Blu-Ray with a good entertainment system (with lots of Bass). Turn it up LOUD and enjoy!"
5,Great Tron Sequel,"I watched the original Tron when I was a kid.The sequel is actually following its tradition with a twist.Really recommended for it's fx, something that hasn't seen before not even in the original Tron (because its really old, but innovative in its time)The plot could of been more complex, but is entertaining.Any Tron fans out there, I think you won't be dissapointed."
4,I like this movie,A lot of people hate this movie. I am not one of those people. I actually enjoyed this movie. I thought it was a faithful extension of the original and the special effects were great.The 3D is very tasteful. I.e. no obvious gimmicks with characters through things towards the camera to get a reaction from the audience.If you like the original movie or are simply a fan if Sci-Fi you should enjoy this movie.
2,3D Rating only,"I try to write reviews for people who are wanting to get 3d blu-rays, but are scared of wasting the money on a movie that has no 3d effect. I have a panasonic 55 inch gt 600 hz 3d plasma with a 600hz 3d rated Monster hdmi cable. This rating is strictly for the 3d quality only. At the very begining there is a message that tells you this film was not intended for 3 d but convert to 3 d(only a few scenes are 3d). The 3 d quality on the certain scenes are good however, the rest of the film is a big disappointment. In my honest opinion I would not have purchased it."
4,"Beautiful visuals and CGI, don't expect much of a story","Blu-Ray is definitely the medium of choice for this movie. the visuals and eye-candy in the movie more than make up for a hair-thin story. If you are a TRON fan, watch this. If you have no idea what TRON was, this movie may not make sense to you but watch it just the same. Loved the new light cycles and the overall feel of the visuals. The Daft Punk music score is another awesome highlight."
3,Visually stunning with a good soundtrack,"The highlight of Tron: Legacy (2010) is the soundtrack by Daft Punk. It's the main reason to watch this movie, in my opinion. This movie's visually stunning special effects take center stage. The movie can be hard to follow at first, but I think multiple viewings will help if you didn't fully understand the story the first time around. This movie is a sequel to the original Tron (1982). Both movies have state-of-the-art special effects for the time periods they were released.Usually one can expect wooden acting in a high tech science fiction movie of this type, but the acting, though a little wooden at times, is not bad overall. Jeff Bridges was made to look much younger (through computer enhancement) in this movie than he actually is.Overall, a pretty good movie that I recommend."
2,Great Music Score,This movie is so boring. There is not much drama in this movie. There is no philosophical value. It is very different from the original. I see this movie as an action flick but this movie has too much talking that makes no sense IMO. I do like the visual. Visual is very good. I also love the score. I am going to get the sound track.2 stars
3,Annoying Sound and Aspect Ratio,"As good as this movie was in the movie theater, it does not come across on DVD as well. The aspect ratio keeps shifting from one size to another and the music soundtrack volume goes in and out through out the movie. In the Sam fights Rinzler in the disc wars the soundtrack in the theaters was cranked up high but on the DVD it is softly in the background taking away from the scene. I am a bit annoyed with what they have done on the DVD. I do not have a high def tv but I do have surround sound system yet this should not make a difference with the ever changing aspect ration and the sound. The inconsistencies make it hard to really enjoy the movie on dvd. The picture isn't as clear as I thought it would be as well. I hope the blueray copy is better than this. A bit disappointed as the music soundtrack was the strongpoint of this film"
3,it plays and has some 3D effects,"If you like the 3D like I do the stuff that comes out of the screen then get this in regular 2 D its cheaper that way, This has a mixture of 2D with 3D this is another one of them depth perception 3D movies but only while he is in the ""Game"" My reasoning for the 3 Stars is because of the type of 3D effects which are very limited"
3,"Great graphics, sleeper story line.","The movie in regards to graphics was great, the actors were as good as expected but the story left me asleep at the wheel."
2,Tron 3D Review,Not alot of really good 3D technology associated with this release. Shouldn't have been sold as such with the poor quality and very few scenes that had any 3D in them
3,Tron Legacy,"let's say I've expected more of the film, but on the other hand, it was very well done, I like the directors choice in actors for the movie :) Olivia Wild was hot ! ;)"
5,And the legend continues!,A great follow-up for one of the all time greats! Tron stimulated the mind in a way that was exciting and somehow put you right there with the players. Tron: Legacy brings back that excitement and builds the story from the beginning to a thrilling climax. Bruce Boxleitner and Jeff Bridges are the inventors and players in both movies.
3,Crappy 3D,The sound was great but the 3D was not very good as is the case with most of the home 3D movies I have seen. The movie companies better start doing a better job or home 3d won't be around very long.
3,Dazzling,This film was an amazing experience in IMAX 3-D. Not sure how the visuals will translate to a smaller flat screen. But if you love sci-fi flavored eye candy there is plenty to savor here.
3,Avatar Curse with Zero Creativity,"Avatar curse is upon whole world now in form of Tron .its Blue all over again but this movie is not great for its visuals but for exploring a loving relationship between father and son .I felt like watching finding Nemo in reverse (This movie is also PG not PG13 ) as here its son trying to save dad.Team behind Tron tried so hard to stick to original movie that they ignored to introduce anything new for this version .Almost 80% action sequence in movie are exact replica of original but of course high tech and big budget.so its like 1982 Tron in 3D with zero Creativity.All close Fight sequences were boring actors just throwing shields.They could `ve introduced some new high tech toys .Sam character was left unexplored in real world .Sound track is awesome but weak 3D unable to immerse ""user ""in the whole experience .So far only movie that really I want to play on my samsung 3D (regardless of story/acting) is ""Resident evil after life"""
1,HATED IT,I watched this for about 10-15 minutes and turned it off. The narrative flow was irritating and broke the flow of the tale. I'm not really sorry I didn't stick around for the special effects as I expect a minimum story quality to the movie. Fail. WHEN WATCHED: today; MY GRADE: D plus to C minus.
4,Love it,"Jeff Bridges is awesome. The movie wasnt as good as the first one, but still very good. Im sure Ill watch it again."
5,Wow!,"This is not a great film, and I must confess, I was not a fan of the original. But it truly is one of the COOLEST science-fiction movies of all time (the music, the costumes, the amazing looking world). It should appeal to most sci-fi fans. If you like it, I recommend you also check-out the cartoon on the Disney Channel (TRON: Uprising).Ironically, I felt similarly about it's video game (TRON: Evolution). It's not a great game -- but it's super-cool!"
3,3D Review by a 3D Connoisseur,"My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.If you like out of screen effects, this movie is NOT for you. After 23 minutes of 2D, the 3D portion started. About an hour went by and I still could not say there was even one small OOS effect. Near the end of the movie there were a few 5% to 10%ers and 1 at almost 25% of the way from the screen to the viewer. The in-screen 3D seemed lackluster with a somewhat shallow depth field however the 3D that was there had very few flaws.*** OK In-Screen 3D BUT Lacked OOS Effects ***MY 3D RATING = GOOD (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.Click on `See all my reviews' for the lowdown on other 3Ds"
1,Dont waste your money buying the 3D version,As soon as the movie starts a disclaimer appears on the screen saying most of the movie in 2D. There were some 3D scenes but not worth the extra cost. Love the movie and thought the 3d version would be mind blowing but it was not.
2,Tea: All flash and bang but no depth in flavor.,"Overall not as good as I hoped. And the only reason I made it through was because there was nothing better to watch.The story picks up hooking the first movie, and introducing us to Jack's (Jeff Bridges) son, who has grown up without a dad, and has become a rebellious youth.The visual effects were fantastic. The story was incredibly lacking in plot, characters, and theme development. It wasn't believable . I wasn't drawn in. I wasn't hooked.The original was a lot better, in the story, characters, and theme.I would not buy this for my collection."
5,Classic A++,This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time. Definitely on my top ten list. Highly recommended.
2,Slow and disappointing,"Even with the modern special effects, the movies still has that 1980's feel. Maybe that was intentional. The plot is slow to develop and kind of limps along to the predictable ending. It's kind of an empty film: lots of special effects but little of substance to actually draw you in.Not recommended."
2,"must be a ""tronster"" to enjoy it","I purchased this for my 10 year old son because he liked the concept of ""going into the game."" While the cinematography was good, the story line did not hold the attention of my son, myself or my sci-fi loving husband. My daughter's comment was that is was a ""sad story."" Not impressed."
5,LIKE A GOOD OLD CLASSIC RENOVATED,UNTIL NOW I AM SEEING 7 TIMES THIS PICTURE LIKE ITS PREDECESSOR. I LOVE THE VIEW OF AN ADVENTURE INSIDE THE COMPUTERS (LIKE MATRIX TRILOGY) THANKS TO THE PRODUCER IN ORDER TO CONTUNE THE SAGA (I BELIVE ITS DISNEY)
2,"great movie, horrible dvd","ok, this movie is great! i really like it and i bought it shortly after it came out. but the dvd is horrible. after only using it a few times it started skipping and not letting me use the scene select button and now it won't play at all. i do not recommend buying the single disk Tron."
4,TRON II PAVE THE WAY FOR THREE,"LETS GET THE NEGATIVE OUT OF THE WAY FIRST. THE MOVIE ASSUMES THE VIEWER HAS SEEN AND REMEMBERS THE FIRST TRON, MAKING IT A LITTLE LESS intresting for the younger audience. But, they are more than compensated with the high speed racing and other super graphics. What the CPU erases it can restore too. So a third TRON is more than possible. How much do they have to make to make it worth their while?"
4,"Good Movie, Bad Choices","The movie was good, I enjoyed it. But I'm pretty annoyed at only having the option (that I could find) to buy the Blu-Ray / DVD combo. I really just want the basic Blu-Ray, nothing else, for a basic price. This combo packaging sucks."
4,Tron Legacy Shipping and Product Review,"I pre-ordered this item and got it a day before the actual release date! It was in perfect condition, still wrapped in the plastic. A great family movie, hardly a foul word is spoken and a good message of fatherly love. The BEST part of the movie is the MUSIC! A great sci-fi movie with incredible visual effects."
2,Disappointing,"Tron is a favorite of mine. Tron Legacy is a disappointment, and waaay to derivative. The threats are the same (rogue program). The games and many scenes are derived from the original movie, but the games lack imagination the second time around. All the bad guys are eliminated, but instead of the game ending, more bad guys appear. And Flynn's off the grid living quarters, and sound effects, are right out of the last scene of 2001, where Keir Dullea is on Jupiter (or wherever it was he landed). Michael Sheen does a good job, as usual. The sound's not bad, and the visual composition of the fights is good, but the writing is disappointing."
2,Boring and silly,"I loved seeing Jeff Bridges and Bruce, but this was long and boring. And why one of the characters was suppose to be so important was never fully explained. Nice setup, but then it just died."
5,LOVE IT,"I cant say enough about this. Just let your mind go and get sucked into the grid and enjoy the movie, and the vusiauls it provides."
2,TRON 3D,"Week story. Too much bad special effects, especially 3D. I suggest you watch or rewatch the origanal TRON before watching the new 3D TRON."
5,Loved this movie when I saw it at the Theater...now I own it!,An excellent sequel to the original film & with all the bells and whistles that new technology can provide! A must have for any Sci-Fi lover and Action aficionado! Olivia Wilde is a beautiful woman that adds to the allure of this movie!
4,Review of BluRay Tron,The movie Tron is a great movie and there was no problems with the quality of the movie. The box to the movie did sustain damage sometime before arrival to my house as the inside tabs that hold both the DVD and the Blu Ray were broken so that the DVD and Blu Ray disc were bouncing around inside the box.
4,Looks great and sounds great....,"So truthfully, I'm not crazy about this movie. Saw it in the theater and didn't like it, but I like the first one quite a bit. I bought it strictly because it's a 3D release.As far as visuals, it's a crystal clear looking 3D movie. Stuff definitely doesn't pop out at you, it's more depth that you will experience. The sound is my favorite part of the release. It sounds awesome.Legends of the Guardians rocks it as fars as 3D goes, if you are looking for something specifically for 3D."
3,Tron graphics good Story eh,"The graphics are insane and as a Tron fan I looked forward to this movie. Story line dragged out however and if it wasn't for the graphics I would probably have fallen asleep. I like movies that I can watch over and over again. This is not one of them. Maybe in 3-5 years, I will pick it up again."
5,This movie is sweet!,"I know there are some negative reviews about this movie but I don't get it...it's visually stunning, the story is good and the acting is solid. A great follow-up to the original."
3,GOOD,"MADE ME THINK. THE COMPUTER LIFE,WE ALL MAY BE IN THAT WORLD, THEN WE CAN DO EVERYTHING, THAT'S ALL FOR NOW."
2,Short on 3D,"The movie is good, I've seen it once before, but wanted to actually own it since I liked it. I recently purchased a 3D Blue Ray player and wanted a few more 3D movies. I was disappointed that there was very few 3D effects and some if not most scenes didn't have any 3D effects. If you are looking for a nice 3D movie, this is not the one for you."
4,Tron Legacy is Worth Seeing,"OK, I probably missed this but, I thought that Flynn escaped in the first movie? Well, either way....still a good movie. My only issue.....Flynn Sr. gets a little cheezy. He says things like ""Digital Jazz, man!"" So much for the coolness factor.Special effects: 10 out of 10Plot: 9 out of 10 - The ending was a little weak - still good thoughActing: 8 out of 10 - Sometimes the acting was not that believable ""digital jazz"" etc.Overall, it was a good movie but they should have spent a bit more time on the ending. I can't imagine they put lines like ""digital jazz, man"" in by accident so, it's just not my taste....didn't seem believable from a guy that was ""cool"" in the 80's....but then again look at Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley....they would say it....give me a break. ha ha ha!Worth Renting (which is what I did)"
2,Worst 3D i've ever seen!!!!!,"The movie itself is not bad, but i bought a Blu-Ray 3D thinking that i was really going to enjoy it. Well at the begining of the movie you get ""Several scenes of the movies were shot in 2D"" That was an understatement!!!! I didn't really see anything on 3D and i kept my glasses on the entire movie.If you are interest in buying the 3D version of this movie, please don't, just buy the regular Blu-Ray and you will be getting the same dvd. I gave it 2 stars because the movie is not that bad, but they should not claim is 3D when not even 10% of the movie was shot in 3D."
2,Not as good as I'd heard,"I had heard a lot about this movie, and was quite excited when I saw it go on sale, so I picked it up, and wish I hadn't. The special effects are beautiful (hence not giving it a 1 star rating) but the plot is so boring. Acting is great, and really everything about the movie was fine, but I found myself having a difficult time staying focused on the movie, and my family, with whom I was watching with, felt the same way. None of us had seen the original film from the '80s, but we were told it wasn't necessary and that we'd ""Catch right on."" There must've been something in the original we needed to know, because now we have another blu-ray sitting on the shelf that will never be watched again. At least I purchased it on sale..."
2,An anti-Nazi story? really?,"Putting the plot aside, I would say this movie is a mediocre Hollywood special effects movie.I wanted desperately to see the original after watching this just to remember what 'color' was.Here's the thing:1. You are inside the computer/net! really? didn't see much in there. Few if any references to RAM, bits, CPUs, Facebook, email, etc. Computer games? yes, only what we have seen before in the original Tron.2. You are inside the computer/net: You can make a movie with no bounds. You can change gravity, you can do anything! Friggin World of Warcraft is more intersting than this monochrome city with dark clouds above it!3. Go rent the orginal and use these discs to put drinks on."
3,5 stars go to the soundtrack...,"Unfortunately the soundtrack is the only part of the movie that gets 5 stars. The story, far too reminiscent of The Matrix (without the gritty violence and a squeaky clean backdrop), also has a major religious context that just weighs down the entire movie in 2 star pretentiousness. And the 5 star soundtrack? Weakened by ""family friendly"" violence that just seems nowhere near as epic as the music backing it. The overall most solid way to enjoy the movie is for the visuals, and even there we have some major cases of blue screen disbelief, and Clu's mouth (someone knows what I'm talking about!).Buy the soundtrack. It's the best part of the experience."
3,A disappointment,"What a disappointment. Uneven story line. The original Tron was far better. This re-make is a solid two and a half stars, but that's not an allowable choice, so I ended up rounding upwards to three stars. Okay to rent, but not worth buying; save your money."
5,Very Euro-style,"I loved it, had a very euro-techno style and for that reason it will tank here in the states. In 20 years time this will be another cult classic in the vein of blade runner.A brit in the US"
1,Disney Bluray issues,EVERY time I have purchased a Disney Bluray I have had issues with the firmware on my player. I can and have purchased Blurays from other studios and VERY rarely had a problem. Disney every damn time! Enough. I will no longer purchase Disney Bluray product. A shame as I like many of thier films.
1,Amazon shame on you,"Great video until one of the 27 warning screens comes up saying ""NOT FOR RESALE"". Yes 27 times during the movie. congratulations Amazon, you got over on me."
5,Wow,"I liked this movie and so would you. It is based on a true story of CNN heroes who are and decide to stay in Iraq during the Gulf War despite the so many risks. Their brave hearts make them the envy of every journalist from all over the world as this CNN crew is the only one that covered Gulf War - LIVE.Michael Keaton rocks in this movie. I liked his performance here more then in the famous Batman movie or any other he played before.I would especially and highly recommend this movie to those people who burned their own flags that represent Justice and Democracy for a scumbag such as Sadam Hussein and its loyal followers which today thanks to U.S.A are the sorest losers as they have always been. Then you'll see how ""smart"" you were to burn your own flag for someone who is a menace to the civilised world.A must watch movie. Well done to all the people who made this great movie. Well done to CNN heroes too. CNN rocks - as always."
2,Not A Good Camera,"I wish people wouldn't write good reviews about this camera. For the amount this camera is, you can do a lot better. I love the video feature, but taking pictures indoors is horrible. The flash is not very good and the pictures come out dark. And don't even try to take pictures without the flash because they are going to come out extremely blurry. You have to have a very steady hand if you want the pictures to come out good, and that's if the subjects aren't moving. I have tried the various scene modes in the camera, and it still doesn't do anything, infact, if you use the indoor portrait mode and you take pictures with the flash on, they are still blurry. I would go with a Sony if you want bright pictures. I'm thinking of buying one and selling this one."
4,"Nifty camera but go with the V550, not the 530...","...because the LCD screen on the 550 is magnificent. The camera itself is about the size of a deck of cards and the screen fills much of that space. Easy to scroll thru the menu for the gazillions of options. Yes, you need a steady hand when not using the flash; however, I disagree that the pictures are dark. When you download thru Easyshare software and edit a picture, just choose 'enhance' if it seems dark and the result will be excellent. Also, the video is sharp...and it's helpful to have such an inconspicuous video camera. If you keep the camera charged on the dock I don't think a second battery is needed, either. Overall, just a great, fun camera that provides excellent results."
4,Wonderful camera,"God, I love this thing. It's nice, small, versatile, has all kinds of bells and whistles, and is teensy. I just wish I'd waited to get the dual-lens model.The camera takes bright, sharp pictures, fits in a shirt or jeans pockets, and offers an amazing array of options for any camera geek. I reccomend getting an extra battery, though, because with the bigger SD cards you can run out pretty fast."
2,I wouldn't recommned.,"I bought this camera yesterday and I'm 90% sure I am returning it tomorrow.The indoor picture quality is not what I was expecting. I tested out a few pictures of my pets, they didn't seem so bad, but when I tested it out on people...they were awful. They looked like the picture quality of the basic kodak digital camera. If someone had glasses, the light would reflect off of them everytime. Outdoor pictures are good, but you can't always go outside for every picture you take!"
2,good for outdoor shots,"This is a great little camera if you do a lot of outdoor photo shoots of still objects. I have 3 small children, and it doesn't work too well for my photo needs. I take lots of indoor pictures which most of the time turn out pretty dark unless I have it super bright in my house, but that isn't very often. I tried to take pictures at my son's kindergarten graduation in his classroom, but it was too dark to get even one shot. I had to get video of him to be able to see him at all. Not so great for kids in motion either, they are blurry.Video option is great though. I guess I use this option most on my camera. I have had this one about a year, and I am going for a canon with IS (image stabalization) now. I will retire this camera to my husband."
1,Poor Design and Even Poorer Customer Service,"LOVED this camera until it broke one year later. I mean it completely broke. It's dead. The battery power died during a photo shoot and killed the camera. Now it won't even turn on. See my post in the forum on this page for more info. The short of it all is, do NOT buy Kodak. My GF has a Canon Elph and it's far more amazing than anything Kodak makes. Plus if you ever have to deal with Kodak's customer service...well, let's hope you never have to."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"Barnum would have loved this book as he relished the idea that a sucker is born every minute. I wasted both time and money on this book. If you want a far more credible model of management, get the book Beyond the Hype. For serious stories of leadership read and learn from The Working Leader. For serious exposition of complexity theory and business, buy Ralph Stacey's books."
4,"Logical layout, engaging reading","I have used this textbook in my Lifespan Development classes at Ivy Tech State College, Bloomington, IN, for 2 years now. The students and I have found it very readable, logically arranged, and quite well-done overall. I would recommend it to other college instructors. My students, mainly nursing majors, have found it to be a good overview of the issues they are likely to encounter when dealing with their future patients in healthcare settings."
3,"Good layout & idea, bad implementation.","The board's layout was fantastic and setup was a breeze. the IDE port & the cmos jumper were located perfectly on the board.The nVidia SATA raid controller was not compatible with my Maxtor Maxline 500 SATA2 HDDs. I contacted nVidia, Abit, and Maxtor and all three companies say that it's not their hardware's fault and to contact one of the other two companies but upon replacing this motherboard with a motherboard that has a raid controller made by Intel (Abit AB9 Pro) the drives work flawlessly in Raid0 and Raid1 (I only have 2 of them).If you're not looking for SATA raid then this board should do what you need. If you're looking at this board because one of it's features is sata raid I'd suggest looking at a different board."
1,Useful fools,"In their heyday, Marxists used to call people who, while not being Marxists themselves, defended Marxism ""Useful Fools"". It seems this is a common phenomenon even today, since I see people defending an obvious (I did see the COMMERCIAL) commercial for Wall Mart, surely paid (indirectly?) by Wall Mart itself. Yes folks, this commercial, just like the Fed Ex commercial (that many people including me paid to see) Cast Away should fool no one (but unfortunately it does). This is even more suspicious that those ""experts"" that give world wide tours (without charging!, which proves they are being paid for their propaganda by ""unknown"" sources) DENYING the existence of subliminal messages (why would someone bother denying that?). If you want to be a useful fool go ahead and buy this (hey I did buy this to see the ""other side"" of the debate but this is not it, and I was suckered) if not, better go and observe a real Wall Mart yourself (a sad experience to be sure)."
3,IN A PARTISAIN WORLD BOTH SIDES ARE NEEDED TO FIND THE TRUTH,"In our media driven world where polar opposites espouse their own versions of truth it is necessary to take a jaded view of all information presented whether it be, the position presented by the pundits of a biased Union, a biased corporation, or a Koolaid drinker from either side. The Galloway brother's movie is important because it presents a side of the Walmart story that is ingored by the Walmart bashing crowd. You can say what you like about Walmart, but we are arguable a Capitalist Nation and, Walmart is playing by the rules for a profit. This movie presents much of the truth about Walmart. If you don't like U.S. trade policies, then complain to your congressmen and stop bitching about a company playing by the rules."
1,The worst propadanda piece I have ever seeen,"I can't believe this! I have seen portions of this slick propaganda piece repeatedly because it is sponsored by WALMART themselves. That is like writing an honest autobiography--it just does not happen. So for once, the little people get out a few truths on this corporate giant in their own grassroots efforts and that documentary is overshadowed by this powerful, slick advertising gimmick. Not worthy of critical analysis, avoids issues of human cost! On and on!"
1,Not associates - Prisoners,"Wal-Mart doesn't have associates - they're prisoners. I wonder if the makers of this film, the Galloways, have ever been inside a Wal-Mart store. If they had, any store, they would see the horror. Illegal aliens, overworked and sad-faced employees forced to manufacture politeness as if they were living in North Korea, a lowering of the standard of living in communities. Look, I shopped at Wal-Mart last week. It's hard. I know. But I'm going to do my best to stop going to Wal-Mart. This film is dishonest and corrupt and the worst kind of false propaganda."
1,You have got to be kidding me.....,"You know a company is guilty of the crimes attributed to them when they feel the need to actually make a movie defending themselves. Of,course,I am using the word 'movie' lightly. Hitler did the same thing and it was called Triumph Of The Will, which by the way is far more entertaining than seeing corporate lackeys attempting to defend their actions.I mean who else would rather see soldiers marching around, and a crazed lunitic screaming at the top of his lungs, than a bunch of wealthy CEOs lying through their teeth? Everybody raise their hands!This 'movie' is pure garbage."
1,No Closed Captions!,"The film I bought at a retail outlet in Spokane WA contains no closed captions! If I had known that, I wouldn't have bought it. The box should have contained a clear message: No Closed Captions! (Parenthetically, Amazon.com's description indicates the film IS Closed Captioned.)The content of the film is shallow, and it doesn't really address the issues raised in the more fully supported Greenwald film, Walmart, the High Cost of Low Price.If closed captions are not an issue, however, buy (or rent) *both* films to draw your own conclusion. Obviously, the truth about Walmart's impact on US cities and third world communities is somewhere between the images presented in these two films. I found the Greenwald film much more convincing."
1,Horrid!,"This documentary is poorly produced, has terrible sound quality and stereotypical ""life affirming"" stories. There was nothing in here to support Wal-Mart, their business practices or their philosophy."
1,Wage-Less: Bush Won the Election and All I Got Was a Job at Wal-Mart,"This movie stinks! How can anybody promote this crap of a business. The same people whose jobs are being lost and whose small towns are being abandoned because of Wal-Mart are also voting republican and watching Fox News. All this because of fear, gays, guns and the bible. A documentary should be made about ethical businesses like Cost-Co, In-N-Out Burger, American Apparrel and Patagonia...these companies pay good wages and our socially conscious. Cost-Co was in fact criticized by Fox News for not being more ""considerate"" about their shareholders...that says it all about Fox and the GOP. Yes! I believe Capitalism can work for everyone including the environment when done with compassion and not by greedy social darwinists."
2,A frustrating release...,"As I would think that most people who are interested in this CD are Association fans, I'm going to tackle it from that perspective.Unfortunately, this CD is something of a ripoff. The title track is easily availible on the Japanese From the Original Master Tapes compilation, and once that's removed, we're left with the 7"", the instrumental title track, It's Gotta Be Real, and Brenda's Theme.Four tracks for (the money), in other words.It's very frustrating as well, because It's Gotta Be Real is an excellent song (better than the version that shows up on Stop Your Motor, IMO). Hopefully, all of this material will show up on Rhino's eventual Association compilation. But these five tracks are NOT worth the asking prince."
5,Close The Door There's Air-Conditioning!,"......that's one of my favorite lines from one of my favorite films from the late 60's.........the album compliments the film quite nicely and, although much too short(they should have also included the opening music accompanying the pool scene and the wedding music also!!!) I have to give it a 5 star rating as for what's on the CD is basically the essential score & songs from the film and I've longed for this album for many years......The Association songs are fantastic, especially the haunting ""So Kind To Me"", bringing the beautiful Ali MacGraw instantly to my mind.....Luigi ~ nyc"
5,Charles Fox's score shines,"I haven't seen the film but being a fan of the work of Charles Fox (and The Association), I had to add this album to my collection. And while the Association's songs are good and they get top billing for the album, the real star of the soundtrack is the score by Charles Fox, which is outstanding. All of the tracks by Fox are a precursor to his Emmy-winning score for another Paramount project: a comedy anthology series for TV titled LOVE AMERICAN STYLE. I highly recommend this soundtrack to fans of the movie, The Association, and the work of Charles Fox."
3,A Dry and Technical Novel,"I was disappointed in this book because I was looking forward to more of a full mystery,adventure fictional novel.Though over all it was well written from a certain point of view and if a reader is into reading more technical kind of books rather then a full story then this book is for you.I lost interest in it half the way through."
3,Decent oceanic thriller,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, although the pace is slow in the beginning. There's a little action but it's mostly character development and to the author's credit, the characters are fairly believable. The problem for me is that there's too little fun in this book. The plot of the book has microscopic organisms developing into a collective, a large oceangoing monster that consumes everything in its path. It makes Jaws look like a guppy.The author, however, is intent on beating his readers over the head with scientific facts and trivialities which lend the book an air of authority, instead of simply having fun with his creation. Two authors who consistently write good thrillers are Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, yet they never take themselves too seriously, which I felt was this author's only failing."
3,Chris Dufrene,"SEA CHANGE is well written for being James Powlick's first novel. The storyline is very believable. The problem is that the plot lacks suspence. Also, the technical jargon decreases the reader's interest. I do however, look forward to reading his second novel to see if his writing style has improved."
3,Explained a little too much,"As a high school advanced Marine Biology student, I was assigned to read a book that involved something about the ocean. Although I did enjoy Dr. Powlik's book, the in-depth explanation of the obvious made it difficult to continue turning the pages. With less than a year's worth of education about the ocean, I felt as if it was assumed that I did not even know that a Jellyfish (Phylum Cnidaria) had stinging cells. I am sure that such information could be helpful to those who know nothing about the ocean, but it spoiled the experience of this book for me. I must say I did gain some information about the ocean, but no more than I could have learned on a field trip to MBARI. I hope that you are not as disappointed as I was."
4,NOT THE BEST BUT VREY GOOD,I really liked this book and it was hard to put down. It's not the best but it was well worth the money and it was scary about what could happen in the water. It was like Jaws but with a different twist. I really liked it.
4,I definitely will get the sequel,"For a first novel I found this to be well written and really well researched. The subject is a reality and very scary! Powlik has created in Brock Garner a new and exciting""Dirk Pitt""like hero(although no one can measure up to Pitt). All in all a very readable book."
5,It gives you goose pimples!,"This book caught my attention as I was walking in a book store, and I just knew I had to buy it. I went with my gut instinct, and I'm glad I did! This story is amazing, and what's more amazing is that it could become a reality! The author knows a thing or two about such scientific matters, and I'm sure that he didn't just write this story to scare us, but because we should always be careful about our environment. We never really know what's out there. That's what makes it great. I would recommend it to anyone with strong guts, and a mind for science and mysteries. I sure enjoyed it, and I'm sure that a lot of people will agree with me. Read it, and you will not be dissapointed!"
3,An Average Read,"James Powlik did a mediocre job in writing so that his work would appeal to a wider range of audiences. A downfall of his writing is his use a lot of scientific terminology that makes it hard for the average reader to grasp a concept that may be easy to understand. I often found my interest lost due to the amount of scientific terms and unnecessary information. I also found it hard to relate to any of the characters in the book. There were so many, most expressing little emotion, which took away from the story as a whole. I did enjoy some of the imagery Powlik used when describing victims of the Pfiesteria."
5,brilliant debut! when's the sequel?,"It's not many writers who can blend together believable characters and emotions with a page-turning plot, not to mention the horrors of a real-world monster lifted from the day's headlines. Powlik's ""Sea Change"" delivers all this and more, with enough content to satisfy those in search of a romance, mystery, adventure, or a science thriller. This book has far more depth (pardon the pun), action, credibility, and humanity than typical so-called thrillers ever deliver. It's bound to attract a very broad readership."
2,Not a page turner,"This book is fairly well written, the science is accurate and the characters are well enough developed. There is just one problem. The author has no idea how to develope any suspense or even any real interest in what happens. I am in the middle of reading this book right now and I could care less how it ends. A good thriller will make you want to keep reading all night to see what happens. At no point in the first 270 pages have I ever even wanted to read the next page to see what happens. The author just doesn't have a knack for story telling. I am surprised that anyone other than a marine biologist would call this one a page turner."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"In light of the reviews already written on ""Stolen Hearts,"" I thought it would be a really great book. I was disappointed. At best,this book is mediocre. Michelle Martin is not at all like SEP, as one fellow reviewer suggested. And while this story does have an interesting premise, Martin did not spin the story in a way that really caught my attention. Moreover, Tess Alcott is a highly unbelievable creature, and to make matters worse she is incredibly pretensious. As for Luke Mansfield, he is a static character, boring and completely lifeless. On the other hand, ""Stolen Hearts"" is a great improvement from ""Stolen Moments,"" also written by Michelle Martin. So for anyone reading this review, I suggest you get the book from the library. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,too light,"The story has potentials - an imposter who is actually a genuine article but doesn't know it. But the book didn't live up to them. The characters are likeable but under-developed, the plot is simplistic and predictable. The author tried too hard to write cute and funny dialogues, but failed. I got really annoyed - can't they talk like intelligent adults instead of sparring teenagers. Overall this book is superficial, frivolous, like a book written by adolescents for adlescents."
2,diver/sport watch,"Gave this watch to my husband as a gift. Looked and worked great, until he went diving with it...not a diver watch. Not sealed and ruined works after diving. Disappointing."
1,Great Movie - Terrible DVD,"If the packaging doesn't frighten you away, the transfer will. The package is covered with scans from the movie that a 10 year old could make on their home computer. The DVD transfer looks like it was taken from a VHS tape. The telltale glitch VHS is at the bottom of the frame the whole time. This is not what DVDs were made to do. Everything about it says amateur. Watch this movie on VHS, the quality will probably be better than this version. This is an excellent movie that deserves far better than this treatment."
2,bad quality dvd- good movie,"This DVD is very bad quality.Both sound and image are awful.And on top of that, the DVD jams before the end, I never could see the conclusion.It's too bad for the movie that seems to be good."
5,Excellent,"I particularly liked this movie because the main character, Mr.Johnson, who was black was trying so hard to be a proper English gentleman in the small village of East Africa. Putting on airs & talking the administrator into thinking there was more money for building roads when there wasn't. In essence, embezzling. Living from hand to mouth until finally killing someone & facing the gallows. You feel sorry for Mr. Johnson at the same time wondering how he can get away with all his shenanigans. But the administrator is an enabler & is partly to blame."
4,Interesting Product,This is a unique looking pot and for those of us who have very little space it works out well. I have used it to plant herbs on the sides and a tomato plant on top. The only draw back is that the entire pot is connected so you must choose plants who have the same watering needs. All in all I love this potter.
2,Disappointed,"Money better spent buying Sarah Eames' Barbie Fashion books. This one added nothing and fell short in some respects. Photographs are often poor and close-ups blurry and grainy. Some things had no pictures, just a name and list of items. There are also some errors. And, I realize this is a matter of opinion, but the dolls seemed ackwardly posed in many photos, which is distracting for a reference book. Sorry I couldn't rate it better."
3,"These are OK, Couldn't find the old 5 tab White sets w/ single print stickers","These are just ok. The tabs are colored, which looks somewhat childish, especially in a business setting.We often label tabs as we go, which makes the easy apply labels more cumbersome than the old sheets that you could print as you need from a word template.Price-wise, they're much more expensive than the Office Max brand which accomplish what the old Avery tabs used to much better.Would recommend a trip to Office Max if it's an option. Otherwise, there don't seem to be any better alternatives on Amazon Prime."
4,"Solid, but needs some caveats","This is a solid wrap-up of much of Branden's previous (to this) work on self-esteem. While not everybody may be able to (or at least, may want to make the effort to) get into the mental actions of his sentence completion method, even for fidgety minds or bodies, I believe the effort is worth it.That said, as with any Branden book, this is not a substitute for professional counseling. And, self-esteem work like this will not touch major endogenous depression, nor externally-driven things such as the aftereffects of PTSD. Unfortunately, Branden doesn't always make that clear."
2,Pretty good but there's another that's much better,"I've read this book about 2 years ago so I can't really get into the details. It's pretty good but I think a much better book is called ""The Self Esteem Workbook"" by Schiraldi which I would definitely recommend over this one. Also Self-Esteem by Channing is another good one but more complicated."
2,Ehhh I've seen better,The first chapter has a lot of common sense folded into a dense quantity of truth but after that I didn't find the book incredibly helpful. It's not very good for someone like me who doesn't hate herself just would like to take her self esteem to the next level.
3,The Fear of Guilt,"In curing the ills of low self esteem we don't want to go to the other extreme. Some of the techniques presented are good and sensible, but they basically present feeling guilt as always being bad. Guilt is part of having a conscience. Not having a conscience will lead us to hurt other people. Lead us to be very selfish indeed. Unless, selfishness is what is being sought after."
5,This book is a must. It changed my life.,"I read this book in the summer of 1996. This bookwas a life turning point for me. My life was falling apart. My husband left me and my 6 & 7 year old girls were very insecure. I read this book and DID ALL the exersises suggested. My husband has returned and if any one thing attributed to my new healthy life, it was this book. Thank you Dr. Branden for saving my life."
3,NOT IMPRESSED,"This book talks about ""honoring the self."" It covers such things as the importance of self-esteem, self-concept, self-acceptance, liberation from guilt, integrating your younger self, living responsibly and authentically, nurturing, selfishness, and more. Seems like it would cover all basis, right? But this book is bland and reads like 100 other self-esteem books. It's just not that impressive. If you've read other books on how to feel good about yourself, spare your time to read this repeat. If, however, this is your first attempt to find help, this book may offer you the tips and tidbits you need. I, personally, was not impressed and, frankly, quite bored."
3,Sound ideas but not inspiring,"I ca'n't dsgree with the ideas in this book - they are well researched and well argued but I found the book a bit unispiring and couldn't be bothered working through the excercises. I gave it away soon after reading it. However, that could just be me. It is a good book with sound suggestions. I am sure many people will gain valuable insights from it."
5,Changing the Meaning of Drawing,"This fabulous collction of virtually every one of the most vital contemporary artist is, simply put, a must. The talent and diversity of these works are astounding and envigorating. The title ""Drawing"" conjures up images of simple sketches, pencil works and other trite mediums of drawing. However, these works prove that drawing, the element of art that is the product of the artist's mind directly onto a surface, is fulfilled in every way. Works like ""Detail from Cremaster 3"" by Matthew Barney and other works by Ellsworth Kelly, Sol Lewitt, Anish Kapoor, Lari Pittman, Charles Ray and many others make this mini-volume a treasure worth investigating."
2,Stars are for the idea - expect it to JAM! ALOT!,"Ordered this for a big presentation I had, it was a waste of money. We have a printer that meets the specifications outlined, the only one being that it be used with a printer that prints 11""x17"". We have a Konica (bizbub c452) which is capable of printing on card stock.I tried using this in the tray with varying stock setting and in the by-pass try. 1 or 2 came out good and then jam. I'd modify and repeat, same results. Finally moved it over to a desktop printer, same results. Finally gave up after wasting about an hour on this.Maybe the results will be different on an inkjet...This idea is fabulous, a pretty inexpensive way to customize all sorts of presentations and there is a CD included (no install required) that very easily allows you to format, but not at the expense of the time required, or for that matter the amount of product you end up wasting.Now I just want a refund."
4,Things I wouldn't have thought of!,"Wow! This is a really good book. It has exercises I wouldnt even have thought of to expand your mind, and I'm a experienced mind expander. Look at the world with the fervor of Da Vinci! Not much of a step-by-step plan, but has lots of things to consider. If you are a journalr, this will give you lots of ideas for what to write."
2,Less than meets the eye,"I have heard that Mr. Gelb is a gifted presenter and facilitator in the field of enhanced learning, so I bought this book based on his reputation. I must say, however, that despite the lovely presentation and rich illustrations, the insights in this book were often obvious or spread too thinly. Maybe I'm not representative of his readers, but I did not learn much in these pages. And the title is preposterous. Does Mr. Gelb really think that his own genius is in a league with Leonardo's?"
2,Where's the beef?,"The book's premise is interesting. What is it that made da Vinci unique and great? Can I observe his life and learn? Gelb's seven characteristics were insightful. The introduction of each characteristic was interesting. Sadly, there was no development, no depth. I'm sure Gelb's speeches and workshops are entertaining and inspiring, but when reduced to print, it's superficial, self-improvement, feel-good guru mush. It's pseudo science in a bottle - a cure for 21st century man with too much leisure and money and not enough purpose.There is page after page of exercises to help me become more like Leonardo. But sorry, but this left brained guy just can't bring himself to close his eyes and make ever larger circles (first with each finger, then the hand, then the whole arm...) all the while visualizing a rainbow of colors coming up through his body and out his fingertips."
1,Trash,"According to the back cover, this book should be located in the self help/business section of the bookstore. I suggest it be relocated to fiction/comedy. If it's a good laugh your after, buy this book. The section on how to make an authetic minestrone (apparently Da Vinci's favourite everyday dish???) I found particulary amusing. Gelb suggests that while the minestrone is simmering, one should begin enjoying ""the synthesis of colours, textures and aromas"", as any good cook would. However, Gelb extends this appreciation for the simmering brew with the ludicrous suggestion that one should ""sing and hum the sounds of the emerging gustatory and olfacotry symphony"" and begin dancing ""your minestrone dance"". Some tips on appropriate ""Renaissance style"" correography would have been helpful at this point, however the ever aloof Gelb gets around this by stating that ""if you don't know what to do, then you have got the idea""..... What the hell does that mean..?"
1,Don't Bother,"One more poorly written self help book in a world that already has too many. If you're a fan of Oprah or Dear Abbey, then, by all means, read this book. All others beware."
2,How to Think Like Leonardo Da Vinci : Seven Steps to Genius,"I agree with an earlier reader that the title is great, however, the book is not at all what I expected. The author is very knowledgable about Leonardo da Vinci but the material is presented in a very dry method, which makes it hard to read to the end of the book."
3,Mostly other people's ideas,"If you are new to techniques mentioned in this book, you may be thrilled - if you are familiar with them, you may be dissapointed. Most of techniques presented here are nothing new - some are from the book the Einstein Factor, some are from Tony Buzan's books (i.e. mind-mapping), there is a touch of biography of Leonardo Da Vinci. A good deal of questions that are designed to jog your creativity in this book are questions that are part of just about any goal-setting workshop, and here for example, Tony Robbins comes to mind. And there are few questions which I believe anyone who has ever had even a remote interest in spirituality has already asked - as in ""What is my purpose in life?"" and ""How can I best serve my Creator?"" All in all I have expected some original ideas from the author, but what I've found is mostly a summary of methods, techniques and exercises offered through other sources."
5,Really thought-provoking and personally enlightening,"My husband and I are hooked! We checked out the book in the library, renewed it and want our own copy to play with and help stimulate our creative interests. Wonderful!"
3,Pretty,"This book was more pretty than practical. I had great expectations for this book but the excercises alone would take a year to do. As I read I kept getting more turned off and looking ahead to see if there were anything new. I certainly like the journal idea but that isn't new. I finally gave up, returned the book and bought something else..."
3,"Interesting, but not excellent","Michael Gelb presents a layman's understanding of the habits and history surrounding Leonardo da Vinci. His premise is a simple one, copy these habits, and your life will be enriched. Of course, for the everyman, this involves drills - forcing yourself to follow a step-by-step method as prescribed by the author. I agree with Gelb's essential motivation, that da Vinci is an excellent person to model your life after, but have found that a study of da Vinci from an historical perspective may well befit those seeking to follow his life as example. Start with Bramley and Reynold's Leonardo, then try the reproductions, The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vince, Volumes 1 and 2. You'll enjoy it more, and come away much more knowledgeable."
1,Not able to figure out what the essence is,"The question I have is can genius be made like a 10 step program the book outlines ? I doubt any of the genius people who live in our midst read this book and became one. Steve Jobs? Thomas Edison? How did they become genius. I am of the belief that the foundation put during school years, genes, luck play a part in becoming a genius/no genius before they are 20 years old. Whatever corporate tricks/seminars we do, will have incremental effect and definitely polish one person's soft skill, but cannot transform a non-genius person to a genius person. I was hoping the book will be like a magic potion altering people, but I was sorely disappointed. Currently I am also reading and fascinated by ultra runners/meditation/plant based diets, and feel that me the path to creative spurts.This book was a drag for me and not my cup of tea. The assignments and work areas seem totally off for the context too."
2,Much bombast and fervent admiration,"Gelb presents some good ideas but his pompous tone and addiction to Leonardo's superiority over the rest of us undermine the structure of this book. I listened to it as a cassette series and caught myself shaking my head at Gelb's professorial inflections.Gelb's constant harping about how wonderful Leonardo was, down to his advice about going to the bathroom regularly, made me want to remind him that Leonardo was human and doubtless had flaws. Do I want to think like Leonardo, after hearing about how inventive and smart he was in so many fields? Not after hearing Gelb's devotion. A bit of humility goes a long way in opening up one's mind.The best advice in the entire book is to write in a journal."
4,How to STOP Thinking...,"When Michael Gelb honored me by being a guest on my radio show recently, and we got onto the subject of ""Sfumato,"" my heart sang. That was my favorite topic in the whole book . . . Da Vinci's ability to live with paradox and the unknown is remarkable, but we all possess this talent once we begin to let go and trust. The unknown and unknowable can only be embraced by those of us willing to live their lives by inspiration, rather than acting on viral memories that constantly bombard us. The Divine is constantly urging us, but with a very soft voice. Used properly, the Sfumato part of this book can serve as a guide to a powerful meditation. Thanks Michael! BTW, the other steps are a nice touch too."
4,Thinking Like Leonardo - That's a Challlenge,"I am a multiple-medium artist (writer, painter, chef, musician) and have been trying to find ways to access more faithfully the right side of my brain. This quest led me to the book. This book gives great exercises on how to stimulate the many-sided elements of our intelligence. Da Vinci was a brilliant, singular individual with extraordinary creative powers. Some of his life is included in the book, and I've enjoyed learning more about him, as well. His creativity in art, music, architecture, science, and invention were often futuristic and gloriously beautiful. If you are curious about what might be possible within yourself with your gifts, take the challenge and explore and develop your latent creative powers."
1,Waste!!!,"The one great thing about this book is the title. After that it gets considerably worse. Mr. Gelb, it seems, doesn't really provide any great insights in how to think like Leonardo, but rather common sense ideas that you could get from the millions of other self help books out there. This is one book that I would recommend passing. The ideas are common sense, if not borderline ridiculous."
3,sensationalisticismo!!,learning how to think like Leonardo is going to take far more than what you'll find here. That said this book contains a nice overview of the kinds of things that Leonardo would have stressed: the science or art and the art of science and the ability to see clearly.The book is worth a read but it is pretty light on real substance - Leonardo looked closely so it then exhorts you to look real closely at the world around you. Multiply that by a dozen techniques and you've got the material covered.
5,It takes you to the next level & changes the way you think.,"Much has been written about Mind Mapping, speed reading, theories of multiple intelligence, and how to integrate mind and body. Having read Michael Gelb's books and attended one of his seminars, I had used many of the techniques with some success, but felt that the brass ring was still just out of reach. Michael's comment was that to take it to the next level you have to change the way you think. Sometimes it takes a human example to understand how something works in practice. ""How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci"" points the way better than a hundred books explaining the theory alone. It breathes life into each of these ideas, and offers you a cornucopia of ways in which to pursue your own personal path and passion. It challenges you to make your own future and rediscover the past. Best of all, it works!"
2,Like Dumpster Diving,"Sure, there are some good things here, but you have to wade through a lot of trash to find them. Gelb sets out his seven buckets at the beginning, and proceeds to toss things randomly into them, whether or not they actually fit there. Exercises float in and out of reality without being tethered to any purpose, and not just the silly ""ambiguity dance"" quoted elsewhere. Even granting that one of Gelb's main points is to ""Live with uncertainty"", the sheer randomness of the text is maddening. The whole thing feels tossed together in a hurry. Additionally, it is obvious that Mr. Gelb lives an upper-class, academic life, and several of his statements and ideas do not connect with life in my part of the world."
4,Worth the money...,"In the world of self-help books, this book is at the head of the pack for the average consumer. It is not a scholarly book, but still delivers higher level principles. While it is loosely based on Leonardo Da Vinci (and even encouraged me to research this brillant man), it does extrapolate ideas that Leonardo used naturally in his thinking processes. I take all self-help with a grain of salt and glean the best from each, and this book has several excellent chapters and exercises I have not come across before. I'd like to see Gelb write another/deeper book where he is able to delve further into these principles and not water down some otherwise breakthrough concepts. Overall, my creativity and thought processes improved, and that's worth the money spent on this book. ~Carol D. O'Dell, Author of MOTHERING MOTHER, Kunati Publishing, January 2007."
1,This offering is pabulum at best.,"While some of the biographical background and quotations are interesting, the main body of this book offers some absolutely silly suggestions for emulating the thought process of Leonardo. If he were to read this I'm sure that he and his compatriots would have a good laugh. When I reached the ""exercises"" I was reminded of some of the infomercials that dominate late night TV. I would not be at all surprised to see Gelb hawking his audio tapes soon. A waste of time. Anyone sincerely interested in learning about Leonardo would do well to look elsewhere."
4,"Provocatrive, stimulating",This book is a must read for anyone intersted in expanding their own intelligence or understanding the new thinking about just what intelligence really means. As a retiured school psychologist with over 30 years of measuring intelligence I found this read provocative and stimulating should be requred reading for all interested in the field of intelligence
4,Interesting,"Very interesting book, easy to read. It has some great examples to follow along with that helps you get involved with what the author is writing about."
3,biography or art analysis?,"The color reproductions are excellent, far better than most art books. My main problem with the book is that it does little to link the artist's life with the substance of the paintings. It is as though there are two thrusts in the book; Balthus' biography and his work but very little on how the two interact."
3,They are still screaming,"The Suicide Machines are back with their new album A Match and Some Gasoline. The cd brings back the sound that many fans remember from their first two cds Destruction by Definition and Battle Hymns. Although it does have the sound of their older songs, it doesnt seem to have as much overall appeal as the older stuff. Some songs do have nice catchy tunes such as Did You Ever Get a Feeling of Dread? and The Change while there are even more ballads straight out of Jay's throat like Beat My Head Against the Wall and Your Silence. If you have been a long time fan of this group you will definately want to pick this up, but don't expect anything new that you haven't already heard. The cd is entertaining but in the end leaves you a bit unsatisfied."
2,hey shane!,"After going to the store to purchase a copy of the new Suicide Machines CD ""a match and some gasoline"" and popping it in my CD player I was extremely dispointed. The CD lacked the heart great tunes of the earlier albums (""destruction by definition""). While the lyrics might be more meaningful and thought provoking then the previous CD's the CD falls way short of a great ska/punk album. Don't get me wrong, this CD is definatly worth a buy, but I would suggest picking up some of there earlier stuff."
5,"Well-made, works perfectly, cheap price","Butter bells aren't complicated products, so there isn't much to review. All of the pieces on this fit, it's a good size, the water seal works perfectly, and the packaging was good. It's made of thick, heavy ceramic, so it should last for a long time."
5,best thing ever!,"Wish I had bought this a long time ago, I don't know why everybody doesn't have one! We are ordering at least two more!"
4,"Works well, but add salt","I bought this after seeing many others for higher prices. So far, so good. It holds 1 stick of butter and the butter stays soft. The box doesn't say this, but if you add salt to the water (and keep bread crumbs out of the butter), the butter won't mold. I have seen others that have holes in the bell to let the water get to the butter as you use it up. This one does not have that, so it is a good idea to top it off occasionally to prevent an air bubble from lingering under the bell and defeating the purpose of the water. You should also tip the bell as you raise it from the water so you don't create a vacuum that will suck the butter from the bell if you raise it straight up.This contraption does NOT work with margarine, so don't even try that."
2,Returned two of them--poor quality control,"First one came cracked, second one came chipped. Gave up."
1,"Don't buy it, the butter falls out","I hate it is right. You have to put the butter in, then turn it upside down in the base filled with water. When I took it out of the base, the butter fell out onto the counter. I don't use it at all. It's a stupid design. I'm sorry I bought it. I just wasted my money.,"
5,Works Great!,"Ordered 2, one for me the other as a gift. Stuffed a stick of Land-O-Lakes butter in the bell a few days ago. The butter stays very creamy, and the color doesn't change as it does when it sits on an open butter dish. So far I'm pleasantly surprised. I like the color too, kind of 'retro' as my teenage daughter would say."
3,"Works, but not that special.","It works, but no better than keeping your butter in a sealed container on the counter. Like, clean and reuse a margarine container. It already keeps a nice seal. This does look nicer, though."
4,Humidity a Drawback to Norpro Butter Keper,"The Norpro Butter Keeper certainly does what it is supposed to do--keep the butter at room temperature. The idea is fill the bottom half one-third full of water and the top part with butter and place the top upside down in the water. However, on a hot humid day I have found that the butter falls into the water, and it has been necessary to place the butter bell in the refrigerator. Nevertheless, I would still buy this item. Also, its simple design makes it suitable for any decor."
5,Handy item saves me money,"Even in a butter dish the taste of refrigerated butter goes off from absorbed odors. I was throwing butter away, but now it stays sweet on the countertop. Glad I bought it."
4,I love my butter keeper,"I bought this butter keeper this (hot)summer because keeping the butter in the fridge made it too hard to use on toast, and keeping it on the counter ended up in a puddle of melted butter. Keeping butter cooled in water keeps it spreadable all the time. The container can get a little grotty, especially with less careful kids using it, but no more than a butter dish would get. I highly recommend this and the price is right!"
5,So great we got grammy one,"Wonderful product. Easy to use, easy to clean. Just make sure to change the water every other day or so. My only complaint would be the lack of different color bands, but that's just semantic.One of the most used items in our kitchen. Get one today!"
5,love this item,Very pleased with the seller. I ordered this as a Christmas gift the first one arrived broken and they replaced it in record time so that I had it for Christmas. Second one arrived in perfect condition. I would definitely order from them again.
5,I wil keep this butter keeper!,"This is a wonderful addition to have in my kitchen. I always have soft, fresh butter, in a more compact and attractive container rather than a greasy butter tray that usually results in spoiled butter. So far no problems, I would recommend this to anybody!"
3,Developed a crack after 1 year,"I didn't drop it. I don't have a dishwasher. It's never been heated. Even so, the glaze on the butter cup developed a crack. I don't think the ceramic under the crack is cracked but the butter has been seeping into the crack and discoloring the ceramic underneath. I don't feel it's safe anymore. I'm tossing it out and getting something with a tougher surface.I love the idea though and it worked well for several months."
4,Works GREAT not superior quality but decent,"About 2-3 weeks into first use and I'm amazed how perfect the butter is. In 68F room, the butter is pretty firm, not mush like if left on the traditional stick plate with glass dome. Butter tasted today just like the day I out it in.It's very important to keep the water fresh because there is natural bacteria that will get in there.There is a common misconception about these butter crocks. Many people think that the water fits up into the butter, but just like a cup held upside down in water, the air in the inverted dome just holds the water out. (when completely full of course the butter will touch the water but water and butter don't mix and it.s actually kept even fresher because there is zero air).Lost one star because the build quality is not the best: there are some rough edges on the ceramic that would have me rate it worth more like half the price they sell.-awr"
1,Not even worth a one star...,"I have no idea how this is getting so many good reviews. I know I am not stupid, but I can't keep the butter from dumping out into the water every time I lift up the lid. We live in a dry climate and have air conditioning in our house, so I don't think it is the heat. I would love to hear how others got it to work."
3,"It does its job well, but...","Never having used one before, I was pleased to see how well the butter keeper works. It's such a practical gadget based on a simple principle.Unfortunately, after about six months the Norpro revealed a problem that makes me think it should be replaced. The glazing developed many (almost invisible) hairline cracks under the butter, and oil from the butter was then absorbed by the clay container. After washing and drying, the container now slowly oozes rancid oil through the glaze. It continues oozing for many days, even after repeated washing.I have come to love having softened butter on hand, and I will definitely buy another butter keeper, but I'll try a different brand. Perhaps this is one instance of getting what you pay for."
3,Performance depends on ambient temperature,"The ambient temperature in the room where you keep this has a significant effect on how well it works. It's pretty much the ideal way to store butter if the room temperature stays constant between about 60 and 75 degrees F. Below 60 degrees, the butter will be too hard to spread without tearing soft bread; above 75 degrees it will begin to melt and spoil even though air can't get to it. I much prefer fresh air, so I use heat and A/C as little as possible. When the indoor temperature falls within the optimum range I use and enjoy the butter keeper very much. Since that works out to be about half the time here in Western NY, I'm giving this three stars. The rest of the year I keep the butter in the fridge. I haven't seen anybody else even mention temperature as an issue, so I'm doing it."
4,Butter Keeper,"In this Louisiana heat, the water doesn't stay cold enough to keep the butter soft without falling into the water. Once it gets cooler here in cajun country, I'm sure that the butter keeper will work wonders! Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase, just wish it wasn't so hot in this part of God's country!"
1,Dissapointed,I am dissapointed with the Norpro. The butter would constantly fall out of its bowl and into the water bowl after being exposed to room temperature for only 15 minutes. I do live in a warm climate(Alabama) but we have the air conditoner running!I now use the Norpro as a butter dish and place it out side the refrigerator about 30 minutes before using the butter.
3,Works well until the end,"This product works well. Just a minor note - you keep having to put more and more water in as you use up the butter so that towards the end you have a lot of water sealing a little bit of butter. Overall though, it is a good product."
5,NICE LITTLE GADGET,"The price on this item is cheap enough (over other choices) to warrent trying, so I did. I load a small amount of water as anyone would in the bottom and the butter I simply take a single stick of 8 oz. center it in the bottom of the keeper area with the wrapper open at top and push/force it down, with hand pressure, into the bowl that is meant to contain it. No muss, no fuss. So far it is keeping very well. To clean, I use a paper towel before the next load of butter, wipe it out then rewipe out with vinegar on another paper towel. I do the same for the balance of the container. It is working well for us and the butter is nicely spreadable at any time and also available for needed cooking. VERY HANDY. RSBlain"
1,doesn't work,I hate this thing. I can't keep the butter from falling into the water after trying so many different things. It's a shame because it really looks good on the counter compared to a butter dish.
3,soft butter,Great concept but I am having trouble with the butter molding. When I just leave it on the counter in a butter dish it doesn't do that.Does anyone know what I could be doing wrong? There were no instructions.
5,A must have for the butter lover!,"Fall in love with butter again! Holds one stick of softened butter on your table for easy spreading on rolls, just change the water every three days!"
2,mold,"It's a nice looking product but the butter get's moldy. I'll try one more time.wash in soapy water,use salted butter, keep filled with clean water and change it every two days. got my fingers crossed!!"
3,It will serve it's purpose but...,"I purchased this because I liked the simplistic look of it, and I'm sure it will serve it's purpose. However if I had known it was Made in China I would have gone to an artisan here in the US and asked them to make me one like it thereby supporting my local economy. I am a bit irked to be honest I had searched ""butter bell USA"" and it came up in the search and the page said nothing about manufacture location so I trusted Amazon's search engine to have pulled up what I wanted thinking that though it wasn't specifically listed on the page that Amazon would know better even if it wasn't there after all they're the ones fullfilling the order :::sigh::: If I didn't need it so badly for the holidays I'd be sending it back."
3,Help,"I wonder if I am doing something wrong my butter keeps dropping out of the lit and into the water when i pick the lid up, i really like the size and thought of having soft butter, but if it keeps happening like that i want my money back"
5,Best Invention Since Sliced Bread!,"No more torn up pieces of bread and toast from trying to spread cold butter on them. This little handy, dandy kitchen accessory is a must-have! I don't reccommend use during summer or humid weather - it doesn't work so well in that climate, but great in the winter! Change the water out every few days to keep it fresh. And I only keep a half stick in at a time in order to keep the butter ""clean"", free of breadcrumbs, etc. Don't break it! My only complaint is that I wish it said ""butter"" in raised letters on the pottery - that would make it easier for guests to figure out what is in it!"
3,Norpro Butter Keeper,"I am generally happy with the butter keeper but compared to another ""butter bell"" that I ordered on-line this one's ceramic is a little thinner around the edge. One I gave as a gift chipped easily on the first use.I did like the choices of colors that were available as well."
1,cracked,Mine also arrived with a hairline crack in the vessel-seems to be a common occurrence with this brand.I would try another.
3,If only the butter wood stay in the lid.,"I love butter keepers. They keep the butter sweet, fresh and spreadable. Unfortunately my old one broke so I went shopping for a replacement. I already have the Norpro Garlic Keeper and have been very happy with it and decided the Norpro Butter Keeper would be a nice choice since it matches the garlic keeper. I bought 4 Norpro Butter keepers all at once. Unfortunately no amount of careful insertion will keep the butter from dropping out of the holder into the water. I have used other butter keepers before and have not had this problem. I can not recommend this particular product. This is unfortunate as it is a rather attractive piece of crockery. Oh well. Butter keepers do work but if you want to try one buy a different model."
2,Keeps butter soft...but it falls in the water,"Maybe I'm doing something wrong by putting too much water in the bottom, but mine isn't working properly. I may see if amazon will exchange it for another. It doesn't seem to make an ""air tight"" seal at all. Mt butter was very soft, but it fell into the bowl of water. I really wanted to like this product. Meh."
3,Butter Keeper,"While the product is very nice looking, it is small. I also did not expect that you would fill the bottom with water and the top with butter...I don't get the concept and you have to make sure the water is cold and you don't put too much in the bottom or your butter will be wet. I thought I was buying a regular stoneware crock to keep butter in."
3,Norpro Butter Keeper,I was upset with this product because the lid is not glazed on the top edge and has a dent in it.
3,Mold in butter,"I think this is a great idea and everyone seems to like their butter keeper. However, my butter went bad after 1 month of being in the butter keeper even though I changed the water every couple days. Opened it one day and there was mold in the butter. I don't know what I did wrong with it."
1,Not Received,"I would love to review this item but I have not yet received it. I ordered it on the 25th of September and there is no tracking other than it was shipped. However, they have deducted the money from my account. I do not know how to reach somebody to complain other then this review. Very disappointed in Amazon and this company."
5,Good,"Great little gadjet. I love soft butter on my toast. This allows it to do both, stay fresh and soft"
2,Arrived Broken,"The butter keeper was packaged with the cast iron skillet I had bought and this is probably why it arrived broken. I already have one of these at home and this was for a gift. I would recommend getting one, just make sure you get it buy itself or with books and not a cast iron skillet."
1,Not glazed!,"I was not able to use this since both the top and bottom, when using it, were so poorly ""glazed"" it would have scratched my granite counters! Company was listed by Amazon ""as not providing replacements""!!Save yourself some time - buy a better one from a different brand & company!"
1,disappointed,I have been waiting for approximately 2 weeks for this to arrive It came today with the top of the stoneware keeper broken. The top and the bottom was only separated by cardboard which did not appear to be packed correctly. Hopefully the vendor will replace without any additional charges to me.
4,Cook's Illustrated Magazine recommends this product.,"This is what Cook's Illustrated Magazine & website said about this item (theNorpro Stoneware Butter Keeper):""Recommended. The top of the Norpro Butter Keeper is filled with butter and the base is then filled with water (which must be changed every few days). When the two pieces are put together, the water forms a seal around the butter, protecting it from light and air (which make good butter go bad). We found that butter kept in the Norpro tasted fresh for a month."""
1,Save your dough,"ok, I have been married 31 years, keep my butter in the plain ole butter dish in the cabinet. It's never went bad, it's always soft when we use it and it doesn't require a special thingamabob. I learned from my mother-in-law (who was a dairy farmer's wife)."
4,"Excellent butter keeper, except...","Excellent butter keeper, except for the fact that it only holds one quarter pound stick and, when only a half a stick is left, it generally ends up in the water. For the job that it is supposed to do - keeping butter both safe and spreadable - it is great!"
5,Have softened butter anytime you want!,"I was skeptical about this item, but after a month, I love it. Unlike other reviewers, I have not had the problem with butter falling into the crock's water. It makes sense that since oil and water don't mix, the butter receptacle must be completely clean and dry prior to adding the butter. By following that rule and keeping the crock away from sunlight and heat (to avoid melting), I can't see any reason why the butter should fall out.Remembering to change the water twice a week is an easy task. We do it over the weekend and on trash day which works out fine. For softened butter any time we like, it's not a whole lot of effort. I'd say get one for every household."
3,Better Butter,"The Norpro Stoneware Butter Keeper I purchased is fine as far as butter keeping goes. However, I was disappointed in the color of the stoneware. It is pictured as being white white with a bright blue accent. What I received was off-white, almost cream, with a bright blue accent. My 3-star rating is for the color only, because had it been white white it would have received 5 stars."
2,Butter keeper,It was broken when it came so i was afraid to reorder it..I really wanted it for my son.but wasn't going to keep send pieces back.
2,Butter falls out into the water!,"I was so excited to get this product because I make a grilled cheese sandwich for my son very often and need soft butter to do so. Unfortunately, every time I open it up, the butter falls in a blob into the water. I followed the instructions to the letter but it keeps happening. What a mess!"
1,quality concerns,"my butter keeper arrived. I ran it through the dishwasher, top rack, then filled it as directed and enjoyed it until it was empty. Then I put it in the dishwasher again, top rack, and took it out this am and it has a crack in it. Not a surface hairline thing but a crack I can feel, which let water in to the china, leaving a stain. This was in the top part, which I've thrown away. The bottom may come in handy as a small container."
2,Great concept - Poor execution,"I ordered two of them - one was broken; the other developed a hairline crack as soon as I put water in it. I'll order another butter bell, but I guess this is a case of you get what you pay for - inexpensive, and cheaply made. I'll keep that in mind when I order other NorPro products."
1,Poorly Made...,"This product after a few months develops fine cracks/black lines. This leads to mold issues. Better off purchasing an L. Tremain, Butter Bell crock for a few dollars more. I have had the black matte finish crock for a couple of years and it looks like brand new...dishwasher safe and durable!"
4,butter has never tasted better!,"I grew up with a covered butter dish. Since using less butter as an adult, often when I'd go to get some butter it would be rancid. So I began keeping it in the refrigerator, so it was always hard and cold when I'd want it to be spreadable and room temperature. The Norpro Butter Keeper solved my problem. It's cute on the counter, and keeps my Irish unsalted butter (from Trader Joe's) sweet and fresh. I understand from a friend that, come summer, I'll need to change the water every day or so, but so far I've gone for a couple of weeks and the butter is consistently tasty. Very happy!"
4,This will make you a butter fan!,"This little butter bell is a fantastic buy. The price is very reasonable and the size is perfect for one stick or a 1/2 cup of butter. The temperature of the room does affect storage, but it helps to keep cool water in the base of the bell. During all but the warmest summer days here (N. California) our butter stayed fresh and easily spreadable. During the few weeks where it was above 78 in my house, the butter melted and plopped into the water below, which was a little gross.I recommend changing the water weekly, as little particles of butter can drop into the water below, and if left in they can start to go bad (especially in the warmer months)."
2,Fresh butter sometimes,"I own one - bought mine at my local T.J. Maxx and it cost me less than $5! I love this butter dish! I leave it near my sink area so I don't forget to refill it with cold water. I've use it almost daily and I've had zero problems with it.Edited to change rating and add:After a while of using this butter dish it's very inconvenient if you don't use butter frequently. Keeping the water fresh is key but it will only keep it fresh for so long (a few days) - then the butter becomes too soft and when you open the butter dish it will fall out back into the water dish. After a lot of consideration I just bought a tub of butter spread that keeps in the fridge, and I can use when/as I need (which is not often)."
4,FASCINATING BUT FLAWED,"I enjoyed this book though I found it flawed. Like many, I could not put it down and stayed up late into the night to finish it. For that reason alone, I would recommend it."
3,"Disappointed, this is just a feminist romance novel.","I very much looked forward to a historical novel set in my home city and taking place in my favorite time period. But, this book is more fiction than history. It is nicely written, which is its only saving grace but, it is tainted by the author's very liberal feminist views. I was very disappointed at the predictability of the plot and some of the things she has historical figures doing. If you like romance novels, this isn't too bad. If you like historical fiction--don't bother."
4,Graceful page turner that evokes a tumultous era. Lovely.,I found this to be a well researched and highly readable historical novel that had me hooked right from start. The author clearly loves her subject and kept me interested throughout. The characters seemed real as did the locale itself. Lovingly descriptive and informative. A most impressive debut work.
2,I had difficulty staying with the drama. Too slow.,"Having lived briefly in Buffalo, I looked forward to revisiting the city and getting to know her better through this book from a native. The plot is as thick as soup and I can't get it stirred enough to see what is in it. Honestly, I just don't like the main character."
5,City of Light,"This was an intriguing blend of history, suspense, feminism, romance. Best book I've read in a long time! I couldn't put it down."
3,Being a Buffalonian...,"Since I grew up in Buffalo, I really wanted to read this book. I thought the story line itself was just so so. However, I liked reading about the streets that she went down, and other historical sites that she reffered to in this book, as I knew them well. I think this book could have been a lot shorter, as Louisa tended to get very side tracked when she was talking to someone, or talking about something. She never really just got to the point. Anyway, if you are from Western New York I think you will really enjoy reading about the history of Buffalo."
4,"""City of Light"" Shines Brightly!","I picked this book off the shelf in the cottage we were renting in Maine. I had no idea what it was about and it was our 6th of 7 nights in the cottage and I was not leaving this book unfinished. I COULD NOT put this book down. The story is really interesting and the pace is great. I had gone to school at SUNY Buffalo in the 80's so it was a trip down memory lane for me, from the historical perspecitve of the book. The story is about the turn of the century when Buffalo was a social and intellectual focal point of the country and Niagra Falls was the most popular vacation destination...especially for honeymooners. I look forward to Lauren's next book!!"
3,"A fairly engaging, but flawed novel","I decided to read this novel while waiting for other books I reserved at the library to become available. While I enjoyed the novel overall, I found it a bit too slow and a bit too long. One hundred pages could have easily been edited out with little negative effect. Economy is not Belfer's strength. And the central mysteries are a bit clumsy and uninteresting, to be frank. A nice period work, though. And I found the central character interesting. Worth the time. A workmanlike effort."
3,OK,"I rarely stray from novels like The Triumph and the Glory, the Aubrey/Maturin books by O'Brian, and Clancy stuff, because I know what I like and who gives it to me with consistency. But I heard this was a good one so I ordered a copy. City of Light begins with promise and then slowly fades into average fiction in a lightly entertaining manner. It was OK. No better. No worse."
4,Kept me reading steadily for two days .,"I found the characters interesting and the issues regarding the power development worth one's concern. To be sure, the mystery was not quite up to Agatha Christie but also not as dated as her books probably are to today's readers. In any case, I would encourage people to raad ""City of Light."""
4,"History, Mystery and Drama","This is quite well-written for a first novel. The mixing of history, women's issues, drama and mystery go well together.The story takes place in Buffalo, New York at the time when electricity is beginning to be harnessed from Niagara Falls. There are some murders in Buffalo and the headmistress of a girls' school attempts to get to the bottom of things. There is a lot of personal and political intrigue. Real historical figures merge with fictional ones.This book is a gem and I look forward to future novels by Ms. Belfer."
1,a complete fabrication,"This book is about my family, and it really hurt us to both read this book, and to have our whole home town suddenly believe that our great grandfather was some sort of pedophile. Please read the giant disclaimer in this book. She made the whole thing up because she thought it would make a good story (which it didn't btw, and that's from a literary standpoint.) She didn't do her research, and upon meeting her and her mother at the Garret Club in Buffalo she was rightly embarrassed because she hadn't even bothered to find out if there were living descendants effected by her book. Poor literary skills, poor research skills, and poor ethics. Two thumbs way down.PS Amazon made me give at least one star. I wanted to leave it blank."
2,Lame storytelling at its limpest.,"There are many great first-novels out there. Go read them instead. Unless you like the tale of a corporate nun bound tighter than her hair bun. There are no surprises to this supposed mystery, because the storyteller has so ineptly tipped you off. I thought I was reading a book version of ""Blues Clues"". Too bad so much review space has been taken up by this blather. The author must be going to all the right parties."
1,"Boring,boring, boring","I gave up on this book after sloggingthrough the first two hundred pages.I simply couldn't bring myself to careabout the self-righteous heroine and her problems. The pacing was glacial,even the details about the developmentof electricity at Niagara Falls weredull, and I just didn't care."
1,As dry as sawdust is too kind,"I must confess that I lived in Buffalo for many years. But that has nothing to do with my view that this book is so pedantic and slow. Idid not live there at the turn of the century but I hoped she would bring it alive. As Stephen Crane once wrote, most people write about history as if they are coroners embalming a corpse. That's what we have here."
1,Dishonest,"I couldn't have been more disappointed. I ordered what was advertised as a brand new hard cover copy. Which I intended as a Christmas gift. The book I received is old, rounded corners, and packaged very haphazadly. There is no paperwork what-so-ever in the envelope to assist in returning. I will attempt to contact the shipper. I hope I didn't throw away good money."
2,"Buffalo, NY is the real protagonist","Although the writing was technically perfect, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was reading an almanac or tourist guide of Buffalo, New York made into a novel. Add to that the first person narration by a character I found to be unsympathetic and unrealistic... let's just say that I was not enthusiastic about finishing.The very detailed rape scene at the hands of a former president (confirming the painfully predictable plot) was the final straw... I could not make myself finish."
4,Fantastic Historical Fiction!,"Belfer's debut novel is amazing in that it aspires to do so much --- and succeeds! The author blends historical figures with fictional characters and does so seamlessly.The novel focuses around Louisa Barrett, headmistress of a school for girls from elite families in Buffalo, New York. The book is billed as part murder mystery, part love story, yet it works on many different levels, the combination of which cannot be defined easily. Louisa's tale unfolds somewhat slowly at times, and Belfer's research into the turn-of-the-century Niagra and Buffalo scene is evident, as her details sometimes become ""skim-worthy"".Overall, however, the novel is a fascinating look at money, power, and one woman's struggle at self-definition."
2,This book is not for me.,"I found the subject matter of Buffalo and Victorian era very interesting, but the book really didn't grab my attention until I was three quarters of the way through it. Way too much ""cloak and dagger"" stuff taking place for my taste. Every look, Every Move, Every Action seemed to have some mysterious dark overtone to it which made it very distracting to read. The plot does not merit such a long and cumbersome book. This could have been wrapped up in much fewer pages."
1,An editor neglected to do his/her job!,"City of Light was very poorly written. Endless descriptions (throughout the entire novel) did nothing to add to the author's long drawn out plot. Although premise, characters and settings might have had potential, Lauren Belfer needs to learn to write from her heart. She also needs to learn what it takes to engross a reader. I reluctantly read every page...only because it was a book club assignment. I don't recommend you do the same!"
4,Enjoyable as a leisurely read.,"This is a beautifully written book, and the lead character is wonderful. The machinations she goes through to preserve her position and her dignity in the society that she lives in are what makes this book an enjoyable read. The descriptions of life in Buffalo and the stifling social conventions of the time are fascinating.The book does, however, drag at times, and some of the other characters are not as well fleshed out. Tom Sinclair, a major character, remains a mystery throughout, and Grace, his daughter, is invariably described as perfection itself without really giving her any real life.I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction and is not expecting a potboiler, but rather an enjoyable read that can be savored slowly."
3,City of LIght Doesn't Shine Bright,"If you are a connoisseur of historical fiction, you will probably find this book a bit of a stretch. The first-time author does a good job in supplying info and insights into the power struggle behind the electrification of America in the late 1800s and early 1900s. But she falls short in her plot line, creating some rather improbable situations and leaving some of her characters flat. So if you are a history buff and enjoy books that paint a picture of a time and place from the past, you'll find the book somewhat enlightening. But if you are in to historical fiction that focuses upon realistic portrayals of a mix of real and fictional characters, this novel will not earn enough review stars to shine very brightly at all!"
2,Disappointing,"This book started out strong, and really grabbed my interest and held me. But the last fourth of the novel was hugely disappointing. I loved the development of the interesting characters, and the descriptions of NY during the dawn of electrical power. But the fascinating murder mystery was tied up in a way I found hasty and unbelievable. And the story's ending was depressing and anti-climactic. Why introduce two romances and spend pages developing them only to have both of them go nowhere? Why get us to invest our sympathy in the life of a charming and courageous heroine only to have her make mundane choices that result in such a dull and sad ending?Though I enjoyed most of it, I would not recommend spending your money on this book."
4,Society's conservation concerns have transcended years,"I am originally from the Buffalo area and have a Master's in Preservation. I listened to this on tape and can't wait to study how Buffalo looked at that time...not to mention to learn whether or not President Cleveland was such a disgusting pig. It is funny to hear the names of many people in the context of life, not the memorialized museum, hospital, road, etc. that we think of now in Buffalo. As we face a controversy over a bike path through a protected wildlife area in my area, it brings to the forefront that people have had concerns over progress vs. protection for years. The story itself was interesting and kept me occupied, however, the abridgement of the tape made me rewind a few times to make sure I kept everything straight. I also had to remind myself that this story takes place long before forensic detail was available."
2,Only if you're going to Buffalo,"If you're planning a visit to Buffalo -- a visit that I would recommend to anyone who's interested in late 19th and early 20th century architecture -- you'll find that this book provides a great deal of local historical color. Otherwise, however, it's basically a primer on how NOT to write a historical novel. Here's what you don't want to do: First, create a preposterous, sprawling plot that serves mostly to introduce a dizzying array of actual historical figures, albeit obscure ones to anyone outside of Buffalo. Then include a lot of wooden dialogue spoken by two-dimensional characters, and be sure to sprinkle your text with anachronisms (who had ""brunch"" in 1901?). And make sure your narrator spends a lot of time on historical exposition that makes no sense, given that she's supposedly addressing a more or less contemporary audience. I could go on, but you get the idea. It's a shame -- there's some interesting raw material here, and it could have been a good novel."
1,Too much doesn't lead you anywhere,"I got this book mostly because it was labeled as the New York Times notable book, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. Though everything started out lively, with a fun mix of fiction and historical setting, it didn't last long. About 1/3 of the way I started skipping paragraphs and even pages. The author tends to give a lot of unnecessary details about things and people completely irrelevant to the plot, and it gives the book a monotonous, boring feel. The plot was a see-through, and most of the times you could guess the next ""culmination"" before it even happened. To finish it all of, the book gives no real closure to the whole story line, instead going into pseudo philosophical conclusion. All in all, a huge letdown."
5,city of light,"The product, city of light, came in excellent condition. The book was most interesting as I was raised in Niagara Falls and so much of the story line was familiar to me. The book was historical, adventurous and mysterious. It came very quickly."
4,City of Light,"Having grown up in Buffalo, NY my husband and I enjoyed reading about many places from our younger days . We also used the book as a thank you for three grade/high school friends we visited in Florida, and they shared the same response. We also learned some things we had not been aware of,about the area.We left there right after high school, and the book took us back to some happy times and some good memories as well as being an interesting story."
2,Like pulling teeth,"I am currently on page 158 and a forcing myself to finish this pedantic tale of moral and intellectual snobbery. This book is one liberal diatribe after another. If you loved ""It takes a village"" you will love this tale of the evil rich and how the ""vision of the annointed"" saved us all from them."
2,"It was silly, but I read the whole thing","I wish I'd seen the customer reviews before I bought it, all the reviews I read led me to expect more than this silly little historical romance. The imposition of today's more liberal views on the society of 100 years ago has been done before and done more skillfully. Character development was uneven and the plot was obvious. Nevertheless, I read the whole book. It was uneven and disappointing, but I enjoyed parts of it (Grover Cleveland was hysterical) and I hope for more from the next novel."
2,just stick to your historical romances...............,"Triteness is the adjective that would best describe this turkey. Initially, I was drawn to its cover. Believing that perhaps it would provide me with an interesting mystery of the Victorian period, I soon realized that it was actually a historical romance with people in it who were basically uninteresting. I found the writer's detailed descriptions of the electrical plant and all the references to the falls boring, very boring, and along with her tendency to tell her readers more than they probably want to know, she managed to alienate me also with her insufferable stuffiness regarding her 'salon' or is 'saloon'? Wasn't she the gift of all of Buffalo because she was the mistress of the girls's school???? I kept reading in the hope that it would perhaps improve, but like all historical romances it never went anywhere......the only difference was not everyone lived happily ever after."
2,No Light from Buffalo,"CITY OF LIGHT is like Buffalo itself. A dreary, tired recasting of events and perspectives in the lives of tedious people. It's not worth the time or the energy to read. Western New York at the turn of the century may have excited Belfer but her excitement is like Western New York today--not contagious and on the skids."
5,Du-Ha storage console,The sturdy construction and well designed divider inserts make this a must-have for extended cab pickups. Wish I had purchased and install this when my truck was new; thought at the time that it was a bit pricey but not so.
5,Clutter Free,This product is awesome if you like a clutter free back seat. I had an issue getting it to fit with my husky liner in the back but it was more of a problem with the liner. The dividers are not great but you don't have to use them if you don't want to.
2,"Useful content, poorly written.","If you're into a stream of interesting facts, get this book. If, instead, you want something pleasurable to read -- try elsewhere."
4,Entertaining sci-fi from the Atomic Era,"This is an entertaining story with pacing like an Edgar Rice Burroughs book, the action never slows. The plot is classic Atomic Era, with a squad of ""Planeteers"" using A-bombs to blast an asteroid into a new orbit. Their feats include breaking one 5 kilo-ton A-bomb into pieces and making their own smaller bombs with just the tools they have at hand! There's lots of plot surrounding radiation exposure, but all in a sort of ""we can handle it"" way. All this while on a an asteriod being attacked by aliens (""Connies"", another give-away that this is the 1950's).What's even more fun is to learn that the author's real name is Harold Goodwin and he was director of atomic test operations for the Federal Civil Defense Administration!You should also check out his other books, the Rick Brant ""Electronic Adventure"" series under the pen name John Blaine. They were the inspiration for the TV series ""Jonny Quest""."
4,Space Oprea in the highest tradition of the Golden Age,"This novel is a wonderful literary flashback for the reader who longs for the offerings of Scence Fiction's Golden Age. Planeteer Rip Foster and his platoon must drive a radioactive asteroid back to Earth via a series of controlled atomic explosions. If this isn't enough trouble, some seriously Soviet-style bad guys want the rock, and stop at nothing to try to get it. This book is one of my best memories of my early forays into Sci-Fi, and offers much to please the sci-fi fan at your house."
5,This book is in Encyclopedia (unfortunately) in the truest sense of the word!,"This book is an encylopedia in the truest sense of the word. Wonderful if thats what you want. Imagine your encyclopedias on your bookshelf. If you wanted to learn about something you would search, and find a short papragraph of what you wanted. Nothing more, Nothing Less. THIS IS A WONDERFUL REFERENCE GUIDE. Nothing More. Nothing Less. Do not get this book if your looking to improve your mathematic skills. Especially seeing how the book, like all encyclopedias is structured A - Z, and has no ""institutional"" mathmatical structure or outline to show the progression from one area of mathematics to another, what-so-ever.IF YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A REFERENCE GUIDE, THAT PROBABLY WONT TEACH YOU ANYTHING, THEN THIS IS PROBABLY EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT. BUY THE BOOK!"
2,The album that wasn't necessary,"This album, the last of the group for Warner Bros., was an effort that lacked the voice of Russ Giguere, who had left the group in 1970. The album featured Richard Thompson as Giguere's replacement, and the entire project suffered from spotty song writing and musical arrangements that lacked focus and direction. The best songs on this album are Ted Bluechel's ""Bring Yourself Home"" and a song penned by Jimmy Webb entitled ""P.F. Sloane"" that enjoyed some air play on local radio markets in the Midwest. Otherwise, the album is pretty mediocre, with the songs written by Terry Kirkman, the groups best writer of song hits, being particular disappointments on this album."
3,"A decent into to Stockhold, but poor DVD quality","The content of this DVD is quite good and will be helpful if you are budgeting your time for a shorter visit to Stockholm. It will give you a glimpse of some of the locations you might miss. The overall quality of content is good, but the DVD seems to be an upscaling from standard video to HD. Lots of screen artifacts, particularly when there is motion in a scene."
5,"An informative, fun and beautiful book","I thouroughly enjoyed this book. Not only does it include precise and interesting information on the making of tequila, but its photographs are splendid! This book is full of character and displays Mexico's best known feature: TEQUILA! From its history to its making to some delicious recepies, this book is for any Mexico lover!"
1,Not a book I would recommend for tequila aficionados,"In my opinion to flashy, they are only taking advantage of the popularity of tequila, you can not even find it in Mexico. I would recommend much more books like ""The Book of Tequila"" by Mr. Emmons with real facts and tequila information."
4,Old bad joke detracts,"Picoult is a new author to me. ""My Sister's Keeper"" was recommended. The writing is precise and engaging with just the right amount of depth for the age of the each character.My only issue is the use of an old bad lawyer's joke about insurance and cigars early in the book. I heard this joke before Picoult was born and was appalled to see it presented as a serious conversation between Brian and Sara. If it was intended to be funny, it was inappropriate in the context of the book. If it was intended to pass for original thinking, it certainly was not that. There was nothing in context to indicate that this was tongue and cheek.I raise this issue because it nearly caused me to skip the rest of the book if that was what I might expect. But in loyalty to my friend, I kept on reading.Picoult is a fine writer, gifted. This joke was beneath her talent."
1,Do not by this modem please,I bought a Best Data mach II 56k Sent it back three time for all new ones. all gave crazy speaker sounds would not connect. do not buy this modem please you will be very sorry. . .
1,Poor modem,I purchased this modem it was a hunk of junk the tech support was no help . I was not happy with the quality of this modem .
3,No Problems....Yet,"I just installed this modem tonight and have only noticed one instance of irregular activity. The speaker came on in the middle of a connection. System is Cyrix MII 300 running Win98. I turned the speaker off (software setting) and have not had a problem since. After the rebate, a McDonald's value meal would be more costly! For this reason, I am willing to give it a chance. Based on what I've read though, I'll be keeping my 33.6 handy!"
4,Working pretty good,"I bought this modem and actually got it to install on the first try! I noticed a problem with the speaker staying on, however, when I called Best Data tech support they pointed me to an alternate best data web page that did not belong to the company that had newer drivers that fixed the problem! Now it is working great!"
1,I worked for hours trying to get this thing to work,I kept getting an error saying that there was no dial ton
1,"Run, don't walk, away from this modem","After lightning came through my phone line, causing my modem to always be open, I ordered a replacement modem through Gateway. This is what they sent me. Its nothing but garbage, which is where it now resides. Takes over a minute just to connect, several minutes to download one page, if they load at all, numerous disconnects, never a speed higher than 30 Kbps (when the old modem was getting between 40 and 44), and more often in the low 20s. After two weeks I stopped using this modem and am back to the damaged modem which still works better than the Best Data modem. Probably the worst computer-related purchase I've made in my life. If I could give this negative stars I would. And the next modem won't be purchased from Gateway."
1,To many problems,"Updated to a AMD-400 and have had nothing but trouble with this modem. I tried 2 of them to no avail. With the modems installed the speakers went crazy. With the modems out speakers are fine. 2 friends (computer guru's) tried to help but it will not work. I keep getting ""No Dial Tone."" I thought it was me but thanks to all of you I think I will go back to my 33.6 for now. I was glad to read it was not just my problem. Has anybody tried returning it to the company. The store won't take it back. I guess they know it is crap too!"
1,V.90 ?????,"I've installed this modem on my system, and as long as my internet provider was running at 26k not problem, when they upgraded to 56k v.90 I was not able to be connected for more than 30 sesconds, anyone else I know had not problem at all. This modem is BAD, I am returning it tomorrow !!!!"
1,Ditto Ditto Ditto,"This is the absolute worst modem. I didn't have too much trouble installing it, but it's performance is less than second rate...make that third rate. It is going back to the store."
1,This modem is worth what you pay for it!!!!,I bought this modem to go in a computer that I was built for a friend. I got the modem installed with a little bit of trouble but no problem I have had to deal with these problems before. Once I got it install I could only stay connected to the Internet for about two minutes before it disconnected itself. I call my ISP and it turns out the Rockwell chip is old and you have to flash it to get it to work. Needless to say unless you want to give the merchant a no interest loan don't buy this modem.
1,Modem No Good!,"I spent 5-10 hrs trying to get this modem to work in my AMD K6-2 450 MHZ to no avail. Even if it is free, I would not buy this again! I am returning this modem right now."
1,There is a such thing as QA,"I just brought this modem tonight; I attempted to install it in my parent's computer. The modem was not detected automatically by Windows as proclaimed in the manual, nor could I get it to be detected from the Win95 Control Panel/Add New Hardware function. I saw the reviews of the other people here on Amazon.com and I agree with their assessment. I do not have a Pentium MMX and at a minimum the ""so-called manual should have mentioned the MMX requirement. Even though I paid $ for it from Staples and I've watched the Dallas/New England game (while installing), I never had problems such as this before. I'm taking it back promptly tomorrow."
1,Best Data A56FW-PCI modem,"Please, do not purchase this modem. It is a piece of junk. I have two and neither work. When I tried to call Tech Support I found out they did not give from support. The first thing they ask for is a credit card number and they refuse to take back the modem and replace it. They claim it had to be improperly installed and the tech support doesn't have a clue on helping. All they are concerned with is how long they can keep you on line to charge for the call. DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING THIS MODEM, WHICH WE GOT AT OFFICE MAX! THE STAR RATING SHOULD BE A MINUS 10. IT IS A PIECE OF CRAP!"
2,Worst Data Products,I bought two of these (24.95 with a 20.00 rebate) You get what you pay for! Each modem was totally different. 1 worked fine. The other caused the PC to lose video and not boot up all the way up. The software and instructions were different for each modem. I exchanged the bad modem and got a third different modem. This one needs an MMX processor to work (not advertised on the box as a reqrmt) No way to call anyone to complain and web site has no support either!
1,get what you pay for!,"I had to choose a rating, but 1 star is too good for this modem. This modem was too good to be true.I read the reviews and still bought it.The actual install didn't go bad but I kept getting ""no dialtone"" error. So I switched back to my old moden and downloaded the newest drivers from BestData.They were the same as the c-d in the box.With the newest dated driver there was no dial tone, with the older driver it worked.Connected at 49+.After about 3 minutes the speakers went crazy.I gave up. I put my 33k Zoomlink back and am returning this JunkData modem tomorrow.I was told by the store{Office Max}that when this modem works it works very well, and that it works for about 85% of their customers.However, judging by these other reviews I am in the Majority. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS MODEM.The time that I spent trying to use it was worth more than the modem itself. STAY AWAY"
1,This modem is no modem,"I just bought this modem. I am surprise how bad it is. Rockwell had great experience in modems what happen with Conexant? . Because, it is not Best Data the problem. This is a one chip modem. All software is provided by Conexant. It is less than junk. Don't buy it."
1,Bad Bad Bad Modem,"Well, I thought I'd vent my frustation with this modem as have most of the other respondents. Best Data's/Conexants' lousy $10 modem is completely disapponting. Though installation was a breeze on my new 600MHz P3 w/win98, the performance is pathetic. Multiple retrys and frequent disconnects are the norm. There's also this really bizzare behavior where the modem's speaker will turn on in the middle of a session and will not turn off (have to disconnect). Tech support web site is mostly useless and I couldn't believe there is a pay per use phone support charge.I have a second 56k modem that I normally use in another PC and it works just fine thank you.I bought this modem with the expectation it would be a suitable backup for my cable modem. It doesn't even meet that low expectation.Best Data's A56FW-PCI Mac 2 modem is junk. Don't buy it."
1,"Speaker stays on continually, modem speed should be better","I installed this modem thinking that since is was made by Best Data it wouldn't be a piece of crap. However, it is a piece of crap. The Speaker stays on continually and the modem speed only gets up to about 40000. (my phone line is clean and my other modem always hits 48000+) I am returning it today."
1,A TIN CAN COULD DO BETTER!!!!!! THIS MODEM IS GARBAGE!!!!,"The modem works about 1/100 of the time... The speaker does not work most of the time, the modem does not connect without the speaker working (or probably the other way around). The drivers dont work.. they came on a cd with no directories, just a bunch of files. Within all these files there are about 10 different versions of the drivers. The ""installation manual"" is a one-page pamphlet. oh... and the v.42, v.90, v.80, and v.32 modes dont work.. when I do connect, i connect at 19200... GARBAGE!!!!"
2,Beware,This seems like a great deal and probably is. Buyers beware this modem requires 166mhz or higher. If you don't have it don't buy it.
2,finely loaded but speaker will not turn off,"I bought this item from OfficeMax last week for the same price. I had no problem loading this item to my win98 system. However, when I got it turned on I could not find any way to shut off the speaker. It runs continually even after the number is connected. I finely taped over the speaker but with this fix I can not hear the dial tone or initial dialup. And I still hear a faint white noise(continual static) in the background whenever I am connected to the net. I will be reinstalling my Eigercom 56K and returning this item."
2,Book: If Love is a Game...,"This book came highly recommeded by a friend who read it. I have tried many times to read it but find it hard to keep my interest, and not easy to read as it is kinda boring."
2,The book is quite complicated compared to other similiar titles.,"I'm now married with 2 kids, and I bought this book a few years ago when I was just dumped by my fiance.I moved to a different state right now, found new love, and living happily.I suggest those who are new into relationships to take the suggestions in this book with a pinch of salt.. I practiced a few suggestions and followed a few rules which led to quite awkward situations..."
5,Excellent,"This is the album I've been waiting for. Big, bright, witty and thoughtful, you can't ask for much more in a UK release like this."
1,Maison Cote Est magazine subscription,I am disappointed - I did not receive 3 of the 6and there is no one to report toNow I receive a renewal notification and I would not renewbecaust of this.
3,Rhinestones...but no seam.,I was disappointed that these stockings were seam-free; I needed retro stockings with seams. But I'm keeping them because the rhinestones are kind of cute and I'm going to enjoy wearing them as regular dress stockings.
2,Not as good as I thought.,"I had bought the Animal Crossing skin for my DS thinking it was worth the ten dollars I had paid. It isn't. It leaves a sticky residue that is hard to get off and ruins the DS. Do not get this product! Sure it protects it from scratches but it leaves a terrible sticky residue that is hard to get off.I would never buy another one again. Sure it looks cool, but it ruins the DS.I recommend to not buy this item."
1,Worst product EVER!,"I am extremely sorry I purchased this! The package was dusty, and the skin is so warped it won't even stick to my DS! The sticky stuff on the back is so old it doesn't stick well. I got stuck with a crap product, can't even do anything with it! The part that goes on the top is discolored as well, and has a scratch in it.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! It is NOTHING BUT JUNK!!!"
5,from the Martial Arts Video Review,"This is an interesting video that deals intensively with wristlocks. The video takes a base wristlock (one sometimes called a gooseneck or pigeon lock) and builds several types of locks, lock flow drills, come-alongs, and takedowns based on this initial lock. Mr. Kim does a fair job explaining the fine points of the locks and there is adequate verbal explanation of each move. The moves are shown many times, both in slow motion and in regular speed. This video would be a good learning tool for most beginning martial artists, particularly those who come from striking based arts and need to be exposed more to stand up jujitsu skills."
1,Wrist Locks Unusual Angles,"This tape described 9 different wrist locks most fromfront holding the elbow and applying pressure down onthe hand with your thumb on one side, 3 fingers other sideand index finger across the back of the wrist as you bendit down toward the elbow.I had trouble understanding the speaker.I did not like the video and would not recommend it.I gave my copy to Fort Pierce Police Officer."
5,Great product! Fast delivery,"Bought this for my mother, she loved it. One complaint she had was that there is a lot of accompanying gospel music that is rather loud, she prefers to listen to her CDs while asleep. She did say that the music was good though.If u want an audio sermon, why not have it read by ""Moses""?"
4,Plato Protagoras and Mene,"I was very pleased to receive this Protagoras by Guthrie as a comparisonreference help when translating the work. The book is in good condition,very reasonably priced and delivery was prompt."
4,Wonderful Wipes,"We purchased these wipes back in 2007, when my daughter was born. We have used them daily since then, washing them with cloth diapers, and drying them in the dryer. They have just started falling apart and unraveling. I don't think we could reasonable expect something to last longer, with daily use and hard washing. I am quite pleased and am now purchasing more. We use them with water only, and they get the job done. Save tons of money and avoid unnecessary chemicals with these wipes!"
4,Great wipes for the price.,These wipes are great for my infant. They clean up nice and easy and fit perfectly in our wipe warmer. Don't expect them to be supper soft. But for the price they work great and are easily washed and dried with the babies diapers and clothes. I have no complaints except the shipping was a bit high for the first set I bought and then the shipping went down on the second set even though they both came USPS.
2,"Good for noses, not for bottoms",These wipes are too thin and rough for sensitive bottoms. They're also a bit too small and I find I have to use more than one to get my little one's bottom clean after she goes number two. They've gotten quite pilled and I think they're getting rougher and rougher with each wash. We only use them for wiping noses now. They're definitely not as cushy and soft as they look in the picture.
1,Very disappointed,"I ordered these as the picture looks really good - I was so disappointed when I received them, they look like dust cloths! They aren't white, they are a horrible yellowish color and look disgusting. Very thin and useless. I do not know how someone can be so dishonest."
3,"Thin, but do the job","I wanted to try another brand of wipes, and I'm not 100% pleased with these. I'll admit, I was lured by the price (I bought them on another site for a better price than Amazon). They are very thin and shrink considerably during the first laundering. They tend to stick to the diaper pieces in the dryer and don't spread out/open easily once placed in the diaper wipe solution and wrung out. I wind up trying to use two hands, but anyone with small children knows that won't work. So, I wind up trying to shake the wipe open with one hand - and I get drips of solution everywhere. On the positive side, they are soft, and do the job. I haven't owned them long enough to figure out if they fray or not. Once they do, I'll probably toss them. Personally, I prefer something thicker and our favorite brand is GroVia. They are a little more expensive, but time and efficiency are precious commodities!I won't buy these again and I wouldn't recommend them."
2,Scratchy,I bought these and another type from a small business on the web. These are much much more scratchy. Maybe I am not using enough water when I wipe but I feel like they irritate her skin. They also frayed after just 1-2 washes. I am going to spring for the Charlie Bannana wipes. (The other type I bought are soft but they have a dark print on them which is annoying because you can't see what you've wiped.)
2,Too thin!,"I purchased these wipes because of the price. The fabric is much too thin and not very soft. I have the bum genius wipes and they are wonderful! I wouldn't waste the money on these wipes, spend the extra and purchase the bum genius brand!"
2,Not happy with these wipes,"These wipes are only one layer thick which makes them super thin and difficult to clean much of anything up without getting your hands all nasty. I prefer 2 ply wash clothes for cloth diapers!! These are perfect, however, in the bathroom in place of toilet paper."
2,Linty Butt!,"These wipes are nice and soft, however after 5 or 6 washes they start to leave a lot of lint on my baby's bottom! Not very happy with that! It took about 2 months of 2x week washings to get all the lint out. I like my two-sided BabyKicks better."
1,not so good,"I bought these last year and was very dissappointed, they are just so thin you need like three of them to get the job done. They wear out so quickly due to the thin material, do yourself a favor spend an extra couple of dollars and buy some good wipes. These are not the bargain they appear to be."
3,they're okay...,These wipes work ok but I feel like they are a bit too rough. I am currently looking for something softer.
5,Who knew a little square fabric would do so much!,"I thought that cutting and reusing an old receiving blanket was enough for a cloth wipe... Two days later, there was wipe leftover everywhere (including baby's little butt). I know I know, you just sew the edges to prevent this... but really... I have NO time! (And if I had, I'd rather spend it doing one of the million things us NYC working moms do every day). Then I bought these wipes. They are awesome. I use a home made cloth wipe solution on a peri bottle and use as needed. I find the more I wash these wipes, the more absorbent they get. I've used them for 2 months, and I haven't seen a stain yet. Note that I soak them before washing, and I use rockin green detergent on a hand-operated washing machine (Wonder Wash). The wipes dry really fast!"
2,Pretty bad wipes,"I'm really surprised by all the positive reviews for these wipes... I wonder if the reviewers haven't tried other brands? I've tried probably 10 different brands of cloth wipes and I have to say these are (by far) the worst of the them all. They feel like wet paper towels - super thin, not very soft, not very absorbent and irritating to my baby's skin. I'll keep these for cleaning his face and hands but I'll be sticking with BabyKicks and Thirsties wipes from now on."
2,Fair at best,"I ordered 3 packs of cloth wipes to compare - grovia, imsy vimsy, and osocozy. The grovia, by far were the nicest wipes and the most economical. These wipes are cheap, thin, and flimsy. Grovia is thick and absorbent, perfect for wiping messy bums. Don't waste your time and money here...go buy the grovia ones."
2,"Great price, not a great product.","I wish I had spent a little more money on something nicer. The edges are already starting to fray after a month of use. This material gets pretty rough when wet, so it's not good for wiping sensitive baby bottoms. I wish that I hadn't bought these! Do not be swayed by the good deal! It's a waste of money."
5,great wipes!,These are great! super soft for baby's delicate skin and they wash great. I have 30 of these and fold them so they pop up like disposable wipes.
2,Softness Doesn't Last,"I loved these wipes when we first got them. We exclusively cloth diaper, and they were such a wonderful complement to our diapering routine. Now that our son is three months old, however, these wipes have gotten coarse and rough. They're so rough, in fact, that I had to order a different, softer brand. I wish I had invested in something softer from the start and saved myself this expense."
2,Got pilly from washing,"When I got these, they were so soft and fuzzy for baby's skin. But after a month of use, they were so pilly and rough. They were irritating by baby's bum. I've decided to use them for other things, like blowing my nose and wiping up spills, so they haven't gone to waste. However I'm still bummed that they weren't good for what I bought them for. I guess if your little one's skin doesn't get irritated easily, then great, otherwise, I'd be wary."
2,Lots of fraying...,"As a cloth diapering mom, I wanted to also use cloth wipes. I decided to purchase two sets of these rather than sew my own.That was a mistake.The cute colorful threads that are around the border of each cloth wipe are FRAYING. After just one wash, they started coming apart.I do like the size of them and how they feel. I can fit them in a wipe container that once contained disposable wipes, but the fact that they are falling apart is quite disappointing.Overall, I would not recommend these wipes unless they change how they sew around the border of them."
4,"Decent idea, a few flaws","These are great sized squares to use for wipes. They are also cute. They do what they need to do when you wet them with a wipe solution (or just water). However, the serge on the edges... after a few weeks of washing, it frays. And, the unbleached ones seem less absorbent than the bleached ones, and tend to stain easier. Other than that, these do well in my cloth wipe rotation. (As another reviewer pointed out, you may want to price compare with the shipping added in, but these did the trick IMO)"
3,Not as thick as I hoped,"The thickness of these wipes is like a low quality flannel shirt. I was hoping they would be a little more substantial. The disposable wipes I used before (Huggies) are a little thicker than these. However, they are nicely made, and work OK."
2,Not very satisfied,"I got two packs of these because for 30 wipes $20 is pretty awesome. First wash they were no longer very soft and the seam on a few of them came off. Second wash, more seams came off. Pretty disappointed, I could have cut my own flannel if all I wanted were frayed squares of fabric."
4,Decent wipes,These are the better wipes that I have. They are good overall. I gave them 4 stars because they could be softer and because a few of the stitching has start to unravel.
4,Do the job.,I ordered two packs of these. I use them in the Prince Lionheart wipe warmer. They fit fine. I wash and dry in the laundry on high heat with no problems. I would recommend them.
4,Great wipes,"I have used cloth diapers on my daughter for almost 6 months now, but just finally decided to switch to cloth wipes. I read numerous reviews before decided on these, and I am very happy with my purchase so far. I purchased 2 sets, a total of 30 wipes, which is more than sufficient. I wash my diapers every other day, and just toss these in my diaper bin with the diapers and wash them all together. I definitely could have only purchased one set; although it is nice to be able to always have several stashed in the diaper bag. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because after the first wash, some of the colored thread around the edges came unraveled. I now wash and dry everything on the delicate cycle and haven't had any further problems. The wipes are so soft and my little girls bum couldn't be happier. I use my own wipes solution that I soak the wipes in, then ring out, and then place in the wipes warmer; in which they fit perfectly. Very happy, and saving so much money!"
3,Good for the price.,These wipes fit nicely in a travel wipes box. But they need to be premoistened for use. I typically wet my wipes individually as needed. These wipes do not readily absorb water so wetting takes alot of effort. They work wonderfully if you use a wipe solution to soak all of your wipes and store them.
3,Not the Best in the World,"These wipes were ok for a little while, they're nice and soft and it's great that they can just go in the wash with my son's diapers. However, they are thin enough that they just fold up on themselves in the dryer. I barely have the time to wash/dry and put them away, I definitely don't have the time to iron them as well. They're great for wiping up little things, but I'm getting several packs of wipes from Imse Vimse that are just as soft, but thicker fabric for diaper duty."
2,Not Good If Wet Or Washed,"I'm giving these wipes 2 stars only because if you'd like to use them dry, they're very soft and a great price. I use them as baby wipes as my son is allergic to any other prepackaged baby wipes with the exception of the Earth's Best. Those are expensive so, I only use them when out of the house and I use wash cloths at home. At first glance, I LOVED these wipes as they SEEM super soft. After wetting them, they change IMMENSELY. They get even worse after being washed. I had to stop using them every day as they were rubbing my son's little bottom raw. In addition to all of that, after only 4 washes about half of them are falling apart. So, if you're desperate for some filler wipes then go ahead although, I wouldn't suggest them for every day use on baby skin."
4,SPARTA!!,"Quite cool - I actually bought this for my 40-something husband. A child might get bored with this. Overall, it is larger than most action figures, and much more detailed. We haven't changed his face (comes with alternate face without mask) but it's cool that you can change the look. The voice is a little muffled since the speaker is under his cape (which almost feels leathery). He sounds the best when you aren't close so I recommend standing about 3-4 feet away and have someone else hit the voice button; he's easier to understand. I got a great price on this. Most online prices were $40, and that a little too much for this but definitely worth the great price I paid at AMOK Time."
5,Sensacional,"Muito bom o produto e a empresa que me vendeu também, a tisinc99. E o melhor de tudo é que eu comprei com carto internacional, entregaram na minha casa em So Paulo - Brasil e o Boneco + todas as taxas saíram por RS 120,00. O que é muito barato comparado ao preo dos importados daki.. (média de 300 Reais nas lojas. Muito bom. Recomendo a todos que tenham carto internacional"
4,Even better that I thought it would look,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it looks even cooler in real life than it did online. The cape is flexible and the head is interchangeable, both are nice features. My only complaint is how long it took to ship to us. The product itself is great though."
5,The Very Best Cole/Pike Book,"I own all of the Crais Elvis Cole books, and have read them all at least twice (except ""The First Rule"" which just came out).For depth of plot, character development, action and suspense, this is hands-down the best of them all.*** Small Spoiler ***Am I the only one who thinks Elvis should have dumped that schlub Lucy and gone with Samantha? She's the shyzz..."
4,Only one criticism,"This is my third Elvis Cole novel. I find them exciting, ""page turners"", with humor. They are well written and intersting. There is one thing that reall bothers me, the totally unnecessary and gratuitous profanity, particulary using Jesus name in vain, that really bothers me. Thanks"
4,Elvis Is Alive!,My favorite entry in the highly entertaining Elvis Cole series. The author takes a true leap in style and substance. It kept me enthralled tothe very last paragraph.
4,Riveting and intense.,"L.A. Requiem is by far the most intense and intricate of the Elvis Cole stories so far. What it lacks in the wit and charm of 'Free Fall' and the others it more than makes up for in a rich, complex and riveting story, which I could not put down til I finished. The friction between the characters we know and love is so well-crafted that it made me tense and worried for real. If you only like Elvis Cole for his wit and charm, skip this one, but if you like a well-spun story with twists, turns and intrigue to spare, make sure and ad this to your reading list."
4,Robert Crais,Robert Crais has done it again. This is a well written book and I did not want to put it down.
4,Glad to find me a new Auther,"Thia is my 3rd book of Robert Crais, and I liked that one as well. So added him to my favorite writers, which means another one to collect his books.I usually like the CIA-FBI type of book, wnd was glad to see some police good ones here."
3,His other books are better.,"It's a good book, but a little hard to get into. So many of the names are so close that it's hard to keep track of everyone. About halfway through it straightens out somewhat and gets better. I've read many of his other books that were definitely better."
5,Wonderful book by Robert Crais.,"Another wonderful book by Robert Crais. He has not let me down yet. I read all his books.Most successful writer when they get more famous, their work gets worse. This is not the case with Robert Crais, he keeps getting better."
4,LA Requiem,"LA Requiem is a gem. Interesting, intriguing, funny, well-written. It's not that I couldn't put it down, I didn't want to. I'm anxious for the next one!"
2,"Macho, macho man","I gave this book a fair try and after about 167 pages just gave up. I really didn't like any of these cardboard characters. I couldn't stand Joe Pike's strong silent type personia, the ex-Marine with a mean dad. And Elivs Cole, yeah, all the women are hot for him. This writer can't compare with Chandler and Elwood. It's an ok book but it's insulting to women and I thought it stunk. I knew right away who the culprit was, right away! I can't be fooled by this pulp. Hated it!"
3,OK,"Much of the book was quite good; I enjoyed the whole ""L.A."" setting. It was refreshing that what seemed like a good relationship (Elvis and Lucy) dissolved. The main objection(s) I had concerned the Joe Pike character. Come the heck on, I mean sunglasses all the time! It just seemed like yet another ""strong/mysterious/silent guy"" cliche. I found the sparse/clipped dialogue of Pike especially contrived and annoying. Further, the fact that Pike was so naturally adept at all things ""masculine"" and police oriented was rather pathetic. Then again, I did read the whole book, ..."
1,"A Rare, Bleak Misstep for Robert Crais & Elvis Cole","This is easily the bleakest Elvis Cole mystery to date. For some reason, Crais decided to substitute darkness for his usual levity, and subject the most likeable characters to various sorts of misery and suffering. Perhaps this is what someone might like to read if they want to feel depressed (or if they hate Elvis, Pike, and Lucy). But this is not what one reads Crais for! His other books are witty and fun, and do not beat up too much on the good guys.LA REQUIEM has plenty of pedophilia, child abuse, and many other bad things happening to good people. What it does not have is entertainment value, any sense of hope, or the humor we've come to expect from Crais. Pass this up, and try an earlier Crais."
2,"Great, except for the ending","The story was one of those rare ones that pulls you in and makes you hate to stop reading for meals, sleep, etc. But something happened at the end, like it was thrown together at the last minute. A very unsatisfying conclusion."
2,"Dead, dead, dead...","This book is cheap, slow and boring...Like a bad hollywood movie, it's filled with flat characters and has no real style at all.Nothing creative, new, surprising or engaging...For amazing popular literature, there's the one and onlyELMORE LEONARD...the great LEE CHILDand others like STEPHEN KING (not my favorite, but a great writer nonetheless)"
3,A Good Read But ...,"Robert Crais has done better. One problem I have with his books is strictly a book layout/style point. I have a very hard time reading entire chapters in italic print. I forgot I'd have to deal with that before I bought this book. Afraid I won't be buying any more of his books if that style continues.Overall, I did enjoy the story."
5,As Good As It Gets,"I have now read two Robert Crais novels in the Elvis Cole series. The first one, Monkey in a Raincoat and this one, the most recent. For my money, there is little to compare them. I found his first effort to be pretty thin porridge, but enjoyable. This one is a real story. A true whodunit for much of the book with many interesting subplots and characters. A book you hated to put down and looked forward to being able to get back to it. There are characters you can learn to hate and characters you root for. While the first Elvis novel was heavy on trying to be funny, this one is high grade raw meat and as serious as a heart attack. Others have detailed the book's storyline. My message is that if you are looking for one of the best books written in this genre in a long time, give it the ""One Click"" and get ready for some interesting reading!"
4,L.A. Requiem,"I enjoyed ""L.A. Requiem"" so much that I am reading ""The Watchman"", and I purchased ""The Sentry"" which I'll probably start reading in a couple of days. The characters Elvis Cole and Joe Pike make a smart team of detectives. I can visualize the Hollywood, Santa Monica and Eagle Rock neighborhoods. Joe Pike is exciting, edgy, yet cool. I will continue to read Robert Crais books because they are action packed and entertaining. I don't want to stop reading, because I have to know what's going to happen next. I read a book that is and has been on the New York Times best sellers list for several weeks and I was so disappointed. L.A. Requiem was a much better book than the one on the best sellers list. It makes me wonder."
3,Heavy and dark; not light and friendly Elvis,"You could tell this is an ""important"" book for Crais, but it's not necessarily the best one. Elvis is generally much lighter than this heavy, dark installment. Plus, E. has girl troubles that you see coming, then you just know how they're going to end. I love the Crais/Elvis Cole books, but jeez, lighten up!"
3,I don't think so....,"L.A. Requiem has about every formula of detecting and police procedure in the last 30 years--all in one book! I mean, I don't even want to name them, they are so familiar and boring: and this string of carbon copies don't have any redeeming features, either. These Pattern People are pasted into a predictable plot line and mounted in a collage of scenes from the Los Angeles we all know and love--windy roads, bad traffic, smog, slimy characters, and corrupt cops.Guess the only reason I gave the book three stars is that I like the flashbacks...that technique relieves the screaming boredom to a small extent.Read the earlier books of Robert Crais. Skip this one."
4,Reread,"Enjoying Crais as an author in the past, felt this offer a good one to reaquaint myself and see if I wanted to follow him into the creation of a new character in his latest release. Worth reading again and I purchased the latest release for my Kindle. Still look forward to additions in the Cole/Pike series'."
4,Excellent writer,I have found a new author and I will read all of his books. Love both Elvis and joe. Thanks
4,"good cops, bad cops and misbehavior in L.A.","I picked up L.A. Requiem, like so many people, at any airport before boarding a flight. Although the amazon.com reviews were favorable I feared somewhat that this would be one of the many vaguely competent yet forgettable popular crime novels. So how did the book measure up? Thankfully, rather well.The story is about serial killings in LA-LA land, with a pair of private investigators out to solve these murders. Things get very sticky when one of these investigators, a former cop, is implicated. Crais does a fine job in delivering a fast pace, complete with rather unpredictable story. It is certainly a page-turner.However the story has a somewhat familiar feel, resembling more a movie script than literature. The characterizations are a bit two-dimensional, the prose is marginally adequate. While L.A. Requiem is certainly not a classic it certainly rises above the ""forgettable"" status.Bottom line: an enjoyable crime novel. Recommended."
3,Good read,"Good readGOOD READ FAST PACED, RECOMMEND YOU GIVE IT A TRY YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTEDVERY GOOD BOOKG"
5,YAFECN: Yet Another Fantastic Elvis Cole Novel,"An excellent novel.Elvis is a realist, an investigator; hope and bleak experience and love and an attempt at understanding the world all are encompassed in his insights and wisecracks.This novel is better even than it sounds. Buy it now. Buy two and read one in a tub while allowing the other copy to soak in the tub with you in an attempt at osmotic awesome transfer."
4,The Dynamic Duo,"As usual, Joe Pike and Elvis are in trouble and handling it beautifully. These two can handle anything.....and with aplomb and humor."
2,"mediocre, you get what you pay for","fortunately i didnt pay much for this.it steals the altec lansing look, but definitely not the sound.Bass - severely lacking.treble - too tinnyat the loudest volume, with ipod turned all the way up, it still is pretty weak. it'll be useful for some music when i'm out doing some yard work but otherwise it's not very attractive for true listening purposes."
5,I love it!,"Well I bought 12 sentry speakers, I love the sound quality and the perfect laptop design its very confortable to travel and its very very good for that pricee... buy it"
2,No power cord!,Bought these for use in my sons bedroom. There was no power cord included. I had I known this I would have bout another product. I then had to order a cord and wait for it to ship. Dissatisfied. The sound is ok. As long as you don't want too much volume.
3,speakers,"I didn't realize that this didn't charge my Ipod so although this is a neat little speaker for listening to audio book tapes, I returned it."
1,Cheap costs you more in the long run,I bought this and I'm sorry. It sounds horrible. Don't waste your money because you'll just have to buy another one anyway for any true enjoyment. This crap is barely good enough for my bathroom.
4,"Saturday Night Live in Roswell, New Mexico","The strength of this book lies in the hysterical premise that extraterrestrial biological lifeforms/aka ""little green men"" are really a government invention that - regrettably - sold like hotcakes to legions of sociopathic ""believers"" the government wishes would just go away. Scripting the screenplay will be a hoot! Oh, and Kudos to the cover design!"
5,Fabulously vivid description of life in the nation's capital,As someone with a very short attention span and a plethora of unfinished novels on my bedside table it says quite a lot for Mr. Buckley that I could not put this book down! It was great! I noticed that none of the other reviewers so far have been from Washington D.C. so I just wanted to tell you all how vivid his descriptions of the city are! I could picture everything happening as I was reading it! Especially the part on Roosevelt Island... I went to day camp there when I was 10! Excellent book and I look forward to reading others by Christopher Buckley.
2,Hardly biting satire,"I am far from an expert on political satire, but I found Little Green Men tepid at best in its attempt to poke fun at the D.C. establishment.The opportunity to mock the self-important detail that Tom Clancy provides in his books is lost here.As far as political satire goes I will stick with my good friend, Al Franken."
4,Well worth the price of admission,"This is my first foray into Buckley's novelistic oeuvre. In this book, his humor is erudite and incisive, and he nails perfectly the oscillating gargantuan/craven personality make-up of the Washington politico and his Mini-Me, the ""media wonk."" I found the characters and dialogue ideal vehicles for the highly spirited farce the book purveys.This novel is something of a cross between Dave Barry's ""Big Trouble"" and Tom Wolfe's ""Bonfire of the Vanities."" Buckley does to the Washington Establishment what Barry does to the mixed up milieu that's South Florida and Wolfe to Wall St.'s Masters of the Universe. This book is more urbane than Barry's but less ""literary"" than Wolfe's.I found the plot a bit harder to follow in the second half than in the first. All in all, though, the book's an exceedingly well-written yet funny and easy read."
2,Rotten Little Green Men,"The summary of this book and all the reviews that i read made me think that i was in for a real treat. i was wrong, this book was an incredible dissappointment. i should have known from the over descriptive first sentence."
2,FOUGHT TO GET THROUGH IT,"I read Christopher Buckley's ""Thank You for Smoking"" and loved it! Brilliant. So I ordered ""Little Green Men"" thinking it would be equal. Maybe it just wasn't my cup of tea. I had to keep talking myself into going back and reading it, thinking at some point, it would kick in. It never did for me. Nonetheless, I am going to try ""Florence of Arabia."" I think that might be more in line with my tastes. I love good satire and Chris is generally considered the best. I just finished reading a great book of satire about the celebrity news media, ""The Wizards of Spin,"" and loved it. I hope the author John Ruane continues to write books of satire. It was wonderful!"
