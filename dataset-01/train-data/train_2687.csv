5,You On A Diet Workout,This is a fabulous book even for those who don't need to lose weight. Lots of helpful information and you learn about the body and how food can affect it.
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,Do not buy this DVD. The poorest excuse for an exercise program I have ever seen and I have been working out for over 30 years. The instructor cannot even keep count of the repetitions and you end up exercising on side more than another plus the exercises themselves are not well thought out. Just a very poor product.
2,Not what I expected,"This DVD workout is more like a very basic strecthing video or something. Nothing to exercisey about it. Maybe it is just me, but i like to move and increase movement on more advanced levels, but this just adds another move, instead of any intensity...the best i can use to describe this is ""Boring""""...Nothing i would stick to at all...Blah!!"
3,Workout,"This workout is actually strenuous. I was pleasantly surprised, considering the price (cheap). I enjoy it. The trainer is a bit annoying, but I get annoyed when I am being told to do it again--only longer."
3,Good but too fast,"This is a good quick workout routine, but at times it's too quick. I think they were trying to hard to keep it at 20 minutes. I'm still getting into position and they're on rep 2 already. And Joel cheats on the counts (adding more reps) which is annoying. But it shows you how to do the exercises in the book and it's easier than looking at the book. It could use more visuals on proper positioning.Because it's short, good full body workout (for us lackies), I trust Dr's Oz and Rosen and it's cheap I would recommend it."
3,"Nice, but use caution.","These are okay introductory workouts -- apparently just what the doctors ordered -- but should have more attention to form and safety. For example, parts of the routine require you to balance standing on one foot. The very thin instructors do this bare-foot and do not say anything about foot or ankle support. I am quite heavy; after doing this workout, barefoot as shown, only a few times I developed what may have been a stress fracture in one foot that took several weeks to disappear. I have no medical training, but I suggest athletic footwear if you are a heavier person."
4,Life changing,I loved ideas in this book as far as eating habits. It gets confusing to read at times for my English as a second language. I may have lost something in the translation of the jokes/tone in the book. Otherwise the idea behind it is great and it works awesome.
1,You on a diet workout dvd,This is the second one that I purchased and it has the same problems as the first:DVD makes cracking soundsSTOPS in the middle of work outunfortunately i did not take the time to send back and want to pay postage again.I am a huge DR. OZ fan and have many of his books and items.This one bombed out!!! If you get it right would love to have.R haynes
4,Totally toned me up,"I absolutely love this workout. Its so short and easy but you feel a great workout. It really works the areas that need to be worked out and it toned me beautifully. I lost my DVD and just purchased another one. After having 2 kids, you would never know. The guy who does the workout is really annoying and thats the only down side."
3,You On a Diet Workout ---not for beginners,"The workout was too hard for me so I purchased an easier one to start with. I love the book ""You on a Diet"" and the recipes are great. I lost 14 pounds and 6 inches."
5,Great Book,This is a very informative book and the dvd is something my husband and I do each morning.
4,You on a Diet Workout,"It only works if you have time to read it! I have yet to really but this to good use, but it seems easy enough."
2,You Workout DVD Does Not Work Properly,"I beleive the workout DVD would be excellent; however, the DVD, brand new out of the box skipped and jumped and the sound quality was extremely poor. It was not my DVD player because I tried it in several players including my laptop, all with very poor sound and visual quality. I would have enjoyed this DVD in addition to the manual I purchased had it worked properly. I need to make arrangements for a return, but I haven't had the time to package the item for return."
1,Sorry to say this...,"I have ordered many things from Amaazon & always been happy, but on this particular purchase I am not. I NEVER RECEIVED IT! I have sent many emails regarding this & have gotten no help!"
2,Very Disappointed,"Just purchased the PM 2000. Started putting it together and found both extension wings have a .010"" belly in them. The beveled edges of the extensions wings don't match the main table bevel. The carriage that rises and lowers the saw doesn't work. Very Very disappointed. This will be the only powermatic tool I will ever purchase. I would take a Grizzly over this thing any day. JWV."
3,A cautionary tale,"This pretty much does everything as advertised. Guitar itself fairly good quality as a ""starter"" piece. The included amp is basically a toy, though. Sound is barely audible. If you have a VISTA operating system, your PC likely will hedge on installing the needed drivers, so you will need to tell your PC to accept drivers from an unverified source. Advice: This is not for a person with no experience playing a guitar. The trial ""amp modeling"" software is very complex; you will have 30 days to choose one of three from the Behringer web site. Make sure you register ASAP. Also, mine came shipped in a box that was obviously opened and re-sealed (likely a return). Everything seemed in order and the guitar did not appear damaged. However, the USB cable interface (advertised as INCLUDED) was MISSING. I was forced to purchase a $10 cable from a local Radio Shack since this was a Christmas gift and I did not want to hassle with returning the huge box to Amazon. A little disappointing."
2,no way to search kindle because it does not show page numbers like index.,I was disappointed. The book is needed for a school project and I could not find the page numbers when I looked in the index. It only had location up to 16000.
1,Save your time until Carson can do this better...,"I have to laugh when I read other reviers fawn over Carson's attention to detail in this book. Carson definitely has a reputation for good scholarship, but the short section that I read in this book (about two pages that summarily dismissed Stanley Hauerwas on the basis of a very selective reading of one of his lesser known and less directly theological books) showed me that Carson has a long way to go before he (along with almost every other evangelical I have ever read, with the exception of a few who actually make a good faith effort to understand the intellectual issues of the day like Stanley Grentz and Rodney Clapp) can even begin to even understand ""postmodernism,"" presumably the subject of this book."
5,chuck is awesome,"I have watched all season three of chuck and have to say it is the most awesome season yet-keeps getting better and better in my opinion. Just when I thought it may be close to running its course, they come up with the greatest story lines and clever writing. The cast is incredible and loveable. I did like Hannah too-not for Chuck of course-has to be ultimately Sarah."
3,The Writing Took a Step Down - Not as Good as Seasons 1-2,"I have to say, the episodes are rather unappealing in the beginning. The relationship between Chuck and Sarah is awkward and nonexistent in the first 5-6 episodes. Also, there is no humor to be found. Without Adam Baldwin, this show would struggle. He's the sole source of comedy here. Nevertheless, the writing drastically improves towards the last 5-6 episodes. Although, it is evident that the writers grasped for ideas to transition into season four. I still love Chuck, but I am hoping season four has much more to offer as far as comedy goes."
4,Great Show - Great Characters - Wrong Price,"I love this show, I'm glad it's being renewed for a 4th season! I hate that feeling I get in April when I hear it's about to be canceled! :( However, Universal needs to make this disc more affordable. The season was shorter than previous seasons, and the storyline was not up to par! Stop being greedy, and make the prices for your disc's fair so we can all afford them!"
2,Still not loving the new season of Chuck!,"This episode made no sense! Why are they trying to make Chuck something he's not! Why are they trying to hook Sarah up with superman? He sucked as superman, what makes them think he would make a good spy? It looks like they are getting rid of the girl from smallville. Thank God!!! Come on people, get it together or I AM OUT!!!"
2,The destruction of a character,"I was totally hyped for this season. I'd watched both season one and two and was excited for this new season.That lasted until it started and I was devastated. This wasn't the Chuck and Sarah from the previous seasons. These characters were so different that I didn't like them at all.This went on until episode 13 when Chuck started to be Chuck again. In the mean time however I saw the character of Sarah get totally butchered. Some people call that growth. I call it crappy writing.Not everything is bad and there are some very good episodes this season. But after having seen this season, I'm not such a big fan of the show as I was before seeing it."
3,Season 3 Is Boring,"I watched Chuck every week but Season 3 was just terrible. Actually, right after Clark Kent (Brandon Routh) joined the show, everything went down to the drain. Chuck used to be fun to watch. Everyone of us were Chuck one way or other who was just nobody. Chuck just wanted to be Chuck. Superman turned the show upside down completely. Chuck wanted to be someone else now. Boring!There was some fun moment but the focus was all on Clark Kent in Season 3. Who cared what Superman could do?"
1,"bad,bad,bad",this is not a god season i love chuck ses 1 and 2 butt this ses 3 is just crap hoping ses 4 gets better
5,Witty and Inventive,"I'm so glad they didn't cancel Chuck, because we never would have gotten to this season, which in many ways is the most development of character and drama we get. I'm glad Amazon has these episodes! A must-watch for those who enjoyed the first 2 seasons!"
4,Chuck: The complete Third season,"The actor and actress of Chuck: The Third Season are still having the same standard as before. For Zachary Levi, he's good at doing stupid acts during those cases. For Yvonne Strahotski, she's the one with beauty and also a good action actress througout the stories."
5,Great deal,"I was so excited to find this for such a great price. It came very quickly and has been working well, so far. I would definitely buy from this seller again."
3,Not as good as before,"The fun thin g with the previous seasons of Chick was that the hero was a nerd caught up in a world of espionage that he did not control. Here however he has become a real spy and that does ruin the fun for the first part of the season which is simply much less fun. Indeed, the whole thing is no longer that fun or even credible as Chuck becomes a savvy spy. However the whole thing does improve at about mid-season and then becomes quite n ice to watch again."
5,Keeps getting better!,"Chuck keeps getting better every season! This one especially really demonstrates why Chuck is such a great show. They're not afraid to keep evolving and moving forward. So many shows have grown stale after just a few seasons because they are afraid to change! The characters in this season continue developing and growing while still maintaining their original personalities. It's truly a show full of wonderful talent on all fronts. Never short on humor, while still bringing action and the appropriate amount of romance, Chuck never fails to satisfy my craving for some good TV."
2,"Poor quality, breaks easily","We bought two pairs of these glasses and use them frequently but carefully. Once the lenses have been switched a few times, the frame cracks. It happened with both pairs."
2,Very Disappointing,"EPICS is very disappointing. It is nowhere up to the usual standards of the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra. The recordings are harsh and just too showy. There is no heart, only might and if these are supposed to be epics, what is MINORITY REPORT doing there?"
5,Going far!!,"I first saw Christine performing in San Francisco on Fisherman's Wharf. I bought her 5 song cd then and was not only mesmerized by her live performance but the demo was beautiful! I have since bought Little Lighthouse, her full cd. Christene not only has the voice of an angel but she is a natural storyteller. Her songs are like mini novels. She is incredibly sweet and while my family and I were listening to her, she sang a special song to my 4 year old daughter.I highly recommend this cd and anything Christine puts out."
4,"dog loves it, but I have to watch him","My Amstaff loves this toy, but as with many toys I have to watch him. If left alone with it he works on where the loop is joined and pulls the threads apart. Other than that it's a great tug toy and he likes to rapidly swing his head so that he literally beats himself up with the ball!"
1,Highly Destructible,"I made the mistake of leaving my dog alone with this thing for 10 minutes, and she tore it to shreds. If your dog likes to chew on things, this will be destroyed in a day."
1,Pamphlet Review,This is a pamphlet containing reprints originally published by the U.S. Army Research Institute. It deals with operational concerns and not tactics or techniques. The printing quality was so poor that several pages were barely readable with a couples pages unreadable.P. st.Clair
2,It could have been better..,"This is another one of those compilations that could have better, i mainly bought this cd cuz of the Frankie Bones songs, but also bought it for 'Red Alert' by Tech Vo. There is also a 4:04 min song, House Of God by D.H.S. I have a shorter version of the song which is on 'Order to Dance III' which is probably outdated & hard to find. The House of God on this cd sounds a bit better & has more then the 'Order To Dance III' version. Im unsure if this version was used in mixes b4 i only remember the shorter version being played in megamixes on b96 (chicago). ""Chemical Reaction"", as well the rest of the tracks on the album are fine, but could have been better. The Frankie Bones songs on here are pretty good tho!I have yet to go through the megamix still but i wouldnt hold your breath. Unless i hear songs i like on the megamix i probablly wont write a seperate review on why its worth to get."
4,superb,"Wow - to hear this is a great experience! I mean the Panina - especially ""piteously moans the autumn wind"""
5,Really nice dog beds,"I have four of these for my dogs and really like them. The are cozy and are easy to wash and dry, and they last for years. I use two (one on top of the other) for my dogs for more cushioning, which works really well. It's also easier to wash two of these at home instead of going to the laundramat to wash a big pillow type bed. And the cats like them too!"
4,Nice,Thinner than I thought but very soft! I put a few pillows under it and the animals love it. Would purchase again
4,Learned two tunes,"I was taking lessons at the time, and frustrated since my instructor had a tendency to teach songs all out of order and we never really played any songs from beginning to end. I borrowed this tape from a friend. I was playing the first two songs fairly quickly. The only problem was playing the tape over and over and writing out the chords. Forgot to see if this tape comes with a book. That'd help a lot! Not sure you could learn these songs with out previous guitar knowledge. Some of the fingerings are a little tricky. Well they were for me! LOL I only had a few months of lessons, but Building a Mystery sounded decent within a shorter time than expected. :)'4 stars if you already know some guitar, but not a first time learners video. Again better if it has a book."
5,The best replacement speakers for my 1995 Jeep Wrangler,"i was looking for replacement speakers for my 1995 Jeep Wrangler YJ roll bar unit. Once installed, my speakers looks & sounds excellent. Satisfaction. Thanks!!!"
4,Great speakers for Porsche Boxster,"I cut out my old speakers and remounted these bad boys in my Boxster along with a Pioneer DEH-4400HD CD Receiver with Built in HD Radio. The speakers sounded great on the standard receiver, but I saw major improvements with the pioneer receiver (HD Radio is amazing!). The speakers sound awesome and are very loud for a 4"". On the other hand the bass doesn't sound good at all with settings turned up, but that is to be expected with this size. The bass is nice enough as long as you're not cranking the settings up. I would highly recommend this speaker if you are forced to a 4"" like myself or have an amp and a sub to handle the bass. The speakers really do sound great, all my friends were impressed :)."
5,Good sound for their size,"These speakers perfectly fit the space allocated for my stock speakers. A larger speaker would've been nice, but these are a great compromise. You will not be disappointed!"
1,Buzzing already,"I hate to be the naysayer, since there were so many other awsome reviews - but we bought approx 4 months ago, and we already have a serious buzz/vibration. So disapointed since 4 months is too long and they won't credit the return:( Maybe we just got a bad pair. Too bad for us."
1,HORRIBLE!!,I bought these a while back and they sound HORRIBLE! i thought they would make my sound 10x better but sadly they didnt i contact polk and they say they dont allow this seller to sell there products why?...because the speakers are supposivly come with a bass check..meaning theres something missing from the speakers thus concluding that this is a bad seller sadly i do need the speakers so im holding on to them.. my 5.25 stock sound better thanthese do not recommend these speakers trust me there a hassle and not worth your time..and money...
3,The Frist Chapter?,"Just want to point out that Amazon has this in their listing:""9. Vagilante Man (Incidental) (Bonus Track)""It is not a snippet of a porn soundtrack, as one might assume from the typo, it is actually ""Swan Song: Vigilante Man"" written by Woody Guthrie."
3,Alicia has a bad day,"I bought this book for my granddaughter. She had taken it out of the library. I was very disappointed to receive it bent and wrinkled, especially since I had thought it was a hard cover book. I will not be purchasing books for her from the same source."
4,A little dissapionting...,"Ok, so I got the figure. I opened it up, thought everything was fine and dandy, and when I tried to bend it's abdomen joint, SNAP!!! It was finished in the blink of an eye. Kinda like the movie...Anyway, it is over all an OKAY figure, I wouldn't highly recomend it for just any one. It's more for display than actually play."
5,A cool toy by Ray Rinkes,It is cool but it could have had it`s mouth open. It comes with a stand and a human thing. I think it`s pretty cool.
3,"Not bad, not great either","On the whole this is a very typical `new age' release - not a genre I like very much. However, there is some good guitar work and interesting vocals in the first two or three tracks. Makes for nice listening. However, after that, it's pretty much downhill. Generally they start to sound the same, making it quite tiresome. If you like Kitaro I suppose you'll like ""Gaia,"" otherwise look elsewhere for good mood music."
4,Great Music,"I fell in love with Bolero as a teenager. True, this is only in mono with a bit of tape hiss, but considering that is was recorded in 1930, that isn't bad. This is the way he wanted it played."
1,new? yeah sure,"i just got my spy sunglasses bianca grape fade-merlot fade...when i got the package, the box wasnot even big enough for the size of the sunglasses so the box inside was all messed up, i opened then and they were the wrong color....turning rto transparent unthe bottom and then red....then i was checking the out and they were crocked and scratched...it seems he broke it and grued them together....what a rip off...dont ever get stuff from this seller..."
2,Funeral Planning - Is this really a kit?,"I have to agree with another reviewer of this book that this not a ""kit"", but simply a book with guidelines for planning a funeral. The book leaves out many important factors necessary to make good funeral planning decisions. The author is very qualified in his field and based on that I would have expecetd a better book."
3,No disk included!,"This not a ""kit"", but simply a book with guidelines for planning a funeral. I sent it back and received another copy---no disk included in that one, either! So, buyer beware.The book seems to be very helpful and practical and I would recommend it on that."
5,Really Great Program,"I bought a Canon PowerShot and wasn't thrilled with the software I got free. Very limiting. So I got Photo Impact Pro, and it's just head and shoulders above what I had. I could spend months and still not uncover all the cool features in there ... it's just overwhelming the number of things you can do. But at the same time it's very easy to use. I'm a retired machinist with only 18 months experience even using computers, and it's a cinch for me ... so that says a lot. :-) A friend of mine turned me on to Photo Impact - a guy in our users' group - and he says it's more sophisticated than Photoshop Elements (the other program I was considering). From what I can see, he's right. I use Photo Impact to edit and print the photos I take. And I've added captions and some effects. Haven't made a CD slideshow yet, but I expect to. I hope this review is helpful to you. I don't think you can go wrong with this program."
3,Teaching a teacher is always difficult!,"After working with PhotoImpact Pro 8.5 for over 6 months I have decided that it is much smarter than this education specialist. I have been a photographer for over thirty years, am computer literate and considered a better than average math teacher of over 18 years, but this program is more difficult to master than any secondary school child could ever be :) I purchased PhotoImpact thinking that it would replace my Adobe Photo Deluxe edition, Picture it, and two other simple digital photo programs. I am somewhat disappointed but do not plan on giving up. I am going back to ""school"" after having this program sit on the shelf from frustration and hope to become a ""master"" graphics and photo developer by sheer determination."
4,very good cutter,Its good cutter.I did not rate it 5* 'cause sometimes it doesn't work with thick fabrics.
4,"Corny, but majestic and inspiring","Somewhat heavy handed, but inspiring at the same time, especially the vocals--great sing along tunes of heroism and triumph. A very enjoyable listen ! Not much like the ambient, electronic instrumentals commonly associated with Mr. Franke, but pick it up for a rousing good time..."
5,works great,"meter is cheap and compact, but it does the job, plus it's easy to useits a good meter.."
5,Great Product,I am very satisfied with this product. It works great. It was just what I was needing. I highly recommend it.
4,Great Little SWR meter,Good little meter for the CB hobbyist. Was a big help in tuning all my CB antennas.
3,quick shipment - hand made product not tested,"The FWD and REV switch was upside down, I noticed it after making silly mistakes by cutting my whip too short. I was trying to cancel my order but seller did not return my e-mails, that is the only reason I removed two star other that that the seller is great. Quick delivery."
4,Very prompt,"The book arrived early (always a +), in great condition. The book itself was more of a history lesson than anything. Many of the topics the author touched on, I had already learned in class. Some of the information was helpful, but I would have preferred a more uniformed approach. A lot of background information though as well as reiteration on what I learned in the past."
3,Focused like the title implies,"Gets you on your way with Java for these types of applications. First 1/3 of the book is redundant if you already know C well, since many of the operator rules are the same. I bought this book to teach myself, but can't seem to get the code from Prentice-Hall unless I am an instructor (or educator). Therefore, unless there is another way to get the packages that go with the book, then it deficient for the self-taught. I ended up using PtPlot instead of the Author's 2D plot code. Another problem is that the Swing windowing the book uses seems to be falling out of favor now."
1,I am not happy with this.,"Hello,I bought this book three times through Amazon and all three times I got a copy with printing smudges throughout the book. I let Amazon know and tried to get resolution through the publisher as well as Amazon. It was like beating my head against a wall. It is a little outdated as well. Java 1.4 is a little old. However, there is a need for this type book so I kept mine. But you have been warned.Thank You,Micah"
2,I wanted to learn JAVA,"While the title of this book promises to teach Java, instead it mostly teaches the reader how to use specialzed bits of code that the author wrote himself. The reason I bought the book was to learn JAVA, so I could write my own code. I suppose this book would be good for people who want to be able to write Java programs without learning how Java actually works."
3,Great Sound but for a Short Duration,"They do have great sound for the price you pay. The only problem is that they seem to only last for a short period of time. I have owned 3 pairs of these and they all seem to break around 3 - 5 months. In their defense, I workout with them on and beat them to death."
2,Solid bass sounds muffle mid- to high-range,"I purchased these headphones and returned them the next day. For some of my music they sounded okay; however, I don't have many songs that really feature the bass, so these headphones were not for me. For much of my music, I felt the focus these headphones place on providing a rich bass caused the mid to upper range, including vocals, to sound muffled. I prefer my music a little more crisp and present. For those whose music can use more bass, these may be the headphones for you, but for me, they weren't."
1,Terrible Quality & Customer Support,"I mainly use my headphones when working out & on the plane/train/bus. The sound is great and they do a good job of blocking sound, but they have terrible quality. I bought these headphones a year ago and they broke a 2 months later. The jack got separated from the wiring to the headphones. I then contacted customer service and it took numerous e-mails and about two months to get a replacement pair. The replacement pair lasted 5/6 months and then the jack got separated again. This also happened to my roommate's pair of Bass Freqs."
5,"FINALLY earbuds that aren't painful to wear, wonderful!!",The title of this review says it all. I've gone through too many earbuds to finally find a pair that don't fall out and don't hurt my ears. The original/standard iPod earbuds are too big as are all I've tried before. I have to push them in at an odd angle and can only stand them for 10 minutes at the most.These V-Moda earbuds are perfect for my apparenty small ear openings. I used the adapters that came with them out of the box and am now pain-free. The other adapters it comes with are way too large but it's great to have choices. I'm buying another pair in a different fun color for my laptop.
1,Cheap !,"These broke as I was taking them out of the package. Sent them straight back. Amazon, as always, great about it so no problem there - just a crappy product."
5,Blistering Goa trance at its finest,"Classic goa trance from one of the legends. Amazingly psychedlic intro and the other side is more pulsating trance. Own the world is possibly even better, with the ""own the world, you know that don't you"" voice is immense!!! An Oakenfold favourite too."
3,Good little unit for the price,"I purchesed my unit about a month ago. It's been with me ever since, and has held up remarkbly well, considering it's rather fragile appereance. The battery life is also pretty good, getting a few weeks instead of a few days like any other cd player. It's playing back of mp3's is also pretty good. Found nothing really to complain with there.If your looking for a sturdy-type cd/mp3 player, this one gets a recamendation from me..."
5,Excellent unit for the price,This little baby is perfect - forget all the others - regular price of $49.99 in the stores still makes this a great buy !!!
2,sux lasts 4 bout 1 week,ok i babyed this pile for 1 week smacked in new battries disk read error after 5 cd and a clean it wouldn't work buy at own risk skips so easy buy a RCA Sanyo Sony Colby anything im going SONY
2,It points out the flaws in the logic of the author.,"The first thing I noticed when I opened the book was the glossy pages. This is a technique used by publishing companies to persuade someone to buy a book. It gives the impression that this book is filled with magical answers. The second thing I noticed was that it had many words in bold print to grab your attention. It was a shameful dispaly of commercialism. Also, the best way to improve your life is to marry the right person. That is the book in a nutshell; or at least that is what it should be. Don't worry. That is not a crucial plot element as mentioned in the review guidelines. There are certain things mentioned to improve one's life that have absolutely no bearing to one's happiness. An example refers to a certain Occupation that I do not think is very spiritually productive at all. This book is a waste of money and I do not think amazon is wise to put it on its publishing list. The two stars I gave were for the art work on the cover."
2,"Only ""OK""","Yes powerful, but:-power buttons only work when pushed and *held* on; once released, blade stops (and they do need a rather hard push)-since it's a bit heavy, it's hard to hold and press those buttons at the same time-chopping container indicates level of contents it can hold; not very much...Because of the above, it's not used as intended...which translates to not very often.Look at some other models to compare the weight, etc. If you can't find one that has better properties for the price, my recommendation would be to spend the extra money for one that does."
2,Not happy with this blender,"I was given one of these blenders and have been REALLY unimpressed. The ""stick"" attachment won't stay in the handle part, so I have to hold it there to use it (like a previous reviewer pointed out... you have to hold down the power button, so that means I need two hands to operate the blender). The ""mini chopper,"" like a previous reviewer pointed out, doesn't hold much at all and I haven't found it very effective - I have to keep opening it up and shifting around the contents to get consistent chopping or mixing. I've had the darn thing for 3 years and I'm finally upgrading - I'm just sorry I ever owned the thing in the first place!"
1,Farberware Stick Blender a Dud,"I purchased a Farberware Stick Blender from Amazon. I had one before and just loved it. It comes with a chopper attachment, too. My purchase did not work (the stick part) so I returned it. Amazon promptly sent me another, per my request. I used it as a chopper to make soup, which was fine. But then, when I used it to MIX the soup, the stick blender jammed. Now I must make ANOTHER return. I am not happy. The same thing was wrong with both."
4,pretty good,"You should buy this cd more for the testing section than for the music. I found the music to be kinda lame, but the tests were alright.-moath"
1,skin doesnt fit the camera,"This skin is supposedly custom fit to the optio w30. But it isnt. I had to cut it to fit right, and the indentations for the controls are still not quite in the right place. Frustrating because bythe time I pay shipping to get it and then again to return it, the cost is increased quite a bit, which is why I decided to cut it and be frustrated with it rather than return it."
1,Poor quality,The texture and idea is great. The quality and ability to stand up to the littlest of useis really disappointing. It ripped and tore and was not usable within a very short time.I would not purchase this again .. without an extended warranty :)
2,OK but over-priced,"Dixon's book is a reasonable introduction to Northern Ireland politics, though a little superficial. It would be better suited to a highschool audience than to the serious student of the subject as it does not come to grips with the subtelties of the situation and has, in any case, been rather superceeded by events. At $75 it is definitely a little over-priced."
4,Northern Alliance Action Figure,At first glance this toy seems to resemble an Al-Qaeda military illegal enemy combatant; but the person depicted is actually a member of the Northern Alliance that fought to overthrow the Taliban government in Afghanistan. Figure includes an RPG-7 and a base plate for the figure to stand on. Details are very good although the poor molding on the face makes this figure a little offensive. Otherwise the figure is of good quality and represents the typical dress and weaponry utilized by the irregular forces of the Northern Alliance during the American invasion of Afghanistan.
3,"A decent keepsake for the ""Real World: Hawaii"" fans","The ""Real World: Hawaii"" show featured probably one of the most intriguing, exhibitionist and button- pushing cast there ever was and I was somewhat expecting the same ambiance in the book. Well, I was somewhat disappointed not to read any new and exciting information in there. Instead the book featured a lot of re-hashed information from the show along with the written confirmation of what the show's addicts had been suspecting all along. If you really enjoyed the show, this book will be an excellent keepsake. But if you are looking for some more exciting ""dirt"", look somewhere else."
1,Hyper-edited fluff--like the show,"This book is just another showcase for the self-absorbed cast to toot their own horns. Boring, and overly edited. Buy a good book instead."
1,Concept,"Gee, let's read about television because we can't watch it all day long or our eyes will fall out!"
1,Didn't make it through,"I tried on multiple occasions to finish watching this movie, but just couldn't do it. I suspect the actors would be perfectly great with both a better story and better direction. But unfortunately, I completely lost interest about halfway through."
1,TOO Big!!!,"I am really upset right now. I love this pattern and just bought these plates. Get them home and they won't fit in my cabinets or my dishwasher. :*( WHAAAAA! Maybe Pfaltzgraff will get a clue and make a smaller version of this dinnerware set. Until then, don't buy them."
2,Dinner Plates won't fit in dishwasher or upper cabinets!,"I searched for almost a year to find a new pattern of everyday dishes I liked. And I love the look of the Sedona pattern, and especially the centerpiece bowl and pitcher. But the huge 12"" dinner plates won't fit in my dishwasher, or in my upper kitchen cabinets! So I guess I will have to return all the pieces I received for Christmas and resume my search for a new pattern. I am so bummed!"
1,So Disappointed!,"Bought a service for 16 and many other accessory items. The dishes chip VERY easily. They are huge and barely fit in the dishwasher. I have alot of iron in my water and the dishes stain from it......not sealed, kind of makes me worry about bacteria under the glaze if water can get in. They also get extremely hot in the microwave......can't handle dishes or coffee mugs even if placed in microwave for a short time. I would not recommend this product. They are pretty to look at but not for long......half of my set is damaged. After spending over $500 I now need a new set of dishes. Very disappointing."
2,too big,"This set is beautiful but I still would not recommend it. Every thing about the set is way oversized. The dinner plates look like they could be meat trays, the mugs hold about 16 oz of liquid. It takes about 4 servings of cereal to fill the bowl.. so you see if you're watching your waistline or trying to maintain a ""girlish"" figure, this set is not for you.The set also takes up alot of room in my cupboards and in my dishwasher. Why did they have to make these so huge!?!"
3,HOT! HOT! HOT!,"The dishes are great, they look good, and the dinner plate is huge so watch your serving size! I'm very pleased with the set except for one thing... microwaving. The dishes get hotter than the food! Not sure what's causing this because upon arrival they worked fine. I thought it may be the microwave unit but it's not. All of our other microwavable items work just fine and are not hot to the touch. You can get burned taking these dishes out of the microwave - seriously. We always use some type of protection when we remove the plates or just use something else to heat the food. If it were not for this 'glitch' I'd have rated these dishes as a 5 star purchase."
1,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,This was a waste of money. There is only one tiny little retainer that holds the phone in place and it releases with very minimal pressure. After only a few minutes of examination I promptly tossed it in the trash.
2,phone falls out,"This holster was good for the first day or two, but after that if you don't have the clip TOTALLY locked in place, the phone will fall out..I do not recommend this holster at all for the Treo 700 to anyone. In less than five days my phone has fell out of the holster three times for no reason which has scratched the face all up now... I'm very frustrated what has happened to my phone because of this product."
3,Not-so-rubberized,"I have bought the Cellet Elite Rubberized Holster before. They usual last 3-6 months before I break them, but that's not really an issue, since they are cheap to replace. These particular holsters were more plastic-y that rubberized, which makes them not as nice (IMO). The price was great, shipping was a bit high. Net is 3 stars."
3,Cellet rubberized coated swivel belt clip,The belt clip is an ideal holster for my Palm Treo 650. The trouble is that the mechanism that holds the clip is not very strong and subject to breaking very easily. The part that holds the pin of the mechanism is not strong enough. With normal wear and tear that molded piece has broken 2 times and I had to replace the holster.
1,"HORRIBLE, RUINED MY PHONE!!!","I BOUGHT THE TREO 700WX, AND THOUGHT TO GET A HOLSTER THAT WILL PROTECT THE SCREEN, SAW THIS AND BOUGHT, WELL LITTLE DID I KNOW A TINY TINY PIECE OF PLASTIC IS THE ONLY THING HOLDING YOUR PHONE TO THE CLIP AND IF IT HAS AN OUNCE OF PRESSURE THE PHONE WILL FALL FROM YOUR WAIST. I BOUGHT MY TREO BRAND NEW AND NOW IT HAS SCRATCHES ON THE BODY... DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY EVEN THOUGH IT IS CHEAP, THERE IS A REASON WHY IT IS THIS CHEAP AND OTHERS THAT ARE OF EXCELLENT QUALITY THAT COST $20 MORE..."
3,Treo Clip Holder,"After about a week of use, the rubber that secures the phone into the clip wore out. I eventually bought a different case."
1,Disappointing,"I am a mythology nut, so when I saw this book I was very excited to read it. However, that all changed as when I purchased it, I found out that not only was it frighteningly small, but more than half of the book was blank. At first I thought there was just a fluke in printing, but I got ahold of another buyer who told me that his book was in the same condition. If you are looking for a interesting book on the lore and myth of this particular hellhound, this is not your book."
3,Waste,Waste of Money.books by herman gabor and Slaney & kak are better if one needs to study for PhDGood only for beginners!
3,The roots of Winter,"No, this isn't prime Winter and you won't find much of the blues rock that made him famous. Most of this is studio recordings from the early to mid 60's and covers a lot of stylistic territory. You can hear the young Johnny playing in a country band. Judging from these songs I'd say that Johnny was going for a sound somewhere between Roy Orbison and the early records by the Stones. There's also some great ""surf"" guitar playing here as well as some early blues recorded when Johnny and Edgar were still together. The third disc is a concert recorded in the late 60's and will sound very familiar if you've heard Johnny's live recordings from the 70's. The performances aren't as tight as on Johnny Winter And Live but the playing is still pretty hot."
5,Abstract Explorations Into New Worlds Of Sound!,"Pointless Orchestra is a group that created really interesting abstract music that challenged their listeners to hear music in new ways. Their music successfully combined free improvisation and sound collages to create something new out of familiar elements of sound. ""Approaching Totality"" includes a wide array of musical instruments from around the world but don't expect this to sound like folk music! It is more like a collection of strange collages that ebb and flow in constantly suprising directions. Even though this music is highly unusual, it is also very calming because there aren't any of the sudden blasts of noise or unsettling timbreal shifts that a lot of free improvisation and collage music contain. I read on their website that Pointless Orchestra disbanded a few years ago. Check out their work while it is still available!"
1,Bridges,"If you buy this product, I have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you.I gave it a star cause the program forced me to give it at least that."
3,Light reading,"This is light entertainment, reads fast, not deep. Read it for it's take me away calgon value, and that's all."
4,"Rare cuts, nice mix",I got a review copy for a newsletter I do. Wow. I usually don't go for compilations - but the mix here is really nice. (Beware the surprise track by Captain Beefheart at the end designed to wake you up.)Need a groovy dinner disc? This is it. And for a good cause it seems.Played this one for the girlfriend and she asked me to play it again. A rarity around my house.Pick it up.
1,Very Cheap Product,I regret purchasing this item. They are very cheap looking and definitely not how the picture portrays. they are skimpy and you need alot of them to make it look like a full display.
1,"Warning, these are NOTHING like the picture!","First of all, the flowers were badly squashed when we received them. They were in a flimsy plastic package, and the petals and leaves were bent and creased.The flowers are spaced much wider than they are in the picture. It looks cheap and sad. You'd definitely need to put two together to make it look decent.Finally, the lights on mine are red, not white as they are in the picture. This means the lights are barely visible even in the dark.The good points:* Battery operated, so there's no ugly cord hanging down.* Lights can blink or stay solid on.The bad points:* Flimsy and came crushed and creased.* Spaced poorly, making you need two strings for a lush appearance.* Red lights aren't attractive and aren't very visible.At a lower price, these might be acceptable. However, given the price I expected much better quality. I'm very disappointed. I would expect to find these at Big Lots or maybe a dollar store."
2,Poor product,"Purchased 4 of these to go up my stairs, was very disappointed in the product! Very cheaply made, not full at all and the lights are very dim! Definately NOT WORTH 19.00! I'm sending these back!"
2,Not at this price,"While this garland is a nice color, the quality of individual flowers are very very cheap. The wires came very twisted and intertwined it took some time to unfurl them. Also the flowers are not spaced as closely as pictured, nor can the flowers be reshaped. I have no problem with artificial flowers but usually they can be reshaped, not these whatever happens in packaging and shipping remains a permanent shaped into the flower. The lights do look nice and they all work. But the price should half of the current charge. Very dissatisfied. Wouldn't chance another purchase from seller as this item was so cheaply made."
4,they're cute,they were kinda smushed in the packaging and the lights are red not white like shown in the picture but they looked good hanging over my mirror
3,Love this garland,The poinsettias are great. Very easy to put the AA batteries in the case. I put them on the fireplace mantle and received many compliments.
4,needs more flowers,i know it did not have enough poinsettias on from reviews so my local phamacy hand white chip on ones so i bought 5 and put them in between now its great
1,This is Dangerous - don't buy,"I was excited when this garland arrived but when I opened the box the Poinsettias were all crunched and wrinkled. Much worse than that, when I put brand new batteries in it started SMOKING. This is a cheaply made product from China and a fire hazard. I couldn't return it quick enough. Amazon is great with returning defective items, thank goodness. Not even worthy of the 1 star I gave it."
3,"OK, but...","The garland strand itself is not anywhere near as ""full"" looking as shown in the product's Amazon photo. Still, it's a decent decoration which has now worked perfectly for two Holiday seasons. The flash/non-flash option is a nice feature."
2,The lights are RED!!!,I would love this if the lights were yellow or white as shown in the picture - but they are RED. I should have returned it but didn't take the trouble.
2,Don't get your hopes up,"The garland is flat and lifeless. There is too much space between poinsettias so it doesn't look as full as it appears in the picture. The plastic ""leaves"" are difficult to work with and the lights are not very bright. Not at all what I hoped for."
3,Not as pictured but still pretty,"My biggest disappointment with this product was that the lights were red not white like I expected from the picture. Also the pic gives the impression that it is very full and it's a lot more basic than that. I had to put on my staircase instead of on the mantle because of this. However, once I set it up it still fit in with my overall Christmas decor so I wasn't too upset. Just don't rely on the pic to give you an accurate representation of what you're getting."
1,"why did i remove this from my wish list, you ask....","Based on the reviews, I removed this from my wish list. Found no other way to successfully remove it from the list."
4,nice,not as long as i thought it would be or maybe my mantle is larger than the one in the pic that it is displayed on; anyhow still looked really nice on the mantel and the no cords is a bonus:)
3,Love the product,Did not come in the time frame that was noted came late and was not able to enter in the contest at work for best decorate door way. Love the item though
2,Poor Quality,"I ordered this item and was not happy with what I received. The playing surface is acceptable. However, the exterior vinyl is SO thin mine arrived with marks all over it. As well as unevenly melted together corners. The handle is very stiff and poorly made. Also note that I have tried to contact the seller NUMEROUS times in numerous ways to try to get another set. I am sorry to report that nobody will return any type of contact to me. I certainly cannot give this as a gift. Buyer beware."
4,"Need CPU power to record programs, but not so bad as a whole","I think you are a powerbook user, there's no other choice to watch tv on your computer than this one.I'm using Mac OS X 10.4.2, the latest so far, and there's no problem if it's only about watching tv program.But I found two problems so far:1. you need more CPU speed if you want to use this as a HDD recorder. My Powerbook got 1.5GHz G4, but it's apparently not fast enough.2. Only updating OS by 0.1 is sometimes enough to crash the software But wait, the guys always work really hard to fix problems.(...)"
1,Buy other guide book,"As a Cuban I must say that if anyone reads it before their first visit to the island they will be misimformed. But if it is read as a guide while in Cuba the visitor would be misguided, not knowing how much a meal costs or a hotel, etc. Totally useless. I recommend Lonely Planet's Travel Survival Kit - CUBA."
4,very condensed,"This book and the way it's advertised make it seem like an idiot's guide to Stats. However, it's not. It's actually pretty dense for that. It is a great supplement to a Stats class. It cuts through a lot of the nonsense and verbiage of many stats texts. I'd suggest using this to supplement the class (after lectures etc). It's also great to refresh yourself on basic stats and probability concepts once you've taken a course. I just wish it had more diagrams and pictures of the various distributions."
5,Learn the statistics by yourself,"It is very clear, neat book who wants to study statistics by him/herself. Book material is kinda easy to tear but, the coverage of book is very comprehensive. worth to buy for its price"
5,You're invited to a wedding...and a mystery!,"The sequel to ""The Mystery of the Missing Heiress""Jim's cousin is getting married and all of the Bob Whites are in the wedding! Cousin Hallie visits the Beldens. And in the middle of all the wedding preparation, Trixie and Honey - with the help of the Bob Whites - solve mysteries involving missing wheelchairs and an uninvited wedding guest."
3,Reasonably good,"I recieved this unit after Toshiba was unable to fix my xs-32.Unhappy my other unit broke but happy I was upgraded.Anyway, I was a little frustrated getting the xs34 going but after using it for a couple of months I am happy with it.Read the other reviews and haven't experienced many of the issues reported.My unit got the TV Guide info on the first night. Only issue with TV Guide is the unit displays info in some bizarre fashion. I thought displaying the channels chronogically would be appropriate. That took a couple of hours to edit. TV Guide not ready for primetime but adequate.Remote wasn't as friendly as the xs32.All in all - a resonable unit that I would not give a big recommendation to. If price were significatly less than competing brand then I would consider."
2,This is only for the USA,"I am one of the many growing numbers of Amazon.com devotees who live overseas but use Amazon to buy lots of products. I recently purchased this model only to find out that the TV Guide function means that it can only be used in the USA (by entering your zip code, etc.) I couldn't do it manually to suit my own local provider. Maybe I didn't read the instructions well enough but I'm returning this product to buy something else that will suit my needs. [...]"
2,Very nice machine- won't work without TV guide,Useless for recording from satellite receiver.Can't manually schedule recordings.Does not work with satellite TV.Only with TV Guide from cable.
2,"Bought it yesterday, returning it today","I purchased this item in lieue of the Panasonic HDD because my local electronics store was sold out of the former. Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews or check online pricing before I purchased, but I did confirm with the sales associate that I have 30 days to return this unit. The problems I have are simple... The TV Guide setup is not compatible with Directv (nor did they list the local cable provider for my zip code area) and that was annoying, but not a deal breaker. The dealbreaker is that, when you do record something off the TV there is NO WAY TO DELETE IT. The online instructions say to press the DELETE button on the remote, but the remote I have that comes with this unit doesn't have a DEL button, nor does it resemble the remote in the users manual.Tried every other button on the remote but couldn't delete the test recording. Hmmmmm."
3,Good idea but instructions written by someone on LSD,The product has a lot of nice features but getting them to work when you want them to can be difficult. The remote control is a mess. I hope you have a lot of free time to spend figuring it out.
4,Throw out the VCR,"I am groovin' with the Toshiba. In fact, I am now having trouble watching regular TV, because of all the comericals. So I am moving toward recording everything ahead of time so I can zip through the comericals. And I mean zip.The unit is not for those who won't read a manual. This is pretty sophisticated piece of equipment that can do many things, you have to be willing to sit down with the manual, and work through how to do editing and even the setup. I am using the TV Guide program to do recording, and it is working great. I have yet to burn a DVD, but am hoping that goes as well as everything else.The only 2 downsides. The machine is a bit noisy, even when turned off, and when you are recording a TV show, you can't watch another live broadcast. However, you can watch an already recorder show.At $400, this is a great deal."
2,"DVD recording fine at first, rapidly deteriorated...","As mentioned by some of the other reviewers, this unit has problems with transferring shows recorded on its hard drive to DVD. It worked fine at first, but within about 10-15 uses it started having problem: it would not recognize discs it had just made (error message of ""Check disc - it may be damaged), or it gave other error messages during the recording process. It seems to have an especially hard time with DVD-R discs, although it is stated to be compatible with them. After about a year of use the DVD recording function is essentially un-usable. The hard drive recording has worked well, though, and is somewhat user friendly after some practice."
2,Okay if you're a techno-wizard...,"I bought my Toshiba several years ago, avenging never to pay a subscription fee to the likes of DirecTV and Tivo. It was always a very difficult box to program, even with the TVGuide feature. When all broadcasters moved over from analog to digital, the signal stopped completely. Since then, I use an APP on my iPhone to find the time of shows I like, then manually program the information into the box. VERY convoluted, but it does work... unless (as is this time of year) broadcasters rearrange the lineup each week.Not overall pleased with the device; I am the only one in the household who can navigate all the screens to get things programmed, but it DOES save us subscription fees, I probably would never have bought this had I known how bad it was to program."
1,Do not buy this machine,I bought the RD-XS34 a little over two months ago. The Tivo functions work flawlessly. I immediately tested the DVD recorder functions and they worked flawlessly as well. For about 1 month. At this point the Dvd player neither records nor plays any DVD disk at all. Not commercial disks. Not DVDs it made. It is 100% nonfunctional. Less than 90 days after purchase. Don't buy it.
1,Big Problem with TV Guide Interface,"The TV Guide Interface is still not working after 4 weeks and Toshiba is very unhelpful in getting it resolved. Apparently, they are not willing to give out the TV Guide contact information and don't seem too interested in helping a new purchaser to get the problem resolved.I would strongly recommend that this product not be purchased because of the lack of customer support by either Toshiba or TV Guide"
2,The good is bad,"I bought the RD-XS35 Jan '07 and had no problems until last month when the TV Guide listing information stopped coming in altogether. The cable co. (Suddenlink) says it's not their problem and Toshiba says it's not theirs either. So, without TV Guide, this fabulous machine is now nothing more than an ordinary dvd player. I'm trying the manual recording instructions I read here from other reviewers. I agree that the instruction manual is poorly translated and difficult to understand. Also, the down button on the remote wore out about 6 mos. ago making it difficult to navigate the on-screen menu. A new one from Remotes.com is $57 plus $8 shipping.Before you buy: call your cable provider and make sure they support TVGuide online. Even if they do, know that it could change overnight like mine did. The cable co. has their own hdd's they rent and don't care if your third-party hdd doesn't work anymore."
2,Different From The Picture,"This pullover is disproportionate. The body is not as long as I would like, and the sleeves are super baggy. Also, the headspace is very tight. It's not as soft as I expected it to be.I would recommend going to a store and trying on sweatshirts instead of just buying them online. You just don't know how it's going to fit your body."
1,fleece pullover,well i really can't write a review cause the seller had to give me my money back due to lack of product available. this product was unavailable after i purchase it
5,Great Hoodie,Seller sent on time and the hoodie is one of the BEST....my son loves it and I love the brown....great gift. Thanks.
4,nice fit,Perfect size and very durable and the price was perfect. I am a little rough on clothes and these hold well. A quailty item for a good price
2,"80% cotton is not ""fleece"".",Fleece is polyester. A wool substitute that can stand up to a little drizzle and moisture and stay warm. Cotton is a different story altogether.
2,Poor quality - very disappointed in Champion,"I bought this sweatshirt six months ago in dark gray for my husband as a gift. He loved it at first. However, after only a few washings, it's pilling horribly!! It looks just awful, like it's covered in small, white ""hair balls."" We've washed it inside-out, in cold water, and dried it on low each time, yet it already looks years old. Inexcusable, in my book."
4,Very comfortable!,It is very comfortable and warm but it has some trouble when theres a bit of wind. It seems to work great when its about 40 degrees out which here is cold since were used to 110 degree summers (Las Vegas).
3,Rather better than average,"Comfortable, well made, reasonable care instructions. Good as a bottom layer or near bottom layer in cool to warm situations. Does a good job wicking and is OK in damp conditions although soaks up rain quickly. Not really warm designed for moderate conditions. But nice and comfortable where it is suitable. Really for strenuous activity in 40 to 60F damp/humid conditions (fine for dry too). Has problems in windy conditions so needs a wind proof over layer there."
1,Sssuuuccckkksss!!!!1,"What is this? Some tracks taken from old records! They should put here some exclusives, all this tracks are available on records of those artist."
5,The Title Says It All,"""Music Inspired by Scarface"" is a mix of classical joints from the hood. Alot of songs talking about mostly the same thing as the theme of the Movie Scarface. Songs about drugs, hustling, and all that stuff. This is a definitely good mix, with a lot of famous artists like Cam'ron, Jewelz Santana, Mobb Deep, Ice Cube, DMX, NWA, Jay-z, and of course the C.E.O of Def Jam, Scarface himself. This album also has interludes from the movie. Don't get me wrong, I bought this album already and it is good, take my word. If you are a Scarface collector or Scarface lover then this is a definite album to buy."
1,Giv dis one a miss,"AN ALBUM OF SCARFACE INSPIRED CUTZ...AND NOT ONE THREE-6-MAFIA OR SKIINY PIMP SONG IN SIGHT. FOLLOW MC RENS ADVICE, AND DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS DEF~JAM FLOP"
2,THE CATCH,"The cover looks ""Wow! This guide must be really good!"" but the game is already simple enough. This guide is like a blank peice of paper. But the game getsLevels: B-Graphics: ASound: A-Fun Factor: F- and beyond"
5,One of the best trance albums I own,"From beginning to end, this album just gets better and better. I really enjoy tracks 8-12 the most. That is when the CD really picks up, although the first 7 are solid songs too. A couple tracks can be found on Paul Oakenfold albums, such as El Nino (#2). Kimball does a great job mixing it up on this CD, and the flow changesa few times. This was my first trance album, and soon after I bought the equally impressive Tranceport by Oakenfold. I would rate both of these equally, but this album would be reccomended to just about anyone. Believe me, you won't be sorry!"
2,"Not terrible, but not really good, either...","I was looking forward to this cd based on all the good reviews I've read of it, but it's really disappointing. It starts off on a perplexing note, as well - Water, one of my favorite songs, is cut down to a mere 42 seconds.Anyway, the rest is pretty disappointing as well. I've never really liked El Nino, or the 3n1 mix of Cafe Del Mar. With the exception of Obelix, which I really like, the other songs are mediocre at best.There are dozens of better mix cds out there. Spend your money on them..."
2,"trance for the club not the home, with hits you already have","2 stars may sound negative, but as purely a listening experience, I deem it appropriate. This is club trance that is really suited for a club, and not home use.It starts off with a pointless 30 seconds of ""Water"", then goes into ""El Nino"" by Agnelli & Nelson. Now this track is a true classic, but putting it as the first track, with it's looong breakdown just doesn't work. It does transition nicely into ""Obelix"" which is a rocking groove that works in India vocals- which the listener may or may not care for. Following are a couple of acceptable if not that special trancey numbers, followed by the good old ""Cafe Del Mar"" which litters dozens of compilations. Then some questionably cheesy tracks kick in, with some definately dodgy vocals (""Body Shine"") comes to mind.Is this a bad disc? Not really, but with so many trance compilations out there, why settle for this when dozens more are better?"
4,Trance 2000 is better,"O.K.Maybe I'm being a bit harsh with 4 stars. Compared to most albums, I would give it 5 stars, but I bought Generation Trance 2000 before this one. 2000 blew me away and I was up and dancing by myself in no time, entertaining people walking by my house.This album is mixed smoothly, I didn't notice much flaws at all. The music is soothing and pumping all at once, but the track selection is better on his other album.Buy this album if you can afford both. It is amazing. If you can afford 1, then buy 2000--that is mind-blowing. (note: haven't heard the new album yet)"
1,dino floor puzzle,the puzzle looks interesting. When we recieved it almost all the pieces were slightly bent. it hardly stays together and the peices are very thin. not recommended for young children.
4,"Audio quality bad, but performances fascinating","First off, it needs to be said that these recordings are from Edison's original phonograph design. The audio quality leaves a lot to be desired, and there is a lot of surface noise.But, having said that, it is fascinating to hear many G&S; standards performed by people who were actually directed by W.S. Gilbert. Even more fascinating is hearing Richard Temple sing the parts he originated (""Pirate King"" from Pirates of Penzance, and ""A More Humane Mikado"" from Mikado). And it's too bad that Rutland Barrington never recorded anything by Gilbert and Sullivan, but one can hear from the piece that he did record how good he must have been as Pooh-Bah or Captain Corcoran. Other famous artists are represented also.If you are a fan of G&S;, and want to hear how it was originally performed, this is just about the only chance you'll get."
1,"This book should be re-titled ""Dour Sayings for Marriage""","First off, the title of this little 95 page book was a very poor choice. This book should be re-titled ""Dour Sayings for Marriage and Divorce."" When I passed the book to my girlfriend she would not even look through it. Her terse comment, ""There is no JOY! in divorce"" probably sums up how most who see the book's title react. This is a book of somber and dreary proverbs that commiserate the dark side of marriage. Adages, such as Leonardo DaVinci quote, ""Marriage is like putting one's hand into a bag of snakes on the chance of drawing out an eel"" typify the selection of quotes. I cannot see the beneficial aspect of giving this book to a friend who has just divorced. Not Recommended."
4,John McCormack in English Song,"Many of the songs are great. It sounds like you are listening to them on an old Victrola, which is fine because that's how I remember them when my dad played the old 78's. However, tracks 24 (The Blind Ploughman) & 25 (I Hear You Calling Me) do not play - it sounds like the volume is being turned on, off, on, off, etc. - more off than on - completely worthless. Whatever happened to quality control?"
1,Stumbling on prophecies,"How about that! I spent money in the amount of two scholarships to buy this book and all i got is a tutorial on how to please your boss and the customers! As i am still a student looking for enlightment on this subject i thought Jack Ganssle's book could take me there. No doubt it has valuable information, but that is spreaded across almost 250 pages like marbles on ice(could be resumed in a few pages of tips and tricks). If i wanted ""filosofia"" i would have read Nietzsche, if i wanted literature i would have read Miller. But i was looking for embedded systems design and i got almost nothing! Obsessing about the fact that ""every idiot can write code"" is not much of an ""art"". Very poor on examples, too much of ""this thing should be done this way or else ..."", lots of statistics and no fun!He might be a good engineer but he is a poor teacher!Don't buy this book unless you have Liberia's defficit in your account!"
2,Some good playing BADLY let down,"All you really need to do is listen to the first 29 seconds of the last movement of the Vaughan Williams with the score, and that should be enough to persuade you not to buy this recording.Mr Lucarelli is a fine and beautiful player, but lack of attention to detail of the Lehigh Valley Chamber Orchestra, and more importantly the engineers/producers is execrable.The orchestra is frequently out of tune, in completely in the wrong place, or just generally come unstuck with the soloist completely. The real crime is that the producers allowed it to happen, and allowed it to be released!If this had been a live recording, some of this may have been acceptable; it wasn't, so it isn't.An amateurish attempt, marring some excellent playing from the soloist (this fine playing being the only reason I rated it with 'two' stars rather than a pitiful 'one'). Don't waste your money."
3,Will knob break off?,"I ordered one of these in Kiwi over a year ago from Amazon. It's a beautiful baker; and the stoneware is wonderful to bake in--plus it cleans up easily, although a little scrubbing with nylon is sometimes needed or soaking overnight in sudsy water. I love Le Creuset's stoneware products and continue to collect them! The knob on the baker I ordered arrived with a hole bored through it which seemed to serve no purpose. It was livable withable and didn't affect appearance, so I kept the baker. However, the lid was evidentially hit a bit while in storage at home; and the knob cracked at the base and became loose. So this is a warning to store stoneware carefully and be advised that knobs are easily broken. It seems some of the newer Le Creuset bakers avoid this problem by getting rid of knobs!"
3,The knob breaks off easily,"I really like this pan but like another reviewer said, the knob is fragile. It makes storing the lid unwieldy because it is too high to have the lid sit flat while upside down in the pan. I pulled the lid out of the cupboard first and hit the knob on the edge of the pan and the knob cracked clean off."
3,Comprehensive but Dated,"This is a reprint of a book that's been around since the sixties. It needs an update, especially the exercises, which are somewhat disorganized. The authors, like many mathematicians, have difficulty with the spoken language and do not adequately motivate the material, on an historical or intellectual basis. That said, this is still one of the best introductions to the subject available, at less than 20% the going cost of a textbook."
3,Outdated notation and very dull,"I know maths books aren't meant to be fun to read, but this book is *extremely* boring. It's got, in my opinion, too much content, and its content could've been explained more efficiently.Most of the notation used in this book (it was published 36 years ago) is out of date, which can be annoying as it makes the confusion subject of group theory even more confusing.The good thing about this book is that it's great value for money. However, as said above, it might contain too much if you're an undergraduate student like myself who just wants to understand the basic stuff."
5,Better than perfect!!,"Perfect addition to our country kitchen!! And much cheaper than anywhere else!! I am beyond happy with this purchase. Would recommend to anyone! Strong, durable and perfect look!"
5,Major upgrade for my dash speakers in my 01' GMC Jimmy.,"Im replacing every speaker with Polk audio DB series speakers.the stock dash speaker was a small (1 - inch) tweeter on a 4x6 plate. I found once i removed the stock 4x6, there was plenty of room to drop these Polk BD 4x6's in.The sound difference was incredible. they are very loud. the sound quality is grreat!! im getting alot more depth in sound in the front.now all i need is some polk DB 5.25in speakers for my back doors and i'd have them all replaced!!!"
5,Satisfied!,Speaker were shipped fast and arrived on time. Everything was as described brand new and worked wonderfully! I will be buying from them again and will recommend to friends!
4,great highs and clean mids,"I haven't installed these speakers in my Blazer yet, but I did hook them up to see how they sound and the highs are crisp and the mids are clean. I am pleasently supprised since they are a cheaper line of Polk and are now made in China, used to be made in Europe. Overall good sound from these. I'm going with the same series for the rest of the speakers in my truck."
3,pretty good,"to me most car speakers sound the same once you're on the road , especially in an older car that's noisier than most , they sound great when standing still . lol . overall satisfied with them , not too expensive so how can i complain , just didn't knock my socks off ."
4,speakers,not much to say.they work and sound really well on my average truck stereo.I have nothing bad to say about them.
1,Too shiny,"This does not have a patent leather appearance, however it is much too high gloss for general wear.Additionally the shoes mark flooring excessively"
2,ok but with little understanding,"Garah Landes may eventually gain the experience and touch to create beautiful performances, but this recording seems labored and square. He plays accurately enough, but seems to lack a sense of direction in his phrasing, missing the overall musical picture. These are some of the finest American composers, and they deserve better treatment. I have used this recording to hear what I DON'T want to do in my own playing."
5,"Insightful, practical, simple, and priceless!","This is definitely the kind of book that can change a life. The ideas, stories and analogies shared repeatedly strike that ""ah-ha"" cord within. Amezquita is a ""master"" who's reached his conclusions EXPERIENTIALLY - not theoretically. His wisdom makes the complex, simple, and the esoteric, practical. A truly wonderful book!"
5,Great Fun,"This book is very well designed. Inside there is a sticker book, and a booklet that has spaces for stickers. You put the correct stickers next to the captions and sort of build the story with the stickers. However, the stickers can last more than once. You can peel them off their spots and put them anywhere you like. It includes over 60 colorful stickers. A good buy."
3,Too much money,"I've been having a hard time finding anything ""Monsters Inc"" so when I saw this I thought I'd give it a try. My son loves Monsters Inc. the movie. The reason I gave it three stars was because I think it's priced too high. The book is pretty flimsy and it's really more for an older kid probably because yeah, there are captions and places to put the stickers...but for the young kids that really are watching the movie I'd say that age range is from 2 years to maybe 5 or 6. I think they missed the mark with the way the book is laid out because you have to be a little older than 5 or 6 to be able to read the captions like the way they have it laid out in this sticker book. I guess I was hoping for something a little young kid friendly. Ten bucks is definitely too much for this. I wouldn't have bought this if I were in a store shopping. Not for ten bucks. I'm not going to send it back either...too much hassle. Delivery was fast though...thanks to Amazon prime."
1,does not fit tub spout,This product does not fit the spout of a tub and so is useless. I cannot recommend it for that purpose.
2,Disappointing,"If you are looking for a good PVD CD buy Global or Politics of Dancing, don't waste your money on this one. A few songs are OK but this album sound more like a soundtrack to a movie w/all the vocals. The songs are not mixed, there is no space between the songs but they were not mixed together. If you like slow vocal songs then this might be OK, but if you are used to PVD great driving beats from previous albums then pass. As one who has seen him live this does not live up to his DJing talents."
1,moving away form origins more like ATB,"This album is the first in a new progression for DJ/producers of the trance genre. This album is much like ATBs albums and now the newly released Armin Van Buuren album. Vocally, poppy and radio ready. A disappointment from Paul Van Dyke's origins as a trance dance DJ."
3,PVD : TMV,"PVD:TMV. ""TMV"" means TOO MANY VOCALS.However, I believe I have a solution for those whoare irritated by vocals in trance music.First, let's recognize (because of his past work) thesheer GENIUS of Paul Van Dyk. Nobody is better forreally injecting true surges of ecstasy in hismusic...immortal tracks like Words, Forbidden Fruit,For An Angel, Face to Face (MANY other singles)plus entire CDs like Politics of Dancing...sheer GENIUS.Reflections, unfortunately, is a waste of time & money;however, I believe I have a solution to this problem.Since ""Connected"" is the only very-good song on the CD,don't buy Reflections, but buy the CD single that hasTWO versions of Connected on it...then you're fine."
3,Not all that,"I like tracks 1 and 5. It's a CD you'll listen maybe once a month. Not a Good CD for a House party. Try Tiesto, sander, Armin or christopher lawrence"
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"I'm sure the diehards of this genre will think this is the greatest album ever, but I don't find it to be anything special. The vocals are lame and the electronica is just as lame. I do grant the fact that is truely an ""album"" in the sense that one song leads into the next and there is a general theme and character across all the songs. Unfortunately, it's just not a very good one."
1,Probably worth less than one star,"Oh the joy, the euphoria when I first heard Nothing But You and it can still bring a tear to my eye and remind me of oh so many brilliant ecstatic nights. However is this CD worth the price for that track because its the only thing of any value on this? the simple answer is no. There are very few CDs I have bought and felt ripped off and unfortunately this falls into that category."
1,This is crap!!!!,"Of all his bad cd's this is definitely his worst. This is not trance this is crap. I don't understand why all his cd's suck when he has some good live sets. If you want a good trance cd get a George Acosta cd, the best trance dj period."
3,"PvD could've done better, but an A for effort anyway.","I just bought this CD, and I can tell you that I've heard better stuff from him than this. It's certainly not the best from PvD, but at least he's trying to experiment with other stuff without going all out like Oakenfold (what happened to him?).The Good:-Crush, Reflections, Nothing but You, and Connected.-It's sure better than what ATB and/or Oakenfold are cranking out right now.The Bad:-The bass on ""Time of Our Lives"" is not that great. The club mix is way better.-Paul's vocals (""That's Life"")-Too many vocals.The Ugly:-""Like a friend."" I understand his purpose in making this one, but find another vocalist, please.Conclusion:-If you want to buy it, you won't be completely disappointed. But I'd recommend ""Global,"" ""Politics of Dancing,"" or ""Out There and Back"" instead."
2,he's lost his way,"Ok i'll cut to the case,speaking as a true PvD fan i am devasted i have been jilted by a man who i felt would never let all us fans downhalf this CD is classic euphoric PvD while the other half is in all honesty a disaster in experimintation with such horrors as 'Knowledge' showing why PvD should stick to what he is good at. As well as this the album is full of short radio length tracks like 'Time of our lives'and 'Homage' which scream out CHEESEY!. My recomendation is that if u buy this CD burn the tracks you like to MP3 and use an MP3 mixer like Traktor or PCDJ and make ur own mix of the album while adding in a couple of other PvD songs from his B sides then use the original copy of Refelctions as a frisbee or a coffee coaster which is all the album as whole is good for"
3,it's okay,i give this album a 3.5 out of 5. the 1st track starts off with the typical pvd sound with thumping bass. the cd slows down in the middle and some of the vocals sound really cheezy. overall it's definately an experimental album for pvd but like any great musician even when they experiment it sounds half decent... if pvd had started his career with this cd he wouldn't be famous.. but i guess since i've heard so much of his stuff i give him some benefit of the doubt and can hear some synths within the music that are his trademark..
2,"Repetitive and boring, don't buy it","I'm a big fan of Van Dyk's stuff, and I'm hugely disappointed in this album. Sure, techno/trance has been accused of being repetitive, but this even makes me wonder why anyone would want to listen to this boring, repetitive stuff. I thought there was something wrong with my CD player at first. It almost sounds like he started recording the first minute and then walked away, letting the 1st minute repeat over and over again 5 times for each song."
2,music to sell out to,"listening to this cd, you will hear such profunditities as, ""In the kaleidescope of chaos; we're going to extremes; and people have lost their dreams (no dreams)"" You will also, after a lengthy intro, hear a generic house soul sister petulantly intone, ""I know you want meeee"" just before the groove starts ramping. You will also hear various well-trammelled hip-hopisms like a black man saying ""yeeeah... right about now..."" and various other penetrating observations. If this sounds like a must hear, go nuts."
3,Bland Album,"This album was not what I was expecting. There are a couple tracks worth while listening to, but overall I should have bought something else."
2,When trance goes mainstream...,"Hopefully Reflections will get this pop/trance/hip hop feeling out of his system so that he can get back to doing what made him famous- trance.I've been listening to trance for a very long time now. I also spin it too... and when I heard this I realized that it was meant to be played on the radio and in cheap Trance Anthem compilations. Jan Johnston has a beautiful voice but vocal trance is something to be used sparingly. The album gets old fast with vocal after vocal and to top it off the album isnt even mixed.If you're into Pop/ Vocal Trance then you'll like this (there's a 12 step program somewhere...). But if you're the type of person who buys records, listen to music other than trance (progressive, minimal, house, etc...) and really knows the genre of electronic then avoid the album. Its too mainstream and poppy to be considered trance. But find a single of Connected... its very mixable and will probably find its way into many sets and playlists."
3,Disappointing,"After living through album after album of blissful PVD trips, Reflections comes across to me as a great disappointment. Even if you set the sappy vocal (as in lyircal) tracks aside, this is an album without a common feeling, sense of purpose or real flow. Unlike OT&B or 7ways, there isn't an overall feel to the album; nothing grabs you, takes you for the ride to the heights of melody. To top it off, I love PVD albums -- including his DJ mixes -- because of the highs and lows, the crescendo at the finish, a definite setting of pace and feeling. Reflections doesn't seem to want to take the listener in any particular direction, and the mix from one track to the next seems little more than a crossfade rather than a cleverly designed coda. ALL THAT SAID... a disappointing PVD is still better than the majority of trance/DJ compositions or mixes being released."
1,So far the poorest work of Mr. Van Dyk,"This was the most anticipated album this year on my side and yet the biggest disappointment, after being somewhere in the middle I wanted to throw it out the window...I expected van Dyk to show a new direction or at least some progression of his (brilliant so far) work, but this is clearly a step back."
4,"PVD, true maestro in the DJ world!","This was my first serious listen to PVD's work, and I gotta' say, I love it. In general, I'm a big fan of DJ-styled electronica (Tiesto, BT, Sasha, etc.) and this album ranks up there with the best. Love the vocals by Jan Johnston. My favorite track of the album is opening one, ""Crush"", although I also love ""Reflections"" and ""Buenaventura""."
4,Changing directions,"When PVD decided to make a different kinda album,I was very skeptical because I thought it might end up being something like BT's ""Emotional Technology""which didnt quite cut it for me.This album is very upbeat,however there are several tracks I dont care for thats why I was forced to give it a 4 star rating.Any dance lover should pick up a copy of this."
4,EHHHH!,"If you are used to the previous albums that get you in a mood to chill, don't buy this one, just download the few tracks with no vocals on them, except the last 4, cuz they are definitely worth the money. In tracks like That's Life, you get dissappointed because behind all the vocals, which i'm not fond of, lies a great trance track that you hardly can hear because of the vocals. Not the greatest album, but everyone has to experiment once in a while, and that's what this is....failed."
1,Terrible,"I loved ""Seven Ways."" Loved ""Out There and Back."" Loved the second CD of ""Politics of Dancing."" But this is incredibly weak. It sounds like the sort of music an advertising agency would use to sell an Oldsmobile. It's the sort of music you might hear on the sound system at Barnes & Noble. Horrible, emasculated, worthless for clubbing, too boring to even chill-out to. Where have you gone, Paul Van Dyk? A lonely club scene turns its ears from you..."
5,"Great for a natural, healthy glow!","I LOVE this stuff. I bought the lighter shade (natural blush) and it's fantastic. Sweep a big soft brush through all of the colors to add a perfect glow look to your cheeks, or you can use the colors separately to create a more contoured cheekbone. It's cheap (about $4 at Walmart) and it works very well. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it doesn't look too glittery, either. It should last a while as well."
5,Must read,"Great book. It taught me a lot and gave me some useful tips for child raising. It's a ""must read"" for any caring adult. It gave me a new look at the learning process and helps explain where and how the school system and ""us"" as parents both fail in proper education for our youth."
5,Developing Positive Self-Images & Discipline in Black Children,This is a very informative and helpful book. I have learned a lot and seriously recommend that everyone read it!
2,Ummm.. No.,"A book that has its moments, but everything seemed to perfect. Dragons, dracolichs, baatezu and other powerful creatures were being destroyed, killed, mutilated etc. and that somehow ruined the book. The main characters (the Knights, Elminster) do not face an actual challenge other than different monsters and characters. Shandril did face a certain problem about controlling her powers, but with companions like the Knights of Myth Drannor and Elminster, it always seemed as if there was nothing that could go wrong, even if she blundered big time. An average novel, novels that practically anyone can write, not only Ed Greenwood. Can't really blame him, for he receives an outline of the story TSR wants, and then he creates a more detailed plot along that line"
5,A must read for any fantasy fans out there,"An absolutely fabulous tale filled with adventure, suspense, humor, action, and even a little romnace. Ed Greenwood does an excellent job in capturing the colorful characters of the Forgotten Realms, and delivers them in a book that you will read over and over again."
1,ZERO STARS,"Great cover, worst book I ever read. Comical is the word for its juvenile writings. I've read many Forgotten Realms novels (I'm a glutton for punishment) and I had always thought that Douglas Niles' Crystal Shard Series were the worst I've read, but this takes the cake. But the cover of the book is almost worth the money. Clyde rules."
1,"I'm speechless, but in a bad way.","The book starts with potential, but drops off somewhere when you realize that the author has no concept of story structure. I must admit, he gets better with his next books, but this one really needs to be rewritten. I have to be honest and admit that the cool cover made me buy it. Shame on me, but good marketing from TSR."
1,A bad role-playing session is better than this atrocity.,"Oh, the irony of life...Ed Greenwood, like so many creators of vast literary universes, makes marvelous worlds, but when it comes down to breathing life into his creations, he fails to capture the essence that belongs to the inhabitants of this world. This book stinks so badly because it has no sense of characterization. The action in the book reminded me of a novice dungeon master setting up his first campaign to a group of first time players who don't want a good storyline, just a simple hack-and-slash scenario. If you want a good read, try R. A. Salvatore's Dark Elf Series. If you want to lower your mental capacity, read Spellfire...the garanteed lobotomy for fantasy lovers everywhere."
3,A Good Read if you are a Forgotten Realms Fan!!,"Well I believe that some of these people who gave these scathing remarks about this book are truely on something...Well not in the ballpark of one of Greenwood's best books it is an enjoyable experience of an unassuming girl suddenly thrusted into happenstance by an urge of wanderlust and her adventure on the way, And yes Ed Greenwood makes ""Invincible"" characters but I do not look at how the characters are ""Strength-wise"" I look at how the book was done and how they are portrayed...My review: A great read for someone new to the DnD Genre of books, and a good read for some of us oldsters who have read out fair share, if only to tide us over until the next trilogy or Big Novel....3 Happy stars"
4,Creative and Amazingly Actioned-packed,"When I first heard of this book from a friend of mine, I thought that it was just another weird D&D novel without the usual good stuff of great fantasy novels, but as I was a new member of the D&D world, I decided to try this one out. After reading this book, I was amazed at the wonderful depictions of a young girl's innocence and need for adventure. In this book, Ed Greenwood has brought to life in me a love for the Forgotten Realms and books about them. After reading this book, I read approximately 30 - 40 other Forgotten Realms books, but I would like to attribute my sparked interest to the action-packed ""Spellfire."" Also, the ""Crown of Fire"" book of the Hapers series is a great sequel."
1,Disgusting! How can anyone publish this?,"This book was so awful, I wouldn't know where to start. Let me just say this: I liked absolutley nothing about this novel. Writing it was a vile thing to do, publishing it and letting it out on an unsuspecting public is attempted genocide."
1,Should be called an adventure accessory instead of a novel,"This ""novel"" lacks the depth of other TSR books. It seems to be taken directly from a AD&D adventure: I don't like to read details about spells like a quote from the Dungeon Masters Guide. It is ok on a game but not on a novel. On a novel you describe the effects of a spell, not its name. The rest of the book follows the same style. Use it as a draft for a role play adventure. If you want a real good novel, apart from the classics, try Nightwatch, also from TSR."
1,REALLY BAD,"This book was really bad. It has no plot whatsoever and poorly developed characters. shandril an orphan girl becone friend with the company of the bright spear, by stealing all thier stuff. Ed Greenwood kills them all in the third chaper. she falls in love with the aprentice mage Narm, who a complete whimp, just by looking at him and he dose to. People attack them for no good reason at all. There is also a lot of love making between Narm and Shandril. It even happens five minuets after they meet, and they do it on a pile of gold! Ed, you might fantisize doing it on a pile of gold but I dont. The only reason I bought this book was for the really cool cover. Like they say you cant judge a book by its cover, and this is deffentetly true for this one. I dont know why wizards of the cost decided to remake this horrible book, and why Ed kept on going wit the series."
3,"Confusing plot to a nonexpert, but a must Realms fans","What is Banedeath? Who leads the Zhentarim? What is the Cult of the Dragon? Who is the Brotherhood compared to the True Followers of Bane? You must know your realms power groups or the story is just like a Russian Novel with a million characters competing against each other. The story is great, but Mr. Greenwood does not bother to tell you much about the competing groups or characters. Nonrealms people will be confused and hate this utterly complex story. Semmonon, Manshoon, and Fzoul make the good bad guys. But forget the Cult of the Dragon is confusing and clutter. Botton line you must know the Split of the Church of Bane, Zhentarim power structure, and the basics of the Cult of the Dragon to make any sense of book. A must read for Realms lovers. Enjoy"
1,This book doesnt really deserve 1 star...,"but thats the worst I can give it. This book is incredibly awful. Reading is the wrong word, suffering through it is more appropriate. It is the typical Ed Greenwood novel of a big, bad, evil, and largely unknown force chasing down a person who is largely helpless except for one special power. Anyway, trust me, if this had been the first FR novel I read, I would never have read another.IT IS AWFUL!"
1,I've read this before...with a plot,"Ok I've read about a person not aware of raw magical energy stored inside themselves, except the character was well developed, he had companions that were well developed, but his powers had discriptions and lively detail of how the magic acted, crackled, etc. The book was by Terry Brooks, not Ed Greenwood"
3,Spellfire? Maybe.,"I thought Spellfire was an OK book, but not one of those ""You must read this book."" things.At times it was to Lovey! The only thing I kept reading this book for, was because of Torm. He was just, plain FUNNY!!Narm and Shandril were to Kissy, Kissy, if you know what I mean.I think I might read Crown of Fire, but it might be the same thing."
1,Very VERY disspapointing,"I don't have the words to say much, only that I was surprised that Ed Greenwood can write a book THIS bad."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"Where do I begin? The book was just absolutely horrible. It starts our great with a small group of adventures that you kind of come to like. But another chapter later, they are all dead. It just seems that there is a bunch of fighting and no plot. And the characters that do survive are the ones you could care less about. Save your time. DONT READ THIS BOOK!"
1,Ed Greedwood is a poor writer.,Ed Greenwook uses to many super powerful hero's villians to make his books even remotly interesting. You don't care about the characters and its a slow read. I suggest somthing from R.A. Salvitore instead.
4,Great books about the American Civil War,These books are an excellent subject of reading if you are very interested in the American Civil War. Shelby Foote write these three volumes in a fascinating way. It almost gives you a feeling that he has experienced the civil war himself. Very lively written. Once you start reading you can't stop.
4,Pure but excellent narrative,"I wouldn't argue with 5 stars for this. It is a purely narrative account, detailed, well-written, never dull. Who did what when, and some insight into character too. I preferred MacPherson's more analytical account, and some of the more specialized books, but this is the longest book I have ever read, and I enjoyed it all. That says something good about it! If you are only going to read one 3500 page book on the civil war ..."
3,Where are the African Americans?,"Having ploughed to the end of volume 2 at more than 1,000 pages, I asked myself this question: where are the blacks in this narrative? If you like a book about the Civil War without even a glance at slavery, then these volumes are for you."
2,Print was too small for my visually impaired son,"Ordered this set for my son, who is visually impaired (not blind). Print was too small so it was returned. I was NOT with the amount of the refund."
1,History my eye!,Anybody who thinks that Shelby Footes long winded plonk is accurate Civil War history had better really READ IT !He thinks that any atrocity committed by the Confederates was ok (even the cowardly murders of unarmed soldiers and men and boys ect by Quantrill and his gutless crowd of psychopaths) but let the Union forces of Freedom fight back and he bleats that it was an outrage ect ect.He must have got his research from GONE WITH THE WIND and Klu Klux Klan meetings.Sorry but that's the facts. But then he IS a good old boy so I guess they are still whining.
5,The Best and most Comprehensive Civil War Books Ever!!!!,"I have to say that personally what Shelby Foote has done in these magnificent books, could never be duplicated. You could not claim to be an expert, a buff, or a reenactor before reading these books. It took the Union and Confedrates 4 long years to fight the civil war, it took shelby 20 to write, not passing up the slightest detail.The way he pays attention to the western theater of war rather than getting a case of virginiatis is incredible. Sure the Southern Generals are shown in a more sympathetic light but he grew up in the yazoo mississippi delta, what do you expect.As for his lack of portraing slavery I think on the cover of the book the title is The Civil WAR a Narrative, not the story of slavery"
5,A good buy,"The classic Civil War narrative. Shelby Foote manages to maintain a degree of impartiality although his sympathies obviously lie with the Confederate States whose commanders are painted as heroic even in defeat. I first read these books as a child and they have lost none of their ability to enthrall and captivate a reader and to drag them headlong into understanding the conflict that shaped modern America. Reading Footes' superb narrative you can smell the cordite; hear the cannon fire; hear the Rebel yell; feel the musket balls plucking at your uniform, and zinging around you as you walk toward the enemy. The gut wrenching feeling of futility, men lost in a noble cause fighting an enemy that fought with virtually one hand (and both legs) tied behind their backs. This was a war that the North could only lose and the South could never win. The genius of Foote is that he blends all these strands together into a readable historical narrative and maintains objectivity."
5,Both sides of the Civil War,"This is a 3 volume work. it describes in detail the entire war, from before the start to after Jeff Davis finished writing his book about the war in the late 1870's.It goes into detail describing what each side was doing at each of the battles, as well as what was going on in Lincoln's head, and Jeff Davis.You are dealing with about 3,000 pages, so it takes awhile.The writing is excellent."
5,Shelby Foote One of best Civil War authors,"Shelby calls this a ""narrative"" and it truly is very readable and presented in a ""conversationable"" mode. There are three volumes dealing with all aspects of the Civil War from beginning to end. I may read 20 to 30 books per year, and I simply have to rate these three volumes as belonging ""on top of the heap."""
5,The most complete work ever on the War,"Shelby Foote's classic multi-volume history of the War Between the States will always stand as THE must-read. Foote gives a balanced and fair account of the heroics and failings of both sides and a vivid account of each battle that makes the reader feel part of the action. Sure to stand the test of time, Foote's works are as invaluable to history and students of the war as the Official Records and the many officer's memoirs."
5,A classic.,"I have more of a general reader's perspective on this set, as I am not a historian, nor an academic. However, I realize this is a classic; from I've gotten through so far, rightfully so.First, this set is huge. It's taken me about two years just to get up the courage to start reading it. It's slow going, but that's because you are so enthralled in it. It is a truly great read, and I can't imagine a better narrative, nor a more descriptive one.The only problem I have is that I wish there were more of the little graphics that show troop movements throughout the books. These really help you visualize the action more. Actually, there could probably be a whole companion book with these troop movements laid out to correspond with the chapters.Overall though, you can't go wrong with this classic."
4,Great history that reads like a novel,"Everyone has seen Shelby Foote on TV by now, either in the PBS ""Civil War"" series or on one of A&E's programs. He's usually described as a ""writer"" rather than historian, but believe me--he's both. Par excellence. The only drawback about this mammoth 3-volume, 2500 page work is that it's a narrative, rather than a history book with footnotes. Although there is little to worry about in regards to Shelby Foote having his facts mixed up, it would have been nice if the reader could go to the source of the anecdote for further reading. Hence, the 4 stars vice 5. No matter. Just find an easy chair and relax. Enjoy history that reads like an excellent novel."
5,The Civil War told masterfully by a great story teller,"The Civil War: A Narrative - by Shelby Foote is a fantastic deal, both savings wise and story wise. Foote, although not a historian, can weave a tale of non-fiction that makes the reader feel as if they are listening to a CW veteran who saw and experienced all the tragedy of Americas great tradegy. Amazon made this possible for me at a considerable savings and that just made the whole experience with Foote so much sweeter.I will enjoy refering to how Foote related the period and use some of his unique explanations in my lectures and presentations."
3,Far too exhaustive an account of the Civil War,I found segments of the book absorbing but found the minute details of the book far more than this reader needed to understand to enjoy reading about the war. Had the three volume set been edited to 1000 pages total rather than 3000 it would have been more to my liking. I can find little fault in the way Foote presented the history but his likeable personality that came through in the Ken Burn's series unfortunately hides in the background in this monumental accomplishment.
5,BEST EDITION OF THIS CLASSIC!,"Shelby Foote's monumental narrative gets the ultimate treatment here, paired with TIME-LIFE's vast treasure of photographs and smartly divided into 14 volumes. The knock on the more common 3 volume set is that each doesn't sit on your lap without numbing it in no time - they're heavy and indigestible. This is a very smartly produced set that will be a treasure on any bookcase; well-bound, expensive paper and nice bookcovers (when placed in order they produce a photograph of a Union encampment). I can't think of a better way to read or show this classic. I am surprised that it's out-of-print and that nothing was done for it's 50th anniversary publication (this is the 40th anniversary edition) but if you look hard or are lucky (just recently got my edition) to see this anywhere, get it. I don't hold out much hope for a better-produced set of Civil War history than this."
5,Extremely informative and interesting.,"This 3 volume collection is a must have for Civil War fans. Shelby Foote does a terrific job at describing all aspects of the battlefield conflicts: the terrain, the strategies of the commanders, and even the feelings of the soldiers who fought. For a series of this length, it reads like a good novel; there were times I couldn't put it down."
5,Maisy's Winter Fun takes the Gold,"Maisy loves Christmas, and this video helped introduce Christmas traditions and fun to my 3 year old. Maisy builds a snow mouse. Can you spot the real Maisy? Fun like this will keep any small child asking to see it again. Like all the Maisy products, this is a winner. I recommend buying Maisy's Christmas (book) as a companion."
4,Made of Water,"Excellent CD. Wait until you hear the 2nd song (3rd trackI think). It's dynamite. The whole thing is VERY good.I'd give it 5 stars except there is more talking in the middlethan I care for.This is an easy listening CD. Yeah, it's a little pricey, butit's definetely a keeper. Well worth the money."
5,"What is that, I haven't a Clue to what that is?","I Love Lucy, she's the Very Best in my Opinion. I'm glad that I have this Show, Lucy is # 1 in my Book, and she Always will be # 1."
5,The Lucy Show. Complete unedited shows that are remastered and fully restored.,Finally the Lucy Show Gets the Deluxe Treatment. For years we had to suffer with bad quality public domain versions of the Lucy Show. But now CBS is finally opening up the vaults and restoring these classic shows from the original master tapes. Every episode is full length and remastered and restored. In Season 4 we lose Vivian Vance and the kids from the original years are long gone. Gale Gordon and Lucy still manage to carry the show and the laughs are still there. If you have the other years you will definitely not be disappointed in season 4. I would highly recommend it! Very High Quality.
4,Falling apart.,"This is where the show starts to fall apart. Yes, Lucy is still great. And Gale Gorden is wonderful. But without Vivian Vance, the show is lacking. I even miss the kids. This is the point where the show goes into the realm of the psycholdilc and just strange. I must admit I love the colors and the VERY late 60's almost hippie look to it. It gets even worse (Better in the next season). For the next three seasons Lucy tries several side kicks and only Carol Burnett can hold a candle to Viv."
1,Ultimately a terrible camera,"I really wanted to like this camera. The hardware team did a great job and the camera has great features: pan/tilt, automatic iris, low light feature, capture to SD card, weather proof case...However, the software team ruined everything. The firmware (the internal software that runs all the camera's functions) is worthless. Half the time the camera just doesn't respond. It requires constant rebooting to get even basic usage out of it. Because it's so unreliable and buggy, it makes the camera worthless for security or anything useful.Tech support is non-existant. Their support webpage doesn't work (errors when you try to view the knowledgebase, for example). I'm a software developer and have been trying to get an SDK (basically instructions on how to program the camera) from their developer link, but they have never responded to me."
2,"great image quality, buggy hardware/software","I fell in love with the image quality and the low light capabilities of this camera. However, I had to return it after I spent hours trying to get it to work reliably to no avail.However, I found out that Toshiba is coming out with a new software release for this, but better yet, they are coming out with the IK-WB15A which is an improved version of the 11A. They claim that they fixed the hardware and software bugs. Unfortunately you're still stuck with ActiveX for viewing, but if you use Internet Explorer you should be fine. The IK-WB21A also looks promising (albeit expensive) but I am not sure if it too suffers from the same issues the 11A had. I can't wait to try the IK-WB15A. Let's hope that Toshiba fixed the bugs. If they did they'll own the market !!"
5,Matches my set,"Nothing beats Pfaltzgraff and this product is no exception. Larger than expected, quick service and I got free shipping. I have not been disappointed with Amazon or Pfaltzgraff."
5,Back to buy it again!!!!,I have had to purchase this book several times!!!! Everyone who sees it on the coffee table seems to permanently borrow it from me. This is one of those books you need to keep an eye on or it will walk out with your next guest! I suggest you use one of those chains the bank uses to keep their pens from being stolen.
5,sweet and funny. worth reading twice.,"Jones manages to make you laugh out loud and also gets you thinking. the recipes are interesting,although I wish he said a little something about each restaurant. The poems by his mom? a great idea! what's next??"
5,We all need an overeducated vegetable delivery boy next door,"Had I not been laughing so hard I would have finished the book sooner. After a box of tissues and quite a few deep breaths I was done. I can not wait to attempt some of the recipes! I think we've all known a Doug Jones growing up. How refreshing to see that some people are not only willing to laugh at themselves, but invite us to join in. It's also nice to see that with some hard work and a few snacks we do make progress. This book was a joy and a privilege to read!"
5,Ashok Nair,"I find this book inspiring, though tinged with tragedy. Inspiring because it contains some excellent original art and poetry by the very talented Bernhard Pock. Tragic because it was published as a memorial after his early death from AIDS. Pock was the son of Nancy Kwan who contributes a short introduction. The poetry is observational and philosophical. The artwork, ranging from sketches to photographs of Pock's sculptures, reveal an artist of considerable imagination and vision.Also included are some very eloquent and moving condolence letters sent to Nancy and her partner Norbert Meisel after Bernhard's death.This book and Pock's movie Rebellious stand as his legacy and gift to the world. Well worth checking out."
5,Ty Beanie Oats the Horse,An adorable stuffed animal. We used this as a favor for our daughter's 3rd birthday. I tied big pink bows on all of them. Everyone loved them. Super cute.
3,"Albert Ketelbey ""In a Persian Market""","This was a very poor recording, scratchy and a tin like sound. I have since purchased one from Barnes and Noble which is far superior, a beautiful piece of enjoyment."
2,Less-than-inspiring stories for an early reader...,"My 3-year-old daughter loves everything Care Bears. This book was read once, though, and then set aside. The stories are not well written. The illustrations are from the first generation of Care Bears (where she is obviously familiar with the recent CBS Kewlopolis reincarnation). I was hoping for much more based on the other reviewer. Would have returned the item if it hadn't already been given as a birthday present."
5,A+++,"Great item, incredible price. Fast shipping. Just as described. Very pleased. Thank you~ A+++++++++++"
5,Evil Has Many Faces,"From back of the book: Laura was alone with nowhere to go when she accepted Mrs. Von Braunisch's offer to be her companion. But the job held one strange stipulation. Laura must be ready to travel anywhere with her elderly employer, and at a moment's notice!What followed was a nightmare of fear that took them to Switzerland and Finland in search of a mysterious fortune. But there was more to it than that--as Laura discovered when she herself turned out to be the object of pursuit--and the witness to a deadly, evil masquerade!"
3,Silly but Fun,"This is a silly story, but it's great escape reading. All the escape elements are there -- the life styles of the rich and famous, an improbable story line, and a pleasant ending. This is a great book to take to a vacation cottage -- and leave behind for the next occupant."
2,Good for occasional use. Serious design flaw.,While the Greenlee GT-11 works reasonably well it breaks easily if dropped. The on/off switch breaks and the product is useless. I carry a tester at all times in my shirt pocket and sooner or later it will take a fall. After buying two of these at Home Depot I finally made to a supply house and bought the much superior Fluke product. More resistant to breakage and sweat.
4,Does what it's suppose to,"Excellent product. Greenlee makes a much better tester then all others. Easy to use just simply place to tip near a wire or into a receptical to see if its hot. Recommend to all electricians, durrable also."
3,"not bad, but there are better options","I'm usually a big Lonely Planet fan; they're my default first choice for a guidebook. However, in this case I believe that the Ultimate Guides by Andrew Doughty and Harriett Friedman are a better choice. On two trips to four islands, I've taken the Lonely Planet Hawaii and left it in the suitcase, while the Doughty/Friedman books are now battered and dog-eared. It's not that there's anything wrong with LP Hawaii; it's just not as marvelous as the alternative."
2,Taking this back to the library,"I could barely read any of this book. The type is so tiny and hard to read, and the maps are all grey and difficult to read as well. Everything is just scrunched in there and you have to pore over that map to figure out what the heck you're looking at. They're way too busy. They cram too much detail into one map.Its information is segmented well, and it's good that they list operating hours and prices where they can, but I just can't squint at that little type. The lettering on some of these maps is literally as small as the head of a pin. I'm supposed to be able to whip this out of my backpack on the island and use it as a quick reference tool? This book is going back to the library; I'll just have to find another book to use."
5,Samuel Barber was a fine composer and this music is wonderful,"Barber's music was a wonderful composer, and his collaberation with Menotti produced wonderful operas and music. I own everything that these two men ever producedCarroll Leo Heath"
5,RC frequency remote vs IR frequency remote,"I went from a Ritetemp with an infrared remote(same as tv,dvd,etc remotes), pretty much a line of site remote. It worked kinda, if I got up and pointed it at the thermostat from a foot or two away, again almost a definite line of site remote, which totally defeated my purpose of not having to get up to change the thermostat. This Lux has a radio controlled remote. It ROCKS! It would probably work from out on my patio. Cons? If it had a 1/2 degree temp setting on the temp turn on/off, it couldn`t get much better than that. Another buyer on Amazon mentioned it eating batteries. Mine is too new to know, but that would be a fair trade off for the convienence of this remote, for me. I never ever use dollar store batteries. And rechargeable batteries are usually only about 1.3 volts I think, vs 1.5 volts from an alkaline battery. I highly recomend this unit. ps, I ""think"" you can use up to 3 remotes one thermostat?"
3,Worked great for the 1st year.,"I really loved this thermostat up until last week when the remote stopped working. We have had it 13 months and only got it because we wanted to be able to change the temp while in bed at night. Like others have posted, you cannot tell what the temperature is set at when you are trying to increase or decrease the setting, so that can be a slight pain. But i lived with it because it worked. Now, however, it is making me mad. We changed the batteries in the remote, the lights still come on as if it should be working but it will not work with the main unit. I'm trying to see if there is anything else we can do to solve it, but am disappointed in the remotes lifespan.UPDATE: Customer service called me within 2 hours of e-mailing and they are sending out a new unit and remote which should be here in a couple days. Fabulous customer service and hopefully the second remote will last longer."
2,Remote doesn't work,"I bought this bc my thermostat is upstairs and it is hard for me to get upstairs. I read the reviews about how the remote works from one room to another. I stood on the first floor, in front of the stairs, pointing that remote control towards the thermostat and nothing happened. If I had known that the remote control doesn't work from standing 15 steps below the thermostat, I would not have bought it at all."
5,BETTER THAN ADVERTISED,"GREAT PRODUCT !! CONTAINS MORE FEATURES THAN ADVERTISED. I WOULD HAVE PAID $50 MORE FOR THESE FEATURES. EASY TO INSTALL. EASY TO PROGRAM IF YOU USE THE ""COPY"" FEATURE THAT ISN'T PROMINENTLY FEATURED IN THE INSTRUCTIONS. SINCE I'M RETIRED, I HAVE THE SAME EVERYDAY SCHEDULE. I DIDN'T BOTHER WITH THE PROGRAMMING. I JUST SET A TEMPERATURE, PUT IT ON VACATION HOLD, AND USE THE REMOTE TO CHANGE AS CONDITIONS CHANGE. IE. 74 AT NIGHT, 76 DURING THE DAY. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ! ! !"
4,Remote Control Saves Day,I purchased this thermostat so my wife could control the heat in the morning which is directed right towards her from the ceiling. The remote enables her to turn it off once it gets too hot upstairs and not have to wait until downstairs heats up since we only have one thermostat for both levels. We are very happy with its performance the only thing we noticed is that the remote has a delay so she has to push the button wait and then push the button and wait to lower it by a couple of degrees. This is only a minor issue and beats having to get up out of bed and go downstairs to adjust it.
1,Eats batteries,It is very annoying to wake up to no heat and to replace the batteries every 2 months.
3,"It is powered ONLY by batteries, NOT 24 volt ac.","Despite the claim that ""it's compatible with most 24-volt heating and air conditioning systems"", this thermostat is NOT powered by the 24 volt transformer. It is powered ONLY by batteries - and I am NOT referring to the remote control; I'm referring to the thermostat itself. The ""C"" wire (common transformer wire) CANNOT be used. I think this fact should be declared in the description."
2,Problem,"We're still testing, but this thermostat does not seem to turn on the heat in the morning when it should."
5,Best deal for the money,"Checked out many thermostats with remote before buying this unit... By far the best for the money... Easy to install, takes 10 minutes and works like a $300.00 unit... Life is good..."
2,Disappointed,"The thermostat works, but:1. Very slow to respond when I raise or lower the HOLD temperature.2. Display is tiny - temperature and time are readable except when backlit, and the day of the week is too small and faint to read at all."
2,Very Poor Remote Control Reception,Lux makes a good unit overall but the range for the remote control is 25 feet at most and this is almost line of site. Quite unfortunate.
2,thermostat,can't figure out to program it & when it's cold I have to get up in the middle of thenight to raise the temp
4,LUX thermostat,"Lux TX9000RF Programmable Thermostat with RemotePurchased this product strictly for the ability to remotely control the temperature on the thermostat. The convenience of controlling my furnace from my bedroom is worthwhile. Also the programmable thermostat is easy to install & program. This product more than met my expectations. Unfortunately the unit stopped working after a year. The remote and thermostat were unable to ""communicate"" with each other. Contacting LUX customer service, they confirmed the warranty was still valid & shipped a new unit within a few days. Great customer service."
4,Good product but needs an added feature,"I think this is my favorite Christmas present. Works like a charm. A display window is needed on the remote to show what temperature user is increasing or decreasing. 5 stars for concept, 3 stars for price, and 3 stars for missing element of the needed temp-change display window. Overall score: 3.5 stars (Although there is no way to mark it myself.)"
4,Fair Deal,"Fully met the expectations and has been performing well. My wife is happy with it, so is the family. Yes, I would recommend it to anyone without reservations."
4,My wife has been using this for years with no problem,We purchased this blade quite a few months ago and have been using it without a problem about once or twice a week. Fit perfectly in our cuisinart and never had trouble.
2,Cuisinart replacement blade for food processor,"They don't make them anymore as 20 years ago. The blade is thinner, and the cutting part of the blade is poorly finished. Disappointing!"
2,Review from a 11-Year-Old Boy,"As I started this book I didn't have high expectations so I may not have gotten as much out as some people. It had a few exciting parts but they were scattered. I didn't feel connected to the characters so when they died, I said, ""Who was that?"" I gave this book only two stars because I did not think it was very exciting."
5,A peek into the violent past of northern Britain,"I found this book to be a greatly entertaining and informative work. It is based on the ""Gododdin"" (pronounced Godothen), the oldest written tale to come out of northern Britain. It is written as a narrative, told by a shieldbearer in the service of an aging king. This king wishes to reform the ""Celtic Arrow"", an elite fighting force consisting of 300 knights and their respective pair of shieldbearers in order to repel the encroaching Saxons. If you like history and/or tales of the sword, this is a must read...Enjoy!"
3,Basic concepts,"The book may be a reference for beginners in the field with no exposure to the community. If you have a minimum background, tou may want to check this work upfront, since4 it may be less specific than what you may be looking for. Having said that, it is not easy to write relevant works in the field, since readers from different industries may have very different expectations."
3,Comprehensive and informative,"This is a very comprehensive and informative book on the origins of the Latino market with a lot of data backing up the research. If you want statistics and history-if you want to know how to grow your business in the US Hispanic market, you might want to try another book on marketing."
4,The ugliest beanie baby I've ever seen.,"Don't get me wrong- I intentionally purchased this beanie for my pre-schoolers' class even after I saw the picture of it. In person it is even uglier. However, his class needed an animal beanie that started with the letter V for their alphabet, so vulture it is. The yellowish-orange eyes don't help. Overall, it is well made and durable enough to become a classroom object. Just pretty darn ugly."
5,Fantastic,"I went to a gourmet store and asked for their ""Chocolate Expert"" to recommend a chocolate among the high-end makers. He pointed out this brand, which was affordable as well as incredibly flavorful. If you need a chocolate to melt in your mouth, savor the Santander 53% cocoa."
3,Let's stick to the facts,"I watched the Documentary when it first came out and it was interesting. However, the Rosenberg's were Soviet spies - Ethel's husband and brother were spies.Her granddaughter, the film maker, opined on the HBO site that Ethel was a spy. Let passed nuclear weapons info to the Soviet Union. Should they have been executed? I'm not sure but I don't have much sympathy for them."
5,Great Christmas music!,"If you're looking for Christmas albums, you should consider this one. I highly recommend it. I love the song Holiday and listen to it year round. The only Christmas albums better than this one are Manhiem Steamroller!"
1,Disappointed,I cannot get this product to work.It does not come with documentation or software.I went ot web sites and downloaded the recommended driver but it still does not work.I have to wonder if this is a proprietary product and was not listed as such.It is an expensive error that I regret purchasing.
4,"I think the other reviewer needed a ""cooling down"" period","...before writing that review. The sound on these discs might not be ideal, but it is not bad enough to warrant one star. I've heard worse transfers of ""historical recordings,"" and still found them to be quite listenable. Yes, it's true that there is quite a bit of surface noise, but once the orchestral sound rises above that, it is quite firm and clear. Yeah, the Naxos set has less surface noise, but it seems to me that the sound also has a bit more ""glare,"" and a bit less depth, and I hear more flutter in some places.If you find the Pearl/Opal set cheap in a used CD bin, or on the Marketplace, go ahead and grab it: my personal feeling is that both it, and the Naxos, have their merits."
5,Best coffee,I love this coffee. I could drink this everyday and never get tired of it. It has just the right amount of vanilla flavoring and a smooth taste.
2,What Happened?,"I have been using SONY DVD+R Discs for recording for years. I have previously never had problems with ""un-recordable"" discs. With this spindle every other disc is un-recordable according to my DVD Recorder. Cannot figure out what happened? At this rate my trash can will have more discs than I will have successfully recorded."
5,Good DVD Deal,What is important is a good price and fast shipping. You can't go wrong with Sony. They make excellent products and ALWAYS stand behind there product. I would buy from this seller again.
5,It works for me,I have Magnavox DVD Recorders. Some dvd's just don't work well in these machines. Sony has allways performed best for me.
3,Bad Sony DVD's,I bought a whole bundle of Sony DVD's and I have gone through around 10 and have only found one that woudl burn. Why is this? Money down the drain. I'm just now getting around to using them. My return has expired. So now I'm stuck with a bad batch of DVD's.
1,Unable to Burn Discs,"I bought a 50 pack of these Sony discs and the first five won't even burn. It says they have a two-year warranty, but I can't find my receipt. I purchased either at Staples or Wal-Mart and not from Amazon. (Someone else posted that you have to pay to ship them back to Sony, so don't know if it will be worth the cost/trouble.) I was burning other discs before (no problem), and I just tried another Verbatim one (no problem) after the Sony ones would not burn. I don't recommend these discs. I'll keep trying, but since the first five don't work, I am not optimistic about the rest."
1,"i agree, they SUCK!!","right now i can't even get my burner to open because one of these dvd's is in it, caused an error while burning... now, stuck. i thought for a few days that my burner was broken, but figured out that it is the sony dvd's... i don't get it either because my dvd burner is also sony, you would think they would be compatible. i am so annoyed that i bought two big stacks of these..."
1,Horrible,"I have used HP, TDK, Fujifilm, and JVC blank DVD's and have had no problems. But when I tried these Sony DVD's all I got were problems. They suck. A lot of other people seem to say that these are good. But for me, I'm using an HP Lightscribe DVD Burner and these DVD's suck. They do not work. Don't waste your money on these. If I could give this product 0 stars I would."
2,This rating is for Fox DVD only . Not the movies,"When I installed Laura kept getting a commentary all during the movie was very unhappy ready to send back as could not see where to turn the movie on.Then I installed Call Northside 777 the movie started right away.I found in special features an on/off Commentary switch-guess Fox left iton for Laura-its off now was hard to find with the DVD for Laura as the print was so light so if you purchase this DVD and don't get just the movie you now know what to do, unless you like someone talking all through the movie!As for the movies themselves very good."
3,sanding block,"works fine as a sanding block. Connection to vacume it cheap and will not stay connected while sanding, I had to wrap it with duct tape to make it functional, even then it only reduced dust it didnt eliminate it."
5,Women's Rights,This is the best movie. It was inspiring to see what women had to go through to get us the right to vote. Everyone should see this movie. It is great!
4,Iron-Jawed Angels,"This is a true story of a few women mobilizing an army of suffragettes in 1915-1919 to fight for the right to vote. When they were told to 'take it to the states' they did just that, organizing into localized units led by a Nationwide message for a constitutional amendment. They were reviled, brutalized, put in jail and denied access to the outside world. This HBO movie won a standing ovation at the Sundance Film Festival, and is an excellent reason for women to exercise their hard-fought right to vote. This film will stay with you for a while."
5,Iron Jaw Angels,I think this film should be required to be shown to every student (boy and girl)in High School. These women sacrificed deeply for women's rights.
5,Important for female youth to know.,"A documentary of truth. Well done. Obviously there is more work to be done on equality. Recommend to all, especially social studies classes."
3,Women's Right to Vote,"I must admit that even though I liked the idea of this movie and the women it portrayed that struggled for women to have the right to vote that I was disappointed in some of the modern language and scenes unnecessary with too much skin showing. I had hoped to show it to my students, but after pre-viewing it I decided not to, because of the previously stated factors."
5,A true triumph for womens rights,"Even since I heard about this movie, I was excited about it. When I finally watched the whole thing, which took me four tries on HBO, I was not disappointed. This movie not only gives an accurate representation of the suffragettes in the early 1900s but it also inspires women of today and speak to them. The movie does not spare us in details of how the women are treated when imprisoned for picketing on the White House during the first world war. It was a brave move. It also shows the humanity of these women. They are not just sqwuaking birds making noise. They had their own lives. I truly recommend this movie to everyone."
4,Women's Purpose,If any women are in need of an inspiring movie to lift them off the couch this would be it. I loved this movie! The story of Alice Paul is not very well known and it is absolutely amazing. Hilary Swank and Patrick Dempsey were amazing in it. It made me want to do something more for our gender as it will do to many.
5,"""Iron Jawed Angels"" An inspiring historical time period film !","""Iron Jawed Angels"" takes you back in time to the 1920s time period in a film about women getting the right to vote under President Woodrow Wilson. This women suffrage film gives the viewer a look at what actually went on with the suffragist and how hard they worked for women's rights.I was inspired by this film and everyone I know who has seen it agrees. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves to know about historical events and who are curious about women's political movements in history."
3,Iron Jawed Angels,"Appreciated the historical info, but agree with others that the music was wrong, I think some of the attitudes were not portrayed accurately for the time period. And there was a totally inapropriate and unneccessary scene that was offensive. I get sick of the Hollywood take on everything. I could have been a great movie."
3,Iron Jawed Angels,"This movie gives a general overview of the final struggle of women to secure their right to vote. Although it is historically accurate, the movie covers a lot of material quickly. I would recommend reading up on the suffrage movement before watching the film."
5,Iron Jawed Angels - movie,"This was an excellent movie. All people need to know the suffering that went into achieving voting in America for women. Today, women have forgotten what suffering these women went through in order to achieve a law stating that women in America could vote. We all need to study the issues and vote. To live in this great country and have the freedoms that we have, requies the participation of all Americans. Please watch this movie. It is truthful and marvelously portrayed by the actors. Everyone, especially women, should see this movie now. The price is right, buy it!"
5,A great reminder,"Until now, Wilson was the most Progressive president we had. This movie is an excellent reminder that progressives seek control and not the justice they profess they seek."
4,Iron Jawed Angels,"I have seen this movie and dearly loved it. That is why I am trying to purchase it. I ordered it 3-17-09 and still have not received it. I do recommend the movie to everyone. I wish my teenage grandchildren to see it as well. There are two quick parts that did not need to be in the movie and I hope to devert their attention so that they won't see it. 1. Two girls do a quick kiss and 2. a bathtub scene where the main person quickly pleasures herself. These did not need to be in there. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars, as it is one great movie."
5,Awesome movie,"This movie is fantastic. I took a Women's Studies class for the first time last semester and we watched a small clip of this film and I just had to buy it for myself so I could see the rest. It was well worth it. I am so thankful to women like these that paved the way and made it possible for me to vote, be in college, use birth control, or even just have a job!"
4,Very good...but not for anyone under 18!,"My adult daughter and I rented this movie because of reading the many good reviews about it. We loved it! Immediately afterward I hopped on my computer to order it, however it was either out of stock or triple the list price on every site I looked at. I finally ordered it from Amazon.com knowing that it would be a few weeks before I recieved it. To my delight, it came within a week!My only problem with this movie is one particular scene (I'll not describe it here) that makes it totally inappropriate for anyone under 18 to watch. Even though I think it is an important scene and helps the viewer understand the character better, it is a shame it is in there because it limits its audience. I think young teens could have gotten a lot out of this film.Bottom line....This movie showcases a very important message, particularly for young women voting in the 2008 Presidential election, but be aware of the adult situations!"
4,Good for historical film,"Well-done docudrama. Kind of slow moving in parts, but generally well done. It brings home the hardships faced by these truly brave women. Can't say that I would have done what they did. All women should buy this to show to their daughters.Only negative was that it took almost a month to receive. The post office apparently lost the package for a few weeks."
5,A fresh look at a slice of history. Allstar cast!,"I loved this movie! This is one of those rare movies that you can watch over and over. The modern/vintage blend of this film gives it an elevated intrigue. I loved everything about this movie-- the cinematography, acting, music, the story itself. A fresh look at a piece of American History."
2,Boring,"This movie is incredibly boring. It was recommended by a Facebook link that showed suffragettes who'd been beaten, starved and jailed. I'm halfway through it and have seen nothing to do with the FB link. I don't think I'm going to make it the rest of the way."
4,Swank Shines,Hillary Swank brings life to this movie and tells a story that we've all learned about since grade school in an engaging performance.
5,Excellent,"The actors were superb. It was an engaging movie - I wondered if it was entirely true, but if it was, all women need to go out and vote!!!"
3,"great story, pretty good movie",Translating great historical stories into movies is not always an easy task. This does a pretty good job. It is largely accurate. And you get the essence of how tough these women were.
3,"Fantastic story, just not told that great","I so looked forward to seeing this movie, not only for the event it depicted, but the opportunity to see so many strong women actors given a meaty story to portray. But, I found the actual conflict of woman's rights minimalized. Instead of showing the conflict between the various suffrage groups as different in how they see their roles to men, the conflict was stereotyped as a power play. The introduction of Alice Paul's possible suitor provided a Hollywood motivation, but didn't really give any depth to Alice's character. I was pleased to see that this story was finally put on film, but it could have shown so much more... so, rent, don't buy."
5,Heart Wrenching,"Iron Jawed Angels is a movie ALL women, young and old should see. It really opened my eyes to how hard fought the battle to win the vote for women was. After watching this movie, I will never again take for granted the right to vote!Sharon Hill, Albuquerque, NM"
5,Iron Jawed Angels,"I first saw Iron Jawed Angels as part of Women's History Month (March) and I was completely overcome by its intensity. This is a film which should be shown to every girl as she reaches voting age. It made me proud to be a woman. In the film, which is fact, not fiction, we see what it took to get the right to vote as far as women are concerned. It is done very well - at times it is hard to look it - it is not some pretty little film about dainty women. I was thrilled to be able to obtain a copy for me and one for my friend who was equally blown away by it."
2,"great movie, terrible video",I played the video on four different DVD players. Sound volume is inadequate. It plays like a knock off.
2,Could have been much better.,I applaud this film for reminding us of how hard people have fought for rights we take for granted. It also reminds us that scummy politicians (including presidents) are not a new phenomenon.The film has some real problems too. The modern music is a disaster. Its pretty weird and distracting to be listening to electric guitars tied to scenes which occurred before they were invented. Another bad idea is the repeated use of multiple images with looped sound. This stuff looks like parts of a deranged music video accidently spliced in.
1,Not-so-happy,"These particular strings didn't seem suited for my Epiphone Acoustic Bass. Very tinny, almost modulated quality to the sound that I found odd."
5,Amazingly transformed my bass,After trying the OEM strings and another brand of strings I was still ready to return my recently acquired acoustic bass. Enter a message board post on a bass guitar board referencing these strings helping bring theirs to life. I bought these and they are amazing! They literally transformed my bass into a nice instrument I can enjoy hearing/playing. Highly recommend these strings for acoustic basses.
4,Dustbuster on steroids,"This is a great little vacuum, especially for the price (substantially cheaper than many of the other stick brooms). It's the same basic technology as Dustbuster-type cordless hand vacs, and is actually shaped like one but with a wide floor nozzle and a long handle. However, being corded, it's quite a bit more powerful than the cordless vacs, and has proven quite up to the tasks we use it for (most often, vacuuming the crud off the floor around the baby's high chair). Don't expect this to replace your main house vacuum, but it's a great spot vac to keep handy in those rooms that need a *lot* of vacuuming; we'll probably buy one or two more to stash around the house."
2,Just a dust-buster,"on a stick. Cannot recommend this ""broom vacuum"" because it's nothing special, not a lot of power, and too fat to really get under / into places that a smaller vacuum/dust-buster should get. Forget it."
3,Takes Too Long,Love the design/look of the Faberware Toaster Oven. Oven works great but it takes too long to toast!
1,Buyer Beware,"This product is a fire hazard an should be removed from the market, before some is hurt or killed. ""Do not buy this toaster oven.""My wife was toasting some bread and had the timer set, well she went downstairs to put laundry in the dryer and came back upstairs to find the toaster oven on fire. Luckly I was able to get the toaster oven outside before it caught our house on fire and as it is the smoke damage was bad.We are still cleaning up after the mess."
1,Going back after catching fire !!,Be very careful with this product - the 1st time I use it - It caught fire and could of burnt down the house if not caught in time.
3,toaster oven,I like the toaster oven but the only thing that I didn't reolized was it doesn't let you know when its done..
1,Good only if you like burnt toast,"Don't waste your money. I was very disappointed in the toaster part of this product.As everyone states, the timer dial is not precise and sometimes gets stuck, leading to many slices of burnt toast.Not just the cost of the toast, it's also the wasted time - I spend a lot of time waiting in front of the toaster to ensure the toast does not burn."
2,Wrong item,"I returned this item when it arrived as the wrong thing. I made the order with 3 left in stock. But I guess they ran out and attempted to swap it with another product. If they don't have an item in stock, they should just write a letter of apology and refund the money back. Instead, I had to pack the rug up and drive over to UPS to ship the wrong item back to the seller. Quick refund got them 2 stars, but beware! I ended up getting the correct rug off of ebay. It had to ship from China which took longer, but if I would have ordered from ebay in the first place, my family member whould have had her present on Christmas day."
1,Incorrect Rug,The same thing just happened to me as above. There are still items in stock and I received the wrong item. Do not buy from these people.
2,It's a bait and switch book,"If you thought you'd get an interesting look at the technologies behind global surveillance systems then this is NOT your book. Granted there must be limited access to this sort of information but the title leads you to beleive that the author really has some serious inside info. The books veers of wildly into free speech court cases and eventually the hidden political agenda becomes very clear. On top of this the author's technical knowledge seems lacking..for example he equates a computer ""cookie"" as a program....which it of course is not...it is simply a text file that can be used for many legitimate purposes. I cannot recommend this book."
2,Unqualified author,"Signals intelligence is a technical and complicated field. Besides standard intelligence techniques, it involves mathematics, engineering and politics. Keefe manages to cover remarkably little of this. Instead he focuses on speculative theories and nearly irrelevant current event news headlines. Perhaps the lack of information is not too surprising given how most modern information in this field is classified by various organizations, but what Keefe comes up with is hardly appropriate for a book.There is some decent information to be found, but the bottom line is that Keefe comes across as a college kid on a writing assignment for his school paper."
1,I Traded the Book,"I bought this book after hearing the author interviewed. The interview indicated a knowledge/proof of certain technologies. Once in the book however, I found that the author did not provide much of either. He read alot into 'no comment' answers from government sources. If they refused to comment, then the answer is likely yes. I was looking for specifics on technology that is used to spy, specifics on successes/failures and other 'provable' items, I got alot of speculation and innuendo. I was disapointed in the book and would not recommend it to others, in fact I took the book on a vacation and once I read it, I went to the resort's book exchange and traded it for something else. A free copy is available in Mazatlan!"
5,Fabulous Book,Very interesting book. It covers a lot of the history of signal operations. And goes into how well all the snooping works. He show examples both pro and con. Very well written. It keeps you wanting more.
1,The Worst Book about NSA,"I have read them all, and this text sounds familiar--because it is just a rehash that appears to be borrowed from interpretations already published and facts already in the public domain. Nothing new, no new insights. Author brings relatively little to table in terms of policy understanding and his own sources. Bamford's books are far superior."
1,Bogus,"This book, after the opening tour through england, leaves us with nothing to capture about the NSA. He writes well as a university student. But his research could have been obtained in a salon reading Bamford's books; nothing new. I was surprised when nothing is said of Israel's communication links, or with Britain's, since he alludes to MI 5 frequently, conduct in Ireland. Much is missing from this first book...it may help with his tuition with his timing."
5,informative AND entertaining,The author of this book accomplishes the unusual feat of crafting a work of non-fiction that is both a primer on government surveillance in the post-modern world and in incredibly entertaining chronicle of his adventures (and misadventures) as he attempted to research the subject. I couldn't put it down.
5,Chicanita,Jessie I just want to tell you how much I admire you.This CD is great. Estoy muy orgullosa de ti. Espero un dia pueda ser cantante como tu. Que tengas mucha suerte en tu vida y carera. Tambien espero que un dia te pueda conoser en persona. Viva Mexico!!
5,5 Star Cd,"This is a great cd remembering our great and famous Chalino Sanchez who sang those rancheras and corridos for us. Now ""El Original De La Sierra a young, nice, & handsome man with a great voice singing and remembering Chalino Sanchez."
1,boring,holy boring book of death. this book was bland beyond bland. the artwork selected for this book was the only thing good about it. if you want to be put to sleep then read this book. if you want to learn more about torture and the inquisitions then read something else.
2,Weak information,Job Loss has the potential of being a great start for a book. There is just not enough strong information to justify this book. I'm surprised it got published.
4,NoT bAd At AlL!!!,"I first heard of this band on the web while i was lookin for christian metal bands that sounds like secular metal bands. when i came across their name, it was next to ""pantera"". sooo, i had to check it out. so i went to youtube to check out a few tracks and from wat i haeard, it sounded pretty good. the singer had more of a james hetfield ""black album"" era vocal. the video i watched on youtube displayed the cover of this album, E.D. III, but was actually playing songs from their self titled 2005 release. so i was a little disapointed. but i just got the cd today and i gotta say, i'm impressed!!! not really the kind of metal i like but still good. this album kinda had like a Avenged Sevenfold feel, with almost like a Korn sounding crunch in the guitar and just a little bit of that james hetfeild vocal. and the lyrics are pretty good too. so yeah, if ur a fan of Numetal, this would be a good album for u. but if ur more into thrash type metal u probably wont like this."
4,Nice compact unit,"Nice compact electronic distributor, I can't comment on it's performance because it will not be placed in service till after the engine is built."
3,bueno pero breve,El concierto fue espectacular y el DVD lo representa. El problema es que al menos el DVD que compré yo por Amazon (no se si hay más de un tipo disponible) NO ES EL CONCIERTO ENTEROOOOOOOOOOOOO. Como tengo el CD se que hay muchas más canciones que NO están incluídas en el DVD... gran decepción!!!! Si alguien conoce otra versión de DVD con el recital entero agradecería que me lo digan. De todas formas la parte del concierto que muestran en este DVD es genial.
3,Excelente e Incompleto,"Compre el Dvd, pero esta incompleto, porque un amigo mio, tiene el mismo pero com otras canciones, por respeto y honrradez lo compre original, pero creo que el de mi amigo esta mas completo, creo que lo editaron el que compre y la verdad hay canciones que me fascinan pero no las tengo, alguien puede decirme donde comprar el DVD del concierto completo?"
2,Biggest Hits?,"These were mostly not the songs I remember as his biggest hits. A couple of them were familiar, but overall I was disappointed."
2,combining words and + and x signs does not poetry make,"Illustrations are great, poppingly bright and fun.But what is it? Who is it for?It won't hold children's attention, and it can'thold up in the classroom -- it isn't math, and itisn't poetry. Certainly not poetry. A few thoughts, words,and multiplication signs thrown together on the pagesdoesn't make it a worthy read. It becomes rather boringrather quickly with each page."
1,RIP OFF,You are NOT buying the whole series... just one dvd in the series for anywhere between 40 - 300 dollars! FOR A SINGLE DVD! Do not fall to this gimmic!
3,A mixed bag,"Basically a CD for enthusiasts--sound quality ranges from fair to dire, and you have to take into account that for some of these the pianist was into his nineties. The sound is best for the Diabellis,the 3 Chopin pieces, and the short J. S. Bach excerpt which are also I think the best performances in the set. The Diabellis are sometimes rather rough-going but have moments of exquisite beauty; the latter description also applies to the short Bach excerpt.To my mind almost worth the price of the set in themselves are the three Chopin pieces all in arresting, completely ""un-frilly"" performances.Caveat emptor with regard to sound quality, but there's worthwhile stuff on these discs."
5,Great tool to assist with situps,I saw these for the first time at the Crossfit gym I go to. We use them exclusively for doing situps. Being a big guy I struggle to do situps unless someone is holding my feet down. This thing eliminates that need completely.I fills the gap that is created between your lower back an the floor as you do situps and you can get a lot of leverage from that. I can do situps alone without anchoring my feet. My back doesn't get strained and I can focus more on my abs. Glad I bought this.
4,Great tool,"If you think this is good way to get great abs it is, but you still have to work hard and diet right. This is not magic. It is a great tool and you can work your abs better than without it."
4,Abmat works!,"Just got my Ab mat and it is surprisingly effective for such a simple item. I bought it because I hoped it would support my lower back and prevent injury, however it does more than that. It makes you fully stretch your abs before you sit up, giving you a full range of motion contraction. It still supports my back and the sit ups seem easier somehow."
3,Not as advertised,"Length:: 0:28 MinsI expected this product to be more like the equipment I use at CrossFit. It is definitely not as advertised. I didn't view the DVD yet, but I don't really need or want that anyway. The product should work out okay for home use, but they really should be more honest about the product that they are ACTUALLY shipping."
4,Weak Abs Getting Stronger,"I have been very please to finally be able to do abs without stress on my lower back. I have noticed not only an improvement in my ab strength, but fewer aches in my lower back during other activities."
5,it LOOKS simple enough...,"Aside from a Glute-hamstring developer, it's really the only piece of abdominal equipment you would ever need to buy. Sure, you could replicate the extension effect it gives you with a rolled up towel, but this is a solid, useful piece of equipment that is totally worth the price.If you've never tried crunches on this thing, take a towel or two, roll them up and put them under your lumbar and do a few crunches. This allows your abs to reach their full range of motion unlike when you lay flat on the floor. The effect is pretty substantial.also, CROSSFIT FOR THE WIN BABY!"
3,Where's my DVD,It's been a little while since I purchased this item; I also failed to receive my DVD.As matters stand I find this to be an adequate accessory but leg raises and L sits are far more efficient for core training.
3,"Overpriced, and not that great for its intended use","Honestly, I can't really tell if there's any real advantage to using versus nothing at all, versus just a small rolled up towel under my butt, while doing floor ab exercises.I *do* know that this darn thing should not be sold for more than $20 or even $15, since from the looks of it I'll bet it cost some sweatshop in China maybe $2 labor and materials combined. Oh well, will just have to wait until some cheap knock-off version of it hits the shelves at Wallyworld.OTOH, this Abmat works pretty well in an office chair---the curved shape aligns your back in the same way that sitting on a Swedish ball would, without the unwieldy and rather unsightly disadvantages of the Swedish ball. It's definitely cheaper than buying a Swedish ball chair like thisGaiam Balance Ball Chairand certainly cheaper than using a Bosu ballBosu Balance Trainer Home Versionon a normal chair. I just might try using this in my car on my next long road trip..."
3,"Not comfortable, a towel would work better","Looking for something to use instead of an exercise mat for crunches, but this just isn't it. It's not very comfortable and doesn't support my back well. I'm better off with a folded towel."
5,Love it.,"I used one of these when I was taking cross fit classes and loved it then. I'm back at a more traditional gym (due to scheduling difficulties) and missed the Abmat - so I bought my own and take it with me. Easily portable, gives great back support and is very effective."
5,Great back support,"Using it at crossfit showed me how much support I could get for my back while getting more range of motion at the same time. I bought it to use at home on rest days to keep the core strong and it's working so far. I completed 200 sit-ups in our Barbara WOD the other day, which I couldn't do a few months ago. I don't use the dvd or guide, I just use it and do the exercises. The best part is that it's small, light, and an inexpensive way to keep the abs working."
1,rew068,Cannot properly review this item since it arrived and did not work. The unit was checked again with another fuse but it still did not work. I suspect that the circuit board is bad.... Oh well !!!!
1,Does not work for the ONYX'S Cradle!,"I received two of these. Both of them did not work like they were instructed to. I bought this as a set (antenna, cradle, and the power cord as amazon suggested and said that it would work for the onyx). Well they were wrong! I am going to try and custom fit it in my self and see if I can replace the metal (power) piece in the cradle with the one on this power adapter, as they are the same size and should with if I try that."
1,Does not work with power connect dock.,"The package offered from Amazon.com for the Power connect dock, antenna and power cord, do not. Work together as suggested in the ad. I purchased it as a set and when arrived would not plug together. When I called Amazon to return thy power cord, they would not make it right, only suggested I should purchase the correct power cord."
3,Didnt work with my XMp3i Portable Satellite Radio,"Shipping wasnt as quick as others experienced, but not slow enough for me to complain about. I was disappointed to discover this charger doesnt work with the XMp3i Portable Satellite Radio. It will plug into the device as a stand alone. However, in the car to use the antennae the cradle must be attached. This plug didnt fit the port in the cradle. :("
3,Not for the Roady,This adaptor will NOT work with the Roady or Roady2 radios. There is no mention of this and I had to return it as the connection does not fit.
5,Great replacement product for original equipment that stopped working,"It's only been a few weeks, but so far this replacement car power adapter for XM Inno has worked great. In my opinion it's worth it for the low price as compared to the replacement cost for original equipment."
4,Does not work with SkyFi 3,Looks like a good quality unit and at a modest price. Altough listed at another site as compatible it will not work with the SkyFi 3.
1,does not fit the ski fi cradle,it did not fit into the sky fi cradle as advertised. It was part of a package w/ antenna and cradle. it did not work on the cradle.
4,Great to build a solid base,"This book is great for every GA pilot who wants to know more about his airplane. You don't have to be an engineer to understand the concepts, however some chapters are not quite easy to follow without some previous knowledge. The author builds the bridge from the theory to the operation of the aircraft. Highly recommended!"
2,Not enough quilts for me.,This is a beautiful book that contains many gorgeous color photos of flowers. I would have liked to see more about quilts...which is why I bought it.
3,Great for 3 months,"The mic was an excellent buy for the time I had it, It was recommended by several people so I got it. Only thing is the mic only lasted a little over three months. Before it decided to die. Though I couldnt have asked for a better mic, clear quality, excellent noise cancellation and so on, until ofcourse it stopped working :-("
1,DO NOT BUY EVER!!!!!!,"Stopped working after a week. Sound quality is horrible. If you are buying for the microphone, DON'T. People can't understand you. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not compatible with MacBook (Apple),"Beware: Although the product description says ""compatible with Windows, Mac & Linux"", this headset will not work with a MacBook Pro as the Audio line-in port on a Mac only works with microphones that have a preamp. I did not know that, stupid me, but the product description is definitely incorrect."
1,Not mac compatible,"This product is labeled as mac compatible but it is not. If your mac only has a ""line in"" plug (as with most macs), you will need a headset with a USB plug. This product does not have a USB plug."
5,Quality Product,"This is a well made product. You just have to read the directions. The FM modulator does work, but if you are in an urban area the manual does state that it won't work. I have had no problems with this unit. I just wish Blaupunkt did not discontinue it since they had plans to sell a boombox accessory like the Sirius universal boombox. If you have the car kit you can hook it up to the Bosch power box making this Sirius receiver truly portable."
4,Some Nice Pieces Here,"This disc of music by Gustav Holst has the advantage of excellent programming: The St. Paul's and Brook Green Suites, plus Six Morris Dance Tunes all on one album, to say nothing of A Fugal Concerto, In the Bleak Midwinter and Seven Scottish Airs. The playing is energetic, evocative and thoughtful in turns -- my only complaint is that I felt the strings sound a bit ragged in portions of the St. Paul's Suite. That criticism aside, however, this is a very good disc of largely less-well-known Holst works. Between it and the Holst disc conducted by David Lloyd-Jones on Naxos, whose own program does not intersect with this one, you can have a lot of the composer's non-The-Planets works well covered. Recommended."
1,not worth saving the money for,burned everytime i used it. not as lubricating as the original.i did not purchase again. spent the money on the original.
5,Excellent product!,"I have used ophthalmic ointments for several years. In my opinion, this is entirely satisfactory product at a fair price."
2,not exactly,"I received my order of two boxes of the ointment today, with one package seal broken and the other box smashed. My main complaint is that it is not the exact item pictured. The picture shows the product packaged by Akorn, while both package I received were by Major. I have used the Akorn product for several years, with great results. I will have to check the consistency of the Mojor ointment to make sure it will perform as expected. Many years ago I tried Muro. Muro is a much thicker ointment, and does not provide adequate lubrication to the whole eye. While using Muro, I sustained five different abrasions from the eyelid sticking, so I am very aware of differences in products."
2,Not as good as the brand name product,"This product does not compare favorably to Muro 128 ointment. The base is too thick. It actually made my night-time dry eye pain worse, rather than better. Muro 128 works well for me."
2,Not the Same,"I have used Muro 128 ointment for about twenty years now for reoccuring corneal erosions. I was obviously excited when I saw a generic considering the price. I used it and it WAS NOT the same. I had a slight burning in my eyes that I don't get with the Muro brand and like I said with 20 years, I know the feeling of the Muro. I know people use it for pets and stuff and maybe that's okay but for my eyes, I'm gonna pay the extra for the Muro."
1,unhappy customer,"Im not happy someone returned my product yesterday, yet it wasent me i wasent even on the copmuter or this site yesterday...."
1,The Fat Lord Wrote This Himself,"It's just more of the same from the Fat Lord but more brutal--there's a hard-to-watch rape scene that's repeated in slo-mo later on--and all the ""action"" in the film is fast editing and sleazy Euro-trash guys and sleazy Euro-trash women with a script from the FL.No. Really. Maybe people have made enough movies.The only thing that could have made this movie watchable would have been if a giant snake had slithered in and eaten everybody.In one scene one of the FL's cop friends punches a criminal in the stomach and then, stupidly, stands there. The criminal vomits on the cop. I felt as stupid as that cop because this movie pretty much vomits on anyone who watches it."
5,GREAT movie,"Born To Raise Hell, is a return to form for Steven Segal.Excellent Production Values and most importantly a good story.The fight scenes are cutting edge.Excellent Supporting Cast,shot in Bucharest.WideScreen 1.85 Ratio. RecommendedI watched this on Bluray from the U.K. release."
3,Don't be fooled,"For a newborn, there is really no wipes that I saw to prevent diaper rash or sensitivity. My daughter is breast-fed and I hear that makes it even easier for them to have diaper rash. These wipes are good after the baby is a month old or so, but before that, stick with a warm wash clothe."
5,Great for babies with sensitive skin,"I don't have a baby. But these are great for those babies with sensitive skin. So thick, one can take care of a messy baby!"
5,For those who are serious about spiritual growth,"This book is the sequel to ""The Pursuit of Holiness"" and is equally an incredible guide to spiritual growth. It is so rich with instruction that some chapters need to be read and reread, thought through and taken to heart. These two books will admonish you to a committed lifestyle of surrender and obedience as they reveal a sovereign and omnipotent God Who desires our fellowship, and will lavish upon us His love as He directs our path. I've bought several copies of both to give to friends who are seeking God with their whole heart and desire to walk in His Presence and under His direction."
3,It came in on time,It came in on time and in good shape as advertised. They did what they said what they would do.
4,"fine, what I ordered",book came in a timely manner. It was what I ordered. a good used book. it was for someone else.
5,A stand-out book on Christian living,"I purchased this book because it was recommended as a great follow-up to his book In Pursuit of Holiness. I'm glad I followed the recommendation. The Practice of Godliness made me see that all my efforts for God were being done with the wrong motivation.Instead of putting God's honor as my prime motivation for serving Him, I was serving Him to win some sort of victory for myself. I had some sort of internal score card that I could check off.I got so much out of this book that I'm off to read it again."
5,Great Iron!,"It works perfectly! As long as you do very small sections of your hair at a time. My hair is super super curly, thick and very frizzy. This iron is the best! Nothing else has worked on my hair like this Iron, I love it!!"
5,good stuff,"even my chain smoking coffee drinking husband pops these when he gets sick and thats saying alot for our over the top culture... i just started taking them with two health conditons constantly draining my natural defences i'm convinced theres somthing too it, but you'd have to try it yourself to see..."
3,Good book on technical analysis,"This is acutally a very good book, and one of the stronger parts is that the author explains what actually happens during the formation of different patterns. I would give this book 4 stars but the charts are awful - I have NO idea why the author has chosen this format for the charts..."
3,"Not bad, but not great","Definately provides a good review of many TA approaches and I really like how Kamich inputs his personal commentary on the market psychology represented by the charts. The big weakness of this book is the lame charts. Considering this is a TA book, which is all about charts, one would think there would be good examples... There are not! I found myself drawing many of the charts he described. In my oppinion, he should have provided them."
4,Shiv,"A very good introductary book on SOI. But I felt that the SOI device Electrical prperties could have been dealt in greater detail. Neverthless, this book is really good for circuit designers who have just been initiated into the world of SOI."
1,"Broken File, Unusable Screwdriver. Unnecessary Kit!","By the time I bought my 5th harmonica, my C harp was sounding pretty bad. I had tried to scrape all the gunk out of it, but finally spent the money on the harmonica kit. The instructions seem easy enough, but I have serious problems with this item. My Phillips head screwdriver (#1) didn't unscrew anything, one of the files broke when I tried to use it, and I can't seem to effect much of a change on any of my reeds besides snapping them off, which I've now done four times (ouch!). I have used this kit to switch out reeds, but beyond that the files, pick and everything else are completely dead to me. You can use your own #1 screwdriver, needlenose pliers to get your harp apart and back together again with the new reed."
4,Good for the money spent.,Good for the money spent.Makes what is needed even if the tools are not top level quality.I am satisfied with this toolkit.
2,Where is Kondrashin?,"This is poor. When will we have the release on CD of Kondrashin's staggering account originally released on Melodiya LP? I listen to this recording from time to time and it is truly awesome. By comparison, the present recording is pale and dull. Razin is not Shostakovich at his most profound but the emotional power of this music is enormous. Only Kondrashin has so far done it justice on record."
1,try to find another recording,"I have a poor quality of ""The Execution of Stepan Razin"" on tape and that is a my best classical music.first, when i find this i became glad and buy it but when i hear it i am so disappoint.if i hear this execute before my tape i would lost such great music and never searching for it. this recording is very slow and poor.try to find another one and please mail me if you find another recording"
2,"Come back Kondrashin, all is forgiven","What a disappointment this CD is. I too was completely entranced by the Melodiya recording many years ago and have searched and low to find it with absolutely no success. This is a pale imitation of that performance; a leaden solo, a chorus which gives every indication of being dosed up to the eyeballs with Night Nurse and an altogether uninspiring orchestral performance. Will some one tell Melodiya to get their finger out and get that Kondrashin performance back on the shelves! Or in the streets! Anywhere but a deleted catalogue!"
1,This is a terrible recording.,"I have to agree with the review above. I find that it is weaker however. I have an excellent recording on record from the old Angel record company, and it was uniformly excellent. However, this recording pales by comparison, mostly due to the singer, who sounds more like a robust folk singer than an opera/classical singer. I listened to this recording once, five or so years ago, and was so disappointed that I have let it collect dust in my collection. Highly disappointing."
3,The Sviridov is good,"Years ago, I bought this CD to have a CD version of the Stepan Razin performance. I have an old LP version I love. I was quite disappointed, in that I'm a great fan of the orchestral music and not a fan of singers. The singer dominated, the orchestra sounded weak in the background. I'm pretty sure this is more to do with the way the recording devices were positioned than the actual performance. I do feel glad to have this CD as an introduction to the music of Sviridov."
1,CRAPOLA,The slot for the receiver is NOT cut wide enough. NO way I could even install it on my Colt AR15. Pure BUNK!
3,Too big for my hands.,"Ok, it fit perfect on my MP 15, but my hands are average i guess. I have a kimber 45ACP single stack, and my hands fit it perfect. Had sum punisher grips on it and wanted to put this set up on my rifle. It fits perfect to the MP 15, but my hands are too small for it. Its more like a Double stack 1911 feel. I cant use it but it looks good just too wide for me. If you have banana hands then you will like this. Looks killer just not for me. I kinda felt like the Burger King commercials with those tiny hand LMAO. Thanx, I hope this helps."
3,yellow melo,i luv this toy its the greatest but its dumb that you dont have informaition on him i wanted to know his birthday.i think thats dumb even though i love this toy.
5,Better and Better,"Awesome CD. I tried to pick a favourite track, but everytime I listen to it I find a new one. There are no filler songs, I can listen to the entire cd straight through, and then turn around and listen again.Get this CD!"
4,Obnoxious Rock,"It took me a while, but I now love TFK. One day I was in a 'I have to buy a CD mood' (that happens when you get your first job and suddenly have money) and I'd heard good stuff about them... and they were one of the very few CDs in the Christian section at Walmart! (Of course then I looked at Zellers and it was cheaper :)) I put it on... I had an hours drive ahead of me... and I did a double take. It was much more my brothers style than mine. I never thought I was such a rockin' gal :) But I kept on trying them... and I acquired a taste for TFK's 'obnoxious rock' as they call it. I can't think of a better way to describe it. If you can't stand 'hard' music, don't try them, but you never know, you might be like me. Cause now I'm a big fan."
3,No Phenomenon... Just Hype,"If it wasn't for the $8 price tag I wouldn't have bought this cd because it's not crap, but it doesn't reach the highs that Set It Off did and I'm no longer a youngin with the capacity to enjoy some of the more bland tracks.I love GOOD rap and the first cd had some of that. There's rap on here, but no where near enough good stuff. Of course, musically, this cd is much improved though I'm not saying Set It Off was really lacking. Of course, the presence of good turntables would've helped their latest."
1,never recv'd,"I'm glad I received this email so I could respond. My original email from the purchase was lost during a computer crash. I never received the CD. I'm sorry it has taken this long, but I wasn't sure how to get ahold of you and I am unfamiliar with this type of situation. Please advise. Thank You."
2,blah,"for all its worth TFK dont sound like slacks in energy but there over slick and shallow Phenomenom doesnt really showcase anything except there clean cut.Everything sounds crisp but the material isnt there. over familiar riffage, corny spiritual lyrics, and the big chorus' that arent memorable enough to be as loud as they are. TFK the last of the rap-core to break main stream (sort of) they dont resemble a whole lot of idenity despite of how listenable the album is (harmony leaks in on ocassions). Some songs work with a bang wether it be the Title track with its massive chorus' the vibrant and punchy ""bounce"" and the even punchier ""rawkfist"". elsewhere the album plays ctahc up to that format. The lack variety and idenity kill the album and the rawk boy who raps should be left people like Zack Dela Rocha not these guys"
2,"Bought it, then dumped it - FOR GOOD!","Kept the sampler CD attached to this thing. Bought it from Zellers for $13.99. It was a bum-rush sorta thing then for some reason this CD, music, neither gel with me. Fancy artwork doesn't cut it. Doesn't bode well with me, both artistically and musically. Very frightening. I was on thin ice when I ditched it and I'm glad. I've read that they're taking a whole brand new musical direction on their next CD from this one. Sheeeeesh! When will they ever learn????? Not from my wallet, they won't."
5,A massive improvement,"I first heard TFK about a year ago, and was mildly impressed with their debut album. This album is a huge step up from their previous effort. I heard ""Bounce"" and ""Phenomenon"" a while back, and was instantly sold on this album. It rocks all the way from beginning to end. You won't regret picking this one up."
5,My Opinion,1 PHENOMENON 9.5/102 STEP TO ME 10/103 LAST WORDS 8/104 THIS IS A CALL 7.5/105 RAWKFIST 9/106 FAITH LOVE HAPPINESS 9.5/107 I CLIMB 9.5/108 QUICKEN 9.5/109 NEW DESIGN 8.5/1010 BOUNCE 9.5/1011 ORDINARY 10/1012 BREAK THE SILENCE 12/10AN AMAZING ALBUM! A must buy!
5,Review for TFK's 'Phenomenon',"I absolutely love this CD. TFK is my favorite band. I started listening to them when 'Set It Off' was out. That album was amazing. When Phenomenon came out, I was probably one of the first to buy it at our local Christian book store. Even though the styles are different, it's still TFK. I can listen to every song on both CD's. They are amazing! They are really good in concert also! I can't wait for their 'Set It Off' remix and remastered CD to come out on Sept. 7. I urge everyone who loves TFK to buy this CD."
5,"TFK, The best Christian Band Period!","Yea, you have your christian bands like Creed and Switchfoot and etc. But Thousand Foot Krutch is better than any of them by far. Though not yet main stream these guys should be.To be honest I never heard of these guys until my local radio station (96.5 The Buzz) played ""Rawkfist"" (which I thought at the time was Rockfist). The radio station played the song THREE TIMES IN A ROW!With the influence of Hip Hop and Hard Rock (and God) this band can appeal to either audience. And let's not forget they are a Christian band!!! Who would've thought a christian band could be so good?Overall, TFK is very creative and kind of refreshing with their new sound. I recommend this CD highly if your a rock fan or even a hip hop fan or BOTH! Enjoy folks! Rock on TFK!!!"
5,You have to get this CD,This cd is the best you will ever have. I will promise you that. I mostly listen to rock and Christian rock in the car while i drive to work. My friend would sing along to the songs. It was awesome. I got her listenin to christian music without even realizing it. If you love any kind of rock this is the cd for you promise you wont regret it.
1,This is what you would call rock?,"The fact that rfk is a christian band has nothing to do with what i think of them, i dont mind the lyrics either even though they lack creativity. The main problem here is the sound. These guys think they are so new age playing nu-metal and fusing rock with rap. In the end they dont have ne talent and theyre nothing more then posers acting all kool and rock n roll. The lyrics are uninspired, the guitar riffs and over all sound showcases nothing new or even remotely creative. In the end you would probably think kids would listen to this crap, yeah sure they wud with the way tfk sticks to a basic formulae that makes this music seriously bland. And how would i have listened to this album if i hate tfk so much, well a frend of mine likes it so i'v had the pleasure of enduring this crap quiet a few times!!!"
1,Oh My Heck Its 50 Cent the 2nd,"Well this band has a G funk rythmic tune to add to their mad funkadelic rhymes. When i heard this band i thought Black eyed Peas, 50 cent, eminem, and chingy all in one group and i was impressed that a labeled ""Rock Band"" could actually play Rap R&B and Hip Hop music i just never knew. Their music is almost comical in a sense. If you feel like a good laugh then listen to ""Rawkfist"" or the song ""Candystore"" Let me quote a line from one of their songs ""Put up your Rawkfist if your feelin it when i drop this"". So as you can tell they try to be rawk but they cant even spell it right. So dont believe any person who believes this rap band can compare to JIMMY EAT WORLD."
1,never received my order,"I never received my order thanks alot, os I finally give up and canceled my order. I will never order from you again...Laura Dougherty"
4,TFK Owns,"This new cd by TFK is really good. I'm so use to their first cd 'Set It Off', I was expecting the same sound with new tunes.TFK went into a harder and deeper sound with this new cd. If you are a fan and you have their first cd, but don't have this one. I would strongly suggest getting this cd, you will like it. You will appreciate their new sound. Its God's way of working in them and changing them."
5,Great Book!,"This is an exceptional book that uses words and images very effectively to tell the story of the Civil War. I've looked at other books on this, some of which are very good, but this is the best in terms of giving great detail without bogging the reader down in too much detail that only historians or war buffs would be interested in."
2,No video support for Kindle,"The book is probably great, but not all the features are Kindle friendly.Music and videos are advertised, but not enabled on Kindle."
3,The Civil War,When I purchased the paperback I did not realize that it would not have the photos which the hardcover contained so I was disappointed with my purchase.
3,Good book but written from the Northern perspective only,"This is a very well written book, but it is written strictly from the northern perspective, so you'll find information that is not correct."
3,"Well,,,at least the maps were nice.","A good basic,, strictly introductory account of the so called CIVIL war from a revisionary point of view. At least it did point out that lincoln USED the slavery issue to help win the war and NOT as a reason to fight it.Lots of pics of confederate dead,,only confederate dead?? no union dead,,why is that??Any way the maps are nice."
5,Funniest Man Ever R.I.P.,"I havent seen this new DVD, but I saw all 3 of those performers do the show's live. Robin Harris is hands down the funniest comedian ever. When he died, black comedy died as well. Damon Wayans was also very funny when he was younger. Mark Curry is corny, and I dont know how he made it on this DVD with the other 2 great performers. I would buy this DVD just for the ROBIN HARRIS portion."
2,Great book riddled with grammatical errors,"This was a great book, however there were so many grammatical errors and misspelled words. I normally don't write reviews on the books that I read but was very disappointed with the number of errors and misspelled words. This book definitely needs to be revised and corrected."
2,Didn't like it,"It took me 5 days on and off to get through this book. The storyline seemed promising, but I just couldn't get into it. Will and Josephine just had zero chemistry to me, which is a shocker coming from Ms. Byrd. There was also so many characters introduced throughout the book that it got frustrating keeping track of who was whom. There were a ton of grammatical errors which were really distracting. The author needs to read this book in full and fix all the errors. I know this book is a 2nd edition so that may explain why it doesn't pack as strong a punch as Ms. Byrd's newer books so I will definitely continue to support her efforts."
5,edits,"This book was really good, fast paced with a good plot from start to finish. My only complaint was the editing. There were many words in the wrong places sometimes more than three times on a page."
5,Whew!!,"This is the first book that I read by this author and definitely will not be the last. I read it in a day; it was that good. Mystery, suspense and romance...what more could you ask for? I'm hoping the author will write more about William and Josie."
4,A Real Page Turner!,"I really enjoyed this book. It was filled with suspense and intrigue, romance and passion - what more could you ask for? Oh yeah, a super hero, Dr. William Hayes, from Josephine's past really made this an enjoyable read! Keep up the good work!"
5,Love the story,"Enjoyed reading this book, its highly recommended, romance, suspence the lot, great characters."
4,ROMANCE AND SUSPENSE,"I have always been a huge fan of Ms. Byrd's Contemporary Romance, and thought they were excellent, but I think Ms. Byrd has found another calling in her two recently released books, IF YOU DARE and DEADLY DOUBLE. I couldn't put DEADLY DOUBLE down, this was certainly a page turner. Imagine if someone took over your identity.I can hardly wait for the next book in this series of Romantic Suspense.Great job Ms. Byrd!"
3,"Adrianne byrd is a good ,but this book didn't cut it","Adrianne byrd is a good writer don't me wrong, but this books whole plot wasn't like something you'd think she would write about."
4,Well Planned,"Roberts attacks this project to honor Porter and Cole with analytical skill, and succeeds in educating, if not thrilling the listener.The liner notes were among the best I have seen, as Roberts lays out his project, goals, and tactics on every song. Very informative.He also seems committed to letting the trio flex its muscles, so that we get a lot of variety in drumming styles, a lot of work for the bass, including duets and interesting solos.There is also care taken to blend the music, with interesting bookend versions of ""Answer Me, My Love,"" some great interludes, and the very good original bridge ""Cole After Midnight.""Structurally, this is a very sound album, leaving only personal taste to judge between a 3-star and 5-star effort. I come down in the middle."
2,Huge Letdown...,"If you're interested in what herbs to plant in Florida, when, where, and more...don't order this book! I've been growing herbs for about two years now and thought this would help me out. The book caught my eye when it listed that it is broken up by North, Central, and South. Wonderful....however, this is the letdown. The author DOES NOT talk about all of the herbs you can grow in these three areas. The author simply visited 3-4 local nurseries/herb farms and writes about what they grew in their location. Other than this, the book had the same information about herbs as most of them do. Don't waste your time! I wish I could tell you it was great...sorry!"
5,my wife absolutely loves it.,"I bought this book for my wife, who is into natural health remedies. She absolutely loves this book. She not only learned alot more about growing herbs, but harvesting them and what to do with them after she has them. She's happy I'm happy."
4,Great for Floridians,It's great for south Florida home herb growers especially since our climate and growing season is so different from most reference books.
3,Cary Nord's artwork in three dimensions,"Less of an action figure and more of a mini-statue. That's fine for me, but if you are looking to re-enact the classic battles from Robert Howard's classic tales, this really won't get the job done. Great detail. Matches Cary Nord's art from the current Conan comic.If you get only one Conan figure from the line, I recommend this one."
4,Recomended for wolf fans,"Like the first person said the actual toy is not like the picture.Instead of yellow eyes it has red, but I recomend this if your a fan of wolves and the company it was made by."
2,Dustless Drywall Pole Sander,Will made but hard to use on ceilings but great on walls. I needed for ceilings so I was disppointed with the sanding pole.
1,Broke two of them,"I purchased two of these. While it is a great idea, the head is plastic and breaks/cracks easily. Dust is greatly reduced and works good in that way. The head does not move easily like a pole sander with a metal head."
1,Arrived broken,"Didn't want to rate it 1 star! Company did nothing but try to put the blame on delivery service, however the product was broken."
5,Primate Gross Anatomy,"27 years after it was first published an ""Atlas of Primate Gross Anatomy"" remains the definitive text on catarrhine anatomy. The primary focus of the atlas is the regional anatomy of the baboon with comparative references to Pan and Man (Homo sapiens sapiens). All regions are covered with special emphasis placed on the limbs. The text is clearly written and well referenced by Dr. Swindler and beautifully illustrated in both carbon dust and pen and ink techniques by Charles Wood. This is a mandatory reference book for primate anatomists and veterinarians and is highly recommended for many specialty courses in primatology and human evolutionary anatomy."
4,Should be among the classics.,"This book should be among the classics, not the out of print. It's full of vulgar language and vulgar acts, but it is also raw and real. This novel is complex and poignant. And will have you thinking about a great many things once your able to put it down. I bought this book because I found out Robertson is one of Stephen King's favorites. It's easy to see the influence in style. I've ordered two more out of print Robertson novels and eagerly await their arrival. Robertson is a modern genius. I'm still trying to figure out why he's out of print. This guy should be read in the colleges of America. Robertson can outwrite Don DeLillo any day of the week. And I like DeLillo."
3,Excellent writing but terrible story line,"This author is superb as a writer but I give this book only 3 stars because of the story line. I felt betrayed by the ending. I thought I was reading a raw and honest account of a man sinking into grief for the loss of his wife, the loss of all he had held onto as sustaining memories of his son, who died in childhood, for the terror of seeing the end of his own life on the horizon and thus looking upon the phony assurances of those around him with a growing anger and emotional release, letting go of the normal social niceties of putting up with intolerable situations. However, as the book ended, I realized I was seeing a descent into madness and the guy ends up a mass murderer."
5,A very fine writer,"This collection of seventeen short stories is wonderful. Casey's style is dense and rich, and his plots are alive with hints and lurking presences that cast shadows across the surface of his stories. The Havana of his stories is lusciously and grittily real, but at the same time seen in such a way that there is a scary sensation of collapse and sliding away.If you are shopping for a Cuban O. Henry, however, seek elsewhere: Casey is not what your high school English teacher had in mind when he was expounding on the short story. And if you find ""Wired"" challenging your mind, pass Casey by."
3,A hidden star,"It's quite a tragedy that Casey never completed a novel before committing suicide. This collection of his works (some translated into English for the first time) is an amazing taste of his burgeoning style. Casey was a friend of Virgilio Piñera and Severo Sarduy, so I was eager to read these stories. He created tight worlds that convey much in their brevity. Stand-out stories for me include ""Homecoming"" (where a man returns to Cuba where he's arrested and tortured for unknown reasons), ""The Execution"" (similar to ""Homecoming"" where a man is arrested for a crime he didn't commit, and yet he never speaks a word in his defense), and ""Piazza Margana"" (which is a brilliant love story in the style of Piñera or Poppy Z. Brite). Some stories are difficult to fathom, and yet it's evident the potency Casey had in his writing, especially when writing about his Cuban heritage and his ambivalent sexuality."
4,Skifell,"This figure is sculpted in an outstanding action pose and the detail is spectacular. The only problem with the figure is his pose is almost impossible to maintain standing. Because he is preparing to strike, the figure's weight is not centered over his feet and the articulation isn't quite right to balance him. The base is far too small to support the figure's weight.Still, it is an excellent figure and perfect for expressing the Viking/Celt barbarian style and ferocity."
4,Music which makes you in a good mood,This is good music when you just want to relax and it will make you in a good mood
5,My all time favorite Christmas book,"If you love Madeleine L'Engle's books, then this is a definite ""must have"" for the holidays. Read about the Austin family as they prepare for Christmas, the church pageant, and a new addition to the family. Their warmth and love for each other are contagious, and yet they are a ""real"" family, growing pains and all. This is a fabulous book for young girls - and one to read every year in preparation for the holiday season."
3,Educational at best,"I gave this game a three star rating only because it might be good as an educational tool for middle age children or younger, but as a game it's really not much fun. Graphics are poor, sound is good, acting is OK, concept is not very engrossing and the child will soon get bored, I think. I thought with the name ""Wild World"" there would be more adventure and interaction but it turned out to be only questions and you giving answers based on information given or available.The information is really quite extensive but I don't know how much a child will retain from this program or even if it would be of any use to him or her. A good encyclopedia would probably be a better investment."
3,awerage book,"The authors have very elementary approach and through the most of the book that pays off, achieving clarity and simplicity. However, there are times(check the section on ""cookie"") when clarity has been lost because the approach has been too simplistic. In general the book is OK if that is your starting point, but note that there is no much reference available you need once you start to use it. In the situation when almost all computer tutorials are accompanied with the CD-rom, this book is not and that is one more handicap."
3,An OK introduction to JavaScript but you will need more.,"I am a fan of the 'Complete Idiots' books, having read several which I have found to be illuminating for a novice new to a subject, but I have to rate this book as not being quite up to the standard I have come to expect from the series. Not that its a bad book, but it left me with a lot of questions and some confusion. I have since done more reading on the subject and have had many of my confusions alleviated by other authors, both on paper and on-line. I hesitate to condemn it but would advise those who are looking for an introductory text on JavaScript to maybe take a good look around before committing to this book - especially those who have previously been impressed by other 'Complete Idiots' titles."
2,Not recomended.,"Besides being Out of date, this book is often hard to follow. It also has a few typos and errors wich add to the confusion. I would not reccomend this book to someone who wants to learn todays javascript."
1,A Waste of Money,"Not only is there not very much useful information in this book, but it also contains several HTML errors, which I found very irritating (why trust someone to teach me JavaScript when I know HTML better than he does?). There's a lot of theory here, but not much that can be used for creating fun, simple scripts. I found online resources to be much more helpful."
1,"It's a book for previous programmers, not non-programmers!","The book features shallow attempts at being humorous at the beginnings of chapters, but falls far short of being written for those without a programming background trying to get started in javascript. I resented its attempt to capitalize on the ""...for dummies"" books style to pass off dry and poorly written material!"
1,What a waste of money,You are NOT buying the whole series... just one dvd in the series for anywhere between 40 - 300 dollars! FOR A SINGLE DVD! Do not fall to this gimmic!
3,A missed opportunity,"Michael Gilchrist (see above) rightly says ""If Columbia was going to all this trouble, why not go for 100% instead of 90%?"" I have to add that there several mistakes in these otherwise highly recommended CDs. The takes of both ""The Good Earth"" and ""Summer Sequence, part IV"" marked as alternates (CD2, #17 & #22) are actually the ones originally issued, and vice versa (check the tenor sax solos to spot the difference). Furthermore, the two Bijou takes included (CD1, #7 and CD2, #18) are both alternates, and thus the classic Bill Harris solo has been left out this compilation."
3,Words fail me,The Bijou on tracks 7 and 18 is NOT the famous one originally issued on a 78- I still have it. They got it right on The Thundering Herds on CBS. Summer Sequence part 4 which is claimed to have been unissued I have on an LP bought in the 1950's. The unissued tracks on disc 2 are unbelievably bad and are irrelevant.
3,Not the bassist for Elvis Costello.,"The obvious comparisons to SLC Punk might be a product of both films showcasing themes that seem to be inexorable from the tales of any slacker youth. A coming of age moment where realizations occur regarding years or a parent's dry preaching, otherwise I see very little similarities. If anything the lead character, Kev, might have inspired Napoleon Dynamites slow, almost brain damaged responses and utter lack of social grace. Although Kev comes off as a less conceptualized, more coherant and perhaps authentic character. This film also features hort, but unique appearances from legendary Minneapolis punk rock bands Onward To Mayhem and The Subversives, who also appear opn the soundtrack and throughout the film. There are a few laugh out loud moments, a lot of clever repartee, and the metaphors serve as segues throughout the movie. ALlthough the closing is slightly confusing the movie leaves you with a sense of well-being."
3,Where's Untucked?,I would have purchased both season 2 and 3 about ten minutes ago until I found out Untucked wash't on the discs-- whats the purpose?
5,LOVE ME SUM RUPAUL,"I LOVE THE DVD, JUST TOOK THEM TO LONG TO SEND IT..... I WONDER WHY THEY DON'T HAVE SEASON 1"
3,What's the Point Without UNTUCKED?,"Watching RPDR without Untucked? Don't bother. Or did RPDR keep Untucked from the collection because it shows how nasty DJ Pierce (Shangela), Alexis and others were?"
5,African music with Bela Fleck,"This is a great DVD - better than the album. It shows African music at its best. Unlike Paul Simon's Graceland, this is not African musicians sitting in with Paul Simon. This is authentic African music - with Bela Fleck adapting to the African music rather than vice versa. It's very well shot."
5,WOW,this is a great movie and it is cool to watch another cultures music in the makeing and to see how an american deals with it
5,Bela Fleck is incredible,"I feel that this documentary has opened my mind to great new styles of music. If you are a fan of other Bela Fleck projects, African music, or any music in its purest organic form, buy this. Thanks Bela."
5,Mesmerizing,"Jamaica Kincaid's writing talents had propelled her to staff writer at ""The New Yorker"" for years and then to teaching creative writing at Harvard. I have loved all of her books that I've read. ""Mr. Potter"" seems like a departure from her usual style with its mosaic of words, stream-of-consciousness, repetitiveness. Normally, I don't appreciate that type of writing but this I found to be mesmerizing. Not always entertaining but poetic and brilliant. I loved it. I have so much respect for this woman as a writer."
1,Dire,"Kincaid's distinctive style feels flat in this book. The repetitions and revisitings are laboured and the feeling lingers that one is reading a submission from a freshman creative writing program, rather than a work from a talented writer (as her excellent essays reveal her to be). Too often the chance of achieving real affect is lost in favour of maintain the forced technicality of the writing. The attempt to capture a character who exists predominantly in absence is certainly interesting, but this is an unsuccessful novel and often painfully badly written."
4,"IF YOU LIKE MYSTERIES, GET THIS BOOK!","I like mysteries,and I couldn't find any. I tried this book and it is great! I think it was just the right book for me. It is very funny, and I think you will enjoy it."
4,Hmmmmm..........,"I'm not sure if they meant for this cd to be a new Styles P. cd or a mixtape. The sound at times, sounds like a thrown together mixtape. Either way it's a great new disc that shows off Styles P's talent. And it features some great legends in the mix, such as Kool G. Rap, AZ, Cormega, and soon to be underground legend, Ill Bill. ""F*ck The Police"", ""No Remorse"", ""Pain"", ""The Stuggle"", and ""Use Mad Clips"" featuring Cormega are some of the albums highlights, and definatly make this cd worth owning."
2,Substantial deviation from Wodehouse,"Increasingly Deus ex machina solutions nowhere to be found in Wodehouse. The women become even more scheming than in season 3. More slapstick random running about. A giant machine pumps sewage from the manor house all over the bride and groom and wedding guests at the end, causing them to chase Wooster and Jeeves around the church. So funny. Episodes resolve the plot twists with 1) a lightning strike and 2) jumping overboard. It is as though the writers just gave up at some point."
1,Not what was displayed or ordered,"This item was not what I ordered nor what was displayed, and I returned it twice - they paid the postage. Fortunately, Amazon refunded my purchase price promptly. I do not know whether Amazon has fixed the product page to reflect the correct item."
4,needs shoes,"Don't pay more than $5 for this toy, that's all it's worth. Pretty pathetic it doesn't even come with some kind of sandals or shoes..."
5,A real rarity,"Very interesting and rare recordings of the last castrato, even if his voice was at that time already rather exhausted. The most fascinating thing is to hear from living the voice of a Pope of the XIXth Century as Leo XIII was."
2,This Phenomenon Best Taken in Small Doses,"Seriously, I would be surprised at the ***** reviews if I didn't recognize that those reviewers have an operatic history expertise that gives them a tolerance for long listening to this CD which I'm unable to muster. Should I be embarrassed to admit that I can't listen to it--song-by-song, throughout--without several breaks to unclench my teeth?I wasn't looking for contemporary recording quality, and I didn't expect a Joan Sutherland experience (nor even a Jackie Evancho one!). I am prepared to tolerate the florid castrati style that seems overdone today. But I can't play it for very long without a breather. I don't regret buying it because it is, after all, the only extant recording of the phenomenon that Moreschi represents. I find him best taken in small doses, however."
3,Historical Value Only,"Sorry...I'm blunt...so here goes. It's one of histories greatest ironic tragedies that someone would be castrated in order to be a castrati, and then end up having no talent. It's like a midget having a dream of playing in the NBA, or a one-legged man dead set on being a tap dancer."
4,My search for the perfect Laksa,"Two years ago I had the perfect Laksa in tiny restaurant in Chatswood, Australia. Since that time I've been trying to re-create that meal at home. After numerous tries, I've come to realize that I never will, but with Por Kwan Laksa paste, I can make an enjoyable meal."
1,taste so different from the Laksa taste,"Taste kind of sour, somehow i think it is too old, so the taste has changed a bit. I won't recommend people buying from this site"
3,If you like Darrin watch this,You need to know alot about Bewitched <Meaning you know the characters> to watch this. Also you need to PAY ATENTION!
1,horrible,"Undoubtedly, this book is the most horrible piece of published literature that I have ever encountered. I checked it out from my local public library, and I regret that I didn't thumb through it a bit more prior to checking it out. There is very little logical coherence, and the author absolutely slaughters some of the most basic rules of English grammar. The editor should feel ashamed for letting such a monstrosity approvingly pass over his/her desk, and anything else produced by the publisher should be called into question. If this book had been composed by a talented author, it might have been interesting."
4,The Day Elvis came to Town,"A great story of a young girl that lives in a hotel with her parents, until one day a different person comes to town. A lady that has a singing career and has been all across the country. They form a special friendship, both sharing a love for Elvis."
3,Wolves don't have teeth,This movies is Ok but not up to the level that you would expect from the other reviews
5,Great look,"This is a nice versatile pull, color is great and the quality is very nice especially for the price! Using in my kitchen."
3,cute story,"I felt that this story began slowly and then started to get interesting, only to end on a boring note. There was lots of daydreaming between the two main characters, but not enough conversation. Marty talked more ""about"" Will than ""with"" Will. I also think that the story ended too abruptly. The ending was building and building, and then all of a sudden it just stopped!! Overall, though, this was a cute, light, and easy read."
2,disappointed,"the concept of comparing football to marriage is great, but the writing is lacking. The suggestions are neither great nor profound. There are better books on this subject."
4,Excellent watch,"I just received my watch from watchzone (great seller). From US to Romania, the shipping took only 3 days with UPS saver. The watch is great, but the pictures at amazon make it look somewhat slimmer than it really is."
3,Be Careful,The watch seems good but I'm returning it because it didn't look quite like it does in the picture. I thought it'd be gold with a dark brown strap but it turns out to be copper colored with a reddish brown strap. Just making sure people know
4,Rating for performance,"Unfortunately I haven't heard this release, but another reviewer suggests that its sonics may be inferior to the Webster releases. I have the Webster release -- in fact I've had two of them -- and the CDs somehow decay over time. The first set did and they readily replaced it; but then the second set also developed skips and other problems that stopped play dead. I have great admiration for the work that Webster and associates do, and for their commitment to providing the best reproduction for classic recordings. But it doesn't matter if they don't last. I've never had a recording from a known label decay (except a Porgy and Bess from EMI), so I have to wonder if it's better to buy an edition like this one."
1,"Sad, sad, sad","this is really sad that people would purchase a video which shows you how to dance hip hop. people, dance comes from the soul and no matter how hard you practice this, if you are a bad dancer you'll still look [bad]. sorry but its the truth"
5,Hip Hop Shop Review,"This DVD is great to watch if you want to learn some of the hip hop dance moves! It was fun to watch it with my friends, and try the moves together. You might have to watch it a few times to real get the moves down. My little brother liked it to. He is always hip hopping around the house."
3,Hip Hop Shop,"Not as professional as off da hook, I perfer watching off da hook, I'm not sure about the kids preference. But it didn't cost as much so I guess you get what you pay for"
3,I hate it,it has nothing to do with hip hop. they should put pop culture shop. It has nothing related to hip hop.
1,I never received the video!,I read the statement: Will send in two to three business days. It's been almost one month. I never received the video. I'm not happy!
3,Confusing,I'm 11 years old and I thought that it was hard to see the moves that they were doing. It was like looking in a mirror. I get confused with what leg to move and where to move it. Great moves though.
2,Only For Younger Kids,"I am 12 years old and I thought this video was better for younger kids. It is kind of hard to do the moves. They show you about 12 moves and then you can put them together at the end to make up a routine, but they don't teach you full dances.It is truly a hip hop type video."
3,They Look Great,"They would have been perfect for me. But the quality was bad. Within 2 weeks of ordinary inside wear, it began showing serious signs of wear. Too bad because I liked them, and they fit great."
2,The recorded cello:,"For the right person this may be a treasure. However I was looking for some cello music for my wife and did not realize this was composed of actual recordings from records complete with very scratchy background like a 1940's victrola. I did not see the listen option when I ordered ""The Recorded Cello"" The merchant requests that I pay the return shipping which I think is a fair request."
4,Paper-Thin/ Soul-Deep,"These letters and journal entries ritten by men of color, in the simplist form, offer us the hope we need to tell our own stories. Stories of failure and success, of love kept and love loss. It show the diversity that exist among men of color, while rejection the myth that we are unable to express ourselves.Blanchard, Shelton, Mims-Goodman and Company should be praised for this gathering of Black men that have spoken so profoundly through the written word on the lives of ordinary Black men. They take us from the hood to academia, to struggles with our sexuality, to the prison world, to our relationships with others, even our grandmothers.Using several different styles of writing, from first person to narrative, comedy and tradegy, Paper-Thin Soul-Deep is a must read!"
3,G ELITE,G-Elite Designer Brand style Fashion Bangle Watch BN-5006- LOOKS VERY NICE - BATTERY DONT LAST LONG
5,LONG TIME PONTY FAN,This is a must album for true Ponty fans. It captures his timeless song writing ability. I'm glad I added this album to my collection. I listened to it while driving for a few months before I decided to change the CD. Great album!
4,not like 70's jlp but very good,The Acatama Experience is a very good cd but not like jlp's music of the 70's. With his same line up since 91 and special guitar guest from Alan Holdworth and Philip Catherine. This cd has alot of excellent musical moments. I would say his best cd since Storytelling (1989).
5,just a guideline,"I like so much the music of Ponty, specially this record, but a need to clarify that the chilean desert is named ATACAMA, not ACATAMA.RegardsMy name is Luis Orellana, and obviously i'm from Chile.(pd. sorry for my english)"
3,Acatama,"I didn't like it as well as some of his older work (i.e. ""Mystical Adventures""), but it's nice to still hear him make music."
4,A lot of bang for your buck,"I bought this mp3 for my sister and she loves it. I used it for over a month before I gave it to her for her bday gift, I had to be sure I got her something worthwile.Pros:Can pick from several colorsRechargeable battery through usbunder $80Can also record notes with built in microphoneCan also listen to fm radio (with in the city)Its as easy as drag and dropBattery lasts close to 18 hoursIts also very easy to use and navigate through menusNoise quality is really goodCons:Its only 256 MB, but that allows for close to 60 songs. But Its easy to add and delete songsHas no hold buttonThe earbuds are not comfortableThe case is not an arm bandOverall, the pros outweight the cons, its a good buy as long as you don't plan to carry your entire music collection with everwhere. Come on, do you really need to carry 2500 + songs everywhere?"
2,sorry it didn't work,"I know it's a Canadian best seller, and I want to support our writers - there are some of great merit, but this book just didn't do it for me. The style was okay, and the story line imaginative, but it never quite got there. I assume it was headed for a story of romantic characters with depth, but Ms. Urquhart just never got them there. Changing Heaven - I doubt it. But if you have nothing else to read, you could kill an afternoon with it and not feel too bad about wasting the day relaxing with a book."
1,don't bother,"If you are someone like me and has enjoyed other NASA series like ""When we left the Earth"" or ""From the Earth to the Moon"" then don't bother with this series. This is nowhere near the quality of those films. This is all old footage that is graining not in wide screen or HD and cheaply done. Seriously bad buy even for ten bucks."
1,Web Interface written by Monkey,"Thank any god you like that Cisco eventually purchased Linksys. Linksys knows how to create a usuable interface. Cisco makes quality hardware... Marry the two and you should get a really great kid... the 871W is a solid WAP with some truly nice features... that's impossible to configure unless you have a freaking degree in Cisco. A drunk, blind, retarded monkey could have written a better Web interface for configuring the wireless side of things. I've never used such a worthless interface in my life. Pull out your console cable and save yourself the hassle."
4,Chicago Cutlery Metropolitan 9-Inch Bread Knife,"seems like a really excellent knife, cuts bread quite well. Gooad quality at a good price."
5,Chicago Cutlery Bread Knife,"This knife is great. I had an old bread knife. Was trying to slice some Italian bread, and it wasn't cutting it. This knife arrived after I had to cut up the Italian bread, and it sliced like a dream. Will probably slice our tomatoes next season wonderfully. Very pleased with this knife and especially the price."
5,Great knife,"I own a number of different brands of knives from German to Japanese.I find this knife to be a real bargin. Great value. You get a wonderful bread knife that slices well,is not heavy,stays sharp and does not cost an arm and a leg.You cant ask for much more. A great knife to help complete your set."
5,wicked awsome,"granted, it took a minute or so to get it to fit on its stand, (thank you production company) but once it was on, it looked outstanding! fantastic member of our new collection."
4,"Great, but slightly disappointing","I bought this CD for the Bloch Suite Modale. Ironically, it's the piece I like least. Alexa Still plays impeccably, with wonderful tone and other excellent technique. But the Bloch plods a bit. It needed more energy and more exuberance. So buy this CD for all the other pieces, and find a diferent recording of Suite Modale."
4,this book is pretty good,"this book was pretty good. it looks like something you could make at home, but the infromation inside is valuable. in one part of the book, though, theres mistakes where the notes on the neck are being labeled."
2,Comic book approach; accuracy question?,"I am a beginner, and I was attracted by this book's title.It is laid out in an easy-to-read fashion, almost like a comic, and simple language is used to explain the exercises and the small amount of music theory that is included.One issue I have, is that in my copy, 1998, second printing, the ""Notes on the Neck"" section includes a number (10 or so out of 44) mislabeled notes. I was puzzled for a while, but I've checked other books, which are consitent with each other, and with note progression. So beware.Also, this is Vol.1: are there others?"
5,Easy To Use,"I bought this to wrap the pipes around my exterior water tank. The pipes froze once, and I never want that to happen again! I applied this in the fall and it took me through the entire winter - with several hard freezes - and the pipes came through fine. Since the pipes have several joints, and the connections for the pump motor and other things, this was ideal for working around all of the various nooks and crannies and curves and turns. The plastic cover protects it from the weather, which was exactly what I hoped it would do."
3,3-by-25 feet is a misleading title,"I can't say if this is the best fiberglass, or 5-star fiberglass. But read the whole description of the product before ordering.I incorrectly assumed that 3-by-25 feet meant 3 feet by 25 feet. Hilarious mistake, when I opened the box I felt like a giant. I will use this tiny, $5 piece of fiberglass to insulate my daughters dollhouse. Even then, it's kind of small."
3,Beware of annoying hum,"I assume this model does the job it is intended to do, but when I hooked it up to my desktop computer and peripherals, I found it also emits a hum that is annoying (to me, at any rate) and is louder than the fan noise from my computer. I was informed by a company rep that this hum is normal. It's unacceptable to me, so I returned the unit."
5,An excellent power conditioner/voltage stabilizer.,"This is an excellent power conditioner and voltage stabilizer,all in one.This unit can protect your sensitive high end audio system,computers,and video moniters,from....Everyday,power surges,power sags,over voltages,and brown-outs.These surges, pick away at your sensitive equipment..taking years off their useful life...i own and highly recommend,this unit,"
2,In Reference To Hum Complaint,"This unit only weighs 10 pounds shipping, and is very small physically. It is way too small and cheap for the supposed rating. I have an old power line conditioner which is little more than an isolation transformer, no AVR. It is rated 750 watts. But it weighs about 25 pounds and is at least half again as big as this Tripp Lite, and it does not make a sound. I run my whole work bench off it. This Tipp Lite is probably way over rated and under built. And that is why it hums. When it comes to transformers, yes, size DOES matter."
5,good,"very good, very good, is made &#8203;&#8203;of a material and is excellent can be used for any occasion, I received it in good time"
4,A good book for aviculturists interested in Eclectus.,"If you are looking for a book on keeping Eclectus parrots as pets, you will probably find this book disappointing, although it does contain limited information on the subject. (Unfortunately, no book has been written that includes extensive information on Eclectus as pets.) However if you are interested in the natural history of Eclectus parrots or in breeding Eclectus, this book should be part of your library. The chapter on natural and avicultural history is especially strong and brings some sense to the confusing topic of Eclectus subspecies."
2,Not a lot of information for the price,"The book provides some good and useful information about Eclectus Parrots but not enough to justify the price of the book. It is not a big book at all. The book does not go into much detail about things. For example, the author mentions the importance of having the right size and type of perch but never really says what that is specifically. How big around should the perch be? He doesn't say. If money is no big deal then this is a good book to add to your collection of books about Eclectus parrots.If you are interested in becoming an Eclectus breeder this book might be worth while. Breeding seems to be the main focus of the book.For dealing with parrot training and parrot problems and such I recommend ""Guide to a Well-Behaved Parrot"" by Mattie Sue Athan. There are some things I don't agree with in the book like her recommendation not to carry your bird around on your shoulder but there is a lot of good stuff in the book."
2,Not a good reference book,"THis book is more useful for its' pictures than it is for the information on dealing with an electus parrot. It does not go into detail about any of the topics that it should cover. It gives you more information on the history and anatomy of the parrot, than it does on this parrot's behavior. Nor does the book provide any training techniques or answers to behavior problems. I think you would be better off buying a general parrot training and behavior book, than buying this guide to the eclectus."
2,Disappointed with such great potential,"JVC boasts seven disks, however you can only randomize/program one audio disk at a time. Seems to me a watse of feature ability. Also great sound but one annoying and fatal complaint. When zooming to 2x in order to enlarge dvd movie image on standard TV, image is very acceptable however, very large zoom icon remains in upper left hand corner while you are viewing in this mode. You can not remove it according to JVC tech advisors since it was programed not to disappear. It is a shame since this ruins your viewing experience with an otherwise great feature packed product. Had to return due to that reason alone."
2,Random play?,"One word of caution for anyone wanting to randomize audio cds with this player. I bought this model and loaded it with six cds. After hearing multiple songs (in random order) from the same cd I started with, I checked the manual. The manual states in a small note at the bottom of the page that explains the random function that random only works on the currently selected cd. What good does a seven disc changer do you if you can't randomize the whole set? It seems like a really strange choice for JVC to make."
4,Nifty player for non stop movie action,"I love this dvd player, 7 disc changer! let me repeat, SEVEN disc changer. That means you can stick in 7 dvds, surround yourself with popcorn, snacks, etc. and watch until your eyeballs literally melt out from their sockets days later!!! The JVC player rocks, it features progressive scan to allow full range real time picture adjustment, and allows you to play mp3s, homemade vcds, and regular cds. The progressive scan allows effortless changing of disc without skipping. There are inputs, both in the front and rear of the unit for all the standard wires like rca in/out, digital in/out, and surround sound digital cable. the carosel slides out of the unit effortlessly, and without any noise."
4,"Clem, the Story of a Raven","If you love true stories about wild animals, you'll love this book. This story is the true telling by Owings Dewey about a baby raven that she and her husband rescued and then raised. She relates all the endearing antics of Clem in a way that educates, entertains and ultimately makes you fall in love with this intelligent, sometimes comical little bird. The book highlights the relationship the author has with Clem, and the relationship that develops between the author's newborn daughter and Clem as they both grow over the course of a couple of years. The author also shows how her relationship with Clem had to change inorder to ensure his survival. The ending of the story is bittersweet and powerful. The book made me wish I had known Clem personally, I can't seem to get him off my mind."
4,It's all right to be ittle bitty...,"This sushi press is so much smaller than I imagined. Granted, I don't eat a ton of sushi, but it looks like it'll press 5 1.5"" x3/4"" x 3/4"" little rice cakes- the perfect mouthful.All the same, it's very user friendly with good graphics on the back for those that don't read Japanese. I also like that the front reads, ""We do a living wealthily happily."" It makes me smile."
5,Best product,Excellent product!!! my experience is wonderfull! is a very good complement for sushezzy. no more restaurant for eat sushi an nigiris
5,Sooo much easier!,"I'm new to sushi making and trying to mold the rice by hand was taking forever and they kept falling apart or were too big. With this little tool I make perfect, firm rectangles of rice. Just line it with plastic wrap and they pop out easily!"
5,Great book,Easy to read and understand. It gives a comprehensive story of the Kennedy Space Center as well as the various missions NASA has undertaken. I understand now the different types of rockets and the history leading up to the Apollo 11 successful moon walk. This book was a page-turner. I could not put it down and read it all in one weekend.
1,Description is wrong.,I specically ordered this knife because it was supposed to have a wooden handle...it doesn't. The handle is bakelite. I wouldnt recommend this knife to anyone. There are better knives available for around the same price.
4,Fast delivery,"My only concern is that it had a different number than what it advertised. I ordered this as an extra part so we'll see if it works during crisis. You really couldn't beat the cost. This item was about $2.50 and when we bought the same item at a nearby store we were gauged, They charged almost $20 for the same item! I bought this in case the first one we bought ever burned out. If this fuse works it was a good investment and those 4 stars would turn into 5 stars."
2,Broke In less than a week,I installed this item on monday. Its not working on saturday. This item worked less than a week. The item came in fast though.
5,Excellent product,Paid 75 bucks last time for a service call to replace a fuse. This time I spent under 4 bucks and 20 mins later I had my dryer back up.
1,Misleading product name,The product description said it was by Whirlpool. What I received was in a plain plastic bag with no brand name markings. Clearly this is not a Whirlpool switch or the FSP brand which is also made by Whirlpool. I don't know if the switch will open when it is supposed to. I plan on returning the product to the seller.
1,thermofuse delays,"Part worked but came in a separate mailing even though it was ordered with two other dryer parts. The first one was ""delayed"" and after several inquiries they mailed a second one. Later found out the first one was mailed after we had received the second one.....very poor service from this company."
5,"Did the job, my dryer was working less than an hour after this arrived!","Great price, I even ordered a spare in case I burned one out. Exact replacement dropped right in. If your gas dryer stops heating check this first."
5,Fuse,The item was exactly what I needed and at a very reasonable cost! I was able to install it with ease!
3,Direct Replacement,"Fits like a glove and appears to be working. But, since I cannot verify that it correctly breaks at the correct thermal temperature (Or choose not too since that breaks it) I can't give it any higher star (I'm tough)."
4,"BOC's first effort, remastered at last!!","I've been a fan of BOC since I was a teenager, playing it LOUD trying to figure out those lyrics!! Unfortunately, the sound quality on this record (actually the first 2 albums) was really bad, in fact, remarkably bad. Well, now we have the remastered version, and it's worth having just for the clarity of sound! Plus the lyrics are printed in the liner notes, so you know what the words are, even if they still make no sense!! (""She tasted just like a fallen arch"" indeed!). BOC has GREAT guitar playing, and great songs. Especially the first 3 albums. Overall, I rate the 1st one between the essential ""Secret Treaties"" and the solid ""Tyranny and Mutation"". Pick This One Up!"
4,Tight Debut,"Blue Oyster Cult's first album rocked. The band did not need a couple of albums to find their way, their trademark heavy sound and occult lyrics were present from the start. ""Cities on Flame"" is a BOC standard, but there are plenty of other good songs on this album, ""Transmaniacon MC"" and ""Stairway to the Stars"" being two of the best. Even from the start, Don Roeser inserted a nice ballad on each album, and ""Then Came The Last Days of May"" is one of his best, evocative storytelling (apparently based on something that really happened to him). ""She's As Beautiful As A Foot"" and ""Redeemed"" are whimsical fun, nice soft spots among the guitar onslaughts. The remastered reissue vastly improves the sound quality. The extra tracks don't add much to what was already a great recording, but they are interesting nonetheless."
5,"One Of The Best, Just Got Better!!","This is another fine BOC remaster. Once again ,we see that this album was actually a better recording than the original masterindicated. Today's mastering technology pulled some of the ""little bits"", especially some fine piano from Allen Lanier out of the dark, reverby murk. The bonuses are a treat. At first I just thought they would be the same versions that were on Rhino's Stalk Forrest Group - ""St. Ceceilia"" CD, but thet are not ! These are from the Soft White Underbelly '69 sessions thought long lost. They are very raw, interesting demos. The rock n'roll classic ""Betty Lou's Got A New Pair Of Shoes"" is also very raw and fun to hear. Even if you have the original CD,you should pick this up as a true BOC fan."
5,GREAT!,"Another great one from the 50's! Hollywood, listen up and give the public something to look at that won't corrupt their mind's! You may even like it yourselves."
5,This series humor holds up well indeed!,"When I saw Topper as a kid it was a years-old sitcom running in the evening or as daytime filler. I loved the show and when I bought this DVD I felt it would be one of many that I watch and then resell on Amazon. But after watching it now for the second time in several years...it'll stay on my shelf. What gets me as a performer is the fact that this is a case where you have topnotch writing, great casting, wonderful timing and performing. True, the special effects are circa 1950s but the script and performances are so good that it truly does not matter. I had quite a few laugh out moments on this one. I like this far better than the old Topper movies. Quality? It's from old films. But if you love comedy, literal sitcoms, and truly great TV comedy performances you will want Topper. I was impressed with how well this show held up. This is one I won't be putting up for sale or donating to a library."
5,Booming Speakers!!,"Very good speakers, come with a warranty and Alpine is always a trustworthy brand in speakers. They were easy to install and sound great! Couldnt have bought a better set at a better price."
3,Good but could be better,"I think that someone should cross shrip with grapes. Then you could have shrimp on a vine... BUT.. every 5th ""grape/shimp is filled with cocktail sauce. And then you culd pick a bunch of grape/shrimp and slam them on the plate and BOOM! you would have perfectly cocktail sauced shrimp any time you want!!! If this shrimp was like that i would give it 6 stars!"
3,"Good romance, bad mystery = a mixed result","Ms. Boyle's style is a big stumbling block on this book; there are some very tortured phrasings, including some that simply do not make sense. The book is sometimes slow and the murder mystery is solved almost too quickly. That subplot is the least fulfilling part of the book. Indeed, the whole murder-ruby angle detracts from the lovely romance.There's some very nice humor; Rafe is a good hero; and the heroine is quite likable except for her desire to hang onto stolen property as though she deserves it. Perhaps it's supposed to be symbolic of the corrupting influence of the gem (the curse), but it doesn't really work. Nevertheless, Rafe and Rebecca are very good together. The romance part of the book is quite good, and is marred only by the subplot and by Boyle's overblown prose."
2,An absolute Oddity!,"If someone had told me that the first half and second half of this book had been written by different people I would have to believe them.The first half: Had me totally spellbound, I thought it had the makings of a fantastic romantic comedy romp. 5 StarsThe second half: To say it went ""off"" is a massive understatement. It was a muddled, confusing mess. Some of it seemed amateurish and ludicrous. 1 starI have read A LOT of regency romances and I've never experienced a book quite like this one. A terrible terrible waste of what could have been an amazing novel."
4,Good purchase,Perfect match for a replacement door bottom. Only problem was finding the right tools; women do not always have the ones that are needed.
3,A great destroyer of the steriotype of the cowering Jew,"This book is a great introduction into an overlooked topic. Far too often, Jews and Gentiles alike are ignorant or choose to ignore the history of Jews as people willing to defend itself.Unfortunately, this book sparsely documented and is rather jingoistic. This is not an academic work, but one meant for mass consumption.Finally, certain subjects have inaccuracies. The section on the Khazars, for instance, is based on outdated research. The authors would have done well to read DM Dunlop's research.I hope that this book is reprinted so that more people can read it. I also hope that someone does more serious academic work on this forgotten subject."
4,very useful book,"This is an incredibly detailed book, especially in terms of the nutritional needs of horses. The nutrient and ration tables in the back have been invaluable for tailoring diets specific to my horses' needs. My only complaint is that the second edition was published in 1996 and it is getting a bit dated. There is no discussion of the newer ""nutraceutical"" supplements on the market these days, or new research into topics already covered. I am hoping for a third edition, but I suspect I shouldn't hold my breath."
4,A very interesting book for horse caretakers,I think this book should be read by everyone who has to work with horses. Rich of useful notions on nearly every aspect of horsecare.
5,A really amazing novel...,Dar es Salaam is one of those novels that captures a young woman's soul. Tara Kai takes the reader into a world filled with questions and thoughts of a girl named Tatum. Her experiences and feelings for the characters in the novel help one understand a young woman's mind and ideas. I believe every girl and woman can relate to any of the women in this story. The novel has an original voice and it truly stands out on its own. Tara expresses the events and ideas in the book beautifully (and let me say... GREAT ending!) A very lovely book and a very gifted author.
4,"Blank or filled in by you and your friend, an excellent gift","This book is a wonderful gift for your best girlfriend at any age! My girlfriend of 15 years gave me this book as a gift two months ago, and she and I are still having fun collecting old pictures and recalling fond memories of our friendship. I love it!"
3,It's Just OK,"John Boyd is one of the most underappreciated military thinkers in history. Of the last half-century, it's probably also fair to say that he was one of the only strategic thinkers of any position of power in the United States.When it comes to this book, there are two problems. 1) Boyd didn't do himself justice. He hardly wrote anything down, he shunned attention and was highly combative. 2) Hammond hardly does Boyd justice either. This book is dry, dull and uninspired.I'm sure the first problem exacerbated the second but there is no excuse for a lifeless book on such fascinating subject. There is no comparison between Mind of War and Robert Coram's ""Boyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War.""In short, skip this book unless you're using it as a supplement for Coram's biography or for research purposes. If you're considering learning about Boyd for the first time, this is not the place to start."
2,Not quite what I needed,"I was hoping for a better description of Boyd's ideas and less time spent on his life. This guy revolutionized some major fields, but the book doesn't really tell me the guts of the concepts. Disappointing."
2,Poor sound,"This version was remastered form Everst, however the sound was very poor. You can not identify it was recorded at 1970s. The Penguin Guide gave rosset to Everst version, but you can not find the reason from this version."
5,Great basic SOHO switch,I've used a lot of Allied Telesys products over the years and this doesn't disappoint. Everything you want in a SOHO Gigabit switch.
3,Finished projects are rough and utilitarian-looking,"If you're a beginning woodworker looking for ideas, this book will be helpful. The instructions are detailed and clear, there are ample photos illustrating the construction, and complete cutting lists are provided.There are some projects here that give you good woodworking experience. Unfortunately, the finished products are rough-looking and utilitarian. There's nothing in here that you would be proud to show off.Some of the projects could be cleaned up by adding some finishing techniques such as routing edges on the wood and adding more curves to your cuts. If you have an eye for design, this book will give you the technical know-how to put together outdoor furniture. But if you follow the plans step-by-step, you'll have a backyard full of furniture that looks like it was made by the local troop of Cub Scouts."
3,The acoustic set deserves 5 stars,"The greatest Long Road ever recorded. Brilliant. The acoustic set on the first disc is a must have. Unfortunately the real concert is a little dissapointed. Eddie got some problems with his voice. I suppose the concert is too long. 3 stars will do.Despite off the great setlist. Try JB3, PH1, Seattle 2 or St. Louis instead."
4,First time buyer,"Being a first time Amazon buyer, I wasn't sure what to expect in service or product, the service was first rate and the product was what I had ordered.I will us Amazon again without hesitation.Bob, Fremont CA"
4,yummy! :D,"This CD has definitely turned me into a house fan. the tracks mix together so well, its candy to the ears :D I've been listening to it for a week straight, no joke. Its worth the time, money, and energy to buy."
2,MTV weak mix,"This CD was horrible. I'm not going to even take the time to write out a long review of why. Vission scored big with his tag-team mixes along side veteran train mixer Bad Boy Bill, but he just doesn't do it by himself.All through the mix he tries to hype it up with weak samples edited in studio time, however they just seem to accent the fact that he never establishes a solid groove.Warranted there are a few tracks amongst the junk, but if I want to play a CD for one song I'll buy the newest Britany Spears album (god forbid).For good solid house grooves - look elsewhere."
1,Oh No!,Sorry but I remember on my way back from the mall I wanted to shoot myself in the friggin leg for buying this cd! Had it since it came out and still have not listened to the whole thing. It may have been a better cd if it was put together properly. Do yourlself a favor and pass it up if youre looking!
3,blah blah blah,"bill, vission, icey and irene, the more you hear them all together the more you have a hard time telling them apart.In this latest installment, vission starts weak with remixes of the same old same old from the Bad Boy Bill ~ Bangin' Series and the House Connection series. In the end he dabbles shortly in his own style. Unfortunately, the first couple of times I listened to the CD, I didn't make it that far through. If this is your first attempt at a Vission CD, then you will probably enjoy it, but for us seasoned veterans, spend your money elsewhere."
3,Only average,"I was pretty excited to see RHV having a new CD out. Although his last CD ""Shut the f**k up and Dance"" was ""mixed"" together with neck-breaking speed, it still managed to get me pretty pumped up.His new effort is good, however it doesn't have the energy that his last CDs have had. It tries, but I think the music selection is lacking in most aspects. This isn't to say I didn't enjoy it, because I did. However I was looking for something with a little more kick. I am also disappointed to see him depart from the hard crunching Chicago style of house and trade it in for more of a trance flavor.Maybe next time. :) DamnDJ"
3,Its OK,It worked but is not holding up liked I hoped. For the price it still is a good bargin and is worth it for the money
4,Works well but adhesive needs help,After I installed this I noticed a huge temperature change in the foyer. It was at least 15 degrees warmer. I had a huge gap around my front door and this width and height were perfect. It has been about a month now and the sticky has unstuck on certain areas of the door. It still works well but not that pretty. I think I will put some staples in it to fix that. Overall I would purchase again.
5,Just what I needed for our back door,"This was perfect for our back door, which had an uneven crack that was letting in a lot of cold air during the winter (the crack was large at the top and small at the bottom, so most kinds of weather stripping weren't going to work well)."
3,Okay movie,"This one has a problem at the start. You spend you time quickly reading the Spanish interpretation than watching the actual. They speak Spanish so fast that you may have to pause each in order to be able to read it. Other than that, it's a cute movie once (Ana) comes to America. It's a bit slow moving but sweet. A B movie in my opinion."
2,not a chew toy,"I have a Siberian Husky,she chewed the rope off within five minutes. If you want a fetch toy this is okay if your dog would rather chew it's no good."
4,It didn't last long!,"I gave this to my LABRADOR RETRIEVER puppy on her first birthday. She loves tennis balls and when I gave her this she went ""BONKERS"" like a cat does with catnip. The first thing to go was the ROPE. [SHE CHEWED THRU THAT IN ABOUT 10 MINUTES]. Not being able to TOW it around anymore caused her to begin throwing it. The next thing to go was my wife's glass of wine. When I put her in the KENNEL to go to sleep, I put the ""Air Kong Large Fetch Stick"" in her KENNEL too! She was up half the night throwing the ""Air Kong Large Fetch Stick"" against the KENNEL walls. She loves the "" Air Kong Large Fetch Stick with Rope"" but I rated it 4 stars out of 5 because by morning there was very little left!"
1,Not for dogs that like to chew,I bought this toy from a local Petsmart for my 2 yr. old Boxer. He had this toy chewed up within 20 minutes. The rubberband like material broke off into his mouth very easily. I recommend this toy ONLY if you only want to play fetch with this toy. Do not let your dog chew on it!!
5,"Kong Air Dog Fetch Stick with Rope, large, yellow","My Black labs LOVE these things! They will fetch all day long or unitl I get tired of throwing them. They are easy to throw, provide a good and varied bounce and hold up pretty well. They are not a chew toy, although one of my labs thinks it okay to bite off the rope, bummer. When that happens, they get a shorter throw, but they don't care. After lots of fetching and abuse, the cover begins to come off. After the cover is torn completely off and the tug of war between the two dogs it ends up in two pieces. Time for another. I buy these a dozen at a time! They last as well as anything else I have purchased. To purchase locally they cost $14.99. What a rip! Great company service and excellent delivery time."
2,Not like other durable Kong products.,"I bought the large version of this toy for my lab/shepard mix who is 65 pounds. My dog can go through toys pretty quickly so I tend to stick with brands that create the most durable toys to make my money last a little longer. The rope on this toy is made of nylon, not canvas like some of the other kong toys, and because it is made of nylon my dog ripped through the toy in less than 5 minutes. I literally opened the toy and by the time I turned around it was in two pieces. I gave it two stars because I was still able to use the fetch part of the toy without the rope."
4,Great toy,"Bought this for my Great Dane and it has lasted quite well. She doesn't tear at the tennis ball material nearly as much as the rope, but I would recommend this product to anyone with a playful dog."
2,Won't buy again,"Am always on the look for toys for my Border Collie. He loves to keep himself entertained with a box load of toys. If only I could get his to put them back when he's finished playing with them... I tried this toy with him, but it didn't last very long. Pity because usually Kong Toys are of good quality. Unfortunately this one wasn't."
1,Total junk!,We've owned numerous Kong brand dog toys and they have all been quite durably built. Our dog chewed on this for literally 5 minutes or less after we gave it to him and it was torn to pieces. It's a total piece of junk and I'm getting my money back!
5,Great beach toy!,"My mother's Lab/Pitbull mix loves to swim. We quickly realized he needed his own when we took him to the dog beach and he completely ignored other dogs, people, and treats. He dived straight into the water and swam after everyone else's toy instead.This toy is great for fetch at the beach. It's light and easy to throw and will go a good distance, plus it floats. The neon color means he sees it easily in the water, and he'll play fetch with this thing for hours (literally -- we get bored before he does).It's obviously not meant as a chew toy (really people, the name says Air Dog and the packaging says Tennis Fetch Toy), so it's not going to withstand your dog's chewing. We keep this away from him unless we're going to the beach, because he'll destroy it otherwise."
1,Horrible Story!,"For the Love of Mike! by Muriel Jensen wa such a horrible story that I couldn't force myself to finish it! The characters are lifeless and the plot (what I read of it) was boring. Not the usual norm for Ms. Jensen (nothing personal), sorry! It was almost as though a high school girl wrote the book?"
3,A bit simplistic,"There are, in fact, 176 ways to involve parents in this book.I just think there are that many original ideas in it. But if you're looking for a good overview, maybe a checklist of things you've tried to make sure you don't miss an obvious avenue this would be a good book to have around."
5,precision,This book has made a difference in the accuracy of my quilt blocks. I was having trouble with my blocks coming out the rightsize and with the seams all matching. The information in this book has helped resolve these issues. It is great reference book.
3,Precision Piecing redux,"While there are a few new tips and techniques in this volume by the quite talented Sally Collins, I felt that much of the book was a rewriting of her earlier volume, ""Mastering Precision Piecing - Print on Demand Edition"", which in and of itself is a masterwork on quilting technique for anyone from beginner to expert. Of the two volumes, I much prefer the ""Precision Piecing"". While I am not disappointed in the book, one or the other would be adequate for a quilter's library."
2,Very average product,"MBR-100 does not do justice to its functionality at all. Bluetooth connectivity is bad and slight obstructions cause it to ""break"" the music streaming. I use my Nokia N82 to stream the music to this device. As long as I am in the same room with my phone and device, the connections works properly. But using it with my phone in the kitchen/hallway nd this device in the room causes a lot of skips and misses. And I thought I could listen to the songs wirelessly without the need to go to the room again and again to change tracks. Very dissappointed."
3,Doesn't Work with iPhone,Can't really review this product because it wouldn't pair with my iPhone (3.0). My iPhone would see it but when it denied the password. Talking to Sony customer service was no help -- not sure why a standard like bluetooth wouldn't work with all bluetooth devices. The CS rep was basically telling me that I had to use a Sony phone which negates the entire point of an open standard.
3,Summer Reading Book,This book was purchased for my son's summer reading. He thought the book would have been better. We recieved the book at thetime it was expected.
4,The Big Burn,"I think that The Big Burn was a very precice and educational book. The main carachters were Jarett, a young man wanting to fight fires with his older brother; Seth, An afircan American young man trying to show his pride for his country by joining the army; and Lizbeth, a young women trying to stay and keep her aunt from selling their home. The setting is 1910's, in Idaho and Montana. They over come some goals, and others are crushed. This all adds up untill the climax were all the flames come together and"
3,Vegetarian??,"I wish the description had mentioned that the recipes were vegetarian. I wouldn't have purchased it if I knew this. As a southern cook, I typically steer away from vegetarian recipes. Not only do they not have meat, but usually contain ingredients and spices unpopular w/my southern cuisine. The book was entertaining though."
1,Warning: All recipes are *vegetarian*,Nowhere on the cover is it revealed that this is a vegetarian cookbook. I would not have bought it had the author and publisher revealed the book's near-vegan character. Further it is an unimaginative vegetarian cookbook. There's no recipe in it you haven't seen in a dozen vegetarian cookbooks.Boycott this book for its dishonesty and mediocre recipes.
3,Apocalypse Chow,"This book is exactly what it advertises itself to be. It's interesting and potentially (let's hope not) necessary. After Katrina, I think we all know we need to be better prepared to take care of ourselves and not depend on the government. This book is one tool that assists in preparedness."
3,Complicated,"I can see what some mean by high brow. This full of recipes with numerous ingredients you seldom use. Some sound good and look fairly simple. However, I can't see myself wanting to open several cans and use all these ingredients in an emergency situation. Another thing that bothers me about this is the amount of trash that would be generated at a time trash pickup is unlikely (to say the least).I could see this type of cooking for a day or two, maybe a week. In a long term situation its not practical."
3,Emergency Food,"This book is fine if you're looking to build a small emergency stash of food for a few days and how to cook it. Good foods, good recipes. Basic book for preparing to eat after a disaster.I was looking more for a book on how to cook from long term food storage and make it taste fabulous. I'll keep for the recipes but most of the other information was a little to light for me. I'm into serious one-yr plus food storage."
3,not many storage tips,"pretty good book, informative on the surface. not much depth. lots of good general info, looking for more shelf life times - too many recipies with catchy names. need basics.overall - good for someone with no survival skills at all."
4,More than good recipes,"Though the title might lead you to believe it might be all about cooking, this is a well researched book about preparedness. If you're ready for some practical ideas and information on bracing for a storm, enjoy Jon Robertson's entertaining book on how to get through it.With wife Robin, the chef, they tell how their life experiences in roughing it inspired a new look into a dark refrigerator and thawing freezer. They created a shopping list for food and kitchen equipment to challenge the perils of many a dark and stormy night.There is a discussion about heat sources for cooking and lots of recipes on quick-cook (fuel efficient) cuisine from cans and boxes. And don't forget the wine.You learn a lot about hurricanes and endless days of powerlessness, darkness, cabin fever: using the preparation of food as entertainment, camaraderie and a way to stay physically and emotionally fit.Nancy Overton is the author of ""A Checklist/ Making a Family Plan For Emergencies""."
5,Great find.,"This book was a great find. I have never read such a down-to-earth theology. By incorporating history into the dialogue, the author exposes potential bias' in their beliefs and allows the reader to reflect on potential personal bias' which cloud biblical teachings. I truely appreciate the work though it is not written in the classical style but rather from notes and interviews with the author. It deserves a greater audience and further interation than the ""bumper sticker"" generatioin is often willing to give. A must read for anyone who considers himself/herself a ""biblical Christian."""
5,Very Thought Provoking!!,If you only buy one theology book in your life this is the one to buy. The author uses a narrative approach in order to help the reader understand how our spiritual forefathers wrestled with understanding the scriptures. I would highly recommend this work to anyone that is interested in the house church movement or just looking for great theology book. A Believers Church Theology will inspire you to go deeper and appreciate our spiritual heritage.
3,OK,This fan is ok. I don't get the hype. It is kind of quiet. Keeping the cpu cool is just ok-there are better fans out there.
4,The 2nd of Makoto's album's; Pretty good.,"1. This is Makoto's 2nd album and if you like the first one (a must buy), then you should get this. Although not as good as the first one (obviously a personal opinion), this album nonetheless, has some gems."
2,Road Map for the Literally Lost,"Using a reading guide for Shakespeare is like making love with a manual--potentially useful but far more awkward than just diving in. Much like Coles Notes and other ""reading guides,"" this particular version detracts from the beauty of the language itself and focusses too much on content. Read the play, sans notes, or even better, go watch it."
1,Razor Rebellion,"My experience with Razor to this point has been less than adequate.4 weeks have past and I have had two choppers sent to my door and both of them had broken gas tanks. The second chopper also had unchargeable batteries. I was told that this is due to the fact that the units are assembled in China and shipped to the US and are susceptible to damage. I am currently waiting for a replacement gas tank and new batteries.Meanwhile, my son's summer get's shorter and shorter while he waits.If you order one of these, be prepared to send it back - it will probably be broken."
5,Touring band 2K3,A great band at the height of thier powers. Returning to New York City the first time after 9/11. Pearl Jam shows the power of a band with something to prove....A must for even a casual fan.
3,Not to good...,"This was a pretty shotty CD, the quality was bad. Singing some times out of key. I love Pearl Jam but this was their worst live album I've heard. They didn't play some of their hits as well.Still not bad, only cost me 12 bucks new."
1,How not to do cross-cultural work on homosexuality,"This book is a very trite, simplistic compilation of other people's work, plus some pieces by the editor (who seems to presents himself as the author), based on no first-hand acquaintance with the problems at hand."
5,I love it!,"This is one of those things you don't realize how much you needed until you got it. It's a small battery powered hard drive (1.8 inch) that has enough intelligent circuitry to do the job. If you're on a long trip and the memory card is full on your camera, you just connect it to this and press backup. It makes a new directory for each time you connect, until the unit is full. Getting the pictures and video onto your computer is as simple as plugging it into a USB port, it turns itself on and connects. This is also the first gadget I've had with an OLED display, and it's better than any LCD I've seen. I would say run out and get one, but it seems they've disappeared off the market."
3,"video cut out on s-video, interlaced playback","similar to the problem described by another poster with video cutout during component playback. my player cuts out on s-video playback at nearly every new chapter and in scenes of visual or audio intensity. He said his did not cut out on s-video interlaced playback, while mine does. Mine does not cut out on composite playback. I do not have component inputs to test. Problem occured in two of four movies watched, both chinese language films with english subtitles. One was a brand new superbit version of crouching tiger hidden dragon, the other Farewell My Concubine. Two English language films were fine.Playback of the two problematic films was fine when playedback from the dvd player on my laptop through the same s-video cable into the same s-video input on my TV. So it definately seems like the JVC player has the problem. I'm assuming its a defective machine and not a wide problem."
3,This DVD Player is not as good as it looks to be.,"The JVC XV-FA95GD DVD Player plays dvd movies good, but it does not play back music cds very well. I've listened to music cds I've bought from the store and some of them skip on this particular player. I thought maybe their was something wrong with the cd but it played back normal on a standard cd player.Also when I scan through songs on the dvd player sometimes the dvd player locks up and then I have to shut the dvd player off and turn it back on again for it to unlock. And this dvd player does'nt have an adjustable fader on the remote or on the unit itself to lower the output volume. If your going to buy this particular player for standard music cd playback don't because its garbage."
4,clarifications,"this player (as well as the F85) comes in three colors:gold (FA95)silver (FA92)black (FA90)some people complained that it didn't come in silver.also, no dvd-audio player has a digital output. it's only 6.1 analog out.as for the product, it is the best overall player in its price range. do your research before you pontificate."
3,It's okay but...,"Pro: I like this workout because of the way it is formatted -- 3 different workouts, each pretty short and not too fussy. It moves at a good pace that I feel comfortable working at. I use this DVD mostly to have someone count for me and tell me when to switch to a different move. Also, I am able to finish the workout which is a motivator for me because it's not so hard that I feel like a failure half-way through it!Con: The models are so unenthusiastic that the video actually calms (bores?) me. The belly ring comments are highly irritating. I try not to look at the screen during the workout and try even harder to ignore the ""you wanna wear a midriff shirt / belly ring?"" comments.Negatives aside, I think the pros outweigh the cons for me and so I continue to do the workout about twice a week."
2,"Not challenging, but good technique.","I'm not a beginner and I didn't find this workout challenging, even with weights. The instructor claims that this is the only workout you need to do, but I doubt it. The form and technique is important and they do stress that. A beginner may enjoy this workout because of the stress on form. There are three workout sessions, each with three exercises to do. Only the second and the third workout session was of interest. Personally, I really didn't like the way he talked to the women in the video. Just seemed a little not like a workout video, if you know what I mean. I will be giving this video to someone, maybe they will like it more than I did."
1,For Beginners Only!,"We were greatly disappointed with this video. We had been using Abs of Steel (which was great) for several months and were ready for something more challenging. This is definitely NOT it. The video is definitely directed toward women and only has a few basic excersizes, none of which are very challenging. We were more bored than anything else and even using weights or other resistance isn't going to lead to any serious abs. In short, it's probably very good for someone who has never done any ab exersizes at all, though I would suggest Tammy's Abs of Steel over Look Great Naked anytime."
4,Look great naked abs with results,"I have been borrowing this dvd from a someone and its a great workout! I seen results in a couple of days of using this dvd. The instructor is a little freaky and the girls looks bored or unhappy but thats not what its about, its about results and i feel it has good results!!"
4,Luis Rodriguez-Salazar,"FUN FACTORY - Sha-La-La-La-Lawritten by Luigi Ricco (Luis Rodriguez-Salazar), JoBel (Lian Ross), Al Walser21.07.1999 Marlboro Music (BMG) Maxi-CD 74321 66187-29"
4,quick delivery,"Arrived really fast in packaging advertised - I had ordered 6, one had been opened and taped closed rather sloppily but the case was okay and the blade seemed to be sharp."
2,Character Assasination of Charles Taylor,"While I believe the loss of Flight 19 to be nothing more than a tragic accident, the careless use of second and third hand characterizations of Charles Taylor as a sloppy flyer or a drunk is libelous. Charles Taylor fought bravely in the Pacific during WWII and deserves better. I doubt we'll ever know all the factors that caused the tragedy, but to only blame Taylor is irresponsible. There was enough blame to go around (especially the ground crew), and factors beyond anyone's control (bad weather, poor radio reception). While some objectivity is neccessary, it seems as though Kusche doesn't like Taylor, and this dislike overshadows the entire book."
2,doesnt smell like bruy,i have alot of brut products and although the packaging is nice it just doesnt smell like brut
4,The sick tension of covert ops,"Project IGI: ""I'm Going In"" successfully creates a realistic military experience in which stealth and planning are valued over gun-blazing action. The graphics are not the best, although they were good when the game was originally released. Guns can shoot through walls, sounds are half decent, and missions are relatively long. One major draw-back is the lack of a game save function! This seems inexplicable compared to other games in this genre.There is no way to save a game in the middle of your mission. I believe this creates a level of tension and paranoia that must partially mimic what an actual soldier would feel, well-armed, but alone (save for Anya in the ear-piece) in hostile territory. The landscapes are expansive because the engine used came from a flight simulator game. The voice acting is great, better than the sequel (IGI2:Covert Strike).Plot is a relatively familiar arms dealer/nuclear terrorism plot."
5,Great,"Pronounced is the best American Band released CD in 1973, (Darkside of the Moon by a British Band). Most people look at Free Bird and just assume it is good, but it is not good, it is great. ""I Ain't the One"" is a great rocker, ""Tuesday's Gone"" is a great bluesy type tune. Gimme Three Steps"" everyone has heard this one. ""Simple Man"" is the best song on the album. ""Things Goin' On"" is one of the best singalong songs ever, great lyrics. ""Mississippi Kid"" is also great, for God's sake it has a mandolin in it. ""Poison Whiskey"" is the second best track on the whole CD. ""Free Bird"" well, it's Free Bird. The most requested song in FM radio history. Sell your dog to buy this."
5,"""Pronounced"" is the Sistine Chapel of Southern rock.","it is a musical achievment of such virtuosity and unparalleled excellence, that it has become the measure by which all other works of art and achievement in every field of endeavor are judged..."
5,Piece of Cake,"My ceiling fan had the almost identical remote control that worked flawlessly for more than 7 years. When it finally died, I purchased the Westinghouse control to replace it. Installation was easy and took just about 20 minutes. It works great and I expect it will last a long time."
4,Totally works,"Not the prettiest bit of industrial design and it ships with the set-up codes mismatched to defaults for the receiver, but otherwise great."
4,BUILT WELL & PRICED RIGHT !!!,BUILT WELL & PRICED RIGHT !!!VERY HAPPY with PRODUCT !!!Only 2 draw backs... (1) Sometimes you have to hit a button more than once to respond (but always works) and (2) It's a little bit bulky in size.Overall has great features for it's price and I have had no problems with it (been using for over a year now).
3,Fan controller setup,"Shakespeare, set the switches in the controller to match the switches in the fan then install batteries and you should be off to the races. Nothing else to do.My Hampton Bay controller (seems identical to the Westinghouse) has a bum fan speed switch so I am not impressed but the concept is good."
3,I like it,"It does what I wanted to do, which was make my switch covers match my bathroom tile. My only complaint is that, with the GFCI covers I was given short little screws (which is normal for this type of plate) but the screws aren't long enough to go through the entire plate and secure to the wall. I had to dig up some longer screws."
2,Frankly I expect more for the money,"This little book is a small format, very short little book, perhaps not 100 pages, poor quality paper, paper back. It is hard to take a book seriously if the printing, paper, format, binding, etc are done at a level of a child's coloring book. The information is good, the presentation is seriously lacking."
1,Poor Design,"I wish I had read the previous review prior to purchasing this toy. The bubble chamber is in the mouth of the shark, so if you tilt the toy slightly, the bubbles pour out all over the toy and your child. The chamber is empty within seconds and the toy (and child) are quickly a mess. When bubbles got into the air hole (also in the mouth) the toy stopped working. Total playing time before the toy was broken - 2 min. Don't buy."
4,Fun Bubble Blower!,"I bought this at a great price from Amazon, and it is alot of fun! Very durable and my child enjoys all the bubbles it makes!"
4,Great speakers - especially for the price.,Bought these for $100 from an Amazon merchant. Was surprised how easily these installed. If you haven't installed in-wall speakers before I definitely would recommend getting a drywall saw (about $10 from Home Depot) instead of trying to use a utility knife. The saw is so much easier. The speakers come with a stencil where you can draw the exact size hole and then cut away! Any mistakes are covered up very neatly by the speakers overlap. They look awesome once they are up. The sound was also very high quality...especially these were only $100 for a pair. I own other high very quality speakers (Wharfedales) and these sound as good.
3,The giant chained,"A standard collection of Robeson recordings from the early thirties, when his voice was at its finest but before his social and political beliefs had influenced his singing. Several songs on this album were embarassments to Robeson in his later years, particularly ""That's why darkies were born"". Robeson's voice rings like a bell, but the sentiments are reprehensible. Robeson himself regreted recording these songs."
5,Really fun book,"I loved the mystery and romance. The book kept me interested the whole time. I usually read paranormal romances, but this traditional romance novel kept my full attention. I finished in one day."
2,disappointment,"Although the description of the book sounded interesting, I was disappointed in the book itself. It seemed to drag in the middle and I found myself skipping forward to see if it picked up speed. I finished the book but probably would not purchase another by this author. I did not read any other reviews of this book prior to purchase, so maybe there were other similar opinions. However, I would not discourage anyone else from purchasing this book since they may not have the same reaction as I did."
3,Oven to go,"This is a great item, the only problem is it only last for about 8 months then it doesn't warm up anymore. I purchase two already and exactly 8 months later it stop working."
2,Better for heating than for cooking,Bought this for my work truck to have hot meals. I can't see cooking something with this unless you are driving long distances. I use it mainly to heat things up for a hot lunch. It will make things hot but it takes about an hour to go from cold to hot enough to eat. It does what I need it to do.I had to change my rating (orginally 4 stars) because it stopped working after I used it about 10 times.
1,Not what was pictured,"I ordered this as a Christmas gift, and the mittens that came were NOT what was pictured. I got some black mittens with a very unattractive embroidered golf ball on a tee, that said golf. Yes they are heat factory mittens, but no where did I see anything about an embroidered golf logo. Strange. It is also true that they are very thin and should be worn as an additional mitten.Just be aware that the picture is NOT accurate."
3,Let the Power be Explored......Fully,"When restarting his solo career in earnest in 1994, Robert Fripp updated his Frippertronics technique with digital technology - instead of tapes - to create loops of sounds.The Soundscapes projects included six CD releases of new material and a ""single"" collection of two releases.The cutting-edge textures are oftentimes quite metallic and non-melodic, but Fripp is attempting to expand the potential of the electric guitar. But with the laboratory being the stage, sometimes the interpretation is not as strong when a complete performance is not heard.It would be fantastic that - at some point - the sets which comprised the recording would be released in its entirety."
1,disappointing,"Begining of third chapter, it start confusing me with no detail explanation for what he is talking about! I get so much frustrating. Finally I gave up reading this piece of junk. Personally, I think this book is not appropriate for people who never have experience about image processing in any language, and this book is not appropriate for anyone in the world except the author."
2,Strain to read ...,"This book is littered with very poor grammar, layout and typesetting from cover to cover making it a difficult and painful read for a technical book. The enclosed CD rom comprises a heap of code, very poorly formatted (and expressed) lecture notes and unrelated information. This book is also very mathematical and as such would not be recommended to a novice."
2,"Students only, not for programmers","An average image processing book written by an average college professor, who choose to teach in Java. May be good enough for his students. But there nothing really new and exciting in the book. A good refresh for programmers, but don't ever use the code in your program, because it's definitely not production quality.It's a joke to use RGB average as gray scale (page 41). The formating of this book is the bigest joke. It's using 18pt per line, 4 lines per inch. Normal book uses 12pt per line, 6 lines per inch. So this book should be 330 pages instead of 500 pages.Reading this book convinces me that Java is not language for any time consuming job."
2,What do Frames have to do with Image Processing?,"If you were to design an IP system, you'd use classes with names like Image, Color, Filter, LUTFilter, Histogram or something *remotely* resembling that, right? Not here. If anything this book is an exercise in completely ignoring the problem domain wrt OO Design. The functionality of the system is hidden, more like intentionally encrypted, in a GUI hierarchy of Frames.Ever been behind someone trying to go past who not only wouldn't move, but seemed to know you were behind him and just stood still out of spite? That is the air of this book towards good OO design.The book does have some redeeming value in its discussion of the FFT and wavelet transforms."
1,A big disappointment,"I was so excited to see this title as I am struggling with some interesting image processing problems in Java but I'm afraid it will be the first book I return. It says ""Java 2.0 compatible"" in red on the cover, and stricly speaking it is (as is all Java 1 code), but it doesn't use any of Swing or Graphics2d. Code developed with this as a base will have to be ported (as the book itself admits around page 377).The OO design is also poor - most everything extends Frames (the final class developed is at the end of a chain of 9(!) classes linearly extending Frame) rather than Panel or Canvas so a lot has to be rewritten to be reused in more general programs.There are also some Java errors in the book in the 2-d array area. Finally, the book is rather ugly inside - bad fonts, bad alignment etc. Prentice Hall should issue a recall. I'm trying to extract some gems of image processing wisdom but the connection to Java is rather tenuous and should be skipped over."
5,Good resource,"C'mon now, let's be fair. This CD is not intended as a learning vehicle for Javascript. Rather, it is a resource for programmers who need solutions to specific problems. I have run quite a few of the sample scripts on this CD, and I am impressed at both the quality and the complexity of the code. These are scripts that ACTUALLY WORK, a refreshing change from the hundreds of amateurish scripts on those archive sites, 90% of which are buggy, crash your browser, or worse. I was able to cut-and-paste code from this CD into my web page, and get it working (AND doing something useful!) in just a few minutes. My only complaint is that there could have been a few more business-oriented applications (such as a shopping cart)."
5,an excellent book!,"As many professors in China recommend, it is an excellent book by a great Geometrician. Though it may not be a beginning book, it should appear on your shelf as a classic one!"
3,To readers of this book,"I am reading this book now. It is as the other reviewers said,rather condensed. However, it would not be beyond comprehensionif the crucial pictures are established. It is my personal opinion that the first crucial place where it should be understood without any compromise is the section on the frame bundle. Later chapters build on this. Previous chapters aresynthesized here. To any readers who are interested, you are invited to discuss this book. My email address is topollogy@hotmail.com (Notice there are two ""l"" in ""topollogy"")"
3,dense book,"This book contains most important material in differential geometry in about 330 page. No exercise, few exaples make this book very dense, which is just the style of Chinese professors.It deserves cautions that in chapter 8, Chern introduce the connection proposed by himself in 1948, which is the proper tools for finsler geometry."
4,sticky,"-shipped out and received very quick-sticks to surfaces well, expands a good amount and is fairly dense upon setting-really, really, really sticky. There is a solvent to remove it mentioned on the can, but if you don't have the proper solvent to remove it before it sets handy, if it gets on your clothes it won't come off, if it gets on your hands it doesn't come off for many days (warning label says to wear gloves though), if it gets on anything you don't want it on, it will later need to be scraped or sanded off, it doesn't just easily peel off or wipe off, very difficult to remove. I'm not saying that's a bad thing for the product, just saying to watch out for those things in case they are relevant to you.-dispensing nozzle seals itself shut after the first use, so don't expect to save the can for a future use unless you get creative-4 stars instead of 5 because it is only one time use, it would be nice to be able to store it and use it for future uses."
1,straw holder breaks and stops up after use,"dont buy this product,if the top breaks you have lost a whole can if the straw breaks you have lost the whole can"
2,Not worth the trouble,Bought several cans of this a few years ago and had two of them fail to dispense properly. Just appeared to clog up before you were able to use the product. Too expensive to throw away but HD wouldn't take it back.
1,how horrible this crap is,i used this to fill a couple of holes with this and it works good except on the label it tells to use acetone to remove from surfaces and mechanically comes off the skin. i read some of the other reviews and this crap does not come off easily. on the front of the bottle needs to read WEAR FULL BODY SUIT OR SOMETHING because this crap takes days and days to remove. i scrubed on my hands 8 hrs straight and i still have it on my hands and your skin comes off before the product does
5,Easy replacemetn of old wired-in detectors.,"Upgraded from 10-year-old wired smoke detectors to add Co detection as well. I haven't had any false alarms or other issues. Took less than 3 minutes to replace old bracket (two screws),unplug old unit and plug in new one. Worth the peace of mind knowing I have good detectors. I did not realize these are supposed to be replaced every 10 years until I started looking into CO detectors in general after my daughter forgot to open the gas fireplace damper one night."
3,Easy replacement,"I have six of these in my house and the ones the contractor installed in 2006 when the house was built were chirping randomly asking for their battery to be replaced. Replace the battery and they'd chirp again a week later. It was driving me crazy.So I found this six pack of replacements and ordered them. They were very easy to install. Some reported having to replace the trim rings. I did not have to do that. The detectors themselves attached perfectly to the existing trim rings and all I had to do was pop the electrical connector out of the old one and plug it in to the new one. I replaced all six detectors in about 15 minutes.I would give this product 5 stars for ease of installation, but I have the feeling I'll be doing the same thing again in 4-5 years because the product itself is not well made (they are supposed to last for 10 years).My detectors were manufactured December 2012 and I got them 1/24/2013 so the stock they are sending out currently is definitely not old stock."
1,First Alert 120-volt Wire-in w/ Battery Backip Smoke Alarm,I orderd six of the smoke alarms. The items that arrived had no battery backup. I contacted the seller and they apologized and said they did not have any of the item they advertised. They paid for return shipping and issued a full refund. I purchased the correct items elsewhere and they are a nightmare. As in most other reviews of the same item they let out 1 long beep at all hours of the day and night for no reason. This causes doubt in the proper workings of the product and therefore useless.
1,They all go off at once!,"These things are horrible! The units we have are under 4 years old (installed when the house was built) and they go off in the middle of the night for no reason... the worst part is that if 1 unit goes off, the rest sense it and they ALL GO OFF! The result is running around the house at 2am ripping every one of them out of the ceiling. After last night... 3rd strike and they are out! I will be replacing every single one of these things with another brand!"
3,Smoke alarm First Alert,"I ordered this product from a company on Amazon.com but they could not deliver because they did not stock it{go figure}. So I ordered the same unit from Home Depot, and got it for a better price , and faster shipping. It was a breeze to install ,and works just fine. i would recommend it as a replacement for your outdated model."
5,Seamless,I was hesitant about ordering this product after reading some of the reviews. I took a chance and am very satisfied with the product. Very convenient - 6 pack (back up batteries included) was the right amount to replace all of my existing detectors. Exact replacement which made installation seamless. Entire installation process took about 15 minutes. The detectors have been installed for almost a month and to date I haven't had one false alarm. So far so good.
4,Smoke detectors,Direct replacement for the older model. Plugged right in without having to re-wire each unit. New easier one button test and reset. Works great.
1,Malfunctioning after 2 years.,"We installed these in our new home (built in 2010), with a manufacturing date on the units of March 2010. They go off for no reason as other reviewers have commented (often at about 2am). We even built our house new, so no left over smoke - I'm not sure what sets them off. I have reset them per the instructions and cleaned them with compressed air, again as the instructions advised, but they still randomly go off.While the house-wide alert is nice for a real fire, when they are repeatedly false alarms it's horribly annoying. Once these things go off, I'm up for the night. Last night (July 24, 2012) was the third time this has happened, just like another reviewer, so we are throwing these blasted things away and finding something different. BE WARNED SHOPPERS!"
4,First Alert smoke alarm,"I don't have any problem with the alarms yet. I am hoping it will last, the same as the older type alarm I had"
2,edition not clarified,"I have the 1981 edition of this book. It should prove useful as I create my own taxonomic keys for smaller areas of botanic interest within the northern Califorina region. It might be important to consider that there are numerous editions most recent was 1993. Also, the one advertised here on Amazon as 'new' does not specify the edition or publishing date."
3,Bookcondition,"The book is great and I am enjoying using it - however it was in really bad condition and the binding completely fell apart, I only paid $1.50 so it still was worth it."
3,Not so good for MP3s,"This unit does it's job for playing DVDs. Normal picture quality is fine although I'm not able to take advantage of it's progressive scan capabilities with my regular TV. The zoom function is pretty cool. The remote is ok to use with my JVC TV but it has no ""last channel"" button. The unit is noisy when switching disks - sounds like it's going to fall apart! It will only play MP3s on a ""closed"" CDR, and will not play at all from a CDRW. Also, it will only play them in order, from 1 to whatever. No random, no program. There are other units (I think Harmon Kardon makes one) that have better MP3 support. On the plus side, I was able to get rid of my 5 CD player. It has a very good manual. I can live with the noisy disk changing as long as it doesn't break, but I give it 3 stars because of it's poor MP3 support (which was a selling point for me)"
3,MP3 unsupport,"OK, The DVD end works good as does the CD part. However I have had a very hard time playing MP3's burned with 4 different programs: Roxio, Nero, Cd recorder and musicmatch 7.0,, They all work withg real players supporting MP3, like the portable players for about [price]. The mp3 player was one of my interests with this unit, now because of its inconsistency you may find yourself buying a mp3 jukebox"
5,Excellent resource!,"This is an excellent source for those who wish to improve their taekwondo forms. Mr. Rosbarsky shows the forms in full competition speed, step by step and it even shows it step by step from two different view points at the same time with the instruction written in text on the screen so you can easily pause the video and do it yourself. A great resource! My only quibble is that sometimes the sound is a little bit quiet when Mr. Rosbarsky is speaking. I wish I had this video when I was learning my forms!"
4,Palgwe nuances,"I bought this as a bit of a refresher on the poomse and to see how others do this series of poomse. Good for learning the palgwe in this way. Given you are presented with three examinations of the poomse, you are able to see and learn what is done in each poom as well as his interpretations of pace. I would like to have seen some emphasis upon hand placement and kicking levels. There are a couple techniques/poom that I have learned little differently and I have concentrated on other series since USAT does not use palgwe in competitions. The pace and the techniques were otherwise good."
2,Not for me,"I ended up returning these. I'm prone to getting pain in my knees and hip joints when I don't wear the right shoes, and I found that the heels/soles of these boots were too narrow to distribute my weight comfortably on my feet (I'm normal weight). Also, the openings of these boots were rough and rubbed like crazy against my shins. I only wore these out twice and with long socks, but I had scars on my shins for a couple of months afterwards from all the rubbing. These boots look very nice, so I would have loved to keep them, but they just didn't work for me."
1,not effective,"I bought this when I ran out of ""Pluck no more"". It was cheaper and available. It has isopropyl in it and smells like rubbing alcohol. My lovebird went back to plucking herself until she draws blood. I will go back and purchase the more expensive brand. She had gone up to 3 weeks without plucking with the original brand I purchased."
1,does not work,"Hi,I am looking for a link to let you know that this product only squirted two or three times and has not worked since. We've tried to fix the nozzle and it still doesn't work, so we have no idea if the product helps or not. Can we get a refund?thanks, LauraGrannick Bitter Apple Spray for Birds 4oz (Purchased on 11/02/2011)"
5,Love it!!,I have always loved Branda Lee...I find myself listening to this more than I thought..love her raspy voice. She is a wonderful singer. If you like her you will love this CD.
4,Brenda Lee's Soul Captured on a Disc,"Brenda Lee is a big stack of dynamite packed in a tiny frame. This CD contains just about all her soulful/country hits and a few less well-known numbers. About the only big hit missing is ""Rocking Around the Christmas Tree,"" which definately belongs on the disc. Still, this CD will take you back to the early days, invoking memories along the way. Enjoy!"
5,"For Brenda fans, this collection is a must!","This collection has a wide range of what makes Brenda Lee the unique talent that she is! In fact, it's some of her lesser-known recordings that I am particularly fond of: Losing You, Emotions, etc. What a voice! And the arrangements are marvelous. But who could ever resist her classic, ""Break It To Me Gently""? No one can sing that like Brenda can. This collection is truly a must for Brenda Lee fans. They're ALL here!"
5,Psychic theft,"If I didn't know better, I would have thought the author stole all the best parts of this novel from me. But, of course, that would be impossible - unless he be some sort of mind-reader. Don't try to get it, just internalize it. This book will grow on you and invade your dreams in subtle ways for years to come. One day, while raking leaves or taking an antacid in your somewhat advanced years, you'll say out loud ""Oh, I get it..."""
3,The class' courseware is better,"The book is uninspiring to read. The book spends too much time discussing far flung control systems (space shuttle, airplanes), rather then working out examples. Where's the beef? Luckily the courseware in my class was better"
1,OMG Are professors being paid to choose this book.,"This book is at best confuseing,,,At worst it is junk. I have read every page of this book at least twice. I still find some of the concepts impossible to understand. I will still get a b in the class. But at two hundred dollars per credit hour plus 150 for this trash. I got ripped."
3,The sound is great!,"The sound on this sub is great. However in the item description it mention that the speaker was a new speaker. When i received it there was a crack at the bottom. Still works though, However I prefer to have a new one :/"
4,good subs if you know what your doing,This subs are good if you know how to hook them up. These other people are idiots and don't do there homework. There not high quality subs there just pyle if you want something to bang get some 15's you idiot. There 120 watts rms continous power and 600 max. I'm thinking bout getting them so that i can fit luggage and take my 2 15're audios out. I will be hooking up a california profile ap400 watt amp which is 200 watts at 4 ohm bridge giving them 200 each or 65 watts rms each channell. Know what your doing with these subs and they sound good there not gonna bang your brains out like my 15s but they will definatly fill in the missing bass that your factory speakers don't hit.
1,SUCKS,"Ordered the speakers and when they came in, I was getting ready to install and I was connecting the wires and noticed the wire harness for the connection which is just 2 braided wires one on each side have fell off. Luckly I know how to solder and have a solder gun so I resoldered the connections and made it work. I recommend not to buy this item at all, you get what you pay for, if you dont trust me oh well your lost."
1,badddddddddd,I got 3 of the speakers and all 3 went bad within 2 months I will not get this product again and I will not recommend it.
4,Paper cone,these speakers look and sound pretty decent for the price. i have 2 and they slam. only concern i have is the cone is paper and then coated on face. i dont know how durabale they will be .
3,Not what i expected,"i got 2 of this Pyle PLBW84 Blue Wave 8"" 600W High-powered Subwoofer, i was really excited but to my luck these subwoofers couldn't handle my american pro amplifier of 600 watt, the distortion was more than noticeable... i would recommend this product if you were to use a 400 watt amp or just to hook them without one..."
1,Sucked.,I bought these a while back and they sucked it was a waste of money. I had them for a week and they blew out with an amp that was actually weaker on each channel than the sub woofers them self. I was disappointed wouldn't recommend them. I had another pair of Pyles too and they also lacked in sound quality and performance and I was tired of going with cheap system that blue out so I went with two JL audio W0V2 subwoofers and now those are what you call subwoofers yea there $120 a piece and I also bought a box and amp to go with it. The system ran me up $620 but it was well worth the money compared to the $300 dollars I had wasted on Pyle systems that kept blowing out and cheap boxes that kept falling apart. Let me just say save your money and buy something thats gonna last even if it cost more because its worth it and its better to go with quality over quantity than quantity over quality.
1,Don't waste your money,"Bought this thing 3 months ago, have not been pushing the system because it's so inexpensive (I know it can't take it). About 3 weeks ago, it started rattling on certain songs (""I Got 5 On It"" by Luniz, for example). As of today, this thing is shot. Game over. Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200. There's no sound coming out of this thing at all, and the amp's still fine.The reason it was rattling was because part of the sub became unglued; a plastic ring around the backside of the unit came unattached to the metal it was glued to. I can see that virtually no adhesive was used to hold the thing together."
1,these subs suck,i bought two of these subs about 2 to 3 months ago. they sounded ok at first but i've already blown both and that was with about 250 watts rms to each. never again will i buy pyle subs because that's all they are .... is a big pyle(of crap)
1,These subs SUCK,"I bought these subs, hooked them up to Pyle 1800 watt amp, they blew out within 20 minutes of use and were burning hot. Hooked 2 12inch kickers up to pyle 1800 watt amp n there still hitting hard. Save yourself the headache and waist of time, You get what you pay for, in the case of these subs, You get absolutely nothing."
3,"Haven't put em to full potential, but we'll see.","Came in today, I thought OH BOY!Well, the sub I was replacing was a 12"" (I'm new to this whole thing)The sub came with no screws, no directions, no manual, and no indication of where to put my live and ground wires.But when I get this all settled out, I'm sure it will sound nice."
3,Well worth the money,"I bought a pair of these speakers for my 95 Golf. All my friends laughed at me, saying they will never play bass. Their laughter was quickly silenced when installed the speakers. They are powered by a 300Watt Phoenix Gold amp.The bass will not rattle your mirrors, but it is solid enough to give a great sounding music. They played better than i was expecting for $25. I am very satisfied with them.I recommend them to anyone who is not looking for earth shattering bass or is on a budget."
2,Decent Sound,I bought two of these speakers and they lasted about two weeks. they have really good sound but you cant boom them for long cause they wear out quick.
4,awesome,this sub i awesome it hits pretty hard for being an eight. I have a 500 watt 2 channel CRUSH amp it bridged and i running about 260 watts and you can feel it it my hardbody truck
4,very good sub,"This sub is a very good value considering the cost. I recently put it in a bass tube that i got from a freind and it hits extremely hard for a 8"", you can feel it in your chest. It hasnt stopped amazing me yet!!!"
3,sharpness,very disappointed - knives were not very sharp. In fact they were not even as sharp as the same product I have been using for 10 to 12 years and wanted to replace
4,Very Good and Inexpensive Paring Knife,"The blade takes and holds a very sharp edge (I use a two-stage Japanese whetstone to sharpen it around once a month for regular home use). The handle is a bit square, but fits my medium-sized hand well. A very good value for a sharp, durable, and comfortable paring knife."
5,One of the greatest albums through and through,"Sadly this album was the only record to showcase the wonderful playing and song writing of Steve Gaines with Lynyrd Skynyrd. It makes one wonder what would have been, this album is a return to the awesome power and song writing that embodied the first two Skynyrd releases. From ""What's Your Name""'s catchy chorus and pop sensability to the driveing blues of ""That Smell"" There is not one bad song on this album. I've worn out two LP's and purchased the CD as soon as it came out. This is Lynyrd Skynyrd at their best and rock music at it's best."
4,Helps organize your life plan,"I felt like I needed a reason to live, and this book helped guide me to finding it. There are a lot of reasons to live. This book pretty much covers all of them, at least every category. A good guide to organizing your priorities in life."
3,one's opinion,The author is marriage-centric in his interpretation of life and human purpose for existence. Not recommended for those who venture through life's journey solo.
4,Great gift item,"I bought these as a thank you gift for someone. The recipient told me he enjoyed them. Now, he could have been lying but I don't think so. Shipment came on time as promised."
4,"Son LOVES Maisy, especially b/c we read all the books!","This was a hand-me-down VHS from a cousin. I knew my son would love it b.c he just LOVES the Maisy series of books. He just turned 3, so I thought it would be a little too juvenile for him. He knows all his letters, numbers, etc. But, I was wrong. He LOVES it! However, 1) it's only 30 minutes long and 2) The parade episode has the most annoying and grating sounds in it that play over and over. Eddie the elephant blows his trunk for the entire parade and my husband who is very mellow, wants to put his foot through the t.v.! Of course, son loves it.The 30 minutes may be great for parents who limit television time, though.I ordered a DVD of Maisy which should be great b/c it's got 153 minutes of episodes and we can forward through the ads in the beginning."
5,Goes well with polished brass kickplates,"After installing some truly elegant looking polished brass kick plates to my 2 doors I realized that the doorsweep below each door was chrome and clashed. I ordered 2 of these door sweeps in the polished brass finish and they looked great and went well with the polished brass kick plates. In fact, they made both doors look 100% better and were verY economical in price. Very good looking product that I would recommend."
3,"great plot, not so great writing","When reading Undone I couldn't help but think that Michael Kimball was trying to imitate Stephen King. It seemed like he was trying to write in a way he hasn't quite mastered yet. Although it could have been writeen better, the story line was great. I couldn't put it down. I just had to know what was really going on."
4,Excellent thriller with emotion and great twists,"I think that Michael Kimball is brilliant. How he thought up this twisting, turning plot I'll never know, but it works out sweetly, with such a satisfying story and unique characters. I was completely intrigued by this book. Kimball doesn't treat his readers like idiots; this book is intelligent and crafty and must be paid attention to. He even has time for a few delectable sub-plots. This book is great reading - not too intense, but filled with emotionally involving drama and clever twists. It is just so original, I want everyone I know to read it. I just have to buy them some copies of the book first. This would make one heck of a movie."
2,"A good story, awkwardly written","I found this book hard to read because the wording was so cumbersome and, well, WORDY! Although the story was somewhat entertaining, it was not well developed. I felt like I was reading a first draft, not the final product."
5,"A solid pageturner, keeps you guessing","Michael Kimball's Undone is a classic pageturner. Part whodunit, part noirish thriller and part thriller, this well-written novel has a cast of great charcters mixed up in murder, lust and money in a small MAine town. If you're looking for a book you won't put down, this is it. An entertaining read, and the best book of its type I've read in a long time."
4,"A Blistering, Seductive Read","Undone is a naughty little novel drenched with wicked characters doing equally wicked deeds. This story is dark and mesmerizing at the same time. You can't help but feel for Sal. He's a devoted family man who becomes an unwilling participant in his best friend's ""death scheme"". As the story progresses we are witnesses to a small town drama filled with murder, betrayal and seduction. A classic ""in the wrong place at the wrong time"" type of story that will keep you guessing until the very end. Read this on a day when you have lots of uninterrupted time.Four stars for the unrelenting pace and unforgettable characters.Cris"
3,Who Would You Trust With Your Life?,"A bright Idea, indeed. The book is very interesting, with a very good suspense subject. The things are constantly changing, now you think that someone is the bad guy, then you see that is somebody else, and so on and on. UNFORTUNATELY, this book have a lot to improve in the matter of gaining the Reader Attention -- after all the plot is once settled, the book goes around and around until the reader is tired (and for a day or two, I stopped reading it). AnyWay, it's a good reading, won't last more than a week. Kimball deceives it."
2,"Slightly the ""dumb blond"" version of a book","Besides the story with the rabbit, ""Bunrab"" which was very amusing, the rest are moreless boring. It was a dissapointment after ""Tasting life twice"", which I have found absolutely 5 stars. I guess I was hoping for something ""heavier""..."
1,The Most Awful Recording of Great Violinists,"You are wasting your money if you buy this. I found a similar recordings on LPs in my university library. Compared to them, this CD has the worst sound you can possible hear. The static background noise is so loud that you don't get much out of the CD except the annoying hissing sound. The LPs have much clear sound and less static sound. They were made in the 70's. OPAL claims that this junk CD was remastered with the lasted technology. I wonder what that is.It was impossible to ignore the background noise, but all the pieces were interesting. It is true that they were old when they recorded these pieces, but you can still get much information about their style. I think it's really stupid to compare them with modern violinists. We are talking about different schools and different eras."

Following publication of Nader's book on the Chevrolet Corvair, ""Unsafe At Any Speed"", Nader first suspected he was under surveillance. This is the ""scandal sheet"" of that surveillance."
4,Great Bike!,"I've purchased all three Razor MX bikes 350, 500 and 650 My son loved/s all of them. They are prone to break downs. My son is a husky boy and created his own dirt bike jumps that may cause some of the damage. My tip is to keep your receipts because RAZOR does have great customer service and will replace parts or you can purchase and replace parts. My son is nine and can handle the 650 and was riding the 350 when he was six years old. You will need to determine if you child is ready since the age requirements are higher. We also have a safe place for him to ride and I recently rode the Razor 650 for the first time and now understand why he loves it. It really is a fun starter bike for any kid who loves adventure. Highly recommend all the the MX bikes as affordable starter/training bikes but keep the receipts."
4,gift,"I ordered this as a gift for my son's 13th Bday. He wanted something he could legally ride around the neighborhood. I was a little disappointed that it is touted as an electric dirt bike, but it has very little torque and has trouble getting up the smallest hills unless you have plenty of momentum."
3,"Good bike, bad shipping",The bike is great now that I have all the parts. The box that it was shipped in was in bad shape and parts were missing. I guess that's what you get with free shipping.
1,Nice bike until....,"Bought this bike from toys r us. Came in the mail. Easy to put together, charged it up and away my 9 year old daughter went. It says it's for 16 year olds, but it's really 7 to 9 years of age. Drove well for a while then it stoped. Waited a few minutes and it started again, thinking maybe it overheated or something. Then it stopped again and all you hear is a clicking sound coming from the control box. Sooo there it sits, in my garage. Click click click. Lasted 2 months of daily use in our yard. Can't take it back to the store cause thats what the box says, and it's too big and P In the A to try and ship back. Boooooo."
4,mx650,bought for 11yr old grandson very good bike to learn to ride on would be nice if battery lasted longer but overall am very happy with bike and grandson loves it
4,Super fun!,My kids loved this bike. I bought two of them. True we have gotten lots of use out of them since we bought them. They no longer work and I'm not sure why. I hope to get some more this coming christmas if the price is right.
4,GRATE BUT,I love this bike only reason i gave it 4 starts cause it should have head lights ;) and it should go faster then 14mph at least 20This is very heavy duty i tested my self over the bumps and everything.
4,MX650 Gotta Love It!,"We purchased this electric dirt bike for our 6 soon to be 7 year old son for Christmas. Very easy to put together. Some problems with front disk brakes being to tight and not adjusting out enough to get brake disk into. I had to force it to get it in. However, other than this one set up problem the bike has ran flawlessly. My son has gas motorcycle experience so teaching him to ride it was to say get on and go! WE wanted electric now that we have moved into town and needed to cut out then noice of the 2 cycle. We are very pleased with our purchase and would recommend this bike to others."
3,unsatisfied,the motor burned out after two days. it is still under warranty. i have been waiting on the replacement motor for two weeks. after it is fixed i am sure it will be fine. we had a mx350 and it has been great so i am sure this will yurn out fine. but until then i can not give a good review.
1,"NOT for over 100 lbs, and not for dirt.","A couple of kids in our neighborhood have this bike and really like it - after speaking with them, we thought we'd get it for Christmas for our son. The first bike was damaged in shipping, so we didn't receive a usable one until the end of December. My son is a lot taller and therefore weighs more than these kids, but is still well under the max 220 lb guidelines for the bike. He weighs about 150. This bike is NOT built for anyone over 100 lbs. It was continually breaking down, after having Razor send us repair parts 3 times in the first 3 months, we finally decided to return it to Amazon and receive a PARTIAL refund . Please note, the warranty is ONLY 90 days! That is not enough time to work out the issues with this bike. We never felt like the brakes were safe or responsive. It might be OK for road/sidewalk use, but not for hills, dirt or mud. Just not enough power. Very disappointing."
1,Bad dream,"May be I didn't have lucky from the beginning of this negotiation but the first time I got the product , few times used got broken, they replace and now the nuew one ithe chain is broken after 5 minutes use so....somebody tell me what I have to do, because return is a big problem.Thanks"
3,"Many Rear Wheel Problems, but great when it works","I purchased the mx650 just before Christmas (for 9 yr old) and Razor has replaced the rear wheel 5 times since. The issue is the gear mechanism inside the rear wheel. Essentially the gear breaks, if you turn the throttle, the chain spins, but does not engage wheel so sits in place. As frustrating as the problem has been I must say Razor has been good about sending me new wheels each time. In just under 6 months of ownership, rear wheel has gone out 5 times with 2 or 3 of these after the 90 day warranty. The last wheel I put on only lasted 2 days!! Razor sent me a shipping label and had the wheel sent back for ""research"". Same issue has occurred to others in the neighborhood but not at same frequency as I have had. When the bike is working, it's great....bike is fast and my boy loves it."
3,2nd Bike & Back Wheel Broke Again!,"This is the 2nd bike we ordered - 1st was an MX500 for my 10 year old and this one for my older son. I can't believe that on both bikes the back wheel broke almost immediately. The part that holds the chain broke off on both bikes. Razor sent out a replacement but having to call for a part within the first week of having it is unbelievable, especially considering the price! We have also discovered that this happened to a friend of ours also. Razor needs to fix this defectRazor MX650 Dirt Rocket Electric Motocross Bikebefore they continue to ship these out."
2,Fun but not dependable,I bought this bike for my 9 year old daughter and she loved it for the four weeks it worked. After that she reported that the rear wheel was making noise and I could hear a grinding when she coasted on the bike. After a few days a bearing went out and the rear wheel would not engage at all so it was useless. I called to get a replacement part and they suggested I spray some WD-40 on it and try again. THis did nothing and they said I needed a new rear wheel assembly which is covered by the warranty but has been on backorder for two weeks. I noticed they have a service bulletin on their website for this problem so obviously it was a design flaw and they said the new part is different. I am now worried that my kid will be to big to ride by the time they send me the part. Also they said there is nothing more they will do for me except let me wait.
1,Son had it for 2 weeks and the Rear Sprocket has gone out,"Bought this MX650 for my son 9th Birthday what a big mistake. The rear wheel assembly has gone out on it, chain keeps popping off. Called Razor got a replacement wheel assembly this past Friday. ran good for 2 days chain popped off after I put the chain back on all it does is spin the rear sprocket. I WANT MY MONEY BACK."
1,MX 650 RAZOR DIRT BIKE,"I should have listen to the previous owners who wrote reviews on this product. I even warned my son before purchasing this dirt bike. It's truely a China made piece of crap with a 30 day warrenty! You will be lucky if it last 3 days. In two hours of operation have had to change the rear wheel assemble 3 things. Do not waste your money, buy yourself a real dirt bike that really works. Razor does not stand behind their products, Razor will not take it back, Razor says,""Sorry We Can Not Help You"". It's truely a Chinese piece of crap!"
5,Good times,"I was nervous ording this online, but assembly was very easy. Directions were very user friendly. Sturdy enough for up to 200 lbs. We are all having a blast.Thinking of getting another."
3,Good Bike but was difficult to assemble,"Had this bike for about a month now. It works great and very good battery life. My 13 year old uses it almost every day .My only negative is I found it very difficult to mount front tire through axel; it woulnd not align properly. Wound up loosening the front brake , then the disk brake fell apart. I finally got it all back together but it took many hours and a few slugs with a hammer to get it through. It should have been a lot easier. Minor comment; the bike came with a small crack in the plastic gear changer on the handlebar. So great to operate. Bad to assemble (at least for me)."
5,Father of the Year,"My son thinks that I am Father of the Year for buying him this bike for his birthday. It has exceeded my expectations. Easy to assemble, easy to ride. My 9-year-old handles it well. It even carries my 195 lb. body around. I requested 5-9 day shipping and it arrived in 2 days. This is a great product so far."
3,Other reviewers wrote review without using product for a long time,"The Mx650 bike is nice for a few weeks. The battery, despite following all precautions such as parking in a heated basement, having the charger connected to power through a APC voltage regulator, died after only two months of use. The replacement battery with charger cost $ 157. Replacing the battery is real pain, takes at least 2+ hours since the nuts & bolts are very awkwardly placed, leaving little or no room to get any standard tools to unscrew the bolts. Also a mixture of both metric and SAE sizes are used. The charger died after a further 2 months use necessitating the purchase of another charger. Fortunately I had a multimeter to test the charger.Most of the reviewers here have written the reviews after a few days of use. I would not recommend this product. Even buying a warranty won't help as the warranty won't cover the batteries."
2,Not a dirt bike,"We bought this for our 11 year old son to enjoy going around the field near our house. It has several good qualities - the battery lasts a long time, it is easy to assemble, my son really enjoyed it - however after a few days it suddenly stopped working. The chain went round but did not turn the back wheel. It turned out that the gear inside the wheel had broken. After a lot of negotiation, amazon agreed to replace it, but within less than two weeks exactly the same thing Happened. This bike is not as robust as it looks."
3,mx650 rear hub problems,"my son loves this mx650 when it works...it has good batteries and is easy to ride. the problem we have is that the rear wheel internal parts keep failing. when this happens the chain and sprocket spins but the wheel doesnt. we are on our 3rd rear wheel in only 3 weeks. they are being covered under warranty but what a pain. this bike is rated for someone up to 180lbs. my son is 65lbs and this shouldnt be happening. it also came out of the box with only 1 front wheel spacer which is allowed for in the instructions, however you need 2 or the wheel could wobble. i called customer service and they sent me another one.i think these companies try to save money by having everything made in china at the lowest cost sometimes sacrificing quality."
3,MX650 died on day 3.,"Well i figured i would help someone by writing this. Purchased on the 15th and assembled easily, charged 24 hours. My Son, who's 10 and small rode it on the driveway and back yard but on low grass seemed to go too slow, so he stayed on the hardtop.On the third morning 19th 10am he wakes up does a lap, stops and tries to start again, the rear wheel will not engage, it just spins.I read somewhere before that this happens to this bike and the MX500. So i blame myself somewhat.Alex"
1,Broken one week after Bday present given,"I bought the razor 650 for my son's 8th Birthday, and it was great for ONE week when the rear wheel stopped working. Apparently after some research there is a problem with the rear wheel assembly on the Razor's and after some calls Razor stated they would have it fixed after I drive it an hour away to the nearest dealer. I figured at least they are standing behind product and fixing it. I called the dealer the next day and found out the rear wheel assembly is on BACKORDER for at least a month and they know the REAR WHEEL ASSEMBLY is FAULTYRazor MX650 Dirt Rocket Electric Motocross Bike?? I will be returning mine to the store I bought it and buying a gas powered Honda !! Heck of a Birthday Gift !!!"
1,broken bike & heart,"My son was thrilled with this. ""This is freedom in a gift."" However, a critical sprocket made out of flimsy material, broke. We tried to fix but kept breaking. Really poor design. My son is heartbroken. Got for Christmas last year and only got to ride it 5 times."
1,Dont Waste Your Money,Operated 4 times since Christmas -Battery is gone / dead !! Battery cost $119.00 plus shippingRazor Customer service sucks!!Should have known better when the first unit arrived with a bent frame!!
1,Should have believed the bad reviews,We own 2 Razor 350 dirt bikes and they have been great. My oldest son outgrew the 350 so we decided to try the 650. The first day out we noticed noise from the back of the bike. I adjusted and oiled everything I could get to around the back wheel. I contacted Razor and they said they would send me a new back wheel assembly because it was all one piece. The part is on back order for at least 5 weeks with no confirmed delivery date. Within a few days the flywheel finally broke under very light street riding. I was very worried I just lost $400. Luckily Amazon was great. They immediately sent me a return shipping label and even reimbursed me the $60 to have the bike boxed at UPS. The bike would have been great if not for the defective rear wheel.
1,needs improvement ASAP,this cheap thing's battery overheated and died so it wouldn't actually ride.a couple weeks later i bought a Kawasaki kx65 which is actually good. spend the extra money and get a better bike.
5,Lots of fun !,"Bought this as a birthday present in January for 10 yr. old daughter. Assembly was easy and fast. Battery life is long, just follow charging guidelines. I suggest a full faced moto x helmet as it moves rather fast."
5,awsome,the shipping was great and all youn had to do was put on the front wheel it only took a few minutes i think this was a great buy i love my mx650
1,Why would anybody buy this?,"OK, this may seem like a fun toy for your kids, but 17 mph? And $400??? I paid $175 for my dirt bike (1979 Yamaha GTMX) and I can go really fast, jump, ride trails, burnouts, and all the things kids want to do. Don't waste your time or money buying an electric dirt bike, gas has so much more power, and if you think your kid can't handle it, they can. Go on craigslist and get them a used 50cc dirt bike, they have speed limiters on some, they will have way more fun, and its cheaper if you find the right one, plus they won't break every 5 seconds, and to all you over protective moms, save time, money, and make your kid happy by getting a real dirt bike, heck even a goped is better (again, used off craigslist) I used my friends when I was like 12 and had fun for about 5 minutes then wanted it to be faster, please people just don't buy this"
1,Don't Buy,Don't buy any Razor products except for their original scooter. Their customer service is non existent. If they believed in their products you would be able to buy and return them at a retail store like any other product. You would not have to sign off that you will not return it to the store. After the success of their original scooter they took their brand name and tried to squeeze every bit of profit out of it that they could. Razor does not mean quality to the many people screwed by their products.I would not be surprised if all of the positive feedback for this product was written buy Razor employees themselves.
3,Small electric mororcycle for a child,"I am disabled, and bought this item to get around. Nothing in the description states it is a childs's toy. The weight limit of 220 lbs. led me to believe an adult could ride it. Nothing of the sort. It is built for someone with the stature of a small child, no greater than 4 feet tall. Why you would put a child on a 100 lb. electric motorcycle that can go 17 mph is a mystery. Needless to say, I am returning the item."
3,Hummmm?,"The recording wasn't very good I found the music to be distant never engaging, But matrerial has much promise -maybe another recording or label might bring out the best ?"
4,Pretty good but not great,"If you watch the show on even a semi-regular basis then you probably don't need to buy this book. If not, then Nanny 911 is pretty good. Some of the advice seems to fall into the ""intuitively obvious"" category to me but, then again, there are some pretty stupid people out there replicating themselves...Overall, it's a decent 101 lesson on communication and relating to children without spoiling them or invalidating their feelings. Basically, their wisdom boils down to respect and consistency. Again, fairly obvious stuff. Even so, I found several useful tips that I will defiantly keep in mind and apply.Recommended."
2,nanny 911,"I bought this book a few months back and i have found it really disappointing, it doesn't say anything new to the TV show and i was unimpressed with it's lack of content.I have recently bought another new nanny book called - Nanny Wisdom. By Justine Walsh and Kim Nicholson. I can already tell these nannies have really thought about the content of their book and put alot of work into it -unlike the Nanny 911 nannies."
5,Nanny 911: Expert Advice for All Your Parenting Emergencies,"This book is truly informative and should be read by everyone who has children, is associated with children or is thinking of having children. A lot of the advise is real and basic but unless you get it from the horse's mouth, you don't think about it - Common Sense. It's about teaching YOU how to work with children - train the trainer. I don't have children myself but have have nieces and nephews, and friends with little ones. After reading this I find that I'm able to help them out with issues they may be having with their kids. I've given this book to my brother-in-law who is a single dad, and I've also given it to two young couples who are expecting. A Must Read!"
5,Great Fundamentals,"As a fan of the Nanny 911 series, I was already sold on the basic premise of using consistent and loving discipline to raise children. This book describes in great detail the hows and whys of this type of parenting style.I have been using another book called Behavior Coaching by a Dr. Scott Hall and Matt Pasquinilli. Nanny 911 is a great companion book to Behavior Coaching as it offers expert tips and strategies for handling immediate emergencies like screaming and whining children. Behavior Coaching is a long term approach to improving your child's behavior using a lot of the same fundamental concepts as Nanny 911.To be a real parenting expert, or expert nanny, get Nanny 911 and Behavior Coaching and start practicing right away."
5,Must have for parents,Bought this for my daughter to give to her friend- my daughter read it first and immediately began to apply her new knowledge. I could see the difference in the children within one week. Very proud my daughter took the advise and is applying it in a positive direction.
3,Not quite what I expected.,Not organized too well. I wish the section would cover more topics too with short answers.
5,Nanny 911,"I wish nanny 911 had been around while I was raising my children. It's just wonderful being able to turn a very difficult job, caring for children into a more peaceful and respectful relationship. To be able to turn a frantic situation around is quite an art. This book helps me to turn around problems that arise in my daycare. Also helps to take the frustration and replace it with confidence in meeting the situation head on."
1,Just the show in book form!,"I thought this would be filled with great tips and such but it is only the show in book form, word for word. Waste of money"
1,PUhlease....,"This is a dumb machine...DVD will be HD soon so who cares. Why do I want to fast forward, rewind, not have features just so I can be the only guy in a 300 mile radius who own one of these things? You would have to be a big gadget guy with big pockets to buy something that was obsolete in the drawing room..."
4,HD Tape vs. DVD,"I have one of these units (I've had a D-VHS since 1998, although not capable of recording HD). I have to say that the amazing quality of the D-VHS format is wonderful. The argument that HD-DVDs are coming soon is a powerful one: despite what one review here says, D-VHS tapes *DO* degrade over time, like any other tape format. The bad thing with digital is that once the oxides flake off the tape, the picture is unwatchable, not just fuzzy like analog. That said, it will be a long time before HD-DVD can record off air like this VCR does; it's unlikely that today's HD programming will be available soon on DVD, so recording off the air is the only option for preserving these first HD programs. And the fact that you can tape dozens of hours of programming on one tape is wonderful for those of us who travel - a great alternative to the PVR with no extra monthly fees."
1,No FireWire comm with computer,"I bought this VCR for Hi-Def video editing (export HD footage to D-VHS tape) and as DV backup storage (store several miniDV tape contents to one DVHS tape).In both applications this deck fails miserably. It just doesn't talk to the computer via FireWire, noway. JVC tech support didn't help one single bit - all they said was ""it's a driver issue"", but they don't release the driver for their device...In short, if you just want a VCR that may take input from a camcorder through FireWire - maybe it's OK. If you want to output video from your computer (from Adobe Premiere, Ulead MediaSturdio Pro or VideoStudio, Microsoft Windows Movie Maker) - just forget it. Doesn't work at all. I can't express my disappointment strongly enough."
5,Powerful even for this believer,I watched this dvd is one setting....I have often been told by my pastor to look for Jesus all around you....this series is the first to give me a glimpse into what he means when he says all around you. Bravo to all involved in this serie....I can only imagine where this show could have went....I hope the creator decide to write a book for those of us who want to know what happens to all the characters...then again isn't that kind of what religion is about...
4,What a Shame it was canned !!!!,Loved it !!!!!!!!Real Life situations !!!!!Dayum they cancelled a sure winner here !!!!I watched the whole thing in one go !!!
1,Book of Daniel is outrageous,"NBC should be ashamed of itself for presenting this junk. Oh, yes, liberals like to make fun of Christians. Some say it is a comedy and should not be taken seriously, just lighten up. Well, NBC would not think of doing a similar program about any other religion or group, not in this politically- correct era. NBC should be ashamed of even releasing this junk on DVD. I imagine they are at the bottom of the barrel."
5,The networks have done themselves a great dis-service by cancelling this show,"This show is amazing. It made be bawl, not cry - bawl, it made me laugh, and it made me think. I agree with much of the other posts here and I don't have much to add to them except for this: I don't understand how the ""God Warrior"" from Trading Spouses seems less offensive to anyone in the religious community than the real life controversies of this show. The Book of Daniel was written with so much thought and feeling. Yet, shows like Trading Spouses and the like, making Christians look like idiots, goes on and inspirational shows with so much talent like The Book of Daniel are cancelled. I'm at a loss."
5,FINALLY someone came to their senses!!!,"Elated would be an understatement as to how I feel about this show being available for purchase on DVD. This was THE only quality television show available to watch before it was cancelled (and we all know why...low ratings my %$#%@). I urge EVERYONE to buy it and hopefully the interest will spark Showtime or HBO to pick it up and run with it!! This show is not only funny, but warm, thought provoking, and incredibly acted by all the actors especially by Aidan Quinn. BRAVO!!"
3,dvd,I remember watching this on tv and was sad when it no longer aired. I ordered one earlier in the year and the 2nd disc was very distorted. Amazon was great in giving me a refund. I decided to order another hoping this would be fine. The 2nd disc was bad also but I had already thrown out the original package so I kept it.This was a great price and looked factory sealed.
5,AWESOME SERIES. NO ONE IS PERFECT EXCEPT GOD!!!!,"I love this series because it shows human beings as humans not as 'gods' which we definitely are not. Priests and ministers are not 'gods' although many would like them to be. I'm a Christian and all the foibles shown in this series are the reality of human life. To paraphrase what Father Webster said in one of his sermons, ""temptation is a reality, don't be so disturbed because you sometimes give in to it. If you didn't then there would be no need for redemption! ""If you cannot handle the fact no one is perfect except GOD then the sooner you cross over the better. Then all will see as we do not see now. Great characters, great cast and more troubles than any one family should ever have to face. Aidan Quinn is wonderful as Father Webster."
4,Book of Daniel DVD,"Excellent viewing. The series combines humor, pathos, creative plot, and very fine acting. Highly recommend, although some may certain portions of the story to be offensive."
4,Book of Daniel - Great Show,"This is a great show and I wish it had an opportunity to remain on the show. The package includes 2 DVD with very little fluff, there is not any real bonus material. But if you are a fan of the show, this is great."
5,BBall,As advertised - nice system for the money and I am happy with the quality and price of unit. Yes
2,Great until the rust starts to appear,"My kids loved this when we got it. It is sturdy, but I have to agree with the other reviewer about the rust. We have had it 2 years and need to replace it as rust dripping all down our pool!"
4,Nice pool basketball goal,"This basketball goal is a good value for the money and the kids have enjoyed it. The portability is a good feature, and it designed well for its intended use. I researched all possible choices for pool basketball goals from very expensive to the inexpensive, and I am happy with this one. A downside is that it must be anchored into the concrete to prevent it from being pulled over by dunking which could cause an injury. I did not want to drill into my new pool deck, so taking a chance here. Assembly was easy and took about 1 hour."
5,Hubby loves it,"I bought this as a birthday surprise for my husband. After putting it easily together , he has used it at least daily during his afternoon swim."
2,Call me Rusty!,I have had the basketball hoop for a few Summers now and am encountering the same RUST issues as other purchasers. For the price I would not reccomend this item becuase of the rust. The oeverall design and construction is decent but now that the rust has started it is a mess... What began as a happy purchase is now turning into a very negative purchase.
4,Good Hoop but shop for price,"Bought this hoop for my high school son. I wouldn't recommend it for younger kids with a built in pool unless they are phenomenal at treading water. It's great for teens and olderInstallation will take 2 persons, possibly a third to attach the rim. The instructions are misleading. I contacted the manufacturer about the ""middle"" pole referenced multiple times in the instructions. They told me the instructions were wrong and that there wasn't a middle pole with this system.Most importantly, shop around for price. I found it for $80 dollars less directly from the manufacturer. Amazon doesn't match price and I was too lazy to disassemble and return it. Today I see it has been reduced on Amazon by $40 bucks since I purchased it last month."
3,Okay for a few years,"First of all, excellent basketball net. Qaulity great. Looks great by the pool (when new). Secondly, great service by Lifetime, after a few years I complained about rusting, they replaced it without problems.I think the problem is my salt pool and the damage salt can do to all metal near the pool. Our first one lasted 2 years, and literally, started to disintegrate. When replaced, the second one only lasted a year.Lifetime recommends that you rinse the product off with fresh water after each use, but c'mon, can we expect 12 year old kids to comply.If you are looking for a great basketball net, and realize it will have to be replaced every 1-2 years, you are okay with this product. If you are prepared to rinse off after use, and maybe touch up rust spots with rust paint as they develop, you may get more years out of the product."
1,Missing hardware pieces and cant assemble,"Received item and it came with multiple bags of bolts, nuts, washers and brackets. Started putting together and notice important bolts and nuts where missing but since i have a bucket of extra bolts/nuts in garage no big deal. Then realized after trying to put wheels on bottom of pole the connecting steel rods where missing and all of that hardware which i could not just substitute from my spare pieces. Basketball hoop now sits half assembled and useless. Thanks lifetime for not inventorying what you shipped out and costing me hours of sweat and aggravation."
2,Rust Monster!,"Loved it, but then the rust started. Started rusting the first year and I seem to have a permanent stain. Would not recommend."
5,A wonderful American Sisters book!,"This book was almost as good as the first American Sisters book, WEST ALONG THE WAGON ROAD, and was even better than the wonderful A TITANIC JOURNEY ACROSS THE SEA. This book tells of the Garrett family: ten year old Hannah, her twelve year old sister Abigail, and their father and stepmother, and the voyage they make from England to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630 to escape religious persecution. This was an exciting, historically accurate story of the hardships and dangers people braved to colonize the New World in the 17th century. I can't wait to read the next two books in this series, ADVENTURE ON THE WILDERNESS ROAD and CROSSING THE COLORADO ROCKIES. Congratulations to Laurie Lawlor for the great job she did on this series. Fans of Dear America and American Diaries are sure to love American Sisters."
3,"ok, but expensive","Not great quality for the money and a tad smaller than I expected. Packing wasn't great as the two sliding doors on front were sitting on top of the bench (must insert them yourself) and not covered in cardboard other than the lid of the outside box. So one of the doors were indented. The bottom rail of the bench also had a crack in the wood. It's decently made and looks decent, but not high quality wood or finish. Product should be priced closer to $100, not $300."
5,"Latin rhythms, dance classics, and even Caribbean music","This new exercise DVD is by multi-certified nutritionist and fitness trainer Jeanette Jenkins, known for her professional appearances on NBC's Today Show and Fox News World among other venues, and is an excellent enhancement to any workout program. ""Jeanette Jenkins: The Hollywood Trainer - Cardio Dance"" is a vigorous and enthusiastic workout applying 40 minutes of Latin rhythms, dance classics, and even Caribbean music, followed by 20 minutes of dancer's sculpting to stretch and tone abs, legs, and arms. A fun and high-spirited way to liven up one's fitness routine, highly recommended."
5,"A good teenager book reviewed by Ashley, age 15","I liked CHANGING FACES a lot. I definitely give it 5 stars. It's a good teenager book. It holds your interest. I liked it because I like the make-over TV shows, but in CHANGING FACES Olivia realizes she needs more than a physical make-over. She needs a spiritual make-over too."
5,Changing Faces,"This first book of Wendy Lawton's Real TV series is delightful. Through Olivia's personal journey, the reader is reminded of the things that are really important. As Olivia pulls out all the stops to achieve her lifetimg goal of becoming valedictorian of her high school, her discovery of what it means to serve others is exciting. As she works at a homeless shelter, ""those people"" become her dear friends as we see them unite to work on a shelter project. And although Olivia receives a makeover on the outside, she realizes that it was her own attitudes that needed the makeover all along. Don't miss this great read!"
4,"So much to do, so little time","Olivia O'Donnell's senior year hasn't started off too well. On the first day of school she finds herself in a three-way tie for valedictorian and needs to come up with a volunteer position to give herself an edge over the competition. As she schedules volunteer time in her already over-crowded day planner, other things get crowded out-family, friends, homework. But an unexpected stint on a makeover show gets her to thinking about others, especially those women trying to start a new life in the shelter. Olivia learns about what is really important in life and uses that knowledge to help out others.This is a book I will encourage my daughter to read."
5,Works Great!!!,I don't know where you stored yours but mine lasted long enough to be used and never leaked at all.
5,bought for work,All the pots were broken at work. I reach the coffee maker and found the right pots. boy that abuse from my co workers. I will buy these pots again. that's a promise.
3,Picture is decieving.,"The picture shows 2, but you only get one. I was disappointed. It is glass, and it is a nice pot, but if you are looking for 2 like is shown in the picture, look for others."
3,It is okay.,My Daughter is five years old. She is excited about the Doodle Bear. I was not impressed with the stenciling machine nor the awkward templates that come with it. However the five year old is content. I would rate it okay.
1,Federal Warning!!!!!,"We are aware that bootleg CDs/DVDs are being posted onto Amazon along with fake reviews by possible leads into a further investigation.Beware of the names that give 5 star, short-worded raving reviews regarding items that cannot be verified as legitimate CDs/DVDs.The investigation into these releases and their sellers are being headed up by Federal officials and all of Amazon will be notified of all parties involved in order to remove illegal content."
2,Horribly edited,"Who edited this book? It is full of errors in text and language. Repeated sentences, misplaced words, and messed up text make it hard to take the author seriously."
5,Absolutely Riveting,"This book was so riveting from beginning to end - it was impossible to put down!! How a vibrant young woman's life could change so drastically was amazing and frightening. The true story of a successful professional with so much promise ahead of her, only to be betrayed by the man she loved and the doctors that were supposed to help her brought so much emotion to the book - it had me holding my breath with each chapter. Yet the tenacity and determination of Alesandra in the midst of chaos and terrible illness was so encouraging and a testament to the strength of the human spirit!!""Deeds of Trust"" reminded me to always fight the good fight for what is right and true! I thank you for sharing your victory over incredibly difficult odds and your ever positive spirit. It redefines the concept of hope and new beginnings. Your tirelessefforts to help others after your own adversity is beyond commendable, it is heroic! This book is absolutely inspiring and a MUST read. Bravo, Alesandra!"
3,A Rare and Compelling Glimpse at a Culture,"The Birth to Five Book: Confident Childrearing Right from the StartThe ancient people of Nias and the surrounding cultures makes for an interesting, unusual read. I'm amazed at the author's tenacity and patience in the face of so much frustration. This is a clean book, no vulgarities or sexual scenes, so it's a safe, informative geographic book for kids."
3,Interesting Book,It has been a life saviour and taught me to write a Business Plan in a very easy and lucid manner.
2,"Hard to Install, No Help with Instruction","Hangdango Game Suite is a handful of games that resembles inexpensive games, including freeware. It was hard to install, and the instructions did not help, and customer service was almost nonexistent. Not what I expected."
1,Then There Were Three,"One of a terrible low budget double bill of war stories. My one star rating is here only to get this evaluation published. It's actually a ""no rater"". I bought it only because I had met one of the actors in my father's elderly hotel. Nice title, though."
3,"Pretty good value; chrome is rusting after 1 month, still works","It really does a great job of picking up pet hair. The only observation that I can make that I think would improve the product is a longer cord, but I bought it knowing I'd be using an extension cord. The canister holds quite a bit and the suction power is decent, especially for the pet hair. The only complaint is that I've only had it a month and the chrome extension piece is already starting to rust. Directions are a bit difficult to understand in terms of changing out the different attachments."
1,If only there were a rating of ZERO Stars,"That would be my choice for this product. Worst thing I have spent money on in a very long time. The brush roller does not rotate, and it does not pick up even the smallest bit of fuzz. With a Lab and a Rotti dog that sheds enough to clothe a small village, I need a vacuum that actually does what it claims it will do. If you are in the same kennel as I, please do not waste your money on this item."
2,wouldn't buy it again,"The first one I bought had a faulty cord. It wouldn't stay out and kept trying to wind up. After a quick exchange at Target I realized that the cord is way too short. I am constantly unplugging it and trying to find a closer outlet. Now, less than a year later my hose just snapped! A replacement hose will cost me over $20 becuase it only comes in a pack with the tube. I think I will just throw it in storage for now. Not worth spending more money."
3,Abi,Hey just thought I would help out those with problems returning their vacuum to the Target store... if the product has been kept past 90 days Target will not authorize the return and will advise you to the warranty info... If you do not have the receipt Target's policy does make you exchange it for something of equal or greater value in the same department (vacuums) it does not have to be this particular item though. If you do have the receipt and the product is used Target will return it if it is defective ... other then that Target will not authorize a product that has been simply used and then returned (helps so you do not go and buy someone elses used vacuum). Hope that helped a little.. I'm looking forward to buying this vacuum so thank you for the positive/negetive feedback! *This info comes straight from the source.. I worked there a couple years while in school*
1,Avoid this at all costs,"It doesn't suck! It doesn't suck! All I want is a vacuum cleaner that uses a vacuum to suck dirt up to make my place clean. Sounds simple. I took it out of the box, plugged it in, aimed it at my hardwood floor. Lots of noise, no suction. Switched attachments and headed for my carpeted stairs, same problem. Total time: 5 minutes, tops. So I packed it up in the box and went back to Target. THEY WOULDN'T TAKE IT BACK SINCE I OPENED THE BOX! Duh, how do you find out a product doesn't work if you don't try it? Call a psychic?? You'll get more enjoyment if you just burn $100. I now have $100 worth of plastic in a box in my basement. And I still need a new vacuum cleaner."
4,great little machine!,"I don't get all the negative reviews at all, this little vacuum is really strong, great on BOTH hard floors and carpets, the attachments are ideal. The only reason it ddn't get 5 stars from me is because the cord is way too short - you have to change plugs to vacuum a larger area or use an extension cable.For $99, it's a bargain. More powerful than any vacuum I've had before, and you can see how much dirt you're picking up which is very satisfying."
2,Worked great for the first year...,"I had a Shark roadster Vacuum and it worked great for the first year of owning it. This fall, it was just about 1 year to the exact date of purchase, my Shark Roadster quit working. I am now left with a vacuum that won't even turn on. The only thing I can do is throw it away and buy new because it was purchased from Target more than 90 days ago and I no longer have the receipt. From my experience, the Shark Roadster is not dependable. I hope your experience is better..."
1,Not worth the money,"We had a Dirt Devil that lasted over 10 years. It was great. This unit is a poor performer compared to the old $50 Dirt Devil. It doesn't pick up dirt well(has poor suction.) The filters are expensive to replace and they must be replaced. Just because it is bagless doesn't mean it does not have filters. The HEPA filter needs to be changed (or delicately cleaned) ever 10 or so uses or it plugs up.Oh, and ours lasted a grand total of 4 months before the motor died. Check the warranty!"
1,Waste of money,"As another customer noted this is no good for carpets. I have a lot of laminate flooring and it does a great job,but only for 5 minutes of sweep time. After that it is over heated and automatically shuts off then I must wait atleast an hour before I can do another 5 minutes of sweeping. How frustrating!"
4,I loved this vacuum,"I don't know why everyone is saying this vacuum shuts off after 5 minutes. I have never had that happen with mine. compared to our upright vacuum, this vacuum was wonderful! It sucked up stuff our other vacuums wouldn't. My only complaint is, I lost a part to it and there doesn't seem to be a replacement for it so now I can't use it anymore."
1,Terrible,"I purchased two different shark products. Both of them quit working after a couple of months. I thought maybe it was something I did wrong with the first one so I got the second.I used the product just like the manual said. It kept overheating and is now emiting sparks inside by the motor(don't think it's supposed to do that). I loved it when I first bought it, but will not buy another."
1,Shark Roadster,"DON'T BUY THIS VACUUM!!! I had it less than 3 months before it stopped working. I took it to a vacuum repair place and they changed the belt (it had broken) but it still doesn't work. Like the other reviews say, it shuts itself off after 5 minutes and doesn't pick up anything in the canister!"
1,Shark Roadster,"This is the crappiest vacuum cleaner I have ever bought! It turns off by itself, clogs on the bottom, just carpet fibers of all things, without even reaching the cup. I've cleaned it, cleaned the hoses, checked the belt, everything, it works sometimes, and within 5 minutes it turns off, like if it's over heating and clogging. Where can I complain to the company at?"
1,Worst vacuum I've ever owned,"This vacuum is horrible. The filters constantly clog. The smallest amount of dirt in the cup cuts down the sunction incredibly. No floor brush is included and the hose and cord are both too short. I don't know what it was designed for, but certainly not for effortless vacuuming."
1,Agreed with previous reviews,"I don't think it needs much more reviews but I thought I'd contribute. I probably bought before there was any review yet and now I wished there had been. It does look like junk, the power chord is way too short, you cannot adjust the power, you can only lift it from the rear which feels odd, it's not very ergonomic and the accessories are all over the place. Anyway, now I know that bagless should be the way to go and I'll make sure I'll choose right next time. I'll keep this one for the attic..."
3,Does the job,I got mine to clean around my bird cage. It has good suction and gets the food and feathers out of the carpet. I do have to clean the filters every two uses. But I've never had a problem with over heating.
1,Shark Roadster Bagless Canister Vacuum,"I started out loving this vacuum, loving the powerful suction, however, like most of these reviews, the problem with overheating is a bit much. Where it should take 45 minutes to vacuum, it takes almost three hours because you have to let it cool off. And yes, I have cleaned the filters, all three of them and it works one time and the next time it shuts off after approximately 15 minutes of use. Save your money and buy something else."
1,"worst vacuum, customer service non-existent!","I got this Shark Power Pet Cannister Vac to vacuum up cat hair from my wood floors and area rugs. I will say, at first this vacuum did a great job. Now it's two and a half years later and this thing is nothing more than a sound machine. I only have one short haired cat and she really doesn't shed that much, especially living in california. So this vacuum, specifically designed to pick up pet hair, shouldn't have a problem vacuuming up her hair. It doesn't vacuum up anything, it runs at a really high pitch, and then it shuts itself off because it gets too hot. I have changed the filter on this thing and it didn't improve the situation. I have sent an email to the company and no response. I would not recommend buying this vacuum or any other product from this company, as its customer service is non-existent."
4,I found replacement filters!!!!!,"To Carol in Federal Way - go to www.sharkcompany.com. You'll find the replacement filters there at a reasonable price. I agree with your review. I like this vacuum. I have several and this one seems to pick up the most. Granted the container is small (for a house with kids and pets) but for the price, the easy to stow size, it is worth it for those with wood floors. Can't advise on the carpet action as I don't have any."
3,Good --not great,I bought my Roadster 2 1/2 years ago. Initally it was great. I especially liked the velveteen strip that rolled up the dog hair out of the area rugs. I didn't like the incredibly short cord. I use an industrial power cord so I don't have to keep changing plug in locations. Mostly I have hardwoods and it did okay. Recently the wheel clips started breaking off and now one is completely off. The stair cleaning attachment fell completely apart the other day even though it was seldom used. The filters need replacing as does the wheel. Finding an online resource is proving close to impossible. I'm looking for a new vacuum now. And guess what--the new one won't be a Shark!
1,What a piece of junk!,No power in the head - it turns because air blows through it. If your carpet is anything but totally flat carpet this vaccuum will be absolutely useless.
4,Great vacuum! Works just fine!,"Very powerful for its size. I bet previous reviewers confused Roadster Bagless Canister machine with its smaller relative which is not bagless. Like I said it's powerful, lightweight. It does not require to change filters like previous reviewer said. It's good on picking up dirt off carpets and hard floors. Works like charm for 2 months straight and our family loves this little devil. :)"
4,Vrrroooommm!,"Just got home from Target, and couldn't wait to plug in my new roadster... Pulled the canister out of the box, and attached the hoses,<br />plugged into electricity and vroom, off I went... Zipping across my wood floors and sucking up anything and everything in my path with a huge smile spreading across my face. Cleaning isn't my favorite thing to do, but with a vacuum as nifty and zippy as this, and excellent suckage, it sure doesn't hurt like it used to... I used to be afraid of sharks, but this is one great white that I love to play with... ; )"
1,If you have carpet or pets do not buy this vacuum,I bought the roadster because of the power nozzle since I have carpet and a dog. It is the worst vacuum I have ever owned. I clean out the filter several times while I am sweeping and wash it after every use and it still barely picks up anything. If you want a canister vacuum with a power nozzle you are better off spending the extra money and buy a real quality vacuum. I wrote to the company and told them how disappointed I was with their vacuum and have yet to hear from them. It is nice to know they stand behind their product.
1,Big disappointment,"It had a lot of power and great pickup, but my Shark Roadster worked for less than five minutes before it turned off because the motor overheated. It's a shame because the cleaner has a lot of great features -- attachments, shoulder strap, etc. -- but that does no good if it won't run. Needless to say, I returned it the next day."
1,Don't buy this one!,"While the Shark Roadster has adequate suction and is light to carry around, it is impossible to replace the HEPA filter in the machine. Replacement parts are simply unavailable. (Target sends you to the company website; the company website tells you to call the 800 number, and the 800 number is always--and I mean always--busy.) In other words, after six months, all you can do with the machine is throw it out and buy something else."
1,Not Recommended,Cord doesn't stay out. Filters need to be cleaned after every use. The cannister fills up quickly. Only pros are the price and it is very lightweight. Only okay on hard floors and does a terrible job on carpets. Doesn't pick up small food items (ie. cheerios or cherrio pieces). I wouldn't ever buy this vacuum again.
3,8 bucks worth,"i paid 8 bucks for it, it was only worth that.poorly made. cheapest plastic u will find.speaker itself work, but (obviously) not at the best.does high tones somewhat well, goin above 120 watts it will make white noise.i didnt want to spent anythin above $20 for my first test tweeter.it definitely did wat it was meant to do (for $8) and not a single increment more."
3,Scottish Flag,"Price and service were both good. You get what you pay for, as this flag was no of high quality."
1,Blatantly used and broken,"Timer did not work. Item showed obvious wear, as if it were used and returned prior. Very disappointed in purchase. Cost almost makes it more trouble than it is worth to return. Picked one up (another brand) at local Lowes and it works fine."
3,This thing works but not what I need,"Basically this thing give you two sets of plug-in, one set controlled by the timer, another one not. So you will have one set always on. It's not the application I want, I needed two sets both controlled by timers, for example, at night I need one set powered on; at day I need it off but another set on."
1,Nonfunctioning on arrival,"I'd have to add my vote to those who received a dud - the timer on my power strip never did work, though it took nearly a week of cold slow cookers (we use a timer to start ours while we are at work) to figure out exactly why. Reason? The actual timer dial wasn't turning to keep the time.I realize I could probably return this for one that does work (by now, too much hassle.. I've thrown away the packaging), but given the number of similar reviews, would say this also speaks to the overall quality of the product."
3,works... sort of,Turns stuff on and off but timer loses a few minutes each day which adds up over a week+.
4,Good but a little expensive,Bought two of these: one for a turtle tank and one for an aquarium. They work fantastically at what they are designed for. They allow me to have the filters and heaters always on and the lights timed. The timers are precise. Saw a similar type product though in my local grocery store for a third of the price so shop around. Overall I am pleased with this item and it's given me no problems in 6 months.
1,Piece of junk!,"In spite of some of the negative reviews, I decided to take a chance on this. Right out of the box the timer lost time, but after a couple of weeks now it loses over an hour a day, sometimes much more than that. Don't waste your money. I plan to return it."
3,Worked for a while,"I bought this for the timer section. It worked quite well for a while but after a couple months, the timer section stopped working. Not sure why this happened. I have just been using it as a regular power strip now."
1,Watch Me Grow,I was not happy with the pictures in this book. I was purchasing the book for a new mother and the pictures were dark and seemed blurry to me. I ended up returning the book and purchasing a different one.
4,Great for expecting mom,This was a great book because it had a simple one page explanation of baby's milestones and showed great ultrasound pics of the baby as it developed. I really enjoyed reading it with my husband each week and seeing the progress of our baby's development. It was one of those easy to read books that will keep your significant others attention!
4,Bought this for our four year old,"We are expecting our third child in four years and really purchased it for our four-year-old to ""watch"" his brother (or sister) grow both from my ever-increasing stomach and ""peeking"" inside using this book. When he was three we took him to see his brother on ""TV"" (ultrasound) and he loved it so with this pregnancy he was ready for a little more involvement and interaction. He likes to see what his little brother/sister is up to every week inside Mommy and has something to talk about to my navel which has turned into the baby megaphone. Great pictures and information for any age but also for small children."
5,Informative Read for the mom-to-be,I have purchased this book for both my daughter and daughter-in-law. It gives a wonderful description of the weekly growth and development of a fetus. The photography is incredible.
1,"Good idea, lazy execution","The main appeal of alternate history is the contrast between our known world and what might have been in whatever hypothetical scenario the author envisions. ""The Alteration"" by Kingsley Amis engagingly suggested a credible world where the Reformation had never taken place, and Robert Harris' ""Fatherland"" did the same for a Nazi victory. These and other successful alternative histories work because of the detail of the imagined world. ""Romanitas"" is really a potboiler airport thriller, despite its literary pretensions. For this book to be interesting and to live up to its cover illustration and tag-line, I want to know what the vehicles and buildings look like, how Roman society has survived for 2500 years, how this imaginary geopolitical system works. All the author has done is replace greek etymology with latin (""longdictor"" instead of ""telephone"", ""birota"" for ""bicycle""), and placed a rather formulaic chase plot into a lame, half-developed setting."
1,"Nice premise, needs editing","Always an interesting idea with fiction - the alternative history setting. McDougall initially does well easing the reader into the new Rome milieu with an interesting background and enough details to pique the interest of the reader. However once the chase begins - which dominates the book, the plot and writing falters, and the nature of the characters comes through as thin and in need of firmer writing. A good editor would have made this a shorter book, with a stronger cast and the result would have been a better book, and ultimately created a greater bond of sympathy between the reader and the characters. The final pages set up the next in the series and are quite disappointing, and so I won't read the sequels, even though the premise is one I find particularly interesting"
3,Respectful 1950s style representation of Adm. Haulsey,"Movie uses critical battle for Guadalcanal as a vehicle to summarize the measured but also incredibly bold Adm. Haulsy's aggression and instincts were key to the early and decisive total destruction of Japan's Naval, Air and Land forced in the Pacific and he is frequently overlooked.Worth a watch, if only to learn a little bit about this great leader."
5,an extra dimension,"This book is mainly concerned with exactly what the title says and I have been searching for a book like this for a very long time. because for one, it provides a very detailed explanation of topics that are intersting in the realm of physics. Such as the fourth dimension. it is very visual and explains things in a way that I can understand. I also like this book because it doesn't spend half the book telling you about which scientist hated the other scientist, Or the entire biography of Dr. Planck before they tell me what the planck length is"
5,"great book, easy to understand.",This book is short and sweet. It is a very good introduction to the topics. and good to read if they aren't new to you. H(Ighly recomended.
2,"geometry, relativity and the fourth dimemsion",too abstract. Didn't touch on relativity until the 4th chapter and had trouble following the book til then.
4,"Instructive, and interesting","I found the book to be both educational, in that I learned great deal about geomtery and the history of diemsions from this book, as well as being fun to read. Both interesting and intellectually stimulating--I find this combination rare. I recommend ths book to anyone interested in the field."
2,Misleading,"I bought this book because I thought it would help me visualize (in some way) the 4th dimension. But, although the author does indeed try to do so in the first three chapters, he then starts going on about quantum mecanics (briefly), special relativity and general relativity in the ""traditional"" way: with Minkowsky diagrams (1 space dimension and 1 time dimension), so I guess the 4th dimension simply is forgotten after the three first chapters.If you are looking for books on quantum mechanics, special relativity and/or general relativity, there are much better books than this. If you are looking (as I was) for a book on geometry and the 4th dimension, than the first three chapters of this book are not bad, but are not enough..."
1,The quality of the sound of this cd is terrible.,The cd is based on old tapes or 78 records. Absolutely no effort was made to eliminate the static. Michael Spiro
5,great,Arrived promptly; works great. Love Dan Fogelberg and his songs. Very relaxing and enjoyable to listen to as I'm driving.
5,Dan Fogelberg is classic,Great album...brings back memories from my childhood. I wish there were more artists like him. I highly recommend this album.
5,"Great Fogelberg Collection, But Too Ballad-Heavy","THE VERY BEST OF DAN FOGELBERG is more complete than 1982's GREATEST HITS, but one exceptional song from the earlier collection that's missing (and IS on PLAYLIST: THE VERY BEST OF DAN FOGELBERG) is ""The Power Of Gold"", a product of Fogelberg's interest in the Allman Brothers Band's ""Ramblin' Man"" and ""Jessica"", and perhaps his best song ever. Moreover, there are a few too many ballads here. If you buy this CD, don't forget to get PLAYLIST as well."
2,2 songs from the first 4 albums?!,"i'm sorry, but my personal opinion is that his first four albums were the best of his career. to have only 2 songs represent this early stage of his career, and to call it 'the very best of dan fogelberg' is a travesty. if you are familiar with his work, you already know this. if you are new to him, and think he only wrote sappy romantic ballads, listen to his first 4 albums. that material is 'the very best of dan fogelberg', in my opinion."
5,Nice CD!!!,Great CD for a great Price. Can just recommend this one. Seller mailed it out quickly.Thanks!!!
5,A very good and complete greatest hits of a great singer !,"I'm not American, I'm Québécois, but here in Québec, we know all about your music, and all about your singers, and I can definitively tell you : Dan Fogelberg is really one of your greatest singer. He is natural, honest, upright, and he believes (and makes us believe) in what he does in his career. In this album, you can find many nice pictures of Dan, and the songs are all excellents. From ""Part of the plan"" (his first big hit in 1973) to ""A love like this"" (20 years later...) and from the inspired ""Longer"" to the marvellous ""Lonely in love"", you can discover here the best of his work. ""Believe in me"", one of my favourite song of Dan, is there too... If you don't have any record of him, this ""best of"" is a good way to start your collection. This is a great portrait of Dan Fogelberg, a very sensitive and talented man. Yes Dan, I ""Believe in you"" !"
2,Oh Well,"I guess I liked Dan Fogelberg a lot more when I used to have the LP than when I got around, just recently, to getting the CD. Yawn."
5,Excellent,"A wonderful collection of Dans finest. It's a shame this talented muscian passed away at 57 yrs old, but his music lives on. Easy ordering and arrived with in the time promised."
5,Excellent CD,"This is a fantastic collection of his greatest hits. There are 17 songs on the CD and it is truly ""feel good"" music. If you need to have your spirits up lifted, this is the CD to listen to!"
5,The very best of dan fogelberg,I very much enjoy this cd. I never knew that Dan Fogelberg had so many hits. Price was good and it came in the mail in just a couple days. Completely happy
4,It'd get 5 stars from me except,"this compilation CD does not include Dan's duet with Tim Weisberg: ""The Power of Gold"". Other than that, there's not a thing wrong here. Good job on the remastering, and all of Dan's noteable hits are here."
4,Definitely An Improvement,"This disc (released 2001) is a considerable improvement over the earlier 1980's disc. It has more songs, and includes the ones included in that earlier disc.I bought the first greatest hits collection within two years of its release, back when I was still in high school. I'm normally a jazz and R&B; listener, and the fact that I am very much into Dan Fogelberg definitely says something about how broad his appeal is. I'm certainly not the only one; don't think for one second that today's generation of hip hop artists hasn't been paying attention to what Dan Fogelberg has done in his career. The man gets much respect. He's earned it.Of course Dan is still very much a contemporary artist as well! I haven't bought ""Full Circle"" yet, but it's definitely on my music shopping list."
1,"Neat idea, but this is an awful product","This is a neat idea - we were offered a free trial by Scotch. But this is not a good product.The alleged advantage, of course, is that we can stack these on bookshelves or in the supply closet with all the other supplies. And it's true that if they are still sealed, they stack/pack nicely.But after the first use, the brick falls apart. You have to find a bag to put all the pieces in, just like you do with normal styrofoam peanuts.Further, the claim that these will ""expand 3x their volume"" is a bit misleading. It does not expand, and the shape/size of these peanuts actually makes them a bit less efficient than normal peanuts (they're too flat). Plus, in this packaging, you get 1/3 less than if you buy a bag of generic peanuts (assuming a $5 or $6 retail price for this brick).One nice thing about them - there is no static cling or foam ""dust"" with the brick. But overall, I'm unimpressed. I'm turning down any future free samples."
1,Not What I expected,"DO NOT PURCHASE IF you think these are Packing Peanuts. They aren't, they are made of Styrofoam. They do not fill spaces and go everywhere except, into the box. They are not conducive as a product for filling space to cushion and item during packing. Do not make the same mistake I did. I MAY find a use for these yet, not certain, what that could be. Waste of MY time Waste of My money."
2,Ne example problems,"In many typical introductory texts, myriad example problems are given to instruct the reader. However, this text offers virtually no examples, but rather presents theorems and proofs in rapid succession. Good as a reference book, but poor for instruction, which surely is the purpose of an introductory book."
3,Get liquid nails,You will have to put extra glue (liquid nail) to keep it stuck on. The self adhesive is not strong enough to last.
2,"Looks good, performs poorly","Don't expect too much from this product. The glue backing does not hold well at all. However, I still have the product in place by applying more of a glue product I had at home."
3,Good but too wordy,"This book has a lot of great ideas to use with kids, but I was looking for something to serve as a quick reference with a list of activities, how to do them, when to do them, etc. Still, the case examples prove very insightful."
1,DANGER DONT BUY THIS JUNK you will BURN YOUR HOUSE,"NEVER BUY PANASONIC CHARGERS WITH PANASONIC BATTERIESTHEY GET AS HOT AS 170-180 F and this is almostclose to boiling point of water.TOO HOT... KILLS THE BATTERIES TOO.GET REAL CHARGERS GET SLOW CHARGERSBEST COMBO IS SANYO ON PLANET IF MADE I N JAPANDO NOT GET CHINA STUFF FOR nimh BATTERIESMOST CHEATING GOING ON THERE for china made stuff.in any case, even if made in JAPANIGNORE PANASONIC LIKE A DISEASECAN BE FATALTAKE IT OFF MARKET AND SUE THEM PLEASE"
3,"Good reference, but a very harsh reviewer.","The reference is very valuable, though not quite exhaustive. And if anything other than highbrow humor makes you laugh, then try to avoid reading the reviews of the albums, they'll just make you mad. The harsh criticism of record after record makes you wonder if the author actually has a sense of humor."
4,RV electrical guide,"The book is wonderful and easy to follow with good illustrations and photographs. It covers pretty much the gammut of electrical items found on an RV -- way more than I will probably need, but its good to know it's all there. The book was purchased used and the description stated in excellent condition, but when it arrived, it was not what I would call excellent -- dog eared pages and warped pages- like the top end of the pages had gotten wet. It is still very readable and usable, but I strongly disagree with the booksellers rating of its quality."
4,"Advanced for most beginning RVers, but great info here!","I learned a great deal about the RV electronics reading this book. I highly recomend this for those who do most of their own DC and AC work on thir RV. If you just take your RV in to the shop and have electrical work done it may not be good book for you. However, it may help give you some understanding on how things work. The book goes way into detail and may be over some people's heads or just simply too dull. I gave it four stars instead of five for this very reason. I loved it and will use it as resource because it explains how the electrical systems work in depth."
2,Most Information is Obsolite,"This book is only marginally usful as it is very out of date most of the systems in my motorhome are not even covered. Some one with no knowledge of electricity whatsoever might gleen something from this book. Most of the Digital stuff and high end controls are not in there There are no chapters on slide controls, Diesel Gensets,etc"
3,expected more,"Book has a lot of basics of electricty but I expect more detail on how RV's are wired. IE. schematics of how RV's are wired, both 12 vdc and 110 ac."
3,"Not bad, little bulky and pretty heavy","I bought this watch because it was recommended by someone, though it is not my usual style. It's a good quality watch for a very affordable price with lots of features, but it is very heavy. I also have the Pierre Cardin watch which I like it better; it's not as bulky and heavy and looks much more elegant. Not a bad watch though if you want to spice up things and draw attention to your arm :)"
2,Not my style,"I consider my style to be fairly classic and I found this too flashy. The gold was too yellow for my taste and it was very thick, making it seem a little cheap. I generally wear unisex/men's watches but will be returning this one."
1,BRACELET TYPE WATCH!,"if you like dangling watch like a bracelet, then this watch is for you... The watch is nice but I was not expecting that after removing the links, the watch still didn't fit me :-( too bad I cannot return it anymore."
5,No disappointment here!,"I am totally pleased with this purchase.Recommended to anyone looking for a hefty, good looking man's or boyfriend's watch.Awesome!"
4,Great value for a nice watch.,"I received the item in less than 24 hours of ordering. Great shipping. I received the watch and opened the packaging and inspected the item before removing it from the holder. I noticed there was a few noticeable scratches on the metal part of the face. One scratch was deep and noticeable up close. That was quite disappointing. Still, I decided to keep it since it was for a decent price and I am planning to use it daily and I'm sure scratches will accumulate quick. I would have given this 5 stars but the noticeable scratches bumped it down a notch. Also it did not come with any documentation and doesn't explain how to adjust the certain settings."
4,Nice Looking watch!,"Great watch, excellent appearance, very well made ''magnificent finish looks just like more expensive watches and catches the eye at a reasonable price!"
2,cheap looking,I received this watch yesterday. It came very fast but it looks very cheap and gawdy. Based on reviews i thought i would receive a expensive looking watch. NOT AT ALL. The face looks very expensive and beautiful but the bracelet is horrible. It does not look gold but copper. No handbook was given also. I really wanted this watch badly but it will be returned:( My search continues..
3,Ok for the price,"The watch is a beautiful, solid looking piece. However it loses its luster when you bring it into a dark room. About an hour after you bring it in the dark the hands disappear! The only thing that is left are the numeral positions. They stay lit all night long. I would ask Armitron, ""Where did you get the hands""? However I probably know the answer to that question already..."
2,Not a good buy,"Bracelet was very light weight and felt cheap, it had a very flat finish that looked like it would rub right off. I returned it immediately as I would never wear something that looked this cheesy. I paid $50 and it didn't look like it was worth more than $10. Not a good buy."
3,Great Watch but not the lowest price in town,"I bought this watch because I wanted a ""trendy"" large faced watch but did not want to spend too much money. I thought that the price of US$50 was great and was even happier to find out that Amazon gave a discount when applying for their credit card leaving the price of the watch to just over US$23!!! The watch is PERFECT however, I am very unhappy to find out that my friend's mom bought her the SAME WATCH for US$20 at Kohls with NO discount. It is disappointing to shop at Amazon thinking they have the best prices when really they don't.I recommend the watch, not Amazon."
1,This is a hub/repeater not a switch!,"even though it says switch i recieved a netelligent 3124 repeater that you have to do everything for unlike a switch.But that's what i get for buying a switch on amazon without a model number to check up on.Disapointed that seller says new and sent a refurbished even though i kind of thought it was too cheap to be new.I also assumed this ""switch"" was going to be the average 10/100rj-45 ports but they are just 10mb/s ports which i bought this for small LAN parties we have in the area and now cant use it due to misinformation."
4,Brief but intriguing,"As often happens in this medium, more questions are raised than answered -- that's why we read books. But for an overview of the problems facing the war on terror, this insightful and well-researched video delivers the best documentary available."
5,Great DVD by Boss Hogg Outlawz - check out his homie Devin the Dude,"Slim Thug always Da Boss - also check out Smoke Sessions, Vol. 1- from his homie Devin the Dude another 5 Stars."
3,Great thus far.. but floor attachment won't stay on wand!,"Everything works fine except the floor attachment is immediately released when you engage the steam. It literally propels the floor attachment across the floor. Have emailed the company for help. Assume if I get no response the next thing I'll do is use 2 part epoxy gule and make it a permanent attachment. Otherwise, this thing is really powerful."
1,"Worst product on the market, Euro-Pro is the worst company to deal with","I purchased this item to clean my shower. It's ceramic tile and I thought this steam cleaner would be the perfect solution to my problem. I spent 2 hours and barely finished the floor and it wasn't that great. I could hardly move my arm the next day. There's no way I could finish my shower, but due to personal issues I missed the 60 trial and am stuck with it. I wouldn't even try to sell it at a yard sale, it's worthless. Save your money."
2,broke after first use,"This unit is a huge waste of money. It did not clean my stove or the hard water stains in my shower. After spending a good forty minutes trying to remove the stains from my oven, I finally broke down and used Easy-off and was done in 5. The coup de grace was that when I went to try to use the next day, the attachment end had a huge leak in it, spraying steam everywhere except where I wanted it to go, rendering the whole thing useless. Do not waste your money on this product."
2,There are better products out there.,"I'm a teacher and I don't have a lot of time to spend cleaning the house. A friend told me about a wonderful new machine to make my household tasks easier...a vapor steam cleaner. Unfortunately, I thought the Shark Portable was what she was referring to. As it turns out, this thing is a major disappointment.I told my friend about my frustration and she told me to go to [another web site] and take a look. I did and I bought what they call a Vapor 2000. What a product! While the Shark Portable leaks water all over the place, and actually makes cleaning more work, I cleaned and sanitized my kitchen and bathrooms in no time flat with my 2000 and a little tap water. What a gift for a ""cleaning fanatic"" like me who doesn't have the time to clean...and who hates using chemicals.I'd pass on the Shark if I were you. There are better products out there."
1,Put your money elsewhere.,"I'll make this simple. I bought the Shark and had all kinds of problems getting it to clean anything. [M]y hubby...got me a stainless steel vapor cleaner for Christmas. Oh sure, it cost more than the Shark. But it's built like a tank, doesn't leak, and it cleans like the dickens. The Shark should be recalled. Put your money elsewhere."
1,Should be removed from shelves,"This is the second shark cleaner I have used. After using it for a day, steam started coming out of everywhere. I almost burned my hand with this product. This should be recalled by Shark. (...)"
1,I would not buy it.,"If I could give it negative star I would have rated it negative 5. It worked once (15-20 min. usage). Second time steam leaked from everywhere (top screw cap, hose joint to the tank and handle). It burned my hand. If I still had the box I would have send it back and ask for my money. Very poorly designed, low quality, not reliable and not safe."
1,Law Suit Waiting to Happen,"I received this product as a Birthday gift and it worked for maybe 10 min., before steam and hot water came out of every seam in the handle. I made sure that I follow all the companies directions. I tried repeatedly to call the company to see if this was normal but it was busy everytime I called. Someone can get seriously burned from this product. I don't recommend this product to anyone and will be returning mine."
1,BEWARE of this product,"I agree with Gina from Florida - this is a dangerous machine. I bought the Euro-Pro Shark SC505 today, and I'll be returning it tomorrow.I was using it to clean my tile floors, and it seemed to be doing an acceptable although messy job. Suddenly, the darn thing just went crazy - hissing, spitting and then a huge blast of steam came out of it. My puppy was close by, thankfully just out of reach of the steam or it would have gotten him full in the face. As it is, my arm got slightly scalded.Thinking this might have been a fluke, or that I did something wrong, I let the machine cool down then refilled it and waited to try again. It started to leak water everywhere while steam started to come out of the handle and hose. No steam, however, from the nozzle where it is supposed to come from.This machine is a waste of time, in addition to being dangerous. Don't buy it."
2,While it worked it was great!!!,I have parrots and it was a lifesaver for cleaning cages. It broke after 4 months! The electrical just stopped working. I would not recommend for this reason. It did get me hooked on using steam or vapor and I wish I had bought a larger more expensive cleaner. I wish I hadn't wasted $100 on something that lasted 4 months.
1,"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE","It worked great the first time, but the second time it was absolutely no good. The cap seized after the second use and the whole unit turned when I tried to get the cap off. It's garbage now. I wrote to them and the answer I got was a totally different answer for the question I asked."
1,Defective trigger,"Do not buy the Shark Portable Steamer under any circumstances. The trigger mechanism is defective and fails after a few uses, causing all of the steam to leak out uncontrollably, which is also exposes the user to a possible steam burn. Euro-Pro Operating LLC does not stand behind its products. They will not sell you a replacement trigger or hose assembly if it fails (and trust me, it will fail). Instead, Euro-Pro wants you to spend $40 ($12.95 shipping + $27.00 ""minimum"" repair charge) to even look at it. Replacement parts are an additional charge! I can buy a competing product for the cost of Euro-Pro's ""minimum repair"" charge, shipping charge, + parts charge. Euro-Pro's service after the sale stinks. I will not buy Shark Products or do business with Euro-Pro Operating LLC ever again."
1,Waste of money,"I can't believe this item has recieved a single positive feedback. After using my steamer for the first time (which lasted about 10 minutes and got me through about half of my bathtub), I refilled the tank and plugged the item back in to heat it up again per the instructions. Within minutes, scolding hot steam was pouring out the handle of the steamer itself, I could barely get close enough to unplug the thing... what a dangerous joke. Worst part about the whole thing is I've been trying to contact the company for over a week, but I have had no answer to my emails and they won't even pick up the phone... I guess it's time to contact the Better Business Bereau... I hope everyone else will too..."
3,Disappointed,I was happy with this product but it broke after using it for a week. I contacted the maufacturer and I now have to pay to ship it back. I think it is unfair to have to put out more money for something that was defective. This is the reason I do not often make purchases online.
1,GARBAGE,"This product will fail quickly and will subject you to SERIOUS burns. Do NOT buy this product. You will regret it. This company should be put out of business, and Amazon should not allow their products to be sold."
3,Works great - for about 3-4 months,"This was a great machine for about 3-4 months. We had bought a new house and I cleaned just about everything with it in the house, basement and car. But after about 3-4 months it quite working so well, only gives you about 5 minutes of use and then doesnt use all the water you put in. Great concept, but this Shark model is not such a great machine."
2,Great - at first,"I loved this steamer at first. It was great for cleaning in hard to reach corners and the crack between the counter and stove. The problem was that it quite working after only about 4 months. Steam stopped coming out of the hose assembly, and shortly after that the ready light stopped coming on. It doesn't do anything when I plug it in, and Euro-pro is impossible to deal with!"
1,Hose attachment melted,"After an hour of use, the fitting that attaches the hose to the base melted and loosened and now it leaks. I can't find a supplier of spare parts for this machine."
4,Works Great If You Follow The Instructions,"This thing really does have amazing steam cleaning power! As long as you ""steam and then wipe"" like they say in the instructions, this steamer does a great job. My unit did an awesome job cleaning window tracks and hard to clean soap build up on tile grout in the bathroom. This is not a spot remover or a carpet cleaner, it's a hard surface steam cleaner. I got the impression from some other reviews that people weren't sure how to use the product or what to use it on. I've tried other steam cleaners and nothing matches this one for steam power and running time. If you follow the cleaning tips in the instruction manual you will be impressed with this Shark's cleaning ability just like I was."
1,WHAT A WASTE!!!,"After spending 3+ hours on our shower average-size shower (and still it is not done), I've had it with this piece of junk and am returning it to Target. What a waste of time, money, and energy. I followed the instructions to the T. Had to re-fill the thing four times. Had to wear earplugs because the noise was so loud (I still have ringing in my right ear and I used the thing last night!). Even got my husband in on it and he had the same problems. We sprayed, we scrubbed, we rinsed . . . might as well have not used the steamer at all for the good it did (none). Use the money on hiring yourself a housecleaner. UGH!!!"
1,Worst Product I ever bought at Target,"I just bought this cleaner today. After reading the instructions two times and following every step I started using it. It started smelling like burnt plastic 2 minutes after I turned it on, and then hot steam started shooting towards my arms. I couldn't turn it off fast enough!To sum up the quality of this product: it is dangerous and I do not recomend buying it unless you like 3rd degree burns."
3,Excellent Product - for basic cleaning,"If you just want to clear slight greasy stains from your stovetop or a few surface level moldy spots - then this is the product for you. Anything more than that - don't waste your time or $$.<br /><br />Steam will run constant for only about 1 min., then you'll have to stop and wait about 10-20 secs. for the ""green"" light again. I found that annoying even for basic cleaning.<br /><br />Accessories seemed very durable - although I didn't keep the product long enough test them out."
1,This is not the cleaner you are looking for,"After about a day of use, the hose attachment started leaking steam from multiple locations.And while it was functioning, I found that it has enough high pressure steam pressure for about 10 seconds of use -- after which I would have to wait about 15 seconds for it to heat back up to a high enough pressure to remove tough dirt."
1,NO QUALITY AT ALL,I purchased one of the shark pro steamers and used it once. Came back to it a month later and the cap had seized totally shut. They are aware of the problem but fail to document it or do anything about it. The steamer is about 100 buck and to send it back for repair is 25 buck shipping and another 50 to Inspect. For that price I should just toss it in the trash or use it as a $100 paper weight that's all it's good for. Don't buy anything from euro pro!!!! they make junk.
1,Watch out,I purchased the steam cleaner. WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!! It does NOT work on stoves. The thing for mirrors. WHAT A MESS. Had water every where. If you use the one part for around your sink. Well that makes more of a mess for you to clean up. Hard water? what a laugh. Wont take the hard water off. The handle was so hot it was burning my hand. You use the steam cleaner you need to purchase air freshner because the steam cleaner put out a weird smell. i would give this product a F-
2,Got the right idea - wrong product,"I got this machine and found it was not what I thought. Yes, it steams - pretty strong too, but it only came out one way - Full blast. It makes cleaning a lot of things difficult. Some things were very dangerous to maneuver while this thing was hanging off my side. It tipped over once and boiling water started to spit out of the nozzle. That was it for me. I liked the idea just not this product.(...)"
3,No leaking here,"The only leaking I have had with mine happened when I didn't have the lid secure. The metal loop that holds the shoulder strap was in the up position keeping the lid from being securely tightened. This allowed water & steam to escape. I immediately unplugged it, let the pressure out, and adjusted it as soon as the pressure released - no problem.It doesn't burn my hand unless I put it in the way of the steam. It does get warm but is not uncomfortable. I'm happy with it. It does what I expected."
3,good for specialized jobs,"I didnt end up using this for as many tasks as I thought. THe steam is actually really loud, and i would get a headache after 10 min. It was the only thing I could use when I was pregnant though and it is great for cleaning out the hinge on the toilet seat. Anyone who has boys in the house knows how dirty those get. Also its wonderful for shooting out the tracks in the windows. I didnt think that it worked on really heavy duty things like soap scum, but it does leave a streak free shine on laminate wood floors."
2,Fabulous til it breaks,"I have purchased and returned two of these. Initially they worked fantastic! I cleaned a gunky old gas stove and an oven, cleaned tile, floors, bathroom etc. I was very happy...until after about 5 hours of use, both units broke. The problem appeared to be the o-rings for the trigger attachment on the hose. The same thing happened with each unit. The manufacturer said they would send out a replacement part, but no one could tell me if they had actually re-engineered the part against future breakage. I wish it was more reliable, because if it was, I would buy another one."
1,Total Dud,"Unlike the OTHER Euro-Pro steamer I tried, this one lasted an entire week, rather than 24 hours. And during that week, it did a bang-up job. Then there was a sputter, and the heating element went dead forever. Having been through this with two different steamer models from Euro-Pro, I've learned two things:I really want a quality steamer.Euro-Pro does not make quality steamers."
1,Same exact experience,"Does a fabulous job of cleaning my bird cage, but I had the same experience. I'm on my third Shark, since the first two hoses literally blew their gaskets, leaking SCALDING hot water which poured down the handle. If I hadn't been wearing very thick rubber gloves, I would have been badly burned. The only reason I've continued to buy it is that it does do a tough job very well..if you can keep it working: must hold it steady and not curve the hose at all, or it will blow.This product should be recalled... (...) I am returning number three, and not replacing it unless it is redesigned."
1,Junk,I returned mine after one try. It was hard to handle. Harder to clean up after. It burned me more than once. Every time you pressed the trigger you made a larger mess. It was nothing like shown on TV. The plastic parts were not durable. JES
1,Want this? FORGET IT!,"This steam cleaner does nothing compared to the TV commercial. I tried using it on my pots and pans and mega-hot steam was blowing into my face, I then used it in my sink because there was some dried-on toothpaste on it which they say it will remove... it didn't budge a bit. If you want to get ripped-off buy this, if you want to save money don't buy this. (...)."
4,not bad,This works great on tile grout! it would be nice if it worked good on the glass shower doors but it didn'tNot bad for the price. It does take a long time to get the job done.
1,Cannot get replacement parts.,I have emailed the manufacturer 3 times trying to get replacement parts. No response. What can I do?
2,Good Idea but poor product,"Great idea of non-chemical cleaner. I tried it out with my hardwood floor, kitchen, dry clean clothes, and everything they claimed that this machine could do. After one month, one or two part broke due to poor construction, I end up returning the product and obtain another one because I still love the idea of steam cleaning. At this point, I am sick of returning the product withing 90 days period, secondly, customer service is not great either. At this point, I am ready to give up return/exchange scheme altogether. Euro-Pro should build a sturdier attachments that devoid of plastics as much as possible."
2,Loud steamer,"I tried this steamer and I think it does a pretty good job cleaning, however I ended up taking it back because when I added the brush attachment to clean stove it made a high pitched noise that hurt my ears. Even after I turned it off I could still hear it ringing in my ears. And the one I had after you had it on a steady steam for a couple of min. it started sputtering, didn't want to try another one"
4,Buggy out of the box vs. Great Bang for the Buck,"I'm keeping this simple. This DVD player plays DVD audio and performs well once updated, includes progressive scan and MP3 playback. It's a great DVD player and I would give it a 5 star review if it weren't for some major issues. JVC needs to upgrade the firmware so it is compatible with all DVDs. You will have to upgrade a subtitle problem with the Phantom Menace DVD and other DVDs. The player gets really hot and is reported to lock up on people. I think it might have to do with the heat, so keep it well ventilated. I haven't experienced lockups yet. In other words, buy it, send it immediately back to JVC to have the firmware or the eprom replaced while it's covered under warranty (sorry, this can't be updated using CD-RW) and then you'll own a great DVD player for the money."
1,Good when it worked,"Produced fine quality images on my HDTV -- when it worked. However, it has suddenly gone on the blink after less than one year of fairly light use, failing to recognize certain DVD's and occasionally displaying mysterious onscreen messages telling me it is ""searching for software updates"".Needless to say, it's been sent back to the manufacturer for attention. While parts are still under warranty, labor costs are only covered for 90 days. With current new product prices and technician billing rates, it may not be justified to repair the thing.Bottom line is that I am not terribly pleased with the quality of this product, and would recommend considering similar alternatives from other manufacturers."
4,DVD Audio and Progressive Scan,I was looking for a player for a future HT setup. This player has the progressive scan for HDTV and DVD Audio. I let it repeat a CD for 12 hours with no lock up or any other problems and it played Fast and Furious 3x non stop with no dropouts or any problems. Crutchfield by the way has it for [price].
4,Good DVD and cheap,"I bought this DVD player because I like the JVC brand. I am in no way an Electronics expert but I do alot of research before I buy. This DVD was about everything I needed. i wanted a CD/MP3 player, so I didn't have to get a CD player. It also has progressive scran which seemed great but I have an HDTV and it hasn't seemed to work. The DVD player is inputted to the Component of the TV but the DVD never recognizes it, so the player never uses the progressive scan mode. That's pretty much my only gripe with the player. The MP3 player doesn't have a random option but I can deal with that. I don't know if the progressive scan doesn't work on every player but I couldn't seem to get this one to work."
3,"Widescreen or not Widescreen, that is the question.....","Please ignore the star rating. THe French Connection is a great film.My concern it that the ad states that this is widescreen. However, when I recieved the DVD, there is no indication on or inside the case as to whether it is widescreen or fullscreen.After watching the film, I still can't determine it, but there are no black bars showing and my TV is a widesreen TV.All my other widescreen DVDs look different than this one, so I am assuming this in not widescreen, despite what the ad states.Just a word of caution to those who are widescreen purists."
5,Great double dose of Popeye (Doyle),"I was happy to recieve this film which I ordered from Amazon. I remember seeing The French Connection when it first came out in theaters and watching it again, along with the equally satifying sequel French Connection 2, was a real treat. Gene Hackman won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Doyle and his reprisal in the sequel is just as good, if not better than the original. I was very pleased with the movies and find them both very enjoyable every time I watch them. I highly recommend them both to anyone who is a fan of great performances in great films."
3,Rambles,"The book is very informative, as it should be, but I felt the author had the tendency to beat a topic to the pulp. I was often ready to move on, but they just kept going."
5,Would purchase through them again!,"The book was in great condition, as they stated, and the shipping was faster than I expected! I had already started the class and was worried about the book not coming in on time, that wasnt an issue!"
1,Sexism at its best,"In all of the textbooks and gender courses taken, I have never come across such a worthless book. The author makes an obvious point to bash ment he entire time. In fact, the text was hated so much as an entire class that all members rebelled against the professor for even choosing such rubbish. After the first couple fo chapters, we as a class began bringing in examples of why this writing was so ridiculous for each chapter. I wish I were speaking just as a male here, however of the 30 people in the college course, many of which were strong feminists, many womens study majors, and a couple guys scattered, it was an overwhelming dislike for this book."
1,Totally biased,"The overall theme of this book is man bashing, and bases too much on stereotypes. I used this book for class, and it was hell reading it."
4,Interesting Perspective,"This book was thought provoking and really made me think about my own views on gender and how they were developed. It gives an interesting overview of the history of feminism which lays a good foundation for understanding the various movements today. The discussion on male gender issues was interesting, and I would have liked more of that perspective. Some of the passages I found challenging to my conservative perspecitve and there were definately points of discussion that I didn't agree with. At the same time it was interesting to learn about the perspective others had. I really enjoyed the portions of the book that included other students responses and perspectives within the chapters."
1,Thought it was very one-sided,"In my opinion, this book was a complete waste of trees. To my conception, 90% of this book was about how women are discriminated against and how men are the cause. The other 10% felt like the writer included men just to be ""balanced"". I believe this book is very one sided and painted men as the bad guys. I was very disappointed. Thank God my professor (who is a woman) agreed on this, and brought op both sides of the spectrum."
5,"The Best ""Text Book"" I have ever read","I bought Gendered Lives for a course that I am taking, so I consider it a text book. Despite that, this book has enabled me to fully understand gender in an unbiased way. Wood writes from an objective perspective, which allows for the reader to fully understand all aspects of the word gender. The language of the text is accessible for all students of all ages and academic background."
2,Poorly structured website (the company),"The book was fine and I received it in time, but I became aware after ordering it that I would not need it. I searched for return policies but they were apparently unavailable to me. I was ultimately unable to return the book before the return deadline and will now have the burden of selling it."
3,Certainly for feminists,"This text was required for a sociology class I took several semesters ago. I found it to be interesting, but not really worth my time nor effort. The author makes several respectable points in relation to communication interaction between genders and cultures, especially the media's portrayal of women; however, I feel it was overall extremely biased. The text sells itself as, ""Gendered Lives."" Ok, fine! However, the book SCREAMS feminist literature! It truly is nothing more than one author's attempt to disregard the female gender's responsibility for their suppression, and unload the blame on the male populous. If you're looking for a male bashing book, filled to the brim with feminism, this is certainly the book for you. Nevertheless, if you're looking for equal gender representation, you're better off looking elsewhere."
2,Not the book for me,"I didn't like the book. I had to read it for class. It was interesting to read, but she put so much facts in there that I couldn't remember everything that she said. It needs to be more oraganized and maybe less man biased like the other two men said. Before bashing me or my review, I'm a woman.Edit: I put two stars, but I meant one, I changed my mind."
1,Man Haters handbook,"Julia Wood takes every chance she can to insult and denigrate men. In fact, the only men she will acknowledge in a positive way are those who have distinctly ""feminine"" traits. Many feminists may find this refreshing and validating, but it does little to foster better communication or interaction with members of the opposite sex. Wood is guilty of the same spiteful attacks on men that she portrays as happening to women."
5,A must read!,"Having used this textbook in Prof. Wood's course at UNC, I must recommend it not only for students but also for those who are naturally inquisitive as well. Wood has a remarkable ability to distill issues into root cause and extract significant implications. At the same time, this book reads more like a work of literature than a collegiate text, making it engaging, insightful and thought provoking. Kudos to Prof. Wood."
3,Not bad,"Ok, so I was totally not even the slight bit interested in reading a book like this one, but alas, for one of my classes this semester I was required to partake. I must admit that I initially had a difficult time relating to the rhetoric and struggled throught the first chapters ... only because of my poor attitude. However, there are a couple of chapters on communication between the sexes that were incredibly intriguing, so much that I would recommend them to anyone and everyone. I disagreed often with some of Wood's assertions, however, I found that the reason for my differing viewpoint was based on the fact that I could not empathise with her statements. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in gender relations and the real story behind feminist theory/history, not to mention someone interested in communication discrepancies between the mars and venus."
4,Gendered Lives is a good read,"I was assigned this book for my Gender, Race and Class class but I enjoyed it so much that I am not selling it back! I found standpoint theory helpful as I try to figure out where I stand in the world of feminism. As a minority, I liked reading about different cultures. So many textbooks are White. But this one wasn't. It was refreshing."
2,Stains on a brand new flag?,i just don't understand how you can have stains on a new flag. Not really sure how to review it. Product got here quick and i was satisfied until i opened the flag up.
3,huge,made cheaply fabric is see thru. for school events does the job huge size colors are vibrant . low budget
5,BEAUTIFUL FLAG,"THE COLORS WAS EXQUISITE AND THE COAT OF ARMS WAS BEAUTIFULLY ABSOLUTELY CORRECT! I will recommend this to anyone that loves España/Spain culture, history, or the flag itself! :) ¡Viva España!"
5,Spain Cosplayer,"It's great for cosplay use but its really thin, and also it feels like satin so that's pretty cool but yea over all really good! Plus it came earlier than expected"
2,"came broken, not worth the hassle to return","Toy does not go forward when released after winding. The description is non-existent, so I have no idea if this is a defect or a design of the toy.It's not worth the hassle of a return, since it was only 7 dollars. I would not recommend buying this toy, however."
1,it does not have subtitles,"Before I order a telenovela I make sure it has subtitles. This one had none. Before I bought it, I checked and on the page it said that this telenovela has subtitles."
1,Miss Haney's unauthorized book is a loser,"I knew Gregory Peck very well for many years. I also knew his first wife Greta, their sons, Jonathan, Steven and Carey Paul. I was also close to Veronique, his second wife and their family.Like many of the Peck family friends, I was devestated by Lynn Haney's deliberate misrepresentation of Gregory Peck's personal life.This unauthorized biography is not worth the paper it's printed on. Hopefully, an authentic biographer will profile with accuracy and respect the life of a great man."
1,John O'Dowd isn't the only one,"I always like seeing my name in print, but after reading Mr. O'Dowd's comments, I figure I should chime in. My experience is very much like Mr. O'Dowd's ... I am quoted (a bit incorrectly, but close enough) in Haney's book, and am named as the speaker who asks Peck a question about acting in bad movies, but I was never contacted about the anecdote, which comes in fact from my personal blog. It's also worth noting that Haney gets the context of the anecdote wrong ... she calls me a ""journalist"" speaking to Peck ""around"" the time Boys from Brazil came out (1978), when the conversation I had with Peck came more than ten years later, when I was just a graduate student sitting in an auditorium while Peck took some questions from the audience.And, again like Mr. O'Dowd, I am very easy to reach, via the very website where Haney found the anecdote in the first place.If my experience, and that of Mr. O'Dowd, is any indication, I don't suppose I'll be buying Haney's book."
2,Disappointing Biography,"This should have been a well-written book about a fascinating man. But it never quite captured the sense of Mr. Peck. Part of the problem may have been the distracting and numerous typos, grammatical errors and an annoying habit of veering off onto subjects that were only slightly related and which are already the stuff of Hollywood lore, written about MANY times before."
3,The Man Behind the Mask,"Mr. Peck is revealed to be a career-driven man during most of the early part of his career (and something of a heavy drinker), to the detriment of himself and of his family. His successful second marriage of several decades is attributable to his wife's indulging him excessively (a state much sought after by the male of our species, but seldom found). THAT in itself is the major secret, the linch-pin for his ""charmed"" life. He didn't become the Atticus Finch look-a-like until much later (better late than never). The reader comes away better informed about Mr. Peck, but not necessarily in awe of or awestruck by him, and certainly not excited by the story of his life. For those seeking tales of a more adventurous life, may I suggest you try ""Burt Lancaster - an American Life"" by Kate Buford."
4,"Book,","It is a good documentary of Peck's life. Not an outstanding book, but well written and some of the information I am sure you could find online."
1,"Questions, please.",I want to know what is in the box? I want an A/C adapter.Canon P23-DH V 2 color mini-Desktop Printing Calculator
1,canon printing calculator,I ordered this so i would have a printed record of what iwas adding and doing other things but tape willnot feed even when you push the feed button
5,Canon printer evaluation.,"I also have this calculator at work and I really like it. It is considerably quieter than the larger one that I had and is very useful for the types of tasks that I perform. At home, I will be using it to keep my check book in order. The tapes that are used can be found in many stores and it is a nice size for either home or office."
3,Not a bad little calculator.....,"Not a bad calculator for the price.The directions for all the little extras are poorly written,and a bit difficult to follow, but for the basic mathematical equations, it's not bad."
4,MISSING A PART,THE PRINTER IS FINE EXCEPT THAT THERE IS NO INK ROLLER INCLUDED IN THE PACKAGE.IF WE CAN GET AN INK ROLLER EVERYTHING WOULD BE OK.
3,Paper Sold Separately,I was disappointed when I opened this item that there was not a roll of paper included. The photo shows a roll of paper and I didn't notice anywhere on the listing that paper wasn't included. I ordered this machine because I needed an adding machine with a tape for my office. Now I have to go out and buy a roll of paper. Very inconvenient.
1,Wrong Color,This calculator is great if Amazon sends you the correct color (silver/black) as shown. I was sent a white model that looked ancient. I have used this model calculator for years and it has served me well. Perfectly sized for my small desk. Features are good. I love the calendar and time feature.
2,I returned it,"this requirement is really dumb, I returned it because I didn't like it. way tooo much on it for what I was looking for."
3,cheaper,i have found this same machine with a free pocket calc for less MONEY works ok just don't see why you folks arent competive
3,Might need some re-organization,"I am not a professional scientist. Though I would say the author presents a clear idea of the Pendulum, the depth of understanding, unfortunely, in my humble opinion, is not enough. Also, the author seems to be dragged by the history/blunder of Louise-Napoleon too much that he devoted a great length of the book about him. A whole chapter is about a military defeat in Sedan against Prussia after Foucault's death. I have no idea how it is related Foucault & the Pendulum. However, in a much shorter chapter in the middle of the book, the author only touches the topic of gyroscope, another great achievement by Foucault, lightly. Also, it would have been much better if the second proof of Foucault's sine law has a better illustration since the radius r of the pendulum is a really important part of the proof, it is weird that the diagram/illustration of the proof just misses it."
3,An interesting tale lacking detail.,"The book is well written in its telling of the trials and tribulations of this often historically over-looked, self-taught physicist. However, the work lacks in conveying what I considered to be significant detail that left me wanting. Specifically, the work refers often to the rotating anchorages of Foucault's pendulums, yet not one detailed description or illustration is offered of this key component; this, the very innovative aspect that set Foucault's pendulums apart from all that preceeded it! Another mention of a electromagnetic device developed by Foucault to maintain his pendulums in motion; again, no details!!! To sum it up; the book lacks in technical detail."
3,Tour of 2nd Empire France,"When about 4, I visited the majestic Foucault pendulum housed in the Los Angeles Observatory. It was awe inspiring and I've never forgotten the experience. I was hoping this little book would help me understand the experiment and my reaction. In both cases, the book was only partially successful.At a scientific level, the book is a failure. Don't expect to learn any physics, or even improve your understanding of pendulums.At the level of 'history of science', the book is a mixed bag. The history is anecdotal, reminding me of a 'grand-tour' of 2nd Empire celebrities. Sprinkled in, one will find a second 'grand-tour' of flat-earth debates. Some of these anecdotes are hilarious. Unfortunately, you won't find much insight into the practice of 19th century science or Foucault's mind. The external details are of considerable interest, though. I have to say I enjoyed the read."
4,"The real ""as the world turns""","Years ago when I lived in California, my father used to take me to San Francisco, and one of the things we loved to see was the Foucault Pendulum in the Golden Gate Park. I didn't realize until I read this book the real significance of what the inventor had done. Prior to this invention, there was doubt in the religious world that the earth turned on its axis and there was a belief that the Universe moved around the earth. He showed by the use of a pendulum that hung from the ceiling and made marks in sand that the earth was indeed moving. Anyone who is interested in science, and even those who are not, should enjoy the story of this very inventive man."
1,"Cracks and falls apart in cold weather, should be rated for warm weather use only","Very disappointed. Installed it carefully, but in our cold Toronto winter the sweep portion just cracked and separated from the part that adheres to the door. Opt for something else if it's to be used in a cold winter weather application."
3,Maybe for hardwood floors,"I purchased this a few weeks ago, and it has since come off my door 3-4 times already. My door opens inwards over carpet (I live in an apt), and I guess the friction from the back and forth of the door is too much for this sweep. When it sticks, it works, and it was a very easy install (cut to length and place on the door). But unfortunately, I'll have to find something else."
4,Super easy installation,"We installed the MD self adhesive door sweep on our basement door that is a steel frame. The self adhesive was exactly what we needed and it was SUPER easy to install. We have had this installed for almost a year and have not seen any signs of the adhessive unsticking. The placement over the tile was important since it can stick when opening/closing the door, but it has been working well at keep bugs out."
1,Not good for carpet,"Overall waste of $5, but it was worth a shot. I bought this to prevent drafts on my door, but it makes the door more challenging to open on my carpet. The carpet isn't tall or anything, but I'd prefer another method that let the door move more freely."
3,Not so good for light,"I bought this item partly to block the light that comes in under the front door of my apartment from the hallway outside. Unfortunately while it does a good job of blocking the draft and does cut out some light, it is not entirely opaque so a lot of light still comes through. Colors other than white would probably do better."
3,ok for me,"not a for a door that is used often will not stick. try it at your own risk, not bad, not good"
3,Photo of door sweep is horrible,"I was looking at various door sweeps to decide which one to go with. Looking at yours all awhile it may be perfect, I really can't tell with the piss poor photo. You might as well not have a photo. How about this. Put up a photo of your cat and it will be much more help then the white line you have in this picture."
2,Doesn't hold up,"I can't really understand the attraction of this old series. I love the current version. How did the old one become a cult? The writing is trite, the acting is awful. But if you are interested in experiencing the old series, this is the way to do it."
2,Gene Whitlock's opinion.,We have purchased all 11 seasons of Hawaii Five-o and have enjoyed many hours of entertainment. We plan to also order season 12.
3,NOT BAD,"Despite the complaints by some fans that the last seasons of this series are not that good, I still enjoy every episode. I have just finished watching this season, and I had a great time. Although I admit that the stories are not as water tight as they were in the beginning.The music of the Bee Gees was fantastic!!! Pity Part 2 didnt have it.....oh well...big deal.One thing that I didnt like about some of these episodes...the propensity of McGarret to risk his life. In the ""skyline killer"" episode, if the cops were waiting for him.....why didnt they catch him? They keep saying how difficult this case was, then they almost miss the chance. He gets away, and McGarret risking his life up there may make good suspense TV, but frankly absurd that a Number One cop in Hawaii would do something like that. Lucky the guy didnt have a knife. Same in the last episode, where tecnically the way the fight was going he should have been kicked out and into the water!!!!!!"
5,Hawaii Five-0/Best Show On TV,"I have all of the Hawaii Five-0 seasons. 1 thru 11. I hope they will release the last one, which is season 12. I am 54 so when this show came out in 1968 I was young so watching this now is great. If you loved this show you should get all of the seasons."
5,Release date,"Does anyone know when Season 11 will be released? It has been available for pre-order for several months, but no release date is listed. The other seasons came out like clockwork, so I hope there is not going to be a delay with the release of the last 2 seasons."
2,So - so,"Great format and great idea, but put together and written with very little proof-reading by anyone with a college education. The vignettes remind me of high-school reports. Too bad that the civil rights theme is laid on the reader so heavily, as if to inspire us with tremendous guilt for the slavery issue. It's the same drone that the American Indians like to try to put on the American white man...""Don't you feel guilty for what your ancestors did to mine?"" The answer is ""No, I don't."" If I did, then I'd ask the same question of them, for their ancestors' slaughter of my ancestors. Should I feel guilty for my grandfather's abandoning his family in the Tennessee wilderness and running off with another woman? Answer...NO."
5,Selling the Memory,"Stephanie Yuhl's study of Charleston is a great read, organized brilliantly with metaphors from theatre, and wonderfully well written. As a newcomer to Charleston but a long time South Carolinian, I was fascinated by her account of how Charleston has marketed itself. Her analysis of the literature of the Charleston Renaissance is extremely insightful as is her critique of Charleston's most well known painters. But perhaps most astute is her analysis of class and race relations. This book is definitely a prize winner!Carolyn MataleneDistinguished Professor EmeritaUniversity of South Carolina"
4,Pretty on the countertop,"This butter dish definitely looks really good. If you want to have a butter dish you don't want to hide from company, this is it. The handle is a nice touch, having to grab the entire lid of a butter dish makes the dish somehow seem unfinished. It holds up well to the dishwasher and does not have any trouble coming out clean as a whistle. It's nice to know your butter is protected from light as well since the dish is opaque.Unfortunately, you do have to be careful about the placement of the butter to avoid it being a bit smushed by the lid. Also, if you buy large blocks of butter like I do, you will have to cut them down to size so that they can be properly protected by the dish."
2,amazon poor packaging,"The butter dish itself is great, we ended up getting it from a local store and cheaper.Reason we went looking was because Amazon is useless at packaging. They put a ceramic butter dish in a box........and thats it! No bubble wrap to even seperate the two parts. just a box, with a butter dish. Thing was smashed to hell when it got to me. Amazons responce? oh dear, we'll send you another one in six weeks when we get some more!Cancelled the order there and then."
1,Mission Impossible,"First it took an extremely long time to receive the order. Then I received the wrong color. I sent the item back and let them know they sent me a blue dish when I'd ordered a red one. They canceled my order and I never received the product. Needless to say, I'll never order from them again!!!!"
1,Wrong Color,"The product is fine. In fact, great. However, the image shown is not the color Caribbean. Caribbean is a light blue or aqua color and I was misled into purchasing the wrong color by the on line image."
2,Very disappointing!!,"This butter dish is much, much smaller than I expected. Trying to get the top over the stick of butter without schmearing the top with butter is next to impossible! And another thing............since when is Le Creuset made in Thailand??? From the looks of things, this will be a dust collector on the counter instead of a useful addition to my kitchen."
2,Hard to get lid off,"When the butter softens and you put the dish in the refrigerator, the lid tends to stick to the bottom plate because the softened butter has spread somewhat. Instead of sliding a butter knife under the lid to pry it loose, or just let it sit awhile, my daugher pulled on the the little knob on the top of the lid and broke it off. I don't feel like spending another $25.00 so, we use it without the little knob at the top -- looks like heck, tho."
2,Sent it back,IT is awkward to use. It is not made in France or USA... it is made in China. A stick of butter doesn't quite fit in it with the cover on. I sent it back.
2,"Looks nice, but not practical","This product looks great, however, the lip of the dish is high and makes it nearly impossible to slice the butter with a knife without chipping away at the edge of the butter dish every time. I wish I saw the dish without the lid on before purchasing because I would not have bought it."
5,Love the color Butter Dish,I am buying for a new vacation apartment and need specific colors to go with my dishes. This sturdy simple butter dish is perfect. I also have the sugar and creamer by Le Creuset in this Caribbean color. This is well made as are all Le Creuset products and the color is really lovely.
2,Top piece broke off on two separate purchases,"I love all things Le Creuset so I was especially disappointed with this purchase as the top holder broke off on two separate butter dishes I purchased. On the first purchase the top was dropped and I attempted to glue it back on with limited success, so I bought another and the second one broke by just picking up the handle. I have put an email out to Le Creuset and am hoping they will return it for a full refund."
5,Pretty darn good...,"Food snobs, read no further. Caught an Italian acquaintance (from Milan, no less) buying this stuff at the local Stop and Shop and he did not blush or break into hives when I saw him, simply said that it had an authentic taste and was dead easy to make. He's spot on and when you want an easy, tasty, unusual side, it's the ticket. Our boys who are meat and spud types, love it. Not so keen on the preservatives, et al., but doubt that it will be the cause of anyone's death."
3,this product has gluten in it but was put in your gluten free catagory,I bought the item because it was a 5 star rated product from your gluten free category. It was easy to make and quite good but made my wife I'll as she has an allergy to gluten. The offensive ingredient is MSG. So either remove the product from your gluten free category or have the manufacturer remove the MSG.
4,Missing core VB.Net concepts,"I read other reviews before purchasing this book. I understood that it was only a language reference, however I was still unprepared for how much VB.Net programming was not specifically related to the language.For example, this book does NOT contain:- Any information about data binding or data access- Any instruction on using or extending Windows or Web forms- Any ADO.Net or ASP.Net instructionYou must understand these topics to code any VB.Net application, and this book will not help. I heard this book was a second edition to Programming Visual Basic .Net by the same author (which has broad and deep coverage of VB.Net 2003) but that simply can't be the case.Balena has written a very specialized book, which covers some advanced topics well, such as:- OOP concepts, including inheritance and delegates- Generics- Regular Expressions- Reflection- Multi-threadingGood book, but only for coverage of advanced VB.Net 2005 language-specific topics."
5,Best book on VB.NET,"I have read through a few best selling VB.NET books and I believe this is the best book on the topic. The best part about this book is that it does not give the rehashed technical manual feeling that most other books would give you. Instead, you can tell the author had been planning to write this book for a while and he added many fine details about VB.NET and Framework which might have been puzzling you. However this book only comvers the core topics and there are some other fine details which are missed, so I recommend you reading together with Visual Basic 2005 Programmer's Reference (Programmer to Programmer). That book gives you the rehashed feeling, though."
4,Great book -- but probabably not for newbies,"The things I like about this book are that the topics it covers are very well done. It covers some of the trickier aspects like threading and regular expressions. Being an experienced programmer I like the fact that you can jump around in the book to just the aspects of the language that you are interested. I will warn the novice programmer that this is probably not a good starter book, but if you are ready for the material you will find that it has a good balance of code examples, and explanation.There are just a few spots in the code example where I can see a slightly better implementation, but if you are an experienced programmer this will not be difficult at all to see yourself.Last but not least, the appendix is one of the beefiest one's I have seen in ANY programming book. If there is anything I hate about tech books is a lousy appendix and this one is top notch."
4,VB 6 TO VB 2005 With Ease,I found this to be the best source I've read that reveals the code changes from VB 6 to 2005. The code samples explain in detail how to easily accomplish tasks in VB 2005.
5,Great VB book for serious VB Programmers.,"This is a great book.It has a lot of techniques that you would not normally use in your day to day programming tasks.It covers the language properly. Every chapter has actual code that works and that you could use in your projects.The author is definitely a master, and this book proves it.The book helped me to pass the MS Exam 70-536, .Net Framework 2.0, Application Development Foundation. Most of the exam topics are covered in it.The organization of the book is good, starts with the basics, slowly going to advanced topics.However I think this book is definitely not for beginners, they will get lost in some chapters.Overall, I give it 5 stars, it is a great book, well written, well organized, a great reference that every VB programmer should read and have it on their shelf."
1,"No ADO.NET, ASP.NET or Dataset information!!","This book was fraudulently marketed as ""fully revised and updated for Visual Basic 2005, providing definitive, one-volume reference"". It is nothing of the sort, it is a completely different book lacking significant and important key information of the prior 2003 version and hundreds of pages shorter. Something everyone will miss is the discussion on ADO.NET and ASP.NET. It is therefore NOT a ""one-volume"" reference unlike its predeccessors. It is also irritatingly targeted in several areas towards old VB programmers who never made the transition to .NET."
3,Good content but...,"As all Balena's books, this is no exception for quality and content, but I'm a bit disappointed by the fact that in all the previous versions of this series, he included the basics for ASP and ASP.NET. This time is the exception, because at least I wanted to find a brief information about web pages.May be it is a commercial trick or authors decision.Overall, it is a must have book."
5,A look inside the daily life of an extraordinary 19th century woman,"Though I am a bit biased because of a family connection to this woman,I found that the details of life from a woman's point of view duringthe 19th century to be extremely interesting. You may not care toread every entry but the author/editor has done an excellent job ofintroducing and summarizing particular time periods. A good way tolearn about history, transcendentalism, and Unitarian belief, as writtenby an intelligent and driven woman, whose son becomes a founding fatherof the National Geographic Society!"
3,Worked like a charm,Worked good for both my Craftsman Garden Tractor and also for a Troybuilt mower that I purchased used. I initially gave it 5 stars but knocked it down after the review settings made me add words before it would accept my feedback. The Key works great however.
4,Church music with Chimes,"I gave this cd a 4 not because it was not what I really wanted. I was looking for bells and chimes only, not any audio, however, having said that if you like both it would be worth it. The music is lovely."
1,Broke half way through first use.,The black porcelain bubbles glued to the glass back separated within hours of placing flowers in it for the first time. It'd be good if it were made adequately but it aint.
1,Big mistake I wish I had read the reviews first,"We put this on our wedding registry and at the time it was $59.00. At that price I assumed it would work very well as it costed more than most hand vacs. I was wrong and I regret not reading the reviews. Shark should have recalled this product. The battery is faulty. I charged overnight then used it to vacuum my car and it faded after 2 minutes. I assumed it just needed more charging time so I charged it for 2 days straight, I brought it to my car to vacuum the seat and it died again in 2 min. We have never been able to use this product successfully. It will take me 2 weeks to vacuum the entire at this rate."
1,Horrible,"Seemed like a good idea at the time, but I can't remember the last time I was this disappointed in a product. Right out of the box it worked okay, but within a week it was useless. Just no suction whatsoever. Forget using the extension hose; you can put your hand right against the opening and barely feel it. Wish I'd never wasted the money on this-- it's going right out to the trash and I've only used it about 3 times."
1,Don't Buy This Product!,"I bought this vacuum because of the overall value I thought it would provide, based on price, power, features and size of suction hole. Unfortunately, after just a few uses, the battery no longer held a charge. It would turn on for about 10 seconds and then run out of power. When I called the Euro-Pro technical help line to see if they'd stand behind their product, the person on the other end of the line agreed that the battery was no good -- however, the only solution he provided to the problem was for me to buy a new battery for almost what I paid for the vacuum. When I asked him if he thought the new battery would fail like the first battery, he tried to sell me another accessory and never answered my question. I will not buy another Euro-Pro product. I recommend that you avoid this product."
1,count this as a disposable vacuum,"this vacuum worked fine until its battery began to lose power, after less than a year and under very light use. It is impossible to find a replacement battery and it was too expensive to be a throwaway. Get a cheap Dustbuster instead...and face the same problem when you need a new battery but you won't have as much invested."
5,As good as it gets...,"Robin has done it again! Someone gave me the Revival I and II Cds. I loved them (especially Revival I), and I never for a moment thought I'd find any music that is equal to them. But I have: East Of The River and Come Heal This Land, both by Robin Mark. These albums are at least as good!!! The more I listen, the more I love them. Buy them! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!"
4,One of the Best Worship Albums Ever,"Although ""Revival in Belfast"" remains the standard of worship albums, this one is still great. Robin Mark's style reminds me of Van Morrisson during Van's ""Christian phase."""
1,12 foot cord in 25ft box,What a ripoff!!!!!! I paid for a 25ft cord and they sent me a 10-12ft in a 25ft box. No way is this going to work!!!!! I will try to send it back but be aware this is definitly not a 25ft cord. try another company.....
5,Tastes like Syrian food,"Overall, recipes are easy to follow; only exception are the cheese recipes. The recipes for cheese lack sufficient detail (I.e. Temperatures of milk). I've attempted to make cheese following the instructions with no success. The other recipes have pleased the palette of my Syrian Allepian husband."
3,So very cute,This book is heartwarming and cute. All of these coffee table animal books are about the same. This one was no different. The pictures are adorable the writing is mediocre.
5,Every page is cool!,"This book is very good I just can't stop reading it, every page is cool. It has a lot of action and twists and turns to keep one your feet. I think this is the best on so far!"
5,"""Nami,my love!!""","Awsome,funny,exciting,insterting,what else can I put for it?All I got to say is...It was the funnist book I've ever read!!!!!!It was amazing!!!!!!It was soooooooo...GREAT!!!!!!!With a capital G-R-E-A-T!!!!!!!I couldn't stop smiling of laughter!!!!!""Nami,my love!!""(quoting Sanji.)that's soooo funny!!!!!I think Sanji is the funnist person in the book!!!!And he also loves another girl named Roxxanne?!!!!Ah,come on!!!!!What a ladies man!!!!!!!Also,Zolo was really brave and couragess agiants Mihawk.I'm surpriesed.He wasn't even afraid to die!!Now that's courage!!!But man!!!!!Sanji is the best!!!!!!!I reapet:Sanji is the BEST!!!!!!!!With a capital B-E-S-T!!!!!!!!Ok,I'm done."
