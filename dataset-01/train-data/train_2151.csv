4,La momia desaperece,"This is a good intermediate learning spanish book. It has vocab on the side of the page, which keeps you away from your spanish-english dictionary, a very good thing. This is part of a trilogy, all of which are comic detective novels with history bytes in the story. A fun read for a third year spanish student, ar second year for a very advanced class."
2,Dated and disappointing.,I really enjoyed the author's later book Rebecca's War so I had high hopes for this. It's just a very dated picture of a girl who doesn't really know who she is. I think it's worth reading only to see how far we've progressed from the attitudes of these shallow characters. The author really grew tremendously as a writer after this.Update: My nine-year-old daughter read it and liked it.
2,Not great past 4 months,"My son did fine in this tub until he was old enough to want to sit up. He is constantly pulling himself forward out of the reclined newborn side. We have tried to put him on the straight up infant/toddler side, but because he is still a supported sitter, he falls forward alot. Also, on the straight up side there is NO PADDING and his tail bone presses into the hard plastic (the one time we tried this side he came out of the bath with a big red make on his tailbone!). We are in the process of looking for a new tub."
4,great for large babies,"Our baby, at 5 months, is the size of a 12-18 month old, and I like this tub a lot, and he seems to like it as well. He is strong, squirmy and wiggly, and he likes to put his feet up and arch his back (think ""bridge"" in yoga), and sometimes he makes it look like he's going to launch himself out backwards and head first. If he were my 1st, I'd be terrified, and probably think the tub design is the culprit, because he does have wiggle room like other reviewers said, but I think at his size this appeals to him. Extra vigilance is a must when bathing a baby anyway, regardless of what tub you choose, and babies like to wiggle! I think I'll be placing him on the toddler side soon, but I like that this grows w/baby. FYI, this was the suggested tub of choice on tallbabystuff.com, which is a great site for choosing stuff for tall babies (and parents), and how I chose other gear to get him too."
5,Better than any other baby bath!,"This is the best baby bath out there. We've tried many, and this simple, inexpensive tub is the best. From brand new born, until toddler age, (just put them in the other direction) it is the easiest, and most comfortable. Even the newest of babies can lean comfortably back in this tub for bathing, and they will grow to love water. Forget the tubs with a sling - the water is at the perfect level for the smallest baby and they enjoy being immersed. Now we have a big toddler, and he'll still sit in it when we put it on the bench of the shower and shower with him."
2,Butt-hurt Newborn.,"If you've got a young baby, expect to be holding their butt up and off of the groove. It has to be so painful while it holds all of their weight."
1,Baby gets cold,"Just bought that as my baby girl outgrew her previous tub, she's just 2 months old but this tub is such a disappointment, no matter whichvside I use mostvof her body is out of the water so she gets cold and shaky, poor thing. It's too bad because she loves bathing. I used it once and am already shopping for a new one, waste of money! I really don't see how any 1 or 2 year old would be comfy in there."
1,Baby's slip n slide,"The tub I bought before this was leaking so I needed a replacement. I ordered this tub based on the positive reviews. Believe me when I say that the leaking tub is a million times better than this. My baby slips and slides whenever she moves. For a wiggley four month old this won't do. She hates the tub as well. She screams and screams when I put her in it. She loves taking bathes in her original tub. This may be because it's her first bathtub or because in this one she slides everywhere and can't get comfy. When the other reviewiers say their babies slide over the middle bump, it's very true! This was a total waste of money since I can't use it. To goodwill it goes!"
2,infant seat rest doesn't work for active babies,"Our 4-month old son likes to kick and push off with his feet, which he does against the toddler side of the tub. This makes him slide down off the infant seatrest and he ends up lying on it with his head at an awkward angle too close to the surface of the water. As another reviewer mentioned, I think the infant seat rest is too slippery to hold a taller baby in the lying position."
5,Useful!,"We've used this tub with our son as long as he's been able to have ""real baths"" (not sponge baths.) We only used the hammock-type sling that came with the tub one time, because he got too cold too quickly. Our son is now 4 months old and still loves this tub. He loves splashing around in it. It is also nice that he can still fit on the ""newborn"" side and we don't really have to worry about him falling down into the water because of the seat. We use the extra little basin for clean water for rinsing."
5,Just what you need,"My daughter is only 3 months old but she is really enjoying this tub. I chose this one after much researching since it seemed to be the best for the price range and did not have the ""bump in the middle"" issue that other tubs seem to have.She used the hammock when she was a couple of weeks old and it made it very easy to sponge bathe her since, as new parents, we felt very awkward with a little newborn in our hands and this made bathing her a little less scary. As soon as we could we sat her in the newborn side, though, because the sling keeps her whole body out of the water and cold (I suggest placing a washcloth over baby's chest,and to keep it wet with warm water during her bath so she does not get cold. We still do that.). Now she's splashing around like a pro!It's easy to drain the water out and the built-in ""pocket"" is handy for keeping the baby soap and shampoo."
3,There is no sling included in this product,"A lot of reviews for this product here highly praised the hammock or the sling. I expected to get one when I ordered this product. However, there is no bath sling in the box and I double checked the product description and it specifically mentions ""there is no bath sling with this item"". So be careful when you read the reviews."
3,It's okay,"When we first got this tub, we loved it, especially the infant sling! The sling was easy to clean and change the water. But as our daughter got bigger, the tub would slide around in the big tub when we'd lift her up to clean under her (around 18 months old). So we just moved her to the regular tub after that.However...as time when on, a layer or scum built up around the ""legs"". I couldn't find a cleaning instrument that would fit down there to clean it out! I tried scum sprays and tried q-tips. So it could use it's own scrubbing brush just for those hard-to-reach areas! I'm looking at other models for my second child."
4,Practical and fun,"Our tub had a sling with it and it worked great for the first two months or so. After that we removed the sling, because baby was out growing it, the tub was still quite functional and wonderful! The tub is perfectly sized, it's not too heavy to move out of the way for storing. This tub makes bath-time fun and safe - our baby is always comfortable - except when daddy slips and gets water in her eyes, but you can't blame the tub for that!"
2,Don't love it...,"I thought this was a model that I had purchased many years ago fro my last child, and it turns out to have changed. It is awkward to place in the kitchen sink, and is odd to place the baby in. My daughter is still quite small, so it may get better the larger she becomes, however, in comparison to other tubs that I have owned, this is by far the worst."
3,"Safe, But Unnecessary","This is a great product. It is safe, easy to clean and drain, but completely unecessary if your baby enjoys playing in the bathtub with the parent. Our baby has only used this tub for a couple occasions where he had a complete diaper blowout and it was easier to put him in this than jump in the tub or shower with the poopy baby.Now we mostly use this for messy art projects with our infant."
2,May be fine for some...,"I just never got the hang of this tub, my big boy always winded up sliding around on the slick surface."
5,"my baby love it, great for first time mom","we been using this tud for my baby since she is 4wks old , she love the tud, and the baby can be very safe in the tud ,her head is always above the water, so there is no water going in to her ear.she love the tud so much , everytime when we get her out, she start to cry, and if we put her back in , she stop .great price , good for first time mom ."
2,Not worth it,"I received this tub as a shower gift and thought ""how neat!!"" In reality though my baby hated it and screamed everytime I tried to use it. The infant sling holds them too far out of the water and they freeze. I did like the extra place for rinse water and the drain stopper that changes colors if the water is too hot though."
5,Fits EVERYTHING & looks so CLASSY!,"I love this high-qualtity bag, I feel bad for those who want it, as it's no longer in stock . . ."
3,Bought as gift,Bought as a gift for my parents. They enjoyed the album very much and reminisced about days gone by. Listen to it often
4,"Overall, an interesting CD...","The Tales from the Edge series was a group of 11 CDs put out by local radio station KDGE from around 1990-1996. TFTE 9-10 was actually released in March of 1995.As for these CDs, the first is a snapshot of some of the bands of that time. The second is a retro CD of bands from Dallas that date in the mid 1980's. Notable on the first CD is the Nixons, a band that did make a splash in that time. Later on, their lead singer, Zac Malloy, would go on to have success in his own solo career.Notable on the second CD is the New Bohemians, a.k.a. Edie Brickell and the New Bohemians. Additionally, there's Three on a Hill, whose lead singer, Peter Schmitt, went on to a band named Funland. Oddly enough, I've heard a lot of TOA songs, and this one is probably the worst of them all.Overall, the CD is enjoyable if you like local stuff. Otherwise, you'd be turned off.Since this CD was in very limited release only in Dallas in 1995, copies are very hard to find these days."
2,Catherine Bates,I'm pretty sure this film isn't forin (foreign even). This is about as Hollywood as they come. Ither/eather... jonra.... geez that's painful to read.
4,Not bad,"I liked the location and the Irish flavor added to this movie, and there were many funny parts. I did squirm a little over the predictable parts, and there were several, but it wasn't that bad. It's the basic story of 'bad boy' getting a break, getting the girl, etc. I did like the acting and the 'fish out of water' plot. I was looking for a surprise ending, but didn't get one.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
3,"Cute movie, but been there, done that.","Irish Jam is a cute story, pretty well written, and pretty well acted, and filmed in a beautiful locale.It is the story of a con man who goes gooey, and buys his own con, or goes good, depending on your perspective (The Music Man, Curley Sue etc, etc.). A fatherless child sees the good in a hustler that no one else can sense, and then changes his life. There are some funny parts, lots of stereotypes, a far fetched romance, and a happy ending.All in all, not a bad way to spend an hour and a half."
1,Very possibly the worst movie ever,"This movie was beyond bad. The story, the predictable stereotypical characters...it all came together to make a horrible film. I'm not a big fan of Eddie Griffin but he was especially bad in this, but you can't really blame him with that god-awful script. Any stereotypical, peculiar white/black un-funny lines you can think of was in this movie. I can't begin to go into depth about how much I loathe this movie, I'm choking on my own rage here!"
1,Do not waste your money,"This film had a good story line. What killed it was the Eddie Griffin who could not act his way off a set of stairs and a total lack of story telling from the director and the editor. If the production company would have left the grips, food service, make-up and just folks standing around watching it being filmed, in charge of the direction and editing it would have been better. Dumping Eddie it could have been great.There were some great performances from the supporting cast, but it was all overshadowed from the lack of continuity of the story line and ego from the main character."
3,Technical but Good Stuff!,"This book is loaded with lots of good principles of Bible interpretation but is ""heavy"". Scholars and serious BIble students will enjoy and benefit from it but the beginning study will have a hard time wading through all the detail.Definitely worth while reading and having as a reference tool in any serious student's library."
2,Tube failure - not so great,"I have one of these in my 'earthquake' pack which stays in my vehicle 24/7. Perhaps it was the heat, perhaps it was a defect, but the tube connections at the bite valve and bag ""melted"". The tube was ok, the bag and bite valve were ok, but the stuff that connects the tube to them was a gooey sticky mess.No problem I thought, I'll get a replacement tube. I challenge anyone reading this review who doesn't work for MSR to get a replacement tube for this bag. Apparently it can't be done. So if any part of the fails you buying a whole new bag. That isn't reasonable in my opinion. Sigh."
5,Finally! A sturdy hydration bladder...,"I hesitated in buying this because it is quite a bit more expensive than comparable bladders. However, the bladder is made of nylon fabric that seems to be EXTREMELY sturdy. I've filled it up several times now almost to 3/4 full and frozen it. The cap does freeze shut so I take it out about 10 minutes prior to filling it the rest of the way with water. Now I have cold water for at least 12 miles into a run. That's very nice.The drawbacks:The mouthpiece does take some getting used to as the flow is lower than other bags.The tubing at the bottom cannot be removed without water escaping from the bag (if this is what you're looking for, the Hydrapak reversible has this feature.I'm definitely going to switch to this bag since the material will withstand more abuse than plastic only bladders."
3,"Good bag, needs a better hose.","I had to buy this bag to fit an MSR filter that would not fit on my camelbak. I like this bag but did not like the hose or mouthpiece. So I pulled off the tube, cut off my camelbak hydrolok tube and put it on the MSR bag, now its perfect."
4,Tough hydration bladder,I ordered two of these and they both leaked under pressure (in a full pack) or when laid flat. I was very dissapointed in that.Updated 8/30/2012 Increased from two to four stars - After discovering they were leaking I threw them in a bin of junk. last month I ran across them again and called MSR. They paid shipping to have me return the bladders to them and they sent me out two new ones after looking them over. I never received an explanation as to why they leaked but the new ones didn't. They are good quality bladders. I now prefer CamelBak's Omega bladders but wouldn't hesitate to use these if I had to.
4,Good product for burning discs,Glad to see that Memorex is stocking the dual layers in 50 packs finally. Would like to see some competition in the DVD r Dual Layer market.
1,I WON'T be buying Memorex any more!,"Creating a DVD, using iMovie to iDVD EVEN on a PowerMac G5 Quad (superfast, supergreat!) is a 4-5 hour process. A 10-15% FAILURE rate, due to POOR media quality is UNACCEPTABLE! The 'quality control' at MEMOREX sucks!It is NOT so much the cost of the bad DVDs, but, there are superficial scratches on the recording surface of 5-8 out of every 50 I have used, causing a failure to burn, after a VERY lengthy set up process.I will be using VERBATIM blank media . .FROM NOW ON!"
5,Very reliable,"Before I could use these I had to update my drive's firmware, but since then I've had no problems. After forty burns or so, the failure rate's about one in twelve, no worse than with other media I use. I'm satisfied enough with these discs that I've already ordered another spindle."
3,Too Many Bad Disks,IT is cheap but I find that about 20% of the disks are bad. Very cheap quality unbecoming for a company like Memorex.
5,Just as I Imagined,"Picking up this book was a trip into my Texas past. A glimpse of a rarified style of life that I pined for as a girl growing up in Grand Prairie....I don't think we had a Junior League. ""Just As We Were"" actually proves again, that no matter the side of the tracks you came from, Texas women are a singular breed, smart, strong, and committed"
2,disappointing,"I found this book to be disappointing - it didn't live up to the hype of the other three reviews. The chapters about summer camps, the Hockaday private school, sororities, and Junior League were interesting but the rest was disappointing. I guess maybe you need to be from Texas to appreciate the rest, but as a northerner I was looking for more along the lines of the four chapters I mentioned above."
2,Does not cover what is on Exam 70-100,"This book is better than the Sybex book by Ben Ezzell, and it is better than the Syngress Media book, but it still bears little resemblence to the actual exam.This is probably more Microsoft's fault, since this book does cover the exam objectives from Microsoft's web site.Microsoft should have made this the MCDBA Core exam instead of the MCSD Core exam. The exam is about 75% DBA related.The best prep for this exam is the new Transcender Solution Cert 3.0 Beta, which they just released this week.I managed to pass the exam this morning with a score of 879, but not because of this book."
1,Does not prepare you for the actual exam,70-100 is not a multiple choice question exam. It use case study and mostly database design. This book with true/false question will not prepare you with the actual exam.
3,NOT THAT BAD,"This book isn't the greatest book to get to study for the exam, but it gives you a great summary and overview. The book is probably good to read through after you have gone through the full version SYBEX offers."
4,"i actually rate it 3 and a half, but that wasn't an option","I LOVE the Mrs. Murphy books - the only reason i brought this one down a little is cuz i found it to be more boring than the others. however, i could find it boring just because i'm younger. In general, it was good."
1,Mickey Finns anyone?,"The closest Rita will ever get to emulating ""Murder, She Wrote"" is in the title of this book. The similarities end there. Anyone can write about the illicit drug trade, a subject Rita should have had the good sense to stay away from. She added nothing to the discussion worth reading. And she still doesn't know what she is talking about when it comes to law enforcemnt."
4,Murder Then and Now.,"Is this old murder from 1803 connected to the new one that just occurred in present day Crozen? Harry and her friends think so, so they begin to dig deep into old records and letters to find out what the connection could be. Can some knowledge be that great that it covers two centuries? Apparently so because it appears that someone really wants some old secrets kept secret. I enjoyed this book actually more than the previous two because I found that the two murders separated by almost 200 years were very well connected by the author. I still find the ""talking"" done by the animals in this series a little off-putting, but the mysteries are quite good in spite of this."
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK,SO FAR THIS IS THE BEST. I HAVE READ THIS BOOK MANY TIMES. ALSO LET OTHER PEOPLE READ THIS BOOK. I LOVE MRS. MURPHY AND TEE TUCKER. I'M SURE THAT MY CATS AND DOGS TALK TO EACH OTHER JUST LIKE THEY DO.
3,Good,"This book is useful, and if what you need is lists of commands, it will serve your purpose. It is a bit dry, but not more than expected. I believe there are not a huge number of ODS books out there. This one serves its purpose effectively."
3,GREAT LCD PICTURE...TERRBLE AUDIO!!! DON'T BUY!!!,"GREAT CONCEPT , LCD, PAN/TILT BUT....IT IS TOO BAD THEY COUDLN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE A PRODUCT W/O ALL OF THE STATIC AND CRACKING! IT IS HORRIBLE. NOT MUCH GOOD IF YOU HVE TO KEEP THE VOLUME OFF & STARE AT THE PICTURE. I HAVE TRIED ALL OF THE CHANNELS, AND MANY LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT OUR HOUSE AND IT IS ALWAYS VERY LOUD. CAN'T WAIT TO GET A REPLACEMENT AND BE FREE FROM THE NOISE AND INTERUPTIONS AT NIGHT!!! I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT SUMMER INFANTS MONITOR!"
1,Not a baby monitor to buy,This monitor comes in different names but is made by the same manufacturer. Also beware that the newer version that has the greater pan and tilt capability isn't any better. This might be useful as a security monitor if it doesn't leave an a/c outlet for more than an hour and if it sits on a desk that's higher than your body. Issues I found: 1. When I turned on my microwave the speaker screeched and the monitor was unusable. 2. If the monitor was on a table and you walked toward it (within a few feet) the display would go out and the audio would give you a buzzing noise. 3. The pan and tilt feature barely worked- Monitor was downstairs and the camera's upstairs. Less than 60 ft. I had to go upstairs to get them to work. (I don't have wireless or a 2.4 GHz phone) 4. The volume control was extremely touchy. It went from 0 to loud with barely a touch. I liked the concept but the product needs some tweaking for it to be a baby monitor.
3,for what it is,"First off you have to know that even though this thing has pan and tilt does not mean it is high tech. It is not truely wireless either, the camera has to be plugged in to power. I will say that it come in handy for keeping an eye on the little ones especially the pan and tilt. If you have the extra money spend it on a better one if not well you see what i have said"
5,Perfect is a standard from DAN GIBSON,"This is a very relaxing, peaceful product. I have other bird song products from DAN GIBSON. All of his products deserve the money you pay."
4,"Beautiful, Flawed Product","The earrings themselves are beautiful, and they shipped right on time. The packaging was perfect, and my mother loved them for her birthday present.However, one of the earrings had a scratch across the entire front of the earring that was very obvious. I am returning them, and I hope I can get a new pair without blemishes because these earrings truly are gorgeous. (This scratch and the fact that I have to return them to get new ones is why I only gave it 4 stars)Great product--Just make sure you look closely at each earring when you receive them to ensure there are no marks or blemishes."
5,Best jewelry on the planet,"I checked out these earrings for months before I purchased them. Boy, was I dumb to wait! These earrings exceeded my high expectations! They are absolutely gorgeous! These are my new go-to earrings & I have lots! I have never seen earrings that sparkle & shine like Lillith Star! Fantastic value for the price! I couldn't wait to order more! They were shipped quickly and in gift giving quality packaging! I will be a long time customer!"
2,not as good as it looks,"They did not look as good as they did online. They were also supposed to be for non-pierced ears, but the clasp was extremely painful and dug into the earlobe. I bought these for my wedding and will NOT be wearing them."
4,"Sweet, Interesting and Entertaining","A really cute time travel adventure. Fun, sexy Highlander who keeps you entertained throughout. A good fantasy to take you away on a fun filled adventure in a quick easy read."
1,"A Good Attempt, but does not quite work.","I bought this book last week. Normally I love Time Travel books based in Scotland (I'm Scottish and live in Scotland). But, unfortunately I am rapidly going off this book. I don't really know what is wrong with it, it's not grabbing my attention as some other books have. I have no feeling for the characters in any shape or form. For all I care 'they could go and hing themselves from the nearest lamp-post'. One thing that has really annoyed me is that Claire Cross has tried to be clever and have the hero coming forward in time and therefore change history. The Scots lost Bannockburn, Robert the Bruce is branded as a thief and scoundrel and England (which she insists on calling Britain!!) lords over Scotland. HEY! Maybe that's why I don't like the book!!No, to be honest this could have been an excellent story, but to me it is wasted by an author who doesn't have the talent for this type of story."
3,"Editor, please!","If I didn't know better, I would think this was a first-time author. The first 70% of the book dragged on forever. I finished it because I love ""Time-Travel"" books and love to read, however the typos on almost every page made it difficult to maintain continuity. Had to go back and figure out what the word/sentence was supposed to be before moving on; very distracting. Better editing would have made this book more enjoyable. I hope this was not a result of being an ""e-book"" vs a ""hard copy"""
1,A wasted plot...,"I have just recently started reading this style of novel and have read some really great ones and I was so excited when I bought this one. However, I reached a point where I could barely read through this one. The story line has so much potential, the hero is great but the heroine!The heroine is as thick as cold grits,childish, churlish,clumsy,petty, unfair.... to the point of being so annoying I couldn't stand her dialogue.I wish someone else could use the exact same story line and put in a woman with a character I can admire.. some backbone and decency and the dialogue of a grown woman not some simpering dialogue that would annoy even a 12 year old."
4,Scottish history and time travel all rolled up into one!,I loved this book.....like I said in my summary..that made it perfect....I loved how the author managed to make Alasdair depart at the crucial moment.....Yummm
3,predictable,I enjoy escaping into my books.This was easy enough to do in this book but alas.........predictable all the way to the ending.If your reading to just pass the time this is the book.
3,Kind of boring....,"I am a true fan of Scottish/Highland romances, and I've gotta say....this was actually and surprisingly boring...I fell asleep reading it..and believe me...I am an avid reader, and falling asleep in the first chapter is not good...."
3,Good enough to pass OCP,"I was scared on seeing other reviews before taking the exam.Though the book has lot of errors, it is sufficient to pass the 9i new features exam."
2,Not bad to read,"I bought this book, selftest software. I also bought oracle9i new features. I noticed lot of errors in the quiz part of the book. I sent the errors to the author, who never replied back. I also sent the questions to BFQ software who made the quiz cd. Bruce at bfq said his inability to correct the answers as the liablty agreement with publisher is too tough. What ever, I passed my exam reading this book, oracle9i new features, and oracle documentation."
2,Who edited this thing?,"I have 8 years of Oracle experience and have completed all the certifications since v7.3. I have been waiting for a book to help prepare for the 9i upgrade exam so I was happy to finally get this book. I'm halfway through reading it and have found more errors than I have fingers to count. I'm no editor so the errors I have found are blatant and it makes me nervous as to how many subtle errors there are that I missed and thereby got misinformation. The content seems ok but it is annoying to know you spent money for a book that has information you cannot trust. Wait for the next publishing, maybe the errors will be cleared up by then."
4,Good preparation for the ORACLE9i new features exam,Yesterday I passed the test with 49 of 56 correct questions at least partly thanks to this book. Together with the test questions from selftestsoftware and the ORACLE documentation you should be able to pass the test.I found that this book covers all of the topic that I found in my exam. However sometimes it misses some minor details that might be needed in the exam (1 of the 7 questions that I answered wrongly was such a case). I you are aiming for a perfect score in the exam this is not the book but I think a perfect score in a test that you only need to pass should not be the goal of test preparation...I will use (and already used) this book as a reference for my work with ORACLE9i new features.
1,"Long on promise ,Short on delivery","I have been around Oracle as an OCP since release 7 and i have to say this is one of the worst books i have read,or should i say, tried to read!The explanations are meanderingly ambiguous and the structure leaves a lot to be desired.If your reading this i suggest that you seek alternative sources of information for your exam preparation!"
1,Was this book proof read?,"So many mistakes - the exam questions and answers contradict what is in the chapters, and Oracle documentation completely.It is a shame the publisher / author hasn't released a corrections bulletin.I've but lots of corrections in mine - I'm temped to ask for a refund."
2,OCP Oracle9i Database: New Features for Administrators,"Absolutely,no good for an only source material to pass the test. Many errors in the book. Sample tests are not representative of the real test. As a tool to be certified certainly is a very disappointing one. Probably can be used as reference.Regards :-|."
2,"A good book, but not for exam preparation","This book covers almost everything new in Oracle9i, but it doesn't focus on exam, it covers details, but not to the point. For general readings, this book is fine, I won't expect to rely on this to pass Oracle9i upgrade exam. I was disappointed when I received it and viewed the contents."
3,Good for study guide,"This book is good as a study guide, but you HAVE to go more deeper with the official documentation and exercise the topics with a real database. I just passed the test and it was only because I studied the topics in much further detail. It is also based on release 1 not on current release 2. It has several mistakes but easy to discover, you have to crosscheck with the documentation. But the book is a good guide, otherwise the scope of study would be too big."
3,"Well, it works. A kind of ..","I just passed the test and I think it is possible to pass the test using only this book for preparation. However, I wouldn't rate the book too high. The language is really boring. It wouldn't be ok for documentation, but not good for teaching. To make life harder, the book and the supplied CD contain mistakes. Once you've found a few, you can't trust the book anymore and have to double check the info you're not sure about. It really makes your experience miserable.However, all questions I had at the test were covered in the book so the content is adequate, it's just the presentation is bad."
3,"Good reference, with some errors..","This book can be used as a reference along with Oracle Documentation. I passed the exam using studying from both. If you really want to learn(and not just certify), the best option is to go through 9i documentation.Well, I would say this book certainly served its purpose, as it is just a ""Certification"" guide."
3,Good Reference But don't Completely Rely Only on this,"I just Passed the OCP-9i Upgrade Exam .I Mostly relied on this book.After the exam i'm realising that,i should have read Documents parallely.So if you are planning to take OCP,put equal or MORE effort to read the Documents...About OCP : You will get More multiple choice questions than earlier exams...so time will be a costraint...Best of Luck for the exam..."
1,I passed--barely,"While the book does an adequate job of covering the new features, there were many errors in the chapter quizzes, practice exams and on the CDROM quizzes. I wouldn't recommend buying the book if I had to do it over again. I would read the new features summary in the Oracle Documentation set and browse the checklist for the exam (from the Oracle Ed website). Overall, the best preparation I had was by attending some new features sessions at the IOUG conference in April. I passed, but probably could have passed as well without this book."
4,Funny Millicent,"Millicent is your basic clueless but likeable brainiac. Don't be put off by the first chapter and Millicent's writing in Latin. It just goes to show how different her humor is.I also like the idea of two other books about her friends, Stanford and Emily. I haven't read them yet but want to see what their point of view of Millicent is.In the interest of full disclosure (and so you can see where I'm coming from) I have to say I am a grandmother and an English tutor."
5,"""Brillant"" Book- A Great read!","I LOVED this book. At first, I thought this book was okay, but as Millicent ( Also know as Millie ) Takes up some ""I'm a regular 11 year old girl"" sports and actually meets a girl named Emily. Even though they are different, Millicent and Emily are bound to be friends. But Millie doesn't tell her she's in college.- I reccomend this book for ages 5- ??. It was a great price for a thick book... about 280 pages... I got mine for 4.99 :)"
5,Mrs. Gowin Rules!,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It made me laugh; it made me cry. It made me see things through the eyes of a young person again. Millicent, blessed and cursed with being a child genius, needs something that we all take for granted -- a friend. When Millicent thinks she has finally found someone, Emily, who is willing to be her friend she stops at nothing to keep her friendship going. Meanwhile, she's forced into tutoring the one person with whom she doesn't want to be friends, Stanford. To further complicate matters, Emily and Stanford develop a romantic relations of their own that makes for some interesting plot twists and ironic scenes. In the end, Emily finds true friendship, although in the place she least expected to find it. Henrietta Gowin, my favorite character, really has little to do with the story but that name, Henrietta Gowin, rings of sophistication. Her character must have been inspired by an exceptional person."
4,"Millicent Min, Girl Genius","I defiantly give this book a 4.5 rating. I loved it! Lisa Yee's unique writing style really kept me hooked the whole way! The storyline was humorous and filled with surprises. . Millicent Min won the Sid Fleischman Humor Award which is awarded to a book with outstanding writing in the genre of humor. I could not agree more, I laughed like crazy throughout this whole book. I especially recommend this to teens in grades 6 through 8 and for anyone who is looking for a great read! Claire. St. John's School Houston, TX"
4,great reference.,This book was recommended by my ENG 101 Instructor and is great for everyday reference.
2,Book was delivered fast.,"I was surprised how fast I recieved it. However the book was not in the best condiition, but it will get the job done and the price I paid was worth it."
3,It was okay,Got this book for class. It was okay it helped me understand writing a lot better. I think if you have to buy this book I would buy it on Amazon.
2,Immaculee's CD,"This CD was interesting and enhances her book ""Left to Tell"" by actually visiting Rwanda, her homeland. However, I give it a low grade only because I was looking for more information on the spiritual elements of her heart-wrenching story. So by that measure, my expectations were not met. I can only say that the whole of her story -- the factual and spiritual -- as told in her book will live with me forever. Very powerful."
5,Good read,"Very well written, as objective as possible, and engaging. Good anthropological approach for contemporary cultures. Couldn't put it down, and sad when it ended...I wanted to know more."
5,Well written personal account turned into an adventure,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. The author has done such an amazing job at narrating his personal experience that it makes the reader feel like he is part of it. His descriptive account of his entire journey makes you want to go there and join the caravan. With a hint of suspense, he does a good job at luring the readers to read the entire book. The book, itself, is easy to read written in a simple language."
4,A worthwhile journey,"I was taking a course in the Geography of Africa and decided to do some outside reading and picked up this book. Michaels descriptions of his journey through the Sahara to the salt mines in Taoudenni with an azalai salt caravan and his guides brought you into the story. He gives historical information and cultural insight, at times quite graphic, from a respectful perspective. He was there to learn and is not afraid to laugh at his own follies. A worthwhile read."
4,Well worth reading,"This was a good read from front to back and was certainly well written. The only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars is that the author left out a few explanations throughout the book that seemed strange. For instance there isn't a single word about what it was like to go over 30 days without a shower, whereas the fact that he's going to break up with his girlfriend gets a complete paragraph. A few little examples like that are my only gripe, but I did enjoy the book."
3,Not as good as I had Hoped,"The book is not very appealling to look at, it certainly doesn't inspire a person. However it has a lot of practical information. A book to put away and pull out when you need to refresh your mind on certain measurements."
1,Disappointment in Well Known Name,"I ordered this product 3 times.....the first two times I received the product, it was ""cracked"" in two critical areas. I was sent a new replacement each time....by the third time....the ""quality of the item"" was still ""very, very poor."" I got tired of sending the old back and so on and so forth....and I just kept the ""broken product."" I would not recommend this product to any one...first off of the very poor quality, second of all the ""foot print"" it takes on your working desk, and lastly due to the quality of the product....it will ""fall apart"" before you get full use out of it............is it worth the $30 I paid???......no ...no....no. Please, save yourself alot of trouble.....don't purchase it."
4,Perfectly happy,"Contrary to the naysayers - this product arrived in good condition, I had no difficulty assembling it, the knobs (continue to) do what they are supposed to do and I love it. So much so that I'm buying another for my home office. It is not a bullet-proof product, it does need a little care in manipulating it but I intend to have it on my desk for a long time."
1,Chexy,"Where do I start? I bought the ""Used-mint"" copyholder from ""rom1616."" When I got it, the box was collapsing, there was no packing inside, and knobs and nuts and parts were lying in the bottom of the box. The pivoting arm and base were cracked in several places. The weights in the bottom of the base were loose and partially hanging out of the bottom as though it had been dropped. I couldn't get any of the parts to tighten up as the screws had been stripped out. The sliding ruler was missing completely (one of the parts I truly needed). When I tried to stand it up, the copy tray and rotational arm flopped forward exposing the multiple cracks in the plastic where the base and arm join. I have never been this disgusted over a purchase of an office item. Unfortunately, there was not an option for rating this product of ""no star."" In my opinion, either do not buy this product or do not buy from rom 1616. A nightmare I do not wish to visit again."
3,Too long and bloody for me.,"I get tired during these epic adventure novels, and in this one, there are too many violent and bloody episodes. I did love the philosophy the author imparts, but he doesn't learn the lessons he's imparting. Maybe that will come in the sequel that is sure to come. I won't be reading it."
5,excellent read. book is too long for my personal taste,I find this book very interesting and enligtening. I cannot put it down. The problem is it is so long I cannot finish it. When does Linbaba hook up with Karla. They are dragging it out to the end.It is a wonderfully written novel and informative to boot.I recommend it highly.
5,A Literary Masterpiece,Best prose I've ever seen from an ex prisoner. Raises the big questions in philosophy in the context of a gripping story layered with literary flourishes. I couldn't put it down and read all 936 pages in less than 2 weeks.Shaun Attwood
5,"Great novel, but not original.","Gregory David Roberts borrows heavily from another Roberts, ie., Paul William Roberts. If you have read his(Paul William's) non-fictional account of India in his stupendous travelogue ""Empire of the Soul"", you would find many uncanny resemblences. That trip to Afghanistan and the descriptions of sorrounding areas, St. Xavier's miraculous preservation and even the general description of Bombay. Not to take anything away from Gregory David's fine novel, but the other Roberts(Paul William's) is outstanding in his description of India. He combines history, philosophy and travel into a gripping personal account that is far more scholarly without being pretentious. Try to get hold of that other book and see for yourselves the fresh insight that you would automatically get from ""Shantaram""."
5,Amazing Story!,"I picked up this book on a business trip to Myrtle Beach and I could barely put down this book to work! The story line was amazing and the characters so vivid and interesting! Since I've finished the book, I've let my friends pass it around the circle and haven't gotten it back yet (on the 5th friend)!"
5,The Best Book That I Have Ever Read,"All I can say is, This Is The Best Book That I Have Ever Read. It didn't seem that appealing when I first heard about it. I had 3 friends highly recommend it and decided to give it a try. Phenomenal Book, Truly Phenomenal!"
5,amazing account of life in India,The author paints a vivid picture of life in the slums and around Bombay. His autobiographical novel gives the readers privvy to many private places in the city. Word pictures that beg you to come to India and experience its incredible diversity are on every page. It is a long book but I can honestly say I didn't want it to end. It's been a very long time since I felt that way about any book. I hope Mr. Roberts will present us all with another fine book in the future.
4,"Book is great, but most of the 2 star reviews are accurate","Personally I liked it, although I agree with the majority of the 2 star reviews. I gave it 4 stars because I thought it was entertaining to read - although the first 200 and last 100 pages were a bit winded."
5,Magic Carpet Ride,"This novel is a magic carpet ride of the highest quality. The characters are so vibrant that you can almost see them leap off of the page. I was extremely pleased with the story-line - a bit fantastical, but entertaining to the end. I found myself really feeling for the characters and relationships that I witnsessed. Sex, drugs, religion, combat, and a glimpse into the Middle East - how appropo to current events! I highly reccomend this book to all."
5,The best book nobody ever heard of,The best book nobody ever heard of. I thought descriptions of Mumbai slums and underworld were terrific reading. Recommend for anyone who likes to read for pleasure and better under standing of the world in which we live.
5,Read it!,"At last. A life lived largely. A Jack London life. A book that takes on the big gun questions and answers (or lack thereof). No glorificaton of domestic boredom and the long winded whine of its consequences. This story blew me away. Hands down the best book I've read in the past five years, and one of the best I've ever read in my life. I am enlarged, changed by, and grateful for the journey it took me on, and can't wait to read it over and over."
5,best book i've read since midnight's children,i read it 2 months ago and now i'm walking around bookshops looking for my next book. you will never read a book like this....an incredible life told truly and the standard of writing ranks with literature....but enjoy every page becauseit is going to be impossible to replicate....a book that will stay with you for a very long time...BRAVO!
2,little depth,"This was a book with many action scenes and changes of pace. this was the only thing that kept me reading. I found the main character repetitive and annoying, there was always some new skill being revealed or discovered, hard to believe."
4,Shantaram review,"I enjoyed the book and would recommend it. Well written, painting a vivid picture of India. Many thought provoking passages."
4,Rang true to what I remember of living in India.,"I enjoyed this book very much because our family lived in India for many years and so it all rang true. However, I hated the part of the book where Shantaram goes off to Afghanistan. It was just over the top and I, quite frankly, am tired of the early days of the Taliban and anything written about it."
5,Great book about Indian culture and insight...,"After many trips to India, I still found this book enlightening about what it's like to live there.I loved the juxtaposition of the weathlier lives and poorer lives, as well as the real life story of the author."
2,Glad to be finished reading this pointless book,"My sister raved that Shantaram was the BEST book that she had ever read. So, I excitedly bought the book and started reading. Was there something I just didn't get? It took me about 2 years of picking up and putting down the book, and thank goodness, I finally finished it tonight! I persevered because I hoped the book would get better, and then more recently it became a good practice book for my speed reading.Lots of pointless stories that barely tie together by an author who is in desperate need of a good editor to stop the rambling on for 935 pages."
3,Overblown,Couldn't finish this one. May go back to it at some point but it became quite tedious and was so overwritten.
1,shantaram,this book is in poor shape. it's a gift for someone and it's not presentable. i cannot recommend this company
2,Felt filthy after reading this one.,"""This is the first time I finished a novel and felt filthy for having read it - not because of the setting, but because of the characters. Criminal scum trying to rationalize away their own amoral approach to life.Dr. Jekyll in this Jekyll-Hyde story pulls you into the bowels of Bombay in its first third. The main character, Lin, an escaped armed robber, is discovering his soul in Bombay's slums and the village of his guide, Prabu. The reader cheers the reforming Lin, but then, in the remainder of the story, Mr. Hyde takes over. Everyone is betrayed, including the reader.Johnny Depp may be fitting for Lin in the first third, but Vin Diesel is a much better fit for the rest."""
1,The Emporer's New Clothes Meets Bombay . . .,"I've rated this book poorly mostly out of irritation with ALL OF YOU who apparently wouldn't know a good book if you were beat over the head with it. Even without all the sheople bleating though, I'd still only give it two stars. Whatever charms this book displays are much better representaed in much better books.Want to know what you're getting in to? Read the *five* star reviews and look for phrases like ""tedious"", ""long winded"", ""self aggrandizing"", and ""stuffy prose"". With these shortcomings mentioned so heavily in the good reviews, how do you think it's going to turn out?That's your first big clue.Think for yourself and consider: If you have to work so hard to plow through an author's drivel to see value, maybe the value is outweighed. Maybe it's not there at all."
3,Help Me I'm Irish!,"It's very Quixotic, with a sort of romantic pathos (my take). The author seems to romanticise about everything (India style) from mafia dudes and prostitutes to homeless, illiterate slum dwellers. I guess I'm a bit too sardonic and iconoclastic to buy that some scumwad mafia don is a spiritual giant to ""his people"" just because the author thinks so.......burp! Also, that an angry, man hating manipulative succubus from Switzerland is the most beautiful woman and has won his heart? I don't think this guy ever got laid much (my take), HA!"
5,A Book to Measure All Other Books By,"What a book! What a story! The characters are as real as your hand in front of your face and you'll want to hop on the next airplane to Bombay (Mumbai), India to drop in at Leopold's to chance a glimpse of the old gang.....This book will rip your heart out, stomp on it, and put it back in your chest all repaired by the ending. It took me a week to read and it was the best week of my life. I cried when it was over and haven't been able to read another book since. Truly an epic masterpiece."
5,Shantaram,This is one on the most enthralling books I have ever read. I do not recall ever being so immersed in a culture as I was with this book. The author writes prose like it is poetry. The autobiographical aspects of the book illuminate an amazingly interesting individual.Shantaram (HARDCOVER)Shantaram: A NovelShantaramShantaram
3,"Loved the first half, hated the 2nd half","I thought this book had a lot of potential. I actually started reading this book while travelling in India so loved all the references and anecdotes about India. However, somewhere in the middle of the book, it wasn't about India anymore and turned into this far fetched action movie. I did find the author very pretentious in his references to Lin (himself), fluent in Hindi and Maharathi, expert in martial arts, philosopher, poet and genuine super hero. Meanwhile, he is working for the mafia. The long winded poet descriptions got very tiresome and the plot became very predictable. Overall, it was an interesting read but I was so happy to not have to read it anymore by the end."
1,"Book gets 5 stars, Kindle version gets 1 star","The Kindle version of this book needs some serious editing. The book must have been scanned then OCR'ed because there are typos on almost every page, some pages have many. This is usually only irritating, but occasionally I have to reread a sentence several times to parse out where the periods or other punctuation should be. It's especially irritating that one of the main characters of the book is named Karla and this can come up as Karia, Kar1a, Kar|a, or who knows how many other variations. These problems really interrupt the flow and joy of reading this book. It's a really bad version.The exact same problems appear on both the dedicated Kindle reader and the iPhone Kindle application so I don't think it's a download problem.The book itself is spectacular and I highly recommend it for all the reasons given in the other reviews."
3,Enjoyed the first 400 pages,Then it skipped the shark. I loved being transported to India. I didn't understand the character's motivation to fight and belong to a terrorist group.
2,A story worth telling - by someone else,"I can't deny that Mr Roberts has a story to tell. I just wish it had been written by someone else, someone whose prose style isn't so flowery and cliche-ridden. I can't believe the praise that has been heaped on this book. Have these people ever read a truly well-written novel ? Roberts never uses one word when he can use ten. Everything is described in a cloying, 6th form way, all the characters are one-dimensional. I found it plain unreadable."
1,don't bother,"The author's criminal background in itself doesn't concern me, but the extremely poor writing in Shantaram (and web site! and author's fan mail! and philosophical pointers!) strikes me as a successful con job. There is not a single believable character, no depth or complexity in the author's observations, and the narrator's voice wears very thin very quickly. Reading literature is always an option, though: try Vikram Chandra, for instance."
4,Shantaram,"Incredible story with vivid detail and characters. The author's stylistic devices and word choice can become repetitive in the 900+ pages, but the color of the tale makes this an amazing read that will certainly stay with you. The narrator does also come across as a bit self-promoting. Self-deprecation is quickly accepted, but it is just as readily dismissed as if it were trivial."
2,Amazing story - not well told,Gregory focused too much on trying to write a piece of literature; he should have just focused on telling his amazing story.
1,T.E.D.I.O.U.S.,"Seems that most people who reviewed this book negatively made it to at least 200 pages. Well, I barely made it to 100 before deciding that it just isn't worth the pain."
1,Shantaram is a Sham,"A friend recommended this book. She liked so well that when she got to the last page, she started all over again. What seems to impress readers is the lyrical prose that has people swooning over descriptions that do little to move the story along. The author must have written the story and then gone back and put in as many philosophical phrases he could think of. It's a tap dance. He should write poetry. The lengthy and boring descriptions had me skipping pages until I finally gave it up about half way through."
1,tedious at best,"The story line is ridiculous - somewhat of a melange of Rambo and Nora Roberts. This banality is exacerbated by endless pages of navel gazing where the uninspiring and pathetic characters espouse various anarchistic and borderline sociopathic philosophies. The discussion of cosmology by the mafia boss is preposterous on so many levels that it was the funniest part of the book.It is difficult to invest any emotional capital in the primary characters because they have so few (if any) redeeming qualities (I certainly wouldn't want any of them living anywhere near my family).This story should, however, make a profitable movie. It has all of the characteristics Hollywood likes."
1,Shantaram,"I didn't like this book. I bought it because I love stories about India. It's more my fault than the author. Very well written, but the story left me empty."
5,Beautiful Story,"This book was recommended to me by some friends, and I had to call and say ""thank you"" after I finished it because I enjoyed it so much. It is a long read and tells a long, wonderful story with beautifully written characters. I like lots of books but a truly good one is one that makes me laugh out loud, smile as I read it, or sob over some parts. This one did all three. I would especially recommend it to someone who likes to travel."
3,Interesting but slow,"This biography is good and interesting, but not exactly captivating. It's a harder read and I am struggling to get through it. It's one of those books where you want to know what happens but it's an effort to get through. I'd compare it to the Steve Jobs bio."
3,great descriptions of Indian society if they are accurate,"There are facinating descriptions of facts, political situations and institutions in India that make the book worth reading.He is good at describing how it feels to be embroiled in physical violence-at least from my very limited experience with such things.Fortunately, when he goes through one of his long, poorly written descriptions of the local scene, people, emotional interaction or his philosophy of life and the universe, one can quickly see where he is going and skim through several pages at a time.I have read others' reviews praising it for the plot-what plot?"
2,Conned,"Oh, my Lord. Yes, the descriptions of Bombay were good. But I knew by Page 22 (where Lindsay meets Karla) that Roberts is a very immature writer and I would gain little by slogging through the rest of this overwritten, self-regarding mess, except that I had to, for my book club. I did my duty. Now I have to think of something to say, if I'm pressed, that doesn't sound angry. I looked at the photo of Roberts on the back cover of the book. I have no trouble believing he's an ex-con."
3,Exciting for a while,"This book takes off like the Concord, for the first half you'll enjoy one of the most exciting fast paced adventure stories ever written. Then for some unknown reason it runs out of energy.I read the first half in a day including most of the night. Then the book took a turn and in the wrong direction.I still encourage everyone to read this book! But when it gets sluggish walk away happy with the fantastic ride you had until that point.It took me a long time to finish this book.. I kept hoping ""it was going to come back"". Let me save you that little bit of misery, it won't."
3,Pros and cons,"Pros:1. Remarkable story (although it should have been a memoir, not a novel, and should have featured his whole saga, instead of just one small slice of time)2. Wealth of interesting information about Bombay, the slums, criminal organizations (especially passport counterfeiting), Afghan gun-running, and moreCons:1. Way too long, especially in the second half; philosophical sermons repeated ad infinitum; repetitive and boring detail (Roberts was in prison so he had plenty of time on his hands; the publishing house apparently lacked sharp editors);2. The writing, in some places quite good, is elsewhere so overblown as to become farcical3. Pretentious and boastful depiction of the hero; everyone adores this remarkable, larger-than-life fellow4. Wooden, one-dimensional characters, most of them either all good or all evil - where are the shades of gray?"
3,"Worth reading, but I expected better","Given the size of the book, I was expecting an epic, sweeping novel. In that regard I was disappointed. His descriptions of Bombay are very good. It is obvious that he has a deep love of that city. But the narative is so poorly written that it is distracting. It is too bad, because it is a compelling story. For such a large book it reads very quickly and I stuck with it mostly because I wanted to know what happened next. He does have some passages of brilliant prose, but they are few and very far between. When I was done with the book I found myself actually hoping that the movie will be better than the book, which with the right music and good acting it very well could be."
5,"Unforgetable, multidimensional, engrossing","I will never forget this book and when, in a few years, I'll reread it, I will enjoy it just as much, if not more, the second time. I can't wait for that time to come."
2,Struggling to see the fuss .....,"I'm a voracious reader of some intelligence I believe, and have also spent a decent amount of time in India....including the location of this book.I have had Shantaram on my bookshelf for some time, and despite getting quite a way through the book, on repeated attempts was just unable to finish it. I found it boring at times and was unable to get into it. It was ""interesting"" but did not grab me.May give it another go, but struggled.There are better books around I believe. If you're intrigued by India, try A Suitable Boy by Vikram Seth."
5,Beautiful.,"This is my first book review, but I had to write it. My daughter (senior in high school) asked me to purchase this book so she'd have a thick read to last through her week of Spring break. Shantaram is beautifully written. Gregory David Roberts uses masterful prose to bring to life the sights, sounds and scents of India. His writing is infused with emotion that ties you to the characters in his book. Your heart will burst love, ache with sadness, harden with anger and struggle with conflict. We will all read thousands of good books over our lifetime, but very few will be considered great and be one of THE books that you recommend over and over again to your friends, family, coworkers and anyone who appreciates such exquisite writing. Shantaram is such a book. Trust me."
3,a good read and mostly fun,"Oddly, all the reviews here describe the book accurately, both the positive and negative ones. Most however make, to me, the mistake of taking the book seriously. Yes it is unbelievable, and the author has romanticized himself as he wishes to be in some super hero flick, but so what? He does it skillfully, and the reading goes quickly, or else even the negative reviewers would not have read all of it. As light weight books go, this is a lot better than most. Think sort of an attempt to imitate Don Quixote, only that isn't fair to this book, because of course it does not come close. But the continuously flowing sequence of unbelievable but entertaining events is in the same genre. Don't pan it as a bad serious novel or memoir, but as an unusually good light entertainment story. I read it out of order to stay interested, first pages 1-100, then bored I skipped to page 400 or so, then back, and so on. Im on vacation and glad to have it along."
1,"Atrociously-written, self-aggrandizing garbage","My god. What an incredible load of drivel this is. Though there is room in the world for large stories largely told, Gregory David Roberts' self-aggrandazing pseudo-autobiography teems with ludicrously bad prose, characters so flat I'd like to use them to keep water off my bathroom floor, dimwitted philosophy, and self-love. I quite literally had to stop reading from embarassment at the sex scenes (""my body was her chariot and she rode me into the sun""? ye gods), and repeatedly found myself saying, ""No, actually"", at Roberts' increasingly idiotic turns of simile and metaphor even outside that context.Absolute drek."
3,Shantaram review,Fascinating book. His story is amazing and unbelievable. I loved the plot. The writing was tedious at times with cumbersome prose getting in the way and clunky dialogue and tired cliches distracting from the writing. Some of the emotional scenes were maudlin. The action was fantastic and the fast paced pulse of Bombay well captured. The sensuality of the novel was overpowering. I can't wait to see it as a major motion picture.
5,Simply the best,"I grew up in Bombay in the 80s and 90s and now live in Australia. This book took me back to my youth in Bombay. I can see how an Australian would have felt about Bombay in those times.This is an epic thriller- one of the best books I have ever read, reminded me of Papillion and O'Calcutta."
4,"Engaging, with life messages that give you pause","First off I have to say that Shantaram is a bit of a guy's book - like Herman Hesse's Siddhartha. I am female, and not generally a fan of the genre. That being said I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Shantaram. Mr. Roberts can certainly write - but he also made me think. There were several chapter endings that I bookmarked as I knew that I wanted to go back to them and read the ""punchline"" again. Absolutely worth a read."
3,TOO LONG,"While this is an interesting book, great local (India/Bombay)and an interesting author profile, it is nonetheless laborous to read the whole tome."
1,shantaram,A self promotional novel by a drug addict/criminal. This 920 page novel befits the authors oversized ego. After some consideration I think the novel was not worth reading.
2,Portrait of the artist as a clown,"This is indeed a page turner: I was doing five at a time whenever the sex or philosophising started.More generally, the self-styled warrior-poet-healer-entrepreneur who narrates this story is clearly no more than a narcissistic fantasy. Not that I have a problem with loathsome narrators in fiction: Nabokov's Humbert in Lolita is a work of genius. But in this case the effect is unintended. The alleged autobiographical parallels run too deep, and irony is nowhere to be found. So peer into the shallows of this book's abysmal prose and you see a portrait of a very weak person.I am giving it one star on account of some individual passages that actually work, and another because the idea of someone laying bear such a meagre soul in the expectation of praise struck me as novel and comical; ie. entertaining."
1,"Command of Language, But Not Persuasive Enough","The author's command over the language and his writing is nothing short of phenomenal. He doesn't pull any punches describing the abysmal and deplorable conditions in the Indian prison system & his description of their escape from the Australian prison is suspenseful and compelling.Crisp editing of the voluminous material would have gone a long way making this a more appealing read.Also, it was very hard to empathize with the numerous characters since none of them lead remotely ""normal"" lives. I believe that the book does not, in spite of all those pages upon pages of writing, succeed in making the reader get past the initial distaste or prejudices towards characters who resort to questionable livelihoods or lifestyles prone to failure."
2,The Interminable Adventures of Figgy Newton,"Protagonist Lin is like a fig newton, crusty outside and ooey-gooey inside. He can take on bullies and corrupt guards in prison, but he's a nauseating softie for friends and one green-eyed, expatriot lady.I thought the tale of an Aussie busting out of prison and settling into Bombay as a slum doctor was very imaginative until I learned it's what the author did. Like many an autobiographer, Roberts tells about a pure hero whose only fault is a little naivete. Well, he's such an insufferable Galahad, it's unbelievable -- this sap is an unreliable narrator really.And he badly needs an editor. Lin undergoes what seems like thousands of adventures in this 900-page tome and never seems to learn much from any of them. Stuff just happens. Roberts is a decent writer, with some nice turns of phrase, but after 900+ pages, he still couldn't wind this thing up, just dropping hints about yet another adventure. Who cares?"
2,"Yeah, The Indian Mafia Is Full Of Wonderful People . . .","who only have the citizens' best interests at heart and Mr. Roberts was lucky enough to work for them and describe all the good works they do. If it weren't for the Indian Police bothering them for bribes and occasionally torturing them, the Indian Mafia along with Gregory would certainly make Bombay a paradise on earth.He and Mother Teresa did a lot for the poor of India. He did admit he was paid a lot a better than her and got to hang out with some of the top-paid Western hookers. Happily, he didn't have to pay them for their services.My feeling is he'll end up in jail again so we may be lucky enough to get another book out of him."
1,Disappointing,"Unfotrunately Shantaram did not grab my imagination at all. Nor did I find it emotionally satisfying. I realize Shataram is meant to be a kind of Bollywood story - over the top, flowery, cliched etc. but the Bollywood movies I've seen have been engaging and strangely satisfying, despite their soppyness etc. Shantaram was not engaging because the poor writing and shallow characters spoil the story."
1,A sad indicator,"What a let down! After reading all the positive reviews and hearing all the talk about what a great masterpiece this book is it took me precisely seventeen pages of tortured reading to set this book aside.While the place setting is mildly intriguing the terrible prose quickly diminished any interest that was briefly picqued. Rather than having been written by an escaped convict holed up in a seedy hotel room smoking dope, it struck me as having been written by a below average college freshman holed up in a dormroom smoking dope.Whoever wrote the blurb on the cover deserves more credit.All I can say is that it strikes me as a sad indicator of what proves to be popular reading and which elicits such widespread adulation, if that is to be believed. I will say though that this ""tome"" is sufficiently hefty to act as fine doorstop."
1,Not pleased.,"I received the audio cd set in a timely fashion. The set included 35 cds. The first five played, the sixth didn't, the next four worked, the fifth didn't and it went on like that until the end. The quality of the recordings are not consistant."
1,"buy used, please","Everyone should google this author before spending money on his work. I did and found out that he is a lifetime career criminal. This guy started out as a heroin addicted robber in his native country, broke out of prison. During a life on the run, he was recruited by the mafia, doing currency crime, passport forgery, drug smuggling and gunning operation in Nigeria, Zaire, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan..etc. He was imprisoned in several countries. Finally after being jailed in Germany with terrorists, he was send back to his country.His decades long activities deeply affect so many people in so many countries. Please think twice before buying his books."
1,Don't support this ex-con--he's made enuf $,"The author ""escaped from an Australian prison where he had begun serving a 19-year sentence"". 19 years!? He must have really been a bad dude.He's made enough money now, with a movie script coming, and that's enough. If you insist on buying this prolix tome, buy the book used so the author makes nothing off the royalty. Otherwise you're promoting crime."
4,Shantaram,"Overall, pretty compelling stuff. The main character was a heroin addict and armed robber who escaped prison in Australia to journey to Bombay. The book begins with the start of his time in Bombay, and covers his various adventures there as he opens a clinic in the slums and eventually gets involved with organized crime. Some of his similes and metaphors (""a silence so profound that the breeze against my ears was like a child's sleepy whisper"" for example) made me grit my teeth, but the story and characters were enthralling...I wrote more at my blog: [...]"
5,Shantaram,"This book is truly a masterpiece. It is long and for my liking should have been longer. I read the book for over 2 months whenever I found the time and must admit that it took me to a whole new place fully immersed in the lives of those undertaking this incredible journey. When I eventually finished the book, I was very saddened because the journey ended for me also. I would have loved to continue reading this story with all its plots and highlights for years and years.....But alas.... Thanks for making this book available Gregory and transposing me to the India that you obviously got to know and love so well!!!"
4,5 stars for the story; 3 for the grammar,"Well, I'm only about a third of the way through this book, but, so far, I am finding it equally fascinating, and annoying. Fascinating, because of the author's meticulous attention to detail, in his every description of life in Bombay, and its people; and annoying, because the author uses way, way, WAY too many commas, and it's an irritating distraction, that his editors are to blame for not having corrected. Don't you agree? I admit that this quasi-review is a bit flip, but for those grammarians out there, please be warned that the extreme overuse of punctuation nearly outweighs one's enjoyment of the story itself and the pleasure of learning about India. Enough said!"
2,should have been half as long,"I started out loving this book, some of the prose was amazing and I marked some passages for later use. After page 150, my ""I like this"" marks fell sharply away and then disappeared after page 385 ... but the story continued, and continued, and continued. Because the beginning was so good, I tried to finish but gave up around page 426 feeling angry. It is almost as if someone else stepped in to finish the book - perhaps the author had a contract to get to 1,000 pages rather than stop at 500???"
2,Overrated,Long long long and long. Way too long. The story could have been summed up just as well in 300-400 pages.
3,Too long,Great novel. Unbelievable writing. Just way too long. Really enjoyed it for a while and honestly ended up skipping to the end.
3,Great ideas but flat characters,"The author lost me on page 23. You are not reading Dostoevsky. No mistake on that. If you can have compassion on author's human fallacy and focus on his love for his friends, you will be able to finish this book, with a little bit of skipping here and there. The author sees the suffering of the poor and express his respect to their compassion toward humanity. He sees the suffering of the lepers and their strength to turn curse into healing. He sees the brave fights of the heartbroken and their struggle to turn their bleeding into honor. There was certainly a lot of ballywood elements in this book and even though it is supposed to be autobiographical fiction, it was bit hard to believe due to one or two dimensional characters."
4,"A commitment, but worth it!","I learned a lot from Shantaram. My only experience with India was a day in Bombay and two days in Delhi in 1969 and the movie Slumdog Millionaire. The author gives a very detailed view of life n the ""slums"" of Bombay and in the prison system at the time. Also the mob the war in Afganistan against the soviets, etc. etc. etc. You see why it takes over 900 pages to tell this epic tale. I found the author's style appealing and read large amounts of the book at single sittings. I do recommend it for it's scope and about a part of the world most of us know little about."
5,Amazing novel!,"This work of fiction is so well written, the reader can see the colors and smell the fragrances and odors of Bombay, India."
4,Super Summer Read,"Shantaram...an engaging thriller that I couldn't put down. It is written as to make you think that this is a true story. But the storyline itself is rather farfetched in some places. I checked out the bibliography and it is listed as ""fiction."" So I am going to assume this is an extremely embellished account of the author's life. Regardless, it is quite engaging and hard to put down. Sometimes the author seems to go over the same themes, but I just glossed over those pages, which wasn't much of a loss, considering the substantial size of this novel. I cannot wait for the movie to come out; I only hope they do not ruin this book in theater as they did ""The DaVinci Code."""
5,You MUST read this book!,"The narrator of the audiobook is a master of his art in the highest possible degree.The book itself astounding, the author is not just some ex-crim who decided the write a book, he is a writer first and foremost.If you want a thoroughly engrossing read then read this."
3,It's Just Okay,"Having spent fifteen months of my adult life in Peshawar, Pakistan, and having been to India, I was able to relate to some of the things that took place in this book by my own observations some 40 plus years ago. My time in Pakistan was an unpleasant experience so that is probably the reason I had a difficult time getting through the book. As I read Shantaram, I kept having flashbacks. For the reader who has never ""been there, done that"" it will probably be entertaining for them."
3,Long book,"The story itself is interesting for the most part, but drags on a bit and i find it hard to concentrate on the content all the time. It does however give a good insight into life in India. The book got such high reviews that I expected a more enjoyable read."
4,a must read,"Great depiction of india, marvelous story, amazing life the writer had. a def must read. but beware it is a bear of a book."
4,Powerful and gripping story in need of better editing.,"Wow! What a story Mr. Roberts tells, based on his life as an escaped convict from max. security prison in Australia, posing as a doctor/healer in the slums of Mumbai, dealing drugs and then other illicit trades, fighting alongside the mujaheddin in Afghanistan in the 1980's, and joining the Mumbai mafia. Each step of the way, he has words of wisdom and redemption. However, he and his editor have overindulged his tendency to ramble a bit. This book was over 900 pp, but I still stayed up day and night reading it until I finished it. Bravo, Mr. Roberts!"
3,A Great Escape (pun intended),"The interesting story is the author himself, of course (who wrote from his experience). Although some of the writing and philosophy (of the author via his characters) are annoying or even embarrassing, in all the story is very good, the reading goes quickly, and you are in fact transported to another culture -- with a view that you would probably never have. Roberts is talented without being a great writer. I'd still recommend."
4,"Life in Mumbai, India","I was a little hesitant when I first picked up this book because of its thickness, but I'm glad I did. Gregory David Roberts has this amazing way of describing things through words. He made me fall in love with Mumbai, India; which is where this book was set.This book is about his life in India. Most of it is based on actual events, however some of it was fabricated for entertainment purposes. The story is about his life in India, and his life in the organised crime business.The most intriguing part of this book for me was the love story that developed between him and a particular woman. Roberts has a lot of quirky remarks about life, love, and relationships that I loved."
4,shantaram,"Very well written and evocative, shows love and respect for the Indian people and great insight into the appalling inequality they endure and the spirit with which they survive."
4,A Gripping Page-turner.,A very well written novel. The author is fairly descriptive and paints a great picture of the characters various escapades.Combined with the personal history and experience that the author brings to the table - this book is a must read for those who would love to read intriguing and exciting pseudo-biographical thrillers.
2,rookie writer,"i read all the time. hardly ever do NOT finish a book. tried many times to go back and give it another shot, but this ""formula"" style writing doesn't do it for me. PASS."
2,"begins well, becomes self-indulgent","I adored the first half of the novel, which made me feel as though I was exploring India alongside the protagonist. The second half was something else entirely, graphically violent and utterly illogical."
1,Orientalist grandiloquence,"Apart from the one-liners, which were sometimes brilliant, this was an extremely poorly written novel. The descriptions were cheesy, cliched, and unbelievably mango-breasty: ""eyes the color of the desert before a rainstorm""... come on, that's terrible!The stories about the slums, the prison, and the passport laundering were interesting, if you could get through the orientalist prose and suffer through his pathetically overwrought passages about Karla, her green eyes, her quick half-smile, and whatnot.This book should have been a Bollywood movie. It had all the absurd constructs of Bollywood fantasies - the elusive love interest, guns and violence, a hard, lonely hero, the comic low-class Indian side-kick, and the evil gangsters and patriarchal wise men.And if it had been a movie, at least it would have been over sooner."
4,Shantaram,Extraordinary book writen as a novel but is clearly an autobiography. Very compelling story.Drags a little in the fourth quarter
3,Wish it was still shareware,I played the first elf bowling when it first came out on the net as share ware. I guess it became pretty popular since you now have to purchase it to play it.I would recommend this game only as something to do if you bored or to get a few laughs. You play as Santa trying to bowl down your elves which have gone on strike. It can be fun at times but is not at all challenging unless you try to hit the animals and stuff although I've never been able to get the frog.Note: Amazon has the best deal I've seen for this game.
5,Super Elf Bowling,Our son loves this game has played it several hours since he received it and would recommend it for anyone. Lots of fun.
4,Elf Bowling - good for the money,"This is a pretty fun, mindless game that you can play when you really don't want to think. Very cute elves that yell at you. Very cute."
1,boring and pointless,"What's wrong with a movie that has a clear, straightforward, coherent story? Maybe there's something wrong with me, but that's what i expect, and that's what this movie does not have. I see a scene in which two women are having soup together and chitchatting, while the camera sweeps around for no apparent reason, dodging behind furniture. What's the point?"
2,Ketchup Vs Sugar (hill Gang),"So,I heard the song ""Asereje"" early in the summer in Paris where it was all the rage. As soon as I heard the song, it sounded familiar. I searched my memory banks for a few seconds and lo and behold the chorus sounded very familiar to the intro rap of Sugarhill Gang's classic ""Rapper delight."" ...i said a hip hop the hippie the hippieto the hip hip hop, a you dont stopthe rock it to the bang bang boogie say up jumped the boogieto the rhythm of the boogie, the beat...Las ketchup no doubt have interpreted these lyrics to whatever jargon they use and I think they are just shy of plagiarism. But you must listen and compare for yourself. The spanglish version is futile as you can barely understand their English. Prediction: One hit wonder."
1,"""Arseje"" is CRAP","This song is the worst piece of crap I've heard on the radio... EVER!!!. It's nothing but a group of ugly talentless spanish chicks who don't know english trying to sing ""Rapper's Delight"" over surf music. I'm not surprised that most of the people who bought this coaster also bought TATU's last album. atleast that's a good sign that this crappy song won't be poluting the airwaves for very long and will die out soon just like that damn TATU song. Everyone who bought this album is SICK, SICK I SAY, SIIIICK!!!!!!, I hope you all die soon. And if I could rate this CD as 0 stars i would, but the damn rating system only goes as low as 1, so that will have to do."
1,What kind of name is Las Ketchup?!,"The ketchup song has got to be the dumbest song I've ever heard. It sounds like something from barney and friends. I thank god that this pathetic group hasn't been all over tv and radio too much. Even if i spoke fluent spanish, i would hate the ketchup song. I'd rather stick a foreign object up my ass than listen to this terrible music."
1,THIS CD IS JUST AWFUL!,"I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT ""ASEREJÉ"" IS BEING HAILED AS THE NEW MACARENA. AT LEAST MACARENA IS FUN TO DANCE TO AND LOS DEL RIO ARE GREAT SINGERS, UNLIKE THIS CD, WHICH I WHOLEHEARTEDLY DO NOT RECOMMEND. I SHOULD KNOW, I LIVE IN SPAIN AND HAVE HAD TO SWALLOW THIS HORRIBLE LITTLE SONG THE ENTIRE SUMMER. IT'S SUPPOSEDLY A SPANISH REMAKE OF SUGARHILL GANG'S RAPPER'S DELIGHT. HOWEVER, IT MAKES NO SENSE, AND THE MUSIC IS REALLY IN BAD TASTE. IF YOU WANT A SONG YOU CAN UNDERSTAND, BUY THE ORIGINAL RAPPER'S DELIGHT AND SKIP THE KETCHUP GIRLS."
2,Las Ketchup?,"Sometimes people criticizes other because they do not agree with a performer or because they do not understand what are they trying to say, such is a case of Las Ketchup, you can even understand a word of what are they singing. Well they are using a Spanish dialect called El Catalan if I am not mistaken. For a rest it isn't a good disc at all just for a first single asereje and others in the CD, I believe that it will it happens as in a Macarena that everyone got impressed and infected of its rhythm that no one cares about a lyrist. If you can get just single get otherwise you won't find much in a CD."
2,Something That Will Never Be Entirely Accepted In America..,".......and for good reason! Like Soccer, Why the European's go for this kind of stuff is beyond me. Even if you are a world music listener like myself...(I have a collection spanning all the way from traditonal Moroccan to current Japanese pop) Las Ketchup is still unbearable. No hook, no chorus! One of the goofest songs to come out since the Macarena! A piece of crap!"
3,POP music that does it,"Pop music is just that. It has an appeal. I heard this song playing in the Musee D'lerotic in Paris last week and a ten second clip woke me this morning and has me on the net looking for where I can buy it. I don't know if it's the next Macarena (which was pop and became extremely annoying due to overplaying) and I hope it doesn't, because I enjoy it. It is easy to listen to and requires no thought. It inspires emotions. I have been telling people about it for a week. That is unusual for listening to a song once, at least for me. If I were you I would spend whatever it took to get a copy to enjoy before the POP-Culture industry ruins it."
4,NOT POP BUT GOOD,"I do not know what this other guy is talking about but this cd is not europop. It is more like flamenco and it is entirely in spanish and there are dance songs on it. It is more like spanish pop then europop. If you are buying it expecting to get more songs like the main song which is the best do not. The good thing is that you could consider it like a single. It has the spanglish, spanish, karaoke, and hippi versions of the song. But overall you can open your mind to a new type of music.I met them on Columbus Day Parade here in New York and they wee very snotty and rude and stuck up."
4,Infectious!,"As much as the words are non-sense, the rhythm is definitely infectious! Can't help it, just gotta wiggle when the song is turned on.Asereje was big in Asia this past x'mas trip, it seemed to just put smile on people's faces everywhere I went, even when the economy is so bad and life is so difficult for many..."
3,Good advice,This book has some great advice but nothing earth shattering. This book is a bit simplistic with little indepth information. It does give a good insight into the differences between man and women and sexuality.
4,"A vivid, truly scary read","This book, also seen on shelves under the title of ""Dan Leno and the Lime House Golem"" paints a splendid picture of a squalid scene. The sights, sounds, and smells of London are vividly imagined by the interested reader. This very creepy story left me dazed and shaky. When I finished this book late at night, I put the book down, thought about it for a moment, then picked it up and started over again at page 1."
4,In search of 'The Limehouse Golem',"A clever and engaging novel, with an interesting blend of probability and possibility.Who murdered whom, and why? There is more than one murder, and potentially a number of murderers in this novel and Mr Ackroyd provides some intriguing possibilities.The year is 1880, and in a novel inhabited with real people as well as with entirely plausible characters, we set off to dissect the life and times of Elizabeth Cree who is on trial for the murder of her husband.We meet Karl Marx and George Gissing. We spend time in London's variety theatre and we become all too familiar with life in Victorian London.Some readers will enjoy the elements of mystery, others will enjoy the superb writing. I enjoyed it all.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
2,Rat Pack Christmas CD,I was not at all impressed with this CD. Boring. My husband didn't like it either.
4,Christmas with the Rat Pack,Great CD for decorating the house. It was good to hear some of my favorites singing the holiday songs. It's very nostalgic!
4,Lots of fun!,"This is a wonderful Christmas album for those (like me) who enjoy the crooners but don't necessarily want to buy all their separate holiday compilations. Thoroughly enjoyable, a great selection of songs performed with the classy and classic sound you expect from Frank, Dino, and Sammy. Fabulous music for wrapping presents, trimming the tree, background for a holiday gathering, or just puttering around the house!"
3,Had high expectations...,"...and was rather disappointed. It was good, just not great. Maybe I expected more happy fast-paced Xmas songs and this was too maudlin for me."
3,Do Not buy this(2010) version,"unless you can't get an older version. You CAN get an older version.This CD contains only 16 of the 21 selections from the previous ""Christmas With the Rat Pack"" albums.The 2002 compilation, which has all of these, plus 3 more from Dean(including The Christmas Blues which you may remember from the movie LA Confidential), 1 more from Frank(I Believe), and 2 duets from Dean Martin TV shows featuring Frank.The 2007 version, which is the SAME as the 2002. Simply reissued, not remastered.If you can't find either of these for a reasonable(whatever that is for you) amount, just download it from Amazon, which strangely includes the extra songs.The music here is very good, and a couple of the songs are hard to find elsewhere. The cover artwork is better than the earlier versions. Use it when you put this on your ipod, just don't leave 5 songs ""on the table""."
4,credit card hacked at Amazon,"A short time after downloading this great Christmas collection I was enjoying the selections; I then recieved a call from my credit card company. The agent asked if I had just made a purchase at a glass shop in Missouri. I told them ""no, I am now where near Missouri."" I seldom use my credit card and realized my card had just been hacked by somebody at Amazon during my purchase. My card was then closed by the agent. Be carefull using Amazon!"
4,Rat-tastic!,"This collection of holiday songs is fantastic addition to anyone's holiday music mix.It should be noted though that the featured ""Rat Pack"" is in actuality only Frank Sanatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr. Only these three artists are featured singing, with the exception of at least one song from a live performance where a few other fellow rat-packers are in attendance.That technicality aside, it is an incredible assemblage of seasonal songs sung by the creme de la creme of big band swing. And for the current asking price, it's a no brainer."
4,Solid!,Overall I found the CD to be great - I was expecting a few more Christmas tunes but am very pleased with the selection the chose for this CD anyway. The recording quality is great and overall this inspires me to get more of the Rat Pack CD and DVD collections. What a blast it must have been to watch these guys live!
5,Thompson Twins Rock!,"This is one of the best greatest hits compilations I have bought in years. All fans will love this one. It takes me back to high school, when times were great and easy. This is for sure a feel good cd. Take about an hour and enjoy this one again and again."
1,headache inducing....,"as I'm on a crafty kick, I ordered this book on a discount book site cause it looked fun, quirky and frankly, was cheap as chips...Sadly, thank goodness I got this book cheap. It's horrible.My biggest complaint-the text and photos are done in a scrapbook or journal way that was supposed to be cool but actually made the book literally impossible for me to look at without getting a headache!Text was so crammed, swirled and overlayed on photos that it was impossible to read. Very annoying to pay good money for something you can't read! Artsy is one thing-illegibility is another:(I may have even tried to trudge through it if not for the total misrepresentation of this book. It's touted as a craft book-but less than a fourth is crafts and those are like ""be crafty and wear a scarf today""Final word on this book-totally skipworthy-not worth the $3.50 shipping charge if you get it for a penny! Wish I could give it no stars."
2,Not So Great,"I purchased this book after reading tons of great reviews. The book has some good ideas, but it was not what I expected at all. I think there are tons of other books out there that are worth spending your money on."
5,"A helpful, fun, fantasic book for every age",I purchased this book for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!!! The suprising thing is that I love it too. It is fun and whimsical. We have a great time reading it together and trying out the crafts and other tips. Keva and Clea are funky and hip with great ideas for all!!!!
3,It's the Cheetah Girls...,"... what else do I need to say? If you like the Cheetah Girls like my niece does, you'll love this movie. If not, why are you reading this review?"
4,entertaining for younger kids,"My 8 year old likes this mivie, she enjoyed the bonus scenes and song. My 14 year old said it was the stupidest thing she ever saw. But then she says that about most things...Very colorful and fun, typical Disney style bad acting and lame storyline. Fine for pre teens."
2,Cheetah girls need to stick to music,We love the Cheetahs but this movie isn't very good. You don't want to see fighting and controversy in a movie for this age group.
3,CHEETAH POWER,I CHOSE THIS RATING BECAUSE IT IS DIFFERENT WITHOUT RAVEN SIMONE AND SOME OF THE MOVIE IS A LITTLE ANNOYING WITH THE UNCLE GUY POKING AT HIS NEPHEW AND THINKING HE HAS THE SAY IN EVERYTHING. I LIKE HOW THE CHEETAH GIRLS WORK THRU OBSTACLES AND THE MUSIC IS COOL AND LIKE THEIR CLOTHES. I RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO IS INTO MUSICALS AND LIKES DANCING AND COOL CLOTHES
3,Reads like a sales pitch for Tony Robbins,"I expected this book to be more about The Psychology of Physical Immunity (like the title says) but found it to be more like a sales pitch for Tony Robbins. Honestly I couldn't get through all of it. But what I did read was pretty boring.The author spends a lot of time talking about his first time meeting Tony Robbins and how impressed he was with the self help icon. ""A Bear of a man..."" Really? Out side of a romance novel who describes people that way?"
3,GOOD BUT DOESN'T LAST,"I bought this sweeper after reading the reviews and it worked great for about six months, then the charger stopped working. I suppose I could try a new charger or talk to the manufactorer about how to replace the battery(if you can); but who wants to bother? By the time I order the replacement parts and pay for shipping I could almost by a new sweeper. I was really dissapointed with this one."
1,open your items as soon as they arrive.,"I bought this item last year. When the item arrived I put it in the closet. I had a brother pass away and my husband had a stroke. I also have 5 children. When Idid get around to open the box ,there wasn,t a instruction manual and extension pole was missing. This is fine for my kids.I am 5'8"" and then the charger fizzled out.I tried to contact Karcher ,they never returned my calls. Amazon said it was past 90 days.So now i'm stuck with a broom for a munchkin and a dead charger. Always check your purchase as soon as it arrives."
3,"OK, not miraculous","Seems to do a good job of picking up the cereal and cracker crumbs that the kids drop on the hardwood floor in the dining room. We didn't want to get the heavy vacuum out daily. It's good that the kids can use this themselves when they are so inclined, and not dent the furniture, since the base is all plastic. Truth is, we rarely use this. Even so, the metal pole started splitting where the two halves connect after about 5 uses. It may need some duct tape soon to hold it together. It holds a charge for a long time, I haven't had to plug it in much."
2,No easier than a regular vacuum,"I had hoped that this would bridge the gap between my dust buster (not much suction; have to bend over to vacuum) and my regular vacuum cleaner (big and heavy, stuffed in a closet). Unfortunately, the Karcher doesn't have much more suction than my dust buster, and it's much more unwieldy and heavy than I was hoping for. It also doesn't fit into corners or small spaces. I might as well drag out the regular vacuum as use this. I returned it."
1,Karcher K50 Cordless Electric Broom,"This broom only picks up large material. It will not pick up small particles nor dust. I found that the broom performed poorly, plus the rechargeable battery failed after only one month of use."
1,"Worked OK, then stopped working after 5 uses, Terrible customer service","Works OK on open floor, doesn't get along base boards or corners. Stopped working after only 5 uses. Their claim is ""no hassle exchange"". It's a hassel and the customer service rep was RUDE."
5,Very handy,As long as you don't expect this to totally replace your vacuum cleaner I think you will be pleased with this product. It is so handy for those little jobs you really don't want to drag out the vacuum to take care of. I use it daily for the quick pick-ups that seem to pop up. I even find pet hair when I empty it although I have no illusions it pulls up as much as a vacuum. I am totally pleased with it.
2,Lost and Not Found,"First off, the Karcher 50 works very well for quick cleanups. Mine lost one of its back wheels and I can not find a replacement anywhere. Karcher online is useless. The ""repair"" is apparently to buy a new one. No thanks, I'm still using mine and just letting it drag its butt on the floor!"
1,WHat The ...,What Is Up With Song Number 3 That Is A Ghetto Boys Song And they Stole Every Single Word Of It Even Stole The Beat How Can They Do That And Get Away With It they are now like P Diddy And They Say They Are Rappers WHat The ... Is Up With That i Used To Like Them Now I Hate Them I Will Not Buy Another One Of There CDS Again I Will Just Download them off the internet for now on
2,They could do better than this..,"Kane And abel frpm the bronx turned south? they seemed bored now maybe they should reinvent themselves,,, although nasty girl was pretty good production was very upto par and amazingly they did'nt sound like they were just rhyming to finish another worthless album, i think these guys have talent i could just tell {like mike tyson once a heavy hitter but now just a heavy misser} twinz get hungry again or hang it up surround your selfs with fresh talent that will inspire you both and push the envelope isn't that what gangsters are about taking risks start using your talent again...your small legacy is diminishing..save it or bounce before you embarass your self.."
2,Meh.,"I've pretty well lost interest in the nitro RC car thing. It was supposed to be an inexpensive hobby to occupy me when I couldn't afford to work on my real cars. I spent more time fixing this thing than I would have spent building an engine for my Mustang and only spent about half as much money. The Ofna buggy is very sturdy... I threw it against a tree and it was unscathed. The recoil, however- very weak and easily broken... hence why I had to buy a replacement on Amazon. The buggy was fun as hell for the 15 minutes I got to drive it out of the 3 weeks I worked on it..."
4,A really Different approach to the Son of God,"This book is a real eye-opener! It's especially good for those of us, who haver read the New Testament a few times and tend to think that ""we know it all already"" and cannot seem to find new insights in the Bible any more. The idea of imagining what it would be like, if Jesus was born today, in this world of hamburgers and TVs was really meaningful to me!"
5,Powerful Tool,"I disagree with the annonymous reader from Indiana. I believe that Jesus taught through parables that applied to those of His time, so that even the simplest person could understand them. His miracles were done with what was available to him. How is it sacriligous to assume that Jesus would have done things differently had his audience been different? The language, the details, none of that matters. The MESSAGE rings true throughout this book and is a good gut check to see if you are truly understanding your walk with the Lord. But it can also be a powerful tool to a non-Christian. Many people my age (19) have trouble digesting the Bible, and Bill Myers puts it simply enough (in present terms) that the message is impossible to miss. I will be passing this book on to a friend, and encourage him to pass it on to another."
3,Different in purpose from my expectations,"I bought this book with the expectation and hope that it would be a story that imagined what Christ and his life and ministry would have been like had he lived now, but instead it's a story that is basically Christ and his life merely superimposed onto a modern setting. This may be very useful for people who have trouble imagining Christ as a flesh and blood person, but I think for many Christians who are perhaps looking for a deeper understanding of how revolutionary his ministry really was, this might seem a little bit of a cardboard cut out of a story. I don't want to be too harsh. I think I just expected a different approach."
5,Eli a novel,"I am, quite litterally, in the middle of this compelling book. I did not know what to expect when I first opened the book. I have read the recent Left Behind book and Tonopha, and I was looking in to more christian authors. This one was worth my time. From where I stand now, I love it, and I'm not even done yet! I can't wait to finsh it.I recomend this book to those who are sincere about their religion and to those who aren't. Eather way, It's a great book!"
5,Eli,"This is a thought-provoking version of the story of Jesus in a modern day setting. Bill Myers has a way of writing that kept me reading in anticipation of how he would handle each stage of the life of Jesus and how the main character interacts with him. The story interchanges between the main character's ""real world"" and the world he encounters in his alternative state due to his health condition. Quite an interesting read..."
3,Typical Bestseller Material,"Eli is typical of most bestseller kinds of material. The narrative is extremely good and keeps driving you throughout the pages. And then you get to the end and think, ""Wait... Is that it?""When I finished reading this, I stopped and felt my way back through it and realized that it just felt hollow. It seemed like a shell of something real, and a fragile one at that. Were I to touch it, press on it just a bit, it would crack open, and I would see the void and emptiness beneath.There are some points where I did, admittedly, tear up, but they were few and based on a moment and not on the whole. It's an interesting concept, and, were it done exceedingly well, it would be startlingly powerful, but Myers just doesn't do that here. I don't see Jesus were he born 2000 years later. I see Eli, a miraculous and kind man. And it's just not enough."
1,Disgrace to Christianity,"Normally a fan of Myers, I would venture to say he should not have written this book. I don't think there is enough significance in asking the question, ""What if Jesus hadn't come until today?"" to devote an entire book to the subject. If you chose not to follow Jesus now, with the Bible, why would you read a fictional book and then chose to follow this portrayl of Jesus? I believe Jesus does not need to be updated, and I think Bill Myers was attempting to update Jesus. Jesus transcends time and culture. Personally I found much of the book to be sacriligious. I don't think Jesus would have planned to appear on Oprah, or feed the five thousand with hamburgers and fries. In my opinion, the doctors should have pulled the life support on Conrad right away."
5,Teaching Tool,"Eli is a great tool to both those who have read the bible&#65533;yet not understood the New Testament, and a great bridge for unbelievers.Bill Meyers has succuessfully removed the barriers of time and cultural to give us a fresh interpretation to the life and words of Jesus.Thank you!"
3,Jesus in our time?,"The premise behind this book was excellent, but I found the writing a little weak. The book is still worth reading, but there are many inconsistencies. For example, although I can't recall the churches ever being described as Christian, how could there be churches that follow the Christian faith and beliefs if Jesus wasn't born until the 1960's. Wouldn't the primary churches be Judaism and other old religions. The concept is good, but the background material needs more thought."
3,Continuity problems hamper story,"I really like Bill Myers' work. However, two things bothered me throughout. 1st, the dates in the ""alternate"" reality. Our date (AD 2000) is based on the birth of Christ. This should not be the case in the ""alternate"" reality if Christ (Eli) was not born until (our date) 1970. 2nd, the use of place-names like Santa Monica. ""Santa"" is saint. Maybe I'm off base here, but how can there be ""saints"" if there is no Christendom. Other instances of these kinds of continuity errors occur throughout.Besides this, I enjoyed the placing of Christ in modern day. The healing of the racist leader's daughter (Centurion's servant) hit home. If you want Bill Myers at his best, try ""Blood of Heaven""."
4,What a great discovery for me!,"I picked this book up at the airport while on a business trip and didn't expect to want to keep it. Not only that, but I am looking forward to the next book in July, Dangerous to Love, I believe. I liked the characters of Jake and Nate, both members of Omega, a supersecret government organization. But I am very much intrigued by the background relationship between Maggie (one of the operatives in Omega) and Adam, the aloof, controlled director of the group. That story will come up in the next book ,although I searched the sites and found that it was publised as Perfect Double, I think. I will try to scour the used book stores for it, but if not, will wait for July! Good reading!"
2,too far-fetched,"Charlotte figured this one out by doing a very quick investigation into rich and influential people. Sorry, dirty financial secrets aren't found out in two weeks by an intrepid trio of Victorian ladies.The ending was unsatisfactory as well. Basically fine to read on the bus or the plane, but not worth the money otherwise."
1,Boring,This is a review of the audio book. All I can say is that listening was painful. The audio book was talky and preachy. It seemed more interested in political theory than telling a good story. The mystery to the extent there was one was not exciting. I have enjoyed other Pitt and Charlotte stories but this one was not up to the standards. It is to be missed.
2,Is not my type of book,"This book tries to show you the human rights of the poor people in London while they resolve the mystery of a crime, you will never know who is the killer until the last page, not because the book is good, because it could be anyone of the book, the writer never tells you anything about the real killer.At the end of the book, nobody does nothing about the human rights or anything else."
4,A love story with history,"This obscure gem of a film is clearly a labor of love by Matthew Broderick, who directed it and stars as Nobel Laureate Richard Feynman in the story of his first marriage.Broderick ensures that we get a picture of Feynman's quirky personality, the very embodiment of the Scientific Method and iconoclastic clowning. But, the focus is clearly on his growing love for Aline, their marriage, and their life together.The film has a little more science than most Americans are comfortable with, but it's not overwhelming, and it serves to illuminate the relationship between Richard and Aline."
4,The film I had hoped for,"When I read ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman,"" I felt this great story of love and scientific adventure deserved a movie, so I was very pleased to discover Matthew Broderick had marshalled assets to make the film. As anyone who has read Feynman will understand, now I am waiting for a sequel--and that Broderick does it again.It's whimsical and tragic, funny and yet deadly serious about the way the world works."
4,Good Story,"As noted elsewhere, this is a love story about Dick and Arlene Feynman. It doesn't have much in it about the famous antics of one of the most human and personable physicists ever. More's the pity. It's a good film, but it leaves room for several future movies that incorporate all the stories that he left us."
4,A gem about the relativity of the personal and the historic,"Although set in the momentous days of World War II and among the historic setting of Manhattan Project Los Alamos, this small little gem steadfastly focuses us on private lives and private moments.Broderick and Arquette give wonderful performances."
4,Probably not for your average watchers but I loved it,"I like the romance part and really like the math parts. I have read a couple of Richard Feyman's autobiography so I knew he was funny, quirky and brillant and was glad a great deal of this made it into the movie. If you like this movie, go ahead and read SURELY YOU'RE JOKING, MR. FEYMAN and his other books."
2,About as exciting and emotional as a fish - very poorly done,"I hope someone rewrites this and makes another movie - it's a good story, done poorly.Broderick doesn't know how to do exciting or passion - he does everything so understated, so milk-toast. Like the nice but really boring guy next door. Likewise, I think Arquette underplayed her role in this to better match his.The real scientist this story is about was a much more interesting and passionate man, as I'm certain was his wife. Broderick in this role seems to have as much emotion as a fish.This movie was written, directed and acted poorly."
1,nothing but a amateur video production,"I am a martial arts fanatic, ... Oh,what a boring tape!---from the very beginning, it is awful. It is just like watching your neighbor's home video. This is no professional work. It is a waste of money!!! I can't believe they are selling this tape as a professional work."
5,Some of the best moments...,"Some of the best moments occured during seasons 1-3, not that the following seasons aren't good. But this Sunnydale High ""Yearbook"" has alot of information and stuff to cherish forever. The 32 pages of color photos is also a great addition to this book! This is a fun, great read, and it's for any Buffy fan to remember back when the scoobies were at Sunnydale High."
4,good interesting and full of yummy pictures to no and tell!,very interesting full of very cool stuff buy it now but dont if u already no everything there is to no about the show!.
3,"Cute, Clever, but Not Worth the Money","I was thrilled to find this at a thrift shop for 75 cents. For that price, I'm completely satisfied, of course! It's well-produced, has some funny text (Cordelia's poem is great), and is an amusing coffee-table item. However, I was disappointed with the number of pages that were obviously there just to fulfill the ""typical yearbook"" role (sports teams, clubs, etc.) that had nothing to do with any of the central characters of the series, and weren't even funny. Those wastes of pages could have been filled with just about anything related to the show and I'd have been happy. The senior ""quotes"" were pretty worthless... what a wasted opportunity for some hilarity! But the signatures from the characters, Buffy's mom's note on behalf of MOO, etc. are certainly in the spirit of the show and will amuse fans. In short, I wouldn't pay full price for this, but I'm still glad I read it."
4,BEST BOOK I OWN,"This is a hard cover year book, that has classmates signitures in it. The book is supposed to be Buffy's year book, so all of the messages refure to her. This was an original idea that deserves a good look."
4,Missing kids from SUnnydale High? Never!,"Good pictures, but I could have wished for more. However, my 15 year old daughter and I were very pleasantly surprised to find ""written greetings"" by characters we know from the series in hand writing styles that are VERY in character. How did they do that!If you read this book closely, you will find funny little hints at the reality of living in a town where classmates go missing and teachers are eaten "" Uh, the homework ate my teacher""..Worth the money!"
5,Sunnydale High Yearbook,"This book you would think it was a real yearbook with sigatures,comments,dances and best couple ect.This book also tells you about the school itself.You find out a little more about the people in Sunnydale High.You also find out about some missing episods!"
3,Sunnydale memories?,"I love Buffy, and I love collecting the books. I was excited to get this but I was pretty dissapointed.There are some cool pictures and the captions are cute, but there's page of things about the teenis team and stuff like that that wasn't in the series, and is really boring. If you're a Buffy fanatic this is a good buy, but I was expecting more for my $18."
4,great book!,"I loved this book from when I got it. The color pages are cool, and i loved all the little inside jokes and comments (just like a real high school yearbook). I also loved how they took stuff from the show as well as the book series. The one thing that i thought was a little weird was that they had stuff about Angel and Faith when they didn't go to Sunnydale High."
4,A cute but trivial addition to your Buffy library,"I got this as a birthday present and it is amusing, but a relatively minor Buffy book. You keep thinking they could have done a lot more, but if you were actually on your high school yearbook staff, you know how much of a pain these things are to put out. You read throught this once at which point you will have gotten everything you are going to get. A lot of the pictures appear elsewhere. But kids like to sign their names to it, so maybe some of us are just older than the target audience on this one. (You think?)"
2,Bath Boo Boo,"I liked this movie until the part where the mom was taking a bath and the butler accidently came in and saw her. I don't like to think about things like that! I love the Disney channel, but I turned off the movie after that scene because it made me feel discusted. I hope that I will never ever ever see that movie again! All movies have their own trick and as it goes on, it gets worse. I think that showing that is wrong because it tries to make kids think that it's okay, but it's not. Most parents would let their kids watch it but not our family. I think that all of my friends families would not want them to watch that either. The kids were great, but the movie was awful in that part.Summer, 9 years oldPS If you tried to make that scene look funny well...IT WAS NOT."
2,Where in the hell are the agents???,"This just goes to show you that Tom Green and Brooke Shields are has beens...starring in movies that are this lame, boring, and down right stupid like this one, is a very good example. I was not a fan of Tom Green to begin with, but I basically had to watch this movie to see if my customers would be willing to rent it. I was dissapointed in this movie, did not laugh once! Terrible, awful, skip this movie at all costs please!!!And finally, Tom and Brooke...if you really want to make it back to the mainstream in entertainment...get some new agents!!"
3,worth a giggle,I'm a Tom Green fan so it was worth the buy. Silly without all the standard raunchy Tom Green antics.
5,Hilarious movie with good storyline,"Tom Green is probably the funniest person of the later 2000 decade in my opinion. This movie isn't as obnoxious as his stunts, it is him playing a funny movie. It does have a few slapstick moments like The Tom Green Show, but it isn't that bad. It is a very funny movie and I recommend it."
3,Needs better packaging,"When I received my DVD, it was not secure in the jewel case, but just knocking around in it. It skips in a few places but my granddaughter watches it anyway. I would like to see the jewel case opened before shipping, an insert put in the case to prevent the DVD from coming loose and the jewel case shrink wrapped again."
5,Bob the Butler,I ordered this movie for Thanksgivings because I was having dinner at my home. I had water damage the day before Thanksgiving and the plumber could not come out until the Saturday after the holiday. I was so depressed so I watched the movie while a friend was trying to fix the problem. I laughed until I cried. I packed all the uncooked food and travelled to my sister home and prepared Thanksgiving dinner. I took the movie and they asked could the keep the movie until Saturday. My family enjoyed watching this movie on Thanksgiving Day. When you are sad and need a good laugh. Definitely put on this movie. Excellent family movie.
5,BOB THE BUTLER IS HILARIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I SAW THIS MOVIE ON DISNEY CHANNEL AND IT'S AWESOME.I USUALLY DON'T LIKE TOM GREEN ,BUT YOU SHOULD DEFINETLY BUY IT . IT'S ABOUT A GUY NAMED BOB WHO LOSES HIS JOB AND GOES TO A VERY UNORGANIZED BUTLER SCHOOL.WHEN HE GETS HIRED BY A FAMILY, EVERTHING GOES WRONG,very WRONG"
5,Very entertaining movie,"I frequently watch the movies that are broadcast on the Disney Channel with my two younger daughters and my grandson. Every time they show ""Bob the Butler"" I try to make sure I'm done with my housework so that I can enjoy it with them. It is a very entertaining movie and my young ones enjoy it very much. That is why I decided to buy it so we could watch it whenever we wanted to. This DVD will definitely get a lot of viewing at our house!"
3,B the B,"I did not buy it for myself but the person I did like a whole lot, and wants to buy one more"
2,TV tuner works poorly,"The TV tuner on this thing doesn't work correctly. I called Samsung to ask for help in scanning and saving TV channels to memory. It will not save any channels from my cable signal. They say I should use a cable box tuner, or VCR tuner, and bypass the TV tuner. They have no fix available. It sounds like a defect to me.Also, changing channels on the TV tuner takes 2.5 seconds to go from channel 2 to channel 3. That makes surfing the channels impossible, and makes the need for storing your favorites necessary (but storing to memory doesn't work, so I am out of luck).Picture quality is quite good."
2,Caution: Migranes Ahead,"This is my second Samsung. I bought it based on positive experience with my first 26"" Samsung. Anyway, shortly after setup, a high-pitched squeeling noise developed. It wasn't noticable all the time, but it kept returning under various conditions. It seemed to come from the lower left hand side from rear of the unit. Besides squealing, the stand leaned to the left and no adjustments available. Overall, nice picture, beautiful design, easy to use, but the screeching will give you a migrane. Returned it and bought a 32"" Sony Bravia XBR (KDL32XBR4) for a few $$ more. Be sure to look for the XBR4 model because it has Motionflow 120Hz speed and 10-bit processing. HD is absolutely amazing on the XBR4. The KDL32XBR4 is by far the best 32"" set on the market. Check it out and compare the Sony side-by-side before you purchase this 32"" Samsung."
3,"Great for HD, not so much for non-HD","I've had this TV for a few months and I have a mixed opinion. For set-up I've just got the cable plugged directly into the TV, so I just get the network HD channels (our cable company's HD line-up isn't worth the extra $ to get it yet). The non-HD channels are disappointing and I think my old TV set actually had a better picture. This is my first HDTV, so I can't say if all non-HD channels look as poor via an HDTV or if it's this particular model. The HD channels though are excellent. One downside I've noticed though is if a channel is in 1080i the picture will break up a bit with fast moving action - this doesn't happen with the 720p channels. With a lot of HD channels I'd rate this 4 stars, but with mixed viewing HD and non-HD it's 3 stars."
4,Great TV,"-AWESOME- picture. There is a lag when I change channels, but I don't flip channels much (I use the guide and that works just fine) so I don't really notice it. I have a Wii and I noticed a lot of lag when not on Game mode, but this tv remembers what mode each input takes so when I switch to the Wii now it goes right into game mode and, while I think there's still a little lag, i don't really notice it once I'm into the game. Anyway, 4 stars because of the lag thing, but the picture is terrific, and the sound is just fine for in TV speakers."
4,Best LCD For The Money,I recently bought this Tv from Amazon and it arrived 5 days early and in perfect condition..I am blown away by the picture and the sound...Sleek look and easy to setup...Hooked my PC tower up to it and watched my music videos through my suuround sound and it was awesome...Then I called Dishnetwork and went High Definition...Ohh my god what a picture.Couldn't leave the couch the rest of the Day...In my opinion I am glad I bought the Samsung with no complaints so far...Only bad experience I had is when I went to RadioShack to buy an HDMI cable...Get this they wanted $91.00 for it...Paid $39.00 for the cheapest they had and walked away still upset about paying that much for a cable...I will buy form Amazon again.
2,Still waiting for delivery,Still waiting for delivery. Did not deliver as told at the time of ordering. If you want to get your TV in any reasonable amount of time go to Wal-Mart or Best Buy. I knew better than order a big-ticket item on Amazon. Just stick with ordering books here. TV is still sitting in Atlanta and has been there for several days.
3,Good when it works.....,"I purchased this in December 2007, and it came with a standard one year warranty. After 17 months, the picture died. The set would still turn on and I could hear the audio, but no picture whatsoever. I got it fixed at a cost of $294 (new motherboard needed). Fortunately, VISA paid for the repair, under their free one-year extended warranty provision (check with your credit card issuer to see if it's a feature of your particular issuer).This TV will display a great picture with HD content, but for whatever reason, the video from my 480i/p DVD player (a Sony) looked terrible. The sound is merely ok. The design and finish is outstanding; this TV looks great just sitting there. I'm hoping I can get many more years out of it without any more repair issues, but it's discouraging to see that so many owners have had issues with this set."
2,"Unless you're legally deaf, don't buy this tv.","I bought this TV a while ago (as in over a year) and I am very embarrassed to admit it's taken me this long to look up the problem. While it's a wonderful tv if you can't hear the whistling coming from the it (which is why I gave this tv two stars instead of one), the whistling is enough to make me say it was DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE PURCHASE.It's fantastic to watch for the first 20 minutes to a half hour, but then the high-pitched whistling becomes unbearable until you shut the tv off. You can hear it from other rooms too, in my house anyway, so walking away won't help either.I'm grateful to others who have posted their problem on here because I will be calling Samsung as soon as I post this review to *hopefully* get it repaired free of charge because of the defect."
4,A nearly perfect product,"Samsung LNT3253H 32"" LCD HDTV is perfect for a master bedroom. The audio is just right for such environment. Picture quality is superior. Features and remote control are well designed."
1,Buyer BEWARE,"This television was wonderful (great picture, great black color, nice features) for 2.5 years and then it just QUIT (died) without any warning. I called Samsung toll free to try to diagnose and they said there was nothing that could be done. So, at the time of purchase this t.v. cost me $1,000 and it lasted for 2.5 years. DEFINITELY NOT WORTH IT. Beware of this model - walk away from it and buy something else. I will probably never buy Samsung again because there is no way I could trust the brand after this. (Coincidentally I also recently bought a Samsung external DVD drive for my laptop and that too did not work - fortunately I was able to return that and get my money back)."
1,Defective and Nonexistent Customer Service,I bought this TV a few months ago. Menu randomly popped up on screen repeatedly so you couldn't watch anything. Samsung required it be shipped to them (my expense) despite warranty stating in-home repair service. Samsung denied receipt initially even though I had a UPS delivery confirmation. Refused to replace with refurbished unit despite exercising this option. Now stating up to 21 more business days from now before I might get TV returned. Horrible anti-consumer experience dealing with them.
5,Excellent first HD tv,"I meandered and debated for a long, long time before biting the bullet and getting a new HD TV. The 32"" Samsung LNT3253H has been an excellent choice.The tv is connected to a Dish Network HD box and anOPPO DV-970HD Up-Converting Universal DVD Player. The picture quality from both is excellent.The tv is next to a sliding glass window, and the brightness of the tv is great, the is not problems with glare or anything from the light next to the tv.Tons of connections to and from the stereo, I'm using hdmi connections for the dish and dvd.Very satisfied, shipping and delivery was fast & excellent. The price on amazon when I got it was $300 less than any local, big box store. Great deal & tv, I would do it again in a heartbeat."
2,beautiful picture but sound issues,"This is a nice TV with a beautiful picture and lots of inputs, but ... and it's a big but, it has sound issues galore.You'll will see in the discussion thread this had issues from a high pitched sound and other issues of HDMI sound drop outs.I returned one and got a replacement because I like the TV so much, but that also has the sound issue so I'm giving up and returning it.If asked around and several people have had similar issues with different models, so I think it's a Samsung thing in general.It's a shame, I really wanted the TV, but it doesn't matter how nice the picture is if sound and noises are ruining the whole experience."
2,My Tea Pot Is Nice To Watch,"I bought the Samsung LNT3253H 32 inch lcd tv and found that after only a few months, the TV whistles so loudly it sounds like a tea pot. The picture is great, but the annoying noise coming from the back of the TV is awful. I'm sending it back. Hold off on buying this model until a fix is made."
1,WARNING: About Replacing The Power Circuit Board,"When they replaced the power circuit board, make sure the backlight is working properly because some new board will disable the backlight and it's no longer adjustable (same on Energy Saving mode) and your HDTV will lose 25-50% contrast ratio.Power Supply - part no. BN44-00192A"
4,Samsung lnt3253h,Great product everything I EXPECTED AND THEN SOME.THE ONLY PROBLEM IF YOU ARE OVER 40 OR HAVE EYE PROBLEMS BE SURE TO HAVE A MAGNAFYING GLASS TO READ ANY OF THE INSTRUCTION MANUALS.
4,"Good But,,.,,","Great TV but it has one flaw, the controls on the TV itself, are hard to use. They are not normal buttons but more of a sensor. Sometimes they dont recognize you are pushing them. Just dont break or lose your remote and you should be fine"
3,Sound Problem,"My Samsung 26LV67 32"" was delivered yesterday and I am experiencing the same high-pitch noise that continues even when muted reported on January 7. I have tried making sound adjustments but have had no luck. I did discover that the noise starts on my TV when it been warmed up after running for about an hour. I just signed on the Amazon site to figure out how to contact customer service to return it when I saw the post about the noise (I ordered my TV on January 6). Except for the noise (so for the 1st hour of viewing), I love the TV. However when the noise starts is it SO annoying! I think that a dog would run out of the room. I am very disappointed."
5,Great TV Great Price,"1st I would like to say that I am a huge fan of Samsung when it comes to HDTVs. I own a DLP and a Plasma.This one was actually bought by/for my Mom based on my recommendations and looking at the various TVs at Best Buy. I spoke to her after Christmas once she got it set up.She is in love with TV. This is her 1st HDTV and she is still in the process of getting the HD box from the cable company so she has not seen the complete wow factor. She is still amazed by the clarity of the picture, the brilliance of the colors, and the ease of setting it up.I would highly recommend this TV for anyone wanting to make the jump to HD, but doesn't want to jump into the larger, higher price point TVs."
2,Still has sound issues with new manufacture date(Update 2Mar08),"Got this tv three weeks ago. Looks nice and great picture. I get an HDMI cable and hook it up for my HD cable and two days later the sounds starts dropping out every 30 seconds. I have the 1020 firmware and my manufacture date of my tv is 31 OCT 2007. Still waiting on Samsung to provide an answer on the fix. I would stay away from this TV until this sound drop out problem is resolved.** (My set was serviced and diagnosed with a bad mainboard). The set was replaced with a new one in mid December, I have had no issues with the replacement since and would give the set a 4 1/2 -5 star review now. Picture with HD cable and Oppo 980 DVD player is awesome."
3,No traigan el TV con Sky Box,"El producto aún no ha llegado a mi casa y la compra se realizó el 28 de diciembre!!! Amazon sí entregó oportunamente el TV a la dirección de mi POBox en Miami, pero Sky Box ha tenido un retraso no justificado y a esta fecha no me han traído el TV."
3,high pitched noise...,"Samsung LNT3253H 32"" LCD HDTVGreat TV, but after about an hour started making a high pitched noise,even on mute (it isnt the speakers). The noise would fluctuate depending on the brightness of the screen.I am returning it."
2,chirping cricket noise in my LN-T3253H,"After trying two new power supplies, my lnt3253h still chirps like a cricket on the 480i channels. Not on the 720i or 1080i channels. On a 480i channel, you mute the sound and can hear it clearly. In all fairness, the repair service (Kansas City area) people were nice, and did reduce the amount of sound somewhat. Guess we are going to call them back..."
5,The best TV,"UPS WAS ON TIME ,,,,THE TV IS THE BEST ONE I HAVE HAD,,,,,,WE LOVE IT YOU SHOULD BUY THIS TV"
2,Disenchanted with Samsung TV's,"This is the second Samsung 32"" LCD TV I have purchased. The first lasted just over 2 years. Then no picture but sound. Out of warranty. Fix was quoted at $400 to $450. TV is headed for the trash. New Samsung TV shows up. There is a loud buzzing sound that comes from the TV. Called Amazon. This TV goes back. I have learned my lesson with Samsung TV's. Check out the discussion forum regarding this TV. There is a rather large post regarding problems with the power supply with this TV. Lesson learned. Check the discussion forums.UPDATE: February 18, 2008. Called Amazon & ordered a Toshiba. I am waiting for delivery and was still putting up with the high pitched whistle. Now the lcd went bad and displays a jumbled picture. Read the discussion forum and avoid this TV. The one good thing is if you do decide to gamble on this set Amazon will take care of you if it does go bad. I am very happy with Amazon and their delivery company Eagle."
4,good tv,"Bought this TV after reading review i found here and ill say the picture looks great i think the game picture is better than my 47"" Sony HDTV in living room, Again good TV you wont regret your purchase ^_~"
2,Not sure yet,We bought this tv at the end of November. A month later it started making a sqealing noise. We contaced Samsung and they directed us to a local repair shop. The tv was in the shop for about 2 weeks. Within an hour of having it back the sqealing noise started again. It has now been back at the shop for another repair. Not sure how this will end. If we had to do it again we would have spent more money and bought this at a local store for easier return. Now we have a brand new tv that has had repairs.
2,Problems - Audio,"I just set up the TV as a family Christmas present. It has an audio problem - a high pitched whine that begins after about 20 minutes of use. It happens after it warms up and won't go away. The digital picture is good. The analog channels are not so good. But, the noise is driving me nuts. Others have had the same problem with audio according to the Amazon Blog. Now I must begin the process with Amazon to return it rather than ""give a more detailed description of the problem"" after contacting Samsung Customer Service. Think twice about buying this 32"" model HDTV until Samsung gets their act together."
2,"Great picture quality, but not worth the headaches","I had this TV set up in my bedroom for about two weeks when I began to get the dreaded audio dropout issue. Until that point my fingers were crossed as everything else about the TV was great. Picture quality, the many features, and even the speakers were great. It is absolutely breathtaking with HD content. As soon as the audio cut out a few times, it was back to the store and not with another Samsung given their horrible record of customer service. It was still within my return period, so I didn't want to hesitate given the similar problems faced by so many others.If you have the patience to deal with Samsung or other places for repairs, then I would say keep it. I personally think that it is ridiculous to need to have a 14 day old, $1000 TV repaired. Too bad, because everything else about the set is great. Maybe I'm being to picky, but when I spend that much money on a television I believe it should be flawless."
4,Totally satisfied,"Delivered two days before promised, product was unwraped and checked to make sure it worked before the delivery man left with the unwanted wrapping."
3,"Shows potential, but no JP","I've always been a fan of Jack O'Neal's writting throughout JackOPierce's albums, but American Horse (JP minus Cary) really seems to be missing something. The songs seem emptier without Cary's singing and hyper/mushy attitude, and their replacement guitarist doesn't add much by way of vocals. Basically, the sound that many of us loved in JP is gone. However, Jack is a great musician himself, and after a while the band may succeed in creating its own great sound. All curious JP fans should buy the album, but hopefully later recordings will improve."
3,syncopated snare,"If there was a button that eliminated the syncopated snare drum riffs that fill this album, I might be able to enjoy it. Everything else is fine, not overwhelmingly great. How did it get such glowing reviews? Perhaps I am out of the loop or not doing the correct drugs.Your mileage may vary..."
3,? black hat saloon,is this the rusty wier of 'the black hat saloon'? would like to have info on old albums/cds ...
4,David's,"This C.D. is good. I too would love to have his music on Cd's. I can't believe someone hasn't produced them. It would be a shame if Rusty's music became lost due to Cd's. I still have the old albums, just no turntable."
2,lacks excitement for such an exciting place,"I received this book as a gift. After reading a few chapters, I felt like I was back in school reading a required text book. Although I do not live in South Beach, I go there frequently and find the atmosphere very colorful, lively and fun.This book showed none of that. In fact, I found it tedious and boring. At the very least, it should have had some colorful photographs showing some of the beautiful sights and capturing some of the excitement of Miami Beach. I am not clear why I was given this book as a gift except perhaps my friend received it also as a gift. The author does deserve a good deal of credit for all the information that was collected as does anyone who puts that much time and effort into any project."
1,Audio Functions fail after the 90 day warranty,Purchased in November 08 for X-Mas gift and all audio functions stopped working in mid April.
1,"Totally useless, unintelligible speech.","I bought these and expected that they be better than the Uniden GMR 1448-2CK walkies I already have (that work just fine). Not the case! Speech is very hard to understand. While my Unidens are loud and clear over any distance I've tried, the Motorolas sound terrible at every distance. You can barely make out what the other person is saying. All of its cool functions are useless if you can't hear the other person!Seriously, don't even remotely consider buying these. The guy at a retailer where I bought them said they get several of them returned every week!"
2,Miss my older models,"We had some older motorolas, now discontinued, that after a few years of abuse on the farm needed replacement. We ordered a bunch of these T8500's and they really suck. The voice quality is bad, hard to understand people, and the belt clips are cheap, cheap, cheap."
1,Useless due to poor noise quality,"The unit is cheap, appears to be solidly made, the batteries last a long time, the range is good - up to 4km in a straight line if there is no hills or trees between radios but the noise quality is so bad you cannot understand what the other person is saying. This poor noise quality makes the radio useless so I would stay away from this model."
1,Don't waste your money,"I've had these for two years. Used on 2 ski trips. Tried it in the cars on the way, they had very bad voice clarity. Very bad on the mountain, had clear line of sight less than 100 yards and nothing. Only good if you're in shouting distance, but don't want to yell at each other. The NOAA reports were the only good thing about these radios. I put them away after and haven't touched for 2 years, they're both dead. I expected the batteries to be dead, so I put regular AA batteries in. They don't even start up now, only turns on the backlight and power light. Every few power cycles, I'll get the LCD screen to flash some of the symbols, but then it fades out.Buy something else, these are junk, I wouldn't even get them for my 5 year old nephew to play with, if they paid me"
4,Good for the money,We bought these for my daughter instead of a cheap toy pair of walkie talkies. We use them all over the place and have no problem with reception. We've taken them to parks and on camping trips and never had problems.
2,Not so good in the cold for me,"I got a three pack from costco of this model for winter skiing and find they are defective below 0 *C (32F) approx. When they are cold the push-to-talk button seems to reset the radio like it was turned off then on again, they beep and vibrate but no transmission is sent.Think I'll have to return these."
1,Do NOT buy!!!!!!!,"I will be taking the radios back tomorrow! They are TERRIBLE!!!We were about 30' away from each other, and still had difficulty hearing. The volume of the radios will not go high enough to hear comfortably. Even at maximum, the volume is quite low, however the ""roger"" beep is quite loud. And even when you can hear, words keep cutting in and out. How can Motorola sell this junk???? The older radios were MUCH better."
2,Disappointed,"We just bought these yesterday, charged them up and decided to try it out in the house (read instructions too). I was a good 50+ feet away with doors closed and I could JUST make out my husband if I strained my ears enough. The reception on his end with cutting my voice out and he heard a lot of static.Not worth the price we paid, we'll be returning it asap."
1,"Horrible product, better off with two cans and some string","This product is absolutely terrible. We originally bought a pair of these from Target to use for hunting. After charging up the batteries, we tried to use them from about 40 feet apart and could barely make each other out. The sound quality is terrible and the transmission quality in general is poor and unreliable. Do not buy these."
1,Terrible Range,"The T8500 claims to have an optimum range of 18 miles. I live in flat farm country. It couldn't get any flatter. We tried most of the channels, tried turning the digital filter on and off, and the best range we could get was one mile. Beyond that, the caller was choppy at best. Very ""staticky"" at 300 feet. Definately not worth the money I paid for them. I agree with the review above...you could do better by holding up signs...I am returning mine tomorrow."
1,Avoid this product,"Anything more than one star is too generous. The worst thing is the (rechargable) battery life. Suppose you are using these to keep in touch out in the woods. If you are out there for more than about 4 hours, your battery will be dead.You can't keep these in the charging unit. It will damage the battery. So, you have to remember to come back and remove them after a couple of hours.If anything the range is less than the cheap set we bought years ago at a sporting goods chain. That cheapie was rated for two miles and better in every way than this supposedly high-quality Motorola. We could leave those on all day without worrying about killing the battery.The cheapie had the clip built in. This unit has a detachable clip that is easily lost.You are not likely to be happy with this product even if someone gives it to you. There is simply nothing good about it whatsoever."
5,Best Spanish preparation book EVER!,"I am moving to the Dominican Republic in January 2010. I bought this book to learn simple phrases and words to prepare me. I've had it about a month and with 5 months to go before I move I feel that this is the best thing ever! It has so many words and it even breaks certain vocabulary up according to the circumstance (i.e health store or travel). MOst of all, it even has the promounciation under the word. Gracias - gratheeyas! A definite MUST HAVE if you want to learn spanish. Good luck!"
4,an overlooked gem,"Campy, colorful and eerie, this is one of my favorite horrors. There is a tense and wonderful chemistry between Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters which keeps things going even when the pace of the script occasionally flags. This is marred by some awkward production values, but there is also a marvelously old-fashioned quality that enhances this film, and makes its more shocking moments stand out in relief. It all points toward a creepy, unhappy ending which is nevertheless mordantly amusing. Highly reccomended for fans of the ""Baby Jane"" school of film fear. (Not coincidentally by the same author.) Deserves rediscovery."
2,"Terrible acting, terrible dialogue, terrible movie",Definitely worth missing. Definitely not worth paying to see this. Definitely not a horror movie. Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
2,John Steinbeck Meets Baby Jane!,"Pretty terrible but kind of fascinating in its own way; it's basically a camp variation of ""Of Mice and Men"". Reynolds and Winters run a children's talent school so Debbie can have some musical numbers; she plays George to Winters' screw-loose, rabbit-fixated Lenny and when we finally do find out What's the Matter with Helen there are DEAD RABBITS EVERYWHERE! Everyone always makes fun of Winters in ""The Poseidon Adventure"" but she has to be seen to be believed here. This is probably the worst movie either woman ever put their name to. (Although an argument could be made for Winters' performance in ""Delta Force""; it's the Matterhorn of bad acting.)"
1,Horrible JAF gifts experience,"I ordered cake stands from JAF gifts for my wedding. They arrived broken. One of the legs wasn't even attached to the stand. I followed the procedures to return it, calling first and shipping it back within seven days. However, JAF never refunded my money. Now they say by sending it to the return address as indicated on their paperwork, not one in an email, it is my fault that I didn't know the paper work with return instructions didn't have their correct address on it. When I call, they put me on hold for about half an hour and then say a superviser will call me back. Essentially, they stole the price of the stands. I have the tracking information showing they received the broken stands back. Seriously, if you are considering buying from JAF gifts, run. They have horrible customer service and poor quality products."
5,I ordered a total of 5 of these LOVE LOVE LOVE them!,First I ordered 3 of them for cupcakes for my nieces wedding they were so beautiful I ordered 2 more. I have used these many times in many ways and configurations. Highly recommend these! LOVE THEM!
2,The old version is better,"I saw an copy of the 1912 edition (my grandmother's) and wanted to get a copy for my children. I was so happy to find that it was in print again, but so disappointed when the book arrived: the colors in the modern version are off, sometimes entirely wrong, and the quality of the pictures is not as good. The original cover was better, and I wonder how the publisher could make so many mistakes with the colors. A real disappointment, but I hope that another publisher takes it up and reissues it with true colors.The text is still charming and the basic drawings are fine."
2,Could have been MUCH better,"The problem I had with this book is the manner with which it was written.It was written in a very assuming way, as if the authors believed you knowwhat they are talking about; this was awfully pretentious, since it's meantto be an introduction as opposed to an improvement on prior knowledge.Also, there were VERY confusing transitions. For instance, they would mentionsomething they were going to talk about, deviate and go off tangent for afew pages, then start again on the topic with no clean modulation.Varian has a few chapters in his Microeconomics book that makes many (but notall) of the same points as this book, only he does it in a more illustrative,easy to follow, and even exciting manner."
1,"Very sad, don't finance this kind of cruelty.","Cheap terrible and cruel video. I hastily ordered it thinking it was a wildlife video. (I buy tons of items and this was just hasty). I couldn't stop myself from watching the walrus hunt and I must say whoever thinks this hunting is time well spent is just a total loser.It could hardly be called ""hunting,"" when these sweet, innocent beasts just sit there, huddled for warmth or are sleeping on an iceberg and these retarded losers pick them off.Hopefully the ""hunters"" will become the hunted one of these days- by a polar bear or schizophrenic eskimo."
5,Great Reading,"A good book to read. Lots of practical helps for everybody.The content is filled with suggestions to help people live a better life. A fulfilled life at home, in the community, at work, and in the church. Everybody should read this book."
4,Startling Ideas About True Happiness,"In this paradigm-busting book, Patrick Morley challenges your comfort zone with neglected biblical insights about happiness that many have been afraid to utter in this me-first generation.You already know that money and stuff won't make you happy, don't you? Are you ready for some reality? ""Ten Secrets for the Man in the Miror"" offers life-changing insights about the nature of true happiness and how to attain it.Concise and engaging, this book is perfect for the on-the-go man in search of a guiding purpose the rat rate can't begin to offer."
5,Klein is expensive but top quality.,Handy #1 square drive driver to go along with the #2 driver. You'll be surprised how many things now have the #1 square drive in addition to the slotted/phillips head.
5,The Case Against the Mission Myth,"It is a pity that there isn't a book summarizing the case against the Mission Myth for younger readers, but guided by their parents, fourth grade students bound to do their history project could profit from the understandings this book shares. Jackson and Castillo present a challenging summary of evidence that shows the devastating effect that the Franciscan-led colonization of California had on its native peoples. The book is controversial because it undermines the case for the canonization of Junipero Serra by pointing out the moral contradictions inherent in the foundation of the missions. Older students (advanced high school and college) will profit by reference to this work."
1,"Yuppie tries to discover self, but never finds the world","If this book came with a money back guarentee, I would ask for my money. The wonderful cover design, the excellent paper and fancy graphics made me fell that the publishers thought this story was really worth promoting. But any cruising story that states several times that cruising is fixing your boat in a series of exotic places, is definitely dumb. I would not want my cruising partner to read this, it makes the whole thing sound boring. Not one real personal encounter with local people - socializing in this book is just with other sailors from the same social and financial rank. Could have met these same folks at my marina. I though going out to see the world meant really mingling - but then if you have to spend so much time fixing a boat, who has time for anything else? Too bad the writer - who is very concise and clear, did not have more romance in her soul, or more time to get away from her boat."
4,Real Good Grass,"These guys sing and play some of the best bluegrass today. I first saw them two years ago at IBMA in Louisville and have been a fan since then. Their vocal harmonies are spooky they're so tight. They are all great instrumentalists. They put on an awesome live show and this album, like the first one, simply rocks. BUY IT!"
2,Basics is the key word,"Contrary to what other reviews indicated, the DVD over emphasized the basics of shooting; consequently, it was pretty boring. It is geared to people who know little if anything about gun handling and shooting. A few good practices and tips, but not nearly enough information on advanced shooting techniques which is what I was looking for."
1,a Marine's review;,"I think this is a typical production for what they want civilians to see , I was trained in the 1960""s at Paris Island ,SC and The training was the Best, They train you to shoot right . the film is for none marines ,our class was short and to the point , thin we hit the grass for snap in , followed by range week and shooting to Qualify and every one did that or they got there ass ran off in PT .Sargent of U. S. Marines"
4,Huge display,"Not the best for the bedroom. Display is so large that it can keep you awake. But for those with poor vision, excellent clock."
4,Poor choice for your bedroom,"I bought this clock, intending to place it on a shelf located about 6 feet from my bed. Even in that spot, I found it was much too bright (on the LOW brightness setting). I tried it in the corner of my living room, and found that this worked much better -- the time can be read easily, in all types of light. So, my very strong advice is this: do NOT buy this clock for your bedroom; it is a good choice for the corner of your living room."
3,Just O.K.,"If you want huge numbers, this is the biggest there is. The 2 1/2"" numbers are easy to read from across the room, but that doesn't mean you'll be able to read it with your glasses off. The display dimmer does dim it down to an acceptable level for sleeping. The alarm is loud enough if you're not a super sound sleeper. The buttons are easy enough to use. The overall feel of the clock is cheap and plasticy. The tilt back is loose and feels really flimsy. The AM/PM light on mine flicked until I gave it a smack. The description doesn't list the dimensions, but it's big: 8 1/2"" W x 5 1/2"" H x 3 1/2"" DI'm not delighted with it and may try a different clock."
5,Nice Clock,I bought several of these clocks for my family members and they love it. No matter the time of day you can clearly see the time display. I'm not sure why some reviews state that the display is too bright in a dark room. I have mine set on low and it is not a problem. I've had to buy some rubber sticky pads to keep the clock from sliding when you touch the control buttons. The bottom of the clock tends to move easily when handling the clock. I've also noticed with some reviews that the clock does not stay in the desired viewing angle position. I'm referring to the adjustable viewing angle of the clock where it is adjustable from 0-90 degrees. Perhaps those people have a defective model. I've been able to adjust it to any angle and it stays in place.
3,Geneva Clock Co 4584E Elgin Electric Alarm Clock,"The marketing material said that there was an option to select between blue or red lit numbers - red is the only choice. It is supposed to have a battery backup but when the cord is pulled from the outlet nothing displays, however, the clock has kept time when electrically re-powered. Several new high-quality 9 volt batteries were used to perform the test to confirm that the battery is not the problem. I would give 3-stars for the large letters and ease of operation."
5,The best clock ever!,This clock is just right for me. Its just because I have bad sight so I needed a big desplay. I think this is the only clock that has such a big display. It works great as an alarm too. I just love it!
2,Disappointed,"I was happy that this product was just as I thought it would look and the size I wanted, but it gained 2 hours of time overnight. The return process so far has been very easy and efficient. This process is not complete as I just discovered the problem and initiated the return. This was a Christmas gift."
3,Too Much For Me,This is very loud and very bright (even on dim). It will wake you up like a smack to the face. I returned it.
4,unreadable from some angles,"It would work on a bedside table. However, I want to set it on a shelf, and you cannot read the time if you are looking up at it, because of the way the base proturdes, this cannot be adjusted. I just unpacked it and I'm sending it back."
3,Too bright,"The numbers on the clock certainly are huge, the biggest I was able to find, but the clock was so bright it kept us up at night. The ""dim"" setting is only marginally dimmer than the bright setting."
2,Not An Accurate Timekeeper,"The clock runs very fast, gaining about a minute every day or so. To keep it accurate to the minute, it needs to be reset about every third day or so."
5,Electric Alarm Clock,This clock has large number readings for night-time. The clock will lay back if the time bothers you at night.
3,Time cannot be read with regular power off,"This clock has a backup battery operated clock that keeps the time when the regular power is lost. The problem with this backup function is that it does not feed the time to the main clock display and there is no way to tell the time until the regular power is restored. The alarm does function during the power outage, if you have set it. Gotta know the time."
1,Does not work,"These hours is a very good display of large Numbers., and well illustrated. Nothing good to say I can't. They don't work. One hour behind at 15 minutes. It is a pity"
1,delaying,bery bad quality plus every 12 hour5s it delays 2 hours something terrible I never saw a watch loke that
1,Not working on arrival,"The clock is bright, large and easy to set. However, several segments of the digital display were not working upon arrival. I ordered a different clock as a replacement and that, too, was DOA. No more clocks from Amazon for me!"
2,Works but it's Fragile,"The clock works, but when they said it was ""adjustable"" you have to be careful. It sits upright on my night stand but a fan breeze will make it flop over. It isn't exactly sturdy in its construction so I am waiting for it to get creamed when one of my Ninja Chihuahuas knocks it off on the floor. I had to replace my old Radio Shack digital clock when the buttons began to stick ... couldn't set the alarm anymore. And I should have gone to Radio Shack and gotten another one like it. My old one was ""only"" 12 years old and had been roughly handled."
2,numbers to bright for night use,"even on dim setting the numbers are so bright that they light up the bedroom at nite, a true dimmer setting would have been useful so that the numbers could been seen in the dark without lighting up the room like a spotlight"
4,Good clock,I use the clock in the Kids room. I wish the cord was longer. I have it mounted on the wall to make it easier for them to see. The numbers are big and bright enough. You can adjust the brightness
5,2 in 1- what could be better?,"I love the Final Destination series. In my opinion, the 2nd one is the best one. The best thing about these movies is how the people die. Blood and gore all the way! It's amazing to me how these movies made death seem like a predator preying upon its victims. If you see 1 then you have to see all 3. That's just the way it is."
3,where is the free movie ticket?,"I purchased this today and it clearly states that it comes with a free movie ticket to Final Destination 3. I searched through the whole package, both DVDs and bonus disc and could not find the ticket? where is it....or have I just fallen into an advertising scam?"
5,Two of the best movies!,Final Destination is a great Thriller. You'll always be on the edge of your seat.
3,Good as background music,These cd's are good if you like native american type flute music. However if you play it loud it can really be annoying after a while. I only play it as soft background music when I work on the computer.
5,JUST WHAT I HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR!,This toaster oven is just what I had been looking for. It is spacious enough to bake a whole chicken as well as a pan of lasagna or baked ziti. And it is backed by the brand of Black & Decker which is always a plus. My previous toaster oven was also a B&D only smaller. It lasted me 9 years. I am very pleased with my purchase!
1,confusing interface,Unclear usability.Difficult to understand how to adjust the temperature or the time.
1,Not what I expected at all,"When I first bought this, I thought it was going to be a scientific book. It turns out to be just ramblings from some guy. It wasn't even a book, it was more like a pamphlet. I was not happy that I had paid... for some propaganda. If you are looking for a book about truth, stick to something else in the New Age section because this book/flier is not worth it...."
1,Below Average Work on Tiger I,"I consider myself a collector of Tiger I books and I have read a lot on this awesome tank over the years. This title by Roger Ford is somewhat disappointing. The content is shallow and the illustrations are sub-standard. I have seen cutaways of tanks from many books but the one in this book is just a joke. I guess this book is aimed at those who have no previous knowledge of this tank. Even another book from the same publisher MBI on T-34 deserves 3 stars.If you are a serious Tiger I historian or enthusiast, don't bother to buy this book. You may look for the new book from Jean Restayn ""Tiger I on the Eastern Front"", which is a much better presentation of Tiger I."
3,The Tiger Tank,"This is a good resource of general information on the Tiger. The book covers many of the highlights of the Tiger I Ausf. E's service record. Brief treatment is given to Wittman's successes and demise. There is no coverage given to other Tiger aces such as Otto Carius. Some details of the Tiger's operational history have been omitted. For the Scale model enthusiatst, the book does have cutaway veiws showing the interior, and some photo's. There are also a few color plate showing paint schemes. Additional detail will have to be obtained from other sources. This book is an good value for the price. The serious historian, however, might want to look into other sources."
3,A good starter book on the Tiger tank of WWII,"This book is well written and researched with plenty of b/w photographs and detailed information on the history and development of the German Tiger tank of WWII. Less impressive are the discussions on the role and tactics of the Tiger tank in combat. One plus is the many rare and unusual photographs in the book, some of which I have not seen anywhere else.But I have to mention that the accompanying illustrations are few and rather poorly done. I would have liked more and better illustrations since the b/w photographs don't really show the different paint schemes and markings well. Also, the description of the Tiger's armament is too brief - there are no detailed pictures of the 88mm gun or the different ammuntion types.Overall it would be a good buy as a first book but if you already have books on the topic, there probably won't be anything new here except perhaps the excellently done history and development of the Tiger."
5,Porgy and Bess,"I remember watching this movie starring Sidney Poiter and Dorothy Dandridge, late one night after my mom told me to turn off the tv. I have never seen another verison that could top this one.Please, please release this on DVD. I would love to have this movie in my collection."
5,Release this version of Porgy & Bess for Everyone,"This is truly the definitive version! It is meticulously filmed and the music is ""to die for""! Yes, the major characters are dubbed but who wasn't back then? It has stellar performances from Mr. Poitier, Miss Bailey, Mr. Davis and the brilliant and sublime Miss Dorothy Dandridge! Let's hope all parties concerned will come to an agreement soon and this magnificent work of art will be available in it's entirety for future generations to see and hear. WE NEED THE DVD!!!"
5,Release the Gershwin Archives,"AS I understand it the reason this film has not been released in any video format is because at the time of the film's cinematic release the Gershwin Estate were not happy with it.They have been sitting on it ever since. You'll notice that you can't get ""Rhapsody In Blue"" the only Gershwin biopic made to date starring Robert Alda as George Gershwin, on video either."
5,Perhaps one of the finest musicals ever made,"I grew up on this musical in Coney Island NY. We were too poor for a vcr, I can see from the date of the movie that I was ten years old in '59. I remember having the album and playing it until it was worn out, and then still playing it. If you have not seen this musical, you are in for a treat. When She sings 'what you want with Bess', be ready to be frozen right where you are seated, it is that beautiful. With this being released now, oh Lord, I'm glad I'm not on my way."
1,Bad Transfer of a Degraded Print,"What I received was not a Region 1 video, but a Region All with cover art work for ""Porgy und Bess"" (evidently from a germanic speaking country) with a run time of 115 minutes instead of the 138 minutes as originally released. The audio is not too bad. The video is a bad transfer of a fuzzy, degraded, washed out technicolor print. This was released by Blax Films."
5,Porgy and Bess,"I saw Porgy and Bess as a young child and I keep hoping that I will see the movie on TMC, A@E, and Warner Classic. I watched the movie once with my mother and I know she would love to see Porgy and Bess again. I also would like to share one of the best movie of all times with my friends and family. Please let me know when the movie is available on DVD or VHS."
5,ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE BEST MUSICALS EVER WRITTEN /PERFORMED,"I searched for this on video and now I search for it on DVD. The music, the story, the acting are absolutely unsurpassed. I saw the movie when it first came out and I purchased the soundtrack. My recording has long since been lost, although I do own it on CD performed by others. This story is a part of America's history! It is beyond me how anyone could possibly object to it's release. It is absolutely beautiful. I hope and pray that I will live long enough to obtain a copy of this masterpiece."
4,I Really Want To See This,"I am disappointed this classic is not available. Now that I'm older I feel I can appreciate the works of these fine trailblazers in this theatrical piece. I've heard some of the songs and have seen their work as well as the artist's views about the work, please allow those of this generation the chance to view history."
2,Porgy and Bess(1959),"Porgy and Bess (1959) is a must have for my movie library. I saw it once on TV as a teen and it so captured my attention. Such a moving performance, one that I have not forgotten and would love to see it again and again. I have been searching for this movie starring Sidney Poitier and Dorothy Dandrige for years. Please release it very soon as VHS/DVD, this is truly a beautiful classic."
2,Porgy & Bess overdue for release to home viewers,I saw the Poitier/Preminger film in Cambridge UK and bought the Soundtrack [!] LP. As we know the stars' singing voices were provided by other artistes .... I did acquire a washed out VHS copy from ?Canada but we should be allowed to see this in full colour and with modern sound. It may not be a masterpiece but it is not so bad that it needs to be suppressed for another 40 years ...
5,I Miss It Too!,"I haven't seen this movie since the 70s; and I miss it; I think it's a shame that they don't show it on TV much less on video; All I know is that I used to watch on Channel 11 in NYC, all the time, then all of a sudden, they stopped putting it on TV; Such a shame;Ok, there are stereotypes in here,but, remembering what you saw as a child, you just want to see it again; Especially since it is one of the very few films that Dorothy Dandridge starred in and u just cannot see; I think it's a shame;"
5,Contact the rights holder to get this on DVD,"The rights to this wonderful film belong to samuelgoldwynfilms.com. Maybe drop them a line and if enough people do it, perhaps they will release it."
4,Inspiring,"I have to say that this book is the most inspiring book I've ever read. It may not be the best form of fiction, and most entertaining, but it will definitley keep you on the edge of your seat as you read. One point in the book I actually shouted out because I got so excited, not even meaning to. And I was in a crowd full of people. It will leave you crying, and rejoicing. It seems to be based on a real person"
4,Don't miss this book!,"A good friend told me to put down what I was currently reading and read this book. I was not disappointed. Mr. Jenkins creates a character of such faith, you will wish you knew her. Standing firm, she never wavers in any circumstance life throws at her. Just be sure you read this book with a box of kleenex at your side. You'll need it."
1,The story of a female Job,"I read this book expecting to find Mr. Jenkins' superior fiction, but instead was disapointed. I found Elisabeth to be unlikeable and fake in spite of her inspiring aim to let her life be an example of obedience. Her trials and tribulations are so frequent that they cease to affect the reader's emotions at all and begin to bore. In the Left Behind series, Mr. Jenkins manages to instill the characters with hope and joy in spite of horrible times. In Though None Go With Me, Mr. Jenkins manages to make bitterness and depression the prevailing theme."
5,An avid christian novels reader,"Once I got to her decision to serve God at all costs, I cried through the rest. It reminded me of all the times I have rededicated my life to Him as a teen.I doubt that I could have persevered as she did. What a challenge to me to continue to walk as Christ asks me to walk."
5,Inspiring!,I can't say enough positive things about this book! I highly recommend it to everyone. I'm sure you will grow to love the main character as I did. This book had a tremendous impact on my life! I will never be the same.
5,Exceptional Read,"I finished reading THOUGH NONE GO WITH ME last week and the characters are still in my heart and mind. As a Christian wife and mother, I was inspired by Elisabeth's thought and prayer life. Just when I thought she could bear no more pain, she in fact faced more suffering. My faith has been strengthened through the obedience of this godly woman. Jerry Jenkins' books touch my heart and this one is exceptional.Though None Go with Me"
4,Exciting to see how she got through everything!,"This book kept me wanting to go back and read more! Elizabeth seems too good to be true. Her life, from a child to adult is filled with problems none of us would ever experience. Her dedication to the Lord is amazing and leads her to do things to ""walk the walk"". Sometimes she seems almost ""holier than thou"" but it is refreshing to read about someone keeping their commitments and promises."
2,Depressing Read,"Unfortunately, I did not find this book inspiring or entertaining as others have. I loved the Left Behind series and was excited to read another book by this author. Very disappointed. The character development was fine but the reading at times was tedious due to lack of chapter breaks and the never ending tragedy without a balance of peace. A lifetime of tradegy was the theme of the book. I felt that some of the assumptions were not theologically accurate. The ending did not seem plausible and did not redeem the storyline. I do not recommend this book."
5,Fantastic Book!!!,"This book is a great read. I found Elizabeth's character to be completely believable and refreshing. This book will wake you up to realize that life isn't always a rose garden, there are definitly thorns along the way. But, Elizabeth teaches us how to bear the pain and remain steadfast, unmovable and always abounding!!! I recommend this book to anyone and everyone who will read it. It's wonderful!"
1,Depressing.,"As an avid reader of Christian books, I thought this book would be inspirational. It turned out to be one of the most depressing books I've ever read. The heroine of the story turns out to be far more loving and faithful than God is! Though God is faithless throughout the story, she remains faithful! A bit of a turn-around on scripture, I'd say! Readers, if you want to read some wonderful inspirational sagas about God's faithfulness during hard times, read Francine Rivers' writings!"
3,Power Yoga for Weight loss,"Someone please tell me why Brian feels the need to rhyme so much in this video? (ex: ""now reach high to the sky off the thigh. . . blah, blah) It's distracting and annoying, as are his long-winded narrations, grating brooklyn accent, and numerous mentions about how he ""just made up this routine"" and it's something ""no one has seen before.""I have to fast forward past his never-ending explanations, and then when you get to the actual yoga, he'll do maybe one or two sun salutions and that's it. It's a lot of work for a short workout. However, if you can look past all that stuff, and the fact it's only about 40 min. long, all in all it is a pretty good workout. I just skip all his nonsense and then replay the sun salutations until I feel like I got enough of a workout."
4,Fantastic book about postmodernism,"This book was an excellent resource to learn about postmodernism. Not only did it help to define what it is (if that is really possible), but it also helped the reader to identify with the postmodern generation. I happen to be from the postmodern generation, and it helped to me understand alot about where my generation comes from. Of course, this book also dealt with ministry in relation to the postmodern generation. I would have given it 5 stars, but there were some social discussions (environment, etc) in which Sweet seemed to assume a particular side was correct. I know this wasn't a book dealing with global warming, but still, the political stances on some issues rubbed me a little wrong. However, don't let that keep you from reading this book. It is absolutely essential to anyone ministering to the postmodern world."
1,Dissatisfied,"Good morning,I am very unhappy with this vendor. I have not yet received this book. I am going to contact them again but as of 11/25/11 I have not received the book. This is unusual but I would like it resolved.John Shultz"
4,Getting De-Churched and opening up your mind.,"Recently, the staff of the church where I work read through this book in preparation for a two-day brainstorming session on reaching our culture. This book opened up our minds and caused us to think in new directions. One of Sweet's pleas is for Christians to get De-churched. To get outside our normal view and begin to evaluate why we do what we do. The culture today thinks that the church is an unloving, boycotting machine that is out to destroy their way of life. If we are so arrogant to think that we can fit them into the box that we have labeled ""church"", then we will be swept away by the coming tsunami. I highly recommend this book for anyone in ministry because it acts as such a mind trigger, stimulating your thoughts and ideas and forcing you to be creative about your plans from ministry in the next century. Postmodernism may be a somewhat new concept for many of you in ministry, but it's time to learn. God Bless"
5,"Thought provoking, slow reading, and worth it!","Some books I read in days... a momentary tickle. Some books I read in months... they mess with my head and change my life. This is one of those, and I heartily recommend it to anyone who wants to think about changes in our culture. I'd even recommend it to business people who want to understand their customers.So where are you? Modern? Post-modern? We take so much for granted (everyone must think like me!). I'm becoming more delightfully post-modern every day, and I like it! Armed with a new appreciation for culture, and a new appreciation for Jesus himself, I'm pondering these questions: * what am I doing now that's working, and why is it working? * what doesn't seem to work any more? * if we reinvented church from basic principles in our increasingly post-modern community, what would it look like?Now I've gotta go read those next two books in the trilogy: AquaChurch and SoulSalsa!"
4,A Definite Post-Modern Read,"SoulTsunami is a difficult read, not because of its content, but rather the way in which it is written. Sweet's definitive post-modern writing style forces the reader to slow down and chew on nearly every page. He invents new words and uses them to excess. Incredibly frustrating.But I could not put the book down. Sweet's insights into culture, and how the church should lead rather than follow the culture, are amazing. Not for the faint at heart, but a required read for anyone trying to reach the ""Net-Gens""."
4,Richard Scarry's Books,"This was my first purchase of this book, but I know I love some of his other books and figured this one had to be great, too."
5,My favorite Young Children's Book!,I bought this for a new baby because I read these to my children when they were little. This is my favorite series of learning books. The characters are charming and a child forms attachment to their continuing stories while learning words and occupations and names of everything around them.
4,Great starter and reinforcer,This books offers a great start for the littlest ones for knowing common items and also serves as a great reinforcement for parents who want to ensure they are actively teaching their children about the world around them.
5,This holds their attention for a long time!,"I have 19-month-old twins. One of them LOVES books; the other is very energetic and won't often sit still long enough to get through even a simple board book. However, they both love this book. They find it endlessly entertaining. We have to be careful with it since they're not good with paper pages yet (I'd love a smaller board book version for 1-year-olds!) but this is a great book and a true classic. I remember reading it when I was little; the illustrations are adorable and there is much to look at on every page. Great vocabulary-builder, too!"
2,Snide and Condescending,"The underlying premise of this book is that foreigners who are drawn to Indian gurus are a bunch of gullible fools and Indian gurus pull the wool over everyone's eyes to make money. The writer is obviously coming from a westernized perspective of an Indian embarassed about the ""dirt"" of her own culture. But without the marketing of the Eastern mystical traditions, her book wouldn't have been such a success, would it? Now that globalism has put a Pizza Hut on every corner in New Delhi and all those ""dirty"" Gurus are gone, replaced by the slick types like Deepak Chopra, hope Gita is feeling much better."
3,Useful & entertaining,"Humorous description of overseas visitors looking to India for spiritual enlightenment twenty years ago. I read this while visiting Pune, India, location of Bhagavan Shri Rajnish's ashram, which made it even more appropriate. Very entertaining & perceptive.The book is not about India--it is about Western misperception of India."
3,Amusing but not Moving,"I bought this book while traveling in India. Mehta offers well-written vignettes in which Western hippies make fools of themselves in ""mystic"" India. Several of these vignettes are genuinely, laugh-out-loud funny.Beyond this ""culture clash"" humor, the book makes no deep statements on the interrelationship of Eastern and Western cultures. Perhaps her criticisms were more relevant when a glut of hippies saturated India in the 60s and 70s, but the glut has dried up. In fact, perhaps if more Americans did travel to other nations, including India, and showed a genuine appreciation for other cultures and belief systems, we would all be better off."
3,"Witty at times, cynical at others","Written so as to remind each of us that there's a sucker (or seeker) born every minute, Mehta's book shows us how easy it is to fool gullible Westerners looking for enlightenment, and that there's a big difference between open-hearted curiosity and gullibility. Westerners created a market for gurus, and India filled it. But somewhere among the amusing anecdotes that Mehta relates in a clucking tongue there's a tale that's really rather sad. On the whole, I enjoyed the book and found it witty and amusing, but thought it was perhaps a little satisfied at its own superiority. For anybody thinking about going to India to ""find themselves,"" it would be a good primer."
1,Laughably bad!,"So this is how DC Comics celebrated the 50th anniversary of Batman? Wow! Fifty years of history and DC decided to introduce new terribly forgettable villains and even worse new supporting characters. The entire plot, while being dated, is so inconceivably bad I find it hard to believe it was green lit. Amazing. The art by Denys Cowan was all right but you barely got to see Batman actually in costume. Overall, this is something that only hardcore Bat fans will fan slightly interesting."
2,I've read better,"I know this book has it's fans, but I'm not one. The art's a bit rough and dated for this day and age and the primary mover in the story is a bit too sci-fi for me. Hails back to the day of doomsday devices and plot elements carried along primarily by unexplained technology. I'm a fan, but this wouldn't be the story I'd proselytize with."
3,I liked it,This Howard Hewett Cd seemed to be something forced on the fans of Howard Hewett not that its bad it just that every song on this cd is not so Howard friendly sounds like he just phone in the performace not his usual feeling of love of the songs he is singing not one song on here can truly be recommended but the hardcore fans this gives you something to say the next one will blow you away.
4,One of Howard's most consistent albums.,"This was Howard's second most consistent album (after his 1986 debut ""I Commit To Love""). I especially like the songs produced by Narada Michael Walden and Nick Martinelli. The album's best song was undoubtedly the breathtakingly beautiful Walden-produced ballad ""Can We Try Again?"" which deserved to have been a huge hit (but it wasn't)."
4,Great Book!,"Read this for a class, and loved it! I enjoy historical fiction and how this one interwined with the fairy tale. Great book!"
5,Beautiful Blend of Sleeping Beauty and the Holocaust,"This book is probably one of the best retellings of Sleeping Beauty. Rebecca always loved hearing the story of Sleeping Beauty from her grandmother, but there was an interesting twist in the story the princess was put in her enchanted sleep by a poisonous mist instead of the spindle of the spinning wheel. Right before Rebecca's grandmother dies she tells her that she is Sleeping Beauty. Rebecca decides to find out what her grandmother meant by that and she ends up finding a tragic story about love and loss durring the Holocaust. I would reccomend the reader be at least 13, but I think that people would enjoy this unique retelling of Sleeping Beauty."
5,Holocaust tale given life,"Jane Yolen's Briar Rose is a masterpiece of controlled prose. She allows her main charcter to meander as a sort of ""offbeat"" detective attempting to uncover the secret of her grandmother's early life. It is a holocaust story which illustrates that the gas chamber was neither the only, nor necessarily the most brutal, of the Nazi forms of execution, and it allows the reader to observe the festering process of silence becoming guilt then resentment. The story revisits Yolen's fascination with the fairy tale genre, and allows her to experiment with both allegory and metaphor. This is,however, not a book for academics. It is a powerful tale, easy to read and similarly easy to enjoy. I highly recommend this book to any who realise that the search for the past may reveal skeletons which do not dwell easily in cupboards."
4,An enchanting story...,"""Briar Rose"" ia a well written, enchanting book. Yolen combined the famous fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty and the sad story of the Holocaust together into a moving narritive. Although all of the characters in this book are fictional, Yolen created such vivid descriptions of them you feel as if you know each individual personally. The book's only weakness was the description of Josef Potocki's experience of the Holocaust. This was probably the most important part of the book so Yolen could have elaborated more on his life. ""Briar Rose"" is a book I would reccomend to people from about seventh grade on up. It is a book younger children may not understand. Overall, I think ""Briar Rose"" is a book many young adults will love just as I did."
4,An unexpected fairy tale,"I have read the fairy tale Sleeping Beauty but never like this. The story Briar Rose combines the fairy tale sleeping beauty with the worrifying story of the Holocaust. The grandmother in the story (Gemma), tells the story of sleeping beauty to her three grandchildren named Sylvia, Shanna, and Becca. When Gemma dies, Becca, youngest of the three, promises to her grandmother before she died that she would look for the sleeping beauty. Not really sure what her grandmother meant on her death bed, Becca goes in search of her grandmothers death in a camp in Poland. There Becca finds a man named Josef who tells Becca the story of her grandmothers trials and tribulations as a jewish person living back during the Holocaust. Becca realizes her roots and just what Gemma went through before she died. The author Jane Yolen did a great job twinning together such opposites. I learned a lot from this book and had a good time reading it. I would recommend this book to everyone."
3,Briar Rose,"Briar Rose is a very good mix of Holocaust and Fairy Tail. It was an interesting story of a girl named Rebecca Berlin and her ""Gemma."" Her Gemma had told the story of Briar Rose many times, to her and her two older sisters. They all enjoyed the story but it seems to be that Rebecca enjoyed it the most. The reason I say this is because she is the one who stayed with her Gemma till the end. Her Gemma told Rebecca that she was Briar Rose and she wants Rebecca to find her castle. Rebecca went in search of her grandmother's death camp in Poland. Finally she finds her grandmothers ""friend"" Josef and he told her the heartbreaking story of her grandmother's life as a Jewish person."
5,A wonderful novel mixed with horror and love.,This is a novel about a jouney that a young lady takes to find out her grandmothers past. She finds out that her grandmother went through the holocaust. Within this novel Gemma the grandmother tell her grandchildren about the story of Briar Rose. She later finds out why this story is so important on her jouney. So go out and find this book and unlock the secret of Gemma's life.
2,Dislike,"I thought that Briar Rose was a semi-fair book. What made the book interesting to me was, the book was very similar to the children's story Sleeping Beauty. I also liked how every odd chapter would reminisce to when Becca and her sisters were little girls and their grnadmother would tell them the story of Briar Rose. In my opinion, the book began to drag in the middle. I lost interest in the book from chapters 18-22. When I first began the book, I would have recommended it to others. Since I have now finished the book, i don't think I would recommend it. The tone was very dull, sad, and dreary. It remained that way throughout the rest of the book. This caused the book to ge very boring."
3,Briar Rose,"I did not really enjoy this book. The story of a girl trying to figure out her past is a great idea. However, the story was very dull and boring. Their were times in the story when Jane would ramble on and on about stuff that was not even imporant to the story plot. If you get easy confused this is not the story for you becasue the chapters go back and forth from past to present tense. Jane Yolen seems like a very talented author but this was a very boring story. I did think that the last four chapaters inculding the ending were very clever and intersting. I would not recommend this book."
3,A true disappointment,"When I bought this book, I figured, ""Oh, it's by Jane Yolen. I bet it's really good!"" That just proves that people really shouldn't judge books by thier cover or author. I really thought this book would be one that I wouldn't be able to put down. I also thought I would finish it in like, 3 days. Boy was I wrong. I found this book to be quite boring (especially in the beginning). There were so many times when I found the book would make me drop to sleep. I really expected more from this author. However, to be on the positive side, when a man tells his story about Briar Rose in the book, it get's very interesting. but from there on, it just isn't all that great. the end however, is very cute. But I must agree with other people who have read this book. It really isn't meant for people under 14 or 15. Some of the content is very disturbing. But other than that, this book was so so. I just wish I didn't have to force myself to keep reading."
2,Has content inappropriate for YA readers (violent sodomy),"Plot is forced. Character development is veryincomplete. Family relationships are left dangling. The last third of the book is anadd on that introduces adult subjects by astranger who is suppose to relate Gemma's early history but really describes his own life as agay libertine ""living in the belly of the wolf"" preceding and during WWII"
2,Briar Rose Review,"When I first heard what this book was about, I thought it sounded pretty good. I love re-tellings of fairy tales (like the books by Donna Jo Napoli)and also books about people in times of war or hardship. This book isn't really about any of that. It is more about Becca's (the main character)journey to find out about her grandmother's past. Even though the writing was descriptive and made sense, I thought this book was boring and didn't really have a point"
5,EXCELLENT!!!!!!!,"BRIAR ROSE IS AN EXCELLENT WAY TO LEARN ABOUT HISTORY. MANY FEELINGS ARE FELT BY THE READERS BECAUSE OF THE DESCRIPTIVE WORDS. I LOVE THIS BOOK AND HAVE READ IT TWICE, EACH TIME FEELING THE SAD FEELINGS ALL OVER AGAIN. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE, YOUNG AND OLD."
2,Pass on this one,"The story is interesting in concept but very watered down to what it could have been. The plot is forced, character development is not only incomplete, but I found the characters dull, flat and one-dimensional. This book had great potential but for me I couldn't finish it. There are many more books worth my time than this one."
3,THIS IS A REVIEW (^_^),I like this book because it had little big words and was eay to read. It is a form of sleeping beauty story. it was a good book. i liked how they step up the story. it was eay to read.
3,Briar Rose,"Briar Rose is a story related to Sleeping Beauty. The whole concept of this book is, a young woman by the name of Becca is very close to her Grandmother. Her Grandmother, also known as Gemma, always told her stories as she was growing up about a woman named briar rose. Gemma always told Becca that she was Briar Rose. Becca was the only one who believed her stories. The rest of the family believed Gemma to be crazy. After Gemma died, Becca finds a box with a rose carved into the top of it with old papers and documents inside of it. So Becca goes to Poland to learn everything she can about her grandmother and find out the truth."
3,Good Book,"I really enjoyed this book. It was very well worded and the author created suspense at the right time.This book is very educational on the holocaust and what those people had to go through. I was tearing up in different parts when it was sad. It must have been awful how those people were treated just because of their religeon.I would only recommend this book to people who are mature, as it is a bit ""graphic"" in some places. I really enjoyed it."
3,Could have been more,"I certainly did not expect this book to be an exact following of the tale of Sleeping Beauty. On its own, as a piece of Holocaust fiction, it was better. I have not read any of the other books in this series, so I can not say how well it stuck to the fairy tale genre as compared to the other books. Nonetheless, I found this a creative tale. I do wish it could have been fleshed out more somewhat, as some parts felt rather sparse. What Jane Yolen could have done was either flesh this out more and market it as a piece of Holocaust fiction, or stuck more to the tale of Sleeping Beauty. She did get creative with how she used the tale of Sleeping Beauty, but I wish there could have been more."
3,my review,I liked the book because it was nice to read.It had adventure and a lot of small words.I liked what the book was about.It had history in it.I didnt like the parts about the holacaust......i think that the holocaust was one of the worst things that happened in the history of the world.
5,great book,"Briar rose is a great book, it is a little hard to understand the beggining, but over all it is understandable! Gemma and Becca are very strong characters, Becca was my favorite because she never gave up on finding out about Gemma's true identity!!"
3,Not for Younger (10 to 14) Young Adults,"On Jane Yolen's website, this book is appropriately labeled an adult book. The story is good, but the main characters are in their 20's, the themes are adult including innuendo and explicit sexual (both hetero and homo) references, the horror of the Holocaust is presented, and expletives are interspersed in general conversation."
3,"Interesting Premise, But Not Quite The Fairy Tale As Promised...","I didn't exactly plan on reading this in one sitting, but that is just what happened! It is a fast YA read, with plenty of appeal to adult lovers of fairy tales blended with WWII. Loosely based on the fairy tale, ""Sleeping Beauty"", Yolen updates the story and sets it in Poland during WWII. The history is tragic and the writing is pretty solid, but unfortunately, there is a definite loss of magic that should be at the heart of every fairy tale - retold or not. Still, I did enjoy it - I just hoped for a bit more fairy tale brought into this historical fiction piece."
1,Bad Twist of Fairy Tale and Holocaust,"Seems that many authors are taking advantage of the holocaust, and this is one of the worst. Briar Rose was a beautiful title, but the story lacked a beautiful plot, or a plot at all. There was NO plot! For people looking for a fairytale spinnoff, try THE CLAIMING OF SLEEPING BEAUTY by ANNE RICE, that's a killer."
5,Holocaust Fairytale,"""Briar Rose"" was a captivating fairytale that Becca and her sisters used to listen to their Gemma tell over and over again as little girls. Becca was completely in love with the story and loved the passion that her Gemma used to tell it with. She would have no idea that this fairytale would have such a impact on finding out who her Gemma really was.This story incorporates such a vivid image of what life was like for the prisoners of the holocaust and yet adds an element of romance and imagination. ""Briar Rose"" had me anticipating the next page and the next spin in the plot. In reading this book it gave me a whole new perspective into fairytales and how they are incorporated into real everyday life.It also proves that sometimes fairytales do come true."
3,"Good staory, good intertwining of stories, and BAD (to me) writing style","Hmmm. THis was one of my school reading books this year, and we've just finished it. It was okay. Though I did not like some parts, I could not, for some reason, put it down. The plot summary tells it all. But I do not like Yolen's writing style. I used to like books in this style, which is sort of brutish, yet intertwined with sympathy. It showed me how much I've changed in the sort of book I like. Which was good. This book made me feel sad for Gemma, the old grandmother at the heart of this sad story. It was very sad. I never liked sad books, except for Madame Bovary and 1929. But if you are a teen and you want to learn more about the Holocaust, this book is for you. But I'd take Anne Frank's diary instead."
5,An Intense Experience,"This book is truly great. Yes, the ending may be ""told entirely by a third party"", but how else could it have been told? If you read the book, there is no other way for Becca to have found out her grandmother's roots. I am wondering if the Kirkus reviewer even read the book. This book is so great. I am in awe of Ms. Yolen. She pulled off an extremely difficult task, intertwining the happy-go-lucky, fantasy story of Sleeping Beauty with the monstrous, bloody, horrific reality of World War II and the Nazi Holocaust. This book is masterfully done and I highly recommend it."
2,Good Story - Bad Writing,"My friend bought this book for me, knowing I love fairy tales and the holocaust - and what's better but having them together in one book?! The story was very interesting and I had a hard time putting the book down, wanting to figure out Gemma's secrets. However, the style of writing wasn't very good - she tried too hard at being an adult writer and it wasn't a very good attempt. The sentences were choppy and her descriptions were not very descriptive. I totally liked the comparison between Sleeping Beauty and the Holocaust. But the coincedences weren't very good - Becca ""just happened"" to run into the guy who saved Gemma's life; she ""just happened"" to meet the guy who was in the picture with Gemma. I know it's a fairy tale, but in real life, that's a bit too far fetched. Overall, the story was good, but I didn't enjoy the writing style of the author."
2,Even the rose has its thorns.,"This book was, in my opinion, an O.K. book. In the beginning it was a very slow read. However the pace did pick up a bit towards the end. It had a good story and lesson attached to it but it took awhile to get to it. Over all I say it's a pretty mediocre book. It didn't real pull me in, and it didn't draw any emotions from me. I also felt no connection to the charecters. I wouldn't recommend this to friend."
1,"The cover is very well done, but...","This is not a 5 star book. I'm rating it as one star to off set these token 5 star reviews. I think the book is taking advantage of the horrible situation just to make an extra buck..This book is nothing profound. Just another extrapolation on the atrocities of man. When you see the book, it does look very nice, short and sweet, with a fanciful cover and a fanciful name. I would also decribe the story as fanciful, too; something contrived to make use of the Holocost. It's like a bad Titanic novel spin off. Not as bad though. It was laborious getting through the book, but luckily due to it's fanciful lengh (200+ pages), it was over soon. Add to that a few fanciful touches of political correctness and you get a nice, fanciful take on the Holocost. However, considering that it was published by TOR Fantasy, that is what we all should expect. A fantasy that is."
1,Inappropriate for Young Adults,"The book make have may merits where insight about the Holocaust is concerned ...[But he planned to have a long talk with his lover about being more gentle the one morning.] But when he woke, he found the man dead in the marble bath...""This is hardly appropriate for 9-12 year olds."
1,terrible!,"I felt this was a watered down version of what could have been a good book. I also strongly feel it is unsuitable for anyone under age to read this. There is mention of foreplay, homosexual acts leaving one man sore and a suicide in a bathtub. Not for children!"
3,a Mom's opinion,"""They made love during Hitler's victory speech, a horrible, angry, passionate thrusting, that left Josef bruised and somewhat stunned. He had planned to have a long talk with his lover about being more gentle the next morning. But when he woke, he found the man dead in the marble bath, his wrists still bleeding soft red lines into the tub.""This passage is taken directly from the book. While the passage is certainly out of context, I found it disturbing that my 11 year old checked this book out of her school library. Today's children are exposed to so much more than I was when I was growing up, and not all of it is age appropriate. I've not read the whole book, so it may be a good story, but be aware of passages such as this that are too mature for many children."
2,History in a fairy tale....,"Not a book for children. Some may disagree but it is my opinion. There are too many adult situations for a younger audience. That said, Miss Yolen brings an intriguing story to paper that comes to a complete ending. I like the way she pulls the story together chapter by chapter, never giving any thing away until necessary."
5,Briar Rose - One of my all-time favorite books!,"The first time I read this book I couldn't put it down! It pulled me in with Ms. Yolen's usual attention to character and background and I became so emotionally involved with the characters and the story that I had to finish it. Since then I have reread it many times and every time it evokes the same emotions. I have read at least 1500 books so far in my life, and I would rate this one in the top five. I am a big Jane Yolen fan. I have talked about Briar Rose to many people and have even had to replace my copy when someone didn't return it. I highly recommend it!"
4,"A very good,heart-felt,mystery,but somewhat confusing.","The present in the story and the flashbacks were very well written, but it was somewhat hard to understand how they both blended in together. The clues to finding how they blended together,were very hard to find. Everything else was very good though. It shows the reader that when you want to find anything, even if it's almost impossible to find,you'll find it if you don't lose hope and faith, and give-up."
4,The book was a great mystery of a holocaust survivor.,Briar Rose was a intresting story of a young woman who is trying to find out about her grandma's past. The first part of the story is a bit boring. Most readers will get confused with the flashbacks and real life of the story. It only adds up to the mystery of the story and comes together at the very end. Even though the book is fiction it does give some intresting facts about the holocaust that you probobly didn't know.
4,heartwarming tale about the healing power of love,"Madeline has been badly wounded by her upbringing and finds it impossible to trust men. Running away from her uncle, who plans to practically sell her to pay off his debts, she bumps into Philip, the Earl of Pemberton. He's in need of a wife and as he's going to Yorkshire to live on his estate it gives Madeline the perfect escape from her uncle. The marriage is only for six months so that he can claim his inheritance - not a new ploy in a Regency romance, but one which works well here - and over the six months Madeline has a chance to come to know and trust him. A real feel good book."
3,Sweet romance book.,"I liked it. It was a sweet book. It is a clean story with a few kisses until the end and even then they skip over the sex scene. Still it was well written, with good characters."
3,WARNING...,"Warning!!! While the songs on this CD are good, for some reason neither the theme song nor any of Priss's other vocals are on the disk, in fact the entire CD is insrumental."
3,"Raft, Bogart, Holden, so you cannot go wrong ?","This 1939 ""Gangster/crime movie was the typical run of the mill stories they were put out during the 1930s, but is very enjoyable especially with seeing Bogie in one of his early roles as a thug, but with a good heart.Raft is as wooden as ever and a young William Holden over acts every time he loses his temper. The story line is typical of bad guy trying to go good, but society prevents his reform !It is amazing that in a short 10 years that Bogart would be a Mega Superstar, Holden would be a superstar and Raft would be...well...he would have an ""Invisible Career"" !!"
4,As good as it gets !,"If your not really ""into"" Japanese swordsmanship this video will be tedious to watch. It is very informative and technically precise... but the camera work REALLY stinks. And some of the material covered gets very repetitive. But, as compared to the other material available... this is about as good as it gets."
4,a great dog collar!,"This dog collar was very nice. I do wish it had been a little wider since the dog it was going on is rather large. However, on the website it did tell the width of the collar, so I guess that's my fault. It's hard to find a Miami Dolphins dog collar in Virginia so I was just glad to find this one for my son's dog."
2,Just not right for me,"I needed something that would allow me to also carry my wallet and other things due to a temporary limitation on movement. This did not have that capability. It is also quite tall - in order to sit down without having it pushed down into my lap, I'd have to wear it well above my waist.There was no issue with the company from whom I bought it - they shipped efficiently. The manufacturer's pictures just don't show that the front storage are is extremely small."
3,"As described, but abnormally large","I am 5'4"", and just did not realize just how large this bag would be. I ordered the large, based on the weapon I carry. Although, in addition to my weapon, I was able to carry a pair of handcuffs, extra mag, badge and other small incidentals; including my wallet, it was so huge once I had it on, it got in the way of sitting at a table, sitting in the driver's seat of my car; putting on a seatbelt and actually as the day wore on, made my hip hurt.If you are a fairly large person, it may not be so wickedly large on you; but if you are short - don't bother.It is well constructed and it is a shame I cannot use it. Truly wish that I could."
4,My mother likes,I baught this book as a gift for my mother. She uses it everyday and loves it. It is well used and looks it.
2,Look elsewhere for a thrill.,"I generally like the music of Terry Riley and his Salomne Dances by the Kronos Quartet are especially worth a listen. But the innovative sounds for which he is known are missing in this composition. The Joan Tower composition, Snow Dreams, is the only piece that saves this bland recording. Snow Dreams is also on the recording ""Black Topaz"" along with other wonderful music. Do yourself a favor and go to the Naxos website to hear a sample before buying."
5,An Enjoyable Textbook!,"For those of you who are education majors dreading having to read yet another book on educational theory, dread it no more! I think this was the most enjoyable textbook I read while in college. It offers practical cases in which the ideal and less than ideal way of doing things is illustrated, which I found very helpful. Some of the advice might be a bit idealistic, but overall I felt that it offered good ideas. It's also entertaining to see how many interesting names the author uses for students and teachers.:) He does a good job at being culturally sensitive!"
5,Like the Bible for new teachers,I constantly referenced this book as a new teacher. I have since passed it on to my sister who became a certified teacher.
1,Avoid the Blue Hands,"My friend and I bought the one set of red servers and one set of blue.Then we exchanged one from each set so that we each had one red hand and one blue hand.I used my salad servers only once and 4 of the fingers shredded and fell off the blue hand. The red hand was fine.I called my friend and she had the same experience, now we just have to get the two red hands together!"
3,Fun to use with large salad bowl,"I purchased green Tossers at MOMA shop several years ago, using them with a very large red salad bowl 2 to 3 times a year. They are large (over 13 inches long and 3+ inches at the 'palm'; they have a nice smooth feel, are festive and generate conversation by the users. The green ones get 5 stars for looks and feel, but only 2-3 for durability- 2 fingers broke off one of the tossers. I had only used them perhaps a dozen times. BUT I do like them and will repurchase. Hope I can find green ones. or will settle for the blue. Somehow I think the clear ones will not convey the same impression of fun and festivity which is why I purchased green ones originally."
2,disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this product. The ornament was dated 2007, and that wasn't advertised. I felt like I was paying for a re-gifted itemI returned the item before xmas, using the return address on the box, which wound up being the wrong address, and had to pay an $8 to ups to have the package re-directed.Still don't have my credit...big disappointment all the way around."
3,Young scientist & the programmable calculator,The problems are interresting. But I didnt like the fluxograms and the programs. The fluxograms are up to date and the programs are for the TI-59. I prefer algorithms insted of fluxograms and programs.
4,Schecter RIOT 5 is a winner!,"This bass is a definite keeper! The looks are great with the burled maple top and the way the body is carved. It also has a great feel due to the matte satin finish which makes the neck play like a dream! The looks are enhanced by the smoky gray hardware.The only thing that stops me from giving this bass 5 stars is its sound. Not that the bass sounds bad, its just that the preamp doesnt add quite enough volume. Obviously you can fix this on the amp but I just found the volume to lag a little behind my other basses."
3,Semi useful Item - Great for Fishpoles,"For use on fish pole storage, these work very well. They do not grip nearly strong enough for most other uses. They do hold a screw driver...but are overkill for that purpose...too big and expensive.Even when used for fish poles, you need a hook on the top part of the rod, to hold it into the holder, or it will not hold anything very well."
5,Great for toddlers,"My granddaughter watched her first timmy time so much it was driving the rest of us crazy so we bought several more timmy times to give the rest of us a break. the little ones really love timmy, great for 3-4 year olds"
3,John Beltran - Sun Gypsy,"John Beltran delivers more Latin jazz-infused house with SUN GYPSY. ""Kiana"" has a sunny, romantic haze, while ""Felicidad Nova"" is a foot-tapping fiesta, complete with guitar, that switches gears halfway through. ""La Nueva"" is a little self-indulgent, however, and the cover of Sting's ""Fragile"" seems unnecessary, but ""Dashiki"" thankfully shakes things up by bringing in some speedy breaks. ""Heaven and Earth"" closes the album on a more downtempo note, still plenty tropical and no less funky. It's certainly a competent album, though not one that's particularly noteworthy."
2,try and try again,"For me this is the weakest of Beltrans albums. I enjoy all of his music and own all of his works to date (including Placid Angels and Indio)- but this collection seems generic and stale. The Latin element is hardly unique. The electronic stylings are transparent, which for me is a let down. The standout track is a remake of ""Fragile"" by Sting. I must say that the song has never sounded better."
4,"A great ""little"" dictionary!","Obviously, a miniature didctionary like this one can't include the amount of information found in a home reference-type dictionary, but for a small travel dictionary, or one for a beginning student of Italian, this one is really good. I used it for a two-week, intensive language course in Rome and every word I needed for class I found in this dictionary. It's also very compact and will fit in a pocket, purse, or fanny-pack. If you want something a little more complete, yet still paperback book-size, I recommend the Bantam New College dictionary. Now, does anyone have a recommendation for a complete, home-reference dictionary???"
4,Horror on the Hill: A forgotten classic?,"This module was from the early days of D&D. It has a small village, which could be a good base of operations. Across the river, a ruined monastery beckons. Inside there are skeletons, goblins, kobolds and a dragon. I've used parts of this adventure so many times and it was always a great time. Highly recommended!"
5,Great module for 2nd-3rd level players!,"This is an excellent module. Perfect for a party just getting used to the D&D world. Probably a bit too hard for 1st level players unless the party is large, and even then expect a few casualties. I played it with a party of 5 3rd level players and my PC's loved it. A good 'wilderness' section without being too large for the party to get lost and thus lose interest, and an excellent dungeon crawl section with lots of hobgoblins to bash. My only criticism is the juvenile Red dragon at the end is too easy to kill at 22 odd HP. To my chagrin, the thief PC was able to sneak up and kill it outright without a breath of flame to be unleashed on the party! An excellent module. Classic!"
1,not a great book - not sure why it got good reviews by others,"I have purchased other amphibian books that have far more pictures and maps. This has no maps of the area, so one would expect that all amphibians and reptiles in the book are found everywhere in the area. I know that is not true from other reptile books. ""A Field Guide to the Amphibians and Reptiles of the Maya World: The Lowlands of Mexico, Northern Guatemala, and Belize"" by Julian C. Lee is far superior and we've been able to identify every species we have seen. The maps are better in Lee's book and the images are larger and more clear. I can't see why this book recieved 4.5 starts as it is basically useless for identification."
5,Sebald in Italy and the Alps,"Although it as only now come out in English, ""Vertigo"" preceded ""The Emigrants"" and ""Rings of Saturn"", and was the first book in which Sebald developed his unique prose style. There are four sections of varying length. The first is devoted to the French writer Stendhal crossing the Alps with Napoleon; the following one shows us the familiar Sebald persona in Italy; the third is about Kafka's trip to the same country; the last and most moving one has the narrator return to his native Bavaria. To those who know Sebald, no more needs to be said. To the others, one might try to give an idea by saying that Sebald's style could perhaps be explained as a kind of civilized interior monologue; it always implies the awareness that writing cannot imitate the way we really think, yet it uses the associations that come to the narrator's mind to make the texutre of the narrative immensely satisfying and touching."
5,Accessible - even though I had never heard of Sebald,"I was wondering around the bookstore when I saw the cover. I open the book up and paged through it. Illustrations, drawings and maps and photos, on every page! Text written directly to the images! I purchased the book. I can't imagine a better decision.Vertigo unfolds like a dream, unreal and hyper-real at the same time. A string of unrelated stories, a chapter each. Different characters, different centuries, yet underneath it all a use of language as music no less gifted than Mozart's. Moods, spells, memories, rapture -- all suspended from reality to take on their own existence. A masterwork, wonderously accessible, a book you will read more than once."
4,"a somber, luminous rumination","What a dark, brooding book this is. Sebald weaves together these luminous strands of personal memory and broader history and creates a sort of pastiche of resonances between them. You sort of float through his delightful reconstructions of episodes in the lives of Stendhal and Kafka, and then you notice how European history in general, both the parts that he explores and the ones that, in not outright exploring, he alludes to, bleed into the present and into his own past. I guess it's a book about remembering, and half-remembering, and forgetting. And it's also about the disorientation and diffusion between those. It definitely gave me Vertigo."
2,Read Sebald but skip this one!,"I read this right after a great time reading RINGS OF SATURN. Before that I got AUSTERLITZ from the library and loved it.So this one was a major disappointment coming after his other two.The only thing that saved it from an F or D grade(one star) was his chapter at the beginning on Stendahl(spelling?) who was really named something like Byre...French, experiences with women and Napoleon. I had read THE RED AND THE BLACK(Al Gore's favorite book)and found that book interesting but not enjoyable.Anyway,VERTIGO just never got through to me after the first chapter. Some descriptions of Venice, Italy, were good but mostly the author noodled about in trains and vaguely reacted to his own inner states of memory and feeling in a whiney, underwhelming way. I hope EMIGRANTS is better."
1,dissapointed,"Sorry,I found the writing style (or translation) migrane causing. I was lured in by all the positive reviews, but found the reading of the book to be more like a chore. I'd get this from the library before I spent money on it."
1,depths of vertigo,"insufferably dull and pointlessly preponderous. How can someone take something which could be so interesting and batter it over the head with miserable inadequacy. What a witless man with his ""bad associations"" with everywhere and everything."
4,A nice departure from the Spenser series.,"Being a long time fan of the Spenser novels, I was going into the book with a prejudice against liking it. After I sorted out the initial characters I was hooked. I did not want the book to end. Anyone familiar with the Spenser novels will be right at home with the writing style and flow of the book. I especially liked the way he blended the past storytelling with the current day dialoge. A very nice read."
2,Parker out of his league,"I give Robert Parker credit for being amibitious enough to try something new, something more profoud than his genre novels. But this novel simply does not live up to the challenge. The central romantic relationship is rendered as if this were a Harlequin romance -- corny, to say the least. And the plot, after a credible opening set in 1920's Ireland, degenerates into cliche after cliche. The characters are never believable. Sorry to say, the book is not very compelling or interesting."
3,Not Spenser-quality,"Being a big fan of Spenser, I bought this in hardback without looking at the dustcover. Imagine my suprise when I started reading about Ireland's IRA. If the book had started and ended with Conn, Parker could have had a really good book. He just over-extended himself with 3 generations. I finished it, but I didn't enjoy the book once it left Ireland. I kept expecting it to improve-after all, it was a Parker novel. Not one I would recommend to anyone. I didn't even keep my copy, but sold it to a resale shop. I would have sworn someone else had written it and just put Robert B. Parker's name on it. Not on quality-par with Spenser novels or with Perchance to Dream or Poodle Springs"
5,An American Classic,"With the vigor of a Spenser novel, this is one of Parker's best, a literary work, and a long read. It is a penetrating look at the dark side of the american urban scene. While a bit slow at first, your patience is well worthwhile. This book covers three generations, and I think it is comparable to Evelyn Waugh's BRIDESHEAD REVISITED. Thank you Robert Parker."
3,Not a bad CD for the price you pay.,"This CD is not a bad deal for the price you pay, however, if it were any more expensive it would be a horrible deal. The CD is good but it's not the type of CD that you listen to and it makes you want to go out a buy every Beatles CD ever made, but it is something that is quite enjoyable and is definitely worth the money you spend on it."
3,Love the watch - hate the wristband,"The watch is everything I had hoped for in an inexpensive casual package, but I hate the wrist band - I just don't know how anyone could think it is comfortable! I'll probably be looking for a new wrist band to fit."
3,work watch,"I like the face display, very clear. I don't like the watch band.The watch tends to rotate on your wrist if band is not tight.If I tighten the band it's very uncomfortable.I will have to buy a new band for it ( velcro type) which as some of you know, are expensive."
5,satisfied,This is the second time I have purchased this model watch. The first got moisture in it after I changed the battery. This has a very easy to read the face and both analog and digital watches in one. It's very handy for lots of things.
2,"no countdown timer, awkward button placement","The pros, everyone has already said enough. It's a good analog-digital combination watch. Easy to read, easy to set.Big con for me: I didn't know this didn't have a countdown timer. What multi-function digital watch doesn't have a countdown timer? It's what I use frequently to see when I need to go back to put quarters in the meter, to take a 15 minute nap, or to check on the roast.Con: button placement is awkward. For a right hander, the upper right button should be where your index finger naturally falls, when you have your thumb resting on the lower left button for switching modes.However, upper right button is just a cosmetic protrusion for aesthetics, and you're supposed to use the bottom right with your index finger for most ""setting"" functions. It's uncomfortable, it's awkward. Casio's industrial designers seemingly didn't test this one out more with foam mockups."
4,good one,"Pros - Pretty Good, like the features and stylecons - The buttons are hard, the Indiglo feature works only on Date mode, does not work when its on stopwatch mode etc - this is extremely annoying esp. in the middle of the night when you want to know the time.."
5,Watch is underated,This watch is the best underated thing that i have ever purchased that i actually purchased two of them at once just in case they stop making it. Perfect for someone who uses military time daily and needs an analog reference as well. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
1,Casio Mens watch,"i liked the reviews and pics but when I got the watch I was disappointed. The face was small like a womans or kids watch, not what I wanted so I sent it back."
1,shower water got in after 3 months,"soooo, i send it in for warranty repair at my cost...they will fix it but there is $10 shipping and handling charge. So, should i pay $15 to repair a $30 watch that is under warranty, or just buy a different watch? I am disappointed, the warranty is worthless."
4,Nice casual watch,Like the analog and digital displays together. Easy to read analog face but digital displays are a little too recessed.
4,Effective watch,"I bought the watch for the month, day and year plus dual time. I will leave the digital time for home and the analog for a different time zone. I replaced the funky watch band with a nice black expansion band. The light is bright."
3,Not so much,"Disturbia gone bad. Considering who was in it, I thought it'd be better. I was wanting my 1.5 hours back."
3,I expected better,It was not a bad movie but not a movie I would want to watch more the once. Most of the scenes were predictable because the trailer gives it away.
4,Grave errors,"Don't upset the works as there might be trouble and he won't like it. Perfect place for the chills and thrills in this horror, Dennis Quaid plays a fantastic role and the others couldn't be more suitable. It's all there the settings of graves and the coolness of the night with plenty of suspense and errie silence, that keeps you clinging to the chair or who ever is closest. I do recommend this movie to see or buy, something there that keeps you wondering what is next with a twist. A marvellous dvd for most who like these types of shows, than later on have the after affect of nightmares, the expressions on hes face are enough to say, you ask for it. A must for the brave heros and great show to watch I gave it A plus for entertainment and being original down right to the last. Don't forget to turn the lights off its better that way."
4,You gotta see it for Dennis Quaid!,"So it may not be the greatest movie in the world, but Dennis Quaid's performance is a must-see! For one thing, the idea of him playing a villain is strangely entertaining to begin with, but he does it in a way that's off the charts humorous and interesting. Right from the crazy first to the crazy last scene, I thoroughly enjoyed that part of the movie!"
4,Good movie. Better than I expected.,Dennis Quaid as a psycho funeral home owner. Weird that he was a killer and did the funeral of his victims! Three friends trying to prove he killed their friend. The vision of people dancing in front of their window freaks me out now. Suspense and drama. Really liked this film. Great date night movie.
3,I was really rooting for Quaid,"I would have given this movie 5 stars if Quaids character would have survived. None of the introduced characters that were ""victimized"" were deserving of any sympathy. Stick your nose in someone elses business and you deserve to get it bitten off so to speak.Quaid is doing quite well as an actor as he ages. I have always been a fan of both him and his currently troubled brother. Dennis has provided me with a lot of entertainment over the years and I owe him at least a hearty thank you......so if you are reading this Mr. Quaid, I appreciate everything you have provided me with in the form of entertainment."
4,Better than standard horror-thrillers,"With the casting and the creepy story, this film stands out as being better than the average horror or thriller flick. A mortician is obsessed with his late wife, and a group of teens stumble onto his dark secrets. I will not give away any more."
2,I'LL LEAVE THE LIGHT ON FOR YA,"My biggest disappointment is that the by-line reveals too much about the film. I will assume you have read it. The opening scene of Quaid burying alive his wife's lover was decent. It moves to a classroom scene where the discussion is about both Poe and Macbeth...nice tie-in.Travis (Tony Oller) plays the moody teen lead who laments over his dead sister, and sometimes sees ghosts which he confides in cheerleader Abby (Aimee Teegarden). One night some of the teens, thinking Quaid isn't home, enter his mortician residence ghost hunting, only to find he is at home and has an unhealthy relationship with his dead, embalmed, not exactly buried wife.The movie starts out like it is going to be a barn burner, then it slows and dies.Parental Guides: infrequent F-bomb, no sex or nudity."
2,What is it that kids say these days? Meh? That's this movie.,"Always have been a fan of Dennis Quaid - Dreamscapes, InnerSpace, Enemy Mine, etc. - so I was really looking forward to seeing what he has been up to recently. Unfortunately, he put himself into one of these ""teen horror"" movies which doesn't bode well. He does give a good performance, and through the movie I was actually rooting for him to be the ""winner"" at the end, just because these teen movies are becoming more and more horrible in way of the acting of the kids in the movies.Dennis Quaid's acting was pretty good... the rest of the actors seemed to have phoned it in. Recommendation? Wait until it hits the .99 cent queue, or better yet, wait until it goes to the Prime queue. Just don't sign up for Prime to just watch this... it's not worth it."
2,Beneath The Darkness,"This is the worst horror movie of 2012 that I have seen yet.Boring,bad acting,not very likeable characters,bad script,I didn't like Dennis Quid in this at all.I'm glad I got this movie from my local library and didn't pay any money to see it.I wish I would've picked a different movie instead."
1,Really Dennis?,OK so I realize it was not DeNiro but even for Dennis Quaid....REALLY? All time low. You probably should have taken a soap opera gig instead. YIKES
4,Put them in a bus,"Overhead replacement speakers in a school bus. Sound good. Doin' the job. Bright, well made, easy to install. Used a head with a crossover, so the sub removed low end duty from these."
1,Caution you may not get all accessories.,"I recieved Makita KIT2, WITHOUT edge guide, or the dust collector attachment. It seems this may be standard fare for KIT2. But this is NOT what Grizzly says is in the KIT they were offering. Although they advertise that these are 'in the box' they were not. They do not sell the edge guide or dust collector and can not send them out. I was also missing the hex key but that is probably minor. I never used this item. I countered to Grizzly for a merchandise or cash credit for the missing items to be competitive with others that sell the stipped down kit, but the only recourse they offered was to ship this thing back. The Amazon offering for the router without accessories was for less money and free shipping. I ordered from Grizzly because I expected the full package, but that is not what I got. The offering from Grizzly is no bargain. Make another selection."
3,A classic 6 star album marred by wrong-headed remastering.,"Field Day is the masterwork of one of the greatest singer/songwriter/guitarists of the past 20 years. Crenshaw reached his compositional peak on this record and his yearning pop-style vocals are double-tracked and futzed with by producer Steve Lillwhite to give an edgy twist to Phil Spector's wall of sound. Everybody who likes pop music should own a copy. Trouble is, the boomy original production, which played Crenshaw's chiming guitar riffs off of the over-echoed drum mix has been digi-fied in this reissue. The drums now sound crisp and over-present, and just about bury every other bit of sound. If you can find this in vinyl and still own a turntable, get it. Otherwise, I guess you gotta settle. Oh, yeah, and the label who did this to Crensh also let two of his albums go out of print, one of which, ""Downtown"", is almost as essential. <sigh>"
5,Classic Guitar Pop in Cinerama,"This album reminds me of a red-hot prom band recording its' repertoire in the empty gym after all the kids have gone. It has the sort of atmosphere that conjures up visions of the 'TV' sixties eg no Vietnam, race riots etc, just happy times cruisin' in the GTO. And why 'Whenever You're On My Mind' wasn't no. 1 for several months I'll never know...still, we love it !"
5,GREAT CD'S,"These Memorex CD's are extremely reliable and I have bought many spindles to keep my supply up. They almost all burn perfectly, although I've had an error or two so far. If you want a[n inexpensive] way to backup and distribute data, these disks are great!"
2,Not good with my burner and software!,Don't know why but it seems the CDRs with up to 16x compatibility don't work with my Gateway burner and Adaptec CD Creator. Tried TDK (up to 12x compatibile) and didn't have one bad. Also tried Prime and none worked.
3,Good Low Budget Effort,"The title is certainly misleading, but it should not dissuade one from giving it a try, as it is not a bad film for its genre. The film effectively avoids over-the-top anti-Nazi propganda in favor of a more low-keyed appoach. Like other films of its kind, it is particularly interesting to see how the anti-Nazi propaganda subject matter is handled in light of the year it was made, 1944, i.e., before the war was over. Some of the production values, especially the outstanding balck-and-white cinematography, are suprisingly good for a low budget film."
2,Bamboo party lights,"In the picture of the lights, the shade is given as being six inches long and four inches wide, but no mention is made of the fact the lights inside are tiny. It was also not such a party trying to put these lights together. One of our shades was defective, it took my husband a while to carve a slot into the defective shade. It is also hard to screw the bulbs into the sockets. Not what I expected at all."
3,Eh not that great.,This is a hands free headset/headphones for most sony ericsson phones. I used this with my w810. I got these headphones so that I could run and listen to music without having to worry about the headphones falling out of my ears. Unfortunetly for me these do not accomplish that task. They dont fit around my ears well and they are kind of big and clunky. Plus they do not fit into my ears as well as the headphones that come with the w810. In terms of quality though these are fine. They are sturdy and my music sounds good coming out of them.
5,Does what it's supposed to.,"It's round and full of diamonds. Other than that, it works just fine but use water to prolong it's life."
3,LPIC Certification,"The book focuses on Red Hat, RPM, VI, and the command line to the exclusion of the more recent utilities, changes, and tools (such as DHCP) which are now the mainstay of the Linux Administrator. If it helps cram for the LPIC I wouldn't take it -- not only because it would be unnecessarily difficult, but also because it is useless. It would be like taking a trivia test for Linux instead of learning how to become a competent administrator."
2,No simulation on the cd!?,"I tried to install the simulator under Ubuntu Linux 5.10. The installation works fine, but when I run examsim I get a gtk windows telling me:There are no exams in /usr/local/lib/examsim/examsThe simulation will not work!Check your installation.I cannot understand where the problem is, since /usr/local/lib/examsim/exams/LPI101 and LPI102 are there and full of files!The book looks good, although I still haven't read it. But I must say that I bought it mostly for the simulator, so I'm a little disappointed...Mr. Brunson: I wasn't able to contact you directly, so will you please answer me here? Thank you."
5,Very Satisfied,"First time I purchased anything featuring this group. I wasn't disappointed, liked the entire CD. Check it out, you'll be glad you did."
2,Slumber : Boring Diatribe of a Niche Pundit,"Personally I would recommend a more engaging piece of fiction, such as ... oh, say Moby Dick. If you do, though, please remember to support your local library (our new governor forgot about those)."
5,"Watch out ....""liberal media""!","There's always a lot of fretting and steaming from the ""right wing"" about the oh so powerful and left leaning media. This book documents it and puts it all down in black and white. A real eye opener! I highly recommend it for open minded people, only.Get a real ""education"" and read this book."
2,At least it makes a good doorstop...,"I'm a moderate, and not a big fan of mainstream media. So I was hoping to learn something from this book, or at the very least, pass a few enjoyable hours.Neither hope came to fruition. The author's writing style is deadly boring, and it was filled with the same old tired yelling about the ""liberal media"" without even a single new slant on the subject to alleviate the monotony."
4,You go get'em Ann,"It's nice to see some one stand up and say what most americans think. I like the fact that she is not ""political"" in her criticism. She calls it liks she see it."
5,It's about time!!,"What a wonderful, insightful, and long overdue read! Ann Coulter is not only brilliant, but incredibly humorous. She makes a legitimate case against the childish behavior and name calling by liberals and the liberal media overall. Two reviews (A reader from Mountain View, CA and Mare from Allentown, PA) certainly make the point for Ms Coulter. Their vindictiveness is pitiful. Rational argument is apparently an unacceptable form of debate for many liberals. I'm buying a couple more copies to send to friends who need to be enlightened. Bravo Ann!"
1,The media is right,"Ann Coulter persuasively demonstrates that the mainstream media is well to the left of George W. Bush (Thank God), and that conservatives as a group have no sense of humour. Not news. The book is filled out with virulent rhetoric attacking anyone to the left of Genghis Khan. Nowhere does it attempt to defend Bush's indefensibly atrocious domestic and international policy that is making a laughingstock of the world's most powerful (and dangerous) country.A complete waste of time."
1,...from a republican,"Probably one of the sloppiest and most unintelligent books I have ever read...if you're looking for a laugh (not with her but at her), then pick this one up. This book was enough to make me ashamed of my own party."
2,No Surprises,"This is a typical book of its sort...in other words, if you're a conservative reading it, you'll love it. If you're a liberal reading it, you'll hate it. Ms. Coulter decides to eschew any sort of reasonable even-handedness, and resorts to right-wing demagoguery throughout the book. It reads like a slightly less dopey version of Rush Limbaugh, and makes you wonder if anyone is interested in examining both sides of an issue anymore. Oh, wait, the liberal side is argued EVERYWHERE ELSE, so we need books like these. Sorry. Forgot."
5,A bold and honest writer not intimidated by those who don't like her,"I like this book and wish many more people would take time to read it. Ms Coulter does not spin but backs up everything she claims with detailed facts.If you disagree, borrow it from interlibrary loan from local library and just read the book"
1,It's not good enough to serve as a coaster,"""The real value of Slander . . . is not in the jokes or devastating exposés of liberal politicians and their allies, but the serious and scholarly study of just how entrenched the media prejudice is against anyone whose politics are even faintly conservative.""-New York SunThe above quote has to be a joke. It has to be, because it's absolutely a lie. So is most of the book. I didn't see one single fact in this book. It was all lies. Ann Coulter is a liar, and judging from this book, may well be mentally ill. She manipulates her audience and obviously thinks her readers are stupid. The ""facts"" she uses are misquotes at the very least. Her ""research"" is lazy, if you want to be kind, or downright malicious if you want to be honest. I will never read another word she says. It's frightening that anyone would read what she has to say and believe it."
5,Funny and aware..Ann is great!,"Ann Coulter takes no prisoners, and this book is evidence of that.At times hilariously funny, and eminently readable, this book is a fascinating piece if journalism. As an attorney, she knows the value of a footnote, and there are pages and pages of them. Her lightning-fast and knife-edge sharp arguments are incredibly well thought out, and even when you don't agree with her you have to admit she's made a good argument.Don't miss this one if you have any interest in politics or society today."
5,Ann is right,"If you are a liberal read this book and prepare to be angry! Just read the reviews by liberals above who resort to the same time of name calling described in this book. Ms. Coulter painstakingly documents every one of her points and her publishing company even required her to cut some of her footnotes! She has been attacked and fired for her position, but the American people must agree with her because her book immediately shot to the number one position on the New York Times Best Seller List. This book was an amazing read, full of details that every American, especially well-informed conservatives should know!"
3,This book only makes the problem worse.,"I have seen or heard Ann Coulter interviewed many times, and I picked up this book in hopes of reading a lot more of her wit and her straight forward style.This book has neither her humour or straight forward style. This book is more of an ""In your face"" style.It's true that she has 36 pages of footnotes to doccument her quotes and comments.However; this books ""in your face"" style will be enjoyed by conservatives, but any open minded liberal will become quickly offended and put the book down in disgust and believe the book is more hate mongering by Republicans.In my opinion she should have offered her book AFTER removing MANY of the phrases that cause knee jerk reactions with liberals.Unfortunately; this book sheds more heat than light. Two Bears."
1,A complete was of time and money,... Miss Coulter's arguements number one don't add up and number two turn into rants of anti-liberal propaganda. In giving many examples she forgets to show the Republican side that is sometime just as bad as Democrats. While neither side of the political parties is right or wrong her agruements that Democrats are always wrong are just plain nuts....
1,Those nasty liberals...,"...first they had the nerve to drag us out of the Great Depression. Then they pulled us through WWII and out of Viet Nam. That perverted SOB Clinton cleaned up the economic mess that Reagan and Bush I left behind just in time for Bush II to do it all over again...and we're so glad W ignored all those damn chickens that squawked about the sky falling before 9/11/01.I can seriously say that I find the scholarly works of Lee and Kirby, circa 1965, far more believable than the anecdotal ramblings of Ms. Coulter. What a long way we have come since then, when people like her would have been routinely committed to the nearest psychiatric facility!"
1,Spare us,"Hey lady, instead of wasting your time attacking Liberals, (because that's all you seem to know how to do) why don't you tell me something good that you so called ""conservatives"" are doing for our country."
1,Who's being the hater based on thoughts now,"Coulter criticizes liberals for hating america, and for being based on lies -- but that seems to be all this book is about. Talk about exploiting the facts and making up some to show hatered again a large part of America. And who hates America -- those who fight for the benefit of it's people and the rights intrisic to that (aka liberals) or those warmongerers who just want to kill anyone who looks or thinks differently than they do(Ann Coulter). I happen to be extremely offended by this book based on the fact that it was full of lies -- and no, liberals don't hate america, they don't hate conservatives, they just happen to voice their opinion on policies that they oppose. But according to Ann Coulter the correct thing to do is shut up and go along with whatever the government says. Blind Patriots. Talk about Nazi-ism!"
5,A Good Read,"My advice, read the book.Then read all the one star reviews.""Quod Erat Demonstratum"" comes to mind.:)John"
1,Insipid Hogwash,"Worse than a female Rush Limbaugh, more vicious than a cornered rat, not powerful at all, Ms. Coulter seems to be little more than a bandwagon jumper who will find shortly that the bandwagon now is horseless. The premise of the book got my attention and got me to read it. However, lest there be any confusion, the title of the book is not reflective of the contents which are little more than the collective ramblings of a pre-modern maniac depressive. There is some clarity to her thought process in stark contrast to the drug induced largely incoherent ramblings of Mt. Limbaugh. Bottom line - read the book if you want to try to comprehend the otherise incomprehenisble but try to borrow it so Ms. Coulter is not financially rewarded for her bigotry."
2,Biased? I think so,"Let me flat out say that I am a liberal and a Democrat. I decided to read this book to learn about the conservative side of the story. From page one, I lost my temper. Everything she said stretched the truth and used illogical statements to get to the conclusion that it is the liberals fault for everything wrong in America. This is the same lady who said that liberals are the only ones to call other people names and be negative. This is the same lady who defends George W. Bush's intelligence. For any conservative, go ahead and read this slander (because that is what the book is) because you will enjoy it. Any liberal who wishes to learn a true represenation of the right wing would want to try another book. I suggest ""Bias"" by Bernard Goldberg, which though is biased as well, does a much better job than Ann Coulter."
1,Poor Fact Checking,"This book certainly has an emotional appeal. By comparing people with liberal ideology to terrorists Ann appeals to her base of support. It is full of inflammatory remarks that might insight rage in you, if you are already very conservative.The problem is, a lot of the book isn't true. I'm not sure why she did so little fact checking, but it makes the book nothing more than a propaganda piece."
1,"Horrible, Malicious.","I've in the past donated a lot of books to the Library. However this piece of trash will get donated to the incinerator. This right wing egotist doesn't know the first thing about writing a book. The title of this book should pertain to her and only her. The reason is simple. If you ever saw her on tv or on radio talk shows being interviewed by one-sided hosts, she finds fault with then slanders everything about whatever topic discuss. Senator Joe McCarthy would loved to come up from the grave and give her a swift kick in the A$$."
5,Excellent reading,"The liberals are not going to like this exposé. But what she said is right on, it has been coming. Truly the liberals have controlled this country for the last 50 years, she is just bring out the dirty laundry that it was bound to come out eventually. She is bright, knows her subject. It is not wasting your money unless what she's got to say is bringing out a liberal biased side that you may have."
5,Most anyone who gives this less than four stars is a liberal,It's rather simple really. Ann Coulter bashes and beats and bruises anyone who is on the left wing and uses it for their own selfish agenda. Anyone who is truly believes in what their political alignment stands for should read this--it opens ones eyes further than you though possible.And the ready stock of one-liners will provide much cannon-fodder for use in political discussions.
1,The best Jingoist Nazi Blonde Bombshell rhetoric ever,"Wow. How frightening. Ann sometimes hints that it isn't necessarily liberals she hates, it's anyone who doesn't fit her description of a perfect American. The perfect American, according to Ann, is a 200+ pound salt of the earth good ol' boy with a handlebar moustache and a Nascar sticker on his pickup truck...and an unfathomable hatred of anything that isn't christian, conservative, or American.Frau Coulter also said us Canadians should be thankful the US ""allows"" us to be neighbors. And apparently the only places in Canada she cares for are provinces like Alberta which are well known for, you guessed it, xenophobic blue collar guys with handle bar moustaches and wannabe cowboys. How suprising."
1,Not Recommended!,This book reads very much like a first draft. The content does not seem to respect the intelligence of any reader. Ideas are half formed and sentences are poorly constucted. She uses mainly one source trying to make the case that McCarthyism was a good thing. In the end the argument she makes is thoroughly unconvincing. The publisher should be ashamed of allowing such poor writing on their imprint. I guess we readers have to face the ugly reality of such publications. It was not as if she had anything new to say. . .it sells copies.
5,The Truth Hurts!!,"SLANDER is long overdue! To those who don't like Coulter's book, I suggest you can't handle the truth. That the media is biased to the left is a proven fact. That FoxNews and the internet have done wonders to reveal that bias is also a proven fact. Hopefully the ruination of our country by America hating radicals is slowly fading. Wake up - America is the best. If it weren't you wouldn't be able to rant. You could live in one of the Arab nations where you would have NO freedom."
1,Ann Coulter: Nutcase,"Instead of taking the time to research FACTS about ""liberal"" lies, Coulter rants and raves like a lunatic, claiming how stupid liberals are. Her endnotes (not footnotes) are inaccurate, and if you decide to research them you will find that her claims were quoted out of context, or she was the one blatantly lying. As a rebuttal to her lies I recommend a book by Al Franken..Lies, and the liars that are telling them: A fair and balanced look at the right. To sum up Coulter in a word: Nutcase!"
1,distorted hatred,"Frasnkly, I could not finish this garbage for fear I would explode.Perhaps that's what Coulter and her friend Goldberg want us commie liberals to do? React.This book is rampant with poor research (if there is any at all) and unsubstantiated ""facts"".Has Ms. Coulter never heard of Google or Lexus? She doesn't even need to drag herself to a real library. Apparently that is of little concern to the readers who have reviewed it positively on this site. I recommend to them Al Franken's ""Lies and the Lying Liers who tell them"" Franken checks all Coulter's claims using reliable sources.You need not be a liberal to check this book out. Just someone with healthy skepticism.The most slanderous thing about this book is the author herself.It is an utter hate spewing waste of paper..This should be rated zero stars"
1,Junior,"Bummer--as a moderate, I was hoping there would be something useful or enlightened in here, but it was more name-calling than anything. For those who enjoy that sort of writing, buy the book, you'll be entertained.However, as Coulter is bemoaning the fact that political discussion has declined in this country, she takes it lower than even Carville did in his latest book (which is an accomplishment). Unfortunately, Coulter will do more to undermine her cause and beliefs through this book than she will persuade people to see her side of the story. Anybody who takes their politics seriously and genuinely wants a discussion will be disappointed."
2,4the$,"clearly coulter knows what her audience wants and is willing to give it up for them. she offers little objective reasoning for her 'thoughts' other than the number of copies of her writings she can pass off. strickly a by the numbers marketing piece, coulter can write a conservative book as well as a gardening one...."
1,A Truckload of $#!+,"The title says it all! Full of lies and misinformation. Highly recommended, though, if you're looking for a good laugh, despite the fact that the author was not trying to be funny."
1,Slander Is What This Book Is,"Ann Coulter is just being ridiculous, she used 780 ""endnotes"" to try to make people believe this. I cant believe people thought this was true, after all the lies on the right-leaning media (Fox ""Faux"", CNN and the others starting to copy, catering to the ignorant who choose not to wake up and realize how America has been duped by the government for their personal reasons. Thanks, Ms. Coulter, but I'm not eating this slander."
1,Slander,"Despite her obvious disapproval of the liberal ""slander"" of the right wing, she does nothing but slander liberals. She gives conservatives a bad name. How about a well balanced view of the media. Besides, conservatives are in control of the media, just look at the bull that FOX NEWS pumps out."
1,Coulter's Wet Dream,"A college professor is seated before a congressional committee. A hysterical congresswoman, wearing a black micromini - who was once a right wing pundit, asks, ""... are you, or were you, ever a member of the liberal Democratic party?""Have you no sense of decency, ma'am? Obviously not."
1,The truth about Ann Coulter,"Ann Coulter is actually a Democrat, working undercover to convert Republicans to Democrats through bitter and unbased comments that are totally radical. She doesn't make sense, think about it people, she is a Democrat. Why else would she make Republicans look even more foolish and close-minded than they already are?"
1,"Anything but ""fair & balanced""","This book would win the prize for ""Most One-Sidedness"". But what would you expect from a conservative extremist like Coulter? This book contains the usual ""liberals hate america"" statements. Nothing more, nothing less. She continues quoting people out of context too. I seriously recommend Al Franken's ""Liars and the lying liars who tell them"". It's both informative AND humorous. This book on the other hand, is dull, baseless and boring. Period."
1,"Daughter of Privilege, Not a Populist","What made me the angriest while reading this rant was that she was trying to make it out like she knows about the average American, and that her party represents the ideas of the average American!! Ann Coulter is a lawyer who grew up as a wealthy kid in New Canaan, Connecticut--her neighbors were multi-millionaires and celebrities. Ann knows NOTHING about the average hard-working American and her trying to identify with us was just one big JOKE! (So was this entire book by the way.) All of us average hard-working Americans need to save our money right now, not to line Ann's pockets with our hard-earned cash. Don't buy it--Ann will pop up on TV soon and you can get her ""message"" for free. No great revelations (duh, the media is biased about a million things--and they're not liberal anymore anyway. Ann's about 20 years too late), just her doing her usual shtick."
1,Doubting Katie,"I have no doubt that Ann Coulter hates the left. This isn't much a of a substantial argument against it. She makes some of the strangest claims; comparing, for example, Katie Couric with Eva Braun...."
3,"""On the fence!""","Coultier's book portrays conservatives as, no-nonsense types of politicians, while they too abuse power, as well as add considerable ""pork"" to the country. I see them as complete Nazis! They want nobody to question their authority! Meanwhile, liberals throw words at conservatives, such as, ""Homophobia/homophobic"" to put them immediately on the defensive. Such a word is very powerful and persuasive, but to nip that type of slander in the bud, I would respond with an analysis of the word ""homophobia"". It is the fear of gays/gay lifestyle, labeling conservative types with a phobia (or fear) and a pseudo-mental illness! In the meantime, gay pride parades show the freaks and geeks wearing their fruitcake clothes, leading each other around by dog leashes!!! Hmmm! I tend to be on the conservative side, yet be quite radical. This is a good book to check out, but please be objective and try to view politics from the author's point of view!"
5,Lady Ann Rocks,"Clever and extremely funny.She has well a thought out, well researched, stinging tongue.Her critiques are as expected from a top law school graduate and a keen conservative.I sure would like to see anyone try to debunk her research.PenetratingArmenianA Self Certified Blogspot Blogger"
1,good title,"The sad thing is that someone like this even gets to appear on television, not to mention gets to publish a book. It shows the sorry state of the American media that she is regularly paired up with serious commentators (from both sides of the political spectrum). But I have to admit that the title is correct - because slander is just what it is..."
2,Why should I care?,"I'm not a liberal..I'm not a conservative, I don't think it's worth paying [the price] for a book full of ""slander"" for a particular group of people. The truth is, both right and left wingers do their share of messing up the world a bit, as well as doing good things. I saw Ann Coulter on Hardball (MSNBC) and she did not even realize she was in a debate, instead ranting about how no one would pay attemtion to her beloved book. WHAT A LOSER. Any book that's sole purpose is to whine about the ""other side"" is a worthless book."
1,"Irrational, Biased and Hateful","Whatever ""facts"" Ann Coulter is able to come up with against liberals, they are quickly colored by her irrationality, bias and hate. Not a recommended read. In fact, a complete waste of my time. I am glad of one thing: I didn't spend my hard-earned money on this book."
2,Right Wing Lies About the American Center and Left,"Ann, Ann, Ann. I'll definitely have some cheese with this ""whine"".Since she got fired from the National Review the poor girl must have a little too much time on her hands. One would hope that she might focus on something important (like the fact that the stock market's in the dumps due chiefly to accounting shenanigans by her Republican friends on Wall Street) rather than churn out drivel like this. I had hoped these kind of low-rent political books would've gone out of style with the passing of the Clinton Presidency. I guess it's too much to expect the neo-cons to take the high road...David Brock was right.All is not lost, however. I'm giving it 2 stars for its entertainment value. I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. I'm also looking forward to Sean Hannity's one-dimensional take on ""what's wrong with this country"" in August"
1,Responding in kind---but overdoing it----,"Ann Coulter is the James Carville and Paul Begala of the right. Giving the Liberals back some of what they get away with daily on CNN!! They ALL do a GREAT disservice to political dialogue in this country!! Coulter's book is WAY over the top, but evidently is finding lots of fans. Sad!!!"
1,Boring conservative whining,"This is a very biased book. For example, she complains about liberal enemies being 'mocked by the liberal media' for their appearance (such as Katherine Harris, Linda Tripp). Fair enough, but doesn't she remember all the remarks about Janet Reno's looks? Even Chelsea Clinton was insulted for her looks.I have no respect for Coulter, she is an extremist. By the way, I'm a moderate but the more I hear about conservatives claiming to know 'the light' I feel more and more that conservatives are morons."
2,(Whack!) Is this horse (Whack!) really dead (Whack!) yet?,"Coulter's point, exhaustively footnoted and unimaginatively presented, is that conservatives are good and liberals are bad. What would have been more interesting as a 750-word essay was inflated into a 205-page book with 35 pages of footnotes. After 4 pages, you get the point.But her sarcastic speaking style, which plays well on CNN's Crossfire, doesn't quite make the trip in prose. Save yourself some money -- read the liner notes on Amazon.com or at your local bookstore."
5,An excellent book,"This book was the best [money] I have spent in a long time! Coulter's ""Slander"" and Goldberg's ""Bias"" is a must-read for anyone wanting to take an serious look at the leftwing bias in major media networks.It warms my heart to see that Coulter's book is now Nr. 1 in the nation. Has a leftwing columnist ever been number one? No. Leftists and liberals do not control the medium of the mind and logic.There is hope for our great Republic yet!"
1,Hypocrite,"I tried to be fair and bought this book along with one of Al Franken's. I started to try and read this one but couldn't finish after reading contradiction after contradiction.How can she say that liberals are mean and call everyone who doesn't agree with them names when she does the same thing? She also uses inaccurate generalizations. I'm not particularly political on one side or the other, but Ms. Coutler seems to fling the kind of hate she says liberals use in this hate-fest book."
5,Footnotes galore,This is an excellent book but be prepared to have your dictionary at the ready if your vocabulary is slightly lacking. Very well researched and extremely imformative. A must read.
1,I don't get it,"People rant about how funny and clever Ann is, so I decided to be fair ( and balanced) check out one of her books.She's not terribly funny ( she says things for shock value, but after awhile you get kind of numb to that and hope for actual humor, rather then name calling and wishing people dead), she does every mean evil thing she accuses liberals of doing (maybe it's meant to be irony? Is that the funny part?), the wtiting is sloppy and weak on actual facts and researchThere are lots of people out there I don't find funny and/or agree with what they say, but if they have one, I'll cut them slack for not having the other.Ann can't seem to pull off either, so I'm just left scratching my head trying to figure out what the big deal is."
2,Fighting Fire With Fire,I have enjoyed Ann Coulter as a commentator on television. For this reason I was disappointed in SLANDER. She reminded me of some of the liberal attack dogs many of us have learned to discount. The author could have done a better job of exposing the liberal media without indulging in so many of her own personal attacks.
1,Not reality based,"I read this book and it's not clear what the point of it is. It's not reality-based and I'm sorry I can't recommend it. The Constitution is what makes America great and no Ann Coulter, neither you nor your 'followers' can destroy it. If you try to destroy the Constitution, people will fight you. How do you think you can make a fascist regime or a Theocracy out of this great nation? Go to Iran or something.I'm sorry, as a true American I can't recommend this book."
5,Great book and should be read by all!!,"Next to Mike Savage's The Savage Nation and her own book, Treason, Ann Coulter's Slander is a great read. In the book, she indicates how the left is desparately trying to steal America by slandering their own country as well as those who are trying to protect it. A must read for government officials and anyone else who cares about the United States."
1,Sad,"What do pundits even exsist for? What is their purpose? How does this help anybody?All ""political"" boundries aside, this book is a pile of trash. Simple fact checking shows the numerous lies this book is built on. The real question here is, who exactly is she trying to convince? Based on the tone, it most certainly isn't ""liberals.""This book is preaching to the choir in it's worst form. Unengaging prose, nonsensical distorted ""facts,"" and an overall grating tone make this book get zero stars."
3,Has it moments,"After all the hype I just had to read this book. It does have some good moments - it's worth reading for the humor alone. However there isn't enough of that, and when Coulter gets on a rant it can go one for pages without really making a point. She is also a really weak writer and doesn't strike me as being all the bright by the way she writes. Maybe she is a better speaker but I have never had a chance to find out (I don't watch TV for the very reasons she sites in her book).Overall I would say it's worth your time, just don't get your expectations too high."
2,I thought I'd like this book better,"I found this book hard to read, as Ann Coulter is so angry that she isn't clear-sighted. Each time I read a few pages I put the book down, as her ire and hateful tone are hard to take in big doses. She makes some good points, but I can't stand the attitude."
5,Great Book,"It is very clear that those with the one sentence, one star, reviews did not read the book. I did. It is very hard to argue with the well researched facts and logic."
4,Proves her point,An excellent book and you lefties writing slimy reviews prove her point. You can't attack facts or ideas so you just sling the slime and insults and shout down and filibuster any who disagree. Shows the moral bankruptcy of the left.We need more like Ann to show the slanting of media.
2,A conservative who doesn't like the book,"For those who say this book should be ""banned"" it shows why the book should be published. It should be allowed to stand on it's own merit. To disagree with it is fine, remember part of Ann's job here was to sell books.As a conservative, you'd think I'd jump all over this book. My problem is the presentation style. Coulter jumps all over the place quickly moving from point to point. Reading the book, I felt like I was listening to a ticked off writer who needed somewhere to vent. Passion is one thing, obsession is another.Coulter could have done a much better job of discussing her points. Instead, she stoops to the same old name calling that seems to be so popular in politics now. It sure sells books, but doesn't win points from me. (And yes, the same goes for Franken)."
1,Lordy! I just figured out she's serious!,"Omigod, I've been friends with liberals for years and never knew how awful they were. Thanks so much, Ann, for the fair and balanced information. You're a real giant."
2,She tries too hard to MAKE you believe her.,"If she simply stated the facts, I'd love this woman. I'm considered to be pretty conservative in my mid-sized Okalhoma town, but I'm not going to have someone lead me to the water and then push my head in.This book is better when you take one thing into consideration; it is little more than Anne's personal opinion."
1,Horrible.,"The only way to not see all the inaccuracies in this book is to not want to see them.Coulter constantly twists the truth(and often tells flat out lies) to try and get her (flawed) point across.She gives conservatives a bad name.Read this book if you want a good laugh, but for God's sake, don't buy the thing."
5,Great typical Ann,"If you are Conservative, and want a strong dose of hard hitting analysis in your favor, or Liberal, and are not scared of reading things you disagree with, this book is for you."
2,Leave Your Brain at the Door and Call in the Hate!,"Ann is obviously dogmatic in her views. She is intent on trashing the liberal threat in every aspect of American life. However, she does this by making some unsubstantiated claims and unfortunate leaps in logic. The gaps in her book become evident in her apparent fear of liberals corrupting the country. She sees phantom liberals hiding in every corner, burning flags on every street, and plotting to resurrect Trotsky in a moments notice. She obviously feels very strongly about her view, and she brings up some good points and issues that need to be discussed, but she reaches conclusions that she doesn't support very well. If you want a book to get you fired up, read it. But it's really just the conservative ""Stupid White Men"" by Michael Moore. Both are good political candy in their own ways, but neither makes any lasting impression on the discerning reader."
1,"I'm thinking of a five letter word that starts with a ""B""","Pure drivel! Where does she come up with this stuff. After reading this book, there is no doubt in my mind that she's crazy."
1,Without 'Liberals' Anne would be nothing,"I gotta hand it to these type of political writers who make a living 'exposing' the other side of the political spectrum. Most of her insight into the Liberal agenda is her perception and interpretation of events and political ideas she does not particularly care for...SO WHAT! What makes her opinion more high-browed and expert than mine or any other ordinary person? I really don't know.If you like biased reading, then this is the book of the moment. Otherwise, if you're looking for balanced and critical analysis of political ideas (left or right) this is below the standard. Give some extra reading time to Bill Sapphire or Bill Kristol for the conservative bent, and then maybe Bill Moyers for the left."
4,"Smarts, Sass and Scrupulous Scholarship!","Required reading for any lion-hearted Aryan. From her unsubstantiated intimations of liberal conspiracies to her--and MY!--erotic fantasies of forced conversions amongst the Barbaric Horde, Coulter packs her typical punch!"
1,A Great Work of Fiction,"If this was a fiction book, I'd give it five stars, because that's all this book has, lies, right-wing propaganda, and fiction. With an absurd level of well-documented inaccuracies, lies, and venomous invective, All Ann Coulter does is expose herself as a hate-filled hypocrite. Along with her new book, ""Treason,"" Ms. Coulter sinks to a new low, and proves herself nothing more than the hate-filled creature she has always been."
3,"Extremely flawed, but a fun read","For a Log Cabin Republican, Coulter sure can spout. She is akin to a rabid dog behind a door with no ""Beware"" sign. She paints everything in black and white, them or us terms, which just isn't reality. But who cares about facts when she's preaching to a choir? Still, this book is a fun read--and I shall keep a copy next to my toilet for the next year or so."
1,Some people need to check their facts,"the ONE thing Coulter did in her life which deserves praise, it the one thing ignored in these reviews by conservatives. She WAS THE ONE WHO GOT ""Stupid White Men"" published!!! She made the call to the publisher to help Moore get the book to print. Moore's book IS researched and cited from cover to cover. Sadly, Ms. Coulter does not take the time to do the same, and her ""facts"" are more tilted that a windmill in Don Quixiote. Her prose reads more like bitter angry prose than a hard core examination of truth."
1,Mighty Mouth to the Rescue!,"Well, if there was a half of star, Ann would get it...Now that Ann is part of the Fox deal to pay a million dollars to interview the Glove Boy, let see...can she still hate movie stars and the likes? WAIT! but isnt Ann one of the bad TV movie star who makes her living being on TV? Come on people, we have seen this before with Martha Stwart, and do we still love her?Please dont get sucked in by any TV news movie stars. Democrat or Republican.Can anyone who hates movie stars soooo much continue to sit in a movie theater and not feel guilty? Or is she is just your basic hippi""crite from the big cities who writes poorly and appears to be the poster child for republican Charles Manson. I suspect Ann has never met a democrat who had a son that joined the miltary and never made it back. To bad. When she generalizes and uses ""all"" democrats or movie stars you know that its a wash. In additional, how can she support Enron and the likes?"
1,Really sad,"Just terrible, Ann only tells lies and this book is full of errors. You can easily find the facts agenst most of the things she says. Wow, It is really sad that people can have that much hate inside of them"
3,"The New ""Right Lite""","An amusing book, but hardly worth the time & expense. This stuff IS the media mainstream now, the political equivalent of so-called ""reality"" shows. Classic liberalism died along with Hubert Humphrey's defeat in 1968, so conservatives have been forced for years to create a paper enemy out of a mildly left centrism in order to have something to fight. Liberalism now is merely tolerance slanted toward certain favored ""identity"" movements, an easy target indeed. Lightweight liberalism begets this sort of ""right lite"" commentary. Coulter can say anything she wants with impunity, because there's no Paul O'Dwyer types around anymore to kick her ... for it."
2,Mediocre at best,"I picked up this book at Barnes and Noble on a whim. Coulter does not make a single coherant argument in the entire book. It is packed with slippery slopes. To sum it up, this book is utter trash. If you want to spend money on a political book that has some value, try Noam Chomsky's Understanding Power."
2,"Love her articles, disappointed in book","I was so excited when Coulter's book arrived and I sat down comfortably to what I felt was going to be a treat of conservative insight into liberal lies. The lies were there, but far too often Ms. Coulter was doing the exact same thing she accused the left of doing, name calling. Her own name calling of the left was childish and detracted greatly from the message, albeit, an important one that she was attempting to make in this book."
1,"hypocritical, name-calling garbage","from one who supposedly condems liberals for resorting to name-calling. as usual, ms coulter resorts to making page after page of outlandish claims (which she backpeddles from when confronted during television appearances). this is one of the most excrutiating reads i've ever endured. and lets not forget the fact that ms coulter wouldn't know a liberal if she saw one (she actually thinks that bill clinton, advocate of coroprate welfare, the wto, and welfare ""deform"" is a leftist!) this book is a blessing in disguise for liberals. the more exposure this vile woman receives, the worse conservatives look.if you want the truth on liberalism and what it's all about, then i'd suggest giving senator paul wellstone's excellent ""the conscience of a liberal"" a read."
2,Right wing drivel,"I read this book and it was everything I thought it would be. I found myself laughing through most of it. Ms. Coulter's views are utterly ridiculous, and her ""facts"" present an extremely weak case for a liberal media. She, like most folks on the right, tries to cover up for a lack of intelligence or correctness or pragmatism on issues by proclaiming that any counter arguments to their misguided beliefs are the products of a liberal bias in the media. I find her book most childish."
1,Misinformation,"This book was written simply as a quick money-maker, and has no educational value at all. To say that the media is totally left-winged is idiotic. Turn on any cable news channel and see for yourself: they are all conservative. If you are a right-winged individual who hates Clinton, you may get a few chuckles, but that is about it. I am not left-winged pundit, but I find that she is constantly hypocritical throughout the book, and inconsistent in her reasoning.This woman is known for being loud and abrasive. Her newest book continues this tradition for no apparent reason, except of course, to make some quick bucks."
1,Anorexic Annie Strikes Out Again,"What is with this woman? If she isnt lying about her age, she's lying about alleged lies told by somebody else. Lets hope the bulimic bonerack made enough jack to keep her in whiskey and smokes until her next pack of unfunny lies flushes into the publishing sewer system."
1,LIAR,"Terrible, but wonderful at the same time. I am glad that she has become a leading spokesperson for the conservatives in this country. She is a liar, mean-spirited, and someone who only complains and doesn't offer any suggestions. Check out her attempt to document her ""sources"" and her flimsy endnotes. She bends the ""truth"" to suit her own needs. No she isn't the first, or the last, but I really don't know how this woman sleeps at night. Only in America....."
2,Entertaining...,"It was definatly an entertaining read. She is obviosuly very passionate, but does tend to profess a lot of hate speech. If she would tone done the rhetoric and hire a couple of more fact-checkers, I would have been able to take the book a little more seriously."
1,Ugh...,"Oh, I loathe Ann Coutler. She seems to blame liberals for almost EVERYTHING!!! This is further proof that mature adults sometimes act like little children. What has happened..."
1,Talk about slander...,"This is the single greatest literary example of the pot calling the kettle black.Ms. Coulter is betting people will be bowled over by her footnotes. Call her bluff. Go to the library, take this book and look up some of her footnotes. Several of the articles she cites do not say what she says they say. Either she is a liar or she has a severe disability in reading comprehension. Whichever is the case, it certainly calls into question her credibility as a pundit."
2,Suicide blonde,"Physical beauty, articulate - but often meaningless - speech, and blonde hair do not compensate for such nuggets of anti-wisdom as: ""Liberals have been wrong about everything in the last half century."" Surprise news flash! A conservative being shocking and sensationalistic! Wow! How novel.For starters, liberals were right about pollution in Houston decades before the GOP there would admit anything!To spend money on this book which is just as easy to skim through, then wipe with at your local library (which wouldn't exist without ""liberals"") is a horrible and unjustified utilization of these pages.Sinking hard-earned money (middle class liberals, read ""harder"") into this book is not nearly as appealing as muting the TV and watching the author move in silence. Beauty becomes beast quite quickly in this era of bigot-worship.On the up side, she looks a heck of a lot better than O-Reilley and at least seems to have more brain power.Ahhh, if only she could utilize it better."
1,Pure Drivel From an Angry White Person,"What prompts someone to make such blanket statements on subjects she obviously knows little about?Should be listed under ""fiction""."
1,Blah blah blah,"Leave it to the likes of Coulter and her ""We are so far to the right, you all should be getting scared"" gang to produce yet another liberal bashing book. I didnt like her tone nor her writing and threw the book in the trash where it rightly belongs. Shame on you, Ann. Shame."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"As a conservative thinker myself I wish that I were able to recommend this book. Unfortunately, it is pure and simple trash. Ms. Coulter offers absolutely nothing of substance. Frankly, her inflammatory statements injure the conservative agenda by making us appear unintelligent. Her inability to express herself is actually quite embarrassing. Clearly, she is only seeking to ""cash-in"" on her former success in criticizing Bill Clinton. Moreover, her attempts to support her views on television made me cringe with embarrassment."
1,Typical Coulter Lies and Slander,"This chick need a liberal dose of meat. She's from New Caanan CT.(Median household income :$141,592.00 National avarage, $39,968.00) which is about as Waspy and priveliged a place as you'll find in the USA. There are NO black people in New Caanan. It's kind of like Idaho. She doesn't speak for any one else. It is her analysis also that things are going ""swimmingly"" in Iraq, I guess from her perpective, stirring a drink by the pool, they are. Why anyone cares what this IDIOT says is beyond me.sincerly, Jeff Gannon"
4,Can't you take a joke?,"I imagine it might take years for you people to understand: this book is supposed to be a joke! You people take yourselves so seriously that you don't even notice Ann's wry grin or silly smile as she says things like ""Women shouldn't vote"" in talk shows. People: She is a WOMAN!!! Let me spell it out: S H E ' S J O K I N G. How does the saying go? Wake up and smell the coffee! If I could, I would give you all a sense of humour. Although I suppose all you dorks probably enjoy being clueless one way or the other. I would advise you to buy this book and laugh a little."
1,Ignorance thy name is Ann,"Everyone is a least a tad bit judgemental but for some reason Ann Coulter thinks her judgements are logical. She hates people because they are not exactly like her. That's as ludicrous as me saying I hate people because their eyes are brown. Ann is a strong believer of following the teachings of the bible, but at the same time is hypocritical enough to go against the ""love thy neighbor"" part and slam liberals for being uneducated sheep. I can fully understand someone having strong viewpoints about issues that are important to them, but it makes you look like a mindless oaf if you bash everyone that happens to think differently. Funny how the word slander gets used to in the title when Ann seems to be playing an ""adult"" version of I know you are but what am I. If you can't appreciate people for who they are (gays, minorities etc.) then you are the one that's truly UnAmerican and I hope you rot on your self righteous throne."
1,What utter crap,I wish there was an option for voting nil stars for a book. I feel like sending her a bill to recover the costs of the book and overseas shipping.
1,Extreme ignorance,"Coulter is a very interesting person. She has written a book based on her opinions and passes them off as truth. This book is very painful to read because the reader is trying to understand politics from a woman who did not see the message or truth in Bowling for Columbine. She, instead refers to Michael Moore not as a filmmaker or author but as "" college dropout Michael Moore ....ect... This is how she refers to him and to many other people in her novel. She has no respect for others and can't even think abstractly, which is sad considering her education and current employment. She needs to stop this kind of hatred and realize that ignorance will turn off any curious reader with a brain."
1,Challenging only if you don't speak English,"I can't believe the people that said this book presents a ""challenging"" alternative viewpoint! I voted for Bush and am a fairly devout Republican but this is the most idiotic drivel I've heard in my life! Anyone that can be so black and white about politics and believes that all alternative viewpoints are wrong and dangerous (ironic since she is trying to defend the Right from the slander of the Left, then turns around and does the same) is hardly a model American citizen. Ann Coulter is the Michael Moore of the left--a blind, self-absorbed reductionist, who doesn't believe that the word ""democracy"" means living with alternative views."
4,Liberals will choke on this detailed breakdown of the media,"Although I prefered the last 2 books that Ann wrote, I found this read to be informative and straight to the heart. While exposing Dan Rather and Katie Couric as slanted and biased liberals is like exposing Richards Simmons as feminine, Ann took the time to clearly show the whitewashing of the Republican Party as fanatics by the mainstream press. I'm sure the folks at the soon-to-be defunct Salon.com are screaming in there sleep over this book. I think you'll find it a good read and worth the purchase."
5,Conservative tells the truth!,"Slander is a great read. This book must be read by moderate Americans to open their eyes to liberal hate speech.As a conservative every day the networks tell me that I am evil.Thanks to FOX I have a more balance news program to watch. I feel diversity is important and the country needs political thought that is more diverse than Rather, Jennings, Brokaw and now Stephanoplis. How anyone can deny liberal bias in the media and keep a straight face is beyond me. Keep up the great work Ann."
1,"A very strange ""book""","I wanted to get some insight into all of the liberal bashing going on these days, so I read Slander. All I learned was that the author is very unhappy about most of the reporting done by the media (except Fox News?) and labels it liberal. No working definition of ""liberal"" is even offered.The author also throws in a great deal of tirades about Bill Clinton, as if that makes her points.If you go in for this sort of thing, you will probably find Mike Savage's rants more entertaining."
5,Negative comments about this book proves its point ...,"...The facts and quotes of this book are verifiable... If you are honestly looking for facts, the book is worth reading."
3,convoluted elocution,"I purchased this book hoping to enjoy more of Ms Coulter's wit and straight-forwardness. Instead I found her paragraphs hard to comprehend and chocked full of phrases that could only be appreciated by a PhD in Thesaurus Science. Did Ann Coulter really write this? Ms Coulter, in my opinion, has gained the admiration of conservatives and even the respect of liberals by her oral communication. It is a shame that her 'sit-up and take notice' style did not come through in her written media. If her editor reads this, please delete her dictionary and disable her thesaurus for her next book. Possibly let her talk into a dictaphone to let her natural, familiar, and relatable persona shine through. Then let someone else wield the pen(or keyboard).Her messages are enthralling and her passion is compelling. This book contains some dynamic revelations. We still love you, Ann, but I must admit I was disappointed in your writing style."
5,Slamming Katie!!,"I found this book to be very insightful. I bought it after I saw Katie Couric get very snippy with Ms. Coulter on the Today show so I had to buy the book to see why Katie had her back up and her claws out.While liberals always generalize about conservatives, Ms Coulter has done a terrific job of itemizing the specific issues and instances from reliable sources. What the liberals can't stand is that someone is smoking them out and calling them what they are, liars, slanderers and fear mongers"
1,She talks bad. But she writes worse !,"I thought she talked bad. I change my opinion. She writes worse. This is the third joke book in the series after ""Mission Compromised and Invasion."" She forgets that after the war is over, it it is the liberals who take care of the victims - not her blood soaked conservative hangers on."
1,"Ann Coulter: Liberal Lies; Blah, Blah, Blah.....","The objective reader should be able to quickly and readily discern that Ms. Coulter is to authors what Jerry Springer is to talk show hosts. But, sensationalistic books do sell (truthful or not)!Any 'ditto head"" with a taste for Rush on steroids should just LOVE this book!!"
1,AAHHH!!!,"I seriously think that poor Ann was dropped on her head as a baby a few to many times. It is quite ironic that she accuses liberals of slander throughout the entire book, when slander is all that comes out of this woman 24/7!"
1,"Ann Coulter, crazy","Ive read several of these reviews where people say all kinds of things about how reliable her sources are, and about how she has 780 footnotes. Unfortunetly, your all wrong. I read the book, and there are 780 ENDNOTES. Not footnotes. theres a big different. The book was also horrible, which is to be expected with such a crazy person. If you want proof of the right wing bias in the media, simply go to www.moveon.org, and learn about how CBS censored an anti-bush ad during the super bowl"
1,I was surprised how much this didn't vibe with me,"I had a difficult time sinking myself into Coulter's world. I picked up this book so that I might be able to give myself a few pointers for arguements against some of my liberal friends. This is just some paper soup to make money, and the information is not very helpful at all. Coulter is like a paranoid conspiracy theorist with an addiction for tradition. The second word in the title says it all!"
1,instantly disposable,"This is the latest tirade from the swelling niche of extremist pundits trying to cash in quickly on the naivite and ,dare I say it, slanderous misconceptions of a misinformed public hungry for easy answers and a reinforcement of their dearly held prejudices through faulty data. There are lies, more lies and then there are Ann Coulter's statistics. She has a palpable hatred of anything that doesn't conform to her preposterous worldview where the only solutions to every conundrum are more guns or more Jesus. How long can it be until Ann and her ilk will want to arm Jesus to wipe off her adversaries?. Her illogical rants border on the hysterical and serve one purpose only: to stuff her wallet while prescribing sentiments that were already old and tired 50 years ago."
1,I'm MAD AS HELL,"This book makes me so mad I got to whack myself in the face with it just to stop sputtering! Ann nails me and my ilk with her intelligent and insightful writing. I am especially angry with my fellow travellers who gave this book 1 star, because they showed themselves to be as STUPID as I am!! DOG GONNIT!!"
3,Ann is Al,"The reason that Ann Coulter and Al Franken despise each other so, is because they are the same. They both are both passionate, well-educated, and artiuclate. In addition, they are both egotistical, whiny, and blame everyone else for thier unhappiness. They lie on opposite sides of the political arena. When you read this book or Lies..., remember that they are BOTH giving you their side and only their side of the story. I gave this book 3 stars just like I gave Lies... 3 stars. It's the same book."
1,The pot calls the kettle 'black.',"Coulter's ""Slander"" proves one thing: Americans will buy just about anything. Coulter ""ditto heads"" aren't just buying the book though, they're also buying into the spew contained within!Any person with a scintilla of intelligence will reject Coulter's nonsense for what it is: a transparent attempt to SLANDER those with a different viewpoint as something slightly less evil than Satan.Maybe someone should tell the pot (Coulter) she is every bit as 'black' as the kettle she accuses. Maybe someone should give her a mirror?"
1,This book is awful,"I read this so-called heavily researched book, and got a lot of great belly laughs at just how poorly written and researched it really is.Coulter says the fact that ""far right wing'' came up about 10 times more than ""far left wing'' in the NY Times Nexus search ""proves'' that it is slanted to the left. Well, guess what? The Washington Times - a paper renowned for its right wing slant - had the same percentage on the same Nexus search.But, of course, Coulter didn't put that in her ""book.''Coulter said liberals only give us invective instead of argument, but calls Katie Couric the ""likable Eva Braun of morning TV.'' Yeah, no invective there.If you want a truly good read that exposes (fakes)like Coulter, read David Brock's ""Blinded by the Right.'' He has the revealing sentence, ""In 12 years writing for the right wing, not once was my work subject to fact checking.''Neither was this horrible book."
3,Those in the middle of the road...,"... tend to get run over.My opinion on anyone reading this book is that they already go into this either believing they'll love it or hate it. My, my, aren't I the dissenter to be almost ambivalent towards it...The good news is: if you're conservative, you're going to love it.The good news is: if you're liberal, you're going to hate it.The bad news is: Thus far, I find no solution to opening up a discussion of politics as a free-flow of constructive ideas bent on formulating policy instead of casting blame & calling names...The thing is, one reads a book like this to validate his or her own opinion or to denigrate those of others - conservatives: ""We all knew the liberals were these complete pongs who control the media""; liberals: ""We all knew the conservatives were wimpy whiners who can only blame their unpopularity on the media.""Both sides: grow up, tell the truth, stop playing games on my tax dollar."
1,"Hyperbolic, silly, and misinformed","...Ann Coulter comes from the Rush Limbaugh school of conservativism- instead of using facts or numbers to support arguments, make flippant, insulting remarks or simply not allow them to speak. While their ignorance is entertaining, it's sad that so many people turn only to people like them to get their news.This book appears heavy on facts to bolster her arguments, but, when checked for validity, many of the footnotes provide very weak reinforcement or none at all...Regardless of political affiliation, please don't choose a side and then tune in to talking heads who simply spew out rhetoric that panders blatantly to the left or right. Sadly, both sides are so close-minded that they cannot see that both sides are correct, and both sides are wrong. As with most things in life, the best course for our government lies somewhere in the middle."
1,Christian?,"Every time I read this book I fail to understand where ""Christianity"" enters her writing. I also fail to understand where the ""liberal lies"" are that the vast majority of Republicans are no longer moderate, intellignet people of the same cut as Eisenhower, Regan or others that I know. This woman is simply seeking to rial people and that sells books. Her writings have nothing to do with what christ teaches. Stay away from those that seek to create problems between christians. Republicans seek out the true history of the party and adhere to it - dont be given to rancorous rhetoric..."
1,"Oh, Ann! You just bust me up...","I love reading Ann Coulter's books back-to-back with Al Franken and Michael Moore. I tell ya, this stuff keeps me rollin'. Her conspiracy theories and middle-school disses are perfect in this book! I swear I knew a gal just like her back in south Georgia in sixth grade.But on the point of reviewing, this book is only valuable for its comedy content. Miss Coulter is shallow, sallow, pallid, angry about who-knows-what (and I don't mean politics), and she fabricates her research. I don't mean to say that she does POOR research - I mean that for this book she seems to have invented it entirely.Oh Ann... I really wish I could find that review that so convincingly explained the evidence that you are in fact a man.Ta!"
1,Ms. Slanderer,"What a depressing book. How is it that those people who constantly complain about the coarsening of our society and the harsh partisanship of our politics, turn a harpy like this into their goodess? Read this only if you can't find the same stuff for free almost every where you turn on your radio dial."
1,For Pete's Sake,"You've got to be kidding! Books like this are the reason that we cannot have serious debates in this country about how to move forward on divisive issues. The opening chapter is chock full lies and mistruths. The opening paragraph is meant to further divide Americans from each other by first playing the race card and then the religious one. I had hoped that this book would provide some insight into ""real"" slander beliefs, instead it is another slanderous diatribe by a not too gifted writer and thinker. Waste of your time."
1,evidence of a failled school system,"I am a republican, but I refuse to be classified in the same political sub-section with this obviously delusional woman. Her writing, logic and research are beyond poor, and I honestly think that what she needs are some good anti-psychotics to deal with her paranoia. I of course have a low threshold for hypocracy and illogical extremists, so yes, I suppose I am biased. But, seriously? Save your money. If you don't buy this book your almost a fourth of the way to a years subscription to the ""Economist""."
1,Plagiarism and Revisionism do not count as journalism,"Her work has been discredited and picked apart so much, it's pretty much common knowledge that if she opens her mouth or puts pen to paper, you'd better get on google or Nexis and do some fact-checking. Her writing style is sub-par, almost juvenile in nature and tone. I am beginning to wonder if she really believes all of the thing that she says. Maybe she is simply pimping hatred, ignorance, and poor journalism skills to make money, because she knows that there are plenty of rabid right-wing suckers out there willing to pay money to be had."
1,A short excerpt,"The first paragraph of this book:""Political 'debate' in this country is insufferable. Whether conducted in Congress, on the political talk shows, or played out at dinners and cocktail parties, politics is a nasty sport. At the risk of giving away the ending: It's all the liberals' fault.""Is she being ironic here? Or not? I don't get it. If you call American political debate ""insufferable"" in the first sentence, call politics ""nasty"" in the second sentence, and then make an incredibly inflammatory, insufferable and nasty comment in the third, are you a hypocrite? Or some kind of crazy genius?Was this intentional?"
1,Yawn!,"I didn't expect insight from Ann Coulter, but I did expect to be entertained. As one of a trio of shreiking blondes, she enlivened the TV pundit scene during the impeachment era. (She reminded me of a kid in a big family who has to resort to being outrageous to get attention.) But ""Slander"" is silly, and without Ms. Coulter to emote her words, boring. Well researched and footnoted? Puh-lease! If I'd turned in such a paper to my eighth grade teacher, I'd have been lucky to get a D.I give Coulter credit for being shrewd. It appears that she knew there was an audience for such drivel, and had no scruples against capitalizing on it. No doubt she's made a lot of money on ""Slander."" I'm just REAL sorry part of that money came out of my pocket. Don't make the same mistake. This book isn't worth your time, let alone your money."
1,Ann the Traitor,"Just like her last book ""Treason"" Ms Coulter ties to imply that Democrats don't love the US since they question Republican policies. Well, all I have to say is that I am watching CNN as I type and they are reporting that it is the Republicans that are the true traitors in America.What the White House did, exposing a CIA operative and risking the lives of hundreds and our national security is the true definition of a traitor. Lying to the country about the reason why we are going to war and killing hundreds of our troops for now reason is the definition of a traitor. Ann should be tried for treason along with the Bush administration."
1,We should invade their countries....,"""We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to christianity..."" Ann CoulterShe travels fast because she travels light...unburdened by facts or any deep reflection...Is she trying to be the dumb blonde of politics?"
5,Liberal bias in book reviews,"Miss Ivonne's review itself demonstrates liberal bias.She thinks she nailed Coulter for naming the book ""Slander"" rather than ""Libel"". Coulter's book was not solely about print media, was it (Katie Couric)? Talk about lazy, maybe Miss Ivonne didn't bother to read the book.Secondly, the article Dowd wrote in June 1999 did not have Gore as the ""object"". It mentioned Gore in one paragraph and it mentioned DeLay in five paragraphs (in addition to calling him ""The Terminator""). Strange way of making Gore the ""ojbect"" of an article. Read for yourself, do a google search using this search string: ""+Maureen +Dowd Tom +DeLay religiosity +June +1999""Lastly, she defends the media on the Bush AWOL story. We are all now aware of the CBS fraudulent documents. I realize she wrote her review before the CBS debacle, but it just demonstrates how wrong Miss Ivonne is, even years later.Just read the book and disregard most or all reviews of politically charged books."
1,Is this for real?,"Wow! I have never read anything so full of hate and bile. This woman accuses ""liberals"" of a certain behavior and then goes on to exhibit it herself. As someone who is considered very ""conservative"" on many issues and ""liberal"" on others, I find this book offensive. Please, someone tell me this is a joke! She could not possibly be a rational, thinking human being. I suspect she is a publishing company's creation aimed maerely at provoking anger and outrage."
1,Supporting this woman is like supporting 9/11,"As soon as I read the first paragraph I choked. Surely EVERY problem in our country, EVER little thing, is not the fault of liberals.I mean, what about that woman on TV spouting about 9/11 victims using the system. Oh wait..."
1,Typical screeching dittohead nonsense,"I don't know where to begin, really. Coulter seems to think by footnoting quotes from ""liberals"" she establishes some legitimacy for this appalling screed. It would be funny if it wasn't so sad, since some people actually eat this stuff up and put some stock in it. Unfortunately, a lot of political discussion in this country has been reduced to Coulter's level, due to the simple-minded dumbing down of the discussion by the likes of Limbaugh, the Fox News Channel, and other empty talking heads. Read only if you have a strong stomach, or if you are a dittohead and need more propping up of your bankrupt belief system."
5,of course liberals hate her!,"Look at all of these 1-star reviewers! It just goes to show one thing: liberals cannot stand someone who exposes the hypocrisy of THEIR ideology! Keep up the good work, Ann!"
1,"More of the same-old, same-old ...","The average reader is probably not going to find much in the way of original thought in this book. For example, Coulter says all the country's ills are ""liberals' fault,"" which I've heard time and again from other conservative opinion hawkers. And interestingly enough, this woman does the old ""pot calling the kettle black"" by stating the liberals are ""bitter and angry."" Hmmmm....and conservatives aren't??? Witness Michael Medved or the always-good-for-a-laugh Rush Limbaugh. These and others of their ilk reveal the pervasive hypocrisy rife in the rightists' party. I say, give me Molly Ivins any day of the week; she tells it like it is, and she gives conservatives AND liberals a well-deserved tweak when they need it. Thumbs down to Coulter for trying to capitalize on the current wave of conservative backlash with this vitriolic tome."
2,Coulter vs. Franken,"This book was an enlightening read...or should I say...would have been if the facts stated it in were true. This book is best read not as the unequivocal truth, but instead as a small insight from the ultra-conservative side of Ann Coulter. She contradicts herself many times (ex: The democrats resort to name calling--and republicans don't...Then she says how all democrats are stuck up and stupid). For both sides of the debate, after reading Slander, read Al Franken's book ""Lies: and the Lying Liars who tell them."" Franken sheds light on some discrepencies in Coulter's book, but he nearly succeeds in making Coulter's point for her: That democrats don't write about anything except how the republicans are so bad. I recommend reading both and deciding for yourself."
1,"mistake-filled, vitrolic, emotional, contradictory","it's a shame this kind of [book] passes for ""informed discourse"" in today's society, it almost makes one feel sorry for the republicans and conservatives who claim this book as some kind of model of good writing. clearly, there are too many errors, invectives masquerading as 'facts,' mean-spirited personal attacks, and plain old nonsense for any intelligent person to bother in detail. But for conservatives, I'd have to say don't waste your time with this, because in a few years when no one listens to her nonsense anymore, you'll be embarrassed you read this instead of say, The Fountainhead. Utter silliness."
3,Why is Ann so angry?,"If your a moderate Republican or McCain supporter, this is NOT the book for you. Ann doesn't like us very much. Seems she equates anybody that doesn't share her opinion as a liberal. And liberal is a dirty word in politics.Also, Ann is very angry about alot of things but I don't understand why. Most folks see thru the obvious liberal media bias in this country, which is the probable point of her book. If we didn't, then the entire Congress and Presidency would be consistantly Democratic. Right?Anyhow, she has some good points and does some good research but nothing is black and white. Also, I can't get over her attacks on the moderates."
1,Why did you have to execute my Teddy? :'(,I don't get it! He was such a good Republican and then WHAM! You use your beloved capital punishment against your own Theodore Bundy!
1,Toss Another Book on the Hate Pile,"This book is another example of the eroding nature of political discourse in this nation. Ms. Coulter demonizes everything to the left of Newt Gingrich.No facts, of course- no substantive points. Only strawman arguments, half-truths, and flat-out lies...."
1,Its hardly Journalism,"I started this book with high hopes. It had been on the bestseller list for months and I was interested in what new theory or point of view the author could present to an open minded reader. Within the first 2 pages her point and case are made through one word quotations, lifted from numerous sources and, which she slings about with admirable zeal. And while I can understand the reaction people have to how the 'liberal' media has glossed over topics big and small on both sides of the political spectrum, this book is an insult to anyone who isnt quite so easily marked by a party line. While some of the reaction to this book has been beyond the pal in terms of rudeness towards the author. The book is not that good. As always read for yourself and find out but perhaps give it a skim at your local library before you buy it."
2,The unintended effects of silliness,"If I were a liberal I would thank Ms Coulter a hundred times over.Her book, and subsequent publicity appearances are the best thing that has ever happened to their cause. Does anyone else think it's at least a little funny that someone who constantly cries about a lack of exposure by the 'liberal media' is on TV pretty much every night? Coulter and her cronies spend all their time slamming others without injecting any policy (other than not liking Bill Clinton). Then, when the tables are turned and they are evaluated, their skin turns incredibly thin. When thier side loses, Ms. Coulter and others blame the messenger which - besides a being a blanket and elitist condemnation of the intelligence of the american people - is a paranoid myth that has really gotten tired."
2,"Coulter, unamerican","The book highlights the hypocrisy of today's right wing pundit: the author romanticizes war without having fought, pushes tax cuts that assist no one but herself and her elite friends, advocates cuts in education knowing her family will never need public education and launches unamerican personal attacks on political opponents in the name of ""patriotism."""
3,Too right wing...,"Coulter makes good points about the obvious liberal bias in the media and the lies perpetrated by the major outlets. She does make her point but has factual errors which detract from her credibility. First, Reagan did NOT end the cold war as so many people who have not read scholarly history books about the event can prove and Clinton did NOT `rape' anyone, it was ALL consensual. She comes off overbearing, somewhat like a conservative Hillary but she is MUCH more tolerable than the former and A LOT better looking. While I appreciate her conservative views, her use of the liberal left's tactics detracts from her popularity."
1,Don't be fooled,"Ann Coulter believes that if you say a thing stridently enough, it will be true. This entire book is an exercise in sophistry, and it's a sad commentary on American culture that she gets any attention at all. Ms. Coulter is, in the end, a circus freak willing to say and do just about anything to get attention. Do you really want to take your ideas about politics in America from someone like this?As Bill Maher said to Coulter a few weeks back -- when she actually had the gall to claim that George W. Bush got into Yale on his own merits -- Coulter just makes this [stuff] up."
2,Can we give her to the democrats?,"I consider myself a die-hared Republican, so I figured I would be right in tune with ""Slander"". Instead I found myself bored by what I can only describe as a whiny rant. I have never cared too much about what liberals say about my beliefs, and I don't expect them to care much what I think about them. Ann Coulter would have you believe that every liberal is ""out to get us"" just like the wacko left wingers who think there's a big business conspiracy out to get the ""little guy.""The fact is most people on both sides are reasonable people with different ideas who engage in sometimes spirited debate. What we don't need is to revel and whine about our opponents views, and instead focus on building strength in our own convictions. I have come to find Ann Coulter to be a right wing version of Al Sharpton. She is the kind of advocate we don't need."
2,"Not bad, drags toward the end","Coulter is fun to watch on TV but this book meanders a bit. I don't thing writing is her strong suit. You could do worse but you could do better. Buchanan, Rush, those guys can make a point. Coulter comes across as fanatical, but unsure of why. It's one thing to say you are a true conservitive, it's another thing to milk it for speaking fees at colleges."
1,Thirteen simple words.,"""We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity""Thirteen words from the author are all you need to know about what this book is going to be like. Persumably she wants to convert the Muslims- ""Take the Christian and the Jew as your friend"" the Koran states clearly, a sentiment of peace not so readily offered in the Bible and by the Right. Perhaps the Islamic world would like to invade America and do unto Ms. Coulter as she would do unto them.Oh by the way, I know what your thinking, I was raised a Protestant, and I despise political correctness and overly-liberal patronisers. This probably doesn't sit too well with how I critisised your beautiful poster girl, does it?"
1,"For all the slander she throws at liberals, she ends up bashing her own !","I can't imagine that even a lot of conservatives would have taken this book seriously if they had actually read it. Coulter sure knows how to find fault but offers the reader no solution out of the so-called mess she cries about. For all the generosity the media has given these lunatics, it's amazing how low they'll stoop to accuse their own generous ones of aiding the other side. If you're going to read it, pour some Pine Sol on it and then her crap will make any sense !"
2,Blah,"I'm somewhat liberal, and her personal vendetta of generalizing liberals makes her sound as evil as those she hates so much. Bias, by Bernard Goldberg is a much better book. I do agree that many liberals name call, avoid the issues, etc., but assuming that ALL of them do it is offensive. Media should always be critical of what a government or any organization (left or right) is doing; so if that makes them liberal, so be it.A pro-government, ""gung-ho"" press worries me more. . .She does make valid arguments, and valid arguments should always be welcome. Goldberg's Bias is much better."
2,Ann Coulter still searching to write a book on something she is 1/2 competent about,"Pat Roberston and Jerry Falwell blamed the 9/11 attacks on atheists, gays, feminists, abortionists etc. Did he mention the awful job that Bush (who was president for 8 months after all) did in preventing the attacks? No. Falwell stated and Roberston agreed that those groups let a deity to take away his supposed umbrella of protection away from America. So, these ""blame America"" first individuals blame an attack committed by religious nuts on freethinkers and securlarists? Coulter's reaction in her book, well it was wrong for Walter Cronkite to criticize these nutjobs. Isn't Coulter big on this kick of all who criticize rightwing presidents are traitors, unamericans, unpatriotic, etc? I guess blaming America and not the terrorists doesn't count, huh?"
1,Can't Ann Fact Check?,"What is it with Ann and her inability to have her work properly fact-checked before publication? From the first mistake (in the first chapter regarding Jefford's voting record) to the last, this is just shoddy workmanship. Not only shoddy workmanship, but arguments are made with such venom and hysteria that they can't be taken seriously. Gee, who's guilty of slander now?"
1,Someone should HELP this woman!,"I've watched Ann Coulter on TV with a combination of amusement and wonderment. Her verbal tirades, where she lowers her voice an octave or two, and spews off conservative venom, attacking personally anyone or anything to the left of Attila the Hun are hilarious to watch! I was curious to see if in her writing she gave more thought to her attacks, and more substance. After reading this book, the only conclusion I could come to is that this woman [might be] seriously mentally ill. I am not kidding!..."
1,Not Much Truth,"Why the right wing media is so intent on covering up their own slanted views of the world and blame everybody else, I'll never understand. Coulter, a David Duke in drag look-alike, doesn't bother to attempt at truth. She is perfectly happy doing the ususal right wing thing of attack, attack and attack, without any regard to keeping her facts straight.If you enjoy the right wing dominated media, you'll love this pack of one liners built around the concept that everyone who disagrees with any aspect of the right's view of life, is anti-American, a traitor and mis-informed. I have to wonder, did any of these types ever spend any time in their American History classes actually paying attention. We are a nation built from dissent, yet dissent is never tolerated in Ann Coulter's world. You disagree - you're a traitor. Trash this book. In another fews years, it will be looked at for what it is, a right-wing attack on America and true American values of honesty, diversity, and fair play."
1,What a Piece of Trash,"Her 'footnotes' are wrong. That's all I have to say. Wrong, wrong, wrong.She is as biased as you can be. But I guess the FoxNewsies love that."
3,Very Interesting,"Ann Coulter's Slander was very intriguing and rather compelling.I wasn't aware of the various tactics that liberals employ todiscredit conservatives. I also was a bit shocked at how liberalsverbally bash conservatives, rather than discuss the issuesintellectually. The various strategies that are used on the poli-tical battlefield are very brutal and nefarious. This book wasalso an eye-opener for me since I am a liberal myself. While Ido see the hypocrisy in some liberal statements, I don't thinkthey are avaricious and relentless as Coulter portrayed them tobe. This book was very informative, and presented good arguments.I would definitely recommend it to anyone: conservatives or liberals."
1,Bias plain and simple,It's funny how the new fanatical religous new right claims to be the victim. They all say there is a liberal bias when in truth they are afraid of objectivity because it does not further their neo conservative cause. In her latest effort of trying to be a writer she falls flat on her face. The good news is you can always recylce.
5,Skeweringly funny,"I read Treason in a couple of days - it was hard to put down, and I kept reading bits out loud to my husband. There aren't many books that skewer sacred cows, deepen one's understanding of history, and make you laugh out loud repeatedly. This is a great book, and even if you don't (in the beginning, anyway) agree with everything Ann Coulter writes, you will definitely come out the other end knowing more about history, communist spies, and have taken a closer look at long held prejudices. Not boring paragraph in it, and very well researched."
2,Adds little to political discourse in United States,"A poorly written and researched book, ""Slander"" attempts to offer reasons why liberal policy and politics are inherently flawed. Coulter makes broad generalizations and stereotypes all liberals while using inconclusive sources to support her own theories. Intrisically, Ann Coulter disregards much of her own rhetoric about liberals being closed to alternative viewpoints by dismissing all liberal viewpoints. The intent of this work is clearly to provide a platform for political pundits that wears the guise of credible work. ""Slander"" does little to improve the political discourse in the United States, but effectively injects more divisiveness into the discussion.I would suggest David Frum as an author that more effectively and eloquently articulates the conservative world view."
1,there is something seriously wrong with Ann Coulter,"Ann Coulter has pointed many a fingers at liberals who clearly understand that she isn't the exactly `sane'. I under stand this too, and I'm only 11! I mean, who says `liberals hate America' while knowing what they are talking about? Slander is a great book, if you would like a laugh. I didn't even read the chapter called `the joy of arguing with liberals: there stupid!' because already I knew it was total poppycock. This book is good for raving conservative lunatics. For every normal person its good as a dartboard, a coaster, and a poorly made Frisbee."
1,More Republican Whining,"I guess if the Republicans didn't have so much to answer for, they wouldn't have to publish this kind of tripe. Please. As an Independent, no, the Democrats have not been lying about everything for the past half decade. Save your money for something without the right-wing bias."
1,a book you can wipe your butt with,"repeat after me you right -wing idiots there is no liberal media, ann coulter has the brain of a peanut and start thinking for yourselves . now go watch fox news and fry the remaining lack of brain power hearing limbaugh."
1,Guilty of her own accusations,"I tire of this endless absolutism. No single perspective is ever always right...and rarely are they always wrong. I feel sometimes as if I'm on a Junior High basketball court booing or cheering along with a group of vapid cheerleaders, villifying the other side of the gym with whatever venom I can muster...even when it's obvious they are pretty much just like we are.The fact that she mis-quotes and decontenxtualizes her sources is a real disappointment...it removes one more voice from meaningful public discourse."
1,Slander: The Title Says It All,"The aptly named ""Slander"" is a filthy bag of lies by an author who once told a reporter ""My only regret with Timothy McVeigh is that he did not go to the New York Times building"". That quote alone should tell us something about this woman. Ann Coulter is a glaring hypocrite."
5,Reality check,"I picked this book up after hearing it's author on the Matt Drudge radio show. I have to say....thank you Matt!!!Once I picked this book up, I couldn't put it down. Though I wish it were longer(200 pages), I enjoyed every minute of it. It took about one day to read.She combines facts with great humor. In addition, her book has footnotes which require an additional 50 pages to hold. Right after I finished, I bought ""Bias"" as a follow up.The truth hurts, and the negative reviews of some reviews demonstrates that. Her listing of events on election night 2000 are eye opening. In addition, she tells readers where some of our TV anchors and print media reporters got their starts(Working for democrats). Some people might not enjoy the book as much, probably because it is part of the ""right wing conspiracy"".I do have one complaint, someone else has already borrwed the book, read it, loved it, and given to a friend. I fear I will never see it again!! Don't lend it out."
1,The Saddest Book in American History,"The liberal-slanted media lie is a pervasive myth that is beaten to death in this muckraking opus from the greatest BS artist conservatives have ever seen. Without even basic fact checking on anything other that conservative think tank sites, Ann proves that you don't have to try to get into political writing."
3,A bit winey,"I must admit, I am a liberal. However, I looked forward to reading Coulter's book to learn more about the supposed liberal bias of the media. I found the book to have a ""wining"" tone. It was a list of name callings and examples of mistreatments. I think most of this is just public perception of conservative issues. I'm not convinced by this book that life (people's opinions) imitates art (media). It seems to me that the media is reporting more what the people want to hear. Still, I am glad I read Slander and did learn alot about the negativism of politics on both sides of the fence."
1,Too funny,"I think it's really quite funny that ""a reader"" from Dallas, Texas who posted on 4/27/03 states that he or she has been unemployed for the last eighteen months (Bush administration) but was quite ""well-employed"" during Clinton's presidency. Also, Iraq is not to blame for the September 11 attacks -- that's just another lie the the right-wing would love to have us believe. As for the book, well, having read it once, the only comparison I can draw is to escargot. It's interesting to try it, but once you realize what you're eating, you spit it out and never try it again. I would have given this book no stars, but unfortunately that wasn't an option."
1,Would never read her other books,"If this is a writer's idea of writing, I'll never read any of her other books. Frustrated writer or frustrated politician? It's no wonder - with written behavior like this - that our children don't stand a chance in the manners arena. I also watched her on Good Morning America with Charlie and was very sorry to call her a woman or an American. Someone her age should have better manners."
1,Ann's book = garbage!,"This book is a blatent display of ignorance. It lacks depth and credibility. Ann needs to do some research and read a few history books. Its easy to blame problems on people who have different opinions than you, rather than putting together a valid argument to support your own ideas and opinions.Thumbs down, Ann."
1,hot,"Ann Coulter is a fine, fine, fine woman; however, her writing skills are poor, poor, poor! As a ""flaming"" Republican I resent her use of sex to sell her book. (This is a typical liberal tactic which I abhor!) It's unfortunate, though she brings up a good issue or two, her desire to be ""sexy"" muffles any validity she may have had. Too bad."
1,fellow conservative is sorrowed by this book,"I gave it 1 star because I can't give it 0. Ann coulter tries to makes me think I'm a victim, or that we as conservatives are victims of liberalism lefties. This just couldn't be any farther from the truth. Her analogies and language are completely crude and useless (for me). Ann comes off very mean spirited. I'd like to see less spin and a clearer discussion of the differences cons. and libs. have."
1,Boring!,"This sounded like it was going to be a really good, informative book but it was just so silly and unrealistic that it grew dull fast. Like most extremists Ms.Coulter is only able to see things in black and white. You are either an evil conniving unpatriotic liberal or you are a noble and patriotic conservative. Basically the Saturday morning cartoon way of thinking. I enjoy well written and thought out books about both parties. This wasn't that kind of book. There are just too many lies and inconsistencies, it's basically one long diatribe. Very very dull."
1,I am uterly disgusted....,"We shall never achieve a peaceful, safe world, with bumbling idiots following this disgusting excuse for a woman. Look up some of her quotes on the internet, you'll see what I mean. I am ashamed that someone like this calls herself an ""American"", or even a ""woman"" for that matter. Read Al Fraken's Lies and the Lying Liars who Tell Them, for Ann Coulter is a lying liar, amongst other things."
1,She is not a Republican,Don't be fools. Coulter is no Republican. She is a media hound who is running our party into the ground by making us look brain dead to the American people. I wonder which side she is really on?
1,"lies, a load of bull","Ann Coulter makes up the whole book inside her paranoid, demented liberalphobic imagination. She makes broad, sterotypical, statements and then supports them with ""facts"" that simply aren't true. She has no credibility, since it is impossible to trust her opinions and her evidence as truthful. Ann Coulter is a perfect example, along with the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, etc. that the tongue of the right is that of a snake and they deserve our contempt."
5,Coulter's best work.,"""Slander"" was the first Ann Coulter book I had bought and read, and it remains my overall favorite today. Like all of Coulter's works, ""Slander"" is well-researched and well-documented, and her biting wit is razor-sharp. It's great to see all of these arrogant media elites get theirs, courtesy of Ann Coulter in her own unique style. I'm sick to death of hearing all these members of the leftist media deny that any liberal bias exists. Then as soon as they've finished denying any liberal bias, they go back to another round of Bush-bashing or spewing venom at Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter or whichever conservative they hate most at the moment. I've read and enjoyed all three of Ann Coulter's books, and I'm eagerly looking forward to her next one."
1,Disappointed,"As a conservative I was disappointed with Ann's book ""Slander"".Her book should have been called ""SPIN"" - Too much finger pointing without enough fact. A waste of money!"
1,Ann is U-G-L-Y,"Attractive blonde? are you kidding me? shes one of the nastiest looking woman in the mainstream media. I think she used to be a guy, look at her adams apple. Not that there's anything wrong with that. =)"
1,Don't waste your dollars !,"More hot air from Ann Coulter and her hired writers and editors! Coulter is obviously on someone's payroll and is clearly promoting someone else's interest. Her loud mouth and annoying voice have been well used to promote a divisive political ideology. She has been ironically launched by the corporate media as a puppet/pundit to serve the corporate agenda.Coulter's book has been well used by the Political boys' club. Her writings are an embarrassment to women everywhere on this planet.It is frightening and saddening to find out that Ann Coulter has become ""the new American dream"" !"
5,An important book at a critical time,Although Coulter's tone is often over the top her message is important and timely. This is a dangerous time and we need to hear views from all sides and not just from the PC controlled mass media. Unlike most books that talk about the media she has done her homework and has documented (with footnotes) the distortions that take place. After reading this book you will never hear the news the same way again: the use of name calling rather than discussing the issues is the rule. This was never productive but today it could lead to the loss of life. Buy the book and pass it on to a friend.
3,"Not bad, but","I love Ann Coulter, but I thought this book was a little lackluster. Her details and commentary are right on target, but personally I found the book to be a tad dry. [...]"
1,A Vituperative Volcano of Viciousness-And Nothing More,"""Liberals prefer invective to engagement""...that's enough right there to tell you just what a nauseatingly blatant hypocrite Ann Coulter is. And she herself must rely on invective for attention, because logic and reason are infinitely scarce in her case. Adolf Hitler engaged in this same type of vituperative propoganda over fifty years ago, so Ann Coulter doesn't fool me for a second. Actually I think she's absolutely pathetic in every sense of the word."
5,Truth--What a Concept!,"If you have an ounce of critical thinking in your body, you owe it to yourself to buy this book, study it, and then use it in defense of common sense--and hence against liberal blather. She is to conservatism and critical thinking what Rush Limbaugh is to conservatism and humor (with appologies to P. J. O'Rourke and Glenn Beck). I found myself wishing that she had written this while I was in grad school, so that I could have realized that I was fighting a losing battle by trying to use logic and facts against liberal emotion and name calling."
4,Response Extraordinare,"I consider myself neither a conservative nor a liberal. Being aware, however, of media bias, I do tend to form political opinions only after having heard the story reported from various outlets ranging from more left to more right. This being said, Ms. Coulter's book is one of the first I have read where ideology is planted firmly in the right. My first foray into the literary realm of the Republican party, proved to be an eye opening experience. Not overly long and tedious, Ms. Coulter's writing style flows well from page to page, not without an underlying hint of controlled rage. Her arguements are well referenced and clearly spelled out, encouraging the reader to question everything he or she has heard, believed, or insinuated about the Republican party. I recommend this book perhaps as a balance to a book written by a liberal author, perhaps to compare and contrast both views."
4,a good book,"This is a good book but you have to read it with an open mind. Coulter points out some very interesting tactics that Liberals use. First and foremost, did you notice how liberals often resort to name-calling and ad hominem attacks? Of course you did, but Coulter offers solid documentation on how often this actually occurs. If you read the book you will be surprised at the level of research that went into this book. Most poli sci books like this lack any kind of serious research. In this book, the footnotes are quite extensive. It is impressive."
5,Can't Hide From These Facts,"Ann Coulter, is at her hard-hitting best as she exposes not only the hypocrisy and bias of certain liberals, but their regular use of outright lies to promote their agenda and demonize Republicans. How low will the establishment media go to discredit those who disagree with them.? It's a lot worse than you could have imagined. The exact quotes are here for everyone to see. There is no way that one can read this book and not be amazed at the lack of journalistic integrity demonstrated by many in the ""news"" media. Coulter's keen wit and take-no-prisoners writing style make this an easy read."
5,Snobbery Exposed,"Ann's book is an excellent expose' of the liberal thought police. Her well documented exposure of the media and other facets of the liberal elite lends ample ammunition for those fighting the war for free speech. Reading some of the comments provided by those 1-star raters who have not read the book helps support her excellent arguments about liberals and their anathema toward freedom and open debate. One of her characterizations of the liberals really stood out, they are truly snobs who believe they are better than the majority of Americans and therefore, are not required to follow common rules of decency and civility. Thanks Ann for the doing the needed dirty work of exposing these elites!"
1,"American Right, stay away from me!","The libruls don't slander the American Right.It is not slander when a statement made is true.The American Right lacks veracity and therefore they deserve to be criticized. That is why libruls criticize the right. When the criticism is true, it is not slander. It is the truth.A good example is right here. Coulter's book has been shown to contain many false statements. Her footnotes have been shown to tell outright lies, or claim her enemies make statements they never made.To summarize: Coulter's posits do not hold up to scrutiny when you apply the scientific method.Remember: The American Right tells lies. The American Right wants to take away your freedom. Ignore them!"
5,Ann Rocks!,"Don't believe the propaganda in the main stream media. Ann tells it like it is about conservatives and liberals, and who's slandering whom (ok at the risk of giving it away--to quote Ann--it's all liberals' fault!)Read and enjoy!Tom"
1,Smarmy - not slander,My mis-steak I ordered this book and after a much disappointmentput the lousey book down and wondered - what the heck? Coulter is a smug and smarmy preppie liberal with more attiitude and arrogance (based on fiction) since....oliver North.
1,More chic-chick bull bashing political humanists,"What is it with these arrogant, wealty, well-supported belly-achers bleating out against those who try to offer even modest ideas for some form of social fairness? Is it not bad enough that we see the power of unprecedented privilege lurking in every corner, reeking in every media rag? Do we also have to put up with the cacaphony of a would-be Playboy pull-out complaining of unspeakable injustices to the rich? Or of the heinous criminality of those who would try to ask civil questions? The lady puts on quite a show. But this contraption called an author cannot be taken seriously by anyone with half a brain or a modicum of conscience. Except she is, in a nasty-spirited, unthinking, even unChristlike, gluttonous age. O tempore, o mores. Shame, shame, sick, sick, ick, ick, .... Enough time wasted on the oportunistic sewer-mouth, already. I guess it passes, fittingly, for contemporary intellectuality."
1,What a waste of money.,I could gain more useful information by hanging a magnet from a string and asking it questions. At least it will keep me warm this winter.
1,Rambling Biased Nonsense,"According to Ann Coulter, there isn't a single decent person who is politically left of Dick Cheney. Every single liberal lacks morals and is involved in some evil conspiracy in Ann's world. The book is strong on emotion(hatred mostly)but weak in every other way. This totally biased book actually accuses liberals of name calling when in fact she name calls and libels the left through the entire book. In fact the title should be ""Libel"" instead of ""Slander""."
1,A new queen of misinformation,"When I began this book, I was swept back to the Republican attacks on Dukakis. The book is a confirmation that when the right wing sees that they represent a narrow group of self serving individuals, who cannot look the American people in the face and say we are for this or that, they must project their feeling onto others. At that point, they pull out some right wing talking head and create a piece of tripe like this.Sincerely yours,drandmsde"
1,The perfect book for the mindless right-wing sheep,"This book is exactly what one of the previous reviewers wrote, ""a whiney rant."" Her proofs and footnotes do not checkout, and her quotes are completely paraphrased and inaccurate. But, I do recommend it if you just want to feed your preconceived notions and dislikes of anyone left of the extreme right.In conclusion, I would just like to say that I used to be a Republican."
1,I just don't get it. Why do people like this book?,"Now I'm no liberal. I called for Clinton's resignation and vote by the issue or how I feel about the candidtate, and I am certainly no fan of mainstream media or the Democrats. But I just can't understand how somebody as successful at Ann Coulter could take such a 1 sided view on so many issues, then proceed to preach using vague anectdotes and not giving any merit to the other side. If you really want to read a good book on the state of politics and the media today, read ""Stupid White Men"". It takes no prisoners and tells it like it is.As for the ""Liberal Biased Press"", I think the press isn't biased to one side or the other, it just doesn't want to make any waves. Look at the way it portray's GW, according to CNN he is the greatest thing since sliced bread, and you'll never hear any more about the election"
1,Full of it,"Ann Coulter is totally, completely full of it. There is really nothing in this book worth reading."
2,Some interesting points - at the price of Integrity,"This book has some interesting reading, but I just don't understand a lot of the hollering and complaining. I been watching politics for over 40 years, and ain't ever seen stuff like this.As a conservative, my biggest question: why are people like Ann pushing all the moderate conservatives to the other side? You think that'll win votes? When you pour nonsense like this on the fire...where are we going? The right wing is losing it's integrity. I've always voted Republican, but for the first time, I had a college kid call me a liberal. What's goin on?I ain't voting Democrat, but I ain't voting Republican no more either. I'm through with it. Read this book and you'll see...the right wing has sold it's soul and integrity for...for what?"
3,Not likely to be read by those to whom it would be useful,"The folks who are most likely to read a book by Coulter (conservatives and libertarians) are generally well aware of her thesis (mass media is dominated by proponents of the liberal point of view). As such, there really isn't anything new here.That said, Ms. Coulter does a thorough job of documenting this bias. On the downside, in pointing out the unsubstantiated generalisations of the left, she frequently throws out her own unsubstantiated generalisations as asides (for what its worth, I think most of her generalisations could be substantiated, but in a book that argues against such things, it seems a bit foolish for the author to commit the same sin).So, if you think mass media is objective or has a conservative bent, you should read this book and prepare to have your presuppositions challenged. If you already think the media is dominated by east and west coast liberals, I would suggest looking for something else."
1,Are you censoring our reviews?,"The last two reviews I have written have been critical of blowhard, drivelous conservatives such as Frau Coulter, and have not been posted. Is this a deliberate pattern? Have the conservatives so cowed you that you are afraid to let criticism be aired uncensored?"
1,just plain wrong,"It's ironic that Coulter complains about the bias in the ""liberal"" media when she herself had to go to bat for Micheal Moore to help get his book published, (""Stupid White Men""). WHile Coulter deserves a nod of praise for her efforts here, they clearly disprove her theory that there is a slant towrads the left in the media.Coulter is wrong."
1,POORLY WRITTEN AND LACKING IN LOGIC,"If this is an example of conservative intelligensia, then it is no wonder that the movement is in serious trouble.Sadly, too many ...have blindly accepted footnotes as an alleged example of thorough research and alleged documentation to substantiate the poor arguments made in this poorly written novel..."
1,"Read ""Bias"" instead","I'll get to the point: ""Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News"" is a much better book. ""Slander"" lacks structure and has been vetted by the conservitive press for making too many factual mistakes. Coulter (or whatever ghost writer wrote the book) just didn't do her research.""Bias"" on the other hand has withstood the test of time and defty exposes the real (rather than imagined) way that liberal bias gets into the news.If we want to win our battle with the liberal elements in the media we must be armed with the facts. Coulter has done more damage to our cause than good. It makes me wonder which side she is really on?"
1,Slandering the slanderers,"Coulter commits every one of the ""crimes"" she blames on liberals. This book is a rant about people who rant. She starts out sounding like she will present actual facts, and she does have a few sprinkled throughout the book, but in the end she resorts to name-calling, baiting, and gleeful dancing on graves. There are a few valid points, some are even made without too much invective, but she commits every one of the sins of stereotyping she so decries. Phrases like ""every liberal"" and ""all democrats"" are everywhere.This would have made a good pamphlet."
1,A Neocon's blatant falsehoods,I would give this book a MINUS 5 stars if I could. This OBNOXIOUS woman has been telling lies about any one who does not adhere to the rantings of the ultra-right wing of the Republican Party. She needs to get a real job and see how screwed up her political dogma really is.
1,ann-dy kaufman?,"How you feel about Coulter's book depends on how you see Coulter. Either she's 1). a hypocritical harpie totally incapable of seeing subtleties or nuance, totally humorless, totally unable to see the disconnect between writing a book called ""Slander"" in which she calls Katie Couric an ""affable Eva Braun"" (what exactly does that mean anyway?)....OR she's 2) A brilliant performance artist who's been doing an Andy Kaufman-esque act for the last 10 years, never letting the character slip for a second- kind of a political Tony Clifton. Her recent TV appearances on Today, Hardball, and Crossfire almost have me convinced of this- maybe Andy really is still alive! Either way, she's the liberals' best friend, making extreme conservatives look ridiculous. No one with a brain on either side of the political spectrum could possibly take her or this book seriously."
1,an embarrasment to conservatives everywhere,"'slander' is filled with just what its title indicates - slander. as a thoughtful conservative I am appalled that ms. coulter is being heralded as the voice of our movement. I feel no closer to her inflammatory one-liners than to david horowitz's equally delusional rantings. if you are seeking a genuine ideological critique of the left-liberal movement, look elsewhere. ann coulter offers no original perspective on american political conflict, but instead just dishes out the same shallow hate that got the libs mad at us in the first place. avoid this book."
1,The future is bleak indeed....,"Recently my daughter told me that when she grows up, she wants to be just like Ann Coulter. I sadly shook my head, sent her to bed without dinner and grounded her for a week. If my daughter ever emulates Ann Coulter in the form of lies, hate-filled comments, pure vitriol or juvenile name calling, than I will have failed miserably as a parent."
1,What's that??,"If the liberals were controlling the medias, let's just take an example with the war against the Iraqi people, we always just heard pro-war points of view and only 1% of all the news was anti-war. I am not inventing this, maybe you righist ignorants should read a little more Chomsky and Moore. Just compare the achievements of lefist parties around the world during the 20th century with righist ''sects'' achievements and dare to say Ann Coulter is intelligent and a good writer!"
1,just what you would expect,"repetitive, accusatory, the same dogma we've heard again and again from this type of 'author'"
1,I wasn't amused,Aren't books likes suppose to be entertaining? This book was just one long indignant rant. If there no entertainment then there is no redeeming value. I feel like someone that slow down to gawk at a accident.
1,...,"...I thought this might be an interesting read. I myself have no use for liberal propagnda we are inundated with on a dailey basis. However, I don't think Ann Coulter should be allowed to own a book much less write one after what I saw pressed betweent the covers of this one. I have never in my life read anything so BOOOOOORING and childish in my life ! Constant name calling and all the footnotes were ridiculous to say the least. When she paraphrased someone,I checked the footnotes in the back and saw the whole statement that person made, and she took it totally out of context ! If you are going to present your case about the drivel the liberal agenda thrusts on us, at leat do a better job of it than name calling and rhetoric...And I am a stauch conservative Republican by the way !!!!.."
1,Informative ?? Funny ???,"As for its informative content, this book is crammed with false or dubious facts.It would fail under any university examination.As for its humour... where is it ??? 8oJust look at the abstract on amazon !!!Maybe the author shows some wit in her ""writing"", but certainly not humour. And as someone (was it Voltaire ?) said : ""Wit has never proven anything.""If you want a really funny read, buy Michael Moore's books. At least, even if you don't agree with his views, you'll be rewarded with a big laugh."
1,Brimming with All-American Lies,"Where to start? If anything, the title ""Slander"" is appropriate. The book consists of nothing more than attacks on liberals that lack any factual basis whatsoever. As Al Franken aptly proved, every single page in this book contains lies, and often in mass quantities. She and other members of the far-right thrive on misinformation and brainwashing techniques in order to turn America into a nation of ""dittoheads"" who are physically unable to disagree with anything the President (better known as the Thief-in-Chief) says. This woman is simply a liar who is disgracefully unable to defend her position against anyone capable of arguing with her. Oh, by the way, Ann, Clinton's been out of office for quite some time now, so can we stop dwelling on the fact that he presided over the longest period of economic prosperity in the history of the country and you can't handle that?"
1,Ann Coulter is a Nutcase...,"All I have to say is that although her sources might support her writing, those sources have just as many conservative lies in them as her book."
1,Spins whatever she wants,"I try to read items that I would not necessarily agree with. However, this piece of doggerel is nothing but exagerrations, misquotes, and spin. She uses tacky research to make points that don't exist, then brushes off any critique as ""liberal bias"". If you are a conservative, please read something that will allow us to discuss matters. Coulters' book should be titled ""Slander: Liberal Lies I Made Up."""
3,What is for sale?,"The title says 10-piece; the picture shows only eight pieces.The features list says 10-piece; the description mentions only eight pieces.So, if we buy this, what do we get...?"
3,Set contains nonstick items,"Hmmm, maybe i'm dumb, and I clearly didn't read carefully enough, but when I buy a set called 'professional hard anodized' i don't expect to get two nonstick items in the batch. Alas, both saute pans have this surface which I personally hate ( well, nonstick certainly has its place, but I would buy a special nonstick pan for this type of cooking ). Problem is, you can't put a nonstick pan in the broiler or a very hot oven, so basically, you can't treat these as a true saute pan. sigh, now I have to buy these items separately, so I've wasted about half my money."
4,not too shabby,It is great cookware and easy to clean. Just make sure that you never use metal utensils with it. The non-stick finish scratched very easily.
5,COOKING WITH EASE,This is by far the best price I have seen for the best product. My son is a Chief and this is all he uses in his kitchen at home.
4,Metra 997890 review,"This kit looks good and arrived quickly.There is only one problem that I had which is that my 1/2 din equalizer would not fit in the supposed 1/2 din opening.I had to trim away enough plastic to allow my equalizer to fit,other than that the kit is great."
5,Can't say enough good things about Cedarmont,"Cedarmont DVDs are the best. All children should be able to view these. If you have only a few DVDs to buy for your child then you will not make a mistake with Cedarmont. I bought at least 12..(if you don't find all of them with Amazon, then you'll have to order from their actual website which is a little more expensive) Of all the DVDs from Cedarmont, I think the Action Songs series were my daughter (and mine..hehe) favorites. They make Action Bible Songs, and Action Toddler Songs---both excellent...but then again, get the othersExcellent product."
2,Errs on the side of cheesey,"There are a lot of great songs on this DVD. My toddler enjoys it, HOWEVER... it's a bit cheesey. I wish I could find a DVD where the kids or adults did the correct hand motions to the ""fingerplay"" songs instead of dancing around or making up new actions."
2,Meant for older kids,This dvd is great but for older kids. My 2 year was not very interested in it cause the music was mellow and not exciting for her.
3,Toddler Action Songs,The songs and singing are good. The lip movement could be better to match the singing. Otherwise it is ok.
1,"Terrrrrible! Not an ""action songs"" DVD","Should NOT be titled as an ""Action Songs"" DVD. Out of the 16 songs there are 4 that include actions and they are horrible! I'm a music therapist and this is probably the WORST selection of ""children's songs"" I've ever seen. Songs aren't even familiar to an adult much less a child. There are many many real action songs for children that could have been used. If the songs would have been listed to view before purchasing I would've never purchased it as I know they are not action song. Extrememly disappointing. Total waste of money."
5,A Classroom Project,"Mike Whicker tasked his high school Creative Writing class to produce a publishable book. They have succeeded, with flying colors. Not only is it worthy of publishing, but interesting and readable as well. A bit sophomoric, which is to be understood, ""Proper Suda"" depicts the Victorian life of a ""proper"" English girl who comes to America in the early 20th century. Her diary is found decades later, and provides a mystery to be solved by some present-day teens. Cleverly wrapped in football glory and local color, the characters are believable and interesting. A perfect example of what can be accomplished by a team of young ""Scribes"", with the proper tutelage of their teacher. Try it, you'll like it."
3,changing blades,"This saw has lots of power for resawing, but to change a blade to a smaller size is quite a pain. They have hex key bolts to loosen on the bottom gides that are very hard to reach and ajust. You also have to loosen key bolts on the upper ones also. You would think they would have designed ajustable knobs on both peices."
3,Okay quality for the price,"I have owned this product for a year. Like most Jet equipment I own, this one arrived with minor (nuisance type) damage from being dropped. I am wondering if Tool Crib purchases the damaged equipment from Jet at a reduced price to garner higher profit margins.The saw performs adequately although the accompanying blade did not have a long useful life. The rip fence is low quality and does not permit easy minor adjustments. The miter gauge is also poor quality. Maybe I'm spoiled by the more accurate fence on my table saw but for [price] I expected more attention to detail.I am using the saw at the lower power level although it can be rewired for higher power.I like the nice sized cast iron table but plan to build something larger to accommodate more intricate cutting.The blade guides are not high quality and you should plan to purchase a better quality set."
3,Get good blades!,"Good blades are critical to enjoying this machine. The four that came ""free"" were blunt within minutes. (Jet should not give out junk with it's machines, one good blade would be more useful).After six months of frustration with the Jet blades I bought two TimberWolf blades from Suffolk machinery, a 1/2 inch, (3 pitch) and a 1 inch (2 pitch). They are really really sharp! They cut striaght, quietly, effortlessly, and they were not expensive."
5,Great quality,"We typically buy Office Depot's equivalent but much prefer this product. Will likely buy again, there is no substitute for this paper."
5,Excellent game!!!,"This is a top-of-the-line ""Bubble Hockey"" or ""Rod Hockey"" game. Very durable. I have had other cheaper rod hockey games and while they were fun to play, they always broke down after the hard use that we would subject it to. This game is more expensive to purchase, but a better value over time as repairs and replacement of parts is less frequent. And we use it a lot!!!"
5,Great GAme,"Great game. Easy to assemble but be careful, base is hard to fit into some doorways. May need to order the smaller base style. Overall, very pleased with product, directions, and service."
4,Good Even if You got Game,"I don't play as much as I used to, and I certainly don't have time to delve deep into openings. So I got this book to familiarize myself with the wide array of openings without necessarily studying that many in-depth.I'm happy to say it let's you get as deep as you like and covers a lot of ground in a hurry. If you're good enough but want to develop some basic strategies against the myriad of openings you might face, I recommend this book.If nothing else, this book gives you a framework for formulating a game plan no matter what Black's response is."
3,Decent,"Not a bad repertoire book, but why can't opening books be written with more emphasis put on the ideas behind the moves, on what both sides are trying to achieve in the opening? Why the reams of variations that end with ""and white is slightly better""?If you like to play your openings monkey-like ""if black plays A, then white answers with B"", then this book is for you.And as a sidenote, the ""attacking"" openings proposed by Emms are somewhat tame. Why not the Urusov Gambit in the Bishop's Opening against Nf6, or the Austrian Attack against the Pirc?"
4,"great album, very personal","it seems to me that this is a personal album from jets to brazil. they pack in emotional lyrics with sweeping melodies that anyone can enjoy. i wonder though why some of the tracks in the middle made it onto this album, which is why i gave it four stars. give it a listen, i am sure you will enjoy it, especially if you like emo music and the like"
5,The jets do it again!,This album takes my breath away with every listen (the keyboard effects are amazing). Perfecting loneliness compares more with four courned night but has its own style to it as with all of jets to Brazil's releases its long and well worth the money.
2,Outdated,"While nothing in this book is technically wrong, all of the statistics are useless. Since the numbers of college admissions change so quickly, knowing your chances of getting into Yale in 1999 isn't that helpful today. For those who know absolutely nothing about early admissions and must spend money to learn about its basic caveats, then buy this book. Otherwise, one can find helpful, free information on websites like College Confidential, College Board, or The Princeton Review."
4,Very good but not for everyone,"This book is packed with very good, detailed information about colleges' use of early application options, particularly early decision. This book--more like a report--backs up what every good counselor knows: colleges admit applicants early that they may not otherwise admit. But this book is not an admissions process ""how-to"" guide. If you want that, try Allen's ""College Admissions Trade Secrets."" It's a very detailed and sometimes controversial book that reveals much of the same insider information that ""Joining the Elite"" reveals but in a more ""how-to"" format. Buy ""Trade Secrets"" with Princeton Review's ""Best Colleges"" and you'll have just about everything you'll need to tackle this process. Buy ""Joining the Elite"" if you need the fine details and justification for the things that Allen says."
2,Chinese Cooking,This book was a little hard to follow both in content and techniques. All of the recipies are written in both English and Chinese languages which gets a little confusing. These are not what I would call recipies for beginners.
2,not what I expected,I sent this back once I received itand read through itI was looking for basic chinese take out recipesthis one was not
3,Honest attempt but lacking depth,"It's nice to see a whole book devoted to a fundamental but often underestimated subject in ""commercial programming"" like data structures and sorting and searching algorithms. (Ever heard: ""well, let's just use and ArrayList, what else could we do?"" or ""will'll just dump it in a Hastable""). This book gives a very readable and clear overview of the main functionality of the Java Collections APIs and can make a decent introduction for someone just starting out with the language, but is definitely lacking depth and solid and interesting code examples and applications. So, I recommend the book only if you are a newbie to Java and data structures in general. Unfortunately, most of the books on Data Structures in the market will put you off with their pompuous academic style and horrible price, since they are created as textbooks to rip off CS students. A sound, detailed, no bs, up to date, code intensive technical text on the Java collections API is still sorely missing."
4,Just what you need,"The Java Collections are, at the very best, only very briefly covered in most beginner books and even in the more advanced Java books.If you need to employ data structures and algorithms in a professional manner, you'll ned this book. This book explains collections and how and when to use them in-depth and with no ambiguity. The examples are easy to understand and follow. A great book!"
3,Quite Satisfying,"This film held together quite well; it was one of my favorites when I was quite a bit more ignorant of the genre. In retrospect, I would rate it firmly in the middle: some excellent fighting and training scenes, but a tad incoherent at times"
4,"Excellent disc, a greatest hits for this 10 year old band from up north","I have followed these guys for most of the 10 years since they hit the US. I have also seen them live, and this album I have been waiting for for a while. Now I have nicely compiled, great sounding single disc with their best tracks on it. Plus the two new tracks are good as well (kiss on the mouth and better than here demo. This does omit one of their best tracks, and possibly their heaviest, ""Whatever"", and that is the only reason that keeps me from giving this a five star. However, this is very well worth picking up for a first time listener to get an idea why this band should be included in your collection."
4,A Nostalgic Look at some Greatest Hits,"Our Lady Peace is known for unique vocals and stylized lyrics focusing on life and overcoming obstacles set to rock music. Whether you're interested in a sampler platter of their albums or just looking to fill a void from your lost discography (like myself) A Decade will satisfy your cravings for some of their best works, but still leaves a lot of personal favorites still left hiding in the past. While I'd recommend buying each and every album, A Decade is the budget friendly way to go."
4,Read,"Greatest hits are usually disappointing because you never get exactly what you think should be on the compilation. That being said, my interest in this disc was only for the two rare tracks. Which I do feel are very good. It also helps the album is remastered. Over all, very nice."
4,A Good Recap of OLP So Far,"This collection does a pretty good job of assembling most of OLP's best songs together on one disc. However, the two new songs don't stack up to the other tracks and really just distract from the brilliance of the rest of the album. My main complaint would be that there should be more material from the Spiritual Machines album included. How could they leave off Right Behind You (Mafia) or Everyone's A Junkie? Made to Heal is also a standout track from that album that could have made the cut. I completely disagree with the review below which claims that Happiness Is Not A Fish You Can Catch is OLP's best album. For me it's just average when compared to Spiritual Machines or even Gravity. I would also have preferred to have the song Do You Like It from Gravity included. Overall, a good collection with some minor flaws."
5,Awsome!,If you like the american way of hot roddind this pictorial is THE BOOK! it has everything from shops to cars to bonniville.... IT ROCKS
3,SO-SO,"This book has some definite positives, but it's heavy on the (moody) photographs and light on anything else. All b&w and self-conciously ""arty."" As you can see above, 3 stars out of 5."
2,started leaking and finally got disabled after around 2 years of usage,"The machine makes good coffee. We had been maintaining it well, using water filters and cleaning regularly. We also used dry (not oil) coffee beans. However, the machine started leaking after two years of usage and couple of weeks later it got disabled displaying some Fault code #5.Capresso US charges $250 flat fee for the repair, which includes shipping both ways."
5,"Jura F7, is worth the cost!","I have had the Jura F7 for about seven months now and it has been fantastic! I had a few others before, I had to return them however. I wanted a machine that could produce an espresso or any espresso drink such as cappuccino that was as good as the coffee shops. the Jura-Capresso, Impressa F7 did just that. The other few machine's had some issues after just a few months and for what these things cost, I was a bit upset and thank goodness I could return them. The Jura has not let me down at all and I use the machine every day sometimes several times a day without any trouble. If you are ok with spending this type of money for a coffee/espresso machine this is a very good one to get."
4,good....but not great,"Less Than Jake has been one of my favorite bands for a long time but this album just doesn't quite have the ""kick"" that LTJ usually has. With ""Anthem"" they have calmed down in a good way, I just hope they get that amazing energy they had on all their previous records back in their live show, because that is where they are so good."
4,Anthem: a great investment,"I bought this album a couple days ago and can't stop listening to it. I had heard of Less Than Jake, but didn't really know any of their songs. I saw them in concert last month, which kicked... I met them after the show and they're pretty cool. I bought their cd and love it to death. The best songs on there are ghosts of you and me, look what happened, and the last bulb has burned out/screws fall out. Worst songs are welcome to the new south and plastic cup politics. Plastic cup is honestly, a waste of their talent; nevertheless, they're good songs"
3,More Roger,I love this band but I just wish that Roger did most of the singing. He has a way better voice then Chris.
3,really 3.5 stars.,"dont get me wrong, this album rules, but there are WAY LTJ albums. Borders and Boundaries is (in my opinion) the best, followed by hellow rockveiw. but this album, goes a little more pop. Still worth a buy though. and to the kid asking if the rest of the album is as good as ""Thats's why they call it a union"" I would say heck yeah. There are some way better songs than that.Escape from the A-Bomb House is probably my favorite song. Also, LTJ's new album, in with the out crowd is only going to have 6 of 12 tracks have horns! that sucks!"
4,"Definatly still LTJ, but a little different","OK, this cd is not that different from the old stuff. It is still very poppy. It still has a fair amount of horns in it, you just can hear them because they sound so quiet. It is not completely deprived of that really fast sound with ""Best Wishes to Your Black Lung."" I think if it had to be a single genre I would have to call it Pop Punk more than ska. The sound is a little more produced rather than that raw sound they used to have. If you are a long time less than jake fan you will still like it, but not as much as the old stuff. Even though ive been being a little negative it has a few of their best songs ever on it. The science of selling yourself short, best wishes to your black lung, shes gonna break soon, and plastic cup politics are all awsome songs. Overall, i reccomend this to anyone who like Less Than Jake."
3,"Decent, but not what I expected from LTJ.","The music is alright, definately a more ""main stream"" feel to it though. They seem to be really moving away from a ska influence which is too bad. I used to really admire the way they bridged ska and punk."
1,I'm sorry,"I feel bad for anyone that bought this Cd. I feel bad for myself. It is a 13 dollars that I will never get back. There are one or two good songs on this Cd, but they are not like the rest of the CD. Maybe some of you extreme ska fans will like this, but the music just doesn't cut it."
3,anthem,well this is less than jakes worst album i know i love less than jake but this was diffrent i think less than jake was trying to get away from the horns and become just a regluar punk band but it just messed it up they said were trying to get a new sound but newer isnt always better so i give it a 3 i fell guity about giving less than jake a 3 so they should lose the new sound and go back to the old stuff
2,just gotta say something,i just kinda noticed that chris sounds... bad. listen to Look What Happened. the first part sounds like chris is about to crack up at any second. now listen to the borders and boundaries version. he sounds like he actually means what he is saying. Roger is the best singer. he is WAY better than chris. he has an awesome voice. so do the world a favor and go buy a rehasher cd! Every cd before this one is good. (the last three cds in particular)
3,"Lack of horns, but still pretty good","If you don't have an LTJ cd start with ""Hello Rockview"" or ""Borders and Boundries"" then get ""Losing Streak"" or ""Pez Core"" THEN try this one. This cd is LTJ's weakest effort which doesn't mean its bad. ""Welcome to the New South"" is one of their best songs to date. The extreme lack of horns is very disappointing. To me the amazing LTJ horm section of Bud and J.R. is what separates them from the punk rock pack and makes them so good and fun to listen to. The songs on ""Anthem"" tend to be more poppy,some a little too poppy for my liking. The previous 4 CD's i mentioned, i never grew tired of. Already, ""Anthem"" is out of my CD player. I'll probably put it back in a month but it is definately not like previous LTJ CDs that i could listen to over and over. If you are reading this Vinnie, put the horns back in LTJ!!!!"
2,less than interesting,"hmm... has anybody seen the horn section? hello, has anybody heard any of the guitar chords being played on the 1st and 3rd beats? Hmmm? has anyone found the standard LTJ w-oh oh oh's? because anthem seems to be missing them... maybe its only temporary, one day they'll find their roots again. this cd has a lot more punk rock fast paced guitar riffs and less than interesting lyrics. the complete ska-ness that LTJ had so much of in Hello Rockview is now almost completely gone. now, the brass section is more like back-up music when they can't find anything else to play. yuk yuk... a few good songs, many bad songs, too many B-sides, yuk yuk too much filler."
2,LTJ Loses their Ska,"Being a fan of ska from the Toasters to Reel Big Fish, to Bad manners and Less than Jake, I was a bit disappointed in the lack of horns and two tone fun in this album. The title really says it all, they were going for less ska more anthem. It was a dashing of expectations more than a bad album, though I will probably sell it used to someone later down the road.If you are looking for ska go with LTJ's earlier albums, if you want anthems and Blink 182-esque powerrythms, then go with this album."
2,The good ol' days...,"Remember that time you and your best friend went rollerblading, and fell and skinned your knees, but had the best day ever? Remember ska? This is kinda like that."
4,"Catchy Songs, Catchy Songs, Catchy Songs, Catchy Songs!","""Ghosts Of Me And You"" is a catchy song. Possibly the catchiest song on this entire album! You probably only have to listen to a sample of it and you will have it in your head! If you DO intend on listening to this album for a few days straight, then I must warn you that you could get tired of it quickly. But it's worth it, at least. Even if you only think about the band, ""She's Gonna Break Soon"" will get in your head and that will suck. It's packaged better and arranged better than GOODBYE BLUE AND WHITE or White and Blue...either way, this is a little bit better. Beware...of......the title of this review! Ah ha ha ha ha ha! Ah ha ha ha ha ha!! I'M YOUR HOST! THE GHOST HOST WITH THE MOST! I WILL BE WITH YOU UNTIL...THE END! {Actually, this is the end of the review. And I am not crazy...and I'm still with you, so I kept my promise! Also with what I said about the album}."
4,Not as bad as you would think...,"I just got Less Than Jake's Anthem in the mail. (from Amazon, thank you very much). And I really wanted to hate this CD. I was all ready to get on the ""sellout"" bandwagon. But after a listen I can say, it's not bad. I kind of dig it. It's not too punk, not too ska. There's enough of each to give a fan a good listen to. You can definitely hear Warner Bros. slimey fingers attempting to corrupt our poor boys. But I think Less Thank Jake held pretty strong, it's not ""Hello Rockview"" but it's not ""Boarders and Boundaries"". It's surprisingly good."
3,It was OK,"I've been listening to LTJ for years now, and to tell you the truth i think this album is far from their best work. I think the group is still on the rebound from their long retreat, but w/ a bit of work they could be back to the old glory days of ""Pezcore"" and ""Hello Rockview"". The majority of the songs lack the old LTJ of funny lyrics, blaring horns, and queer guitar riffs. Even the ""hit"" single, She's Gonna Break Soon, isn't that riveting. But the CD does have some classic LTJ, and thats what made it worth buying, at least for me."
2,LTJ,I was a huge LTJ fan. They sold out with this album. I think it all began after they toured with the kings of pathetic punk and selling out (Good Charlotte and New Found Glory). The record company mixed it horribly and hid all the horns in the back. She's gonna break soon is a disgrace to everything LTJ is. I hope this isnt the end of them...
1,Horrible!!!,"I have been an avid LTJ listener for years and have always believed their music to have an enjoyable and unique quality. . .Now I hear ANTHEM. . .The uniqueness as well as ability to be enjoyed has left their music undoubtfully.First, LTJ's pride and joy used to be their hornsSecond, Their is already an infinite number of pop-punk bands out there, why did LTJ have to become one?I can't continue writing this. . .It is so sad, buy LOSING STREAK if anything."
3,ADDICTION,"wow.. I wouldnt recommend the entire album but Ghosts of Me and You it truly an incredible song.. its powerful, soothing, and touches on a very real concept for anyone who can't be together anymore, living in different parts of the country. The song could stand on its own to be a great sell, but it also appeared on NHL 2004, so fans of that series and compilations of bands will find this band, or at least this song especially endeared to them. Maybe the rest of the LTJ songs on the album will grow on me and I'll actually go buy the CD, but until then it is an absolute ADDICTION with Ghosts of Me and You! Give it a listen and you'll know exactly what I'm talkin' about.. laaater..J."
3,"Less Than Jake ""Anthem""","""Welcome To The New South"" 3/5""Ghosts Of You And Me"" 3/5""Look What Happened"" 5/5""The Science Of Selling Yourself Short"" 5/5""Short Fuse Burning"" 4/5""Motown Never Sounded So Good"" 3/5""The Upwards War And Downturned Cycle"" 3/5""Escape From The A-Bomb House"" 3/5""Best Wishes To Your Black Lungs"" 3/5""She's Gonna Break Soon"" 4/5""That's Why They Call It A Union"" 3/5""Plastic Cup Politics"" 4/5""The Brightest Bulb Has Burned Out/Screws Fall Out"" 4/5""Surrender"" 5/5On their latest album, Less Than Jake have turned away their punk ear to their pop ear, with mixed results. Though the album is not bad, it's not amazing either. Some standouts include ""Look What Happened"" ""The Science Of Selling Yourself Short"" and the awesome Cheap Trick cover ""Surrender.""Overall rating: Three and a half stars."
5,Anthem for a new generation!,"Now that they moved away from the ska scene, Less Than Jake is back with one of thier best CD's ever! A must hvae for any music fan! Not one weak song on the whole album!"
2,2 or 3 good songs in the bunch,"the best song on this CD is a cover. That's a bad sign. Not only that, but its only available on the ""special edition"" CD, not the normal CD (i think). I was supsicious of it when I looked at who they were on (i was hoping still with Fat) but they had gone to uber-corporate Warner Bros. Unfortunately their sound reflects that. They have effectively killed their horn section. When they do play, they usually are buried under guitars. ""she's gonna break soon"" has to be the worst of the bunch. Just annoying. ""Plastic Cup Politics"" is the closest they get to manic fun, and even that is shaky. You can see the lyrics coming from miles away, if you heard Hello Rockview, so there's nothing to engage your brain. I bought it for the Tshirt packaged with it. That hasn't let me down yet."
3,"a disappointment, but it's not terrible","anthem was an ok cd. as an album overall its good, but coming from LTJ it's a disappointment. if you want to listen to the LTJ that got me hooked on ska check out any of their other cds. this cd also had some radio hits on it and even though ltj didnt sell out, if some of their songs got on the radio then they made a mistake. lets face it, radio music sucks.so if you're more into pop/punk then ska, then check this out. if you got into LTJ because you liked their old ska stuff, dont entirely avoid this but buy their other cds first.so it's not a waste of time/money to listen to anthem but if you like LTJ cause you love the radio and crappy music thats on the radio (pop/punk and emo), then you got into LTJ for the wrong reason.bottom line, check out their other stuff before purchasing this."
1,nah,"this is a good example of a good band gone way wrong. LTJ was my favorite band and will probably remain so, as long as i dont hear anymore of the songs from this cd. They are not ska or punk rock at all, but nothing more than sell outs, johnny quest was right i guess. If you liked the old LTJ, such as pezcore and hello rockview, you dont want this cd. It is nothing like the way they used to be. It could even be called terrible. Definately not a step in the right direction."
4,Let's get the facts straight,"First of all, lower gauge wire translates to higher load bearing capacity, i.e., the lower the gauge, the better.Second, this baby may throw bone dry snow 30 feet in a favorable breeze, but you'll be lucky to get wet snow more than six.Third, this model does a one easy pass job on 10 inches of snow, but if you have more than 50 feet of driveway to do, you'll probably want more power for heavier snowfalls.Fourth, it will handle slush, but it won't break solid ice. If you try to make it, you'll probably break it."
3,follow up stopped working,"just a followup from previous review. Machine stopped working, motor checked out okay. I left the motor housing off and motor dry out; started working. Someone commented the motor/ motor housing was susceptible to water infiltration. That very well could have been my problem - snow everwhere fighting a 10 inch snow driveway. Will try to see if can plug up any obvious motor housing holes without having the motor get hot."
1,"Love the design, hate the spare parts policies","I love this snowblower except -- when I lost the key, and got a new key mailed to me, I found that it did not fit. THis was because the current version of this mower uses a different key. Whichever horrible ""executive"" decided to change the key design deserves to be demoted to mailroom clerk."
5,Toro 1800 is still the winner,"I've noticed a lot of the reviews are from a few years back, and thought I'd add my two cents.I got this contraption last year (2006) after I was tired of constantly shoveling my driveway. We had several snow storms dumping at least 6 inches of snow at a time. Of course once I got it, we didn't get but 2 inches! It blasted the 2 inches like it was nothing; I didn't get a chance to really test it until this year. 6 inches of snow cleared with no problems! A very nice feature on this unit is the crank'n aim snow chute. Some other models in it's price range only gives you the option to throw the snow straight forward. Being about to easily shift the chute make doing 200ft driveway a breeze. 200ft, yup that's one long extension cord... Happy Snow Blowin!"
5,snow blower,"Since my husband had been layed up this winter, we purchased the electric snow blower for me to use. Electric was our best bet because we don't have a garage, and could store the blower in our sun room. It worked great even after the record snow we got in the Syracuse area this year."
1,do not buy this,Not worth it. Broke twice the first two times I used it. First the belt broke and then the belt and the pulley. Had to take it to a Toro dealer to get fixed but it still does not do a good job and is useless even in only a few inches of snow. It is very flimsy and not well made. I expected more from Toro.
1,Pure Junk,"Purchased this thru Ace Hardware so I have a place to return it to and have repaired. I used it for 20 minutes before it quit working in a very soft , light snow. I had been reading the reviews and thought the belt was slipping but, I found out two the plastic nipples on one of the gears broke off. He had to order this and said it was very common for the Toro 1800. I will give it one more try and then trade up at Ace. In the meantime, the snow melted faster then Governor Blagojevich's approval rating."
5,great snowblower,"Received it this week. We have snow like we haven't had for many years and it just keeps coming. I screwed up my back and can't keep shoveling. I have a 12 ft. by 30 level driveway and some sidewalk to do. This is perfect for me. I am impressed with the ease of use and light weight. As for the minor assembly, I used a small flat blade screwdriver to press the electric cable when aligning the handle holes. I did the assembly myself, but does require patience and following the directions and maybe 1/2 hour. It clears the snow down to bare surface. It will do slush, just won't throw it far because ithe slush is too heavy. Worth every penny and I will help my elderly neighbors."
5,Great!,"We bought this last year, and only used it once or twice. But it has snowed three times in the last week and I can now honestly say it rocks!The first lot of snow was wet - no problems going through 3"" of heavy wet snow. Still threw the snow clear of the driveway (it even went through the remaining snow the following day that had a layer of ice on top).We then got 7"" of light fluffy snow - no problem at all. Our driveway is steep and so a heavy gas powered snow thrower would be impossible. But this is so lightweight that even with a layer of ice I was able to pull it back up the driveway. I cannot recommend this highly enough."
1,Broke the first time I used it,"I purchased this product and assembled it well before our first snow. Last night it snowed approximately one inch, and on the second or third trip down the driveway the blades stopped spinning and would not start again. I'm going to try to get it repaired under warranty or get my money back, but I'm quite disappointed."
1,First Impression Not Positive,"The first time (15 minutes) I used the blower on a 2 inch wet snow fall the belt slipped off.... I could smell the rubber from the belt.... The belt was damaged but still usable. I referred to the owner's manual and reinstalled the damaged belt and completed the job. I called customer service the next day and they said I quote ""it happens all the time""..... I had to order another belt (I paid $16.99)........ I haven't had the opportunity to use the blower again.... No snow fall!!Needless to say my first impression of the blower is not very good. Toro should had sent me another belt free of charge."
4,"Johnstown Snowstorm 28""","We're two days removed from 'Snowmagedon'. Johnstown ended up with 28"". There's no way I could have taken care of my driveway with a shovel.Although the snow was higher than the unit itself, I was amazed how well it was able to throw the snow.Don't let the weight fool you, it's more powerful than it looks.It was a birthday gift from my mother. Thanks Mom and thanks Toro!"
5,Performs as expected...,"Performs as expected. Trouble with heavy snow. Cleared 15"" of fresh snow just yesterday. The only problem is the power cord. Have to figure out a good way to wind and store the cord."
1,Buy it if you live in Florida,"Whoever designed this never ever assembled one! Fitting the handle is very difficult (too tight) and the screws for the snow-hood don't fit into their slots!Not very strong. Only good for 4-5 inches of snow. Main advantage is that you don't need gas, but do need a long cord (not included). If you get a lot of snow, buy a stronger snow thrower."
3,Remove all obstacles,"There's not much to add to what has already been mentioned but I'll confirm the need to make sure your sidewalks are free of rocks, gravel, twigs and branches before that first substantial snowfall. If any of those gets into the works, you will be replacing the timing belt. FYI, that's Part #73-0160 since you WILL be ordering one; I'm on my third. A $14 part + $10 shipping, if you're lucky."
1,Broke after less than an hour.,"I purchased the 1800 Power Curve for my husband as a Christmas 2009 gift. After 45 minutes of use on a flat driveway, the unit stopped working. It was taken to a authorized Toro repair shop. They advised that a belt had broken. The snow being thrown when the unit broke was powdery, not wet. While the unit was working it did a good job clearing the snow to bare concrete. The unit has been in the shop for eleven days and they still have not received the belt from Toro. I would not recommend this product till Toro addresses the belt problem."
2,"not easy to assemble, handle not safe, electric cord tangled","It is the first day I used it. I put it together last night. It only required four screws, but not easy to do. The instruction did not say which tools to use. There are two moving parts to tighten one screw and locknut. I had a hard time to find right tools to hold one in place, which tightened the other.The primary handle has the switch, very unsafe. I tried to remove electric cord under the snow blower, but touched the handle/switch inadvertently, the cord was tangled and I could not remove it. I guess I have to cut the cord and buy new one. What a pain."
1,Shockingly bad customer service,"I bought this product about two years ago.But it looked like there was a short-circuit insideand It stopped working.Since it was still under the warranty,I called Toro's customer service. One lady talkedwith me and let me bring it to a service dealer.However, when I asked her to provide some detailson things like what options I could get if it isnot repairable. She refused to give details and justsaid she was not authorized to give a permissionon repairing over the phone. However, I told herI just wanted more details on warranties and I didn'texpect her to give any permission on repairing.She became very impatient. She refused to give me her nameand simply hung up. This was the worst customer serviceexperience I ever had."
1,VERY LIGHT DUTY,"I bought this to do just the cement walks, but the holes for the bolts were not drilled & the rotor bar made a scraping noise that was not normal.It is all plastic even the rotor bar, rubber is best.For the price I recommend a shovel or spend the extra money and buy heavier duty snow blower. Sent it back within two hours after it arrived.Never used it in snow."
1,Horrible! Don't buy!,"After 2 seasons of minor usage, the belt on the left side came off and worn out. The customer service representative said the unit was designed for light snow and they don't take any responsibility of it. Yes, I always used it with light snow of 4 or 5 inches. How lighter do they prefer? I'm very disappointed!"
4,"Toro 18"" Snow Blower #38025",Very good...it arrived just after a big snow storm and did exactly what we needed it for. Your service was fantastic! Unbelievably fast and the shipping cost was perfect.
5,Snow Thrower,"I have not yet used it, but it was pretty easy to put together, and it looks like it will work well and will be fun to use."
2,NO SNOW!!,"we have not had any snow in New England yet, this snowless year.The handle was difficult assemble but other than that it was fairly easy.I am anxious to try the unit after a snowfall."
2,Seems like a cheap toy,"We went to the local hardware store to look at and perhaps purchase one of these. I have to say that I was very disappointed in its robustness and appearance in general. It looks and feels like a cheap plastic toy with an expensive price tag. The plastic impeller (yes, the impeller is plastic) looked like something that would disintegrate into pieces the first time it hit a piece of ice. We decided not to buy one.I give it two stars because we haven't actually used it and so I don't have a basis to give it one star.At the very least, I would advise against buying one of these by mail order or over the Internet (sorry, Amazon) unless you know exactly what you are buying. Find one in a local hardware store (the toro website has MANY dealer listings all over the country) and go look at it first. Then decide if it's worth $300+ to you."
1,End This Fantasy Now!,"If your snowblower will not handle the biggest, baddest drift left by the plow, or the worst snowstorm of the winter, it is worthless! Here in Minnesnowcold, where winter is the best 7 months of the year, nothing less than an 8hp, two-stage snowthrower is worth your money. The bad news is you will need to spend $800 to $1200, the good news is it should last 20+ years. A serious snowblower will handle the big jobs (that's why you bought it) and also make short work of those annoyance value snowfalls. Toro is a great company that makes serious snowblowers (I own one!) but an electric snow thrower is like using a 2"" paring knife to slice watermelon--sure you can do it, but once you try the 8"" slicer, why would you bother?"
3,Works well but delicate,"The first time I used the blower it worked amazingly well, for about 30 minutes. Then I got a piece of ice stuck in it. I quickly stopped the blade but it was too late, the belt was ruined.It turns out that for 300 plus dollars, you don't get a torque limiter or shear pins so the motor turns until your release the switch or the belt breaks. The trick is to stop the unit immediately if it stops throwing snow. That's important because the belt is about $25 and you can only get it at a Toro dealer or parts warehouse. It is supposed to be made out of Kevlar but if it is, the it is a very thin grade Kevlar.I expect that with enough diligence, I can make the belt last a year, this is the second year for the blower so we'll see.Don't use this blower if the snow is heavy and wet or around ice formations."
5,Snow blowin frenzy,This little machine is amazing.It works really well even through deep snow!I use mine on are front walk and back deck.It will hog through 10-12 inches of snow powder or wet!I love mine!
4,Works Great!,Due to being electric I was a little hesitate about purchasing this but boy am I glad I did. I have used it twice at my house and my son's house during the recent snows. I was quite surprised at how it clears the snow and it is fast. I read the other reviews about tying the cord and using it like a vacuum cleaner so I did not have any problems. Putting the handle on was a little difficult due to the electric cord on the right side facing the unit. I just had to force it. Other than that I have no complaints.
4,Awesome Snow Thrower,"This is one heck of a snow thrower. Picked it up at Ace Hardware for $299 (the MSRP for it is $329.99 - the company selling them on here should be ashamed of themselves for gauging the price and charging $60 above MSRP AND charging an additional $20 for shipping!). For a little thing, it's quite steady and sturdy and it clears the driveway quite quickly. Highly recommended if you can find them elsewhere."
4,Works as advertised,Good machine for removing average amounts of snow. Cleaning up after a blizard or snow that has turned icy is more challenging.
3,Toro snow Blower,"I recently used this product in the last snow storm we had here in PA. It contained snow, sleet, and ice as well as freezing rain. It was a good time to see what this machine can do in those conditions.The snow mixture reached a height of approximately 10 inches plus. In using this product I found that it made my job a lot easier. So easy that my girlfriend utilized it in a trial run and was successsul in using it.The liked the snow range that was shot from the blower as well as the directional function of the snow shoot. However, I found myself raking the snow 2-3 times in order to pick the snow up off the ground. In addition, the shovel plate on this product did not do well with picking up or removing the ice. I had to manually chip the ice away with an ice pick for the machine to pick the ice up. There was no problem after that.In all I think this is a good machine for quick jobs on smaller sections of land."
1,Risky purchase,"I decided to give this snowblower a shot since there were a lot more positive reviews than negative. Not a good idea. Obviously a lot of people have had good experiences with it, but at least read the negative reviews in more detail before making up your mind.It seems that a lot of the people who don't like it have had the same problem. The belt won't stay on in even light snow and tightening parts to try and solve the problem on your own seems a little bit like sticking your finger in the hole to stop the dam from bursting. The problem will probably come back or something worse will happen.It sounds like about 1/5 of these are lemons, so if you like those odds, go for it. Just be prepared if you're that unlucky one like I was. It makes shoveling for an hour and a half even more agravating when you thought you weren't going to have to anymore."
4,Yep...It Clears Snow,"I still haven't been able to get the holes properly lined up so I can install the crossbar with the crank for the exhaulst nozzle. Although annoying, that doesn't affect the machine's operation. It smoothly clears up to about 10"". Anything deeper will require a second pass. Operating this is a lot more fun than operating a shovel."
1,more than 2 inches of snow-don't buy,"I am extremely dissapointed with the Toro 1800. I can't believe I paid $300 for this cheap piece of plastic. I only used it 4 or 5 times before the belt broke, and I wasn't even using it in very deep snow. I took it to a Toro repair shop, and they couldn't even fix it because the new belt would just keep falling off. I finally had to trade it in and ended up having to get a higher end machine, and Toro ripped me off on the trade in and didn't even give me full value for the trade in. If you don't ever get more than a couple inches of snow, then this maybe would work okay, but beware, mine broke when I was shoveling probably 3 or 4 inches of snow. I really hope my new Toro snow blower works better, if not, I am going to be done with Toro for good."
3,GREAT . . .for one season.,"We used the snow thrower for 3 months last winter and loved it. This year, first snowfall - fine.Second snowfall - fourth month - it starts, but the blade won't turn :( To the repair shop too soon!!!"
3,slow start,"Right out of the box it would not throw snow. I'm not sure why it didn't work staight from the factory?Called the warranty hot line . They instructed me to check the belts. I did and found the left side belt was off. So, back out into the snow and the belt came off instantly.The belt jumped off once more time and on the third try it worked fine.I'm getting good and taking it apart and putting it back togeather.Good news is it hasn't come off again.It's a little slugish on wet snow but that's to be expexted. It never stalled even in deep snow.In a small snow fall it's quick. In heavy snow that first pass is a bear but once you get it done you can take smaller passes and then it's faster.This is not self propelled so be prepared to use some muscle on that heavy stuff. I'm glad I had it this winter."
1,"Please do not buy this equipment. If you want, I will give you mine.","I really do not understand why some people give this snow thrower a 5 stars. It does not work at all. I know this is not a heavy duty snow thrower, I went out to use it before the snow gets too deep. It turn on, and I was ready. But guess what, it did for less than 5 seconds, then quit. I tried again, the same thing happen. After many attempts, I gave up, I manually did the drive way for less than 1 hour. The snow was light and fuffy, what is the problem with this snow thrower.If you wish to take this off my hand, you are welcome to pick it up."
2,A fragile machine,"I used Toto 1800 for two snow days so far. The first was 6"" snow and the second is 3"" snow. I was very careful not to over load the machine by running it in V pattern on the driveway and each path load only 1/3 to 1/2 of the snow.The first snow day, the driving belt slipped off on the first start after I stopped the machine to clean the snow on my cars (strang isn't it). I have to reinstall the belt. The second snow day, the machine lost its power. Upon opening the cover, I saw part of the driving belt is torned and stuck between the wheel and the casing. The timing belf is visibly torned but still functional.I don't mind fixing it every time I use it since I am handy. But at that rate how long can it last ?I am ordering the belts in anticipation of the day the belts break."
5,Snowblower,"The little snowblower came in just a couple of days before the ""big snow."" It snowed 58 inches in that one storm, much more than we usually have. Not only did the snowblower clear the decks which is what I bought it for but, with a lot of patience, cleared a very large driveway. And that was good because there was so much snow the snowplows couldn't get to us for two days."
3,Speculation,"I, of course, cannot use this product until it snows in my location. I bought it on the recommendaation of a friend who has one like it."
1,PARTS NOT INCLUDED,"NO PARTSNO SCREWSDID I MENTION THAT THERE WERE NO PARTSHOW DO YOU PUT IT TOGETHER WITHOUT THOSE LITTLE SCREWS, NUTS AND BOLTS?WHERE IS THEIR QUALITY CONTROL?"
1,One star is too high a rating,This machine? is total junk would not blow fake snow if my life depended on it.
4,Toro 1800 Electric Curve Snow Thrower,"If you do not have a lot of driveway and sidewalk, this is a good snow thrower to have. It works well. You don't have to deal with gasoline. Be sure you have enough electric cable. If you have to connect one or more cables together, it might be a good idea to tape them together so they do not separate. It is not heavy, so it is easy to move around. I like it."
5,Pleased Mainer,"I really like this snow thrower. I am a 40yr old female who has to take care of my home by myself and works 40+ hrs a week. I needed something that would put no stress on my back and get the job done fast. I wanted it for my large deck and walkway. This works great, the day I used it for the first time, the snow was actually heavy and I thought that would be a problem but it cut right through it. I just postition the shoot where I wanted the snow to go and it blew it right off the deck.UPDATE: February 26,2011Just finished using my snow thrower and I can not believe how much this little thing throws the snow, especially after the winter we have had here in Maine this year. We just got another foot last night. I have used this for almost two years now and it has really performed excellent !"
4,Five inches of wet snow in Minneapolis - no problem,"I have three properties to clear in South Minneapolis so I needed a blower that I could toss in the van and transport to each location. I highly recommend it! It clears snow as well as the old 3.5 hp two-stage I owned a years ago. Clearly this machine will not clear a 3-foot snow pile pushed up by a snow plow. However, it DOES a great job of wet heavy snow. I was trowing this soggy stuff at least 20 feet. The construction is sound and time will tell if it will hold up."
4,It's a keeper,"Hey,Two things to remember- it's electric and it has limitations due to size. Be patient and persistent and this product will work. I just cleared snow that was over 18 inches deep from my large deck and cleared a 200 square foot area on my lawn out back for my pet to do her business. It worked well.However, I did have one problem at first. The belt kept slipping off. Very frustrating! I was ready to return it when I tried one more thing. I turned the spring that connects to the large belt tensioner over and reattached it ""upside down."" It worked! Evidently, the factory assembled the product with the spring upside down and I ended up turning it right side up for the proper amount of tension to keep the belt on.Another tip. Don't disconnect the spring to the large belt just to get the large belt on and off. Just hold the belt tensioner where it releases tension on the belt. It's a pain getting the spring on and off otherwise."
2,works good but assembled wrong from factory,"Like many other people with this snowblower, I ended up having a problem with the belt coming off. The snowblower worked fine for one storm, the enxt storm it stopped working. I put the belt back on because it came off and it immediately came off again.After reading the discussion here I found that the large bolt that goes from the right side through the center of the rotor to the pulley on the left side was very loose. This caused the left pulley to be out of alignment with the other pulleys and caused the belt to come off. I ended up having to pull the cover off on the right side of the snowblower and tightening the large bolt that holds the rotor. It was sooo loose that I could turn it by hand.When the snowblower worked, it seemed to work pretty well. It seems to do fine in snow at aobut 8 inches and has trouble with stuff that is deeper. So I recommend going out and blowing often so you don't have a problem."
4,Not Bad,"There are a couple of things I'm not crazy about with this snowblower - the ""on"" lever is too wide so you land up turning it on accidentally when pulling it backwards; and there should be a better device to adjust the angle of the chute....currently you have to use wrenches to adjust it. That being said, it works great. Had a 10"" snowfall today and I was truly glad to have this snowblower."
1,Nope -- don't bother,"If you're only doing a deck and have an hour or so, go for it. But if you're trying to do a driveway with a 100' extension think again. I used it once (on the driveway) and it stopped after two 40-foot passes in 3-inch snow. It was still under warranty; the local outdoor power equipment retailer did the needed repairs and there was no more snow that year (speaks well of Toro and Amazon warranties). However, the year after, I tested it and it worked great. Did the required maintenance checks; also great. Snow fell; I plugged it in and spark came out the handle. I spent 5 hours shoveling. I would not buy again."
3,Good for a small driveway,Good for a small driveway. Dont buy this if you have a big driveway more than 2 to 3 plus car capacity. I could not use this in the recent Noreaster in NY because we lost power. Also for big driveways an electric with wire connected is not easy to handle. I got a gas snow thrower instead this year.
4,Not bad for an electric,"For an electric powered snowblower this machine does a pretty decent job. Granted it could never compare to a gas powered machine but it is very useful. We live in West Michigan and get a lot of lake-effect snow showers. This machine will take on snow up to 10 inches deep. It works best on ""dry"" snow but will work on ""wet"" snow also - it just wont throw it as far. For where we live I use it mostly for quick maintenance or touch up clearing of snow and for sidewalks and other areas that the snowplow can't get to.PROS: No mixing of oil and gas, small and convenient.CONS: cord management."
4,Great Snow Blower,"Just used this to blow 3 inches of very wet and heavy snow in Chicago area. Worked unexpectedly very well. I completed my driveway, my sidewalks and my neighbor's sidewalks in 20 minutes flat. It usually takes me at least 40 minutes just to do the driveway.As many reviewers stated, the chute did move a bit in heavy/wet snow condition. I had to correct the chute direction once in a while, not a big deal.Cable is a little bit of inconvenience, but I am glad with my purchase after I saw my neighbor who just purchased a brand new gas powered snow blower had to restart his so many times because it could not handle the wet snow. He finally finished in about 50 minutes and my driveway is still cleaner than his :)"
4,Electric snowblower,"We ordered this online when there were no snowblowers available all over town after the blizzards in December '06. Took awhile to arrive because the delivery trucks couldn't make it into residential neighborhoods, but once we got it, it was easy to assemble and even easier to use.The wheels are small, but that hasn't presented much of a problem. It does a great job on fresh powder, not as effective on icier areas, but all in all, totally worth the investment and doesn't take much time. Infinitely better than shoveling by hand for hours!"
5,Does the Job,Delivery was much faster than expected. This is more heavy duty than a power shovel and just below a regular full size snow blower. Bought it for my daughter and she is able to handle it very well in up to about a foot of snow. It is not a gas powered self-propelled blower so it will take time to clear the snow but is ideal for people who can't handle a regular blower
4,very effective small blower,"Toro has done their homework with this snow thrower. I have a pretty large driveway and I can clear a 3-4"" snowfall with it in about 45 minutes, very powerful for its size. It is very convenient as it is lubricated for life and requires very little maintenance. I just plug it in and go. It does require a quick look to be sure nothing is caught up in the snout or the chute (sticks for instance). The only negative comment I can make is, well it has a cord. It is best to follow the instructions for snow blowing in the manual and be sure to blow so the cord lays out behind you or beside you on the house outlet side. It would be easy to get the cord caught up in the snout if not careful."
5,Awesome Little Machine!,"This little snow blower is very powerful and very lightweight to handle. The advertisements say that this snow blower can throw the snow up to 30 feet and they are not joking. I was snow blowing my driveway and I had to stop because I was throwing the snow across the street and into the field which is about almost 40 feet from my driveway. I was shocked that this little machine could throw it that far.A slight down side is that it does not have a drive wheel so it gets caught on the ground while you are pushing it. Not such a big deal though.This snow blower is ideal for the small area like a small driveway or a deck. I would not recommend this snowblower for the larger jobs though. It is fast, but you would end up getting tired fast by pushing it since it does not have a drive wheel.All-in-all, this is a great machine for the ease of use, easy assembly and a great price tag."
4,Great Little Snow Mover - No Fumes!,"If you're like me and don't want to deal with a gas motor - mixing gas, smelling like fumes - then this is the blower for you! I just cleared 12"" of snow from my double-wide driveway in 15 minutes. No problem. It scrapes the pavement clean, much more than other blowers. Sure it takes some maneuvering of the cord, but once you get a routine you won't even notice. If I had loads of long sidewalks maybe staying tethered to a cord would be annoying, but you can't beat this blower for clearing a long driveway quickly, cleanly, and efficiently."
4,Tiny but powerful,"As a Wisconsin resident that has always used a shovel, I finally decided to get a snow thrower this year. I am not handy with machines, and don't have gas hanging around in my garage, so an electric was perfect.This product does a great job for its size. It is not as powerful as those large gas powered ones, but I can easily clear my driveway with this, and it is light enough my wife carries it through the house to do the back porch (something my neighbor can't do with his big rig).It is powerful, but will not handle what the city plow leaves at the base of the driveway. You can hit that in layers if it is thick, but it stil works. We have had 40"" of snow so far this year, and I am very happy with the purchase."
3,Perfect for single-car driveway,"Assembly required. Perfect for removing a couple of inches of snow on a single-car driveway. Very easy to use. For best results, use it before you walk or drive over the snow and pack it down."
1,not so great,"after using the toro for a while, i received a house gift from a friend called the SNOW JOE. it is totally amazing. puts the toro to shame. its lighter , faster and much easier to use."
2,Don't bother ...,"When I first got this snowblower I thought it was a piece of cr*p ... but now I've had it for a few years and I KNOW that it's a piece of cr*p. I think the problem is in the design. The wheels are too small to be useful. You end up just ""shoving"" the snow blower down the driveway. If you watch the video demo you can see that the wheels are up off the ground. It just seems weird to me.It definitely does throw the snow ... and it's decent in a small snow ... but if it's a small snow it's not that hard to shovel it.During the first winter I had it it stopped working. I took it to a repair place and learned that the auger stopped working. I paid to replace it ($180) thinking that maybe it would work better after that. Nope ... still the same crummy snowblower."
2,Dense Snow Defeats the Toro,"I loved the Toro snow blower all last year when we had 6 inches or so of fluffy snow. Today we got 10 inches of dense wet snow. The Toro did great for the first 20 minutes, then began sounding like there was a twig stuck in the machine. I checked. No twig. Two minutes later it gave out. The engine still worked, but the internal gears, which must be plastic, were stripped. It would catch, then stop half way around. Bummer. Now I'll either have to try to have my son-in-law repair it or buy a new machine."
3,Toro Electric works great after warrenty work,"As received, the snowblower quit after the first 50 feet of use. Bolts had not been torqued adequately as built. This caused belt to jump pulley. Took local warrenty repair facility 4 days to figure this out. Worked great after they torqued the bolts. They had a second one returned (same problem and also bought from Amazon.com) the day I picked mine up. Worked great in our recent 8 inch snow. It did double drive plus sidewalks in about 30 minutes. Cord is not a problem."
3,Happy until it died before the blizzards hit,"This little fella gave up the ghost the snow before the two blizzards rolled through town. It was on it's third winter. I probably would have given it 4.5 stars if it had lasted longer. My two issues would have to be durablility and also difficulty using it on uneven surfaces. My driveway is old and cracked, and the blower would often get stuck on the cracks. So if you have a nice smooth driveway, this thing does a great job. For a couple of years, anyway."
1,Do not purchase toro 1800,"I recently purchased the 1800 power thrower from Amazon.I kept it in the box for 30 days before I opened it on the first snow storm of the season. The snow thrower moved about six feet of 3 inch snow very well, then it died. The drive belt was destroyed by the unit. Toro service policy is the worst I have ever seen. Toro supplied me with an independent service shop in my area. The only trouble is that they don't work on electric snow throwers. Toro then said I could mail the unit back to them at my expense. Lessons learned..buy local and don't buy from Toro. I wasted $299."
3,Motor blown within one year,"We love the way this blower is light and easy to use and no messy gas to keep around the house.However, the motor blew out within a year after being used less that 20 times. It was still under warranty and Toro is sending a replacement."
5,"Got it in 2006, still going strong in 2013!","We just got 18-20 inches of snow in Rhode Island and I was able to blow us out. It took a few runs and it went a little slow, but it did the job. I love this blower.UPDATE: We are having SOOOOOOO much snow this year (2011). I've had it since 2006 and it does the job!Update 2013: This thing just goes and goes."
4,It can really throw it,I'm most happy with my thrower it works as advertised. I had no problem with deep snow taller than the thrower it chews it down to size. Love it
4,Good Choice,"Well, it took about a month of no snow before I was able to test my new snow thrower. We finally got about 9"" of fairly heavy snow this past weekend so I was able to give it a good work out. The machine performed great. I had no problem getting thru the 9"" of snow. It is a little slow going with this much snow but it still ate it up. Didn't throw it as far as the ad claims but it was far enough. The light weight made it easy for me to carry it to different areas that needed snow removal. The only draw back is that it is electric and you always have to be aware of the cord. Definitely get a heavy duty cold weather extension cord. The machine is worth the money just for the saved back strain alone. Cut the work time in half.Dave P."
1,Stopped Working After the First Use,"I used this on my average size driveway while the snow was just a couple of inches. It worked great the first time I used it, but during a second snow storm, the motor started smoking. I opened the side panel and could see the belt was off its track. I had to take it to an authorized Toro dealer and repair store who contacted the Toro company and informed them that the motor was inoperable. The Toro company decided to send me a new machine which I am supposed to receive sometime in August or September, 2010. We'll see what happens. Overall, I do not feel this snow thrower is reliable and was disappointed with not being able to get any reasonable use out of it. I am probably better off buying a small gas snow thrower for next season."
4,Good for moderate snowfall areas,"I have used it 5 or 6 times now in varying amounts and types of snow, and am well satisfied. I find it capable of efficiently removing up to about 8"" of average weight snow and 5 inches of wet heavy snow. It occasionally plugs with heavy snow but can be quickly unplugged just by stopping the motor and pushing the plug down into the chamber. It is adequately powerful, and I find it generally easy to push into the snow--the wheels aren't a problem for me. I would recommend it for driveways and sidewalks up to at least 1200 square feet, where it meets most of my coastal Mid-Atlantic area needs."
4,Great for short people only,"I live in upstate NY, and I pay to have my driveway cleared professionally. I bought the Toro 1800 Power Curve just to clear the sidewalks and patio. It works amazingly well for that task. My only criticism--and it's a serious one for me--is that the handle is much too low. I'm only 6' tall, but I have to bend over almost 90 degrees to operate the thing properly. Bending over so far while walking is very hard on my back, so I put the Toro in the garage and went back to a shovel and broom. I'll probably try to sell it on eBay, making clear that bidders should be under about 5'4"". An adjustable-height handle would have made this a perfect light-duty snow blower. Too bad."
4,Great Blower for Smaller Jobs,"We received 6-8"" of snow last night. I didn't measure my drive but it was a good amount. This blower ate right through it and kept on going. I made the mistake of flinging large amounts of the snow on areas that I needed to blow (up to about a foot) and that slowed the the blower down a bit but it did get through it. I have a 3 car drive way and this blower worked great, did the entire thing plus the sidewalks. The only annoying part is having to deal with the cord, but such is life with most electric power items and I don't have to buy gas, oil or do any sort of mixing/maintenance associated with a gas blower.As long as you're getting less than 12"" of snow at a time I'd highly recommend this blower to you. Otherwise you either have to blow more often or you should get a larger blower."
1,Not Worth the Trouble,"I wish I could say that the Toro 1800 was the answer to our snow removal problems, but unfortunately I can't. In fact, I can't even see how it works. The throat of the carriage bolts that are supposed to connect the discharge chute to the chute deflector are too big for the holes in the discharge chute. Because of this, it's impossible to tighten the bolts. I contacted Toro about this problem and they sent new bolts that were exactly the same size as the first set. Guess what: Those did't fit either (of course)! So I called the company again. The rep suggested that I remove the discharge chute by loosening the two bolts on the chute that hold it on. There are no bolts on top of the chute. The show thrower is going back to the dealer in the morning. What a waste of time..."
4,Good Value for the Money,"This is a very good value for the price. It obviously won't be as good as a full-size gasoline-powered snow blower, but most of us don't really need that. This thrower is light (mine is hanging on a hook on the wall of my garage), maneuverable, starts right up with the touch of a button, doesn't need gas or oil, and does the job well. It cleans right down to the pavement, which is surprising, but it does it. It didn't throw my snow thirty feet, or anywhere close to thirty feet. I guess, to an extent, it depends on what kind of snow you are trying to clear, but I used mine for two different snow falls, and I'd say mine maxed out at around ten feet, but that was all I needed. This makes clearing the driveway sort of like vacuuming. For one of the snows, which was very wet, the chute clogged repeatedly, but I think a full-size gas powered blower would have had the same problem. I am very happy with the product."
4,PLENTY OF POWER TO THROW THE SNOW,"I am surprised with the power of this little Giant. We had 8"" of wet snow couple days ago. I was unsure if this mechine was going to take care of that. Since this was the first time I was going to use the Toro, I made sure that everything was ready to go. I pluged in the cord and squized the handle. Wow!!!!!. What a power. I made a big cut on one side of driveway and worked perpendicular to that. It worked great. Even I was able to remove salted snow plowed by city trucks. Only thing that I did not like about it is the switch which you have to squeeze to keep it runing. After a while it gets though to hold it. I wish there was somekind of lock position on that. Other than that I love it."
5,Amazing!,"I have never owned a snowblower,never even wanted one. With a snow removal service that at best is mediocre I thought I'd try this easy to use,environmentally safe snow machine to augment the snow service. Wow!,I cleared my entire driveway plus two walkways from a 10"" snow storm here in Chicago today in half an hour. Easy to use,one hand on the Toro and one hand on the cord,never even broke a sweat. Even plowed through the pileup at the bottom of the driveway courtesy of our local municipality. Buy this and throw away the shovel! It really lives up to the positive reviews."
4,Make sure you really want the power cord hassle,"i bought this for my husband who does most of the snow clearing. This is a great snowblower in terms of power and effectiveness. I am a petite woman and I am able to push this through even the heaviest of snow that we get for Michigan winters. I specifically purchased it because I had too much trouble starting gas blowers, and i thought this would work best for both of us. However, my husband hates it because the power cord gets in his way. The cord has gotten stuck in the blower twice, and removing it is no small task. Thus, make sure you really want the hassle of looking out for the power cord before you buy this one."
5,Perfect snowblower for my driveway,"This snowblower is small, lightweight, and powerful for an electric model. It was the perfect solution for my 5-car parallel parking driveway with two walk ways. I used it for about 5 plowable snowfalls of varing depths and snow consistency. The 100 foot cord was sufficient to reach all parts of my driveway. There was one storm which dumped about 1.5 feet of light powder snow. The Toro 1800 had no problem clearing this. But it also proved effective after another storm by clearing about 8 inches of wet slushy snow. We were lucky that we did not have more snow in February and March because we're only a couple of blocks from the coast. The deeper the snow the more the need for multiple passes but you can easily lift the Toro to clear drifts a layer at a time. I can recommend it for light to moderate snowfalls. But I have yet to try it on a real block-buster of a storm which dumps more than 2 feet of heavy snow on us."
3,Light Weight,"One would have to get out early in the event of a storm and start cycling through every few hours. It's electric, no fuss until the power goes out. Then what? Lots of choices here, the reader will have to weigh out the factors which make this the better choice between gas or electric. A friend uses one of these and it does okay, another friend of mine, who lives in the snow belt, can only get by with an 11 hp gas, indicating that the 5hp gas couldn't handle the load. Well, if a 5hp gas can't handle the load in upstate NY, then this electric Toro would be hard pressed to prove otherwise. Check out consumer reports, and see what produces the most bang for the buck.That said, it's light and would probably handle the light chore of snow removal in a small driveway/walkway situation. I used to live in a town house up in the D.C. area and this would have been the ticket, except I was younger and whipping out a $10 snow shovel of good quality was not a problem."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!!!,I have had th Toro 1800 snowblower for two years and got it so that I would not reherniate a disk in my back. The snowblower work okay the first season lightweight and good in light fluffy snow. After that I had trouble with the on/off switch. I then replaced the switch and the motor burned out! It's junk save your money.
5,This is One Awesome Little Snow Thrower!!,"Works like a dream! Wish I could have found this size and cost for a gas powered one as we get frequent ice and snow storms and then the darn power goes out too!Really good deal, worth every penny."
5,Small but excellent performance,"Toro 1800 18-Inch 12 Amp Electric Curve Snow Thrower #38025I live in Maine and we've had one of the heaviest snowfalls in December. I love this little machine. It works great on fresh snowfall. If you wait until the snow is frozen solid, it struggles."
1,CONSUMERS BEWARE - TORO IS TEMPORARY!,"I purchased the Toro 1800 Power Curve in Nov. 2005. It fit my needs here in the NY area where we do not have many snowstorms. The machine worked OK for 3 seasons. But this past December, it died. I was clearing a path and stopped the machine to change directions. It would not start again. I called the Toro Customer Service toll free number, and listened to the recorded message. In short, Toro tells you that if you are beyond the 2 year warranty (which really is a 6 month warranty since you only use the machine in the winter months), the cost to repair the machine is too expensive and to buy a new one! So Toro is telling you that after 2 years the machine is not worth repairing. A very expensive temporary snow thrower! BEWARE OF TORO PRODUCTS."
5,Terrific snowthrower,"I used my Toro 1800 for the first time today and it did a great job. I've had the smaller version for years and loved it. This is an upgrade that obviously will be perfect for ""snowier"" blowing. It is easy to assemble but two people doing it is much better and faster. I highly recommend the 1800 for ease of use and job completion."
4,Great machine hate the cord,"The toro snow thrower has worked great for me, but not bullet proof.first use it grabbed the cord (my fault) and had to be totally disasembeled ( a harley tool kit works great) to untangle. a few weeks later found a rock in a snow pile about 2 inchs round and tore a chunk out of the auger, I have not repaired but torro still works great,It does not have enough power for the wet sloppy snow we are currently getting and clogs up alot (still better than a shovel).If I reorderd I would go with the gas model.cheersmike"
4,Nice Product !,"I really like this product. I bought it in the fall in anticipation of winter and it hasn't snowed yet! I thought I was buying a snow thrower and got something even better - a snow repeller! Seriously, the product arrived promptly and was easy to assemble. It is lightweight and easy o use. Though I haven't had to use it yet this winter, I bought it because a friend has one and it works great. I am looking forward to the next snowfall."
5,toro,My husband really loves it. It does a great job on our walkways & decks. I couldn't believe how fast it came!
4,Easier to use than a gas model,"This lightweight machine was simple to put together and wonderfully easy to manuever. Since I am handicapped I found it very easy to handle. The one thing I do have a problem with is the handlebar. It seems the only way to move the thrower around without engaging the motor is by grabbing it by the midbar (below the handlebar) which is somewhat difficult, otherwise, the motor starts and you accidentally run over the power cord and it jambs the blade."
2,appealing but flawed,"I purchased the Toro product because I liked the benefits of an electric thrower: no pollution, no gas, etc. In several modest Michigan snow storms it has done ok, but within the first two months of use the internal belt has fried/broken. This does not seem right, and gives me little confidence in the long-term viability of the product and its design and materials.Too bad, since the idea of an electric thrower is appealing.Re the cord: annoying to have to constantly adjust, but you learn to live with it and navigate a path to avoid too much relocating of the cord."
2,Threw Drive Belt Twice in First Hour,"I used this blower for the first time today in about four inches of wet snow. The blower threw the snow about 8-9 feet in these conditions. The drive belt fell off twice in the first hour of use. Putting the belt back on is a ten-minute process. I did not hit any obstacle, and this problem should not happen.This unit seems suitable only for light residential duty.Dec 19, 8 PM - After one more hour the blower threw the belt three more times. Absolute junk it seems to me after my first two hours of use."
5,halabi,"This snow thrower perfect for a 10"" of dry snow, very fast and easy to use, I have no problem what so ever handling the cord, if I have to buy another one I will buy the same one."
4,Good value,"I've has this for 2 winters and I'm glad I waited to post my review as there are a couple of things you need to get accustomed to. The cord is a pain at first but after a year of use, it simply doesn't seem as bad. Let me start by saying that if you have a medium to small driveway and (and this is a big ""and"") you are able to use this machine before your family has driven on the snow and packed it in, this machine will do the trick very nicely. It could throw the snow a little farther, but for the most part it performs adequately in this area. A little better would avoid you blowing the same snow more than once. If it would cut through packed snow just a little better it would get 5 stars."
2,Belt keeps coming off!,"I purchased the Toro Curve snow thrower after seeing all the positive reviews and wanting an effective, more cost friendly alternative to a gas powered blower. I tried it for the first time today during a very cold powdery snowfall, and it works great when it's working, HOWEVER, the drive belt keeps falling off!! I had to remove the side cover and re-install the belt twice, which is a pain, and then finally gave up after the belt came off a third time. It seems this would be a great snow thrower when it's actually running, and I would like to increase my 2 star review. I'll need to bring it to a Toro service center and see if there's anything that can be done, otherwise it will have to be returned."
5,snow thrower,I love this snow thrower. It is easy to use and I like not having to fill up the gas and pull the cord. I reccommend this to everyone.
4,snow thrower is a lot of fun,I bought this snowthrower and found it easy to assemble and very easy to use. It is actually fun to operate and now i am sort of wishing it would snow so i can get some more use out of it. good buy for the money
2,Very Disappointing,"This product is difficult to assemble unless you're a guy with a workshop or a woman who took shop in school! Once assembled, its performance was disappointing -- the snow we had was too much for it and the discharge chute kept clogging. Although it was easier on my back than shovelling, it took about the same amount of time. Also, it really works best on a completely level surface (e.g., concrete), as it has problems with anything that's slightly uneven, such as brick paths."
4,Great Small Snowblower,"This is the first snowblower we have ever owned. We chose electric to avoid the hassle of maintaining a gas engine that will sit unused for 6 months. We assumed that the snowblower was operated by a rechargeable battery and were VERY surprised to find that it is not. It requires an electrical extension cord. While the snowblower works great, it is awkward to use it due to the power cord. It feels kind of like vacuuming but you don't dare run over the cord! We do really like it even given the challenge of working with the power cord. We would definitely recommend it to anyone who is willing to work with the power cord."
1,Died when plugged and started for the first use,"When I plugged in the power and pressed the started bar after setup, I smelled the burning smoke. The motor seemed working because it got the motor sound. But the rotor (for collecting snow) did not rotate or move.In view of the overall good users' comments for the product but with some comments on the quality issues like mine, the product certainly needs better quality assurance before leaving the factory.I returned the item to Amazon for refund. Amazon's return procedure is simple and fast."
1,Never again,"Purchased late 2008 used in NJ for about 4 moderate snows. In December 2009 the blower would not keep the drive belt on the unit. Apparently something is bent or broken inside. Motor is fine and all external parts are fine. When Toro was contacted they refused to honor the two year warranty since the issue was obvious owner abuse (not in my case). The local Toro repair shop said the repairs on this type of unit would exceed to cost of a new unit. What I have is junk. If your unit does fail, do not count on the warranty. Consider this purchase a ""throw away."" No more Toro products for me."
1,Better off with a shovel!,"I bought the 1800 in October 2008. I did not use it until February 2009. It worked well that day. Today on December 20, 2009 I used it for a second time clearing about 6 inches of dry snow and it died! You can hear the motor run, but the blades don't turn! Im going to try to get my money back and get someting better!"
1,Belt broke in less than 5 minutes,"Belt got chewed up and broke after less than 5 minutes of use. It appeared to work well during its short life. When I opened it up, it looked like the main rotor wasn't exactly lined up properly, which caused the belt to jump off track. I am shipping this back for a replacement."
5,"Evens works on 24"" of snow","I bought this snow thrower a few years ago but had it stored in my shed because the teenage boy across the street would always shovel my driveway. This past weekend we got 24"" of snow in Southern NJ and no teenage boy available. My daughter and I were able to put the Toro together in about 1/2 hour and were AMAZED at how well it worked - even in very deep snow. Two neighbors borrowed it after I was done and they loved it. The snow was soft and powdery so don't know how well it will work with wet, slushy snow but it definitely was a life safer for this past weekend. Well worth the money."
1,"Got a bad one, worst experience ever","Judging by the other reviews, I recognize that my experience isn't typical but-I received my PowerCurve in November 2005. The belt slipped within the first minute of use. I put it back in place but it kept slipping.First repair simpy replaced the beltAfter it broke immediately, second repair replaced it again, this time doing some ""additional calibration""After it broke immediately again, the third time the toro repaid guy identified a bigger problem that he couldn't fix. So, I took it to a ""master"" repair guy at the end of last season.First use, this season, it broke within the first minute. AAAARRRRRGGGGGGH!!!!What's worse is that while its still under warranty, Toro says it has to be returned to the retailer and Amazon says they won't take it back after 30 days. At the very least, maybe a Brick and Mortar is best for purchases like this."
5,great so far,"I didnt want to be bothered with storing and caring for a gasolene powered snow blower since it doesnt usually snow much here in Delaware. This seemed perfect. It has worked very well for two small 3-6 inch storms and now it even worked well in this ""presidents day storm"" of over two feet. I made sure to go out before it got too deep, so I ended up doing my 4 to 6 car driveway twice. Even when the snow is too deep for it, it is easy to lift up and eat away at the snow in several layers. I doubt that it would hold up to many storms like this but so far it has worked well and there are no signs of damage or wear."
5,A Great Little Machine!!!,"I purchased the Toro 1800 Snow Thrower on February 11, 2009. This is my 2nd. year of using this Excellent piece of equiptment. It will throw snow well over 16 inches deep, as I did only today! I have never had any problems with it at all. I told my Son-In-Law about how excellent a job it does for me. He purchased one also from Amazon.Com recently. He was surprised, did His whole drive with it. I cannot say enough about how well it handles snow. Excellent Product!!!!!!"
3,it broke on third use,worked beautifully- throws snow far and is light and easy to handle. Problem is it broke the third time I used it. Snow was about 4 inches and dry. shouldn't have been a problem. It is under warranty and I hope it is repaired before our next storm- in 5 days.
1,Broke first time I used it,"This piece of junk broke the second time I used it. We had a wet snow in the DC area(4""), and this POS went about 10 feet, and the motor sounded like a gear stripped. Maybe a belt broke, who knows.I had one of these TORO 1800's before, that worked great for 15 years, but these new ones must be made someplace else. Maybe the same crew as those who are making TOYOTA gas pedals? Amazon seems cool about returning this, but I am very disappointed in TORO's quality control. I threw away the box, and now am going to have to pay dearly to package up this piece of junk and send it back."
4,Toro 1800,"After this past years snowfall in Minnesota, I was totally beat after shoveling 3 feet of accumulated snow from my 12' x 24' elevated deck (with 3' high railings). I also have a 14'x 16' basement patio that God decided I should shovel as well (same depth). After taking care of the shoveling, at age 62, I decided I should maybe look for some assistance. (God only helps in April). The Toro 1800 turns out to be a wonderful machine for handling the back deck and basement patio. It blew the snow a lot farther than I expected for such a small compact machine. The 3' high railings on the back deck posed no problem. I would guess the sweat effort is 80% less than my manual shovel. Great machine.I did not expect it to handle my 70' x 50' 3 car garage apron. I have a Toro Powermax 1128 to handle that issue. Great machine also, another story."
1,Toro Electric Snow Blower,"When I received this snow blower I thought I had made a wise choice. It is light weight and easy to assemble. However, when I tried to use it, the belt came off. I tried twice and the drive belt came off within a few seconds each time. This would be a GREAT snow blower for sidewalks and even fairly long driveways and would suit my purpose perfectly IF it worked. When I bought it, I read all the reviews and determined that the complaints about throwing the drive belt were a small percentage and I would not have a problem. Was I ever wrong. This is an ideal snow blower if it works. Unfortunately, my experience was a bad one and I returned the blower for a refund. On the bright side, Amazon is great at making things right when the product is bad. I had no trouble getting a credit to my card within 5 days of sending the blower back. Kudos to Amazon. Toro, please get your act together. Fix the problem with the drive belt. This would be an incredible machine if you do."
5,DFLYNN,I am a 63 year old female. I had to use the snow blower yesterday for the first time. All I can say is this little snow blower removed up to 24 inches of snow. I was able to remove the snow without any problem. I have a 50 feet driveway. When I opened the garage door the snow was a least 2 feet high. I just turned on the machine and the snow was removed with ease. Any women can handle this machine.It was a nice feeling that I was able to remove the snow without depending on another person. You can never find a teenager when you need them.
5,powerful enough for wisconsin winter,"i bought this snow thrower for my dad who lives in wisconsin. it's been over a year now and so far he's really happy w/ the product. they get pretty deep snow out there, but nothing the toro 1800 can't handle. my parents especially like the electrical part, b/c they don't like the ordor emitted from gas blowers. the cord can be an annoyance, but it's something that they don't mind. they also like the small form factor and that it's easy to store in the garage and easy to take out."
5,Power House Snow Thrower,"I initially bought this product for removing snow from our deck, but have found myself using it for our driveway as well when we have several inches of snow. It will even takle compacted snow at the end of the driveway resulting from the street snow plowing. If you are looking for a light weight machine and don't mind managing the electrical cord, this one does an excellent job and is very easy to use."
2,I've burned up two of these in three years,"My first one lasted two years, so I guess I was fooled. The second one died in it's third or fourth use. First starts smoking and smelling of burnt plastic and then....foof. I suppose these are OK for two inches or so of fluffy snow, but that's about it. In addition, it's difficult to get the handles on them, and the spout often pops straight up whether you want it to or not when snow pushes against it. On the plus side it's light.Anyhow, I wouldn't get one of these unless you live south of Delaware."
4,It does exactly what it claims,I find the 1800 Power Curve to be just the right thing for a home owner with a lot of area to clear. The ability to clear a one foot snow fall is very easy if it is light and fluffy but it gets tougher if you wait and the snow gets wet and icy. I can clear a 150 foot long 15 feet wide drive with a 20 by 20 foot parking area in one hour after a one foot snow fall. No gas to keep on hand and no fumes to breath. It is very user friendly but get a bigger maching for the north country.
1,garbage,Bought this unit 3 years ago. Broke on its first use. Fixed it; broke again after one use. Fixed it again; broke again on its first use. I have never owned a more worthless product in my life. You'd be better off with a large spoon.
5,"Incredible performance, and fun too!","One hot day in September, I ordered the Toro 1800 Snow Thrower, then prayed for snow. I got my wish, and then some. I had every confidence that it would work well, but it has performed well above my expectations. Once I figured out the length of the electric cord, and how to maneuver around it, clearing the snow from my driveway was easy. Even better, it was fun - and fast. I need a little more practice with directing the snow, especially with a wind blowing. Still, very pleased with the product.Note: Female, mid-aged, Brooklyn, NY"
5,Thumbs Up!,"Used it for the first time on 8-inches of snow. I was doubtful that the machine would handle the load, but it cut through with power to spare. It even handled the heavier mess from the city plows. Overall, it exceeded my expectation, and they were already high after researching and reading many favorable reviews. This is a good buy.Pros: Compact, lightweight, hangs on my garage wall, and it works!Cons: Noisier than expected for an electric."
1,CHEAP! Dont' buy it!,"After two or three uses the belt slipped off. I opened it up and slid it back on. First storm of season two the drive belt broke. Very cheap, use the $300 on a down payment on a real snow blower. Wish I had..."
2,Get a different one,"Well, i love the star wars models and most of them seem to be decent quality, the b-wing on the other hand seems cheap, has no color, and is generally small and unsatisfying."
3,"Pirates Cove, not that great!","I bought this game because my 4 year old son is a pirate fanatic. First of all the game sits upon four carboard pieces and the bottom of the box. It does not stay together so while playing the game your constantly fixing the game board. Second, the game is not that fun. My son played it a couple of times and then proceeded to tell me that all he wants is the pirate pieces because the game is too hard. I would not reccomend this game for younger children as it is hard to keep thier attention long enough to complete even one game."
5,Makes methyl B-12 easy to swallow!,"Best tasting methyl B-12 I've found and definitely the best price. These sublingual tablets are a little slower to dissolve than some I have tried, which is not a problem as they are not sticky or grainy. I will definitely stay with this brand!"
4,Don't taste as good as they used to.,"While I feel that this is a quality product, I initially chose it over other brands because it tasted the best. However, the last 2 bottles I have received have not tasted as good. The tablets are chewable with a slightly orange flavor."
5,Excellent Resource,"If you missed Mr. Richters' long overdue retrospective, currently travelling the country, then this book is an excellent runner-up. Mr. Storrs concise interviewing and cataloguing offers readers a clear insight into one of the worlds' most prolific living painters. The chance to view Mr. Richters' work in the round, from 1962 to the present, including abstact and figurative and sculpture, is available only in this book and provides an excellent resource for art buffs and students alike. A perfect compliment to a fantastic show."
2,"beautiful pictures, questionable text","This was a gorgeous show, but kind of conservative -- made Richter into the new ""master"" of painting, sidelines all his weirder and more ""conceptual"" work. And why does Robert Storr have to try so hard to put himself at the center of everything?? I saw the Richter show in SF around 1990, so no, this is NOT ""the frist American retrospective."" And Storr's dismissive (and often really uninformed) treatment of other critics (especially German critic Benjamin Buchloh, who's written on Richter for like, decades) shows what a limited writer and scholar Storr really is. But for better or worse, the pictures are great, and a lot of the other material is really good."
5,WOW,"Unbelievable book. Wonderful reproductions of the brilliant Gerhard Richter's work and wonderful words by the brilliant Robert Storr. The interview in the back between the two is my favorite. This is the definitive book on Gerhard Richter. I would recommend it to anyone. This book generally retails in museum stores for $85, by the way."
2,"Cable ""Set"" Misleading","This cable 'set' is a single tri-plex (KB-PS2, Mouse-PS2, Video-VGA-DB15) molded assembly. One 'set' is required for each computer connected to the KVM Switchbox.They appear to be good cables, but at $24 each, it would cost another $96 for a full set to go with the Linksys 4 port KVM (Linksys SVIEW04 ProConnnect 4-station CPU KVM Switchwhich would require 4 of these cables.Returned the one 'set' I bought as a sample."
3,A good introduction,"This book gives some background, and a good deal of introductory information, on the Chinese art of QiGong. It is well illustrated, and it's small, pocket size makes it ideal for when you're on the go. It is by no means a be-all, end-all book on QiGong, and I would not even recommend it as the first book you should pick up if you're new to QiGong, but it does serve as an adequate introduction.There are a few things I dislike about this book. For starters, they spend a lot of time (and pages) on a long White Crane form, instead of introducing readers to simpler, more approachable exercies such as The Eight Pieces of Brocade. Also, having all of the models in this book dress alike makes them look like cult members (the chick with the crew cut doesn't help)!If you're new to QiGong, I recommend ""The Way Of QiGong"" by Kenneth Cohen instead."
1,Positive Options for Living with Your Ostomy: Self-Help and Treatment,"As someone who has struggled to adapt to a completely unexpected ileostomy for the past three and a half months, I found the information presented to be disappointingly simplistic and annoyingly naive. It is hard for me to believe that the author has ever worked closely with people trying to deal with the every day challenges presented by life with an ileostomy. He frequently comes across as patronizing and offers little real help to such persons. There is no way I could recommend this book to others who are trying to cope with the challenges I have experienced."
4,For the Anthropologist Foodie,"I'm reading this for a college class and it hasn't reduced me to absolute boredom yet. It's a pretty enlightening compilation of essays on different aspects of the global food market, different cultures and how they are affected by it, and some of the important details surrounding our problematic current state. I think if anyone gave it a chance, they'd get something out of it - but I know, if not for this class, I would not have ever picked this up. In any case, I'm glad I did."
3,exellent service,"Thakns for an exellent service, the item arrived 1 week from when I order it.I will use amazon in the future."
4,I want mouse support,"This game is a fun but i am missing mouse. after playing first 3 games in the series with the mouse, keyboard feels hectic."
5,I JUST HAVE TO SUPPORT MY SISTER,CHONITA P. COLEMAN IS MY SISTER AND I JUST WANTED TO SUPPORT AND GET HER NAME OUT BECAUSE SHE IS TRYING NEW THINGS PRODUCTION WISE. LOOK OUT FOR HER!
3,Sway Bar end link kit,"The items in this kit look, work and fit fine but beware, there is only one end link in this kit - the picture is deceptive as it shows 2.Sort of false advertising in my opinion. But as I said, the links work fine."
5,Greatest Little Printer in TOWN,I print about 400 copies a month most financial analyses and some WEB articles. I just bought an HP 1115 Photosmart Printer. After an initial week of massive paper jams I returned the printer --based on advice from the HP support group and bought this printer instead. You take it out of the box - load the software and GO. It really pushes out black and white fast and the color is just fine. THIS is a fine printer and a real bargain.
2,!ATTENTION BUYER!,I got one of these with my new computer and I was sooooooooo wrong to do that. The ink is very cheep I have to admit that but the paper feeder broke after 3 months of good service. If you want a good printer go with HP if not do go with cannon. I sopouse that is the reason its 100.00 dollars.
5,Inexpensive to own and operate,I opted for this printer in a systems bundle over the normal Lexmark offering. I already own a S600 but wanted a printer for my kids to use and this was the choice for me. Graphics are good and so is text. Speed is high for this price point. I am using this on a T1220 emachines system on a home network and am sharing it with my laptop. Everything has worked to perfection. It has auto on/off power settings and ink cartridge meters. The other thing that made this my choice was the cost of ink replacement. My daughter uses Disney Magic Artist and can drain ink faster than she drains a gallon of milk (fast).Replacement cartridges are much more reasonable than other brands. Good Value printer!!!!!
4,Guitar wall Hanger,"Item was as stated. Not as nice as the wooden type that I have, but half the cost and seems to be more than sturdy enough to hold the instruments."
5,"Looks Awesome, Does its job, Solid Hold.","Looks great, safely holds guitars, nice black finish, my guitars hang all day and still strong. Way cheaper online, at Hermes Music store they cost 15 bucks. I bought two of them."
5,Solid Hanger,"It works great. Just for reference, I'm using the drywall anchors that came with to hang my les paul (very heavy axe). Only gripe is that it doesn't come with a wall bumper to protect the bottom of your guitar, but this won't be a problem if you treat your axe with respect."
3,hose extension,Not a good value for the product. wouldn't buy this again since it wasn't long enough for what I needed.
2,please save your money,"OH MY GOODNESS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED AT ALL! THIS CD NOT ONLY IS NON VOCALS BUT MADONNA HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH ITS RELEASE,INSIDE THE SLEAVE HER NAME ISNT EVEN MENTIONED!THE FRONT SLEAVE DOESNT EVEN HAVE A PICTURE OF HER BUT RATHER A LOOK-A-LIKE. THE PRICE OF THIS CD (5.00) SHOULD BE U'RR FIRST CLUE THIS ISNT WHAT IT APPEARS,WHEN I ORDERED THIS CD AND OPENED THE PACKAGE THE CASE FELL APART.PLEASE SAVE U'RR MONEY AND BUY A CD THAT MADONNA ACTUALLY HAD SOMETHING 2 DO WITH!"
2,No vocals; definitely 'easy listening'; elevator music.,"Oh boy, not at all what I expected, especially being a fan of Madonna's music. The front sleeve appears NOT to be a photo of Madonna up-close, but rather a look-alike. With the price of the CD being just above $5.00, I suppose it's okay to buy, if even for the remade/non-vocal versions of the tracks listed. It's a chance buy, and being a fan and collector, I'm okay with it. Buyer's choice.... good luck in deciding :)"
5,cute as can be,I am doing a Christmas tree with a candy theme and this caught my eye. It is so cute and lightweight. Perfect
5,Always A Pleasure,"One of my all-time favorite authors who never disappoints me. This is not my first time reading ""Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters"" but it is the first time that I noticed the quotation in the front of the book which explains the title.I did not experience J. D. Salinger's work until I returned to college as an adult but as soon as I read one of his short stories I was hooked. I am not a particular fan of the short story but I own most of Salinger's and read them over again every few years. His stories of the Glass family continue to intrigue me and reading the recent biography of Salinger added to my fondness for these stories. I just sent my copy of ""Frannie and Zooey"" to my grandson. He is fourteen, reads at the college level and it is hard for me to find books that I like and think will interest him.I highly recommend this book for readers from teenagers to retirees like me."
1,DO NOT BUY - FAKE ITEMS!!!,"If you see a so-called ""Tiffany"" necklace or bracelet with a ""Return to Tiffany & Co."" tag and a toggle clasp, you know it is NOT AUTHENTIC. I know this to be true because I checked with Tiffany & Co., and they told me they DO NOT MAKE any such item. We have authentic Tiffany jewelry from a Tiffany store and could tell the difference right away. The one positive note is that the seller gave me a full refund right away when I complained."
5,A great retrospective,"I bought this video a few months ago and I must say with all off the behind the scenes stuff, it is great addtion for anyone who is a TLC fan. My only problem, it's so short I have to watch it over and over"
5,Great Reference!!!!! for True Fans of the tunes!,"I'm glad I found it!!!!! A much better source of info than anything I've seen floating around on Tab sights! On another note, its an interesting piece of memorabilia too because of the numerous 80's photos with the late Eric Carr. The only flaw? No bass notation."
5,Reliable as my old model,I was shopping and based on the reliability of my Casio CTK-511 I selected this model. This is a fun reasonable priced Keyboard with great sound and good features. Consider this one!!!
2,"Works for Disney, Doesn't work for Scooby","Two stars to Hanna Barbara for trying a Scooby Doo Musical. Note to H-B: Please don't ever do this again. Result is a steaming pile of failure. Minus one star to Amazon because the description is totally wrong (Daphne is not part of a Vampire musical).Painful to watch and I wouldn't even recommend it for dedicated Scooby Doo fans. It's like they had a good idea for a ""What's New Scooby Doo"" 20 minute episode and needed something to turn it into a movie. By far one of the worst Scooby movies ever made."
3,absolutely adorable,"Very cute and entertaining children's movie cartoon. I would recommend this title for the ages of 8 and younger, I think they will get the most enjoyment out of it."
2,no need for a musical,"I find myself asking ""why?"" Why did scooby doo need a musical? Then I realize about half way through it: its because they had little to no plot and needed filler to make it add up to the needed 70ish minutes. Otherwise, they would have barely had a 20 minute episode on their hands.With the most recent additions to the library, I thought they were actually getting pretty well on track. Then this. Horrible. I only give it two stars because I can't give anything 'scooby doo' one star, no matter how bad."
3,"Huge Scooby fan, but...",I am a huge Scooby fan as are 3 of my children so we usually order/buy the the movies when they come out. It was a fun spin on a musical and the tunes are catchy. But as a Christian I found the reference to the guy who couldn't sell books about God offensive. There really was no reason to put a Christian slur in a kids movie. I believe the original creators had better taste and I hate to see Scooby used to push a spiritual bias.
5,scooby fan,I love this musical it was very entertaining. I love the animation and the music kept both adults and the kids actively involved in the movie. This is one I would recommend to anyone who wants some family entertainment.
2,Don't bother; unless you love Scooby AND Musicals,"Wife and I don't like musicals but we like Scooby and the gang. Unfortunately, the negatives of this movie being a musical out weight the fact it's Scooby. Our kids like the show but get bored during the songs. For my wife and I, it's punishing to watch. Not sure why it gets such favorable reviews."
1,Just say no to Ultraviolet Digital Copies,Ultraviolet is just another attempt by the movie industry to control how you view content. Never buy Blu-rays with Ultraviolet Digital copies. iTunes digital copies are far superior because they are cross platform and put you in control of your content.
4,A Scooby Doo Musical?!,"Let me start off by saying that I'm completely obsessed with Scooby Doo. I have been since I was a kid and now at 20, I still watch all the cartoons, tv movies, and dtv movies. I can't get enough.That said, we turn to Music of the Vampire. It's really unlike any other Scooby movie ever made but at the same time it's remarkably familiar. I really enjoyed watching it. Sure, not all the songs are amazing but it's a whole lot of fun and there are at least 3 genuinely wonderful musical numbers in the film. It's a fun little mystery with the voice cast at the top of their games and singing(!) except for Mindy Cohn. All in all, I am very pleased with this new flick and I wouldn't be opposed to another musical installment of Scooby and the Gang!"
4,Just a Fun Movie,"While not the best of the Scooby Doo movies, this is a fun one. If you like Scooby Doo you'll probably like this one too. If you're a Scooby Doo purist, then you probably won't appreciate it. The musical twist is kinda neat, with the cast doing the actual singing. The music itself is fun as well. Again, this is jut fun - not the most brilliant mystery, but just a good Scooby Doo movie. Perhaps the best part was the fact that they make fun of the Twilight books - BRAVO!"
2,One of two broken,One of the two gyros was out of balance. The second unit worked well.The packaging was not sufficient to protect the units during shipment.
5,Well made,Very well made. Spins forever. I hope the kids will have as much fun as my dad. This present was his idea.
2,Ok quality. Price is right,"This is definitely an ""old school"" gyroscope. Solid enough for the price, but I feel like I am playing with lead."
3,happy moments,timeless n nostaglia. it is entertaining for people of all ages from 0-99. watch it spins as you dream away
2,Broke within 10 minutes. :-(,"Son accidentally dropped it within 10 minutes from a height of about 30 inches onto kitchen floor. It broke. Unfortunately, any bend, dent, etc... will cause the gyro not to work properly. Be VERY careful."
5,"Great Value, Fun Toy!","These were already considered ""classic"" toys when I was a kid but I loved them and still do as an adult! The two pack is a good value and kids will love starting them and watching them ""battle"" and clang together. Not specifically educational in themselves but will spark a child's curiosity as to how they can balance on a string and how they work!"
2,Both gyroscopes broke,I had fun with the gyroscope for 3 days until both gyroscopes broke. On the one gyroscope the outer ring fell off. On the other gyroscope the gasket fell off and the whole thing spins not just the center.
1,Poor Quality,"I was very disappointed with this toy. One of the pins at the end of the flywheel broke very quickly. We haven't used the second unit yet as my grandson in only 3 years old and doesn't have as much interest in the toy as I expected. Maybe later. Also, and I can't prove this, but I remember my originnal gyroscope, back in the 40's being larger and I remember playing with it a lot with no quality issues. Today, some imported items are made very well, in my estimation, but this was not one of them. Be advised to spend your money on a toy of better quality. Too bad Fisher-Price doesn't make gyros."
1,Tedco Twin Gyros,"A great educational toy for young children. Unfortunately, if you are looking for a decent gyroscope for an adult this is not the right item. I knew that there was a risk of this being a cheapy but chose to try it out anyway. Both gyros are poorly balanced and thus many basic tricks wont work due to vibration. At high spin rates the gyros are very unstable and noisy. If you are old enough to appreciate quality pop a few extra bucks and get a precision gyroscope instead."
3,Not particularly well made,"These are fun to play with for the first couple of hours. However, from the beginning I realised how poorly these were made. The material used is plenty sturdy but the gyroscopes are not very well balanced causing a lot of rattle keeping them from spinning for too long. This was the case for both of the ones I received. If you use sufficient lubrication this problem can be mitigated but I was still a bit underwhelmed quality wise."
3,One not working,"With these products you have a 50/50 chance of getting one that works or one that doesn't. In the box i got, the first one i picked up out of it did not work. The wheel on it had too much friction to go fast enough or stay at a fast pace. The second one in the box was alright though. So beware that you have a chance of getting one that doesn't work or both that don't work or both that do work."
3,GOOD BUT NOT GREAT,THIS IS A GOOD OLD TIME LEARNING TOY. UNFORTUNATELY IT IS OF A LESSER QUALITY THAN I'D HOPED. THE BALANCE IS OFF SLIGHTLY ON THE WHEEL. THIS CAUSES THE GYRO TO WOBBLE EXCESSIVELY AND FALL QUICKLY.
3,neat,"As advertised and expected. Cumbersome to windup and employ. Relatively sturdy, but highly malleable to young curious hands."
4,Good to learn,"Great toy to get kids interested in how the world works around them. Good way to get started. I would have liked to see more info and uses, but you can look those up online."
3,Grown-ups I bought it for had seen gyroscopes,"Arrived on time and as described. I still think it's a good toy, but there were other major attractions, and the adults for whom I bought it were more interested in playing with the baby. It didn't get a proper chance."
2,"""Original"" Does Not Mean It's Well-Made","I have a fond memory about gyroscope. I played with one with my little brother when I was a young boy.Naturally, I wanted to share the joy of gyroscope with my two kids and ordered one-twin pack. I didn't know about the company, TEDCO, but maybe I was duped by the adjective ""Original.""The products (two gyroscopes) arrived as promised, but they didn't work very well. In fact, both of them made this 'clinking' sound (which means the rotation is not perfect); they don't stand upright-this negates the very notion of gyroscope, doesn't it? How come they screw up with this very simple device?My kids and I tried for a couple of hours to make them work but, in the end, it was not worth it. What TEDCO made was not the kind of gyroscope my brother and I played with. I'm very disappointed."
4,Good collectable,"If you haven't played with gyro, get this I am 30 and never seen a gyro so I got this. I depeloped interest in gyro seeing videos and reading about them. .. fascinating object. So this goes to my collection.The the material looks cheap but its not its pretty heavy duty. I have read in some review that this does not function properly, well ""pull the string hard!!!"""
3,Not satisfied with quality,"I was surprised how fragile this product is. The welds came apart and rendered the units useless until I soldered them back together. If I bought the gyros for myself I would have thrown them away, but I bought them for my son and since repairing them he has enjoyed them."
1,Recycle or just Toss?,"I've tried probably 50 times but I can not get either of them to balance after it's spinning. They spin beautifully, but won't stand up on their own, they fall over and continue to spin."
5,Wonderful!!!!,"Thourough and indepth, to the point, and easy to read. It is well worth the time spent reading it. For those who love truth and history, it is a must read. It is eye opening. Dr. Grady deals with things many people are too afraid to deal with. I appreciate his willingness to tell the truth without sugar-coating the facts."
5,What Hath God Wrought,Grady is an excellent researcher and historian. This book is a must for everyone interested in knowing the truth.W. B. Murdock
2,Unbelievable,I enjoyed the early parts of this book but then the author started knocking Billy Graham and Michael W.Smith.Also Chuck Swindoll.I don't think he likes any other Christians except the ones exactly like him.Also he is so anti-Catholic it was hard to read his comments even though I am not Catholic.
1,Evil and nonsenscial diatribe,"It's been several years since I read this book, so it's not exactly fresh in my mind. However, the fact that I am writing this is to warn anybody that this book is nothing but pure evil. I am a Christian, but this book made me ashamed of that. I don't like being lumped together with idiots.A couple excerpts that I remember:Harriet Beecher Stowe was ""another example of a woman who should have stayed home baking cookies"" and JFK was ""a Catholic fornicator who got what was coming to him.""That should give you an idea of the tone of the book.Also, his paranoia about nearly everything really is mind-boggling. His argument about paper money being ""funny money"" is hilarious. Well, it's hilarious in a sad sort of way. I asked a friend of mine to read the book. He review was ""It would be funny ... if it weren't so scary.""But, if you like paranoid delusions and spewing hatred, this is a must read."
3,Okay,This book was an okay read. I thought the story at times was tiring and the going back and forth. I skip some pages and didn't miss a beat.
3,"Not That Bad, I Guess, but Not That Good Either!","I know what I'm in for when I read a Sneaky Pie Brown book, so I shouldn't have been surprised with this one. It's the usual fare - murders in Crozet and all the citizens getting involved in trying to find the murderer. Then there's Tucker and Mrs. Murphy (Harry's pets) who always seem to figure things out before the humans do. These books are definitely of the ""cozy"" genre, and the characters themselves are quirky enough to make them interesting, but the stories are a little silly. I always figure out who the murderer is right at the very beginning of the book, and then there's usually one or two more murders after that, so as I read I wait for them to happen. In this book we have a dead biker first, and then some shenanigans at the local bank that seem to be connected with the dead biker. I will continue to read this series for the characters (for a time anyway)."
5,"Review of ""Pay Dirt""","Rita Brown has created two cats and a Corgi as partners with her main characters in solving murder mysteries. Set in a small Virginia town, all her characters are colorful and believable and I have really enjoyed the whole Sneaky Pie Brown mystery series."
3,It's Okay.,"If you are looking for a CD with just sounds of rain, don't buy this CD. I bought it thinking it would simply be the sound of ""Stormy Weather"" as the title states, but it is in fact the sound of rain and thunder with classical music mixed in. It really isn't soothing because there are high-pitched flutes and the other music in the background. So, if you like variations on ""Stormy Weather"", and not just the sound of rain and thunder, then buy this cd. Otherwise, I recommend looking somewhere else."
4,Envelopes are fine,They are exactly what they look like. The paper is sort of stiff and crinkly and the label glue is not fun to lick.
2,HMMM,best i could do in my short time I had but not really worth the money. But it did come in early.
1,Where Do I Begin?,"These pens are so bad I don't even know where to start. They are the leakiest, shortest-lasting, heaviest, and most difficult to write with pens I've ever had. They ""skipped"" a lot, where there would be no ink and you'd have to rewrite/write over the blank spots, and then at other times too much ink came out. They didn't last long, which was a relief because I hated using them and a disappointment because it's a LOT of pen to toss into a landfill. Would never use again. I'm sorry I strayed from my trust Uniball Visions."
5,This is among my 5 favorites!,The Gemini game is a very good book. It's very exiting and maybe a little violent. There is one problem: It's too short!
1,horrible,I just got this in the mail. Its horrible. Its not fabric. Its hard rubberised plastic. It is NOT balanced for wearing on your head. If you want something to sit on a shelf this might be ok for you. Its not ok for me. If I had known it was hard rubberised plastic I would not have ordered it. I am returning this product.
1,Unacceptable,"We sent our son a powermatic saw for Christmas. When it arrived and when assembled the table was way out of tolerance.So he called Tool Crib and arrangements were made to return the old one and send a new one, which you very nicely did. That one was more out of tolerance than the first. So he called and both saws were picked up at the same time. I have an email which states that you will credit us for the saw. He (son) has made other arrangements for a saw. We do most of our tool business with you and are sorry that this happened, which I am sure you are also. Perhaps you received a bad batch of saws from Powermatic. Vernon Harrington"
2,There have been worse...,"Well, it wasn't all that bad. For a standard men's adventure, it was pretty typical stuff: trite plot, shallow characterizations, longer on action than intelligence. It was readable.However, Destoyer fans are used to a bit more. Most of us have read scores of these books, we KNOW who these characters are, what they think, how they interact. This book came across sort of blurred, as if written by someone who didn't quite get it, wasn't comfortable with parody and subtlety. It's not as blatantly bad as the worst ones...This book sort of dumbs it all down, sort of tries to turn this into just another men's adventure series. What do you think? Will Mack Bolan guest star in a future book?Get it to complete your collection. Don't expect the worst, but don't expect to be enthralled either! Remo and Chiun are out there somewhere...we're just waiting for them to come back!"
3,Surpisingly Acceptable Story,"After seeing all the negative reviews on amazon.com, I was going to skip this one at first.The story is actually fairly tight. Although it didn't read quite as smoothly as most of Jim Mullaney's novels, it was a decent adventure story.A lot of the dialogue between Remo and Chiun and Remo and Smith seemed forced / unnatural, but that is really the only problem I saw with the book.If you want a really good Destroyer, pick up Assassin's Handbook 2 at warrenmurphy dot com - he may still have a few autographed copies available."
5,good read,"easy reading book , make you chuckle some with the interaction. Lots of excitment. I would read the whole series. Great series."
1,Popster,I was so disappointed . It arrived very damaged.It was a hassle to returnDid credit me back once they received it back
2,A Noble Effort,"A nice try by the author. But his lack of knowledge and omissions of dozens of psychedelic bands (especially American artists) makes this a very incomplete work. His reviews are also weak as he barely lists but a few words or recomendations on each artist. The lp,cd and album listings are quite good. Perhaps a few more years of research and music listening would have made this a good reference book."
2,Interviewing for Dummies...in the 80's....in New Zealand,"Unfortunately there aren't too many books out there on journalist interviewing, so I took a swing at this one, and struck out. Although published in 2002, the content feels very old, very little about online journalism.I learned nothing new in there, all the info is pretty much common sense, so it's more of a ""for dummies"" book.It's very Australia/NZ-focused - so great if you're from that region, but otherwise you'll be clueless to the interviewers they mention.Fortunately it's a short book."
5,definitely recommended,"""Finding God in All Things: A companion to Spiritual Exercises..."" is excellent reding for both personal and professional use by a spiritual director."
5,"Quick read, but very thorough","This book is fantastic: It's a quick read, and not too academic, filled with clear explanations of the Ignatian path and insight into each of the retreat steps."
1,I got a wrong book,"I got a wrong book. I already read this book borrowed from my friend. It was very good. I wanted to keep it. I got refund, but I did not bother to reorder. Because I have already read it."
3,It's like getting inside a nine year-old girl's head,"Very unlike other works from this author (i.e. The Fermata and Vox), this story wonderfully reveals what goes on inside a nine year-old girl's head. I enjoyed the imagination, thoughtful perspectives, and overall light-heartedness. I also liked, many times, the last paragraph or sentence of a chapter, which had nothing to do with the incident in the chapter, just a summarizing thought that could have stood on its own. The one thing that bothered me about this book is that it is written in third person, but in a young girl's narrative voice. It made me wonder if the book was originally written in first person (Nory) and redone. I don't know what the point is in having a young girl's voice tell the story if it isn't Nory's own."
2,2 1/2* Too Long For Its Content,"Nicholson Baker is a very original writer, and he excels here at writing about a young girl's observations and fantasies in the third person. I thought he succeeded in this. The main problem is the lack of a plot: The myriad observations (divided into 54(!) short excerpts fail to advance a plot, although we do get deeper into Nory's head. It just gets very tedious after awhile.I would recommend this as a book from which to read excerpts, but Baker would have been better to write a shorter book, or to have some semblance of a plot. Although the style and characters are quite different, try ""Zazie Dans Le Metro"" for another, more interesting look at young female adolescense. It's offbeat. and ultimately, more satisfying."
1,Unreadable. Reached my asymptote at 66 pages,"While my only previous experience with Baker was with The Fermata, his writing was creative enough to interest me in this book written from a child's viewpoint. Hell, if Salman Rushdie could go from Midnight's Children to Haroun and the Sea of Stories, it seemed like Baker could put together an engaging enough story.However.What I found was the mind, not of a normal or even a creative 9 year old, but of a 9 year old with significant ADHD problems. Reading the story told from her point of view was a lot like being in the mind of someone with serious personality disorders, fragmented, hallucinogenic and otherwise pointless.Having sworn off my old habit of finishing books once I've started them, I put this one aside and called it 'abandoned'.I cannot recommend this book unless you've done a lot of acid and/or enjoy speaking to people that have done a lot of acid and are no longer really 'there'."

4,My inner child loved this book-my inner adult got bored.,"A feel-good book that just might take the reader back a simpler, if not less painful, time in his or her life. I especially enjoyed Nory's struggles to understand and triumph over the mysteries and trials of day to day life, and I appreciated seeing the world through the eyes a child who is creatively gifted, if not a natural-born scholar. However, there were far too many of Nory's made-up stories and fairy tales, which quickly became tedious. Also, I have become so used to frequent typos and misspellings in printed materials these days, apparently caused by the indiscriminate use of the spell checker, that at first I thought Nory's creative spellings were just the mark of an especially sloppy publisher!"
2,"Nothing new, despite the kid's view.","It seems like each book of Mr. Baker's sets out to push the limits of a genre or explore a new narrative form... ""Hey, novel-length intelligent phone sex!"" or ""Hey, the minutiae of lunch-hour thoughts!"" The problem is that in the execution of each of these ideas, he sticks tediously closely to his established strengths, and so all the books end up kind of the same despite their disparate subject matter.Nory makes up stories-- I'd like to see Nicholson try the same, without limiting himself to the abilities of a nine-year-old."
2,Where's the plot?,"I couldn't finish this book (and I always read books to the end), because it just doesn't go anywhere. Baker does a fine job of getting into the head of a 9 yr old girl but the story has no plot. The book put me to sleep."
2,"Hate to say it, but...","I would never want to bad-mouth Mr. Baker. I'm a huge fan of his, and have been since The Mezzanine. But I found Nory to be very vanilla and boring. He captures her world beautifully, and her voice, yes... but as in the life of a nine year-old, nothing happens. Insights are slight and far between. Hopefully this is just a palate-cleanser for his next work. (And let me throw in that I love Vox and like The Fermata.)"
2,A late-middle-age man imagines life as a nine-year-old girl,"A fan of Nicholson Baker, I was thoroughly disappointed by a book that I had looked forward to reading. Nine-year-old Nory relates to the reader her observations of her life to date. Although the dusk-jacket blurbs would lead the reader to believe that Nory's observations about her parents, her teachers and fellow children will leave the reader laughing out loud, I found that Nory's voice sounded very much like that belonging to a late-middle-age man working hard to imagine life as a nine-year-old girl. For Baker fans, skip this one."
2,This book belongs in the children's section...,"I kept waiting for some plot twist that would qualify this novel as ""adult fiction."" At the end of the 200-odd pages, I concluded that this book would be better marketed to older children or young adults. It reads very much like the notes I passed to my girlfriends in fourth grade. Fans of ""Vox"" and ""The Fermata"" will be disappointed."
1,NO LYRICS IN THIS CD,"This CD is just music like karaoke. Do not buy this if you think its her ""Greatest Hits"". I am getting my money back."
2,Warning: This is not Shania Twain!!,"I purchased this cd thinking it was a ""greatest hits"" collection of Shania Twain actually singing. But it's only a cover band, and it doesn't even have any lyrics. But, it does have some good guitar in it. So, just be warned that this is not actually Shania!"
1,This is a pure rip-off,"This is the MIDI song of every great song she has ever made. Please, help my soul, don't buy this! You will be sorry you did! I recommend Shania's CD, not the other people's who wish they were Shania Twain. If this is a tribute to her, then I wouldn't want to be her! Listen to real music, not re-made bull that sucks. I am disappointed in this CD, and I am sure if you buy it, you will be too. I thought I was getting a baragian, but if you bought ""Come On Over"" you are getting a great bargain! I waited at the edge of my seat for this, and here I got nothing in return!"
5,"absolut fantastic,we are longing for more of this music","my wife Anke placed an order to buy Shania Twain records the last time I was in Nashville, I have not heard about this lady before, I bought all I could get at Ernest Tubb's record shop, be sure I am Happy I did, I love this music, it is absolutely fantastic, you will be in a good mood when listening to her music, go ahead, we need more of this, a fan from Hamburg, Germany, Juergen Hanke"
1,Shania Twain Rules!,"If this were really Shania then of course, without question there'd be five stars showing. I'm one of the lucky two million that got to see her in concert, not once but three times! She's super. The last time I saw her I actually touched her! Tell me about it. I didn't wash my hand for a couple of days (at least) LOL..."
3,Not as good as expected,"Being a fan of Mr. Auchincloss, I found this less than satisfactory. His prose and conversations are beautiful, but I think he borrowed from Pamela Harriman's life too much. I wonder if she would see herself as Clara. There is also a bit of the Luce family in it. But it was a quick and enjoyable read."
3,A Pleasant Fable,"Mr. Auchincloss has written another novel of polished prose; so polished, it's hard to grasp the characters. The novel is set in the period that was the zenith for his dramatis personae - the 50's and 60's. Much of the action in this book is reminiscent of False Gods, an earlier novel about museums and foundations, and Diary of a Yuppie, told from the woman's point of view. The story of Clara, a siren and self made woman, the novel is clever, discerning, and wise, but lacks the vitality of some of his other works. As a summer novel, it's fine reading, and Mr. Auchincloss has an uncanny ability to get inside a woman's skull and look out at a world which will smile condescendingly at her skills and intelligence, and pat her on the head as a pretty little thing. A novel of manners, but a cautionary tale as well."
2,Dull portrait of a manipulating harpy,"This is the first Louis Auchincloss book I've read, and I'm not too eager to tackle a second. I hated Clara, the main character, from the start - a manipulating, merciless social climber who is also, and in loosely chronological order, a cheating wife, a bad mother, a gold digger, a disloyal employee, and a betrayer of a dead man's last wishes. There is not one redeeming quality in her, which would not be so bad if there were other, more endearing characters. But, apart from her gentle, weak-willed father (who features briefly at the beginning of the book), and her millionaire second husband (when in a generous mood), there are none. So this book ends up being no more than the chronicle of a nasty set's glamorous lifestyle and the smug, dull and self-satisfied recounting of a cold-hearted, thoroughly unpleasant woman's exploits and ultimate success. Not very heartlifting, is it? If at least it had been wonderfully written!"
5,"Awesome jacket, great price!","This jacket fit well, feels good, and has every feature I need! All this at a great price! Awesome! I would highly recommend this to all my friends."
4,Great Buy,"Awesome jacket and it is really well made. I never had a chance to try it because I messed up the size issue. I am returning it for the correct size, so far all is well on that front. But it seems like the correct jacket and is well made so can not wait for the correct size to be shipped back to me."
1,Ugh.,"This calendar isn't funny. It isn't witty. It isn't cute, clever, or even smart-alecky. It's just boring garbage.I bought several as gifts but returned them when I saw how lame it was."
4,Great for persistantly tense muscles in neck and shoulders,"I have had one of these for years, and it's great. This particular one can work for lower back problems, too, if you lie on your stomach. I frequently have one side or the other of my neck tense to the point of driving me crazy. I've seen an orthopedist, I've gotten a temurpedic pillow, I can't afford a masseuse... But precautions don't prevent my neck from being an infernal pain in the... right. This should help you cut down your ibuprofen intake.The moist heat element of this, absent in similar aromatherapy-type neck heating devices, is particularly helpful.The neck rest-type is a little less awkward for moving around while you're using it--at the moment, it looks like amazon only sells those in bulk, though.."
5,On the top with hip-hop ...,"You must listen to this if you haven't. And for those who haven't, get it now before it gets harder tommorrow. I actually found it in several places but it's out of press and would be harder to find by just a year pass by.All the songs are good, no doubt. And it's just not smooth, it's deep on the core, on the details. R.I.P. Subroc. And oh yea, a must have in the collection of MF Doom fans."
2,Disappointing followup to Mr. Hood,"This is a disappointing followup to their first album, Mr. Hood. Perhaps it has to do with the passing of Subroc, the break up of 3rd Bass, but this is simply not a good album"
2,"Keeps coffee warm, does nothing else well","You only a get a decent temperature reading if it happens to be completely full, rendering this product's ""extra"" feature fairly worthless for the average home consumer. Worst of all, it drips and spills all over the place after you pour a cup."
2,Pourer has design flaw,"My carafe also broke.. The red plastic button that you push has a design flaw. And when breaks you might as well throw it in the trash. Also, coffee collects in the lid at the red button.."
3,"Like it, but mine broke as well...","Love the carafe and have learned to pour it without dribbles... However after daily use for about 8 months the red button has stopped functioning correctly. It didn't break as the other reviewer commented, it just no longer works the plunger mechanism. No spare parts seem to be available, so we are looking for a replacement."
3,Red Tab breaks and only a mediocre job of keeping coffee hot,"We've had the Laroma 2.0Lt stainless steel 2.0L carafe for about two years and have had mixed feelings about the purchase. It only does a mediocre job of keeping the coffee hot for more then a few hours, the temp indicator only works well when carafe is full and not the red pour control tab has now broken. I'm now forced to look for a replacement and will not be purchasing this carafe again."
1,Doesn't have rose fragrence,This lotion is runny and smells awful. The high price makes it less than one star.
5,Nature's Way Licorice Root Capsules,This very effectively relieves indigestion for me and acts as a calming agent. This is something I buy on a regular basis.
4,Necessary Evil,"The program that I am in requires that I write all of my papers in this style, so I was forced to purchase the book. I do highly recommend the spiral format, as it is awfully easy to use."
2,Essentials...,"Good price, shipped promptly, what I expected... The book itself could use updating and an easier to use format for refrencing the correct refrences... I realize it's an essential but I'd much rather be doing anything else than having to use it! Still, if your looking at buying it, your probably going to need it."
3,Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (Fifth Edition,This book is o.k. but has way too much information for the average college student who just wants the bare basic facts to get through a writing assignment. It took longer to find the information I needed than it did to write the paper.I am glad that I chose the spiral format in that it is extremely easy to work with as opposed to the traditional bounded style book.For someone who plans on writing a lot of papers this book is a must.
1,Outdated,"This edition is out of date with respect to formatting. The 6th edition (2009) introduced major changes (title page, electronic references, etc.)"
