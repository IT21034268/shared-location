3,You people need expand your horizons!,"I don't listen to country or pop much, but I figured I would check this out since it is one of the the few recordings in history to sell over 10 million copies. The tunes were simple, sometimes catchy and the singing was average. Great marketing and a pretty face sold this recording. Ultimately, it is repetitive and not creative enough to be a great recording. The only other artist I have listened to in this genre is Bonnie Raitt and she is phenominal in comparison to this. Her band can groove hard and Bonnie's vocals are way more expressive. Search around if you like this and you will quickly find some much more interesting artists. Check out www.pandora.com."
2,......,"After this CD came out i bought it, and i listend to it for a while,why i don't know? it had some cathy songs, yes, it has some fun songs, sure, but i really hate her voice. at first it's fine to listen to her voice and she's a good songwriter and seem to have a great personality, that i'll give her, but in the longrun, her voice is very harsh on the ears... i suggest you listen through one of her cd BEFORE you buy it... cause her voice might not be as appealing to everyone..."
1,This don't impress me much,"After seeing the ""Man I Feel Like A Woman"" video, I lost total respect for Ms. Twain. She says she's country, but sorry Shania, YOU'RE NOT! These songs are clearly pop-NOT COUNTRY. Shania in her ""Woman"" video, clearly shows she can be 1st class hooker. Oh yeah Shania, your eye shawdow doesn't go all the way to your ears."
5,This thing still has life!,"The original album was very good and this one is just as good. Even though the songs are old, it doesn't matter for they still sound good and makes you feel good inside. The changes made are almost neglegable but it doesn't make you feel like you wasted your money on something you already had. And whoever says that this album is just played out is wrong as hell. The original release has been on the Billboard Top 20 albums for, as of now, 115 straight weeks."
5,I Am Waiting For the Next CD,"I first saw Shania on County Music Television - Video ""Any Man of Mine"" and I wondered who she was and having not listened to county for a long time I was immediately interested. Yes she was sexy, but refreshing. Woman In Me Was awesome and it's the latest one that sold my daughters (in their late 20's and granddaughters 6 & 9)Come on Over is empowering for women and catchy, My husband is a solid blues and rock fan but he likes Shania. It's too bad there are so many people that don't understand success and beauty when they see it. Some of the above critics go on for 2 - 3 paragraphs. Why? Look what she has done, how many albums she has sold and even gone international to boot. Society has a hard time with anything new and refreshing. Critics get over it and leave us die hard fans to enjoy the best that music has seen (in general)for a long time. Shania is a long lasting success,an icon and W E L O V E H E R! Get over it! Shania we love you here in B.C. Canada."
3,queen American country music?,"Keep cool man(or woman)---aspecially keep your brain (and ears)cool!Her music is nothing particular!Her voice and talend is quite normal. But all tracks are warm and ""pop""!So noncountry music fans can have one!"
2,"WHAT IS SHE SELLING, HER MUSIC, OR HER BODY?","Except for ""You're still the one"" (which is an awesome song) this album blows! Maybe if she didn't prance around like a hooker on stage, or act like she's so great, I'd like her more. Does she actually think she's country? Sounds more pop-ish than anything else on the radio!"
2,Shania is a traitor!,"Three or four years ago Shania was ranking high on country charts around the nation. She was a beautiful woman with a powerful voice. Shania used Country to get her start and then she went to the pop industry by singing songs that sound like so many others and by wearing as little clothing as possible. It is upsetting that looking as revealing as possible is what gets people to the top. I ranked her CD a 2, because her songs aren't all bad, but I do not personally respect her for the person she has become. She may still be topping country charts, but is she singing country? Compare her cd's."
2,Shania Just Doesnt Do It For Me,"I do not like this CD. I do not like pop music at all, and this is a mix of country and pop, that will leave you with a bitter after taste. She has talent, of course she does, she has sold alot of CD's, but she is just to market concious. I dont think an artist can maintain artistic integrity while just trying so despratley to please the masses. I liked Still The One, and that was all, and I only liked that one because she wasnt yelping or making hersefl look like an imbosile in her video clip. If you want quality country, get a Kasey Chambers CD."
2,WHAT HAPPENED,"First off i'm a 12 year old female who listens to everything from george jones to motley crue! i like all music, but my passion is country music! When i first listened to ""the woman in me"" i was IMPRESSED! so when shania's third album came out i bought hoping that i would feel the same!(not) considering it took for EVER to come out with a new cd the songs were NOT well written! as a song writer myself MY songs are better than hers and i'm only 12! maybe she should consider taking writing lessons from matraca berg or someone who has talent! maybe she would have been better off not breaking country's rules! with a few more albums like this she WON""T be around much longer! :)"
1,Ouch!,Hearing these tunes on the radio is a truly frustrating experience! This will be some of the stuff people laugh at when they look back on bad 90's music.
1,She's run out of gas on this one.,"Aside from You're Still The one, the songs on this album sound as if she wrote them in about 20 seconds. Honey, I'm Home is one of the most poorly written songs I've heard, along with That Don't Impress Me Much. I loved ""The Woman In Me"" album, but this one is terrible. Don't waste your money. Buy ""The Woman In Me"" instead."
1,SUCKS,"This CD is extremely irratating and just stupid. I HIGHLY advise you dont buy it, Ive heard it and It got old FAST..."
1,Very dissapointed! What's wrong with her!,"I bought her latest album a few days ago, because I've heard it has sold some copies, so I decided to test it out. I regret that! She's no good. All her songs sound the same. I saw a few of her videos, and thought what a bomber! She says she's country, but not anymore. She should just be trown into pop music, and be a disgusting person she is. Why should she even get credit for country music? Country to me is awesome artists like LeAnn Rimes, Faith Hill, Jo Dee Messina, Tim McGraw, and those kind of people. Sorry Shania, but you need to think a little more!"
4,THE NEXT SONG IS ALWAYS GREAT,"I AM NOT ONE FOR COUNTRY, HOWEVER THIS CD IS A FABULOUS VARITY OF DIFFERENT SOUNDS, FROM COUNTRY TO ROCK TO SOFT. I SPEND A LOT OF TIME TRAVELLING IN MY CAR, THIS ALWAYS KEEPS ME MOVING !"
5,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST CDS THAT I OWN!!,"When I got this cd, I instantly loved it! If you like a little country and some pop, THIS IS THE CD FOR YOU! I love this cd! All the songs are instant hits and I think that Shania Twain rocks this world! Her voice is wonderful!"
5,I like it!!!,"This is a really neat CD, with alot of my favorite Shania Twain songs. Her mix between pop and country I think is very unique.I ordered this CD used, from Ted Ross, and was very immpressed with it's great quality, and his great service."
2,Bubble Gum Pop,"Please don't make my review one that doesn't help you..it's my opinion and if you like Shania I know you'll put me on the no list but I'm a die hard country fan so give me some credit. Shania is what is wrong with country music today..I agree her songs are good for dance or pop stations but I don't agree with her being known as a country artist. I'm from her home here in Canada. Come on over is a great song and the album does have some good beats to it but frankly ""rock this country?"" come on, please. If you really wanna hear some great country music before Shania ""sold out"" go listen to her self title debut album. What made you say that is a great tune. Thanks for your time all....be wise in your buying :)"
1,"Fickle, unoriginal POP with a faint country influence","It's a damn shame everyone likes Shania Twain. Modern country music is horrible nowadays - it's all pop songs and nothing compared to legends like Johnny Cash and Patsy Cline. Shania Twain is one of the most bland artists you'll find anywhere.What you have here is a mix of pop songs with sleep-inducing arrangements and overwrought corny Def Leppard style power ballads like ""You're Still The One"" and ""From This Moment On"" that is unappealing and nauseating. The only reason Shania is played on country radio is because she wears a ten-gallon hat. Seems like that's all you have to do nowadays to get your song played there, since Shania's music doesn't sound anything like country.All you people who have been listening to Shania Twain and Garth Brooks all your lives don't know what you're missing out on. Check out some albums by Johnny Cash, Patsy Cline, Hank Williams Sr., Buck Owens, etc., and you'll forget this stuff ever existed."
5,awsome cd,"My best friend and I went to her concert with her dad for our b-day present. It was an outstanding performance. I love the song ""You're Still The One"". That has got to be my all time fav."
4,GREAT MUSIC,"Shania Twains cd is awesome. I really enjoy her music. I'm so glad I bought it. If you are looking for some great music with hip hop, country, and romance, you have just got to buy this cd. It's the best cd I have. Danielle, somewhere in CANADA"
4,Country with a little kick!,"Shania's second album, Come On Over, is great! A nice, refreshing kind of country with lots of energy and a little rock-n-roll. Her voice has an awesome sound to it and is great to listen to. One or two songs get old, but overall it's a CD you want to listen to over and over to."
4,Country Fans: This is Not Country,"Though these songs are remarkable and passionat and filled with emotion, it's not what people now refer to as ""country"". if you want to listen to country get ""The Woman In Me"". this album is excellent for Pop fans. I own this not beacause I'm a Contry Fan but beacuase I'm a Shania Twain fan. And, please DO NOT CALL THIS CD COUNTRY!"
3,Pretty Good Shania.,I think this album is very good. I rate it 3 stars because it could be an inch better.
3,Good but not her best,"Although commercially, ""Come On Over"" is Shania's most successful album, it just didn't hold me as well as ""The Woman in Me"" did. The crossover of counrty to pop in itself is good, the music is upbeat with just enough twang to go on Top 40 and Country stations. However her lyrics don't grab you as much as those on ""The Woman in Me"". I just saw her in concert with Leahy and it was excellent. I would like to see her work with Leahy on her next album."
5,I LOVE YOU!!,YOU ARE SO COOL! YOUR CDS ROCK!!! YOU ARE A BEAUTIFUL GIRL BECAUSE YOUR MUSIC IS SO BEAUTIFUL.
5,THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM EVER!,"Yeahhhhhhh ! this is the best album ever. I bought 6 copies of this album in 3 years. You wont believe it but its true. Since I saw her for the first time live, in the GRAMMYS IN 1999 I fall in love with her, shes simply amazing. And Im crazy about the NEW ALBUM UP! UP! that realeses in NOVEMBER 19TH .............. so..... YOU HAVE TO BUY IT......"
3,This is album just ok!!!!!,"I thought this album was ok. I enjoyed a few songs, but was mainly disappointed. Sample it before you buy it!"
4,Shania's journey to superstardom starts here.,"Shania Twain's journey to superstardom starts with her third album COME ON OVER. Like Kenny Rogers and the late Eddie Rabbitt,she went pop here. This album opens with MAN! I FEEL LIKE A WOMAN which Shania considers her personal anthem for her female fans. I love IF YOU WANNA TOUCH HER,ASK!,THAT DON'T IMPRESS ME MUCH and the love ballads FROM THIS MOMENT ON and YOU'RE STILL THE ONE. Shania performed YOU'RE STILL THE ONE at a televised concert in Miami as a duet with Elton John. Another duet they both did was Elton's SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY YOU LOOK TONIGHT. With this album,Shania became popular in nightclubs. The same thing would happen shortly later with Faith Hill's BREATHE. This woman is so damn beautiful. She is so sexy also. The kind of woman that Howard Stern would call a ""piece of ass""."
1,Definitely Not Country,"What a big disappointment! I liked her first two cds a lot, but this one is terrible. This is a pop album not country. She sold out, just like many so called ""country"" artist today. Listen to Terri Clark, at least she still sounds country."
2,Slightly disappointed,"Many country fans have written negative reviews, saying that Shania has gone too ""pop"" for their tastes. I am a fan of both country and pop, and I was still not taken by Come On Over. ""You've Got a Way"" is beautiful because of its simplicity and delicacy. The title track is perfect when you're feeling run-down and you need a lite pick-me-up. Other than that, while Shania performed well throughout the album, I did not like the songs themselves. I find ""Honey, I'm Home"" to be particularly annoying. The lyrics make me cringe: ""...Rub my feet. Give me something to eat. Fix me up my favorite treat....Give the dog a bone. Honey I'm home."" The fast songs have a good beat, but the content is often shallow and grows tired after repeated listens. It reaches the point of being irritating. Come On Over is more sizzle than steak. Try The Woman in Me; there's much more feeling behind it."
2,Mediocre Def Leppardish riffs with overprocessed country!,"This CD is only good after three listens. The lyrical content is very shallow and baseless. The Woman In Me was great, but was dearly disappointed with this. I compare it to leaving the bottle cap of the soda opened too long: it goes stale.When a CD gets this kind of hype and have no content, we all know it is a fad and in five years will be forgotten.""Honey, I'm Home"" gets grating on the ears. The song doesn't even try to stay county, except with some synthesized fiddles. And the ""remix"" CD, if you can call it that is even worse. Shania has sold out to become a part of the pop world.I only like ""You're Still The One"" and ""From This Moment On"". Shania should go back to her country roots and give up this pop trip of hers.I can't wait to see real country back because this ""New Country"" is starting to sound more like mainstream pop."
1,BLACK hip-hop loving girl drawn to COUNTRY because of SHANIA,"Sike. she's great. i knew one star would grab attention more than five stars because one star is so unexpected when dealing with such a talented woman. i love all types of music. however i was drawn to country music because of shania and dina (did is shave my legs for this) carter. since buying their music about 2 or 3 years ago, i've ventured out and brought other country abums over the years like garth, brooks and dunn, faith, and dixie chicks. i encourage all lovers of country music to be different and venture out like how i did and explore all types of music. shania is bad!! thanks to her i am no longer closed mind and have an appreciation of all types of music"
4,I hate country--but here's Shania!,"I never liked Country, but Shania Twain is changing the face of it forever! I Love how she twists country into pop. It's great. this Cd is worth it to buy. Your Still The One, Come On Over, From This Moment On, Man! I Feel Like A Woman! and That Don't Impress Me Much are the highlights. I wish she would come out with a new CD though. Overall, it is still a little too country for me. but still an excellent buy."
4,Not Quite as Good as The Woman In Me,"I like ""Come on Over"", but not as much as I like ""The Woman in Me"" which is one of my All-Time Favorite Albums. Don't get me wrong, ""Come On Over"" is a very good compilation of pop music, and you'll enjoy it if you buy it. It's just not as good as her previous effort in my opinion."
4,The Shania and Mutt show goes on,"It is a well-known fact that Shania and Mutt write and produce the majority of the material she performs. Come On Over is no exception.I personally love Shania's ballads. ""You're Still the One"", ""From This Moment"" (with Bryan White), and ""You've Got A Way"" are all great cuddle songs.I like to pop the CD in my car and roll the windows down for the first four cuts, they are all upbeat, very singable songs, as are ""Honey I'm Home"", ""That Don't Impress Me Much"", and ""Rock This Country"".Come On Over is good, a little over-produced at times, but Shania's powerful voice shines through."
5,Most Eccellent!,"Five stars! Fabulous! All the trax on this album are top-notch, best quality, 100% SHANIA. I would definetly reccomend this to any music lover. Hats Off to Shania for this terrific accomplishment!"
3,"Catchy, quality versions of Come On Over","I don't know why so many people are complaining about this version of Come On Over. After all, these are the hit versions of the album, which is great for people like me who don't go for the traditional country sound and prefer something more pop oriented. Very likable catchy songs, except Jeff Lange (producer) borrows too much from his Def Leppard past: ""Honey I'm Home"" sounds like ""Pour Some Sugar On Me""."
3,Doesn't impress me enough,"Shania sings like an angel, her voice constantly reminds me of Karen Carpenter. There are pretty damn good songs (""You're Still The One"", ""Man! I Feel Like A Woman!"") but also lots of unfinished material. And that's a shame!"
5,"Finger-poppin, hip shakin, feel good music",My friend loaned her CD to me and I fell in love with it. The tunes keep playing in my head. This is the type of music that makes you want to get up and dance and have a good time. Its hard to feel down when this music is pumping. Her ballads are beautiful.
1,"If I could, I would vote it 0!!!!!","I totally agree with shgeal02@willy.wsc.edu.....Shania Twain is a piece of trash! She plants her toes on stage in a skin-tight leather suit, and sings the most stupidest songs in the world! Just think abuot it! Man. I feel like a woman.. Feel the vibration? Can you spell D-U-M-B? I know I can! Dumb = Shania Twain and the Dixie CHicks! All country music for that matter!!!!! POOP!!!"
3,WARNING The songs on the radio are not the same as the CD,We bought this CD because of the sample songs we heard on the radio... we were disapointed by the difference of the country tone that the CD has that the songs on the radio do not have.
2,How Does She Do It????,"I just wanna' know how this chick manages to look so darn perfect all the time?! Oh, her music's OK, too."
2,some songs okay but most lyrics could be written by toddler,i bought the cd - MY FIRST _ for 'still the one' and 'don't be stupid' but it's the lyrics that are stupid.
2,"Trite, cheesy, but catchy.","Summary says it all. From a woman who cannot be seen in public without almost totally exposing her body, that should be a clue. She has an awesome body but her talent is indirectly proportional to her looks. However, there are some catchy songs (You're Still The One, From this Moment On, That Don't Impress Me Much) on this disc which even the most cynical music fan would find themselves humming to."
2,Not country music ...,"It's a shame when so many artists jump south of the border and jump on the pop bandwagon - and I think Shania can safely be placed in this category. Her latest album feels less like a country album and more like a carefully orchestrated pop album - much in the same foray as artists like Alanis Morrisette. It is not the country music I would expect to hear from a Timmins girl, nor is it country music by any traditional definition. ""New"" country is a rehash of the same stuff the Eagles have been playing for the last 20 years - and it's wearing thin."
5,Shania has done it again!,"No one thought she could follow the ""woman in me"" cd with one to match it success. Well looks like she's gonna beat it! Shania has a great talent. She has the voice of an angel, and she can write some of the best songs I've ever heard. Some people say that the lyrics are stupid, and silly. She writes songs about serious matters, but adds a little humor to them...people are so uptight these days! This a great cd to listen to while your on the road. Has great upbeat songs, with sing-a-long lyrics. One of the few true musicians in music today! Country or Pop...who cares!! Just great music!!"
5,Awesome!,"Not a better CD (country or otherwise) in a long time. If you don't like country and are more in tune with pop, you may just begin to love country with this album."
4,A wonderful surprise..especially since I dont like country,"This cd is quite good. I have to hide it of course because it doesnt fair well to my image of not liking country music. (just kidding) I bought it mainly because of two of the songs that I love, (You're Still the One and You've got a way) It took me awhile to get into the rest of it but it happened in a short period of time. Shania really does cross over and appeal to other listeners, not just country."
4,GUILTY PLEASURE,"Personally,I never could stand country. I'm amazed that I even like this. This CD contains some of '98 and '99's best songs such as ""From This Moment"",""You're Still the One,""and the beautiful ""You've Got a Way."" It's one of the best-selling CDs by a female artist of all time so don't miss out!"
3,Not what I thought it would be...,"Her songs lack depth and emotion. The song ""Black Eyes, Blue Tears"" deals with a very important issue, but it didn't exactly move me to tears. All of her songs sound about the same and the lyrics are pointless. It's hard to make out what she's saying at times. It's an okay CD...but definatly not my fav."
2,"Disappointing, given her past success","Shania, no one's denying that you're talented. I enjoyed The Woman In Me, but this new radio-friendly junk is beneath someone of your capabilities. Get some intelligent lyrics, and knock off all that talking over the songs. You have a lovely voice, just use it! I'll add another star here based on the appeal of Still The One, and maybe even From This Moment (although I have to say the duet with Bryan White is far superior to the solo version) except for those two songs, you need to go back to the drawing board. Also, you're beautiful without having to expose yourself. Leave something to the imagination. And return to your country roots, before it's too late!"
5,Great,I just got this CD a few days ago and I can't stop listening to it. Shania Twain definitely has spunk and an incredible amount of liveliness in her music. The one thing that confused me was why Bryan White wasn't in the single version of this From this moment on. If anybody knows please send me an email.
5,Excellent sound and it keep you going,"Enjoy both the energy and the sound. A new Rock-n style for country, but long overdue. A change from the twanging that comes out of country."
5,"Shania, You've got a Way!","Every single song on this album is soo good! My most favorite one would have to be ""Honey, I'm Home!"" This album deserves more than 5 stars."
1,overrated&overplayed,what is so special about Shania Twain? she is a country Jennifer Lopez.all hype and no talent.Lee ann Rimes is a better vocalist but when she tried to go pop all Hell broke out.Shania is pop.her songs and material have more in common with celine dion than Patsy Cline.that don't impress me much is as pop as addicted to Love.she is great at marketing but her music has no roots.Still the one was catchy as is the case with some of her other material but considering her overall impact she is way overrated&overplayed.
2,I hate to knock a fellow Canadian but...,"Although this album is musically enjoyable the lyrics are juvenille to the extreme. It is amazing that an album with lyrics so childlike, that it seems that they were written by a fourteen year old girl, has sold so many millions of copies. I guess intelligent lyrics are no longer important as long as the melody is catchy. All the same I am happy with the success of all our Canadian artists. I must admit I was a bit put off by her deliberate lies about her heritage. Did she really believe that proclaiming herself an aboriginal Canadian would further her career?"
1,another attempt to strech this album out,Now at the begining when the original come on over was released it was a good album but come on enough is enough. Its time for a new album. This album has no more life left.
5,here is a piece of my mined,"Ok if you don't like her; shut up and get over it you have no right to pass judge on any one you very imature and you need to get over it.I never considered listening to country; i like korn ,kmfdm ,and,tool but i lke her music ok well i am done ,f**kers. bye!"
2,she's a doll but her music is awful,"she's lucky she's such a fox, that's all i have to say. no way an average looking person gets away with songs like ""Man! I Feel Like a Woman."" I gave her a 5 for looks and a negative 1 for music, weighted equally that comes out to 2 stars."
2,"If this is country, I'm Grandpa Jones",And I'm not. This is not a country music record. It is a pop record. She is about as country as Britney Spears or the Spice Girls. Yuch.
2,Listen to the Radio!,This CD is not worth the money! The fun and upbeat songs that I heard on the radio and liked are not worth the money for the whole CD. If you haven't heard the rest of the songs then don't bother. Her irritating bark and yipping and pathetic lyrics get old after about two listens. I like pop and true country and this CD isn't near the top of either lists.
4,An excellent blend of styles,"In this CD, Shania Twain shows an excellent blend of pop and country. Fans of all kinds of music will like this. Some of the songs, like ""From this moment on"" with Brian White, drag on a bit and are a bit too sentimental, but overall, this is a great album to dance to! ""Man! I feel like a woman"" is my personal fave!"
5,"The best of the 3 versions...... America, Europe, Aussi","This remade version is the BEST!!! With the remade songs and the dance mix of ""That Don't Impress Me Much"", it just donesn't get any better than this. Plus it comes with the bonus CD including the 2 live versions (one of which is the medley of the 3 songs the way she performs it in concert!) This is a must have for all Shania fans!!!!"
5,Un disco excelente,"Esta es la producción que lanzó al estrellato a Shania, claro, su camino andado la llevó a tener un disco de esta calidad.Las versiones que hay en Come On Over [international] son muy especiales y tienen sonidos que cambian en comparación con las otras versiones que hay.Simplemente recomendable al 100%"
4,"Wow, I guess country music isn't really that bad!","I like many different types of music (new age, rock, jazz and pop), but never have liked country. I got this CD because of one song and that was From This Moment On, but I thoroughly enjoy the entire CD. I strongly recommend this to anyone who likes a good beat and has a soft heart."
5,"Girly or Not, I Really Like This Record","This is Shania Twain's best record. At least I think so. No matter what you listen to -- rock, blues, R & B, Jazz, whatever -- this is an album you're sure to enjoy, even though it's exceptionally girly, but what can I say, she's a wonderful singer and she really shows what a girl can do. This album can get you syked and pumped for any and everything and match any of your moods. Women go through many different experiences and these songs really nail them."
3,Come on Over CD,"Most of CD plays great, case in good shape. Track 1 skips horribly and am not pleased with that since its my favorite song. Overall, pleased with purchase."
4,MusicLover,Bought this for my sister as a birthday present. I was very pleased with how fast the product was shipped. This is a throwback album. I'm glad I was able to find it here. My sister absolutely loved it. Thanks!
3,From This Moment On,My Favorite Song is From This Moment On w/Bryan White. They are VERY Talented. I hope she stays in country music.
1,I wish it was better,"I have really gotten into Roy Wood again lately thanks to getting a CD version of MUSTARD. MAIN STREET turned out to be a great surprise that should have been released when it was originally ready. However, STARTING UP is a different kettle of fish.It is extremely dated with its 80's production, approach and sound. It was a pretty painful listening experience for me and being a big Roy Wood fan (and huge ELO/Move fan) it pains me to say that. There's not much I would want to listen to again. I have heard comparisons to McCartney's PRESS TO PLAY and the Stones' DIRTY WORK (haven't heard it), but it mostly makes me sad listening to this CD. Press to Play is not one of my favorite Macca albums, but it's great compared to this.I can only recommend this for the Roy Wood completist and even then don't say you weren't warned."
3,Not the best Roy Album,"Everybody who is a Roy Wood fan is because of the beautiful 60's and 70's tunes with The Move, Wizzard, ELO and solo. This album is very different compared with some other Roy solo albums like Mustard or Boulders.This album has an 80's style so it's a different Roy Wood style. But there are beautiful songs like Ships in the Night and Raining in the city."
4,"The book that got me ""hooked"" on Richthofen!!","I discovered this book in a public library several years ago and it opened up an incredible world for me. Since then, my fascination with the Red Baron and WWI aviation in general has increased tremendously. It is still my favorite Richthofen book because of the way the material is handled and the way he draws you in to Richthofen's world. I would definitely reccommend it to anyone interested in the Red Baron."
4,Charactors,"The Charactors are so addicting . They are so real life in all the Loon Lake Series. Great story line, hard to figure out the who done it or where is this going next , yet still feel like they are all the people next door."
2,too many convenient coincidences,This book had way too many convenient coincidences that were required to make the story work. It also had the most unbelievable police procedures that I have ever seen in a novel. They were just too hard to accept.
4,memories of wisconsin,"I enjoyed this book very much. I spent my summers in this part of the northwoods of wisconsin and the author did a great job of painting a picture of the area.I found myself really getting to know the main characters, always a good thing in my book (!)."
2,Need to be a fisherman,I skipped over much of the book because so much is about fishing which does not interest me. The charecters in the book are quite interesting.
5,Nostalgic,"""Dead Water"" is so enjoyable because it is set (fictional) in the area in which I grew up and the names (fictional) remind me of life in a small town and the surrounding area. It is such an enjoyable read along with the other seven ""Dead ...."" books in the series written by Victoria Houston. I look forward to the next edition."
3,stiletto2,"I had sirius built into my car stereo, and an old portable sportster I used in my other vehicle with a car kit. I had 2 home docking stations in the house, but I could turn on any radio in the house or listen with a portable FM radio outside up to 50 yards away(cutting the lawn). The stiletto barely sends a signal 5 feet. My clock radio doesn't have input jacks so I mounted a car kit stand on top of it and used the transformer plug from the home kit to power it. Outside It worked great on the beach in northern Wisconsin and in the virgin islands. I wear it walking and the signal is great unless the canopy of trees is very close on both sides. The headphones are a pain, but I got used to it."
2,S10 does NOT!! play MP3s,"As I pretty much agree with everything that has already been said - expect for the wacko that gave this 4 stars - I just wanted to add that the S10 does NOT play MP3s.Now, I admittedly should have figured this out before I purchased the device but my research consisted of only reading these reviews. As my main reason for purchasing was a cross-country drive, I figured the headphones and non-automobile reception problems wouldn't be an issue for me and I would use the device as my MP3 player.The S100 is $100 more expensive than the S10 - as an MP3 only player currently costs, what, like $20? - I assumed the price differential was tied to assorted other useless features as in the iPod line-up."
1,Shipping was not in a timely manner,I paid for over night shipping and did not receive it until the following week. I do not want to pay over 20 dollars and not receive my mp3 player in the time I paid for. Because of bad service I was not able to enjoy my anniversary. I would like to receive my money back for shipping and only then would I consider shopping with you again!
1,Huge Disappointment,"First of all, the programming offered by Sirius is the absolute best. I couldn't wait to get this home and try it out. However, there are some huge limitations of this device:1. Unless you live in a major city that happens to have a satellite repeater to rebroadcast the signal (New York), you cannot get any service. At my house 20 mins outside of Pittsburgh, PA, I can only get a signal if I stand directly in front of a window.2. It comes with a set of satellite headphones that are so uncomfortable, they should be used to torture captured terrorists with. Unwearable.3. I figured that at least I would be able to use this thing to store MP3s on. However, with their provided software, you cannot store MP3s on this thing - they want you to move up to the 100.So, unless you want to stand outside in your front yard in the middle of winter to hear satellite radio, there's no benefit of this device at all."
1,Incomprehensibly Pointless,"I found this product to be profoundly useless. The headphones which are apparently mandatory to get *any* kind of signal are unbearably uncomfortable. You must also be *outside*, so I had to sit in my yard in the winter to listen to the radio and even then only managed occasional snippets of broken up audio.Stick with terrestrial radio - it works!One other alternative - use an mp3 player and get into podcasts."
1,"No Fuss, No Muss Satelite Radio?!?!?! Um, No.","I LOVE Sirius radio, and I paid well for this because I thought it was supposed to be a high-speed, low-drag way to get it. It is not. The antenna headphones are pretty good at getting signal, much better than the antennas that come with the Sportster, but they are bulky and uncomfortable. If you want to use it in the car, or as anything but a Walkman, you have to buy seperate kits (another $100 after the $195 I'd already paid). And the car kit is, well...See my review there. For here, lets just say don't plan to use it in the car. So, to sum up, Sirius satellite radio...Excellent content in terms of music, talk and news. Getting satellite radio signal? A pain in the behind."
4,Best Radio on Radio,"I've had Sirius in home and car for about two years, and I got this portable to make a contract job a little less boring. I've used both my Shure 3 and Sennheiser P100 headphones, and put the Sirius antenna headphones in a window. The signal has been superb, as has the sound quality. The hookups for the two headphones are different, so there's no problem there. It has been a wonderful investment."
1,A Big Let-Down,"I'm not the type to generally review products, but the Sirius S10 was so remarkably bad, that I thought the least I could do was add my two cents here for other potential buyers. What the other reviewers say about the earphones and signal issues is absolutely correct---I cannot conceive what value a ""portable"" satellite receiver has that is virtually incapable of receiving any signal, and then when it does, loses it if you happen to move the wrong way. Unless you plan on installing an outside antenna and using the device for stationary listening, you're much better off with a standard MP3 player that includes an FM receiver."
1,Stiletto buyers- please READ THIS,Read all the reviews here before you buy a Stiletto because there is a 100% chance that; A.)The supplied antenae headphones cannot be worn for more than a few minutes without your ears beginning to blead.B.)You cannot move while wearing said earphones or they flip down and off your head due to their top heavy design (the antenae on the top).C.)Receiving a signal in any other location other than a wide open treeless prairie...while standing exactly still will be a rare occurance. If you do get a signal it will dissappear in a few seconds. Even glass is enough of a barrier to impede the signal.O T H E R W I S EIt works great in your car w/car kit or at home with your home kit and of course you can record Sirius programing which is nice but I really wanted the portability and this just doesnt do it. You certainly cant jog with the headphones on and you cant ski either because no signal can get through a hat or helmet!
5,One of the best in the series,"Before reading this volume, I knew very little about the battles for Scandinavia during WWII. I found these stories to be some of the best in the whole series. Included are the usual Time-Life collection of hundreds of photographs, illustrations, artwork, and maps that supplement clear and interesting narratives."
3,Handle,"Have used commercial mop system for years....3 dogs...old one broke and I thought this Rubbermaid handle looked ergonomic....will go back to straight handle next time...somehow the handle is twisted after use and I can't get it straight...buy the straight handle, but great mop system....I have a couple dozen Velcro commercial pads I found at a discount store years ago....they last forever."
3,Prolife,"I did not realize I was getting a handle that curved and I understood the handle extended. I would prefer a straight handle. Overall, I'm adjusting to the curved handle."
4,Extremely well done!,"I have followed Nina Hagens music for almost two decades, and I must admit that this is one of the best compilations yet. The manner in which the album is structured is almost ethereal. Unrealistic. But solid, and with its feet firmly planted on the ground. It gave me the sensation that life is but a dream, and then you wake up."
3,Not really the best of,"I really like Nina Hagen's music. At its best it can be both passionately sincere, and bitingly sarcastic at the same time. But theNunsexmonkrockCD with its 4 bonus tracks (not on the original vinyl release) comes much closer to being the best of her music than this retrospective. Six of the best tracks on Abductions are also on Nunsexmonkrock. Of the remaining 8 tracks on Abductions, 3 are versions of ""Zarah"", not one of her best songs, and 1 (""My Way"") is just a joke (OK, a pretty good joke). Whereas of the remaining 8 numbers on Nunsexmonkrock, all except ""Superboy"" are as good as or better than anything on Abductions. If I were to pick my favourite tracks from each of the albums Abductions samples, none of them are actually on Abductions!"
2,I... I can't begin to describe this disc...,"Let's get this out of the way first thing -- this CD is atrociously bad. My friend suggested that I pick it up, which I did, and, well, I'm completely flabbergasted. And [angry] that i wasted [money] at a used music store. It's stupid, disposable German new-wave pop. I can't fathom why everyone keeps referring to this woman as a punk pioneer. If she ever was, this album provides no clues. My advice is to download the song ""New York New York"" for the humor value (come on, ""New York is der hahttest place for a honeymoon in a hodel ryeum""?) and stay the hell away from the rest of her work forever."
5,What a find!,"I don't know if finding this at the dollar store is good or bad overall... definitely added to its charm. Either way, this is a great book: just enough pop-culture refs (Thelma & Louise, Elvis,..) and southwestern kitsch without overdoing it, while still having something genuine to say undermeath. The Warhol-esque illustrations are great. Great for all ages (read : not just acceptable, GREAT)"
3,The Deer Leap,"I am very much a fan of Martha Grimes; but in this offering, she loses the battle when trying to balance her sparkling, dry humor and an almost depressing sullenness. I don't want to ruin the book for anyone, but the ending leaves us completely drained emotionally. I am a big fan of Ms. Grimes and have read most of the Jury novels. I am not one to always expect a ""storybook"" ending; but the resolution of this one is decidedly dark (even Melrose Plant does something totally out of character). I would rate this the weakest entry of the 10 or so that I have read so far, although it is still superior to most current books of the same genre.My advice is not to read this one if you are feeling blue and want a pick me up!"
3,"Not the best of the series, but worth a read","I am a great fan of Ms. Grimes' Richard Jury series, but I must say this is my least favorite of the bunch. I guess my only real reservation is the graphic descriptions of how animals are abused and killed by the most sadistic of predators: Man.Plot-wise, ""The Deer Leap"" is a worthy as any book in the series."
3,"Poignant, unfinished story","This is one of Martha Grimes' early Richard Jury novels, where some of the characters are almost stereotypical and not quite real--sometimes these early novels seem to me to be played out against cardboard sets in my mind. Despite this, this is a poignant, rather unfinished story about a child who seems to belong to no one and have no past and has given herself to protecting animals. Not even Richard Jury is able to protect Carrie Flood, and this is parinfully sad.One of the fun things about this novel is the introduction of Carole-ann, definitely a mutilayered character, and to see the development of Mrs. Wasserman."
5,Mr Standfast,"Buchan is always good reading - it goes fast and easy. But be sure to read his first spy novel ""The 39 Steps."""
4,Entertaining golden age mystery,"Daly's amateur detective Henry Gamadge is hired by a once-great, now not-so-much, New York family to save them from what they think is a plot to divest them of their inheritance.As always, Daly's writing is easy to follow, and this plot is very interesting, with a hint of something unnatural going on behind the scenes (not quite supernatural, but vaguely so.) The book also introduces us and Henry to his future bride, Clara."
5,Germans at thier best,I heard the song Boom Boom back in 82 on a Radio station called Pittsburghs Heartbeat WYDD. Not many people I knew listened it. They played lots of music that you wouldnt hear anywhere else in the area. Bands like Ice House and B. E. Taylor and of course Trio. Boom Boom was the only song I heard at that time. I rushed out to buy the cassette. I found a few of the songs to be outstanding. Then the tape got lost. I tried to locate it in stores but it was out of print. Thank god for Volkswagon! The album is really good. My favorite is still Boom Boom followed by Hearts are Trump. Now if some ad campaign would revive Madame X.
4,it's catchy and fun,"There's nothing deep and meaningful in this collection of songs. It's just fun. The simplicity of it all just smacks you silly. Somehow, it just grabs you and brings a smile to your face.Obviously, the ""Da Da Da"" song will forever be the one song that immortalizes Trio. But, there are other great songs on this CD - ""Boom Boom,"" ""Hearts are Trump,"" and ""Sunday You Need Love Monday Be Alone.""It's a lot of fun.""Let me in. Let me out."""
4,VW Theme Song,"This album is a must-have CD for any Volkswagen owner just because of the title song, ""Da Da Da""."
2,"Decent book, but you can do better","When I first received the Great Tiki Drink Book as a present, I was quite happy. The recipes were good and had a lot of variety. But as I used it I noticed the lack of attention to detail. Trying to follow along with a recipe is an exercise in frustration because the book isn't spiral bound so it won't lie flat and stay open to a particular page; the appendix make some attempt at helping you find certain ingredients, but doesn't do a very good job. I've since acquired several more Tiki Drink books and would recommend the Beachbum Berry books as superior to this one. The recipes are better researched and the form factor is much more conducive to trying out a new recipe while standing at the bar with liquor bottles in your hand."
5,"Make mine a double, please.","You can be the first in YOUR neighborhood to jump on the Tiki revival with this mouthwatering slim-jim book packed with delicious sounding (and looking) Tiki drinks and nibbly go-withs. The beauty of the recipes is that they are somewhat adapted to modern taste-- not too sweet and using ingredients (like lemongrass) that our Tiki forbears probably never heard of. There are recipes for quick sour mixes, an easy and inteteresting rum glossary, tiki lore (answers just what IS tiki anyways?), great graphics and photos. Also an excellent source list for All Things Tiki. The book is fun without being condescending. Well worth the affordable ticket."
2,contrived story - good acting in the buff,Save you money boys and girls....watch Max at night for a better show and more nudity. What ever happened to the gal (with the fancy car) that rang the door bell? I wonder who are the people that finance this junk?
2,"Pedestrian, Lifeless and Repetitive","Ok, Skynyrd fans; get out your knives!!! The dirty secret about this band is that they really weren't that great of a live act. Yes, you heard me right! If you add up several factors(1-crappy Peavey amps 2-Exhaustion from too many years of ridiculous touring schedules 3-playing the songs ""like the record"" with no room for spontaneity or creativity 4-Artimus Pyle is a weak timekeeper on the drums)and throw in horrible production from Tom Dowd(the most overrated and bad producer of that era; he also ruined Cream),this is the weakest of the Skynyrd albums. The best live recordings are to be found on the Collectibles disc from a '73 radio show. If you must have it, search around for a cheap copy in your favorite used disc store. Me, I'm gonna go put on Nuthin' Fancy (their best) and TURN IT UP..............."
4,This could have been the Best,"First off, this is worth buying just because of the rarity of a live performance. This is one of the best live rock bands to ever pour whiskey on stage (more on that later). These guys were the warmup band for The Who until The Who noticed that people were leaving before they came on. Flat out, one of the alltime American rock bands. They cover some songs on this album that are not on any studio albums. What is disappointing is that this could have been even better. The sound mix sounds like the guy mixing it got far too loaded as the concert went on, and the mix gets worse as it goes along. In addition, the band got completely [drunk], and as the concert goes on, their playing suffers. At one point, Van Zant can't remember the words to a song, and you can hear one of the backup singers say ""Whiskey, Baby"". It's still a great album, but so disappointing that they were not at their best due to pouring down a few hundred gallons of booze."
4,Good buy,I bought this CD for my boyfriend as a Valentine's Day gift. He is a Lynyrd Skynyrd fan and seems to really be enjoying it.
1,Not the suspenseful novel it appears to be,"After reading other authors, namely Clive Cussler, John Grisham and James Patterson, I guess I was expecting a little more from this author. Was told that she was a good suspense 'read'. It was all I could do to finish the book! Detailed, yes, if you like 'fashion' detailed ad nauseum, whether it was what the corpse was wearing or every other character in the story. Suspense? Only the last few chapters, when the author FINALLY started to pull everything together. As far as 'couldn't put it down' ... didn't happen. I would get bored with the story line and go find other things to do. After a day or two, I would pick up the book to read again. I was going to finish the book! ...even if it killed me..... :~)"
4,Suspense in While My Pretty One Sleeps,"This 318 page book keeps the reader guessing "" Who done it?"" until the very end of the novel . While My Pretty One Sleeps is about a fashion designer named Neeve Kearny who is in search of her mother's killer. With the help of Ethel Lambston's nephew, Jack Cambell whose aunt is also killed, the two solve the crimes. A long the way they discover several suspects ranging from Nick Sepetti, who was member of a mafia family to Seamus Lambston, the husband of the latest murdered victim. This book was an interesting suspense thriller."
4,While My Pretty One Sleeps,"Neeve Kearny is the heroine of this suspenseful novel as she tries to figure out what happened to Ethel Lambston, a gossip columnist who is one of her customers. Unfortunately, no one seems to care that she is dead! Neeve is deteremined to find the murderer and the murderer is determined to keep Ethel's death a mystery! This book is definitely a page turner."
4,While My Pretty One Sleeps,While My Pretty One Sleeps The book was exciting and I didn't want to put it down until I was done reading it! I would recommend it to others!
4,Page-Turner,Mary Higgins Clark always keeps the reader wondering what's next. I enjoyed this book and always can't wait to read the next book.
4,does journalism kill,"Ethel Lambston's body was found. The main suspects for the murder are: Douglas Brown, her nephew who will get all her money if she dies (she is rich), and her ex-husband, Seamus Lambston who has been giving her alimony checks ever since the divorce. All the clues point to both the suspects.When Neeve's mother was killed, her family thought it was Nicky Spetti, but when Ethel's throat is the same as the one on her mother's neck, Neeve thinks otherwise.I liked this book a lot. There were three suspects, and you never know who did it until the last four pages. It was a page-turner.I read tons of books than this one. In the others you normally find out who killed the person in the middle, but then you have to find the person. In this one you find out in the last pages, and the person is right there."
5,FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I've real all of her books, and as always, this one is soooooooooooooooo good!!! If you don't read Mary Higgins Clark, you have no idea what you are missing!!!"
4,Full of twists and well written,"The Climax never ended for me! Page after Page, I stayed on edge and could NOT put the book down. Mary Higgins-Clark is well spoken and got the point through to me as NO other writer could! I reccomend this book to anyone who is into suspenseful and mind boggling novels!I look forward to reading more of her novels!"
4,Another winner in the Alex Delaware series !,"Johnathan Kellerman has hit it on the head, once again, in ""The Web"", another in the Alex Delaware series. Dr. Alex Delaware is a noted child psychologist with a habit for attracting the most dangerous and mysterious cases. This time he - along with his lover Robin Castagna - are on the tropical island of Aruk so that Alex can help an American scientist assemble reference material from his former cases. The object is to write a book or a formal paper, but instead Alex finds himself caught in the middle of yet another strange situation - the apparent copycat of a savage murder that took place on the island years ago. Can Alex find out the truth before the killer finds him ?This was yet another great book from Johnathan Kellerman. The characters are so real, and the situation so believable, that I just couldn't put it down! A MUST READ for all mystery fans!"
2,Not Dr. Delaware's usual fare,"While I did find myself staying up late to finish ""The Web"", I rate it as my least favorite Alex Delaware novel. It was just too weird. There really weren't any psychological thrills, just poking around on an island. And the characters were really lame. I am also getting sick of Robin. Alex needs to fly solo awhile or else hook up with someone more interesting. A disappointmen"
1,Worst Kellerman yet,"For me, the biggest mystery in a Kellerman book is how does this man get an audiance for this shlock? I only finished it to see if he could write anything more preposterous in his 19th book than he did in his 1st, When The Bough Breaks. In this quest, Dr. Kellerman has succeeded. It's laughable."
3,I've read most of the series & this is the poorest.,"I normally thoroughly enjoy all the Alex Delaware novels. Unfortunately I cannot say this one was up to standard. I recommend the author, but do not start with this one. If you are already a fan, & keen on reading the full series, then do not take this one on holidays. Use this one as the late night,""I'll just read one chapter before I go to sleep even though I have to get up early"" one and chances are, you will only read one chapter that night & will get up on time!"
2,Unbelievable and not very interesting,"While some books are a bit unrealistic, but are interesting nonetheless, this one was neither. I could not figure out were Mr. Kellerman was going with the plot line, and apparently neither could he. While I usually enjoy his work, this one just wasn't up to par."
2,Oh man!,"After reading Jonathon Kellerman's ""Priviate Eyes"" I got a good taste of what kind of wounderful books this man writes. But give me a break! Whatever happened to the psychological suspence that I adored in ""Prviete Eyes""? I think Mr. Kellerman put a little twist into this book and went to a setting that not what most people were expecting."
1,Only bad book he's written,"I finished it, my husband couldn't. We have read all his previous books and loved them. Poor research on the area also. If he was within stricking distance of Saipan, the island was definitely subject to typhoons on a regular basis."
2,Jonathan Kellerman's Day Off,"I've become a good fan of Jonathan Kellerman's series of Alex Delaware novels, but if this were the first I'd ever read I would never have picked up another.While the old scenario of being trapped on an island with no supply ship coming in some time creates some suspense, I found the payoff of this novel unrealistic and wholly unsatisfying. Kellerman tries to presentt a complex villian, with conflicting motivations, but just ends up with a muddy character given to maudlin speeches.Then again...I *did* read all the way to the end and had to see how it all turned out. I should be so lucky to be able to write a 300+ page book that people would actually wade thru to the end! Everyone deserves a day off every now and then, and this was Mr. Kellerman's. Let's hope THE CLINIC, coming in January 1997 is a big rebound!"
5,Kellerman's Delaware Books Rock,I enjoy Kellerman's works of fiction that feature the Alex Delaware character and this was no different. It was nice to see a change of pace and setting while maintaining the integrity of the character.
2,"Sllooowwww moving, unbelievable plot","I won't spoil things by divulging the ""surprise"" twist, but leave it to say that the thin characters and slow moving, hard-to-swallow plot made this read a disappointment. This was my first Kellerman outing, and it will be awhile before I take to the road with him again. Luckily I got this at Half Priced Books, so the outlay wasn't much."
3,Good But should have been better,"Of all the books that I have read of Kellerman this is the one that didn't interest me like the other one. It has some suspense in it but not as much as the others. But how Kellerman can keep something so well kept until it is the right time to say it is amazing. how in the end everything just comes together.From day one Moreland seemed like he had many secrets and he liked to play games with using quotes which at the time didn't make sense. But once Alex confronts Moreland that's when it all just makes sense. What Moreland does is just awkward. But he means to do good even when it affects him, physically and mentally. overall it was a good book"
2,A weird abberation,"What happened here? After reading ""Time Bomb"" and ""The Clinic"" (Both excellent) I happened upon this...The reader below who mentioned the X- Files was spot on. Ludicrous and severly hampered by the presence of Delawares wife and dog. Pass the sick bag vicar"
1,Even Chris Carter would reject this for a script,"Title should be ""Scully & Mulder go to Polynesia"". I have enjoyed evey Alex Delaware so far, but this turkey is definitly an X-File wannabe. Only difference is Spooky & friend would have lost the children on the way back to Hawaii, and have no proof of their existence. With luck, the book would have been lost with them."
5,Little Arthur,"Amazon's Book Desciption(above)is refering to the book ""The First Mountain Man"" and not The Fisrt Mountain Man - Preacher. The story follows the Life of the Preacher as a young boy named Arthur who lives in Ohio. Arthur decides at age 12 to leave home to live an adventurous life. He encounters some good men and some bad men, hustlers, con men, saloons, beer, prostitutes, river pirates, slave traders, indians the Army & war.I would kind of think a story like this would have been the first book in the series but it falls in at book # 8.Very enjoyable book and like the others its hard to stop reading it once you've started it."
4,Good for those who want to start Bean development,"Has good introduction, as some reviewers have complained, it does not have many examples,but the theoretical part has been dealt quite extensively."
4,A good book for the uninitiated,"Actually I bought this book about two years ago, and at that time Java Beans were gaining popularity as an instance of component model for distributed computing. I was at that time interested in Enterprise Java Beans rather than client side beans. So I did not really use the book that much. However, from the limited reading I did, it seemed like a very well written book for the uninitiated, gave a good view of the Beans, how to create the client side beans etc. However, since then I have moved my field of interest from Java to some thing else, and in the mean time EJB have taken an increasingly important role in the server side component model. So I hope this book is updated or the same authors write a separate book on EJB (more meaningful to do the latter)."
2,Very disappointed!,"The book wastes so much time explaining things that are basic components of Java and doesn't go straight to JavaBeans architecture and what JavaBeans are. Not until chapters 7 and 8 the author starts talking about JavaBeans. If someone wants to get this book then by the second half of the book not all :)I havn't read the second part but I will start now, hopefully, I come out with some benfit of how to develop JavaBeans, not Object Serialization, Events, Jar Files, etc.If you know Java well don't buy this book."
5,Best Java Beans book,"is a goodbook for learning JavaBeans and all the other associated topics. It covers JavaBeans, the 1.1event model, properties, persistence, JAR files, BeanBox, introspection, and ActiveX.The writing is very concise and easy to understand. The book contains many useful codeexamples.This book is not only useful to JavaBeans programmers, but it is also useful to people needingto learn about the other topics covered. I recommend it."
2,writing is good but examples are poor,"The writing is pretty good. Reading this book, a Java programmer can understand the Java Beans concepts. But the examples are extremely sloppy: full of errors, some don't compile, some exhibit incompetent Java threads programming concepts.Corrected examples should be put on the Web site. This is the only O'Reilly book I've read that wasn't very good."
2,Confusing book about beans,"This is not a good tutorial about Java Beans. In order to explain the Java Bean concept you have to start with the Java Beans specifications of Sun. This would answer question about which things are relevant and why they are relevant in JavaBeans development. Now the the reader almost jumps into a long winded explanation about events and adapters, wondering why this is relevant and what the writer wants to explain. To make matters worse: the example contains errors! Basically, after the first three chapters I was utterly confused.This book also needs a clearer description about the use of Java Beans. In a next update we definitely need a chapter about how JavaBeans are used in Java Server Pages."
4,"Good book, but not only about Java Beans though.","This book is titled ""Developing Java Beans"". It spends lots of time to talk about the detailed architecture of Event model and other important topics used in Beans. It is well written and easy to follow. However, may not be the good book for those poeple in a rush just want to how to write a Java Beans."
3,"Just an ""OK"" book","I bought this book to learn how to write Java Beans, after buying another book that was totally useless. This one did cover all I needed to know in a clear manner.So why didn't I give it more stars? As others have mentioned, the examples are full of errors. However I also felt the examples were somewhat vacuous. They weren't really that good at explaining the concepts.The final reason this book now collects dust is that my Java IDE does such a good job of automatically generating the Bean interface that I find the book unnecessary. Perhaps the book has been made obsolete by the advancement of technology?"
2,I am disappointed,"I was disappointed with this book. Almost 300 pages, half are I found worthless. I have programmed in Swing and JDBC, I wanted to start getting into some Java Bean development. The first part of this book is too much of a review for anyone who has done any Java programming before (a review of the Java Event model). The example code is poor. Definitly a rush job."
1,Not worth the money,Very poor book. Lack of working examples and not much more information than is contained in the Beans specification. Mr. Englander pulled the wool over O'Reilly's eyes on this one.
4,Solid content despite examples,"I found the explanation of JavaBeans to be very clear and understandable. Although the examples are rather trivial, they do seem to support the concepts. I found the book to be very useful and to the point."
3,satisfactory,"This book was fine for using for school. Even though it has alot of markings in it, the pages and binding are in pretty good shape. So,the shape was represented correctly by the seller."
4,something to note...,"This is a great collection and will please any fans of Howard's work, however the numerous typos are disconcerting. Every few pages there are errors that at first glance make little sense. They should be obvious to any proofreader, especially in such quantity.It's my opinion that the text of this compilation was scanned from another source by a computer program, perhaps run through a second program to check for spelling errors, and reprinted without ever being properly proofread by a human being.I'm not sorry I bought this book, but I am a little disappointed at how some publishers are so lazy as to rely almost wholly on computers."
5,Superb Howard Collection,"In my opinion, this anthology captures the spirit of the American experience that might not seem immediately apparent in any one of Howard's works. Thanks to this collection I now see the literary parallels between Howard and other American greats such as Hawthorne, Poe, Twain, and London.Kudos to Bison for publishing this in paperback."
4,Brutal and Entertaining,"This is some excellent writing that really takes the reader to interesting places. I first heard of Howard through Lovecraft, another favorite of mine. Bleeding liberals like me might be taken aback by some of his borderline-racist descriptions, but it doesn't really distract from the stories all that much.I'd love to see some of these stories adapted into film."
4,Nice deep pockets,"I received these sheets about a month ago and have been overall pleased with the product. I have an extremely thick mattress (pillowtop) and finding sheets with pockets deep enough to cover the mattress and the pad is very difficult. These sheets fit the bill and they look great. I was suprised that they were not a little softer considering the high thread count however, that may change with more washings. I haven't noticed any problems with quality (loose threads, seams, etc). Color is consistent."
3,It's okay,I always preferred Wolfsbane live because they had a certain energy. They never cut through to the next level and personally I can see why. They were good....but not that good. Blaze is better solo.
3,Don't Get Me Wrong...,"This book is very good--actually it is a little TOO good for my purposes. I wanted some basic information and what I got was a scholarly book written some years ago that goes into a bit too much detail for me--TMI, actually. Also, it is written in dated prose often using long, complex sentences, so it is not always easy reading. To be fair, if I were a scholar doing a research project, I would have rated it higher."
3,"It's Okay, but it's Rather Uneventful.","Listening to ""Malajusted"" is like drinking a cup of decaf coffee: it tastes like the real thing, but it doesn't deliver the usual rush of energy. This CD is wholly listenable, with Mozzer singing through the usual themes of self-pity (""Trouble Loves Me""), betrayal (""Sorrow Will Come in the End""), and persecution (""He Cried""). But the magic is missing. ""Malajusted""'s biggest flaw is the music and production, which lack the bite and zest of ""Your Arsenal,"" which may be his best album ever. The guitar-based melodies get predictable, never rising above what we've already heard. In the end, ""Malajusted"" doesn't sound like a Morrissey CD; it instead sounds more like a respectable interpretation from a competent covers band. That can't be a good thing, can it?"
3,"Very solid, but not much new here...","...although at this point, we know what to expect from Morrissey. I think some of his best work is on this album. The title track and ""He Cried"" are excellent, heartfelt songs-- very different from each other, but with the conviction we have come to expect (and no small amount of humor). ""Satan Rejected My Soul"" is an undeniable song, a wild, joyous ride with one of the best hooks in recorded history. THE PROBLEM IS, the rest of the album isn't so hot. I listen to it all the time and I can't remember what most of the other songs are called! They're good, but I expect that much at least. ""Sorrow Will Come In the End"" is a spoken-word song, which isn't bad in and of itself except that I think it's kind of creepy to hear those particular lyrics spoken rather than sung. Moreover, alot of the album is really super wimpy. Well worth owning it, but don't expect it to be the best thing you've ever heard."
3,...so far,"To create and follow idols may be natural enough, but it is a preoccupation that is shaken when a favorite artist releases material that is not quite right. With The Smiths, Morrissey established himself as a master songwriter. Those who bother to afford him a close listen will discover an artist whose work combines the tongue-in-cheek with the heartbreaking. Unfortunately, this album does not meet with our expectations. I do wonder where he has gone."
3,It's all good- but not good enough...,"I wanted/ needed this album to be great... and I thought I felt something a minute or so into the first track, it never came to pass. Alma Matters sounds like Morrissey formula, and I never got that Morrissey felt like Alma really mattered. I was also not convinced of the importance of Papa Jack or Roy. Comparisons to Southpaw Grammer futher baffeled me, because Southpaw was so self indulgent. Morrissey has two incredible solo albums - (although very different) Your Arsenal & Vauxhall and I, for me - those set the standard. In 2002 (at 43) Morrissey is making the best most important music of his carrer although it is as of yet unrecorded. Once it is, I'll revisit the gorgeous 'Trouble Loves Me' and say ""It's all good""."
2,Heaven knows I'M miserable now,"God, this one blew. Die-hard morrissey fans would appreciate an album of him farting edith piaf tunes so be careful what you read. It's just sad. He gets these great reviews but why?"
1,moz what happened?,"morrissey has been my favorite singer for 8 years but this new album is not any good. i tried to like it i really did. but somethings just don't happen. morrissey has shown me alot about my self and other people but, i'm afraid he lost his touch. and I know there are always those hard core fans that will like anything and bash my review but remember ignorance is bliss. if your looking for some good morrissey pick up bona drag or your arsenal."
2,Only for the Obsessive,"Morrissey is an acquired taste as it is. This is not the album that will win over new converts. His lyrics have always been his strength, but they are starting to become a bit tired. ""Roy's Keen"" is admittedly amusing, but the album overall is nothing special. Formulaic and predictable. Try Viva Hate or Your Arsenal first."
2,Trouble loves him; please phone home Johnny Marr!!,"In his 7th solo since dissolving The Smiths, Moz has hit an all-time low. The only track worth listening to in this collection is the poignant ""Trouble Loves Me"", a ballad reminiscent of his early days with Johnny Marr. Similar to Elton John without Bernie, Morrissey is lost without the music Marr used to provide him; yet he continues to issue record upon record of dull, dreary, tuneless songs until you want to scream ""Release your (huge) ego and call up Johnny"" - while we're still young."
4,Why Is He Dropping and Changing Tracks?,"I remember Papa Jack as being one of the more tuneful and melodic songs on Maladjusted, and should have read the track listing before I ordered this. Same with the re-issue of Bona Drag. He dropped a whole verse from Ouija Board thus mutilating it (remember the shattering of glass in the background after his name was spelt out?), gone!!I hope he doesn't pull this type of thing when and if Kill Uncle is remastered.Not happy Moz!!!Plus now I have to fork out for a inferior sounding original pressing of Maladjusted just to get Papa Jack back."
4,Have you ever seen a keener window cleaner?,"I am a big fan so expect some bias. Morrissey, in my opinion, has yet to make an album this isn't delightfully listenable. Maladjusted has the same fun and downtrodden spirit as do previous Moz-works. The title track, Troble Loves me, and Roy's Keen are the standouts on this album."
5,A GREAT ALBUM!,"Im not sure why people rag this album the way that they do. To me , I think people expect too much out of this poor man. Yes, The Smiths were FANTASTIC and the legacy they left is a hard one to live up to. But this is a different Morrissey..I think people cannot let go of the idea that he is supposed to sound like this or like that. MOrrissey has and always will be a pop singer..and a great one at that. This album is full of catchy songs. The songs are so fueled by emotions, good and bad. There isnt much to say about this album except, if you are a new fan of Morrissey and want to hear catchy, well crafted emotional pop music, then pick this one up! If you are looking for another Smiths record then go elsewhere. I give this five stars..period!"
1,"""Maladjusted"" -- An Appropriate Title","Absolute dreck. Proof positive that whatever it was Mozzer had, it's long gone. Bottom of the barrel cliche mongering at its worst. Stick to ""Viva Hate."""
1,Uninspired,"Morrissey on auto-pilot. The opening track is interesting but everything seems to go downhill from there--and further. ""Alma Matters"" ""Ambitious Outsiders"" ""Trouble Loves Me"" aren't even fit enough or even tuneful to appear as a Morrissey b-side. Retire, or start some musical experimentation--PLEASE!"
1,Morrissey:a small talent requires a small review,"""Maladjusted"":Really,staggeringly,bottom-of-barrel awful.You're as likely to be able to remember what you had for breakfast 12 years ago to the day as you are to remember any of these songs.Surely released to win a bet.Low Point:the one where he whinges about getting busted ripping his backing band off.Oh dear."
4,Morrissey's back and finally with some new work.,"Morrissey comes back with a stronger performance this time than his previous album ""Southpaw Grammar"", which only had a couple songs that I would consider hits. In Maladjusted, Morrissey has quite a few great songs here including: Alma Matters, Ammunition, Wide to Receive, He Cried, and so on. Of course these are the best songs in the album, there are songs which are passable and perhaps quite humorous such as Satan rejected my Soul, showing his self-loathing side, ha, ha and also Maladjusted a kind of surreal, chaotic sounding song where he again pokes fun at himself. Why not, this album should definitely not be taken seriously when he gets into his depressive lamentations, just see the big joke of it all and you'll thoroughly enjoy this album."
5,Fabulous Musical Experience,"When my family recommended that I listen to Secret Garden I didn't pay much attention. THEN I got this album from the library and couldn't stop listening to it. In my opinion there is not a bad Secret Garden album. The best words I can think of to describe this album is - a sensual musical experience not to be missed. And for all you Josh fans out there (and I'm a devout Grobanite) ""You Raise Me Up"" on Josh's Closer does list Rolf Lovland, from Secret Garden, as a writer of the song. The versions are very different in style and both to be appreciated in their own light. In closing I say, buy all the Secret Garden albums and you won't be dissappointed with any of them."
4,Haven't heard the whole CD except for You Raise Me Up,"I agree that Secret Gardens rendition of ""You Raise Me Up"" is far above Josh Grobon's version (sorry Josh fans). What really upsets me is that when you do a search (example in Google) with just the song title Josh Grobon comes up all over the place and that is a pity for people who have never heard this beautiful, spirit moving original version. I have read the other reviews and can't wait to purchase the whole CD."
2,disappointing,"We typically really enjoy these cds but this one falls short of our expectations. It's certainly not their best work, in our opinion. Wish I had sampled it before I purchased."
4,good listening,"I enjoy most of the tracks except a few tracks that sound very rushing. In my opinion, Songs of a secret garden is the best, next is Once in a red moon."
3,There are better Secret Garden albums,"After listening to ""Songs from a Secret Garden"" by these same guys, I recommend that you stay away from this one and check that one out. In this production, they seem to want to sound like a bunch of people: Celine Dion, Andrea Bocelli, Josh Groban, Sarah Brightman... They have a great sound if they attempt to sound like themselves. I don't know what they are attempting with this work. With the exception of ""The Promise"" I found the album very shallow."
3,"Too much singing, big departures from the original albums","Good music, to be sure, but if you were expecting a continuation of the smooth, simple styles of the original ablum (and White Stones, too) get ready for an updated feel. A ton more singing, as the vocals go from being merely accents to the focus of the song. I dislike that and preferred their smooth instrumentals. If you're like me, forget these albums (and the Dawn of the New Century has the same problem) and go for the original compilation or the White Stones CD."
5,This CD will lift your soul!!!,The new CD Secret Garden once in a red moon has a more experimental sound to the music exploring other sides of the secret garden. The music also introduces other artist to collaborate thier music style into the secret graden. I like the new songs especialy the last one elegie very dramatic and the awakening and silent wings solo piano. Great CD recommended.
4,Provides good information,"Still reading, but so far it seems great. I believe it will help me make more informed decisions in the security field (hospital environment). Thanks"
2,not very happy,for what i paid for this for a little more i could by quality protein...not a bunch of fillers...and it takes 2 scoops of this to make 24 grams...not good..i recommend the dymatize brand whey...awesome stuff.
5,John,I have used this product since it was just Nlarge. It has improved to Nlarge 3 and it still does what it claims to do. If your looking to add size this is your product.
4,good product. bad experience,"I received this item with the seal in place but the lid came off and some of the product spilled. I contacted customer service who was very helpful and proceeded to send me a replacement item. However, the courier never came for the product and I had to go deliver it to the courier myself. The process became long and I became frustrated in the end."
3,"Good buy, but one complaint.",I like the globe and the illumination is nice. It is not as manuverable as I would like. Rotating is awkward.
5,A classic Christmas album by Burl from 1968,"This excellent Christmas album is definitely a classic. He does do fine renditions of Christmas standards such as Jingle Bells, It Came a Midnight Clear, O Holy Night, etc. but some of the tracks that makes this album worth buying alone include ""Santa Mouse"" and number one, the prayer entitled ""Happy Birthday Jesus"" and of course the unique voice of Burl Ives."
3,We LOVE Burl Ives...but...,"Our favorite Christmas albumn is ""Holly Jolly Christmas"" by Burl Ives and we adore his many folk song albumns too. Burl has such a unique voice and a wonderful delivery that makes him one of a kind. I gave 10 ""Holly"" CDs to people for Christmas this year. We are HUGE Burl Ives fans. Having said that, I was a little disappointed in this albumn. I actually felt bad for him because it would seem that he just couldn't muster enough singing out of his voice and he narrates many of these songs. He was pretty old when he made this albumn. I don't mind some narration and I WANTED to enjoy this CD, but I didn't. We will continue to wear out our ""Holly Jolly Christmas"" CD but this one will probably get once-a-Christmas-season playing, if that. Maybe it will grow on me and I'll feel differently years from now, but in retrospect, I wish I hadn't purchased this CD. Sorry, Burl."
2,Not for hot weather or long runs,"I bought this product and just went on my first run with it: eight miles in 80-degree, humid weather. About halfway through, the screen fogged up. I stopped and took the iPod out of the case, and the iPod was covered in sweat. The fabric that lines the inside of the wristband/case absorbs moisture, but the neoprene that covers the outside doesn't allow it to evaporate. Besides allowing a lot of sweat to build up around your iPod, it also makes your wrist awfully hot.For walking or for short runs in cooler weather, this would be fine; but if you find much sweat on your shirt during a run, you can probably figure you'd have a lot of sweat on your iPod too if you used this. Not recommended."
3,"Works, but quality could be better","Once you get used to putting it on your arm, the case works just fine. At the beginning, though, it there were several times when the strap extension (for the arm) would disconnect while putting it on.Also, after having used this for several months, the bottom of the case, where you need to stretch is to insert the iPod with the Nike dongle, is starting to separate on me.Once this one bites the dust, I'll probably buy the Nike+ Sport Armband (not available when I bought this one)."
5,The perfect companion to the Nike+ sport kit,"If you're like me and don't want to spend money on Nike shoes just for the Nike+ iPod sport kit, then this what you need to get.I had been looking at just the sensor holder (that attaches to your shoe), but didn't think it was worth the price they wanted. Then I saw this combo which comes with a wrist/arm band that fits your nano snuggly with the receiver attached and the shoe sensor holder.The combination works! Placing the sensor on the laces instead of under the sole works just fine.One problem that I've heard others face is that the backing of the wrist/armband starts to tear. It's a little difficult to squeeze your nano through the fabric.But it's a great combo for a decent price."
4,Great product,"I really love being able to put my ipod on my forearm when I workout rather than my bicep. It's much easier to change songs! I do wish the case had a hole for the lock button, but it's easy to make your own."
5,Love it!,"I love this case. I've tried others and I find they 'stick' after a good run. The Marware's lightweight, it breaths well and very comfortable. It comes with an armband expander, but I wear it on my wrist. I use it with my Nike+ and like to see the face/screen of the iPod. Probably my only draw back is it's not super easy to turn the hold button of my iPod on and off. But minor compared to the whole package. Love it."
4,Extension,"This arm band works very good, but the arm extension is difficult to attached and use. You could have two diffetent options, or improve the arm extension."
1,What a piece of junk.,"I bought this because I wanted a window for the controls, which the nike armband doesn't have. It says it's a wristband/armband, so I assumed it was elastic and could stretch, it can't. It's made for people with small arms, and barely fits over my wrist. They include an extender, but it uses such a small piece of velcro that it comes loose and drops your ipod if you look at it funny. Also, the window fogs up the instant you start sweating.If you have tiny wrists and never sweat, it's perfect. For me it's completely useless."
3,Works but fogs up,Works fine on short runs. Unfortunately at about mile 6 on a day that was about 75 degrees it fogged up and couldn't read the screen at all anymore.
1,Won't work if you're serious about working out,"I was very excited when I got this armband, I love that you can put it around your wrist and that it fits my small arm. But I was training for an Ironman in the middle of a humid Miami summer, and this product failed miserably very early on. Now that it's winter, I thought the armband would work. Not so. After 1/2 hour of working out, the case gets very steamy and doesn't respond to you trying to press the buttons. Your iPod will stop working, it'll lock up even if you don't lock it. You won't be able to adjust the volume or change your song selection. Until a better product comes out, I'm back to exposing my iPod to the elements, and carrying it exposed in my hand."
2,Somewhere between good and bad,"I knew Kim Criswell's voice from some of her original cast recordings but haven't heard her other albums that some of the other reviews mentioned. Either way, I think this is a passable CD. On one hand, she could have been more adventurous in her choice of songs. I think if she had been working with the people at Varese Sarabande, for instance, the songs might have been more unusual and exciting. On the other hand, she is a dynamic singer who is interesting, even if the material isn't always. So a mixed review to this one. It's not horrible and it's not great."
1,Not my kind of Broadway,Give me Elaine Paige or Michelle Nicastro or Betty Buckley or Sally Mayes any day!
1,Not one of my favorites,"This could have been an exciting album, but the arrangements don't really help Kim Criswell out that much. I don't mind her song choices, but these arrangements are terribly lackluster and bring out the worst in Kim!"
1,THIS IS FUNNY!,READING THE LITTLE CATFIGHTS ABOUT THIS DISC ARE MORE INTERESTING THAN THE DISC ITSELF!
1,"I'm kind of sad, in a way.","I'm very disappointed in this CD. Not at all what I had expected. If I'd had the opportunity to listen to this before I purchased it, I would not have bought it. I have the deepest respect for Kim Criswell but feel the best must be yet to come."
1,"I'm kind of sad, in a way.","I'm very disaapointed in this CD. Not at all what I had expected. If I'd had the opportunity to listen to this before I purchased it, I would not have bought it. I have the deepest respect for Kim Criswell but feel the best must be yet to come."
1,Well...,"I was kind of afraid to buy this after reading some of the comments. But it's not horrible, just unexceptional. There are about four good performances on the disc. The rest sound like they come from some community theater production. I don't hate this disc, but I'm going to try to resell it."
1,I don't like this album.,"I don't like this album. If you like show music, better to buy something by Bernadette Peters, Maria Friedman or Judy Kaye instead of this. Thank you."
2,"Kim, go ""Back to Before""","Kim Criswell was a lot more vivacious when she was belting out classics from the '30s and '40s on ""The Lorelei"" a few years ago. This stuff is pleasant without ever really being memorable -- ""Tomorrow""??? Oh, come on, Kim! You're a little too old to be doing Annie. ""Annie Get Your Gun"" -- yes! The red-headed orphan -- NO!!And would someone please teach that scary Criswell FAN-atic who keeps posting the same rating how to spell ""FANTASTIC""????"
1,Not worth the money,"I don't think this is the worst disc I've heard or anything, but it's not worth spending $15 on. There are a couple of nice performances, but for the most part, it's too familiar and mannered. Stick with her work on ""The Slow Drag."""
1,Not very thoughtful,"Kim Criswell is a great talent, but I'm shocked at how little thought & imagination she puts into her songs. A big voice is not enough. What about things like creativity, good arrangements and a fresh approach to music? You won't find those qualities here, unfortunately. This album could have been recorded 15 years ago. That doesn't mean it's timeless. It means it is tired. I don't even recommend this with reservations."
1,"""Before"" rhymes with ""Bore""","Kim Criswell wasn't a familiar name to me, even though I am a MAJOR Broadway buff. No wonder, after hearing this CD. There is no sense of adventure here, just a performer singing some of the most common, overworked songs in theater history. Listening to this, there is no sense that this a performer willing to try anything new; instead she is sticking to the old guard and not doing anything new with it. Audra McDonald and Ruthie Henshall have nothing to worry about. This is a Christmas present that is not going to be getting a lot of plays from me."
5,SUPERB,"Everytime I listen to another Kim Criswell cd, I get goosebumps. Every cd she does, she tops herself! I just love it! Her ""Memory"" recording is brilliant and it has some new orchestrations that are perfect!She is so talented and yet, one wonders why she isn't a bigger star in America! She is HUGE is Europe!Thanks"
1,Great songs and a not so great Singer,"I can't argue about the selection of songs here. They are classics for a reason. They are some of the best loved show tunes of all time! But the delivery by the singer here is not good. She is loud and unemotional and never moved me. I thought it would be hard not to be moved by the song Memory but Kim Criswell did it. If you love Broadway, there are much better albums than this."
1,What else can you say?,"There's not a lot to say about this CD, other than it's not very good. Not to beat a dead horse, but the singer is usually capable of so much more than what she does here."
5,liking myself,This was a great book for kids that are unsure of themselves. I thought it was so great because it had poems in it that could help one relook at themselves from someone else point of view.thanks
5,Great polishing tool,I had to get use to them at first. I used them to polish metal items with my Dremel and they do a great job. At first I used too much force. It is best to take it slow and get the feel for the buffing wheels. Pairs great with MAAS Polish
4,great for polishing,"great for polishing jewelry and small parts, the onlyproblem is the mess they leave. lots of little pieces ofstring every where."
1,Completely falls apart,"I did not read the reviews before purchasing - big mistake. The first one I put in my Dremel, at the lowest speed, sent small cloth fibers everywhere ... all over my clothes, all over the project I'm working on, the counter, the floor, my coffee 2 feet away, etc. I recommend spending more on better quality polishing wheels. As another reviewer said, I got what I paid for."
4,Good to polish metals,"Small size fits my tool just right. Some of the fabric on the wheels sluffs off, but still a good buy for the price."
2,"If you can, try another book first","My opinion may be biased because I first read about stochastic processes on Karlin's books. But I had to read this book after Karlin's books, and I am glad that I did not read this book first."
3,Probably a commercial trick,"This book is at a slightly higher level than ""Probability Models"" by the same author but is not self-contained, and even if you have a fairly good level of Maths and Stats you will probably need both books to grasp the concepts adequately.Its cost is outrageous, yet it shows again Ross's strengths: good examples and a mix of medium-level and some difficult problems worth trying.The only problem is if you buy both books you will spend a nice sum for having 80% of the information repeated..."
3,Good book but problems too difficult,"If you want to enjoy learning renewal and markov processes and other stochastic processes, this book will help you to do just that. To use this book, you need the book called Introduction to probability models by Ross also. Without it, you will never solve even a single problem from this book.The material is well organised but quite often you have to study several times to understand some concepts. Use it at advanced undergraduate or graduate level. As a beginner, forget it!. You may need a professor in applied probability to assist you in solving some problems."
5,very good book,"I would recommend this product to any statistcs student. Easy to read and understand, I was able to use it for two of my classes as a reference"
5,Great Guitar Rock,This is a great collection of an underappreciated band. They were fantastic live as well. Rock and Roll the way it was meant to be played with a sh*tload of attitude and brilliant guitar work. Take a listen and see for yourself...
5,Just what we needed!,"Since we purchased a deep soaking tub (from Amazon, of course), we needed a larger trip lever for it. There seemed to be mainly two different ones to choose from. The American Standard and the Moen. The tub is American Standard but the fixtures are Moen. We could have purchased either trip lever, however, after reading the reviews on both, it was clear that the Moen came out the winner. This is not an item people see as it's installed behind the wall, but you'll certainly know if it doesn't work as it should. It's great when people leave reviews so others can make informed choices."
4,"Danceable, Sweet R&B Song!","Christina Milian wrote this extraordinary song while dancing tosome music in Sweden. Little did she know how big it wouldbecome! It has a unique RnB tune with danceable lyrics. What Ilike most about this song is it's beat. It's smooth, easy todance and move to, and fun and catchy all at the same time without being just a disposable piece of music such as Britney.The RnB sound also adds a nice touch to it, so it doesn't soundas typical as normal pop music. Christina's voice also addssome ""darker"" flavour to it so it's sweet, but not bubblegumpop. This is a great song at a party or just dancing around yourroom! I'm looking forward to Christina's debut album in August."
2,Did somebody clone Mya???,"...well maybe not. But let me tell you, it sure sounds like it! Not only does Christina Milian's voice sound near exactly like Mya's, but this song ""AM to PM"" has a striking resemblence to Mya's ""Free."" But personally I like ""Free"" a lot better. Yes I enjoyed her solo featured in Ja Rule's ""Between Me & You"" but it was mainly because of the music. So if you want the real deal buy something from Mya. Her voice is a little more powerful but still keeps that cute-ish vibe she always gave off. What's up with all these Mya clones lately!! (another example, Ashanti)"
3,Find A Honey On The Wall....Get Down....That's Right,"The most awful and despisable and horrid, and, well, just plain BAD lyrics in teen dance pop music! Read this-""Find a honey that's standing on the wall, all the girls get the guys on the floor, hear thois (SCREAM) Somebody hit the lights, so we can rock it day and night, people getting down, that's right!"" If Christina wants to write, she needs to write about something better than ""people getting down that's right"" It's incredibly catchy, but seriously! Anyway, Ja Rule is not the kind of person a teen singer wants to work with...he's got a gravely voice full of pain...that isn't love...As for the snippets, they were in between to me"
3,A bit disappointed,"This may have been a piece of exciting teen literature 150 years ago, but it has become old fashioned very fast.Nowadays, Jules Verne would be sued by Greenpeace (his characters hunted almost any sort of animal in that island) not to talk about his racist remarks about Nab (afro-American character) who was ""of course"" in charge of cooking ""because he's black"" ...On one hand, the book is plenty of moral and patriotic lessons, surely very much in fashion at the time: from Ayrton's redemption to the incredibly good atmosphere and solidarity among the shipwrecked. On the other hand, the scientific achievements of Mr Cyrus Smith (from producing nitroglycerine to setting up a telegraph) makes him eligible for the next Nobel Prize and turns the whole plot quite unbelievable.An old fashioned fair piece of entertainment."
5,This is a fav,"I love this little whisk. It's a miniature whisk, haven't had any problems with it. I wouldn't count on it to whisk large amounts of anything, but it's great for stirring things in small bowls. I use it all time. Love it. And it's cute. Doesn't get much better than that."
4,Really nice whisk,"I bought this whisk for work. Every day I mix up a protein shake for lunch, so I bought this whisk to keep at my desk. Unfortunately, it is very short, so cleaning it becomes a pain because the shake mix gets down close to the handle. Because of this, I no longer use it. HOWEVER, it is a VERY nice whisk, it just doesn't suit my purpose. Depending on your use, I would recommend this whisk, but only for small jobs."
4,Kid still plays with it even after 2 years,"It was fun to build, has lot of details. But it has small pieces which make it unsuitable for homes with small kids."
2,makes me break out,"I use many Alba Even Advanced products: exfoliating scrub, day cream, night cream, so thought I'd try the facial cleanser. It dries out my skin and leads to breakouts. Will not be purchasing this in the future."
3,Not that scary... but pretty violent.,"Pretty good story about spooks of old time Indians and prospectors running around town near the Sierra Nevada. You and your friends happen to be caught in the middle of it. The story is nowhere near as creepy as Mystery of Chimney Rock but there are some pretty gruesome deaths. I, myself, stayed in one spot too long, got caught and tied at the stake by some ghosts who then proceeded to kill us with a burning rod of iron. wow. Pretty rough way for a handful of innocent kids to go. Some of the endings are unsatisfyingly cut short leaving you to wonder 'so?.. now what?'. The dialogue is also pretty dull at times with scooby doo like banter. Other than that, the book is well designed and flows well with no events being recycled from other paths."
2,A Fine Film in a Disappointing Transfer,"Lang's version of Molnar's stage play, ""Liliom"" is quite wonderful, and one of the best films he directed during his long period of exile. However, Kino's DVD transfer is a disappointment and should be avoided. Buy the VHS version instead, particularly since the DVD looks as if the VHS was merely reproduced with a further loss in duplication. Kino almost always produces good to excellent DVD transfers, so this one is doubly troublesome; the contrast is poor, important details are lost, and the overall image is fuzzy and as soft as whip cream. This should be a five star but the poor quality of the transfer brings it way down. I bought it because I had to see it, but I only saw part of the lovely film that Lang originally put on the screen."
2,Misnamed,"Would be better titled the history of the Shawnee dealings with Quakers, US government and avaricious whites. Does not cover much other than that. Disappointing."
4,A Valuable Study of a Colorful Political Character,"Sam Yorty was surely one of the great eccentrics of California politics. He is most noteworthy for his near-constant hunger for political office -- over the course of some 50 years, he ran for Senator, Governor and various other local and state positions, usually without success. As L.A. mayor, he was most memorable for his many out of town trips, as well as for his overtly racist campaigns against rival Tom Bradley. YORTY: POLITICS OF A CONSTANT CANDIDATE is the only serious study of this colorful political survivor's electoral exploits. While it concludes before his 1973 defeat by Bradley, it does cover most of his campaigns, including his bizarre run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1972. Until a more comprehensive book is published, it is the best resource for the adventures of this liberal-turned-conservative gadfly and habitual office-seeker."
3,A Collection of Somewhat Interesting Short Stories,"This book is a collection of short stories, most not having to do with the sea. They are somewhat interesting and most have some sort of reference to World War II veterans. Some of the stories were better than others, but overall I had some trouble getting through the book."
4,Suspense,I found the characters (Alayna&Khavon) to be so real. The book held my attention from beginning to end. I enjoyed the fact the she was an educated successful woman even though she had a rough childhood. I believe many women can relate to what Alyana is feeling about marriage. Life is full of suprises and so is this book! It is definetly a winner. The romance scenes are the ones you only think about when you are with that special person! I can't wait for the next book...
3,"Okay, but not terrific","I have purchased several of these carbonless receipt books and while generally they work fine, I occasionally find one that doesn't 'copy' onto the other pages. All in all, it's OK."
2,"Waiter, there a fly in my meditation...","After being enchanted with many of the other CDs in this series, I was disappointed with this one. The major flaw? In the rush to give you ""slice of life"" background sound, mostly with a campfire at the beach, a very annoying fly has buzzed in. What could have been another relaxing CD in this series, turns into an aggrevation, as you miss most of the music waiting for the fly to come back again and again. Real life? Sure. Nice time? No."
1,Not a helpful work of criticism/commentary,"I was disappointed by this commentary in many ways. I was looking for some literary criticism that would address some of the assertions posited by Seth himself in his text regarding the place of the novel in history, the state of the Anglo-Indian novel, and the abilities of the author himself. I recommend reading Seth's wiki page over the purchase of this volume."
4,good pan,"I think the pan is good. I like the metal cover, it is easier to store than a glass one. The only thing I didn't really like was that the directions inside the box say they don't recommend washing it in the dishwasher. That was the reason I chose scanpan because they were supposed to be dishwasher safe."
5,perfect big heavy pan,"This pan is large, heavy duty, and the non-stick quality makes it easy to clean. I have had it for just a few weeks and already use it multiple times per week."
1,NOT THE REAL ALBUM. IT'S A CHOPPED ANF SCREWED VERSION,"NOT THE REAL ALBUM. IT'S A CHOPPED ANF SCREWED VERSIONIf you want the original album, look elsewhere!!"
4,This Album is definetely not for the P###ies,"This Cd is about drugs, money, sex and murder. Not very orginal ehhhhh, except those fake rappers ""JA RULE"" and ""DMX"" never had such a deep, riveting voice. I don't think a voice, besides Eazy-E's, has carried an album before. One of the most distinctive voices ever!"
4,This is hard,Yes it is very true that Scarface is very OVER-RATED but he still is a great MC.And all of his Rhymes on here are very hardcore somewhat Chuck D sounding.If your a fan of Scarface you will love this because the lyrics on this CD are dopeLyrics 10/10 Production 7/10 X Factor 8/10 Classic 9/10 Me 8/10Overall=42/50 This album will pick up 4 Mics are 8 Fingers
4,Very moving,Tara wrote all the music and lyrics. Both ladies gave the music a lot of heart. Just a shame that they went their seperate ways a short while after this CD was completed.
4,The songs are all awesome if you enjoy this type of music,The cd was an awesome compilation of folk songs. The lyrics within the songs were well written and and well thoughtout. This is the first cd i have ever own of folk music and i enjoyed it. I wish there were more cds of this particular group.
3,the american way,"As is typical with many American groups of any sort...and just bands in general (especially those who make profound impacts in any musical genre), the sophmore album that we've been waiting for somewhere right around 4 years (give or take a few months) is the disapoitment we had all hoped it wouldn't be; With of course the exception of ""PHD"" ""Roll it up"" and ""The winner""....""The name of the game"" is an OK track. It might be the long wait we all had to endure to receive this album that makes this 2nd offering appear so weak and underworked, but in any case, It's not what some of us would like to think it could've been. As one reviewer has alreay stated, it dosen't matter, America will buy this CD and sky-rocket TCM even higher."
3,"Great Mixes, though nothing spectacular","Nothing in the CD really caught my attention, the Hidden track was great but otherwise a bit of a lackluster CD. The tracks on this album just seem to be perfect when you need a bit of background music that won't make your mind wander off of whatever you are doing that is important at the time. It's not bad but it's not something I'd find memorable."
3,winner,"I feel happy and alive when I listen to this CD from The Crystal Method. TWEEKEND is less overtly sensual. It has more complex, funky rhythms. I especially enjoy the first three tracks."
5,They've done it again...,"This album is definatly Crystal Method... Mind numbing beats, great synth-layering, another journeying trip into the minds of 2 very drunk individuals... Nothing bad to say about this album- Great to hear the inclusion of some sampled/live instruments- While this album is very reminescant of their earlier work, I feel it still has a different enough feel to still appeal to fans of Crystal's earlier work without making them feel like they are listening to Keep Hope Alive... Enjoy it..."
3,Not that bad,"This is Crystal Methods's second album ""Tweekend"" it took them almost 5 years to come up with a follower to the great ""Vegas"", unfortunately this isn't as good as their debut. ""Tweekend"" is not that bad, it got it's moments but only a few great one's compared to what i've expected. It's very noisy too, very rock influented but with a addition of some hip hop flavours too. Tom Morello and Scott Weiland appears on the album which is quite interesting to hear. The songs to check are ""PHD"" which is a great electro song with robotic voices, ""Name of the game"" noicy song with scratching and a mix between hip hop and rock, Not one of my favorites but notable. ""Ten miles back"" heavy drums and a very unique sound. ""Over the line"" which is slow, the only song. The rest are quite mediocre at best. The album is not bad at all like many say but compared to their last album it's a dissapointment. Still a good album, if you're into electronica."
4,Bust some moves,"I bought this CD after hailing their fist album as one of the most influential Chemical Beat albums to subtly mix Hip Hop, Industrial and Dance into a distinctly different kind of music and the artwork was cooool. The new album does move in a new direction, unfortunately it is a little more like comercial dance that the original hard assed beats that just made you want to bust some moves in you loungeroom. If your looking for another Busy Child or the classic Trip Like I Do it is not here. They are still good but I don't think that they have got better.I got the OZ edition with a bonus remix CD of 6 remix tracks which is pretty cool and helps make up for it not being as good an album as the first.AND IT HAS THE WORST COVER ART OF THE YEAR, It is tastless, contrived, juvenile and badly executed."
1,Its Not Vegas,"I was so excited about a new CD from Crystal Method. I loved Vegas, and I still do. Don't expect anything like that from this CD however. It's ok, but not what I expected from Crystal Method. I guess its just hard to keep momentum like that going. Not worth buying, but I suppose worth downloading."
2,"Couldn't carry ""VEGAS'"" Jock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I can't believe I had to wait 4 ... years for this CD to come out! Being such a fan of these guys, and seeing them in concert a few times, I was literaly begging for this new album to come out. I have to say that I am just a little more than disappointed! Be very careful. If you think that you are going to get anything that remotley sounds like that unbelievably beautiful, mezmorizing CD that they put out in 1997 it's gonna feel like getting a pair of socks on christmas morning! I did give it 2 stars just because of some of the base lines, they are indeed hardcore and phat!!"
2,Not as good as Vegas,"I was extremely dissapointed with this release. I had listened to Vegas and enjoyed it, but this one lacks the more complicated, trippy, fun aspects of the Vegas CD. This one has too many voice samples to make it seem ""cool"" and I mean, they get a bit annoying. Sure it is fine to use voice samples (like on Vegas they were used pretty well) but overdoing it ruins it. Then you've got that backstreet-boy-esque song w/lyrics... I am dissapointed that they are going more into mainstream styles. Vegas was so new, had such a distinct flavor.. this CD sounds like everyone else. Maybe they died and the record company hired some guys to sound like them.... hmmm..."
4,different but good,"It is different than their other cds. Different sound... not so much energy as before but I would highly recommend checking it out. As we all know, they are great live. Check them out if they are coming to a city near you this summer. And, if its in a smaller club then its a must see!"
4,techno hiphop rappers delight,"I really don't like all this new hip hop and rap rock, but Crystal Method has put something togeather that I admit took time to grow on me. I now like the whole album. Musically simplistic, good beats. Turn up the bass and kick back to this new millenium sound."
3,go see them live,"I thought this CD was average at best, it feels as though they just rolled too much together and ended up with a muddled, distorted sound. But I will say this: go see them live. Their live show gets 5 stars. They take their tracks to another level in the live venue. I've seen them three times now and I haven't been to any show yet where the crowd becomes as electric as they do for CM (with the possible exception of Orbital). They have an absolutely amazing lighting system that will make you trip even if you haven't dropped a thing. And if you have....oh boy. If you like to dance hard, check these guys out."
3,good but not great,"This is a good solid techno album. However, I didn't find it really all that special. ""Name of the Game"" is probably my least favorite track. Mostly because of that terrible Ryu and his crappy rapping. When I saw them live(they play an awesome live show) for the Tweekend tour, I was totally brought down when Ryu came out. Thank God it was for just that one song. Other than that this album is pretty good. Any Crystal Method fan should pick it up."
4,Is your subwoofer hungry?,"This cd absolutely thrives with high-powered systems. The bass on PHD and Over the Line is absolutely overpowering. As far as the music goes, this cd has strength in more than just the low end. The track I prefer is ""Blowout,"" because of how laid-back it is. The only song that doesn't appeal to me on this cd is ""Ten Miles Back,"" it just doesn't seem to work with the rest of the cd, and the vocals just don't go. Overall, a good offering, but not quite as powerful as Vegas was."
5,Expanded horizons,"It's too bad that people who like ""Vegas"" can't seem to wrap their minds around ""Tweekend,"" one of the better Techno albums that's come out this year.""Tweekend"" is to ""Vegas"" what the Chemical Brother's ""Surrender"" was to their older albums - an exploration into new territory that is fabulously victorious. It takes several listens to get used to their newer style because of the complexity involved, but tracks like ""PHD,"" ""Murder"" and ""Name of the Game"" flat-out rock, and ""Over the Line"" is mind-bendingly sweet.If you like ""Vegas"" or ""Surrender,"" give this album a fair chance. Listen long enough to understand where the Crystal Method is going with this material, and you'll love it as much as I do."
1,"Disappointing, hard to listen to","TCM was recommended to me several times, so I got this album. I really don't like it too much. It just isn't fun to listen to - gives me a headache. And I agree with the other reviewers that the bad language really isn't necessary. I think that TCM has spent a little too much time in a garage studio, and not enough time interacting with humanity. This music just does not connect with this human."
5,Sophmore Slump? I Don't Think So!,"Crystal Method is on the verge of becoming the very best that electronica has to offer. This album has such a wide variety of styles mixed in with the ever present CM vibe and hard breakbeat sound. With a few guests like Tom Morello(rage against the machine) and Scott Weiland, the album keeps pumping out one awesome track after the other while keeping it diverse and slightly different from Vegas, their debut album. If you like hard hitting electronica without a dull moment, these boys got your fix."
2,Ummm was it worth the wait?,"Vegas Was the cream of the crop! that cd has some really good syncs and has a unique sound that set the crystal method apart from the rest of those ""brits"" it basically kicked the chemical brothers right between their legs. BUT tweekend......it was a sad day for them when i listened to it. They should have ditched mr. Rage from the whole deal and stuck with thier old sounds and just expanded on it. Or maybe they should have waited to release vegas so it would sound and sell twenty times better when compared to tweekend. Still they are the crystal method so its not that bad but i was....dissapointed with this album hopefully they can figure out what went wrong and fix it on thier next one. And where the heck is the chick riffs???? or the space guy?? i'll listen to sound clips before i buy the next one with the hopes they will repent and do it on thier own again and kick the rage guy out of the studio when he tries to mess up thier music. Amen"
5,Absolutely UnFreaking Believable!,"Just played the entire cd for the second time, and I gotta say grab your socks cuz your going on freaking wild ride. You need to work off some stress after a rough day listening to the boss rag on your case? Then pop this gem in and RELEASE. I guarntee you will not sit still. Totally energetic heavy bass rhythms outsurpass Vegas. Buy This CD NOW!"
4,Nothing groundbreaking.. but a decent listen,"into the aftermath of moby's hugely popular ""play"".. where the world is thinking that electronic music is nice.. perhaps a little deeper than you once thought.. and that it's something you can have playing on your radio and is safe and sanitized a bit like.. well.. like ""pop"" music.. i want you to listen to ""Tweekend"".. while moby flaunts his new found maturity.. and spirituality.. and.. has gwen stefani glammed up.. well.... The Crystal Method took a different turn at some crossroad.. they've managed to keep the nice rythms from their last cd ""Vegas"".. and drop them all into a toxic bath of Rage Against the Machine's Guitar Hooks.. and Scott Weiland's Voice.. just letting the great dance elements sponge off of.. and merge with the rock stylings.. it's a nice thing to bob your head and rock out to a ""electronica"" cd.. all i wanna know is.. how are they going to handle the mosh pits at the raves??"
5,Crystal Method kicks serious ...,"The Crystal Method is absolutely one the best techno/electrica groups i have ever heard, the tweekend album is just sweet and i recomend you check out some of their other remixes like the ""magic carpet ride"" one. rock on."
3,Just another music fan,"I bought Tweekend because I had liked what I'd heard of the Crystal Method before and I liked ""Name of the Game"". Was it worth it? Meh. Keep in mind this is merely my opinion. Make your own!! Anyway I like techno and I liked Crystal Method and I love ""Name of the Game"" and I won't lie I liked the album. Sure it wasn't great but its one of those things that just grows on you over time. But I'll say one thing- some damn fine beats."
2,Cannot get into this,"I liked Vegas but have not been able to get into the new Crystal Method CD. Maybe I just haven't listened to it enough, but it just seems kinda boring."
4,Tweekend is a good Crystal Method Choice,"As all other reviews will tell you.. Vegas is clearly the best Crystal Method CD. Tweekend does not top Vegas by any means but is easily my second favorite Method CD. If you are a Crystal Method fan, you should feel no anxiety about purchasing Tweekend. It's different than Vegas but PHD, Wild, Sweet and Cool, You Know its Hard, Ten Miles back and Tough Guy are all solid cuts. As others will state it is a little bass heavy but I like it that way. Tweekend is a nice compliment to any Method fan collection."
3,Nice but reheated...,"I really, really like 'Vegas', it's one of my all time favorites. I was excited to find this new album by TCM, but disappointed because it lacks the spirit and originality of the first one. A lot of the songs on 'Tweekend' remind too much of some 'Vegas' tracks, and to make it worst they lack their drive. If you want more bang, check our 'Keep Hope Alive', a recent release of TCM remixes, it's really good."
3,"Okay, but I expected better","First off, I must say that I love Vegas. It is on my top ten list of cd's of all time. I still listen to the whole thing all the way through quite often. It has been four years since CM made an album, and I was excited for Tweekend. And to be honest, I am disappointed. Is the music bad? No. But its pop/rock/hardcorish stuff, not as much break beat as Vegas. That may be fine for some people, but I really just wanted more of the same as Vegas. With few exceptions, you won't find that here. Again, it is an decent cd, but not what i was hoping for."
1,Biggest disapointment in years,"Lets get this straight: THIS ALBUM IS AWFUL. I would give it 0 stars if it was possible. Why, you ask? Heres why: On this cd it seems that Ken and Scott have said ""Hey! Apparently, formulaic song-writing is the way to go! Hand me those funky beats and voice samples, we've got an album to make!"". And damn, thats exactly what they did on this album. Predictable songs that arent even backed up by nice sounds. This is one of the worst sell-out attempts I've heard yet. Another reviewer really hit the nail on the head calling this ""Crystal Bizkit"". It's an album that tries to win you over by showing how ""hardcore"" it is. The hard songs are ridiculously cliched and weak and the easier songs are boring as hell. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ALBUM."
1,Tweek-END,"This is by far the worst Crystal Method CD of all time.It is uninspired, unintelligent, and over all an hour of time that you'll want back. In short, it sucks... go buy Vegas or Legion of Boom instead."
1,Oh god help us all!,"This is an awful album. It is sad that a bad such as this is even mentioned in the same sentence as orbital and the chemical brothers. Not only do all the songs sound the same, they blatently copy sounds pioneered by the bands above 6 years ago! Do yourself a favour. Buy the single to Name of the Game and Dig you re own hole buy the Chemical Brothers and enjoy!"
4,Always on,"The duo that comprise the Crystal Method have acheived a new level of musical depth, branching into new ways of making techno evolve. They take time on this album, building the beats and breaks into more than just a collection of sounds. They do sometimes have the liability of over-extending themselves, but by and large manage to remain centered on a central groove that carries through the whole album."
4,Another crystal clear hit!,"I Only have one thing to say. "" They have done it again... "" If you liked what you have heard in the past - check this one out."
1,Pity for my money,"I wish I could have spent my money on something else rather than on a book full of Goverment propaganda. Anyway I can still use it for my fireplace. Too bad for you Mr Korff you can not convince anybody rather than your friends...All the best, but be careful with you next book"
1,"A ""don't-bother"" book","A poorly written, carelessly edited (typos throughout) rehash of the Roswell incident.The information presented is mostly lifted from other authors' works.A waste of my time and money....."
1,Disappointed,The sale was fine. Fast shipping.The DVD freezes and skips right from the opening seen. We tried to clean it and it played only marginally better. We stopped watching it due to all the freeze frames. There is a big blemish across the disk.
3,funny,"It was funny, but I thought we would like it better. Cat Balou is better, and Paint your Wagon is way better."
4,Car Repair Manual,"The book came in excellent condition. I was surprised how long the order took. I would have thought the book could have been shipped the same day or next day, but it was a few days before it shipped. Other than the shipping delay, the process was easy, and the results good."
2,Difficult text if you want to teach yourself,"I've found this book frustrating because there are no solutions to the exercises at the end of each section. Additionally, the author gives examples and then asks, ""what's wrong with this proof?"" but does not offer the answer, moving on as if the answer is obvious (not always). Because there are not very many examples in the instruction, I find it difficult to use this book as a sole source for teaching oneself. That said, I have found some of the instruction material helpful."
2,Dated?,"I read this aware that it was well over 10 years old, and alot has changed in climatology and the general environmental debate in that time. Nevertheless, it holds many concurrent arguments, and some which have (temporarily?) become unfashionable. It perhaps overstretches itself, in that it covers such a wide area of climate change debates, from desertification, ozone depletion, to historic global variability (ice ages etc)that it ultimately lost its thread and became an amalgam of all connected debates. Fast paced and written with humour, it is however still very readable, and may one day be looked upon as bold, even prescient in its Gaiian or holistic view of our planet."
2,A Big disappointment,"An informative book. However, most of the web addresses are invalid. The few that aren't invalid charge a huge fee for their services. I coud have hired a private investigator to do the job and not bothered with the book. The cost would be the same."
1,"Inflated ""List Price"" and False Discount","These books are a good idea for the repeat visitor to a city-- basically just a place for notes in the lovely (I think) Moleskine format. The maps, though, can be found better and cheaper on other places. MORE IMPORTANT, this seller has claimed a falsely inflated list price and consequent discount that is misleading. The list price for these books is 17.95. Check in any book store. Shame on the seller."
3,Nice Recovery,"After the horrid ""Strip"" this was a welcome return to form. Noisy, loud, and boisterous it is a great mid 80's release but still below his high points (""kings"", ""Prince Charming"", and ""Friend Or Foe"")"
5,Works Great!,"I actually tied this in to my deer feeder and never had a problem, it seems to be weather proof and everything! The price was worth a shot compared to others also."
5,Coleman 1 Watt Solar Trickle Charger,"My car seems to drain batteries and after it has been sitting for a couple days, needs to be jump-started. I cut the cigarette lighter plug from the end of this and wired it directly to my battery and leave the charger sitting on my dashboard. I get strong starts every time now! I am 100% thrilled with this product and I recommend it to everyone."
4,GeoTrax switches,The switches don't work well when used on the new elevated tracks. You can cut out a piece of the plastic on the bottom so they will fit onto the notch on the elevation stand. FP should have done this in their design.
5,great addition to our set,"this is a great addition to our Geotrax train set. My kids love it---especially the ""bumpy track"" that is a part of the set."
2,Was fun but not a lot of fun,"My kids played with this but not for long. Because these vehicles can't reverse or change speeds makes them rate pretty high on the ""get's bored fast"" meter. The idea of the toy is good but it really needs some extra user interface built into it."
2,MORE SPACE NEEDED,"Although the case is attractive and of apparent good quality, more space is needed for accessories.The compartments just aren't deep enough. My surge cube doesn't fit comfortably anywhere. And the gray packet of info and cd's supplied with the macbook, just barely fits. I've decided to put this case in a larger computer carrier only because I'm too lazy to return it and because it will add additionaly protection for my macbook in the other carrier. If you intend to use a case for items other than the Macbook, buy something else."
5,Excellent way to provide depth to your knowledge of the time,"This book is an excellent source of information about the war, from the American point of view. Adams provides a detailed look behind the scenes of the American military and political aspects of the war. He does have his biases, but I found that they are easy to identify and in no way took away from the body as a whole. (In my opinion, all historians have biases and it is refreshing to see one that doesn't try to say otherwise.)I highly recommend this book along with other 1812 histories like the books by MacKay Hitsman(Canadian) and Jon Latimer(English)."
1,"terrible, lack of any real research","This writer shows his lack of knowledge with showing a view on different cultures with the view of a small knowledge of history. I am glad I only paid 25 cents for the book at a library that was getting rid of books that did not get used often, In fact this book looked like nobody ever even opened it up. I will say that using it to start a fire in my fireplace it worked ok. Amazing to see how this writer would use his opinion in trying to push his ways, his facts are ridiculous. I looked at his other works online only to think he was a jealous person and attacking many different cultures where they had roots but this writer has none. I doubt anyone would buy this book who has studied history from old books, I wouldn't doubt if he was somehow related to the dictator Ceausescu : )Greetings from Hebrew University, Jerusalem IsraelDov"
5,An Outstanding Overview,"I have read over 400 books on LDS beliefs and this is a Top 25. A must read for all Latter-day Saints. Editor, All About Mormons web site."
2,"Works Fine, Until First Butane Refill","I have a MPL, a gift from Ameritrade, and it worked like a champ all the way until its first refill. I used some Ronson Mult-Fill butane, available at Wal-Mart, to fill it up. It sends a flame like a blow torch, unfazed by the flame setting knob. In just a couple/few uses, it is out again. It is as though something is stuck or jammed fully open. When I checked the web site for warranty instructions, they will fix it but want you to send them a $5 check for shipping, plus pay the shipping and insurance to get it to them. That is at least another ten dollars invested in an item that costs about $25 new, right? If it is working, I give it 5 stars. However, this sinks it to 2 stars for me."
1,shelf pins,they sent the wrong product i need 4 mm pins they sent 5mm and no one has bothered to contact me
5,My favorite hot sauce! Hands down.,"I concur with the other reviewers. It is truly just the right amount of heat. The first time I ever had this sauce was on a steak sub while eating out. I quickly told my wife to try some too. I ended up ordering a few bottles as soon as we got home that day. It had an incredible taste! One great thing about it is that it doesn't have that overwhelming vinegar smell/taste that other sauces do, and besides, I really like African spices. The flavor is amazing. The fact that it has no sodium is just the cherry on the cake because you can use as much or as little as you want and it won't ruin anything. This sauce is hard to find in Florida!"
1,Thief,"Brian denies stealing the melody of his biggest hit (""Anytime,"" 1997) from 1993's ""Outside Your Door"" by Meshell Ndegeocello (listen to a sample at ASIN B0027GYP8S). The song ""Talk To Me,"" which gives credit to Meshell under her birth name, was published in 1991 byVoyceboxing. You will find the same melody on ""Talk To Me"" (1991), which also appears on ""Outside Your Door"" on Meshell's 1993 debut albumPlantation Lullabies. Brian's rip off was released several years later in 1997. Ever since then, McKnight has denied the theft of Meshell Ndegeocello's melody from ""Outside Your Door"" -- the part of the song that makes ""Anytime"" so popular.It's been nearly 15 years. You would think at some point Mr. McKnight would want to clear his conscience and do the right thing."
1,More of the same .........,"Nothing new, still too cool for his own good.You'd never know ""Back At One"" was only two years away."
5,Definitely One Of The Best R&B CDs Ever,"Every song on this CD is good. The songs cover different aspects of emotion, from sadness (""til i get over you""), to determination (""you should be mine""), to love (""the only one for me""), and even death (""when the chariot comes""). ""Anytime"" is a one time number one asking, ""Do I ever cross your mind? Anytime? I miss you!""A must have if you love R&B!"
3,"Can't please all of the public all of the time, so don't try","Brian McKnight is a talented musician, there is no doubt about that. However, with this album, Brian has changed, and it isn't for the better. His love songs, which he was wise to release, are tender. They are also short, and repetitive. What happened to the lenghthy, creative, metaphorical tunes that filled ""I Remember You?"" These songs are hits, but the public is being cheated of Brian's talent. In addition, the up beat tunes are weak. Hooks are repetive, they are just plain pathetic. Brian is doing a good job reaching main stream crowds, if that was his goal. But this album does no justice to his talent and skill."
5,Excellent Album!,"Brian McKnight's smooth vocals, melodickeyboard-based tunes and honest lyrics help define a style of R&B that has been scarce in the '90s. On his third set, McKnight continues to touch the heart with his soulful grooves and heartfelt ballads. Although a guest appearance from Mase on ""You Should Be Mine (Don't Waste Your Time)"" makes for a great pop hit, McKnight's true musical talent and vocal ability replace R&B's usual connection with hip-hop on ANYTIME. Songs like ""Could"" and ""Anytime"" use the slow love song formula while ""Everytime We Say Goodbye"" and ""You Got The Bomb"" remind listeners what smooth up-tempo R&B should sound like."
3,Disapointing,"I had greatly anticipated the release of this album when it came out but i was very disapointed with the outcome. This album is just not live up to his full potential. The title track ""Anytime"" is good, sure. But all of the fast songs are just weak. He is best when it comes to slow ballads. But he redeems himself with ""Back at One""."
3,Stick with ballads,"I can't honestly stand by this album; the fast songs are what hurt him, like ""Hold Me"", which grooves over a 2Pac sample and ""You Should Be Mine"" with Mase. That and cliched lyrics like ""I'm down on my knees/Begging you please"" in ""Show Me the Way Back to Your Heart"". But other ballads like the title track (which sounds a little like Meshell's 1993 ""Outside Your Door""), ""Till I Get Over You"", and ""The Only One for Me"" still make this album a keeper. But for his best work, check out his self-titled album and Back at One."
2,Souled Out For The Sake Of Commercial Success.,"I thought this cd was so wack, that I had to check the cd package to see if this was really Brian McKnight doing the performing on this cd. First off the rip-off jobs he was doing on songs as title track(sounds like the riff to Outside Your Door by, Me'Shell Ndegeocello) and the track The Only One For Me( stealing the riff to the R Kelly remix of I Can't Sleep Baby, yall know what I'm talking about). You Should Be Mine was another let down. And what's up with Jam Knock ? I wish artist like Brian would stick to what they know instead of listening to their A&R reps. I guess I'll just stick to the first two cd's he released. By the way those uptempo cuts on the first two cd's are way better than the crappy ones he's got on the new one. I just can't recommend this to anyone. As a matter of fact, I'm giving him two stars based on his past performances and hoping for a better outing next cd.Peace Xes Cainam"
3,ok,"I thought a few songs were ok, not like the other BK CD's, one song I like on the album is ""When the Chariots Come"""
4,Anytime...is a good time for love,"I like this album it has a very smooth sound. I bought the album because I heard the songs ""Anytime"" and ""The Only One For Me"" and decided that I should peep the album. I didn't waste my money getting it. It's a good album, pick it up. ALSO PICK UP JANET JACKSONS NEW ALBUM THE VELVET ROPE!!!! ITS A MASTERPIECE!!! A CLASSIC!!!"
3,Three at best...,"Although Brian McKnight is one of my favorite artists, this album may have three tracks that I enjoyed at best. ""Anytime"" is a classic McKnight track with good rhythm and typical Brian-like lyrics. It's a nice slow jam that I can listen to for quite some time to come. Another slow jam that seems like a timeless piece to me is ""Show Me The Way Back To Your Heart"". Not only does the song have good lyrics and theme, the melody behind the tune is definitely one that I can enjoy. Even if the song was an intrumental, I can picture myself listening to it for a while. ""The Only One For Me"" is another nice ballad, in typical McKnight style of breezy, smooth sounds. As I've mentioned in other Brian McKnight ratings, he really should stick with ballads and leave the up-tempo stuff to the younger artists. Overall, I can't see myself recommending anyone strongly to obtain this album, but for a cheaper price, it could be a decent addition."
5,"sit back, relax, and listen to dis . . .","if you're lookin for a kewl kick-back cd with a lotta meaning and variety . . . then buy dis cd. most tracks are slow and smooth and then there are a couple dat are more fast-paced, but all-around good. anytime is what first started me out as a brian mcknight fan, and still to dis day my favorite brian mcknight song. you should be mine (featuring mase) is a pretty good song wit a kewl beat and creative lyrics. show me the way back to your heart is one of the better slow songs on dis album. everytime we say goodbye is a slow, but fast kinda song i guess wit a weird yet phat beat. hold me is is very mellow and smooth. the only one for me (one of the released singles of dis album) is one of the best slow songs on this cd mostly for the lyrics. and so on and so on . . . every other song is very good to and just a great cd to just kick back to . . . pure r&b. get dis cd . . ."
2,Unsatisfied,"I bought this item about 6 months ago. It had all the features I wanted, was easy to break down and clean. But it looked cheaply constructed. Now, after 6 months, the lid doesn't seal well, and the handle on the fryer basket has broken, which is a big safety hazard. Next time I will spend a little more money and buy a Cuisinart."
3,Knob broke in one week,"I like it ,but the knob to control the temperature broke in one week,and I am having a hard time finding a know to replace it,it broke in half. made cheap,it seems.I would not buy a rival again."
3,"OK, but could be better","I got this about 9 months ago, but to be honest, I don't use it very much. In fact, I don't think I've used it in 6 months now. While the fryer is OK, I have some issues with it. The timer doesn't work well, to the point where it is pretty useless, I have to use a different timer. It does make very nice fried shrimp, but I have yet to make fries that I found satisfactory, despite many attempts and different recipes. I don't think it gets hot enough, and would have preferred a fryer that went up to 400."
2,Broken handle,"I only used mine 3 times. During the 2nd time, the handle loosened and it broke off during the 3rd use. Rival doesn't have replacement parts. What a shocker. Very disappointing."
4,Parts Problems,"The fryer works very well.BUT: if the basket handle breaks (plastic inside and out), you can not get a replacement. Buy a new fryer or use a basket that does not allow the lid to close are your only choices."
1,Cheap Junk,"Don't waste your money on this product. We purchase this when it first came out and used it maybe 15 times and the handle on the basket broke. If you notice the handle is made to lever up to a horizontal position to lift the basket. The mechanism that locks the basket is already broken and if you try and lift the basket with a load it will collapse and burn you.I'm trying to find a replacement basket since this is just cheap plastic, I doubt that I can fix it."
1,Horrible product,This deep fryer stopped working after 2 months of usage. I called Rival and they sent me a new one which ended up quitting on me after about 5 months. There was nothing wrong with anything on it...it just stopped working. I will never order another one again.
2,Improper temp,"We have had this fryer for a couple years and I always noticed food comes out a little greasy if you fill the basket to a normal level. The reaason is this fryer does not get hot enough. If I set it to 375 and wait 15 minutes, then check the temp of the oil, it's 325. Would never buy again."
1,Had 2 of them die after 1 use!!!!,"I ordered this deep fryer and it seemed like it would be great. I especially liked the fact that you could wash it. We got it home, used it the 1st time and it worked great. The next time I went to use it, nothing.....it would not heat up at all. Amazon.com was great and sent me out a new one right away without it costing me a penny. So, we set up the second one and the extact same problem happened again! One time use, then nothing!!! Amazon.com was great once again and refunded my money and paid for the return shipping. I would not suggest that anyone buy this fryer!!!!"
1,Unreliable,"The second time I used this fryer it stopped working in the middle of cooking. I cooked one batch of fries and as I removed them I noticed the power light had gone off. I did all the trouble-shooting stuff and still no power. I allowed it to cool down and still no power. I followed the instruction booklet carefully the two times that I used this fryer and it died in the midst of it's second use. Since there doesn't seem to be a reasonable explanation,it's being returned."
2,Does not cover NIO for networking,"I will agree with the other reviewers that this is a really well written book.However, it does not cover using the NIO (java 1.4) networking API which is much faster and more efficient. So this book is very useful if you are still having to write for java 1.3.But if you are writing for java 1.4 (or 1.5), then it has some useful stuff - but does not cover anything about how to handle the actual network communication."
4,Worth Reading!,"If you are interested in Network Programming and would like to get a good grip over it, this definitely is one of the books that you can start off with and add to your collection.I used it as a course requirement a year ago and still use it as a reference, just to stay connected with the topics.I would not term this as the 'best' network programming book out there (especially for Java beginners ), but I am happy I've purchased and read it."
1,this book doesn't live up to its title,"The title of this book is misleading, 80 percent of its contents can be found in sun's online documents,the coverage on CORBA and RMI is a joke. ""java network for dummies"" may be a better title. all the examples given in this book refects the author(s)'s understanding of networks is sub-skin deep. if you are a serious java network developer, buy Doug Lea 's book and don't waste your money on this one."
2,Wait... and look for a better book in the market,Please dont get carried away by the wonderful reviews for this book by some readers. This is an expensive book but definitely not worth the money. The book should be named Java I/O programming rather than a network related title.Most of the book deals with Java streams and the network concepts are very few. At some point the book looks like an API reference than a full fledged text. This info is available in Java Docs for free . The font selected for printing the book is a real turn off. Another disaster from Manning .I will suggest reading Java Network programming title form O'Reilly which is due for release in July 2000 ( do not buy the 1997 edition ).
4,Good Show,"A lower tier WWE pay per view, but still a great show. The main event was good. I bought this to add to my collection, and it was a good find."
1,Disappointed after several years,"I've owned my EZ-Scan 6000 for about seven years now. Went to help a friend and realized that I didn't have the latest software to scan newer vehicles -- no big deal, I figure I'll just update my unit. I tried to download the software and realized that the EZ-PC 500 software doesn't work on Windows 7 x64. Updated the EZ-PC 500 software on my old Windows XP machine, and downloaded the unit's software, only to find it doesn't support vehicles newer than 07. No, I didn't make a mistake, the release notes for the v4.07 say the last update was for the 06 & 07 model years."
1,msa backyard mech,"Buyer be ware, Bought this item a couple of years ago and serves its purpose. However when I went to update it with my current laptop the driver does not work & laptop won't recognize it! Contacted tech support & was told (The AutoXray software is not compatible with Windows 7. You would need to use a pc with an older version of Windows to use the software)this is the exact E-Mail response. Asked about possibility of updated driver & was told that (non are planned When the tool and pc software was written Microsoft had not released Windows 7. We cannot be held responsible for Microsoft not making their systems compatible with prior releases.) find a older computer with a older operating system. So if you are planning on buying this with the intentions of updating it or downloading data to a newer computer DON'T."
1,Stay away from AutoXray,"I purchased the EZ-Scan 6000 directly from SPX, the manufacturer, through an upgrade offer on my original EZ-Link. The unit was received without the software disk which is supposed to be included with of the EZ-Scan Tool Kit. I had to call tech support to have it shipped to me. Once received, I tried to boot up the unit. I won't boot up, instead only whistles with no display then shuts off. (I suspect that I was sent a refurbished or returned unit, not a new one.) Once again a call to tech support service, When they receive this unit back they will send me a new one. Let's hope it works or it will show on my credit card before before I have a working unit."
2,Autoxray 6000 Supoport,"Support for the AUTOXRAY is non-existent, email discontinued, fax no longer valid, software update for WIN 7 non-existent.AutoXray 6000 EZ-Scan ScannerVery poor customer service. The device is not supported by the manufacturer."
4,Took them awhile to get used to it...,"I have 4 cockatiels that were used to the fruit flavored pellets. We switched to this primarily because we were concerned about them getting proper nutrition, but also because they are very picky and would 'throw' one or two of the flavors out of their bowl, leaving a constant mess on our floor (LOL).Even though we mixed this in with their regular food, they resisted this more than any other food transition we've done with them. It got to the point where we had to almost go cold turkey with this (we monitored them to make sure they weren't starving), and when they finally got hungry enough, they ate it. Fast-forward a few months later and they're all eating it. I can't say I notice a huge change in their energy or well-being, but I at least know they are getting proper nutrition with their pellets now and there's DEFINITELY far less of a mess on the floor these days ;)"
3,pretty good episode,"Why do I say three stars? Well, maybe its because I;ve seen it so many times. But, I think Q was a bit obnoxious ( isn't he always?) But, he talks about the cromes of humanity yada yada yada, so why does he even bother if he thins humans are beyond saving? Some parts are funny concerning Q, and the cast had some grea aacting. It was interesting see Picard going back and forth in time and doing a pretty good job of it!"
2,Another bad album,I cant decide if this album or Pure Instict is their worst. THis album is the most experimental they have ever done and they dont sound like classic and old (best) Scorpions. THey sound pop (ridiculous and for girls music). Stay away.
1,Zero Star Rating,"The Scorpions album Eye II Eye is their worst album. Klaus Meine thinks he's become Bono from U2. As bad as the song ""To Be No. 1"" is, the video is even worse. The Scorpions completely abandon their blue collar roots for the art-house crowd. The music sounds like background music you would hear on the PA while shopping at the grocery store. I wish zero stars were allowed as an Amazon rating, and this would deserve it. This review could have been more harsh, but I still consider myself a Scorpions fan."
4,Different but good,"OK, this isn't the typical Scorpions. There are about five songs on here that I really like. Overall I like the CD though I wish there were a few more hard rockin tunes on it. If you listen with an open mind, you'll see that this is still better than most of the music out there."
1,"After 25 years, what happened?","Many years I've been a true Scoripon's fan and listed to all they've put out, and I have to say this is the worst album I've ever heard. The reason is, even though the Scorpions are a true rock and roll band, they need to put out what they know is good, not this light rock crap! They have put out excellent love ballads and rock, but not on this album. Yes, I am still a true Scorpions fan, but I was very dissapointed with this album!"
1,BAD!!! REALLY GOD AWFUL!,"There almost seems to be a pattern, for Eye II Eye, One decent song followed by some horrible ballads, the Scorps are trying(BUT FAILING)to sound trendy with drum loops-electronic beats. Really BAD!"
1,STAY AWAY From this disc - If you like the Scorpions,"Unbelievable!! This disc is HORRIBLE!!! Filled with boring lite rock and no emotion. The ballads are even bad. All of the ""faster"" songs have a complete different dance beat. This thing completey puts the nail in the coffin of a once great band. DO NOT BUY THIS DISC!!!! SEND A MESSAGE TO THE BAND TO HANG IT UP!!!!!"
2,Crap at last sting,"I realize the Scorpions have been rocking and rolling the world for 20+ years, but what the hell is this...? I think they've been listening to the Back Street Boys & N-Sync too much! Yeah, there are a couple of decent tunes here, but they are trying way to hard to appeal to the masses. Using those eletronic drum machines - where is Herman Rarebell when you need him? The music seems heavily influenced by the movie ""Night at the Roxy"". These tunes are almost danceable. Who said ""change"" is good. This sucks. Scorps should stick to waht they know... ROCK & ROLL."
1,Garbage!!!!!,It's sad to see such a great band put out such crap. Peter Wolf was obviously the worst choice for producer and it really shows. I am at a loss of words to really describe how dissapointing this cd is.
1,A Rock Band that doesnt play songs that Rock.,"This really doesnt sound anything like what they have done in the past. I have all thier records, even from the early days like Lonesome Crow, but this really isnt up to 'Crazy World' which I thought was thier worst effort up to this point."
4,This record is really good,"I really enjoyed listening to this record.Great songs are e.g.""ten lightyears away"" and""what you give"""
2,This is not a good album,"No, it ain't. First of all, it isn't heavy metal (or even hard rock). The Scorps' trademark mixture of rockers'n'ballads is gone. What we get is mostly commercialized pop of questionable quality. Some of the songs are just plain awful, not to mention ludicrous (""Priscilla"" is a song about a cockroach - I mean, boys, get real!). The only thing that saves this record from being a total catastrophy is that some of the ballads (""Eye to Eye"", ""Yellow Butterfly"") are actually pretty good. But the heavy metal glue that keeps it all together is lacking. For people who loved Scorpions' earlier masterpieces (""In Trance"", ""Taken by Force"", ""Lovedrive"",""Blackout"", ""Love at First Sting"") this album will be a huge disappointment."
1,Ewwwwwwww,"This is cleary the worst Scorpions album ever made. Don't get me wrong, I love the Scorpions but the band is way off kilter during the making of this transistional album, instead of just going by pure instinct and feel. Don't buy this record if your a die hard Scorpions fan during the Blackout/Love at First Sting era. You will be very disapointed."
2,Stick to what you do best...,"There are bands ever capable of reinventing themselves,like U2 and Metallica,unfortunately the Scorpions are not in this category-their recent attempt at doing just that testifies:the bad boys are not running wild anymore...because they've become the Backstreet Boys!"
1,BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD!!!!!!!!!!!,"Oh,this one is worst then BACKSTREET BOYS.I don't know what happend to the guys,but the music on this cd is just awfull.Do not buy it."
1,"No, No, No bad scorpions","What were they thinking? Blackout, Love at first sting, Eye to Eye? No, No, No. This is not the scorpions. How could they do this? This is not even a sellout...Techno pop? I am so confused. Help!!Their next album better rock so hard if they ever want my attention again. I'm shattered..."
2,Not a very good Scorpions CD...,"I think that the guys wanted to mellow out and try a different style of music. That is not a bad thing is essence but it was for me and probably the vast majority of their fans. Let's face it, it is natural for fans to want their fav bands to continue the same style of music. If a rapper decided to do country, he too would come up against the same criticism as are the scorpions now. I do think that the previous album, Pure Instinct, was the best album ever for them simply because it was a very solid album with very strong songs (all but one I loved) and who could not love Wild Child!I encourage you to check out Pure Instinct here on Amazon and read the reviews. I think the vast majority agree with me on this one."
2,WHAT ! Is this the Scorpions?,"Being an ""old school"" Scorps fan since the ""Lovedrive"" days, I can't believe this is the Scorpions. After listening a few times, I found a few jems, but not many. I suppose when I'm in the Nursing Home, it will be a better alternative than elevator music, or KZZZ Radio. Venture if you must, but a warning the all old schoolers, prepare to be disappointed. For the newcomers, The Scorps have WAY better stuff to offer."
2,Not the worst but...,"This album probably means a great zero for every diehard Scorpion fan.The tunes are commercial as they've never been and simply disappointing.I wouldn't even call this a ""rock"" album, but hardened commercial music.It's only slightly better than all this funky stuff you can find all around."
3,"As Scorpions albums go, this is weak but tolerable","As Scorpion albums go this album is weak, but tolerable at least til the next one. The album/CD sounds like the band were attempting to obtain some radio interest or airplay and wanted to please the new label."
5,"Great, Fresh approach by the timeless Scorpions!","This is quite a different adventure for the multi- million record selling German legends. Instead of trying to sound like every other album, they take a chance. A great disc for Scorps or non-scorps fans alike!"
2,What the heck is this?,"I am getting tired of bands that are trying to change their music to flow with the times. Yes there are some decent songs on this cd, but overall it is their worst effort in a while. If you want a great Scorpions album get the one that came out before this one 'Pure Instinct' that is probably their best album ever, yes better than 'blackout' and 'love at first sting'. THis album has way too many tempo and 'un-Scorp' like tunes and simply does not have enough hard stompin' songs to keep anyones interest long enough. This is definitely only for true Scorp fanatics. Again there are a couple good songs just not enough of them, here they are: Mysterious, Eye To Eye, Skywriter, Du Bist So Schmutzig, Aleyah......remeber I WARNED you!"
1,"What have you done, Scorps?","This is for sure not the best Scorpions album (I don't want to say ""the worst"" because I am a big Scorpions fan . . . but let's say it: it is the worst). It is the same as Slang for Def Leppard: a transition album with bad results. For me, the period of glory for the Scorps was between 1979 and 1991; Crazy World closed 12 extraodinary years, which started with Lovedrive. Although Pure Instinct was not a bad album, the pop direction was obvious, but Eye to Eye was too much. I like very much the record with the Berlin Orchestra, but I believe that the Scorps are trying to survive thanks to their old hits. Acoustica is a good example, isn't it? Will we hear a new Blackout style album? I hope so."
4,"Slightly disappointed, but NEW Scorpions gonna make it.",This album is not bad though I still miss the OLD Scorpions
2,Scorpions were stingless in this effort,"I've been a fan since the late 70's and throught their career they have made great stuff.This album sounds like they just started out in a garage in Germany.Heavy Metal/Industrial for a group like this doesn't exist.I had the remote pleasure to listen to this at a friends house and I said ""Who the hell is this?"" My friend replied that it was the Scorpions latest and I rolled my eyes.To some people maybe this album will grow on you in time and perhaps the second is listenable but while you guys are enjoying that,I'll play Unbreakable now there's a welcome relief."
2,This is not the Scorpions,"This is their evil twins that somehow have taken over, and decided to ruin their career.Scorpions is one of the greatest hard rock bands still producting music. Yet, instead of making hard rock here, they tried to make cheap pop music. Some of the tracks sounds like the drums are replaced by the demo presets of a cheap synthesizer.It is however one track that stands out here. A Moment In A Million Years is a masterpiece of a ballad. However, it isn't a band effort. It doesn't have either drums nor guitars. It is only Klaus with a backing of piano and violin.The scorpions have released exactly 20 records as we speak, and this one is uncontested as the worst one."
3,Mixed feelings.,"Hmmm...I've been listening to the Scorpions since the In Trance/Vigin Killer years (1976), and have loved every album...except this one. This is a very strange mix of rock, metal, and dance I guess you would call it. There are definate European techno influences on Eye II Eye. Klaus has the vocals to be sure...sounds the same now as he did 15 years ago. The album is not a total loss, there as some tracks that I really like, and some I wish they wouldn't have recorded. They tried something different, but alienated many of their lifelong fans. They need to get back to their hard rock roots with their next one...if there is one. If you are new to the Scorpions, skip this one. If you are an old fan, listen to some of the clips or borrow a listen before you slap down your cash."
5,wow- fantastic album,Take Scorpions off the cover of this album and it would probably be a smash hit. Great music people is great no matter who is singing it. Great blend of old and new. Listen to this one!
3,What have U done 2 your music???,"What if the Scorpions tried to be a boy band? Wow, that would would be hilarious, wouldn't it?!In fact, it might sound something like ""Mysterious"" or ""10 Light Years Away."" And wouldn't it really be funny if they started abbreviating their song titles like ""What U Give U Get Back."" I suppose we all had fair warning with a title like ""Eye II Eye.""How could I possibly rank this album at 3 stars if they did something so dreadfully funny as all this? Because three of the songs are bold and lively: Mind Like A Tree, Yellow Butterfly and Freshly Squeezed. Oh, and it's hard not to like a metal song with german lyrics, so Du Bist So Schmutzig gets this worthy mention.Eye II Eye is the fruit of a great metal band going through a horribly embarrassing mid-life crisis. Join in and be embarrassed too! What will they think of next? An orchestral album? Sure! It'll _never_ happen..."
2,What is this stuff?,"Woah... From blistering hella good guitar rifts to this hardly rock, pop stuff--one can only ask: what where they thinking? There is really no song on this album where you get a feel for what the Scorpions are actually known and loved for: their heavy, driving beats and melodic harmonies. I am a HUGE Matthias Jabs fan, and I don't even hear one guitar solo on this album where he really gets to show his amazing talent. Where are all the guitars? Where's the rock? Where are the Scorpions?!"
1,True Scorp Fans Need Not Apply!,"Very disappointed. What a sell out. If you like the old stuff, you will hate this CD. What happened guys? Stick to the music your true fans love. This makes me sad. After listen to this CD, I realized that I will never get that 45 minutes back."
3,Shocking!!,"As you can see by all the other reviews here, either you'll like it, or you'll hate it. At first listen, I too, was like, what the heck is this?!! By second listen it began to grow on me. Scorpions are trying something radically different which I commend them for. The Scorpions first ""pop-sounding"" record. I've got all of their records since Lonesome Crow and have often thought of them as the German Led Zeppelin. It has been very amusing to read all the bad reviews this album has got and had I wrote this after first listen, I might have concurred. I like this album, but I'm not sure I want them to continue with this sound. That was U2's downfall: they changed their sound and stayed with it. If next album somehow fuses the guitar virtuosity they're known for it should be very interesting. Keep an open mind and definitely give it more than one listen if you're unsure about this one. It will grow on you."
3,The old west meets a modern day women !,This book tells a story of two witches back 1882 and a modern day women who makes her living around other's sexually fantasies. Most of the book takes place in the old west with a hot-steaming cowboy and modern-day Elizabeth with a twist of time-travel. You will enjoy this fun read - take a chance I was hooked. I am off to find more books by this author.
3,"Well, S&G is S&G...","...but frankly, I'd rather stick with the Collected Works set; it's more focused, and I don't really feel I need the obscurities--plus, some songs from their albums are excluded. How cool is that?"
3,Great music (duh!) but not a very good compilation,"I mean, as far as state of the art compilations go, anyway. Check out the Coltrane Classic Quartet or Miles' 1965-68 Quintet compilations - these are real winners as far as I'm concerned. I was very disappointed by the lack of information on the recording sessions and their sidemen and with as fine a poet as Paul Simon, you would think that the lyrics for all of these tunes would have been included. Frankly, I'm also disappointed that the other reviews on the Amazon site (as of 1/08/07) are both five stars. It seems like the reviewers were only complimenting themselves on their recent, pricey purchase. It seems irresponsible to the Amazon community to me."
4,Eastern Suns liscious,"a verry eastern aproach to the beautifle suns of arqa collection. Features bass, sitar, tamboura, santuri[hammer dulcimer], violin, and electronics/keyboards but no real dub lots of percussion/tablas. If you do want to hear dub versions of this you have to get the total eclipse of the sun disc. fans of ravi shankar, zakir hussain, ustad sultan khan, laswell, ali akbar khan, tabla beat science, genetic drugs, blue flame, hans christian,"
5,Great old country music,"I knew of Hank Williams Sr. I didn't realize how much of his songs I was familar with until I saw a show of his life. Oh, and he was way before my time. I'm 28, but I love his twang. Great old-fashioned country from the king of country music."
5,"Hank, o hank","I am not a country music fan, in fact, I hate country music. I have never heard of Hank Williams until now. In fact, I heard of him in the news when they were doing a report on whether or not men can be faithful and if women can forgive. Anyways, in the commercial for the report, they were playing ""Your cheating heart"", and my dear old mom, who can't sing, started singing the song day and night. Killed my beloved pug, not to mentioned she cracked a window or two with her singing. So, I looked the song title up on the internet and whamo, its on Amazon.com, wouldn't you know, and is cheaper than going to the regular music store, you know (Blockluster, Wearhouse, Music Tracer. Anyways, to make a long story short, I only listened to ""Your cheating heart"" is good"
5,Classic,Anybody who likes Hank Williams will love this album. Classic Hank (tear jerker songs) Wonderful country poetry lyrics. This album has been remastered beautifully. Enjoy!
5,Gift,Hank has been a family standby for more than 40 years....second generation up and running w/ him now! Good job.
5,Amazon is Great,"I can't write about the music as this was a gift, but I can write about how easy and fast the whole Amazon experience is/was. Received merchandise as promised, when it was promised. Will continue to buy from Amazon.com"
4,Hank made a lot of great music!,"Listening to this CD brought back a lot of memories of some great songs. I had forgotten how many songs Hank wrote. The quality of the recording is pretty decent, considering that some of the music was originally recorded a long time ago. There's quite a number of songs that have been recorded by others later, but Hank was the guy who wrote them..."
4,great,Was glad to find this on your website----Hank Williams is one of those performers that will live on in the music industry forever. He's timeless and so is this cd if you are a Hank fan like my husband and I are. Well worth the money for this one
1,Tech. trouble,"I bought this twice, because the first download didn't work. Second one didn't either. I have seven of the 20 songs. Won't be buying unless I am getting one song at a time."
1,Tai Chi Reflections,"I just purchased... a companion CD in the Serenity Series titled ""Tai Chi Reflections."" I listened to it last night and decided to write a review on it - strictly a public service because I would not want another hapless soul to waste [any money] on the same CD. Oddly, Amazon.com no longer lists it in its catalogue although I purchased it from them only two weeks ago. ""Tai Chi Reflections"" is every bit as bad as ""Tai Chi Meditations"" appears to be. It is supposed to be the sound of a waterfall accompanied by music. The waterfall sounded exactly like somebody had turned on the spigot in the bathtub and recorded it. I gave it three minutes before ripping it out of the CD player and tossing it in the trash. Somebody should have reflected longer."
1,Not Very Appealing,As a Tai Chi practitioner I found this CD to be annoyingly repetitive. More like a soundtrack loop with nature sounds added. I gave my copy away.
5,A great little seen CD,"This CD is so hard to find. But, it is really very good. The song ""Small Town"" is amazing. I had this as a tape and wore it out. Try it out, you'll love it."
3,GOOD but not any Seminole Wind,It is a good album for the John Anderson fan and fun to listen to. Seminole Wind is still his best album !
5,A magical fantasy journey!,"WINTERTIDE is a highly imaginative, complex tale combining Science Fiction, Fantasy and Romance - although the hero and heroine are separated throughout most of the book, when they do finally come together it is a satisfying joining of two hearts and souls that belong together. I highly recommend WINTERTIDE to readers looking for a fast-paced, unusual, dark and dangerous story about sorcerers, wizards, demons, and the power of love to conquer all."
5,"More curved pieces, More switches, MORE FUN!","THE SWITCHES that come with the Tracktown Railway starter set both go in the same direction. However, the switches that come with this kit go in opposite directions, adding to the flexibility of layouts that can be created.THE CURVES ARE ESSENTIAL especially if you have already added straghts to your system.THE BRIDGES are great... my daughter LOVES to watch the train go across them."
3,GeoTrak tracks,"Tracks were OK. Thought there would be more in the package for the money. The original packet of toys (Grand Central Station set) was great but this additional set was a bit of a disappointment with so few tracks, etc."
4,from MainlyPiano.com,"""In The Key of Love"" is pianist Ted Brabham's third release this year. This one is a collection of love songs played in more of an easy-listening style than ""new age."" Brabham's piano is accompanied by synth orchestrations. While a lot of the song selections are pretty standard, Brabham's arrangements are fresh and very enjoyable to listen to. Standards include ""My Heart Will Go On,"" ""The Way We Were,"" ""Love Story,"" ""Send In the Clowns,"" ""A Time For Us,"" and ""Memory."" A few of the less frequently heard pieces are Barry Manilow's ""When the Meadow Was Bloomin',"" ""Tell Him, "" and ""Chinatown"" - my favorite tracks. Brabham also does a great job with ""If,"" ""Lost Without Your Love,"" and ""The Rainbow Connection."" That last title was a surprise, but it works well in the collection and is indeed a love song. So if you're in the mood for some old romantic favorites played on the piano with light orchestrations, this is a good choice."
1,"An ""elevator music"" classic","This cd is alright as a gag, and it has ""camp"" value, but musically speaking it's dullsville, and is the type of music you hear in shopping malls, in the background, this is ginuine ELEVATOR MUZAK!"
2,"Its a sleeper, alright!","In fact, it may well put you to sleep! I agree with the S. Berner review and would add the narrator had a definite negative impact on the book. While using a narrator may be a clever idea in some instances, here it detracts. We had no idea who this narrator was until about a third of the way in. The use of British idioms was annoying but finally made some sense when we find out the nationality of the narrator. This is essentially a story about a non-story, that is, there is nothing to it. It is really unfortunate for Mesce has written another one about Major Harry Voss, an interesting character, but Mesce fails to do anything with him. Simply not worth the effort to read all the way through to the ho-hum conclusion."
2,Unfullfilled,"This started out as a good story filled with mystery and intrigue. A little over halfway through when I expected it to really start getting good, it died. This story dove faster than the P-47 in the opening. The second half of the story waned and the ending had no closure. I hope future novels by these authors will learn by these shortcomings."
1,Didn't get it,"This book had an authentic feel for the period. But I felt I just didn't get the story. The main character always seems to have a thought that the solution is hidden somewhere in the info he has gathered, but never seems to figure out the details of the crime. Several of the characters are developed, then drop out of the narrative. I found it to be a very unsatisfying book that I could have put down half way through and known just about as much as I did by finishing it."
2,What Am I Missing?,"Sometimes I think I'm living in a Twilight Zone World. Here are all these raves for The Advocate, and I think: ""I must have read another book!"" This WWII ""thriller"" contains No Characters (only physical types); no suspense (We are shown a situation at the beginning that appears clear on the surface, but... underneath... is EXACTLY as it seems); No surprises (see previous entry); and offers the ""astonishing"" plot twist that says high ranking officers in the military may be driven by ulterior motives. WHAT A SWITCH! As for the WWII setting, it is just that, a setting. Mentioning brand, and other, names and slipping in historical references, does NOT ""evoke"" a period. And THE NARRATOR!? What possible reason exists for his belated, meaningless, and pointless role that couldn't be served by simple third person???? Like I say, I must have read a different book from the one being hyped. Ya' think?"
1,A total waste of time,I just want to associate myself with the review by S. Berner. I couldn't believe how boring the whole thing was.
4,Ok belt,"I have had this belt for a little over a year and I am seeking to replace it now. The belt has started to fall apart which causes me to wonder if it is real leather. When new, the belt gives you an edge in fashion; it's literally four belts in one."
5,love it,"I bought this belt for my boyfriend and we both love it. The leather is quality leather and looks expensive. The buckle itself is also ""reversible"" and you can choose one of two designs for the front. It's a great belt!"
4,A nice solid watch,"I bought this for my husband, and he is so pleased with it. It's exactly what he wanted, and it looks like it was worth much, much more."
1,Horrible product. Absolutely horrible customer service.,"First off, this set isn't anything close to marble. It's plastic (I should have known for the price)...but not even good plastic--it's painted plastic. The paint is smeared in most places and it looks to be the quality of something a 10 year old might paint or something you find at the dollar store.I contacted the seller about returning the item with no response. Amazon had to file a claim in my behalf and I'm still waiting for the refund so I can return the item."
5,THE BEST OF THE BEST,RICKY VAN SHELTON IS TRULY BLESSED WITH THE BEST VOICE IN COUNTRY MUSIC. HE CAN SING ANYTHING AND IT COMES OUT BEAUTIFUL. THERE IS NO ONE THAT CAN COMPARE TO HIM. I CAN LISTEN TO HIM 24 HOURS A DAY AND NEVER TIRE OF HEARING HIS SONGS.
5,Fun trivia!,We got this game as a gift and so far everyone who's played it has had fun. Great for big groups of people - even those who don't generally like trivia games get into this one! Moves quickly since everyone answers each question. Fun game!
3,The Black Lyon,I pick this book because I wanted a good but quick romance. It's start with a marriage proposal right off the back and i kept thinking how is this going to work they will already be married lol. this book surprise me every turn . very good plot and it kept me going! compare to some other Jude Deveraux book it was goood but I read some other book of her that kept my interest more . that why i gave it a 3 star very good but not excellent.
5,Timeless Romance Classic!,I first snuck this book as a teen in the 1980s. It was one of the first romance novels I ever read and has remained my all-time favorite romance novel.
3,The book was good but average plot.,"The book was well wtitten even though this is a similar plot in many romances,but I found myself warming to the characters. If you like a romance thats like many others, this book is 4 you."
2,I almost could not finish this book,"As has been said in other reviews, I was really enjoying the first chapters, the hero and herione. And then he starts brooding on his first marriage and attacking the herione without cause. Her staying with him through it all was too weak for me. Fortunately the author was able to bring the hero to some redemption, but I could not and still can not get the images of the early meaness out of my head. It really was a spoiler to the ""love"" story. I have not read any of this author before now and if not for some of the other reviewers saying she was a good author I probably would not want to read any other of her books. For fairness sake I guess I will try some more by her and hope she was just off her game in this one."
3,I really wanted this to be better.,"It was an enjoyable book as a whole, but one I will not keep. The first third of this book is amazing. It was love at first site for the fearsome Black Lyon and his Lioness, the woman who tames him.HOWEVER, Jude Deveraux has unfortunately written a book about misunderstandings, and mistrust. A writer can write about those things, but very few can nail it with a crafty tale and overlook those individual things and mold them into a story. At times the book went too quick, then too slow. But I did enjoy the love that was shared between the two while the big misunderstandings were not the head of the story. This medieval does not compare to a Julie Garwood."
2,"HONESTLY, I WAS DISSAPOINTED","I didn't like this book. I read the first four chapters but I still haven't finished it. It was so boring and unlike all her novels i've read. I guess I can't judge it until I finish the whole book. I'm going to edit this review until I finish it. But for now, I'm rating it 2 stars. The problem is Lyonene and Ranulf. i can't feel the love between them. I didn't like the way Mrs. Deveraux portrayed Lyonene character--too childish and talks like a child. I can't describe what really let me down, but I sure know if the book is great or not. This book is not one of Jude Deveraux best."
2,one stupid heroine,"It was alright until 3/4 of the book. The author makes the heroine out to be soooo stupid about the case with Amicia. She KNEW the woman can't be trusted but she persists in her stupidity by not asking outright of Ranulf if his supposed unfaithfulness is true or not when she has the chance. I mean, even Ranulf questions her why she was troubled! Stupid, stupid, stupid! Because of her stupidity, she allows herself to be caught in Amicia's deviousness.I can't handle stupid heroines just so the book can be longer. I call that bad story writing."
2,The Black Lyon is a black spot,"After reading all her other wonderful novels, this one is surely a disappointment. It is glaringly obvious that this was one of her FIRST (which I took into account) The reasons for the hero's dislike/distrust of the heroine were weak and not at all believable. This guy didn't deserve the heroine's love and I would have liked to see him grovel a bit more for her forgiveness, and their emotions towards each other (""do I really love him/her?"")were annoying. Of course, having said that, Jude Devereaux is one of my favorite authors. Thank god she, just like Johanna Lindsey, just keeps on improving!"
3,Plodding,Just a bit slow. She must have been paid by the word. What does Bernie Rhodenbarr have to do with book? Nothing.
4,Beautiful love story,"Love at first sight. Then life begins. A tale of falling in love, hardships and joys. A strong masculine man meets a beautiful young woman and she melts away years of walls built around his heart."
3,"Great price, Good read","I had reservations about reading this story. I really don't like women being abused or hit by men. In this story I could see where the Black Lyons poor treatment of Lyonene was coming from. Though she definately did not diserve it. I loved the way his love for her developed, and the outcome of the story."
5,Black Lyon is Great,If you want a fun read start with The Black Lyon. This is a stand alone story if you are not interested in a series.The other books that follow in the Bernie Rhodenbarr Mysteries are not nearly as good as The Black Lyon.
1,UGH!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is THEE WORST JUDE DEVERAUX BOOK EVER! I cannot believe she created a character (supposedly the ""hero"") like Ranulf. Not only does his name [stink] but so does his domineering, pig-headed, insulting, ugly attitude. He can barely bring himself to compliment his wife, even when she's pregnant. He disgusted me with his hateful jealousy and temper.Not that Lyonene was any better, putting up with a man that rapes her twice, hits her to the ground, and basically ruins her wedding day.Why Jude, WHY????? I am so so so disappointed at this book. I can't believe the same person that wrote AKISA could write this [junk]. ..."
3,The Lyon Review,The Black Lyon is not one of Jude Deveraux's best works. Ranulf de Warbrooke is an arrogant character who is mean and thoughtless. Lyonene is also a thoughtless character who runs in circles in the story. She is not a belivable character. The supporting characters in the story are more cunning and witty then the two leading characters. I love Jude Deveraux books. The setting and atmosphere is perfect in The Black Lyon but the lead characters are lacking.
5,The Black Lyon by Jude Deveraux,"I've read all Jude Deveraux's books. This book is the beginning of the ""Velvet"" books by her about the Montgomery family. This book is the perfect beginning of the story line. Like all her books, this one has mystery, romance (pretty explicit but tastefully done), adventure & humor. If you like this book and have not continued with the ""Velvet Promise) etc., do, you'll be glad."
2,The Black Lyon,I was very disappointed in this book. Plot was sketchy and characters were boring. I never finished the book. A disappointment from a good author!
3,An uninspiring romance,"This was my first Jude Deveraux romance and I was disappointed with it! It is supposed to be a ""love at first sight"" romance but it failed in pulling me into the story and actually feeling for the characters. My indifference continued throughout the book, even up to the kidnapping and rescue of Lyonene, and I finished the book with the feeling that my ""work"" was over. (Well, I had paid for the story..)"
2,Big disappointment!,"I have not finished reading this book yet, but I just could not wait to voice my disappointment. I am a big fan of Jude Devereaux and seriously cannot believe that this is a fruit of her work. The dialogues are lame, the chapters don't hold together. And the hero (Black Lyon)...; don't even get me started there. That the heroine of the story not only puts up with him but also is madly in love with, is beyond my comprehension. She must be mentally unstable herself. Unfortunately, I have a bad habit of reading all the books through no matter what the content. It looks like I will suffer for the next 78 pages. Do yourself a favor and get a different book."
2,I was greatly disappointed with this book,"I am a guy who likes to read a romance novel every now and then. I just finished a Nora Roberts book and really enjoyed it. I had high hopes for this novel. I have heard alot about what a great writer Deveraux is and how her books sell millions, so I picked up this one. I could not believe how boring this book was and how bland the characters were throughout the story.This novel was written in 1980 and maybe her talent was not there yet (I never read Deveraux before) when she wrote this particular story. I didn't even finish this book, it moved to slow and had nothing to offer as far a plot is concerned.So why not just one star. The history part of the story was accurate and gave a sense of the 1300-1400's and I like history. I have not given up on Deveraux, but I hope the next book I pick in better than this one."
2,Doesn't Compare,"I have read quite a few of Jude Deveraux's books and was sincerely disappointed in this one. I went off of everyone's majority of reviews on this site and was anticipating a good read. Unfortunately, I felt that the lady described in the book was a bit on the abused side, especially from the man that she loved. Although this is just my opinion, I like it better when the heroine is not hit by her lover and not told what she should be feeling. But if you like the simpering, defenseless types then you will sure enjoy this one."
1,A real disappointment!,"I was so excited to find this book, after reading references to a belt with a black lyon in Velvet Song, but I was very disappointed when I read this book. It was the first J.D. book that I have ever had trouble finishing. In fact, I gave up, after becoming so bored and disgusted with the characters. What kind of a hero knocks a woman around several times, only to have her vow to win his love. Talk about disfunctional!! I chalk this up to the fact that it was one of her first books! I do not recommend this book. For a good read, try ""Rememberance"", ""Sweet Liar"" or ""A Knight in Shining Armour""."
3,If this had a sequel I would give it 5 stars!,This was a very good story all the way thru until the end. What happened to Morell and Amica? Did I miss something? Were they slaughtered by Ranulf's knights or did they get away? They were a huge part of the story and I think the author should let us in on what happened to them. Unless this has a sequel. Then I want to know the title!
2,Ho-hum.,"This was my second attempt at reading this book. The first time, about 12 years ago, I thought it was very clumsy, long, and boring. I enjoyed it more the second time, I think mostly because my knowledge of the historical era it is set in has grown, but also because it has more story and less steamy parts. That is a way my reading tastes have changed in the last decade.Overall, however, this is your average romance story. Misunderstandings abound, heroine is feisty, hero is a rogue who must be tamed, heroine is kidnapped and must be rescued by the hero, heroine is poor, hero is rich, etc. The clothing, activities and settings of the medieval era are well researched and well depicted in the story, so that is encouraging. Both villains made me want to puke, which I suppose means they were accurately portrayed. I guess I was just left with an overall 'ho-hum' feeling after reading this book. Wasn't great, didn't suck."
4,Lion's Belt,"This is one of Jude Deveraux first books and I have loved it since the moment I read it. I do find Lyon ""Ranulf"" to be a little rough on his lady love but understand that it was set back in a time where things like this happened and a man could treat his wife any way he wants. Lyon has some issues with his past that he has to overcome and eventually does. I do think Lyonnene was a young girl who falls for the mysterious stranger that everyone else finds scary. I didn't enjoy the ship wrecked stranger coming into the book and felt she just addded pages for the book and not enjoyment. I love the story line being set back in medival times and love books from that era. All in all I have enjoyed this book and re-read it occassionally."
4,Nice historical fiction,I enjoyed this story very much and finished it in no time. I would have given it 5 stars but the lord's character grated on my nerves a few times to the point where I almost wanted his wife to go back home to her family. But he got it together by the middle of the book.
5,Heart warming and young at heart!!,"I started COLLECTING!!!Judes books when I became pregnant 6 years ago in a small town with only one book store. I have found and kept everyone of here books to date including the holiday one! For anyone to say that she isn't a wonderful and beautiful writer is to say they are blind and stupid if they can't love the dramatic way she sucks you into the stories!! Out of my collection of books I have, I've re-read Judes at least 10 times each and will never lend them out!(not to say that I haven't bought other copies for my sisters! Just like to say keep on wowing us with the beautiful story telling!!!Love the Blessing by the by!!!"
5,Never Too Old,"Never too old to read children's books, these were my favorites and I collected several as a cherished memory. With all the electronic toys for kids these days it is refreshing to read about what kids used to do for fun. It teaches that communing with nature and animals provides a healthy interest in the bigger world they we eventually support ourselves in."
2,A little biased racially,"I thought the idea was very good, and the stories themselves were positive, but I found a bit of racial bias across the whole of the book. There's enough room for children of all cultures, colors and religions here, but I just didn't see it. In reading to my 5 year old, it was she that noticed first. Not giving this a bad review, but believe it to be racially weighted non-chalantly."
3,Good read but outdated.,"I bought this because it was inexpensive and what i thought was the new ""green monster"". It an interesting read to see how the standars and expectations have evolved but if you're looking for up to date information, keep looking."
1,Beware!,"This is a BS reprint POCKETBOOK. Not full sized. The type is illegible and the photos are indeciperable.Don't be suckered, find and buy the 8-12 X 11"" book"
3,It's O.K.,I'm in DEP so I'm looking to soak up all the information I can before boot. This book does have a great deal of information in it but most of the essential stuff like General Orders and Ranks and the motto and birthday were already in a book the recruiter gave me after joining. This book does have dress codes and grooming and disassembly of the M16 which I found very interesting. Some of the pictures though are poor quality and it's hard to make out what they are. The book is very small and top to bottom instead of left to right.
4,Dependable and Worth having,Pros:I left for the entire summer for my job and haven't been home to feed the fish although a friend is changing the water that is by no means a daily thing. I didnt even bother using the batteries it came with as I never trust the batteries I get with items as they are often dead or near dead. Just put a new set of batteries in and your ready to go. The programming is easy and required little to no work. The instructions help but if you've ever programmed a digital watch its about the same level of complexity. I highly recommend this item. Pellets/small flakes are the way to go and a mix could work as well.Cons:Mount is not very good but easily modified to fit and aquarium. It is easily reversible as well.
1,Piece of junk -- programming is ridiculously complex,"Rule number 1 in product design: don't make your customer feel like an idiot.Current broke this rule right off with this auto feeder. I read the instructions, went online and viewed the video, went to their site and read the FAQs, set the stupid ""down arrow"" (which is totally non-intuitive) and it still doesn't feed the fish. I'm about to go on vacation. I bought this way ahead of time to make sure it worked, etc. Now I have to run out and buy something else and hope it works.Why is a fish feeder more complicated to set up than an iPhone???Seems like a good quality product. Too bad it doesn't do what it's supposed to do."
1,junk,"Was defective ..... the food drum wouldn't rotate at preset times....it only rotated when manual button was used...needless to say, i was very disappointed with product"
5,Works great,"I bought this feeder in a rush right before I was going on vacation. I'd completely forgotten about how I was going to feed my fish for 11 days while I was away and I made the decision almost solely on cost and how fast it could be shipped (Amazon Prime). I went out on a limb with this selection because I was looking for a pond feeder, but not willing to pay over $100 for a typical one. While this labeled as an aquarium feeder, I wasn't sure how it would work out. Once I got the feeder in, I rigged a setup for it to be suspended over the pond, and the rest is history. It worked out perfectly. I have 7 good size Koi to feed and the feeder allowed for great flexibility (how many times a day to feed, and adjustable levels of how much to feed)."
2,Food gets moist,"The food in my previous fish feeder always got a little wet and would clump together. I chose this feeder when I bought a new one, because it specifically said it was designed to avoid this problem. That hasn't been my experience. As time goes on, it seems to get worse. I don't know if this is because the door you open to insert the food gets looser over time and lets moisture in there, or what. The food won't stay dry for more than a day anymore, and I've only had it for 6 months, or less. Disappointed."
2,AquaChef Auto Feeder,"The feeder is easy to assemble and works great. Timer and readout are clear and quick to set up. The only negative thing about this product is the design of the clamp. It didn't fit on the aquarium edge (it has to be forced on, if you want the clamp to work, but mine did not) and the foam sticky pads were not secure and could not hold the weight on to the light panel top, so it fell in the water! Too bad, otherwise a good product. I bought another timer from a retail store and that timer uses a better screw on clamp (it fits snugly and easily mounts on the edge) but it's not a digital readout and the timer is not adjustable, but it works."
3,"Works, mostly","First, the batteries that were included lasted no more than one day. Second, I cannot reduce the feeding amount as low as I would like (I have a 10 gallon tank). Third, the programming interface is poor. But, it works and I continue to use it when I'm away from home."
2,Good but not that good,I bought this product to feed my fish on vacatioon. I thought I woould test it before I left on my vacation. The set up is very complicated. As others have said do not lose the instructions. I tested it manually to see how much feeding it would deliver and every time it would deliver a different amount of food. So your fish are left out for luck. I guess you get what you pay for. But for the week I am gone I am hoping it would at least keep my fish alive.
4,No Problems,"I've had this feeder for about 2 months and it works great. Slightly complicated to program but if you can follow the directions it's no problem. The one downside is the narrow opening for the attachment to the side of the tank. Opened all the way up it barely fits. I believe the suction cup can be removed but I was able to make it work with it still attached. Also, you may have to crumble you food if you are feeding with the ""less food"" opening. But overall, this is a great product."
1,Starving fish,"I purchased this feeder so my fish would not go hungry while I was on vacation. The time and the feedings are set using a 24h clock, so it's pretty hard to mess up. I did a trial run and everything seemed to be working fine. When I got back from vacation, my fish were not looking so hot. I fed them and they ate voraciously which got me wondering if the feeder was actually working. So I set my iphone alarm for 10:00 am and watched the feeder to see if it was dispensing food. Nothing. Then I set it for 11:00 am, and watched. Still nothing. So somewhere during the time I was gone, this feeder just quit working. Batteries are fine, clock is set right and so is the feeding time.Maybe it will work for you, but it didn't work for me."
1,Broke within a few uses,"This fish feeder was more expensive than my last one, and the cheaper one is way better! This feeder stopped working after just a few tries...digital is not always better!"
3,Fish Feeder,"Worked well overall. We did have great difficulty finding the right type of fish food to work with the feeder to distribute the right amount of food at once. We explored large pellets, small pellets, then finally tried flakes which our fish weren't use to. The flakes worked best. Bottom line, is it's difficult to program the amount of food released. We either had not enough or too much. We balanced that with frequency of feeding. In the end over our 10 day vacation fish were fed and healthy upon our return."
2,USA Aquachef Auto Fish Feeder,"Works infrequently, difficult to program, unreliable attachment to the tank. Overall, VERY dissatisfied. Next time, I'll spend more $ for a better quality product."
3,Auachef Fish Feeder works good but can get battery cover off,"This feeder works well and is great for going on vacations, but I hope I don't need to change the batteries again because it was extremely difficult to get the cover off, to the point where I was sure it was going to break."
3,Fish feeder?,"This feeder is better then most but, it still is not there. Timer is great and to have different times to feed during the day is nice. Down side is that the amount of food dropped is hard to set and is not consistant. On one or two occations in the week that I have been using it the trap door did not open and the fish gave me a dirty look. I worry that if I leave them for two weeks when I go on vaction when I return they will have eaton each other. Kinda like that servivor reality show on TV. Lets hope it works."
2,auto feeder.,The clamp wouldn't open far enough to go over the top of the aquarium. Had to modify it and make my own bracket. It's hard to program the feeding time. Too many steps. It works now but the clamp opening needs to be enlarged.
3,Pudo ser mejor,"Este producto empezo bien ,despues el sistema dejo de funcionar correctamente,descargaba las pilas rapido. en mi opinion es bueno solo para los fines de semana ."
3,Works but has some drawbacks,"I bought one of these so that we could go away on a long weekend and not kill my daughter's goldfish ($1 carnival prize goldfish--$25 feeder). It took me three tries to figure out the programming instructions--I agree with the others that encountered problems. I am fairly computer literate and the steps required to program the thing were ridiculous. I basically got it to work by accident. It is also not attached to the ""adjustable"" mounting bracket--it simply slides off. I found this out after carrying it across the room by the mounting bracket--it fell off and smashed into about a dozen pieces on my tile floor. So . . . it seemed to be reliable for the few days that we used it and it is relatively quiet, but if you lack technical ability or interpret ""adjustable"" as ""attached, but movable"" this may not be the feeder for you."
2,It's... ok,"It was... ok. The food would get wet and clump. Maybe it would work well with pellets but with flakes it wasn't the best. It works and it's cheap if you need something, but I wouldn't buy this again."
1,Very poor fish feeder,This product is the poorest quality of the many products I have purchased thru Amazon. The dispenser is NOT adjustable and often doesn't work. I would strongly recommend not purchasing this fish feeder.
2,It is automatic,"I suggest it for flake usage only. I feed Spectrum new life mini pellets. It was 6 pellets or 125, no inbetween/ The full rotation feature is very nice, it does keep your food very dry!"
2,Buyer Beware,"Readers should know that the basic premise of this book -- that William T. Phillips was Butch Cassidy -- has been thoroughly discredited by historians and forensic scientists. The book should be viewed as a novel, not as history."
4,Ah memories ...,"Not perfect by any means but superbly 'real'.I loved the 'feel' of this recording, but it did make me wish there was a Original cast recording of the London staging in 1968 with Judi Dench as Sally Bowles: she was even better than Liza minelli in the part and that's saying something as I consider Liza's Sally to be one of the best performances on screen ever!"
2,Would have been better if......,"....It had actually been a gel. It was actually a liquid. It went right through my Matala pads. I put a plastic bag under the pads to catch the liquid, but it made a mess anyway, and dripped off as I was taking to the waterfall weir. Certainly not what I expected, and will not purchase it again. I do not understand why they call it a gel when it is most certainly not."
4,An excellent survey of the subject,"From the Publishers' Note -""This booklet comprises a brief history of a tightly-bunched group of tramways in West Yorkshire.

5,I've Always Loved Charlie Rich,"I have loved Charlie Rich since I was a kid (12 years old). I remember ""Lonely Weekends"" being played on the radio. But, it was when my grandmother bought ""Who Will The Next Fool Be?"" that I really started to pay attention. I know Bobby Bland also recorded this song, but it was Charlie Rich's version that I always remembered. ""Feels Like Going Home"" shows the versatility of Charlie Rich. I love ""Field of Yellow Daisies"" and ""Have a Heart"" Overall, I am very pleased that I finally decided to buy some Charlie Rich for myself. Even my kids like this CD. My son was amazed when he heard ""Lonely Weekends"". By the way, I still have my grandmother's 45 of ""Who Will The Next Fool Be?"" I think Charlie has been underrated all his life. That man could sing anything and he could play that piano."
5,Perhaps it deserves SIX stars!!,"This is one of the best compilations I have everpurchased. I have listened to it over and over but,to my surprise, my 18-year old grandson got prettyexcited over it and asked me to pick it up for himif I could find it and he would pay me. I hadplayed ""Mohair Sam"" for him, then ""Big Boss Man"".This album shows how Charlie Rich started out, withmostly rock-a-billy as did many other countryartists, and shows how very versatile he was andwhat a consummate musician. I really never realizedwhat a great musician he was until I bought thisset. I thought he sang mostly countryballads."
4,"Nothing to do with Feng Shui, but great for Tai Chi","I bought this CD to use in my Tai Chi classes, and it has served me well. The music is nonobtrusive, but not boring. It is calming, and the pace is steady and slow, perfect for Tai Chi."
4,"great dialogue, decent animation, okay boarding, okay story","The title says it all, but I just want to say that I enjoy the stylistic choices peter chung makes and his rendition of the live action characters are very nice.Some great quotes from the character Riddick appear in this and I'd just like to share some that were of particular delight to me:""I cannot see!""""You don't . . want to.""-Ihman and Riddick""I want to see your masterpiece.""""I get out, you'll see it again . . . this close""-Mistress and Riddick""Call off your lapdog, before his trying to impress you gets him killed.""-Riddick""I shall pray.""""Not for me.""-Ihman and Riddick"
4,Hold your breath,"This short animated feature was created to help fill in the gap between Riddick movies and at the same time, cash in on the hype of the new movie in 2004. Being a huge fan of Pitch Black I wasted no time buying this DVD then. Riddick, Imon and Jack are present and all voiced by their real actors. Also present is Toombs who plays a bigger role in the 3rd installment. Even though the movie is short, I consider it essential if you liked Pitch Black and The Chronicles of Riddick."
3,"Riddick it's not, but it does fill the gaps","It's ashame that this was done in animation, it could have been a really super movie. It helps fill in some of the gaps between the other two riddick movies. I suggest getting the directors cuts of both to get other story enhancing information. The best part of the movie is that Vin does the the voice of riddick. Only for the hard core riddick fan."
3,If you like the Animatrix...,"This is directed by Peter Chung, who directed Matriculated in the Animatrix, and the animation does show a large ammount of similarity, but thankfully it's 35 instead of 10 minutes long, so we have more time to enjoy it. This movie does help bridge the gap a little from the dark and dirty world of Pitch Black and brings us into the glamorous realm of The Chronicles of Riddick. The original actors all play their characters, and a villain from the 2nd film is introduced in this and the whole deal is explained a little better, but I wish it was longer. That would have made it so much better, but with the hard work going on Chronicles, a 35 minute anime-esque short doesn't bother me in the least."
4,"Excellent, fluid animation! Great music and well written.","If you like great animation, Peter Chung or the character of Riddick, you can't go wrong with this dvd. Peter Chung is truly one of the top animators/character designers working today. His characters are lanky, very detailed and will always bring back fond memories of Mtv's Aeon Flux series. Give Peter a decent budget, let him work with his core team and he produces/directs amazing animation as seen in this dvd. It would be great if more of these direct-to-dvd mini-movies would come out. In some cases, they are actually more entertaining than the films they are based on. This is NOT RATED, but contains a good share of graphic violence and a little profanity (which I think is a good thing). This is better than his Animatrix short by a longshot. Buy this and the Van Helsing anime and let Universal Video know that you support American produced adult animation!"
3,Short but good,"This was done in the AniMatrix style. It was a little short, but done well in my opinion."
3,Good but too short,"As a bridge to Pitch Black and Chronicles of Riddick, Dark Fury serves its purpose, as it will shed light on Chronicles' vague references on the past.Peter Chung and team's animation doesn't disappoint. It's fluid, and full of action. However, as a consumer, I rather balk at paying full price for such a short content. The main feature itself is just around 35 minutes. While the Extras are mostly about the animation process. It would've been a better value if the creators of Riddick's world included some background info on different planets of the series' universe, some character bios, and other stuff that would flesh out the Riddick mythos. Sure, it may be asking too much but that's because Dark Fury DVD is too little.You'd be better off moneywise renting, buying used or waiting for it to be packaged in a bundle pack/gift set rather than buying it stand alone and brand new."
4,"Nice bridging, cool anime","I was a big fan of the bizarro Aeon Flux back in the 90's and director Peter Chung brings that wonderful style to the universe of Riddick (much like he did in The Animatrix).Dark Fury is a small story set between Pitch Black and The Chronicles of Riddick (which I haven't seen) in which Riddick, Jack and Abu dock their scout vessel with an ominous and evil ship filled with frozen Mercs and run by a vicious female overlord with a perverted idea of imprisonment.The whole thing is basically an excuse for some quick violence but it's entertaining and expands upon the Riddick universe in interesting ways. I can see why Vin Diesel chose this franchise over TFATF and xXx.The DVD is in non-anamorphic (!) 1.85:1 widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound and a bunch of whogivesadamn extras."
2,Not very good,"While I like animation, I have to say the animation was horrible. Vin Diesel as Riddick is very sleek, fluid, and attractive. The animated Riddick was not. The story only asks more questions, so no answers here, and while this short is supposed to be a bridge between the movies Pitch Black and The Chronicles of Riddick, it isn't. In fact, it only serves to make The Chronicles of Riddick make less sense. Still, it is interesting and there are some great one liners, so I definately recommend all Riddick fans to at least rent it."
4,Riddick v1.5. 51 out of 100,"This animated version of the Chronicles of Riddick was a nice go between movie, but really wasn't necessary to fill in the gaps between Pitch Black and The Chronicles of Riddick. I enjoyed the animation, even though I am not an amination fan per se, but probably wouldn't watch it again.If you must buy this, consider the 3 movie pack for under $20 available on Amazon. It is a great deal and packs all 3 movies and all the commentaries.Total Score (out of 100) = 5134 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.2 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?6 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?5 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?3 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting?1 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase?"
2,Too Short,"I adore Vin Diesel, but this anime was all style and no substance. The character design of Riddick made him look like a frog. The villian sounded like Zsa Zsa Gabor, and was straight out of 101 Dalmations or a Saturday morning cartoon.Riddick just violently offs a bunch of mercs while trying to get Jack, himself, and the Imam off a huge spaceship that has captured their small craft.He fights a couple of the creatures from Pitch Black; that is the only cool part."
5,Top notch Sam Durell adventure set in Burma,"Written in 1961 and therefore dated, this Durell CIA adventure is well written, a terrific plot, lots of local flavor and customs and some interesting characters. A missing OSS officer is tracked down by his sister and she talks her husband into searching for him in the jungles of Burma. Durell is called in to locate the now missing husband and the OSS officer, who is rumored to be alive and working for the Reds (remember them?). Twists and turns, torture, assassins in the shadows, traitors in high places, danger and murder fill the pages of this one as Durell races to stop Chinese intervention into the region. This takes place years before the US involvement in SE Asia so it fills the post French time period nicely. I give it five .38 Specials."
4,"mystery, romance and humor","Someone conked our heroine on the head as she was going about her business, giving cosmetic treatments at women's homes. When she regains consciousness, she swears she remembers seeing a goat just before she was hit. A goat, in the heart of London? Everyone thinks her head hasn't quite healed. But she embarks on a search for the goat, and in the process turns her whole life upside down. There are serious losses along the way, but treated with enough humor that they don't feel so serious. And, of course, she finds the goat, and the story behind it. It's not the very best of Elizabeth Cadell, but it's a marvelous read."
5,Yea!,"My 4 year old recieved his first piece of Geo Trax last year for his birthday and he LOVES it! Now that we built a toy room in the basement we set it up again on his foam floor, we got him the fire truck addition and he was SO excited, every day we leave for daycare he has to say good bye to his fire truck! He has dropped it a few times, the puppy has chewed on it and carried it away and it still works as great as the first day we got it!"
4,Great toy. Questionable quality.,"My three-year-old son loves this toy. However, the sound effects have been malfunctioning periodically ever since I purchased it. Numerous battery changes and position changes make no difference. It is quite finicky. We have many pieces to this set and this is the only one with that problem. I think it is just a lemon. Even without the sound effects it is a great addition to our system."
2,"FIne book, Easy read--","This book is ok. It's nothing really new that most people with some common sense don't already know....If you can get it in a library or borrow it, go that route. Not worth it."
2,Yawn,"The most useful part of this book was the chapter on Equal Opportunity/Fair Housing. I appreciated knowing exactly what I should do if and when bigotry is expressed. What was eye opening is that if the agent does not take positive steps to report and curtail the unlawful (or even just plain unsavory) behavior of others in the real estate market, one could be held liable; you can't simply choose to be no part of it without risking liability. Other than that, everything was ho-hum and a real yawner. If you read other books, you get the same advice, only in greater detail and with more revealing explanations."
3,"Not bad, but pretty basic","Maybe I have a better broker than most, but I didn't find much in here that I didn't already know. That said, its not a bad book and could be of use to you if your broker is lacking, if you are just getting started, or if you are looking for a little refresher.GTR"
2,nothing special,"this was the 6th real estate book i have read, gearing up for my new license. This book provided no special insight. The author actually wrote about the importance of having a cell phone and Internet. Talk about a waste of paper! Most of the book seems to be filler material the publisher asked the author to add. There are a lot of stories and little actual content. I would buy it used if at all."
1,Dont Bother,"To anyone who is serious about work and self-employment in general, this book has little insights to share. Bottom line message is, if you are willing to put 100% effort and dedication into being a real estate sales agent, you will have a carreer and make money. Well, ain't that the truth to any endeavour? Don't bother to buy the book. It is apparent that noone will make it in anything if you don't put work into it."
1,Comfort Fit Collar,"When I made the purchase I thought I purchased a PetSafe comfort fit collar receiver, not the PetSafe comfort fit bark control collar. I made the manager aware of the mistake and offered to pay any price difference in order to get the mistake rectified. The manager, in an email, told me the mistake would be rectified free of charge but I have not see the PetSafe comfort fit receiver."
1,not good at all,"my dog is deaf and has a terrible high pitched bark. she ran through her first bark collar in about 8 months. i got this one as the replacement and it stopped working after about six weeks. when i bought replacement batteries, neither seemed to work so i took them back and exchanged them, thinking they were bad. still didn't work. now it's 3 in the morning and she's barking and whining and i can't sleep. i DO NOT recommend this product."
3,"mixed results, not durable","This collar worked well for our incessantly barking dog, though she quickly figured out that barking was a-ok when the collar was not on. So it had to be on whenever she went outside where there are squirrels, leaves and air to bark at. I accidentally shocked myself with it once when I was holding it and the dog barked (smart dog!) and its not painful, but it is unpleasant. However this expensive item is not at all durable. We've gone through two and finally used common sense and serched the internet for quality, durable bark collars, which this is not."
4,Definitely works,This collar really does work. My dog did still bark a little in the beginning and it did leave some small burns on her neck. As long as she doesn't bark it doesn't hurt her.
1,My dog suffered from this product,"I have a crazy beagle that barks non-stop so we got this product and it worked wonders! But after using it for awhile, my dog had a seizure. We have no known reason why this occurred but when talking to the vet they suggested that the shocks from the collar were most likely the cause. We are now looking into the citronella bark collars. Please look into that as well for your dog before trying the shock collar. I would hate for your dog to be one that has seizures as well."
1,Shipping rip-off,"This product, which is good, is artificially priced low, and the shipping will kill you. Buyer beware!"
3,Not for small dogs,"I bought this collar to control three of my 15 lb. dogs, a dachsund and 2 bichons. The collar is huge. After cutting off about 14 inches of excess collar the fit is oblong and appears very cumbersome. The first battery lasted over a month. I admit the collar does work well at controlling the barking. I've been switching it between dogs and each dog has it figured out and knows when they are not wearing it. I'm back looking for a smaller and better fitting collar as I will not buy another of this model. I recommend it to larger breeds, even though it says 11 lbs and up, hesitate to buy it for a dog under 20#."
5,It works!,"We tried everything from a muzzle to a spray collar. The barking problem still existed and my neighbors were getting frustrated. Once I bought this collar the barking stopped. I was worried that the shock would hurt my smaller 20lb. dog, but it doesn't. I would highly recommend this product."
1,defective buyer beware,"This unit definatly does not work the way it should. It hit my boxer with a shock just from her running around the yard and breathing heavily. Later on it hit her again from the door bell ringing (she was sitting down like everything was normal). I contacted support from the manufacturer and they were worse than useless, they made it seem like I was committing an animal cruilty crime. They ended up telling me that the user manual was wrong. They told me to make the collar tighter. If I left it like that, only one hole smaller, it would be uncomfortable/breathing problems. One day, and it went in the trash."
1,Don't buy the collar,"The collar dies when the battery is replaced. The collar stopped our labrador from barking WHEN the collar worked. When the battery died, we replaced it but the collar wouldn't ""restart"". We called the manufacturer to replace the collar (1 year warranty) they knew about the problem and sent a new collar. Same the happened with the replacement collar. Again we sent it back to the manufacturer for a second replacement collar. Same thing happened to the third collar. I am now looking at collars made by Tri Tronics and Innotek."
4,requires a tiny phillips screwdriver!,"this product gets a whopping four stars because it works. turn it on, put it on the pooch, and the pooch's reign of terror is over. my dog had a habit of barking incessantly when left home alone, and this is the only option i tried that worked.don't feel bad, it's really not so cruel. he learned after the second buzz that it was related to the barking. it's been quiet here since then.the only silly thing is that you need a tiny screwdriver to turn this collar on and off. i suppose you could leave it on all the time- i had a petsafe one that didn't turn off and the batteries lasted four or five months."
4,Had This One for About 3 Years -- Works Great!,I bought one of these fans about three years ago to replace the one I use every night to both circulate air and provide a white noise backdrop.It's metal construction with a base stand and three speed controls. The lowest level is fairly quiet and so I usually have to run it at the next higher speed if I want thorough noise blockage.I don't know what else there is to say. It's sturdy. Looks pretty much like it did when new (except for the dust that accumulates on the blades). It's used every night and shows no sign that it's going to stop functioning. Nice powerful blast of wind at the high setting.Pam Tmom and reviewer-at-large
5,"Great read, makes you think about your relationship!",I ended up giving the first book to my best friend while I was back home for a weekend. I really connected with the way the authors linked the childhood and the present. It was an all around good read and good advice.
2,A poor piece of work.,"This book has several major flaws. I will mention 2 in this review. 1) This is a very superficial books. There are very few pages dedicated to explaining the principles of neuroplasticity. If your knowledge to the field is limited, don't expect to learn much here. 2) This book was probably long outdated already when it was published in 2002. The research referred to is mainly old, with many references going back to 1980's and 1970', even 1950's!It is hard to say what kind of readers this book was inteded for. It is not an introductionary text for students, but its neither something that could offer researchers and scholars anything of interest, with most chapters being only 15-20 pages long. A search here on Amazon shows that there are not many books avaiable about neuroplasticity. It therefore makes it even more frustrating that when occasionally something is published, it should be of such low quality."
3,the delopment of computers in NASA,Kind of dry and tech oriented. Good history of computers in NASA use. How they were delveloped and used in missions.
3,Good detail but poor graphics and no reference links,I have a kindle fire and the graphics in this book when enlarged are not readable. This book has many biographical notes. Howevever these are not linked! I would have paid more for the book if table of contents and references were link to the other material in the book. The chapter headings seem to me repeated too often for an e-book.The content has great detail! I highlight interesting portions so I can establish a link to that part of the book.
3,"Interesting read, terrible formatting",I found this information in this quite interesting but it suffers badly from poor formatting. There are numbers that appear scattered all through the text - look like footnote references but I'm not sure; they aren't linked to anything and don't match the few footnotes at the end of the chapters. The occasional diagrams are unreadable and would have helped greatly in understanding the material had they been readable.The information is good but the book suffers from the poor presentation. I was disappointed.
2,Disappointing in the Extreme,"A more accurate title for this book would be ""Military Errors Made by Hitler Personally"". Instead of listing mistakes and their ramifications Mr. Alexander practically writes the history of the war and when a mistake is made says ""He shouldn't have done this."" For example, he takes 32 pages to lead up to stating that the German armies should not have been stopped outside Dunkirk.Equally frustrating Mr. Alexander only deals with military strategy. He ignores political mistakes such as declaring war on the USA. Nor does he address manufacturing or logistics, such as making Speer Armaments chief in 1936 rather than 1942 or manufacturing fighter drop tanks for the Battle of Britain.All in all this is certainly not what I had expected."
2,luckinoz,"well the ages old saying that there is nothing new under the sun very well applies to this basic overview of the second world war.The authors basic and obvious conclusion on how Hitler could have won the war is based on the oft repeated view of Not attacking the USSR, focusing on defeating Britain thru indirect action in North Africa and the complete control of the Mediterranean theater.As a whole this book does not live up to its title BUT it is not a complete loss and may appeal to the novice WW2 enthusiast. The information within is correct without to much detail, there are no new insights or no new uncovered information, just basic basic basic."
2,Completely Misleading Title,"Given the title of this book, I was expecting a bit more analysis as to how Hitler could have won World War II. The author disappointed. This book is no more than a decent short survey of the war. In fact, it often read more like a college-level history paper than a carefully researched body of work. For example, the author describes Montgomery as ""...an eccentric man concerned with his own glory..."", but then fails to support his point. It's a rare occasion when I feel I've wasted my time reading a book--this was a rare book in that regard. I've read many a detailed account of the Second World War and I wasn't in the market for the broad survey that Mr Alexander's book offered. If you're looking for an analysis of courses of action Hitler might have taken to win the war--as I was--leave this book on the shelf."
2,Not for the serious student of WW II,"Bevin Alexander has written in the past the excellent book ""How Great Generals Win"", but this new one is so much disappointing that I couldn't believe it came from the same author. Nothing new is contained, and the title is misleading because Bevin Alexander does not point out the fatal errors of the Nazi Germany but only recounts the trivial history of World War II without offering any new perspective. If you want to read something interesting about World War II, avoid this book and try instead Richard Overy's ""How the Allies Won"" or John Ellis' ""Brute Force"", or the much discussed and controversial study of Martin van Creveld ""Fighting Power""."
4,A solid account.,"Alexander has produced a solid military history of World War II from the perspective of Hitler's strategic mistakes that led to German defeat. This book is a refreshingly objective look at the war, providing some interesting character and detail to not only the Allied commanders but the German commanders as well. Alexander's basic thesis is that Hitler missed his best chance to win an overwhelming victory when, in 1941, he elected to go forward with the invasion of Russia rather than taking Cairo and the Suez Cannal and opening the door to capturing the oil-rich middle east. All in all, this an excellent history for the casual or novice World War II historian who is interested in learning more. Probably not a good pick for someone with a more informed interest."
4,More tactics than strategy,"I expected an overview of strategic mistakes make by Hitler that, if not made, would have turned the tide of the war toward Germany. That information is in here, but you do have to wade through chapters dealing mostly with tactical manuevers by various units on both sides. I would have preferred a much shorter book with JUST the strategic overview, as I can get better information on each specific battle elsewhere. Nonetheless, this is a good overview of WWII for history buffs."
2,Couldn't wait to put it down....,"...in other words, I couldn't wait to get through with this book! It was a gift so I felt obligated to read it. I am seriously interested in World War Two but this book does not rank in my favorites or anywhere near it. Hitler's mistakes and errors could have been explained in much simpler terms but the author chose to pile on uninteresting and unnessesary tidbits of WWII lore that had no bearing on the facts. After spending an entire chapter on the Invasion of Sicily and why Hitler lost it, he threw in a page and-half-about the slapping incidents that got George Patton in trouble with Ike. What did thay have to do with Hitler's error in judgement and lack of military skill? If you have nothing else to do, and are interested in World War Two, read this book. But if you want to read a serious, scholarly book about Hitler's shortcomings, this isn't it!"
2,Title Misleads,"This is a well written book by a noted historian. (...); a more apt title would have been ""Hitler's Errors in WW2"" . About 50% of the book is stock retelling of the war; not much new here. The rest is Hitler's mistakes, without much commentary on, ummm, HOW he could have won World War 2. Skip it."
5,This box set is THE essential Willie Nelson collection,"As a die hard Willie Nelson fan, I own about 20 of this great artist's albums. Revolutions of Time is an excellent--dare I say the best--compilation of Willie's remarkable songwriting and performing achievements that span over four decades. Attempting to summarize Willie's remarkable career is a difficult, albeit impossible, task. Revolutions of Time does by far the best job of achieving this goal that I have ever seen."
5,"The Voice of America, really","This is a fabulous collection of Willie, perhaps the best ever. He sometimes speaks in the voice of God..wise, funny and sad...Great buy"
3,Pretty Tame,"Telarc seems to be making a concerted effort to establish itself as a blues label; however, recordings such as this one will do little to advance the label's cause. This is pretty tame stuff (I was tempted to write ""lame,"" but will consign that harsher term to parentheses), with Primer not showing much to distinguish himself either vocally or instrumentally. There are the usual plodding blues drums, harmonica fills, etc. Just another tired-sounding blues album. Sorry--no matter how nice a job Telarc does technically in recording this stuff, it still sounds, well, tame."
1,Movie Tie-in,"There is a reason no one really reads movie tie in books-and this book is a classic example of why. I ever saw the movie Lady Jane of which the book based but I knew about Jane as the Nine Day queen and thought this book would be a novel of that. Instead it appears to be a word for word retelling of the movie which no visual element at all. I mean, Jane and her husband became lovers in one spot, but the only clue I had to that happening was that the next morning they were talking about how they didn't hate each other. There wasn't even a break in the paragraph from talking at night to talking in the morning! Where was the sex? Also Guilford (the husband) goes from being an ass to a wonderful person in about five minutes!I can't recommend this-its lacking too much.One star"
5,Boricua? I think so!,"I PERSONALLY LOVED BIG BOY FROM THE GET IV'E LISTENED TO HIS MUSIC SINCE 1993 AND HE GETS BETTER AND BETTER. HIS TRACKS OFF ""BIG IMPACT"" ARE PHAT YOU CAN DANCE AT THE CLUBS WITH THEM AT PARTIES OR JUST KICK BACK AND ENJOY. THE BEATS AND BASS ARE OF THE HOOK AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR HIM TO COME OUT WITH SOMETHING NEW!"
5,impressive,i like this cd but I can't find it anywhere. It is very fast and i am convinced to buy it just by listening to the samples. The are also very good breakbeats for bboys
3,Playmate an OK learner guitar,"Got this almost a year ago for my 9-yr old son, and glad to say he's stayed in it. So his EVO Jr. has been holding up OK, IMO it is a decent guitar for the money. Just be aware, it may need a few minor tweeks/adjustments. My biggest gripe: the neck bends very slightly when pressing down on a string, to the point where other strings' tunes are very slightly affected by the pressure on the neck. I figured at first, this was probably inevitable due to making the neck slim enough for a child's hand to fit around, but then, his Jr.-size Yamaha Acoustic does not suffer the same problem, so...."
2,I'll say it....you get what you pay for,"Although other reviewers have given it a solid 4.0 stars, I consider this guitar a waste of money. Sure it's $99 (at the time of this review), but you will ultimately beg to have a more quality set up.My gripes:1. After playing for awhile the 1/4 locknut washer for the output fell off. I re-attached, but now the darn thing doesn't produce any more sound through the amp.2. One needs to constantly tune the strings. If you just love spending a lot of time trying to tune rather than play, get this guitar.I read someone else's review and mentioned the same locknut washer problem, yet they still gave this guitar a 4 star review. I beg to differ. Some people have lowered expectations I suppose.I'm opting for the Epiphone LP Special II Les Paul Collection Electric Guitar. It's $69 more, but I'd rather spend that difference now with quality pick-ups, headstock, and bridge.....rather than having to stare at a $99 mess now."
1,Don't bother,Bought this for my son. Rust on the strings. Frets sticking out not filed down. Pickups not aligned and lopsided. Rattled( not buzzing)when playing the Low e. This is unacceptable.
4,good gypsy wig,This wig is nice and full. Looks best with hat or scarf because part in the center looks a bit fake.

1,Thinkers Article on Lewin,"Unfortunately, one must buy this article sight unseen, and equally unfortunately, the article consists of a 1800 word summary of Lewin's life, something that is easily obtained from other sources for free. I was disappointed that there was no detail on change management or group dynamics other than to list Lewin's accomplishments."
2,its all good BUT,"I have to say, sad for Marty no doubt, but even after hearing this album I still like his earlier (earliest?) works, 'gunfighter ballads', and 'more gunfighter ballads' a lot more. I'm shocked to see ""Ballad of the Alamo"" not on this collection. I suspect that i'm complaining about Mr Robbins not sticking to the one style that i loved but there it is. thats my 5c worth."
4,Poppy the Greyhound,"I have two Greyhounds and it is hard to find anything concerning them. Was very excited to see this on the website. Everything arrived well. The only disappointment that I had was that the Greyhounds did not have the eartag on them that my other one from Target has. This eartag tells you what it is ""Poppy the Greyhound""."
2,Cheap - you get what you pay for,"Ordered this based on the good reviews I saw. By the way, the shipping cost me as much as the cheap product. Was not happy. When I received, it's some flimsy, piece of junk unfortunately. The seller was nice enough to refund the product cost after I paid to ship it back to them, but they wouldn't refund my original shipping costs. Apparently they found the product was not defective as I thought it was - maybe just a piece of junk to start with! Would not recommend."
4,"As described, looks real.",Came exactly as described. Nothing too over the top about this product. But it is as advertised and worth the money.
4,Good Reference Book For Simple Projects,This book makes a good reference and has a lot of simple circuits. It's a good place to start but many of the circuits are too simple and need to be expanded on before they are really able to be used.
4,King Arthur For Kids,"As a child, I immensely enjoyed reading this little book. Sure, it's not exactly an in-depth one on the oft-repeated tale of ""the once and future king,"" and it doesn't even really tell us much about his life and times, but it's a nice one to pique the curiosity of young readers.A good, fun start for kids interested in King Arthur."
4,Good quality concealer,"I have really enjoyed this product. It's easy to apply, works well with my fair skin, and doesn't dry out over the course of the day. My only complaint is that there was less in the container than there seemed to be based on its size. I hit the bottom of the jar far quicker than I thought I would."
5,Excellent guide for northern perennial lovers,"This book is definitely a favorite of mine in making my garden plans. The authors use their own Ontario perennial garden to illustrate and guide the reader through the planning and seasonal chores involved in a perennial garden. Although their garden style is more formal than mine, they cover choosing, planting and care of perennials in a way that is easily applied in my more casual cottage gardens. Each month has detailed cultivation and care information for many varieties that will bloom at that time, helping with the daunting task of planning so that a garden has continued bloom throughout the growing season. Attention to garden ""bones,"" the structure that holds the garden, is demonstrated in their snow-covered garden photos. Even barren of life and buried in snow, their gardens are interesting to look at, giving us hope that we too can have lovely gardens year round."
3,Easy reading,"This book is a very easy read. The only drawbacks to it are all the spelling and grammar mistakes. But other than that, it's a good introduction book."
5,This is NOW!,"Spellbinding account of something that takes place in the future but that is happening now! Originally written in 1993, author has an uncanny ability to predict the future. The character of August Webster will shock you with his true identity. Don't start at the end!!! And if you believe in past lives....maybe you shouldn't read this book....Gary Dahlhofer, Lighthouse Point, Florida"
2,End of Series,"I hate to give Gantz so few stars; the first 9 discs were terrific. I personally didn't like the last disc because so many parts were either left unexplained or remained ambiguous. When the ""kid"" finds the guns in the locker and says: ""huh...really...Hey he said we could use these."" I assume ""he"" is Gantz, but does that mean they have a physchic connection or something?If they plan to release a 3rd Season, then the ending is ok. But if that is how the series ends, then that was just lame.I got the disc hoping to finally understand everthing in the previous discs that were left unexplained, but boy was I disapointed."
1,Avoid Samsung DLPs - Trust me on this one,"As a long time audio/video-phile I have seen a lot of brands. So far Samsung appears to be about the worst when it comes to quality and supporting their products.Do a google search for Samsung ""light tunnel"" problems to learn more. Samsung has been shipping defective DLP sets with light tunnel problems for years. It is well known and well documented.If your set fails even ONE DAY after the warranty period they will ignore your complaint. I am currently involved in a pending class action law suit against Samsung over this issue.Samsung knew about the problems and continued to ship set with the same problem. They also sent out replacement parts (refurbs) that HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. That means they simply delay the problem until the warranty expires and then say ""It's no longer under warranty."".Do yourself a favor, look at other brands. The Samsung does have a nice picture, but you will regret it."
2,.pricey,Very expensive for a Lego. Not worth it but my 11 yr old has no concept of $ and bought it himself
3,Nothing Like the Summer,"Wire is underrated at best. There's some gems here. But i'll always have a special place in my heart for 1987's ""Ten Women"" - which bounced around my car stereo for two solid months in May and June of my final year in high school. Truly a good record with outstanding sound and top tunes like ""Breakwater Days (Jackie and the swim team and all the associated sexual needs""), ""Diving"", and ""She Comes On"". Great summertime music for always."
4,Strong Best of - Collection,"I saw Wire Train supporting THE ALARM in 1985 in Cologne, Germany. Although The Alarm were a brilliant live act in these times, WIRE TRAIN burnt down stage and audience within a 30 minutes mindblowing appearance. Their first three albums kept circling on my and my friends' recordplayers for the rest of our schooldays and they are still in my heart and soul. In Germany there is no chance to get any CD of this very nice recordings. The songs of this compilation are perfectly decided. Still 4**** after all this time!! I wish it would be less expensive....."
5,The Best,Wire Train will always have a place in my life....I actually played in a band that opened for them in the mid eighties. Now I am the host of a morning radio show in San Francisco(check me out @ Z957.com ...under the name of THE WOODY SHOW.) Where is Kevin Hunter?Send me an E-Mail
2,Corny,This is a really corny series i have not seen this one but by the other editions it isn't worth the 60+ dollars it will cost. The other editions were horrible and very provocative its story plot is as bad as its acting. If you want a video entirely about sexual situations this is the one for you though
1,Did not get it! Please ignore the stars,I was not too happy with this seller because they sent me an email that my order was cancelled without any explanation. When I called their store the associate stated that they do not sell this on amazon but only through their own website. If you go to their website this dollhouse is not available! I am surprised that they still have it listed on amazon and have not removed/updated it after my conversation a week or so ago.
2,Streaks,"Cleans about as good as a generic window cleaner. Leaves behind streaks no matter if you use a micro-fiber cloth, paper towels, or a crumpled up newspaper. Windex and Invisible Glass foam are better."
2,A good idea falls short,"I like the size and the version of this Bible, but the cover is cheap and brittle. The flap with a snap will broke off within two moths of pocket use. I wish that, for the $35.00, Zondervan could have made a better cover for a Bible that, in my mind, is meant for pocket use and all the abuse that goes with that. I wanted to like this Bible, but even Amazon's $25.00 price is very high for this low quality book."
4,"Handy, Compact NASB Bible","This is a very portable and compact NASB Bible with lettering that is actually rather easy on the eyes given the clarity and font of the print. This isn't a study Bible, so it's stripped down to just the basics with a simply introduction at the beginning of each book. The only drawback to the Bible would be the cover and cover snap. For such a nice Bible inside, one would expect a nicer design and more durable snap to cover it. If there was a design that didn't include the cover snap, I would recommend going for that over this one."
3,Like'em,I got the white ones and black. Very comfortable. After having them for 6 months they got a bit loose which was disappointing. They make noise when you walk as if you were wearing high heels. Good shoe for work and going out.
4,"History, between the lines","When I was in high school, a long time ago... This book and Bruce Catton's bookshelp to get me the A I allway's wanted. I never thought I would find this bookagain. It's the Southern side, and Catton was, of course the Northern side.My father from Alabama allway's told me the truth in history lies in-between.He was a big Catton fan, and as soon as I read this book from the school libraryI understood why my great grandfather and a few of my family members fought forthe South. At the time for most Southerners it was never about slavery, or blackand white. It was pride and there home.This book is a different tale of the history books in the school rooms.This war was one the United States worst war, since we were divided, but wemade it to stand when other countries can't.I recommend this book to any history buff out there, for another view of what happened. And remember that the thuth lies in between."
5,Classic Style,"What's not to like? It's an Allen Edmonds classic black dress shoe. Simple and elegant, with the workmanship to last for years.."
3,"Fine shoes, missing a metal eyelet","The Park Avenue looks good, and so far, it fits my feet well.The quality seems to be very good, other than one thing, there is one metal eyelet missing. I'd think AE quality control would have caught this. Since I like the shoes, I'm going to keep it, but still disappointed that it obviously have an issue which shouldn't be there to begin with."
2,Disappointed,"I searched and searched for a great pair of shoes for my husband. He has always worn Johnston & Murphy and everyone said these were better. He is on his feet constantly and needs something durable and comfortable. He wore holes in the bottoms of these shoes in two months. We didn't even bother sending them in to get fixed, they were always stiff, they scratched really easily and just weren't great. He went back to a cheaper pair of Johnston & Murphy shoes and they have held up really well and are a lot more comfortable for him. He has a narrow foot and he finds them a lot more comfortable for him than the Allen Edmond's shoes."
2,They felt like cardboard.,"I bought a pair online from Nordstrom. The shoes fit perfectly and were very handsome. However, the leather quality was not so good and I felt like I was holding a $300 hunk of cardboard. The upper started crinkling up badly when I bent it slightly to insert the shoe lace. I was afraid of what they would look like after a couple wearings. I wanted to have a pair of dress shoes but did not feel these would still look good past a couple wearings. The sides of the soles were sloppy and reminded me of the Bass Weejun pennyloafers I wore when I was in my 20's.When I took them back to my local Nordstrom store, the sales associate likened them to Birkenstocks. I think these shoes are better as office workhorses than dress shoes. If you are willing to spend 300 bucks for workhorses, these are just the thing for you.imo, for the texture and feel, definitely not worth 300 bucks. I don't think I'd pay $100 for them either.:("
1,Could be seconds at full price??,We returned the item because there was hard dryed glue that oozed up in the toe area of the insole and made them uncomfortable to wear. It gives the impression they could be seconds and the price was the same as if we bought them in the store.
5,I love this book!!! It is very well written!,"This book is sooooo good. I read it while I was in the 8th grade. Now I'm going to the 9th. I honestly could not put this book Down it so sooo good!!!!! If you like this one you should also try reading ""A Time For Dancing"" by Davida Wills Hurwim. It is a great book! Even better than this one! It is about two best friends and one dying from cancer!"
2,Too complicated and Sad!,"As a reader of over 85 romance novels-this has got to be one of the worst written! It took me a month to read this when,usually it takes me 2,sometimes 1 day! I dreaded reading this book-I even read other books before resuming to it again! Having your best friend who is sick love the same guy as you? Having to give up your lover for a friend?! How complicated and sad! Atleast I'm lenient enough to give two stars when, in reality,this book deserves none!"
1,Save your money,"Save your money on this book. Outdated, inaccurate pictures, no real substantial information on DELTA. Some of the pictures are obviously posed amatuers. One picture has a set of ""operators"" ready to do a door entry and two of the team have their fingers on the triggers with the weapons pointed at the back of their ""teammates"". This book was poorly edited and produced. Readers would be better off reading ""The Commandos"" or for a real life account of DELTA Operators read ""Blackhawk Down""."
1,Outright dismal and boring,If you like old 1970's vintage photos and elementary-level prose and narrative then this is the book for you. I wouldn't buy this book for a first-timer that has a sudden interest in Delta Force. Very disappointing and just not worth the money. Buy C. Beckwith's and E.Haney's books on Delta Force. Both were members of the unit and can write a better word-picture than any of the photos in the Delta-Power series book.
2,Not a very good book.,This book is dull and full of misinformation. It's that simple. There are not really any good books on this Tier one elite unit and there will probably never be because these guys will never talk.
4,Cute little baby socks,"I had Trumpette socks for my daughter when she was a baby and thought these were adorable for my son. They are really cute, and the colors are vibrant and wide in variety so I usually have a pair to go with whatever he's wearing. The only drawback, as with most baby socks I've found, is that they don't stay on very well. Still, a real cute box of socks that would make a great gift!"
4,"good watch, so-so band","I have been buying Timex watches for years and have always been quite satisfied. This watch is very nice, but my hand hit a doorway when I was carrying something wide through it and the leather band tore completely off at the pin that holds it to the watch. It seems that the leather is thinner than on my older watches by Timex."
3,Not easy to see,"I need a watch with big numbers so I can tell time without my reading glasses. Another requirement is the illumination, so I can see it when I wake up at night in a strange bedroom, and when I go to the theatre or a movie. The gold hands, however, make it difficult to read, so I switched to the same type of watch, but with dark hands."
1,Watchband not recommended,"My wrist broke out in an itchy raised red rash after wearing it for only an hour. I was very disappointed that the strap was the reason. I required medical attention and several prescriptions before we realized that it was the watchband that contained something that caused an allergic reaction. I couldn't wear it again, but replaced the strap. If you purchase this product...let the buyer beware! Otherwise the watch is very nice."
5,Hard-to-Find Memories,"I love Hank Williams' songs, but I was looking for one in particular that my husband used to sing when he was a young man in a band. I found it on this album of songs. And, yes, when I played it, it brought all those old memories back in full force. My husband passed away just over 12 years ago, but this music is another way to help keep him alive for me. Thank you, Amazon, for having what I needed to find."
5,Incredible!,"These guys were mainly known for 'Everywhere that I'm Not', and while it's a good tune it doesn't compare to some of the best tunes on this compilation. 'Gravity' is definitely one of those lost classics from the 80's, while 'Everything is Falling' and 'Come with Me' are the stuff that great pop songs are made of. You can't go wrong with this disc. Buy it before it goes out of print!"
4,Essential bookshelf guide,This is an excellent explanatory piece about bird identification that ought to be on the bookshelves of anyone who spends time looking at birds in America. It delves into the discrete and often minute differences between problem species. I came away with a lot of additional information and a new awareness of my own inadequacies of observation. It has taught me what to look for in the field and when to be suspicious of my own judgments.
4,Nikon Coolpix s50c,This is a great camera. It takes excellent pictures. The only problem with it is the lens should be centered. It is too easy to put your thumb over part of the lens.
1,Dissapointed this camera bares the NIKON logo!,"I am a big fan of NIKON cameras. My D40X is the best camera I ever bought. But this one is a big disapointment. EVERY SINGLE picture that I have taken with this camera has needed to be edited before I could print them. Even in red-eye reduction and Potrait mode, every picture of a human being has RED EYE. Also, 1 in evey 4 pictures has a light spot somewhere in the photo. No matter how much I clean the lens or adjust the light in the room, I am still getting white spots on the pictures. Most of my shots are at parties or bars (low light situation) maybe thats the problem but I've tried everything and I can't get this camera to take great potraits that I can just shoot and print. I spend hours removing red eye and touching up white-spots with photoshop."
1,Junk,"Horrid little camera. Cheaply built, it falls apart. Don't try sending back to Nikon for repairs, they will insist that you ""dropped"" it. Sorry Nikon, you dropped it. One of the truly frustrating purchases in a long while. Ironically, was forced to buy it when Samy's camera ran out of Canon's. The pictures are good but who cares when the camera falls apart?"
5,Nikon quality with WiFi,"Great size and awesome pic quality for the price. The WiFi was a snap to set up and is great. You would be surprised how many places now have free WiFi. I was at a restaurant taking pictures and found they had it. Sent the pics to my girlfriend on the spot. Very nifty feature that alone is worth the price.Nice large 3"" screen is very bright and clear. Controls are easy to use and the camera is so thin and light fits easy in your pocket.You wont be sorry if you pick one up and Amazon has the best price. Best Buy and CC were sold out."
2,Can't Get a Good Low Light Picture,"I bought this camera because of the large rear LCD viewer, and because I had a Coolpix 4300 that took Great shots. I'm ready to sell this S50c now. I cannot get true color in lower light indoors, even with the low light settings. The pictures come out blurred and yellow. I lost an important evening event because all the pictures were blurry, too dark or grainy. This camera is not easy to navigate either. Really sorry I bought it. Not recommended."
4,Easy to assemble and fun!,My son received this for his 3yr birthday. It was quick to assemble and just the right size for our yard. It is easy enough to move to cut the lawn and yet strong enough for climbing and jumping. It is worth the purchase and of good quality.
4,KIds love this,"My 5 year old and 3 year old LOVE this. It is small enough they can easily manuever around on it, yet the slide is tall enough they can enjoy sliding down it. I recommend this product for this age of child."
4,*Fun*Active*Durable*Little Tikes*,"Fortunately we purchased this through Amazon. The FIRST Super Slide arrived with 2 missing pieces! After some long calls with helpful reps, missing parts were sent. Low and behold...once the missing parts arrived, we discovered more parts were damaged or missing. Finally we ordered a new Super Slide and used parts from each to make one good Double Decker Super Slide. My 3 year old loves it! Seems solid for climbing, sliding and jumping. She has discovered how cool it is to play fort underneath and is really enjoying it by herself or with friends. Overall, we are very happy with this despite the month and a half it took to get the situation resolved."
2,Clip Art & CD,"I says high res CD, but they are low res scans where the dpi was raised to 600. The book is better to scan as the images are nice, but small. I would never purchase a product from this book company again."
2,I cant believe 8 people like this thing,I had this for 3 months and the interface in the ipod cradel broke. I have to wedge paper behind my ipod to get the thing to sit just right so that i get sound. This thing is cheaply built and not worth the money. I have since purchased a similar player that blows doors off this thing...stay away unless its free
5,Big sound from little speakers!,"At $30 this was a steal! Crisp, clear sound with bass from a tiny unit like this one was not expected. Since it's out of production, I just may have to buy another incase I buy a second iPod..."
5,Great songs I loved this CD,"The CD has a lot of great pop, ballad, and rock songs. Jade Valerie is a great singer. I can't wait for her next albums. Jade Valerie's lyrics are great. I can relate to them a lot."
4,No real complaints...,"It's a beautiful watch at a reasonable price. My only gripe is that I was unaware that this was a mechanical watch, so I had to pick up a watch winder as well because the watch stops working if there's no movement for 40+ hours. This was an issue for me because I generally do not wear my watch on the weekends so I was forced to set it every Monday until I picked up the watch winder. I would recommend this watch to others."
3,"Good...but, not Great!!!","Honestly, I was expecting a book that gave the history of the famous Henry rifles over an extended period of time. This book focused mostly on the manufacturing and missteps during the Civil War. It seemed like when they had the rifles manufactured and in stock, they couldn't sell them. When they could sell them, they couldn't produce them fast enough and did not have them in stock for shipment. It was almost a comedy/trajedy of errors.I bought a Henry rifle recently and it is a beautiful piece of work. I bought it because it is proudly ""Made in the USA"" and is a quality firearm. I'm sick of buying cheap stuff from China and whenever possible I buy American made products. This book cost nearly $30 and it was worth about $15 in my opinion. Once I'd read it, I doubt that I will ever read it again. It was about 100 pages and the final 30 pages were an appendix tracing serial numbers and a few photographs. No offense intended to the author...he seems well informed."
2,Decent but also repetitive and off topic,"This book covers in a bit more detail the history and people involved with the discovery of magnetism and subsequent magnetic phenomena. Unfortunately it is also somewhat repetitive with topics being brought up again and again for pages at a time. It also veers off topic into cosmology, metaphysics and science policy. An editor with a strong hand would have improved this book considerably. I suggest skipping this book unless you can pick it up used for half price."
5,This is a classic that must be bought!!!!,"What can I say other than wow. This is the kind of music you say ""yeah!"" to when you hear it. You remember the place you were, the smells, the people, everything...when you heard the songs the first time. She makes you belt out each word even if you can't sing just 'cause you feel so good and one with the music. Your emotions take over. Buy this. You'll see."
3,One of her best songs is missing!,"I like her Disco Song ""I've Got the Next Dance"" that she did in 1979. I have the 12' Single and I think that this song should have been in her Best of Collection."
2,"How can a ""Best of"" Collection have so many missing songs?","How can you really call this a ""best of"" CD collection form Deniece Williams, when it's missing so many crucial, amazing Niecey hits? This greatest hits compilation should have included both her 1979 disco smash ""I'VE GOT THE NEXT DANCE"" as well as her mid-80s hit ""NEVER SAY NEVER"" (produced by Culture Club's Steve Levine) - since both of those orginal LPs/CDs are OOP, they are essential additionss. Just goes to show whoever at the label who compiles these ""best of"" CDs doesn't pay attention and/is too lazy to include all the hits. Pass on this lazy, facile effort."
5,great,wonderful i have not heard this in a long time. plus it makes a great gift. wow i really don't know what to say but get it.
4,Deise Williams Hits,"Not many hits that I remember on this CD. It was worth the price to get ""It's Gonna Take a Miracle"". What a great intro for a song. I can finally throw out my 45 Receord."
4,To the dance,"`Ghostlight `is a film about Martha Graham. It is well done and brilliantly acted by Richard Move as Martha. There were so many aspects to this creative individual. One of the most touching is the reenactment of Helen Keller's visit to her studio, where she was led around to touch and be touched by the dancers. We can see the beauty and joy of dance itself.The film is 80 minutes long. There are several extras. The film of Martha performing one of her most famous dances, Lamentationis included. There is a 27 minute interview with the director and actor recalling their meetings and influences of Martha Graham. A theatrical trailer is also included.One of the few irritations, but it definitely hinders the enjoyment is the poor and at times, fuzzy sound quality. There were points when the actors were talking so softly I could not tell what they were saying and there are no captions included.Lovers of dance, the theater and Martha Graham would enjoy this performance."
4,You get your money's worth.,"This ladder rack isn't the strongest one out there, but for all intents and purposes, it works as described. Like most telescopic designs, this rack is good enough for an extension ladder or two, but you definitely don't want to load it up with building materials or anything. I would estimate that the most i've had on these bars is about 100 lbs or so, with little to no sag. The finish is pretty impressive, kind of like a hammered greyish-black look.There is a little play between the inside and outside bars, and when you first install it, it seems flimsy, but once you fasten the bars together (you will need a drill and bit for this part of the install), it tightens up pretty good.I would buy this product again if need be, its not the best, but for the price range, I really can't complain."
3,"Not so durable for the tub, but fun!","This is a really cute toy, but if you put it in the bathtub it fills up with water and is difficult (if not impossible) to drain the water out because of its hard plastic shell. I doesn't move very fast in the water, but most tub toys don't in my experience. Overall, it is a fun toy but I don't recommend it for the tub. Keep it on the floor and enjoy it."
1,Useless,"The boat won't even move in the water, goes pretty well on the hardwood floor though. George doubles as a squirt toy but good luck with that, made of pretty hard rubber and adults can barely get him to squirt. Seems to be durable, the only thing my daughter does with this toy is throw it in the tub every night (doesn't play with it), but it hits the bottom of the tub pretty hard and hasn't broken yet. Don't waste your money."
5,curious george wind-up tub time boat,"my daughter loves 3 things, spongebob, curious george and her bath. she loves this toy and it runs on linolium too."
1,Good to prop up the short leg of a table or as a hot plate,"Beside the fact that time has long passed this book by, it is utterly unreadable given the tedious writing. The term ""Cultural Creative"" is so self-congratulatory and pretentious as to be nauseating. This is strictly for San Franciscans lost in a time warp."
1,Not for creatives,"Like other reviewers I was disappointed by this book. It has none of the rigor of scientific research, nor does it really talk about creatives. Here the authors give us a tour of a form a green consuming but the gist of creativity is all but lost here. It a bit as if a robot wrote about a subject without being able to understand it from within.Therefore to me, it was not not an inspiring read. For real insights on creativity I recommend reading instead the excellentreDESIGN: reCREATE: Reinvent Yourself and Thrive in the New Economyand alsoA Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future"
3,e version?,"Hello,Sorry - this is not a review but a question. Is there a plan to make this book available in e version (Kindle; IBook?)? Please? Thank you!"
5,Thought no one was like you? Think again...,"I have had the privelage of meeting Paul Ray and Sherry Anderson, they are great people. But that doesn't begin to describe the book they wrote. 50 million people, an amount of people equal to the population of France, are emerging from our cyber-culture to be more aware of wordly problems, and more concious of personal and spiritual development. When reading this book, even if you don't agree with it all, or you don't fall into the ""Cultural Creatives"" category, you will realize the world is changing. To not be impacted by this book would be a surprise."
5,Awesome,Fantastic presentation of hope for the continuation of life on this planet. It is nice to know that the ones of us Paul Ray calls cultural creatives are not alone or few in number. Read this book to see how our world is changing and what is being done and can be done to sustain the planet and life on it.
3,Just too expensive!!!,"On more then one occasion I have had to replace the charger for this razor, and $20 is twice what this charger should cost. Norelco should make owning their razors a modest amount, this charger costs almost 25% of the complete price for the razor. I would look for a razor which has a universal charger, this is customer abuse!"
2,Charger Cord,"Received this product in a very timely manner and yes it does work, but the charger itself is the cheapest piece of junk I have ever seen for $20.00 someone is making a load of cash at the customers expense! I would not buy this particular product again!Philips Norelco Charging Cord 8000X for Speed-XL, Smart Touch, Spectra, Quarda, Precision, Arcitec, Cool Skin Shaver models and more"
4,just like original cord,it worked the way it was suppose to and it came to my house in 4 days. there was no problem
4,Shaver Cord,"My son had pulled the plug in off the end of his shaver cord, so I purchased him a new one. It works fine and replaces the old one. Shipping on it was very poor and it took over 10 days to get it to us from NY state."
4,WWE Cyber Sunday 2008 review,"The Rey Mysterio-Kane-No Holds Barred match was pretty good for a opener. The Matt Hardy-Evan Bourne-ECW title match was a high-flying,hard-hitting,entertaining showstealer. The Cryme Tyme-John Morrison/The Miz tag team match was a pretty good with alot of double-teaming to boot. The Santino Marella-Honky Tonk Man-IC title match was short but sweet. The Last Man Standing Match between The Undertaker & The Big Show was a solid,hard-hitting brawl. The HHH-Jeff Hardy-WWE title match was a back-and-forth,smash-mouth,high-flying bout and the same goes for the Batista-Chris Jericho-World's title match. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10."

5,anything to do with Johnny Rodriguez,"his music and style is great i can listen to him for hours and this cd is ok with me ,i feel anything he dose is greatcd arrived when they siaid and in perfect shape"
2,Not very much music,"I bought this as an introduction to Johnny Rodriquez. It was supposed to be ""Hits"", but I am not sure. There are only eleven very short songs on this CD. Maybe 27 minutes total of music. Very paltry for a modern day CD to have so little music. The songs are just okay. Would not recommend this CD at all."
1,Pretty useless.,"""Aristophanes' Lysistrata: The Birds, The Clouds, The Frogs (Cliffs Notes)"" - I only used these ""Cliffs Notes"" for the play ""Lysistrata."" I didn't find it extremely helpful. Symbolism, themes, and motifs weren't clearly stated. I do not recommend."
3,A little greasy,I bought a small bottle of this to see if I would like it. It really does protect against the sun but its pretty greasy. I put it on before I apply my makeup. I may try some of the other procyte sunscreens before I commit to this one.
2,Content Mainly about Zoo Administration,"OK, I was ready for exciting personal experiences and details about veterinary treatment of zoo animals. This book contains very little of that and a whole lot about zoo management, administration, etc. While I certainly acknowledge the vast amount of work necessary to operate a zoo and see that it runs smoothly with necessary provisions for all the animals; that is not what I was looking to read when I purchased this book. I was hoping to learn how they get a hippo to let you work on his teeth; or get an elephant to pick up its feet, or learn if they vaccinate all the equine animals in the zoo, if so how? Nope, this wasn't it for me."
5,"great a cappella jazz, funk, soul, and fun!","Keith Terry has been leading vocal and body percussion groups for a long time. This one is realllly hot! Funk, soul,jazz... and a whole lotta fun! As good as any urban a cappella group there is."
1,Get it elsewhere,"There's about 15 minutes crudely hacked out of the film in this DVD release, and Amazon should have said as much. My advice would be to try and get it through another medium, as it was a great movie before IFC got its hands on it."
3,"Charming, but...","I want to love this film. Really, I do. From the beginning, Alisa captivated me with her outlook on life. I followed her in her journey into womanhood, loving her every step of the way. Then, the last two minutes on the screen crushed me. The ending was anti-climatic to say the least. It was a cheap cop out at best. I'm not asking for a Hollywood happy ending, but the tragedy at the end of the film was unnecessary and cruel. Life is fleeting, I get that. The irony at the end of Mermaid does not escape me. But, they could have left the ending more ambiguous as in The World According To Garp. We know that Garp never makes it to the hospital alive, but at least we are allowed the opportunity to create our own ending if we so wish it. Mermaid denies us that opportunity. For its cruel ending, I give Mermaid only 3 stars. Had the ending been different, I would have gladly given Mermaid a higher rating."
4,very unexpected,"I was pleasantly surprised,usually I skip new Russian cinema,but this movie kept Me watching it and at the end this is probably one of My favourites."
1,the ending spoils it.,"it's a failure of imagination. also, it's not compatible with the rest of the film. it's just the easy, million-times-used ending. it has ""shock value"", and eliminates the need to tie things together, or leave a suggestive ambiguity."
2,Didn't Work,It didn't work well on our Win Xp computer. While the game was getting stuck my son lost interest in less than 15mins. He loves the show and enjoys playing online Cyberechase games at PBS Kids (works much better)... so this is a waste of money and disappointment for us.
2,Its okay. Could've been better.,"This book is okay if you already have a REAL Japanese-English Dictionary. I borrowed this one from the library just because they had nothing else and its horrible. its not very clear in grammar. Its uses romanji. Revised in '93 Its no surprise its outdated. But it just doesn't have enough words. I understand the term 'pocket' but this is supposed to be a real dictionary. I can look up little words like 'kokoro' (heart) and particles but for the most part its not a very good one -and-only dictionary. So personally, I don't like it. You may, but still I suggest the Random House Japanese-English dictionary. Not this one."
5,WHY DON'T MORE PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THIS GUY?!?!,"Honestly, I don't understand why more people don't rave about this artist. Really, this is one of the best CDs I have ever heard. I'm considering buying another copy for my car, and another for work. Musically accomplished and lyrically stunning, every last song on this album truely moves you. Pay special attention to my faves, ""Glory and Conseqence"" and ""Waiting on an Angel."""
4,Pigeonhole This......,"Those of us who know Ben Harper and The Innocent Criminals' music and have seen them live should find it no surprise that Live From Mars shows the world what we've known for awhile. This band ROCKS, this band is SOULFUL, and this band plays the hell out of the musical spectrum. Disc One showcases the band's tight, live sound with material from all the studio albums. Disc Two showcases Ben Harper in a lone live set, reinterpreting many of his songs in an acoustic set. The strength of this live albums, as opposed to typical live albums, is that the true diversity of a songwriter and a great band shines through. Few bands today can boast playing music such as reggae, soul, funk, spiritual, or folk. All the while keeping the groove moving. Luckily, however, this album will likely sell only to current fans, keeping out those that aren't worthy."
4,Good stuff,It's a spiritual experience - love these CD's - expecially the acoustic numbers. Burn One Down is not just about drug use - it's about personal freedom. Great CDs.
4,Half and Half,"""Live from Mars"" is half and half on my list of Ben Harper favorites. They are two very seperate CD's and have two extremely different tones as well as concepts. The first CD is out of control! It is extremely abrasive which I find amazing in concert but discovered, not amazing in my home. It's a great driving CD but is not nearly as wonderful as I hoped it would be. The second CD however, is a must have. It is Ben Harper acoustic and utterly raw. It is in a sense, abrasive but because of the open and festering emotions not the sound. It is a heavy and moody CD and is not something to cheer you up. It is pensive and moving. If you are a Ben Harper fan and love him live this CD set is a must have."
3,growing into it,"Disc cover was less than ' very good ' as advertised, CD in as new condition and I'm on my 3rd listen, it's getting better....."
1,"Where to begin,,,,","I guess I've become a geezer because this one leaves me completely cold. The electric set on Disc 1 is nothing remarkable and I'm sorry, but once Marvin Gaye did ""Sexual Healing"", it was done. The rest of Disc 1 is a sort of mish mash of reggae/worldmusic/pop/R&B that just doesn't hang together.Disc 2 is acoustic and is Cat Stevens with bad lyrics (""You put the happy,,,,in my ness""), and I actively disliked Cat Stevens way back when. Much angst in these whiney lyrics which overwhelms some pretty good playing by Mr. Harper and his band. The final track on the acoustic set is an outlandish ""anger song"" linking Martin Luther King with Rodney King (King-King...get it??) which is so insipid as to make this listener eject the CD.I'm told that much ganga is smoked at Ben Harper's concerts, which can be the only explanation for the rabid reception the fans at these recorded performances give to some pretty mediocre music."
5,Amazing live work,"This cd brings the Ben Harper experience alive in a way that his regular studio cds cannot. The album is almost just like a concert in how it has a whole cd of Ben playing with the Innocent Criminals, and then a whole acoustic cd, which is usually the second part of the concert before the final encore. Overall, very strong performances, although it would have been nice to see Ben merging songs together like he is known to do, but I guess that is saved for his live concerts. Highly recommended."
3,Ben Harper is AWESOME Live but this effort is weak.,"1st let me say that Ben Harper is amazing in the studio and more so live. I have seen him live twice now and he never disappoints. The problem on this album is that it lacks the energy many of the live shows have. I would place the blame more on the recording than the performance. It is a must have for all die hard Ben fans, but I would recommend the import live cd (from 96 I believe) and the live import ep that came out around ""Will To Live"". These are much more true to a Ben Harper concert. Also find any of the myriad of bootlegs from live shows, they are much more inspired. Sorry Ben, I am a huge fan, but I must speak the truth."
5,Great CD,"I am so glad I found this CD on Amazon at a great price. The CD is wonderful. I have always liked to hear Ben Harper sing, but this is the first CD I actually have of him. The live version is great!"
4,Just Amazing,"I've heard snippets of Ben Harper here and there, but this is my first full release album of him and I don't regret the purchase. Disc 1 shows Harper's rocking side and his he displays a certain soul over some of the heavy guitar playing. The remake of Marvin Gaye's ""Sexual Healing"" is funky as hell and just plain awesome. It's like Lenny Kravitz without the ""Rock Star"" type attitude Kravitz displays sometimes. Harper seems like the college buddy that you want to skip class and get high with. Disc 2 shows the acoustic side of Harper. At times he almost seems to recall the sounds of 60's folk artists. Again, a remake stands out on the disc with harper redoing the Verve's ""The Drugs Don't Work."" The final song of ""Like a King/I Rise"" is ten minutes of pure songwriting talent at its best. If you're looking for an album that rocks, swoons, sways and makes you think at the same time, pick up ""Live from Mars"". Pop it in your cd player, sit back and enjoy."
3,The Dio songs rock the rest is so-so,Spotlight kid is a terrific song and so are a handfull of other songs on this disc. But the two songs recorded with Ronnie James Dio are the only two songs worth listening to.
4,It works,I use this on my older bike. It works. It's held up under normal usage and I don't have any complaints.
5,quality and fit,Pros:solidly made and quality finish. fits well and looks great on bike. easy to install.Cons: mounting brackets too short for wife's Tek Navigator. Had to mount onto seating post.
5,Rack Review,Excellent rack. Came with all hardware required and good instructions. Was also delivered in a timely fashion.
5,Topeak bicycle racks are best.,"Topeak bicycle racks I feel are the best. They are strong and functional, with a lot of basket/luggage options. If you want to leave your basket on the rack permanently, secure to the rack with plastic ties, and then secure the basket to your biycle seat and rack with a small chain and lock. This way you have also secured your seat. It would take a thief some time to remove everything, and they want to steal things quick and easy. I use an M-Wave bicycle rack because it was cheaper/"
4,"Nice Bike Rack, must have pre-drilled holes on bike","I had to purchase the:Electra Seatpost Clamp with Rack Mount for Alloy Framebecause my bike does not have pre drilled screw holes or any way to mount the brackets to, so be aware, you must have either of those to install this.I have had the rack installed for a couple days and it works fine on my commute to and from work. I don't have the backpack clip in system so I just use a bungie cargo net. It is very sturdy and does its job. I just wish the item description was clearer before I bought it about needing the screw holes or seat collar with pre-drilled holes."
4,Solid rack - missing parts,"There is absolutely nothing wrong with the rack. It is well built and very easy to install......if you have all the right parts. I received quite a few bolts and washers with the rack, but only two nuts and you need at least six. Instead of returning it I made due with what I had in my garage and found different bolts and nuts that I could use. We may need another rack soon and honestly, I'll probably buy another one of these it is that well made. I really wanted to give it five stars but couldn't given the fact there were parts missing.Update: we loaded this rack regularly with 15 to 42 lbs and traveled over some pretty rough roads. The rack held up beautifully."
4,Would Have Been 5 Stars If Not For the Screws,The Topeak Explorer is a very good rack. I use it to secure my Sealed Lead Acid battery on my E-bike. When installing it I ran into a little problem--the screws were slightly undersized for my Schwinn Cruiser. With a little adjustment though (screw washers and nuts) I was able to secure it to the bike. I even shaken the bike side to side with the battery attached. It still stayed secure. When I mention the screws I need to clarify something. It wasn't all of the screws--just the two screws that attach the rear. The other screws attach to the Mono Stay Adapter just fine.
3,does not play well with bags from other brands,"my bags from other brands all attach far from perfectly on this one.the culprit is the way they lower the area with the top mounting screws so they get out of the way from the guides on the quick release thing.usually i have to attach my bags with velcro strap just a little farter behind and even then, have to secure the front straps with minimum amount of contact on the velcro, because they have to stretch around the front arms.this does not happen on my waldo and backburn racks. also, this one is the heaviest of the three. but just minimally.one thing i'm still unsure if it's better or worse, is the rear mounting area for accessories... it's different. for now all i know is that it's harder to adjust the tilt for the my rear lights."
4,"Great, but not universal enough","I love this rack because of the Topeak Trolley it works with, but it was a struggle to get the rack onto my Trek Navigator 2.0. My bike does have threaded holes to install a bike rack directly, but the placement of them did not work with this rack (it sat too close to my seat once installed, and I couldn't get the Trolley latched in all the way.) We found an adaptor at a bike store and it works, but the rack isn't as sturdy with the adaptor as it could be. It would be wonderful if Topeak made the rack more adaptable to the majority of bikes, or included a really nice adaptor. Otherwise, it works wonderfully and I highly recommend this with the trolley - it's so convenient."
5,Great product,I helped my cousin install one on his bike and decided to get one for my bike. Easy install and quality product.
4,Topeak Explorer Rack,"I like this rack, the track system allows an easy mounting of Topeak Trunk bags, and it seems to be sturdy. It is challenging to mount this on the bike using the included mounting straps. I had to work hard to bend the mounting straps in order for this to fit my XL bike frame, but I was able to. Once installed, the rack works well."
5,Very Good Value,"This is a well sturdy, easy to install, well designed and inexpensive rack.Its actually the base part of a storage system that could include a basket with rollers, a travel pack, saddle bags, etc... It seems to be very versatile, but gets expensive very quickly. I purchased the basket with the rollers and will give it a review after I've used it extensively.I have no buyers remorse with this product especially at this price point."
3,"Great rack, instructions are lacking","Once mounted on my 26"" Schwinn bike, it's proven to be a rugged rack. However, the half sheet instructions leave much to be desired. My instruction sheet was a poor photocopy, and appear to have been written by someone who has English as a third language: ""Height Fixation, Please find scales on the adjusting plates, there are 3 concavities for three different heights, fit carrier on your bike after chooseing (sic) 1 suitable scales, make sure this is right size and screw it up."" Your bike needs to have the extra tapped screw holes on the frame under the seat and near the rear wheel axle to attach the rack. The rack was a bit narrow for my bike frame, so I had to do a bit of stretching to open the sides of the rack to fit my bike frame."
4,nuts and bolts,This is in response to the people that had issues installing the nuts and bolts. The nuts do not simply screw on the bolts by hand. To secure the nuts to the bolts that attach to the trunk part of of the rack one will need a heavy duty pair of pliers with some serious teeth. Flat nose pliers or flat teeth wrenches will not work. In order to install the nuts and bolts that attach the silver bars to the rack one has to grip the nuts tightly with a massive pair of deep toothed pliers and then drive the bolts with a 4.5 allen wrench. If one has the proper tools then the install will be a breeze and should only take a hour of time.Side note. I installed this rack on a 18.5 inch Jamis commuter frame.
5,Very nice Quality,"This bike rake is top quality, everything fit like a glove and the workmanship is very good. Being a Mechanical Engineer myself I am always hesitant to purchase things I cannot see or touch. In Reading the other reviews I decided to take a chance, VERY glad I did. A+++ on this product and the accessories available for this rack are very good quality also."
2,"Horrible instructions, nearly impossible to install.","I was very excited to recieve this bike rack yesterday. After reading all the reviews and considering the product itself claims that it ""fits ALL"", I figured I'd have no trouble installing. Well, I was wrong. The instructions have two steps, each with one vague sentence describing what to do. I tried to install the product as vaguely described and the provided hardware is all the wrong size. I'm not even sure how to more specifically describe it, but I cannot mount this on my bike whatsoever. I'll be sending it back and getting one from a different manufacturer."
2,Need to have Seat Stays!,"I will keep this simple, this rack wont work on a bike without threaded rear seat stays. Unfortunately the info forgot to mention that. I have an old Cannondale road bike and it doesn't have the threaded rear seat stays. I didn't even know what they are, but they are two little holes on the forks coming down to the rear wheel. Quite frustrating when Amazon doesn't have these types of details. Look at the picture of the rack, see those metal arms coming out of the front, you will need holes in your bike to attach those arms. Product itself seems to be decent quality, not sure why those two arms are not black metal like the rest of it though, not to pretty."
1,crap,Came with not enough bolts! The bolts don't really work for what they are intended to do. Had to resort to using metal wire to attach it to my bike. My suggestion is to go to a bike shop for this job and have somebody fit the right rack to your bike. lesson learned.
5,high quality bike rack,"This bike rack -- and the accessories it can hold -- make riding easier and better organized. If you don't have it, where do you put your emergency repair kit? first aid kit? wallet? cell phone? It's well-made, easy to install, and fits/works well. What more could you want?"
5,Great Bike Rack,"Durable, strrong, and a graet companion with the TOPEAK bags. A must have for bringing goodies along the ride."
5,easy install,"I had this installed on my bike in 2 minutes. Very sturdy, and fits my MTX trunkbag perfectly!"
5,Perfect!,This rack fit perfectly on my 09 Kona Honky Tonk in about 15 minutes. This rack is very sturdy and looks nice too!
4,Easy install,"All the included allen head bolts actually fit my old bike. I wasn't prepared for this because it usually never works out that easily for me. I found it best to just look at the pictures on the instructions and don't try to actually read them. It probably took me about 40 minutes to install this but if I had to do another one, I think I could do it in 10 minutes. Can be installed with a set of Allen wrenches, a level and a socket set.Once installed, the rack seems to be pretty strong. I used zip ties and a couple small hose clamps to attach a plastic milk crate to the rack. My bike is now an official utility vehicle. Because it's so much less of a hassel to carry stuff, I use my bike more often now."
4,Bike Rack,"This rack was everything it said it was and more. It was very easy to install, just as the directions say. One thing, make sure your bike has the correct connection points, mine didn't but I worked around it."
4,Easy to install!,"This bike rack was incredibly easy to install and is very sturdy. I've only had it on a few days, but it seems to work very well with the Topeak MTX Trunk Bag EXP that I bought to go with it."
5,Commuter's dream!,"I bought this rack with Topeak bag to carry things when I commute to work. I wanted something that didn't look too dorky but was capable of carrying many things if I needed to goto the store after work or bring to work large items. This rack (and bag) work great! The rack has held up well in the last 1.5+ years I have used it with minor paint scratches from the bag on the top part. It is no big deal and should be expected since the top part is where the bag locks into the rack. The patented bag locking system keeps your things on bike, even during a wreck(s)! You won't go wrong with this purchase!"
5,I love the MTX track system,"I admit that I had some installation difficulties at first, but that was due to not having the right tools. I was not familiar with nylon locking bolts, which require more force to install than non-locking bolts (but they are a very good idea for applications with a lot of vibration, such as bike accessories!) The included hardware is stainless steel, according to the employee at the hardware store with whom I spoke. Once I had a good wrench, the rack took less than 20 minutes to install. My bike is a Jamis Satellite Sport Femme, and I had no problems fitting the rack to the bike.I have only been on one ride with the rack (and the MTX trunk bag that I bought to go with it), but it worked very well. The bag was very secure on the rack and I like how easily the panniers attach to the sides. It was nice to be able to just slide the bag off the rack in less than a second to take it with me inside. I had no problems carrying home 20 lbs of groceries."
1,Bad Bolts,"The rack came with 8 bolts that do not fit the nuts that came with them and do not screw into the bike. Naturally, in my efforts to force the bolts to screw in, I scratched up the ""hard"" paint. The store will not take it back in that condition. I suspect they got a bad batch of bolts and did not bother QA-ing them. I have email into their US distributor. I suspect I have a trip to Ace Hardware in my near future."
1,Universal if you own a drill and live near a hardware store...,"There were no screws for mounting the bottom connections. The two bikes I have need #4 metric screws. I had to drill out the holes on the bottom connections to accept these screws. Also you need somewhere to connect the adjustable top connections. If you are ok adapting, drilling, getting screws then go with this rack. Otherwise stay away."
1,very difficult to install,"It is very difficult to install, and there are the lack of nuts.When you open the packets, you will find there only two nuts. I don't know how to intall it with two nuts. Leave it. If you are not the professional, I suggest to go to walmart or local store to get it."
5,A must have with the ToPeak Trunk,"Installtion was a breeze on my Specialized RockHopper. Even though Topoeak has a different model specifically designed to bikes with disk brakes, I was able to install this one, no modifications on my bike. It did not interfer with the disk system.My favorite feature? The ToPeak Trunk the slides into the custom rail and locks in place. Can'e wait for an excuse to try it out!"
1,Topeak Explorer,"They ship me 8 screws and 3 washers that do not fit. I have tried to contact the manufacturer, who is not readily accessible. You have go through a set of complicated popups to write a message. Of course, they could not be bothered to respond."
3,"Disappointed, but...","Having studied the pictures closely, and visited the manufacturer's web site, I thought for sure that this unit would be the kind that has a spring trap (?), like the paperboys of yore would use to secure their newspapers.I was disappointed to find out when it arrived that this isn't the case; it's basically just a big solid frame.Will say, however, that it's well-built and fit amazingly well into existing threaded holes in my 15+ year old Bianchi Main Street.Major peeve - unlike anything purchased from Ikea or most other ""user-friendly"" vendors, this inexplicably does NOT come with the hex wrench that you'll need to assemble it, and good luck finding one in your local hardware store.But once you get it put together, maybe using a set of vise grips instead of the missing hex wrench, it fits the bill, as long as you pick up some short bungee cords to secure your cargo."
3,Slow shipping!,"I also ordered the Topeak Explorer bikerack in August, 2006 and three months later, I'm still waiting for it!"
5,Great rack but check your bike first,"I love this rack. Sturdy as all heck once installed properly. Unfortunately I didn't realize the rack was made for bikes with seat stays which my Trek didn't have. After a couple of trips to the local outdoor store, I finally stopped by a proper bike shop and picked up a Blackburn Monostay Rack Adapter. It took me nearly an hour to get everything properly installed but once installed the rack didn't move. I use this rack with a Topeak DX bag (with panniers). The bag has QuickTrack and is super-sturdy on this rack. Highly recommended."
4,Topeak Explorer Bike Rack,"I recently purchased an entry-level Schwinn bike to ride to work and to run errands in the face of $4 a gallon gas. I bought this rack because I liked the idea of the bags that slide and lock into place. It took about half an hour to install this rack on my bike. My seat post was pre-tapped but at an odd angle, so I had to bend the silver brackets slightly. Once attached it is solid, I have been riding about ten miles a day for the past week with it and I harldy notice it is there. I have not tested the 55 pound weight limit yet but I bought one of the smaller bags with no panniers. This is a great everyday rack, especially for this novice."
5,Completely Satisfied,Mounted fairly easily to my touring bike. My panniers fit well on the rack. I've carried up to 60 pounds on several occasions without any problems. I'm completely satisfied with the rack.
4,Good rack,This product arrived on time and in good condition. I had bought this for my father who has been using it for months with no problems.
4,yes,"it works, it holds stuff, i like it. Does not come with rubber adapters to attach to frame, had to buy some."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"I was looking for a rack for my road bike and though this rack is a ""mountain"" series, it works just fine. Not the least bit worried about it giving out or any future problems. The bag that it's designed to work with has a snug fit, yet is very easy to take on and off."
2,Cruiser bicycles,Not recommended for cruiser bicycles. Ordered it for mine and didnt work so I had to send it back.
4,Great rack if it fits your bike.,After a couple trips to the hardware store I was able to fit this rack on an my second bike (not the bike I originally intended this for). Now that this is on... it seems very sturdy. I like that it has a place to easily clip on a reflector or light. This rack seems easy to install if you have the 4 threaded holes (two by the hub and two on the body near the seat)needed. I did not. Even on my second bike I had to Magyver this thing to put it on. It would really by nice if they included some extra nuts for those that don't have the threaded holes on the frame.Moral of story... make sure this fits your bike and you will be happy.
4,Works well!,I bought this cheaper rack for recent bike trip. worked well enough. cannot complain about the overall performance or quality. Does take some effort to install though!
4,"Perfect, but watch out with cloth panniers.","My brother was using this pannier. We both had a great time cycling, but he couldn't carry a cheaper pannier (NOT ORTLIEB) because it had no support and it bent into the wheel. So watch out."
5,Best bike rack!,"Have one on every bike I own, have had one on every bike I'v owned, will have one on every bike I will own! Plus, all the attachment clip on bags make it cooler than any other rack options. Only drawback is that the rear tail light holder is flimsy since it has no support. Have had a few get caught up and bend which causes a fracture in the metal and eventually it falls off. But there are tons of other spots to attach a light, so its not been a big issue for me."
4,"Once you finally get it installed, it is great","The directions were useless to us - didn't even list the what parts were suppose to be included - we had 8 screws but 13 washers? Anyway, we have a Huffy Cruiser and while we couldn't figure out how to install the rack under the seat (we could figure out how to get it attached at the bottom) - Grandpa had the entire rack installed under 3 minutes. So, if you are handy this should be a snap - if you're not so handy (like us) then you'll probably have trouble simply due to the instructions being so poorly written."
4,Solid Bike rack,"I put this rack on and have made a few trips to the grocery store with some Panniers I bought from REI. The bike accommodated the panniers with no problems and it's been very easy to carry even some pretty heavy loads without any problems.This rack was pretty easy to install, looks nice and has been strong and stable.I also like the clip on the end for a the rear light. It makes putting on the light real easy, although the light has popped off once when I hit a bump while riding."
5,Lightweight and sturdy!,"Easy to install, works just as advertised, lightweight yet sturdy. Comes with all the nuts and bolts. I use small messenger bags on this with a bungee cord to secure it and it's wide/long enough to easily secure it to the rack. On bumps my bag/lock sometimes jump up a bit but nothing's ever fallen. I don't use panniers but don't see any issues with it in the future when I plan to use them, it doesn't look like heel strike will be an issue as long as I'm not using gigantic panniers geared for touring and not urban riding.There are not many negatives to say about this product. I have my bike seat pretty low and it seems to be too close to the rack to use a seatpost mounted taillight. The included rear taillight holder broke off when I accidentally bumped it on a signpost; the plastic was flimsy but I was able to superglue it back on with no issues after as long as I'm more careful in the future."
5,One of the Best,"I rank this with HYPERION by Dan Simmons and ENDER'S GAME by Orson Scott Card as my favorite science fiction experience in novel form. Yes, even ahead of the great RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA by Clarke.It has some of the best plotting I've read; handling multiple POV's attached to a single thread and weaving them into a seamless tapestry of delight. The science amazes, the characters live on in your biological Atrium long after the read, and the climax fires neurons into overdrive attempting to reach new levels of input in order to find out how it all plays out."
3,I Don't Know,I really can't review this item because 30 days after purchasing it I still haven't received it!!!!! Did it go by snail?
3,Not all poems are nice,"Algunos son feos, con una flecha en la cara, o otro que se quita la cabeza, pero saltando esos hay varios buenos. No rima casi en español."
4,"very funny, but misogynistic and a titular letdown","I just got this novel and finished it in under 6 hours. You can't put it down once you start. The style is refreshing esp. for West Indians, b/c it's entirely written in dialect--narration as well as dialogue, but it's still understandable for those outside the Caribbean. There is a stream of consciousness section that i found a bit confusing, but this is the first novel I just had to read aloud."
4,A humourous story of London's 1950s immigrants,"The humour in this book makes it palatable. Otherwise the straitened circumstances of the characters would make you cry. The title sums it up. The post-war period in London was one of high immigration, with people re-settling due to the war, and due to the economic demands of Britain's economy for migrant workers. This is the story of a few of those migrants, concentrating mainly on the West Indian community, but also featuring a Polish woman. The story shows the daily lives of its characters, their difficulties in finding accommodation, the racism and fear they faced, and the rare examples of friendship from the quasi-indigenous population. The book is an easy read, and short enough never to become tiresome. Selvon occasionally sacrifices narrative consistency to make a few points, and this detracted slightly from my enjoyment of the book. On the whole, though, this comes highly recommended."
4,HumorousCaribbean novel,"Read and studied this book in college some years ago and still tickled by it's humorous treatment of life in the"" Mother Country"" for the uneducated west indian in the earlier years of migration."
5,Engaging Story,"This book is a great story that engages the reader and flows well throughout the storyline. Joyce pulls the reader into this thrilling adventure and captures the essence of the mysteries of the sea. I would recommend this book for anyone, it's a good read!"
3,manual of home health nursing procedures,"The manual packing was not what i expected to see. It was simply recopied text that was wrapped up. really poor, I thought I was getting a book"
5,THESE GUYS ARE AMAZING,"You have to buy this CD!! These guys came to my school today and performed and they are great!!! It is amazing how much soung can come from just 5 guys. but anyway if you are a fan of classical music or a little jazz then you should buy this. I promise that you will love it.Thank you for reading my review, I hope it was helpful."
3,Good but not great,"If you like the more recent hits of the Scorpions like Rhythm of Love and Wind of Change, then this CD is worth the money. However, if you are buying this CD for the songs on disk 1, then I might suggest looking at World Wide Live. WWL has more energy and excitement. It feels like you are really at a Scorpions concert."
5,Anyone have anymore info about this author?,I have another book of hers under the name Kizzie Everhart Utay.
5,OT survey text,"The text is well written and provides an readable and understandable introduction to Old Testament survey. The writing is overall theologically correct, and the references are numerous and useful."
1,Disappointing seller,"It took nearly 4 days for the seller to tell me the product is discontinued when it was ""in stock"" when I ordered it. Buyer beware."
2,Disappointed.,"This product is very complicated to put together with many tiny tubes and parts and I have never been able to make it work. Additionally, the actual bath does not look as natural as shown in the pictures, but very artificial in sort of a blueish gray tone."
4,Duude.,"Great record, Damien. Hey everybody (even the dude in Sweden), this guy stayed at my apartment once. Based on his behavior there, I'd say go ahead and buy everything he's got. Then like it. Because you will. Because I say so, and after all he did stay at my apartment."
3,"Um, Ok.","This cd was ok, but if you are going to buy a damien cd, i recommend his first, 'waters ave s' because its songs are both snappy and meaningful, not just depressed like they are on 'departure' recommended only if you are a huge damien fan."
4,Soul's best-kept secret,"If you're into the sophisticated soul of Philadelphia International, you've got to hear this. From Sigler's great version of ""Love Train"", to ""Sweeter Than The Berry"" and the magnificient ""That's How Long I'll Be Loving You"", it's a treat from a singer way overdue for recognition. Great liner notes, too."
3,A generous 3,"New electronica should not be so repetetive, and sound-spectrally-limited. There's always a good beat to keep one going, and the hooks are generally solid. Yet I often found myself thinking they stuck with them for just a few too many loops. There are still some inspriring tracks on here, but they scarcely eclipse mediocrity. Backstreet Love is a crime against humanity."
1,Couldn't believe ...,"The story and the characters were very shallow. I didn't care one way or another if they won, lost, fell in love etc... there was no great bond keeping them together, barely any lust either.I was also annoyed with Tolemac, Camelot, So I read nearly all the names going that way <--- example: Kered = Derek. I am all for fantasy but this one was a bit hard to swallow. See you all in Wales... Oh I guess that'd be Selaw... *rolls eyes*"
3,Yummy!,I recently bought these for my mother because she has just quit smoking. She loved it! Brought a smile to her face to received 240 tootsie pops! Life is about being happy!
1,Bad,"This album is abysmal. Francis' voice is way past her prime, her patter with the audience is stilted and the end result is simply embarrassing. Stick with her hits from the '50s and '60s."
4,Worth Buying !,This album is extremely fantastic and worth buying. It was an album whereby this talented songbird performed a 'life' performance after disappearing for quite some time. The song 'Everybody's Somebody's Fool' is really well performed! and the rest of the oldtime hits found in this album is really great! Buy it and take a listen!
5,This CD is GREAT!!! Connie Francis is a survivor!!,Connie Francis was and still is a beautiful lady and singer. Her voice still sounds GREAT! Even if you aren't a Connie Francis fan you will love this CD. I would love to here from any Connie francis fans or maybe even Connie Francis herself!END
4,A funny read on parenthood,"""In the Beginning... There Were No Diapers - Laughing and Learning in the First Years of Parenthood"" by Tim Bete is, as is evident from the title, a humorous take on the parenthood. The title is self-explanatory and the book lives up to the promise. Certainly I laughed and though long past the stage of holding my boys with or without diapers (and those diapers were home made nappies), I learnt a little more about the parenting skills. May be in a few years, when I become a grandparent, the skills will come in handy!Tim writes well and writes with wit and humour, making liberal use of hyperbole. There is no doubt that the book will touch the typical American parent at the right spots.The book is edited and printed well. It will make a good present to yourself or your friend who has just become a parent."
5,Addicting game...,"I finally got this game yesterday, and I haven't been able to put it down! It's a shame that we will probably never see a US release of this game, because I'm sure it would be a big hit stateside. Despite the language barrier, the various features from the characters and the gameplay to the use of the DS touch-screen features really make this one of the best games I've seen so far on the DS console. I highly recommend this game to everyone!"
3,Ok,"The game is fun, and I get a kick out of some of the characters attacks.So far, my only two problems with this game is:1- How you have to find diferent puzzle like pieces to get knew characters.2- It would be a lot easier to have made it English, or give it an option to turn the text to english.Other then those two problems, it's a fun game, I suggest it to die hard fans and people who can actually understand kanji."
5,A FANTASTC value for the money!!!,"I purchased one of these chests for a pocket knife collection after reading the AMAZON reviews. Yes---Gerstner makes better chests but they cost four times what I paid for this one. Fit and finish are more than adequate, and it filled my needs perfectly. I immediately purchased another and the quality/fit/finish were also first rate. If you need a hobby chest for small items that is sturdy, attractive and well made you WON'T find a better one at twice the price. The AMAZON free shipping made this even a better deal--you just can't go wrong here!!!"
4,Beutiful pieces for any tabletop,"The only reason I knocked off a star is because they are made in China, and the pattern used to be made in England (I have older pieces I got only a few years ago that have Made in England stamped right in). But, that being said, the pieces look great, and outside of where they were made, I am not disappointed in them."
1,Poor packaging,"The items themselves are beautiful. However, receiving them broken is not. Items were ""repackaged"" from manufacturers packing and this caused the large platter to break. Very disappointing."
2,exactly what she wanted BUT,"These are the exact accessories to the China pattern my daughter has picked out for her wedding. They were to be exactly what we wanted to give her for a house warming present to use before Thanksgiving, but they arrived in the manufactures box so poorly wrapped that the China was chipped and the platter was shattered. Incredibly disappointed. Hoping the return and replacement process works."
1,Two Damaged So Far....,"Ok, so nothing against Amazon here as the first return was completely trouble free. After returning the first wok that was damaged due to poor packing on Scanpan's part, I sent it back and received the replacement today (only took 2 days to receive it). I opened the box, pulled out the replacement wok and it looks like it had been dropped as the rim of the pan is bent.Not too happy with Scanpan at this point."
4,Latest in the Home Library Collection,"Great addition to the growing library of hummingbird video library. Not my favorite, but worth the money for more video documentary of this amazing bird."
4,Good but..,not enough for everybody. It is not systematic enough to teach all that is needed for good writing but it does give a push to those who already have some capacity by focusing on important ideas and adding soime new ones.
5,Clear as a bell,"As with so much of Ayn Rand's writing, she takes on an issue (in this case, nonfiction writing) that seems hopelessly complex, and then explains it with such clarity that you're left wondering what all the confusion was about in the first place. If you're stuck in your writing, even if you've never read anything by Rand before, this book is priceless."
2,It Rained on my Parade,"The only reason this one got even two stars is because of the Prof and her Rottweiler. But even the poor dog didn't live up to his potentual. The story had an interesting plot, but it quickly became apparent to me that the narrative was two dimentional at best. To compare this book to any of Thomas Harris' is like comparing an Elvis on velvet painting to a DaVinci. Where Harris disgusts, horrifies and frightens one to death with his prose, Nykanen irritates. His monster is a bore. Plus it was unbelievable that his victims never fought back. If you want to be scared to the point of closing your book just to catch your breath, read ""Red Dragon."""
5,The Bone Parade,"Nykanen's use of words hooks the reader from the 1st chapter, which introduces the chilling main character. I recommend this book."
2,I agree it was pretty redundant,"And you better like graphic descriptions of sex and perversity. I couldn't finish it fast enough- like another reviewer said-it was redundant, you could have lopped whole chunks of the book out and made it more readable. Don't think I'll be sampling any of his other works."
2,Teenage masturbatory fantasy,"I was able to slog through this book in a few hours and after I was done, I felt like I needed a shower...that I had just spent too much time in the back row of the XXX theater watching bad art films (i.e. porno)...the plot is thin, the character development was bereft of life and the pacing is just wrong...I suppose the author would state that it was part of his ""art""...yeah well....in the eye of the beholder. All that's needed here to make this complete is a bad 70's soundtrack and a porn star mustache."
1,Rotten to the Bone!,"This is a terrible book and I regret ever having read it.Ashley is a mad artist who kills families and casts their likenesses in his sculptures. He numbers them and at the start of this book, he is up to his ninth family. There is nothing erotic about this book; it is just ghoulish and sick.This family has a teen daughter and a pre-teen son. The daughter continues coming on to Ashley even after he tortures the family and later wipes them out. The ending is as distorted as this miserable story.As bad as David Lindsey's ""Animosity"" was, this one is far worse."
2,"so-so plot, terrible characters, even worse writing","I, too, heard the comparisons to Thomas Harris. Forget it. The plot is intriguing at first, but the chapters written from the killer's POV are ludicrous: over the top and utterly lacking in any realistic insight into the mind of a killer (or an artist, for that matter). The ""heroes"" aren't much better and come off as total cartoons. The plot becomes more and more ridiculous as it goes along (why, exactly, would a serial killer with an entire family caged in his basement agree to have an art-student intern move in?!?). Nothing happens unless it can be used later as a plot contrivance (gee, that lecture about keeping water away from the hot metal seemed extraneous at the time!). And the writing... so, so bad. I rolled my eyes so often they hurt. Overbaked prose, mixed metaphors, misused words... this puppy's got it all."
1,NO STARS/WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,"If you bought, or want to buy, this book based on the cudos of the author - forget it. If you want this book based on the narrative of its contents - it's a lie. This book is nothing more than a ""snuff film"" - written by a sick excuse for an author. He tries to glorify his story by keeping his thesaurus close by so he can write ""big words"" - thus making him appear cerebral - but the attempt, like the story, like his accolades, are a digusting farse. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK or anything else written by this man."
2,Could have used a litle more polish...,"Not a bad book, but not great either. Half way through I was getting bored with the Sculptor hoping he would hurry up and get to the point because you know what is coming. this book is predictable,there were no surprises waiting around any corner. I was hoping the sculptor would do in ""Diamond Girl"" but that was not to be. In the end I was rooting for a Daisy Cutter to drop on the mine and oblitterate all the characters in one glorious ending. I do like Mark Nykanen's style though and will venture further into his other work. I don't recomend this one though."
2,Not my cup of tea.,"While the concept behind this book really attracted me, the graphicness of the novel just turned my way off. I'm not one to usually skip an ending, but I definitely cheater here... I skimmed the last 100 pages just to get this done. If you can get passed the graphic parts and if you like serial killers, then this may be a book to check out."
2,Disappointed,"I'll spare you the summary, because it's all been done before. This book had so much promise. In fact, I was one of those idiots who was encouraging people to read a book I was only half-way through. The plot was perfect, and I couldn't wait to see how everything would play out. Then everything suddenly went downhill very very quickly. The book went in a completely new direction, which included a pointless 100 page long scene. Please, that could have been 1 page long. Also, even with the 100 page scene, the book could have redeemed itself had it shown us what was going on inside the mind of the young girl who was kidnapped. That never happened. The book only got worse and more ridiculous after the long boring scene. I'm almost convinced someone else wrote a huge segment of the story."
2,Not as good as HUSH,"When I saw this book in the store, it was a great and pleasant suprise... I have been waiting for years for Nykanen to write another book. However, this one sadly just does not live up to my expectations. If you are looking for a great thriller, one that you cannot put down , and that actually has characters in it that you care about, put down The Bone Parade AND head for HUSH!! It is Nykanen at his best; I hope he writes more books that are as good as his first. Unfortunately, Bone Parade just is not even close."
2,very hard to finish...although I did,"An artist who casts his sculptures from the bodies of dying families...an art teacher who sends her best student to study with him...the current family waiting for death so disfunctionalthat the daughter turns against them and seduces the sculptor.Trapped in a bone cage below his barn. Wow, too freaky for me.My suggestion...if you ever meet Mark Nykanen in a bar...run for your life!!!!"
5,Black Day Blue Night is a winner!,"The story line for Black Day Blue Night is as creative and entertaining as any out there, the casting was excellent and a young Mia Sara didn't get nearly enough opportunties and exposure in that LA industry!"
4,Not a bad movie for a Friday/Saturday night,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's not a great action or suspense film, but not a bad little movie to watch on a Friday or Saturday night if you are looking to just kick back and enjoy a flick. I only wish it was available on DVD. I will plan on purchasing it if it's released, for now I bought the VHS version, which was failry decent quality, but on an HDTV greater than 32 inches all VHS' have a hard time keeping up with today's video quality. The movie starts out with Mia Sara catching her husband cheating on her and eventaully hitches a ride with the other woman. Along the way they pick up a hitch hiker who they later believe to have robbed an armored truck. The law is looking for him and eventually catches up with them all, but there are some unexpected twists. Pretty decent acting and Mia Sara's nice long nude scenes are a plus for any man looking too see her breasts. Enjoy."
3,Black Day Blue Night.,Typical good girl picks up bad guy movie. I thought Mia Sara and Michelle Forbes played their roles well and so did JT Walsh. Would have enjoyed it more if there wasn't so much redness in the movie.
1,C rated drive-in movie at best,"The concept for the plot is not new, but could be interesting to watch if done correctly. Unfortunately, the acting on all fronts was sub-par. Mia Sara had the same facial expression throughtout the entire film. I saw no ""mystery"" in this film; it was predictable with no surprises. This is separate and distinct from the actor's performances, which as I said above, was sub-par. This is not the sort of movie one would watch more than once, except, of course, if your interest is in seeing Mia Sara naked."
1,Not appropriate for the Blackberry Pearl,"Although the description reads ""Horizontal Leather Case with Belt Clip/Loop for the Blackberry pearl"" this product is not appropriate for the Pearl. On the second day of use I slipped the Pearl into the holder while attached to my belt and it slid right through the opening in the bottom of the case. Far larger than is necessary for the Pearl and with space for the Pearl to easily slip from the case during insertion, it is apparent that this case was not designed for the Pearl as indicated."
1,Not really worth it,"This was not an expensive product, but not worth it even at a low price. It had to be removed every time you pluged in the iPod, and since it issuch a soft rubber it broke very quickly."
4,Works well for light duty tasks,"I was taken aback a bit when I first opened the package since the whisk was a bit smaller than I expected. But my concerns abated when I actually used this to whip some eggs - works well with minimal effort. The extra loops really do make a difference.But, given the price, I expected a bit more robust construction. It is not flimsy, but it is a bit more on the delicate side than I would expect for the price. It's not the whisk to use when you want to blend dry ingredients - a conventional balloon whisk will tackle the big jobs much better. But, for whipping cream, eggs, and other liquid ingredients, this gets the job done."
4,Sure fire...,"The passtrack is quite comprehensive. The material is explained clearly and even a math-averse student can benefit. However, it might be best to supplement your exam preparation with some other materials. Stay away from the Barron's and ARCO prep guides--they are ""rush throughs"" that will leave you anything but ready for the formidable 7. Even more, Amazon has a great price... Good luck, future RR's."
4,Couldn't put it down,"Once I picked up this book, I couldn't put it down. It made me hang onto every word. If you start reading it, you'll stick with it unless someone comes along and pries it out of your hands. :?D"
2,save your money,Dont bother with this one the matches wer very short an s***ty get the best of volume 2 its waaay better
5,THIS IS EXTREME!,"This is an absolute must-have for any fan of extreme, hardcore wrestling. If you love Deathmatches, this is for you! DEATHMATCHES! DEATHMATCHES! DEATHMATCHES!"
4,Good stuff!,"I first heard ""Tear You Apart"" on Sirius (Alt Nation), and decided to see what the rest of their album sounded like. I discovered they didn't have a full CD yet, but I heard pieces of the other songs on this EP, and it sounded good to me.I recently bought the EP (got it really cheap on-line), and I am happy with it.Everyone wants to compare them to another band, so if I had to, I would say Depeche Mode. They don't remind me at all of the Smiths/Morrisey (thankfully), and although Interpol was very good live, I think this cd is better than Interpol's last CD.I was never into the Goth thing, but you don't have to be to like this music."
2,Morrissey clichés,I guess the new revolution in music has become apparent. The Killers and Interpol will be looked as the leaders that paved the way for this retrospective on The Smiths and Morrissey but She Wants Revenge will be a dot on the map. The songs have a definitive gothic feel and a melancholic overtone that avoid all of the essential clichés of this burgeoning style of music. Call me an ass but I'm already tired of this resurgence. Yawn.
1,"Redundant, Derivative","It's likely that the kids giving positive reviews to this album are shills, hired by the record label. From what I've heard of the album, it blatantly rips off the sounds that bands like Joy Division created over twenty years ago. Interpol can't be accused of the same crime, because they certainly established their own sound. I'd guess that the band is composed of studio musicians hired to hand the younger generation a shallow, watered-down Interpol. Don't buy this."
1,"Contrived text, poor lay-out & printing, 2nd-rate photos","I bought this book expecting an insightful and perhaps somewhat light-hearted introduction into Japanese esthetics, imagnative photography and outstanding book design. What a disappointment! Here the venerable Japanese lunchbox becomes the universal principle, the general compass, the ultimate paradigm for EVERYTHING-not just food and its presentation and esthetics but also commerce and technology, society, life style, you name it. Needless to say much of this is pretty contrived; the book reads as if it had been authored for distribution by the Japanese Chamber of Commerce. Most of the photography is either amateurish or archival. The lay-out looks stingy (single photographs as small as 4 x 4 "" on 10 x 10"" pages). The white on black printing is about as crisp and clear as if the pages had been faxed a couple of times."
5,Great read,"Really scary to think of how we are playing God, all be it with good intentions most of the time"
5,IF YOUR ONLY GONNA READ ONE BOOK IN YOUR LIFETIME...,"I'm not exactly a huge fan of Robin Cook. I actually never heard of him until I read this. I read a lot of books, and I think this is the best I've ever read. I'm not even into the whole medicine thing but I found this book most interesting on many levels. He slowly builds up the suspence until you just can't take it anymore! I finished reading this book in less than a day. I couldn't put it down! That's never happened to me before!!!I definatley recommend this book to anybody, even if you don't like reading! It's guaranteed to hold your interest. Someone should make a movie out of this! WOW!"
3,Some suspense...but more disappointment,"I enjoyed reading parts of this book because of the way that Robin Cook has the ability to intertwine medical research with suspense but ,about halfway through the book, you start to grow weary of the back and forth method that Cook uses to display the eagerness of Dr. Howard to solve the mystery before him. I must admit that the ending somewhat shocked me but overall I have to say that this was one of Cook's more cliche and simple novels."
4,Decent Read,"I found this book back towards the dusty shelves in the library(Im not exaggerating). Anwyay, I thought this book started off very slow and eventually got better towards the middle. I found the first 100 pages or so to be not that interesting, until Jason starts to get closer on the trail of Dr. Alvin Hayes. I found that the HMO thing was the key that held the plot together,but I found that Shirley being the evil HMO Vice-President to be alittle corny. I exepected at least some kind of CIA-like organization. The plot was overall pretty decent, and it's a good read if you haven't read anything in a while. I thought the characters were very well-developed, and his narrative was pretty good towards the latter half of the book. Not too familiar with Cook's books, but they're not too shabby."
3,A good read,"With the 1922 edition, a very good starter book for those interested in the origins on the irish and british. The author explores everything from the early and late eastern and african migratory patterns to the importation of mythology, techonology and trade during that time. A good read."
5,An excellent book filled with suspense,"I really enjoyed this book because of the mystery that was upheld throughout.I would like to recommend a science fiction author by the last name of pohl whom I have just read two of his books. One was Voices From Heaven, and the other was..., well I forget.I am now reading Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace and it is a very long read. He is just full of ideas and every single one goes into his book. If you want a challenging book with small print and a thousand pages then it's for you."
3,not good,"well... the real 'hunt' did not start until page 400 page 1 til 399 only told the story of keegan trying to find a lover. it was realy boring, but some parts were not bad."
1,this book disappoints me,"i had high hopes that this book could entertain me as much as his Primal Fear did. however, i was wrong. this book is totaly boring! the fun part did not start until page 300. And there's one thing that made me hate this book even more. i thought Mr Diehl was a professional author, this book proved me wrong. the story of the book is a combination of Forsyth's THe Day Of THe Jackal and THe Odessa File. and i can assure you that those two books are much better than this one. i mean, except for a few changes he made, the story of this book was exactly the same as FOrsyth's two books."
3,"Flaccid Thriller-- Starts Fine, Runs Out of Steam","This was my first (and last) Wm. Diehl. I liked the premise, and the first 50 pages were good-- then the long exposition of our protagonist's life and past, clumsy foreshadowings of plot twists, and embarassingly lame coincidences slowly deflated the whole thing. I read the last 200 pages without interest. As a thriller-writer, I'd place dozens of other practitioners ahead of Diehl, including Turow, Perry, early Ludlum, LeCarre, Iles... the list goes on and on."
3,Let's make a Diehl,If you read 'A Matter of Honor' by Jeffrey Archer and 'Eye of the Needle' by Ken Follett than you've practically read this book. Although interesting it seems like a copy of the aforementioned books. Good story..because I liked the other two and this WAS similar but it didn't seem original or gripping.
4,Essential Purchase if studying Terragni,"Granted, Eisenman's texts are challenging. But the diagrams and drawings more than make up for it. A great addition to any thorough library of Italian modern architecture."
2,"Giuseppe Terragni: Transformations, Decompositions, Critique","Forty years after writing his master's thesis on this Italian rationalist's two 1930s masterworks in Como-the Casa del Fascio and the Casa Giuliani-Frigerio-Eisenman has turned it into a book. Beautifully produced in the best Monacelli manner, crammed with diagrams and crisp black and white photographs, it's a beautiful object to contemplate and browse, but a very demanding read. Legendary as the first building is, fascinating though it may be to contrast it with the second, Eisenman tells us far more than any reasonable person would want to know about these two structures, and nothing at all about the architect and the factors that shaped his work. (Michael Webb is the book reviewer for LA Architect magazine.)"
5,Awesome Season,This is an awesome season for Stargate Atlantis with a few twists and turns that keep you interested. I love both the Stargate SG-1 series and Stargate Atlantis series. I've always been a scifi fan!
4,SG Atlantis,It is a fun show. I don't mind pulling this out every few months and watching it again. If you like good SciFi you will like this show and also especially the sister show SG1. Good purchase.
1,This episode (temporarily) ruined the show for me,"The basic premise of the episode was great, as was the explanation for the emergency situation, but the non-linear structure and constant repetition were annoying. And wow, I did not see that ending coming. Normally that would be a good thing, but the ending to this episode made me lose all interest in this show...until I found out that the writers did make things right in later episodes."
5,Stargate Atlantis Rocks!!!!,I love anything Stargate!!!!! One of the very few scifi series left on tv.....sad :o(
4,tv,they r a great tv show that i enjoy watch on a regular bases this way I don't have to bother with netflx
4,As Good As SG-1,"As good as the first seasons of SG-1, so if you enjoyed the beginning of SG-1 you will enjoy the first three seasons of this."
5,stargate atlantis season 3,A terrific follow up to season 2 and with a sting in the tail whichwas unforseen well worth the time to watch a second time roll on season 4.
2,Can't say until I can actually download it,"I ordered 5 videos within the week and was only able to download 3 of them. The other two are stuck on ""Allocating Space: 100%"" and I have 130GB of available space still on my 320GB drive(this happened on previous videos too). When they download, they are awesome, good quality, Unbox application is responsive and ever since I replaced my modem I get a steady 2400+Kbps download speeds so Amazon has got the throughput covered. They just need to work on consistency of delivery(never had this problem with Itunes in 18 videos I've ordeded from them).Anyways, i'm sure this SGA will be great just like Tao of Rodney but just wish Unbox would deliver the digital goods as well as Amazon delivers the physical. The low stars are for lack of satisfaction with the service not so much the show but the two are tied together for me and it's ruining my enjoyment of the content."
4,love sci fi and this is great,everything a sci fi should be. a little out there (as it should be) but has a great story line. can't wait for the next season.
4,Good stuff,"Good series so far. Don't have cable or dish so we are a season behind. We play catch up. Have to watch out for the special features though, too many spoilers if you've not seen the episodes before."
1,Disturbing,"I enjoy the series in general (3, maybe 3.5 stars), but this episode troubled me. I am not known for taking things ""too seriously"", and I can hardly believe I reacted as strongly to this as I did but the fact is I was appalled by the cavalier attitude toward Lucian Lavin's actions.*SPOILER ALERT*Lucian takes an herb to make himself impossible to resist - literally, impossible - and uses this to exploit everyone around him. Unethical in every sense, but in regard to the local woman, he - by thwarting their free will - effectively rapes them. Because of the herb they are unable to deny him, and it is clear throughout the episode that women are being effectively coerced into sexual activity they otherwise would never have consented to. Bad enough, but what I found utterly reprehensible was the fact that our ""heros"" treated his crimes like some kind of annoying yet amusing and harmless nuisance. A serial rapist! What kind of message does that send? Badly done."
4,Fischer's Mozart Reissued Again,"EMI has gotten more mileage with reissues than any other classical label. Sure they have the greatest archive of recordings in the history of music sitting in their vaults, but how many times do they have to reissue the very same performances on CD? Annie Fischer's legendary 1959 accounts of Mozart's 21st & 22nd Piano Concertos, with conductor Wolfgang Sawallisch conducting the Philharmonia Orchestra, were previously available (and probably still can be found used in the Amazon Marketplace) on a 2CD set that originally went for half the price of this title. That EMI Seraphim two-fer also featured Fischer's 1960 recordings of Mozart's 20th & 23rd Concertos with Sir Adrian Boult conducting the same orchestra, performances that have yet to resurface on CD. In all, this is certainly a five-star performance by Ms. Fischer, but EMI gets a one-star deduction for continually putting a new face on the same classic product and charging the consumer more money to boot."
4,solid folk-rock classic,"What an amazing album. Often compared this to their debut ""Mr Tambourine Man"", but the only real similarity lies in the fact that they are both extremely solid albums which predate this groups mostly successful (but sometimes disappointing) exploration of psychedelia. ""Turn"" has a more subdued, slightly darker tone than the first album. The unstoppable youthful energy of a song like ""I'll feel a whole lot better"" is replaced by a more subtle, surging vibe that is epitomized on the title track. Here, and on ""set you free this time"", and ""the world turns all around here"" the Byrds manage to sound optimistic, world-weary, and indescribably wise all at once. The only thing that keeps this from being a great ""rock"" record is the inclusion of some straight-ahead folk songs executed in a very understated matter."
4,Not just counting but a cultural experience,"Muriel and Tom Feelings have put together a book which counts from 1-10 in Swahili, but also through the rich illustrations introduces us to the culture of Africa. The book contains an introduction which explains the languages spoken and some informative details about the area. The book gives you the pronunication codes for the words. I was impressed by this seemingly simple book which is packed with sights and sounds of East Africa."
5,Counting in Swahili is Cool,"Along with its companion book, this is a wonderful children's book (but I love it too.) It not only teaches Swahili numbers, but a bit of east African culture too"
4,Helpful and interesting,These case studies helped me grasp the esoteric ideas of immunology. I would recommend this book to other medical students. It is succinct and to the point.
5,Best Galations Commentary I've Read,"I wasn't sure how relevant this book would be when I first picked it up. However I was pleasantly surprised that this book definitely has stood the test of time for being a great commentary on the NT Epistle of Galations. Martin Luther has done a wonderful job explaining the book of Galations and really hammers home the importance of justification by faith alone. This book was so passionately written and encouraging to read, it gave me a fresh appreciation for all that God has accomplished for the believer. If you read one book or Bible study about Galations, I recommend you make it this one."
4,Excellent book - for beginners...,"The author has well organized the contents, and provided a clear explanation of each of the topics (each topic is a step/phase in the overall BI implementation methodology).... Has a project plan template also...Good book for beginners in Data warehousing / BI."
4,Good Practical advice,The book offers good practical advice that can be used in the development of a Business Intelligence (BI) project / initiative. The over all road map provides a check list of issues to consider and offers a place to start in planning your own initiative. It is a good reference for individuals starting a BI project for the first time.
4,"Manu! oh, and the rest of the Spurs too ;-)","Im a Spurs enthusiast, but more than that I'm a Ginobili fan. So I've really enjoyed this purchace. It's got a great recap of the spurs season, and a buch of other cool stuff, my favorite being the Manu segment. I don't give it 5 stars because the Gino part was too short for my taste, but more than that because it has no audio or subtitle options. And the Ice-man part is kind of lame. Like another reviewer siad: it's just him driving around, no footage of his basketball exploits."
5,A great Fantasy novel that can be relived over and over!!,I read this book close to 20 years ago and it stands as one of my all time favorites! Some of the characters reveal some of the same personality traits as some of the friends that I shared the book with.
2,Large investment in time for little payback in information,"If you are interested in quickly learning about how to raise a VC fund, save your time and money. This book does not offer many clues."
5,Get This Book!,"A must for anyone wanting to know how VC firms work, structure themselves, and considerations for funding. This is an excellent case study that ought to be in a graduate program! It's as close as you'll get without working for a VC firm. I would suggest reading ""The Venture Capital Cycle"" first to get a general feel for VC and how it works. Then read the case study!"
4,Excellent introduction to an exciting asset class,"First let me start with what this book is not! It is not a textbook and it will not teach you the practical methodology of deal structuring, LBO modeling or valuation. However if you are looking for a well-written, non-technical book that illustrates the rationale and dynamics behind PE/VC investing, look no further.After diligently reading these case studies, I have become comfortable with the unique terminologies and thought processes involved in each stage of the investment life-cycle. A slightly greater emphasis on the technical aspects would have made this book perfect, but overall I have no complaints."
2,Read Cioran's translation,"When most of the public domain classics on Kindle are free or a dollar or two, it takes a particular nerve to scan a text, convert it and charge $10. Besides, you don't want the Cournos translation, you want the Cioran,published by Ardis in the 80's, which has a copious and interesting introduction, as well as appendixes which contain a considerable amount of material which was suppressed in all previous editions and translations, as well as a series of critical essays.The Petty DemonAlthough mild by today's standards, this material is kinky enough to never see the light of a 19th century day, but is integral to Sologub's lyrically sadistic vision. After you have savored the sheer miserable rottenness of Perodonov and the lyrically beautiful & slightly perverse Lyudmilla/Sasha episodes, go on to The Created Legend, which must be one of the strangest novels ever written."
5,MR.WILL DOWNING IS CLASS PERSONIFIED,"IM FROM SYDNEY AUSTRALIA AND AS MY WIFE SAYS IM ADDICTED TO WILL DOWNING , HIS VOICE IS UNMATCHED AND HIS EFFORTLESS SINGING HAS MADE HIM A LEGEND TO ANYONE WHO KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT SOUL THIS ALBUM IS AS GOOD AS ANYTHING WILL DOWNING HAS DONE AND THATS NOT EASY TO DO IF LISTEN TO THE COLLECTION . THE ONLY PROBLEM IS WAITING FOR WILL DOWNING TO RELEASE MORE BELOW ARE SOME THINGS I LIKE TO LISTEN TO WHILE WAITING FOR THE MASTER MICHAEL SPEAKS KEITH WASHINGTON CE CE ROGERS JOHNNY GILL (DONT LAUGH THE KID CAN SING) GLEN JONES JOE BRIAN MCNIGHT JOHNATHON BUTLER GEORGE BENSON"
5,Truly An Invitation,"Jazzy and Soulful/Smooth and Classy........Listening to this CD is a cleansing, de-stressing experience. When I first heard the song ""Island"" on New York's CD 101.9, I knew that the rest of this CD was a ""must have"" - especially when it was announced that the title of the CD was ""BY INVITATION ONLY"". This CD truly lives up to this title........it is an invitation to be transported from fast living, daily job/career pressures to something soothing, pleasurable, and quiet, romantic thoughts. For all of my fellow Old School R&B listeners, take note of Will Downing's version ""I Don't Want to Lose You""........one of the song that will be a true Will Downing trademark but at the same time keeps the spirit of the ""Stylistics"" classic."
5,Very pleased.,I am very pleased with my purchase. It was exactly as it was described to me and it arrived quickly. I will purchase from this sellar again if they have something I need for my library. Thanks for the book and the great service.
3,smells great,"A little too thick and sticky for my taste but it smells like heaven. Its also kinda small, but it works with the hook up conector. I would not get it again for myself but I think most people would not mind the texture, its also really sheer."
3,Not bad.,"I purchased this book to review for the Step 3. I am a resident in IM. I found the book useful overall, but it lacks many subjects that I thought were important. Its Surgery and Peds sections are especially poor. It does come with 400 review questions but these are mediocre too. Plus, the explanations of the answers are sometimes poor, for example, ""This is the correct answer."" -- I'm not kidding. Unfortunately, there isn't much competition for Step 3 review. You might try the Pre-test series instead. Their questions are tougher (too tough in Ob/Gyn) but more comprehensive."
2,You don't need this abuse,"A&L do publish individual question books that have pretty good questions. But THESE are dreadful. They are not at all representative of the style, distribution, or difficulty of the questions on the actual test. So why bother? You don't need to be this desperate: the test isn't that hard. Have you ever heard of the ""rule of twos""? . . for Step I, two weeks; for Step II, two days; and for Step III, a number 2 pencil! I did something like that (2 months, 2 weeks, and 2 days) and I did particularly ""well"". But the point is, I scored EXACTLY the same on all three parts! So get a copy of ""Ace the Boards"" and maybe Swanson's book, and go get some exercise; it's good for the brain! (Unless you've never practiced in the US; then I'd sign up for a Board Review Course like the one offered by NMSR) Good luck!"
4,Play a song for me,"This, of course, is the Byrds debut album. A lot of good stuff here, including four Dylan covers. One of my favorite Byrds songs, ""I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better"", is included here. Try it, you might like it."
5,The first is the best,"Mr. Tambourine Man is The Byrds debut album and is 31 minutes and 35 seconds long and was released on June 21, 1965. Mr. Tambourine Man reached #6 on the US Billboard Album 200 charts. It charted to singles from that album. They are: Mr. Tambourine Man #1 and All I Really Want to Do #40. This was The Byrds most successful album and the only one to peak under the top ten list. Also included are songs like I Knew I Want You, I Feel A Whole Lot Better, and Chimes of Freedom. This is a must to add to your Byrds collection."
5,very helpful for some,"This phonic, consonant-only dictionary is a life-saver for some people who can pronounce words but simply cannot figure the spelling. Some people cannot use a computer spellcheck because they have no visual sense of a word; some don't know where to start with a dictionary. For people who readily recognize consonant sounds this is a gift."
3,Afghan Guerrilla Warfare: In the Words of the Mujahideen Fighters,This book is exactly what it says it is and it describes specific military encounters in great detail and in an interesting manner but it odes not provide the more general overall evaluation from a countrywide perspective that I was looking for.
4,Useful in a practical sense,"Before deploying to Afghanistan last year with a Special Forces battalion, I read this book (along with ""Afghanstan's Endless War"" - Goodson, ""The Hidden War"" - Borovik, and ""The Soviet-Afghan War"" - Grau & Gress, eds.) to prepare for battle. While a rough read that could stand better organization, it had very accurate, pertinent information that was useful for a warrior. I personnal went to about ten of the battle locations (some of them were hard to avoid) and was able to follow the battle on the ground by the descriptions in the book. Additionally, on the road to Gardez, was able to discuss some of the battles with locals, who concurred with details. Valuable to me."
4,Informative Guerrilla Tactics,"I have a certain curiousity for Military Science and this was a great book that related to Guerrilla Warfare. There are a total of 15 Chapters, 14 of them with many different real life vignettes (around 92). As well many interviews with real life mujahideen fighters who were there. Anybody who posesses a distinct interest in Military Science or Guerrilla Warfare will certainly enjoy this book!"
5,THE BEST OF THE BEST,"For anyone who loves jungle or heard any of hype's or ellis dee's songs. You'll know they're instant classics. Amazingly both CDs come out true to their words. ""The Drum & Bass Experience"". I pratically listen to both cd constantly. I must admit I am a huge of Hype, and Ellis Dee caught me by surprise by featuring some tracks that I heard before on other compliations, none like this cd. It's a must buy for every junglist out there."
4,We Loved The Emotions and their Great Harmonies,"As teens we loved-loved the Emotions. I realise now the mainstream identify them mostly as the vocals on Earth, Wind and Fire's Boogie Wonderland - a fabulous song. But we really loved `Flowers' and `Don't Ask My Neighbour', and used to sing along word for word. Other great songs are `Walking the Line' and `Best of My Love' which brought the group great commercial success as a #1 R&B and Pop hit. I had to buy this cd."
5,Great CD!,I bought this CD for my Dad's Father's Day present. He loves it! CD is in excellent shape and delivery was prompt.
1,Buyer Beware,"Buyer Beware.Don't make the same mistake I did and purchase Ellen Brennan's other book ""Sugar Less for Life!"". With the exception of a few words, these two books are identical. I certainly didn't need two of the same cookbooks. Oh well. . .one of them will make a nice gift for a friend."
2,January 2005 - Better resources now available !,"This book is light reading and lacks knowledge sharing of glycemic foods. I was not looking for a Dr.'s book on food and recipes but this book was not fullfilling for me. It encourages the use of the 'bad' fats. It does encourage low glycemic foods and low sugar foods. What I am trying to share is that I bought two books at the same time, the other by ""GALLOP"" - Living the G.I. Diet, and found this one to be greatly lacking by comparison.Just one person's opinion - All the best"
2,Poor editing,"Poor editing - the oatmeal chocolate chunk cookies called for 1 tablespoon of sugar free syrup - yech! They were terrible! (The almond lemon cookies on the adjacent page (which aren't too bad) called for 1/4 cup plus 1 tbl sugar free syrup. Type of sugar free syrup not specified. Do they mean sugar free MAPLE syrup? Also, several recipes had ingredients listed that were not later called for in the recipe instructions? They need to go back and thoroughly re-edit this book. The recipes sound really good - I want to make sure I'm preparing them with the correct amounts of ingredients before I waste my time again."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this one and ""Energy and Power Risk Management: New Developments in Modeling, Pricing and Hedging"" (both published last month by John Wiley and Sons) earlier this week, and I have to say, I'm very disappointed with this one. The advice given is just plain bad in many cases. The writing is absolutely terrible. Whoever told these guys they could write should have his license revoked. I prefer financial books with a bit of spice, something to keep me reading. This thing isn't worth the paper it's printed on. My recommendation is to buy ""Energy and Power Risk Management: New Developments in Modeling, Pricing and Hedging"" and leave this load of baloney on the shelf."
2,"Not terrible, but not great either","I don't think this one will have a long shelf life. Problems:- It's not written well. The authors appear to be first-timers. I found it exceedingly boring and dry, even for a financial management book.- The advice given is often questionable, to say the least.- The people giving the advice have little standing. I work in risk management on the Street everyday and have never heard of any of them.One last nitpick -- the Introduction has to be the worst one I've ever read. It doesn't tell us anything about the book, why the authors have written it, or why we should listen to them. A book's Intro is like a handshake -- it provides a first impression of what the book itself will be like, and you don't get second first impressions. This one left my palm feeling a little greasy, like I'd just shook hands with an ambulance-chasing lawyer."
3,Interesting,"You can tell the author was an elementary school teacher. Interesting but shallow. Read the cover and you've read the book. But don't get me wrong, still worth a glance."
4,A good learning opportunity,"I ordered this book for a course I am taking this month. It was helpful to purchase it ahead and read it before, I am taking the class. So, I found it interesting reading to find out more about how I learn, my child learns and the children I work with learn. I would recommend this book."
5,"""You know much more than you think.....""","The rest of the quote is ...""because you think in more ways than you know."" This is the idea behind the Theory of Multiple Intelligences, and Dr. Armstrong really makes it interesting and fun to learn how to develop all of your intelligences. If you ever went to school (who didn't?), or are planning to go to school, READ THIS BOOK! It should be mandatory."
4,Facinating,I think it is interesting reading. I don't know if I go with every thing said in the book but it makes you think. The poor kids who were teased for bad grades should have this book. It spells out that you can be intelligent in many ways other than books.
4,not Sure,"A Published Date of this Book would have been nice to know about , and in my opinion would have been nice to see on the Book Advertisement on Amazons Website . Not that in this case would have made any difference as to whether I would have purchased this Book , or not , but for the other Book that I ordered from this Company it does."
2,THIS IS NOT ELTON...,"For me, this is just a British singer with a bunch of good songs, but let's not fool ourselves with this one. THIS IS NOT ELTON JOHN!! I mean, which is the best song here?? ""Recover your Soul""?, ""The Big Picture""? And what about the 80% of the album?? Believe me, I am one of the most devoted EJ fans from Venezuela, but I have to tell you that this record is depressing!! Even ""Leather Jackets"" is a masterpiece compared to this one!! Sorry...."
2,"The Big Picture?....Well, Not Exactly","First of all, The Big Picture isn't a bad album. It's just not what one would of hoped it would be. This album is a disappointment. Especially coming off a string of good albums like ""Sleeping With The Past"", ""The One"", ""Made In England"", and the greatest ballad hits collection, ""Love Songs"". This album is fairly low tempo. There are a few mid tempo songs, but not many. That's alright. It's just the low tempo ones are a little too long and unmemorable. There are high points. ""Something About The Way You Look Tonight"", ""The Big Picture"", ""Wicked Dreams"", ""If The River Can Bend"", ""Love's Got A Lot To Answer For"", are the high points. The rest aren't bad, they just don't seem to hit the right notes. Elton, by the way, sounds great. He always does. This was just a disappointment. Not that great. Could of been so much better."
2,dissapointing by his standards,"As a diehard Elton fan it's clear that this album shows signs of aging. Both he and Bernie have resorted to little more than formula based songwriting. Where are the stories like ""Ticking"" or ""Indian Sunset"", where are the stream of conciousness lyrics like ""Capt. Fantastic"" Not only are the glory days over but so is the joyride."
2,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...""Recover Your Soul"" is decent and adding the duet version of ""Live Like Horses"" would have been a slight improvement. The big single ""Something in the Way"" was only big because of the song it was paired with cuz it's nothing special."
1,Disappointment,"This album is depressing. After the astonishing comeback and return to form of 'Made in England' this album was a big let-down for me. All the songs sound like they were made with an Elton John songwriting program, there aren't any interesting melodies or modulations, the arrangements are uninteresting, underplayed, and by-the-book, and even his voice, which can lend viability to substandard fare, sounds detached and bored. Except in the hit, ""Something about the way you Look tonight"", where he sings with a bit of REAL soul. That's why the album actually deserves one star, it is a good song in his finest tradition. To be fair, he lost a number of friends in distressing circumstances in the period this album was made (putting it mildly), the album seems to have a mournful underlying mood, when there's any mood at all."
5,I couldn't put the CD away.,"As I do with most new CDs I purchase, I placed this one in my car CD player and figured I'd give it 2 or 3 times through. But this collection of songs is different. It was like a book that I could not put down, I just kept listening again and again. I have been an Elton John fan for 25 years and have listened to every album/CD. This ranks right up there with the best. His voice has such a rich quality to it, he just seems to get better with age. Listen to this CD one or two times through, and you'll be hooked."
1,NOT a Gerstner - Just No-Name Plywood,"This is not a Gerstner. It is not even a Gerstner International. It has no name plate. It is just a no-name product (of modest size and strength).Non-descript wood (not really beech, but some similar Chinese wood - all plywood).All drawers and caseword must be assembled by you via dzus fasteners (you know, that cheap stuff that simulates a barrel-bolt without having the same strength). You have to wedge the drawer bottoms with their pre-pasted felt into the drawer sides during assembly, so have your longest, thinest palette type knife around to tuck the felt into the bottom groves.Some hardware missing - No-Name maker's customer service very helpful and super prompt.Good for the craft and hobby crowd. I won't try to load it with 400 lbs of hand tools -- the normal use of such stacked chests.Amazon should not have let this pass as presented."
4,Good but sub titles,"I enjoyed this DVD, it was not as good as I thought it would be the Edelweiss Pirates where 12-18, these actors were 18-24 and some of it was about adult German resistance. However it does a great job of putting you there, the sub titles are annoying, but it makes it more realistic I suppose. It has some nasty scenes, but I guess its needed to explain what happened.Don't expect an epic action movie, it's more like a medium budget, made for TV movie with average actors."
1,***IMPORTANT READ***,It is not 500mg as stated. It is only 350mg. However it was an 100count bottle. I do not like being lied to and will not be dealing with this company again.
5,LONG TIME COMING...,"OMIGOD, I'M ABOUT TO BURST INTO TEARS!! THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST EVER, THEY DON'T DO CARTOONS LIKE THIS ANYMORE...CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS TO ARRIVE!!! I KNOW MY KIDS WILL LOVE THEM..."
5,Cool series,"Even though Thundercats was the more popular of two. This was a very cool Sci-Fi and sister cartoon back in the 1980s. This set is very good. The only knock I give it is I am not a big fan of the dvds packed overlapping each other (like this set), in baggies, or in cardboard pouches like some other sets. It is easily remedied though if you have your own stash of cd or dvd cases. I also agree with everyone else, they do need to come out with the rest of series."
4,Ahh nastalgia,"The DVD is of good quality. It's got all the features and shows and junk. And for the price, can't go wrong right.The show itself is pure nostalgia. I used to watch this show when I got home from school as a kid. Looking back now, I do wonder what I was thinking, but none the less, I enjoyed it.The show really is Thundercats in space. Even the way the show is drawn and the main villians transformation is the same! lol.But, if you watched it as a kid or want to give it to your kids to watch go for it!"
4,Great cartoon from the 80's,This was one of my favorite shows as a kid and now it's on DVD for a great price.
5,Silverhawks,This was what it was. The Silverhawks will never fade. The trill I still get when they fly out of the Mirage (which is their jet for those who don't know). WOW!!!
5,I love it,I was so happy to finally see this on DVD that I just had to have it and Amazon made things real simple. The price was nice and I had it sooner then expected.
3,show consitancy and episode list problems,"I love this show but it isn't consistant. I don't know if the ""T Great Galaxy Race"" was out of order or not but in that episode Melodia was disinagrated by mistake, it was suppose to be the Copper Kid in his vehicle, but she was in episodes after that. How could she be disinegraded in one episode and healthy in later episodes. They brought on a new Silver Hawk, but they continued to use the same silver hawks without as if he never existed. And I don't like the way the episodes are listed. I have catarax and it is hard to see from my sofa. I have to get close to the tv to see the names of the spiodes. I wish they had the episode list bigger. And I also don't like the last disc being double-sided. If they wanted bonus features and there wasn't enough room on 4 one-sided discs then they should of had a 5 disc set. For these issues I had to take off 2 stars."
5,Tally Hawk!,"I loved Silverhawks back in the day. Now my son does too. Sure some of the storylines and characters were a little hoakey (sp?) at times in the mid-80's, but so much better than the cheesy preschool art animation and rude, crude ""humor"" of todays toons."
4,"What's the hold up on vol 2, anyone?","Seriously...great show, but why don't studios ever finish what they started?!!! If anyone has news as to when vol 2 is coming or not, please put all our minds at ease."
1,I received the incorrect watch,wend i order the photo it was of a wristwatch and they send me a travel alarm clock i do not recommend this company for making me waste my time OK bye guys.
4,"More Fun, Because Less Real","Korda's ""Queenie"" and ""Curtain"" were interesting, though too somber and ultimately tiresome, because each was based (until the last third) rather too closely on real, and always unhappy, actors and producers. ""The Fortune"" is meant to remind you of Nelson Rockefeller's family, but Korda veers off so quickly into a polished TV-movie romance plot -- young, poor, brave farm girl loves old, super-rich, lonely city guy, and both have dark family secrets -- that it's laughs and sighs all the way.My mind-movie casting was Catherine Zeta-Jones and Mitch Ryan. The plum role is, as usual in this genre, the Matriarch -- maybe Tippi Hedren.In any case, a fine heroine and a good read."
3,An useful little book,"This book presents a wide variety of laces; eventhough the drawings are not very fine, they can be quite useful to the advanced lacemaker: it's easier to draw a pricking from a sharp design than from a detailed engraving. At the bottom of every page appears the name of the lace represented, and that is already a guide for those who wants to turn those drawings into actual lace. There are no prickings, diagrams or technical instructions; everything is left to the skill of the lacemaker. That's challenging, indeed. A well done historical introduction is one of the best features of this book, that will find its place in every lacemaker's library."
1,Greatly disappointed,"I expected the illustrations on the interior of the book to be (at least) at the level of the drawing on the cover, they are not. Yes, some useful content (and then go do your own research and your own drawing), but silly me - I thought the book offered that already completed (note: there is no patterns, no prickings - just back of the envelope-type scratched drawings. Check it out at the library or bookstore before putting down bucks."
2,where's the song at last you're mine,i have to say i love cheryl lynn this album is great but it's missing some very good song's she did a tune for the 1985 movie called heavenly bodies the song at last you're mine is an excellant track it peaked at #34 for a whole 10 weeks so i agree with the previous comment and the song fidelity so in order to be called a greatest hits all the song's should be in joel whitburns top r&b book
4,Excellent contribution to the world jazz subgenre,"On his first album as a leader, Sam Newsome does a great job of blending African and Middle Eastern elements into a jazz mix that sings and throbs. It's a rhythmic and melodic pleasure to listen to the tunes here, which are diverse and captivating.He does a unique cover of Ellington's Caravan, creates a version of Mongo Santamaria's AfroBlue that emphasizes the ""Afro"", a beautiful rendition of the gospel song Go Down Moses, and the best Crystal Silence, by Chick Corea, I've ever heard after the original.The other tunes were written by Sam (soprano sax), who's complemented here by a vocalist and players on oud, bass, and world percussion (dumbek, ghatam, and congas). There's a great, long tune, A Swedish Massage in a Turkish Bath, that lets the musicians stretch out--without one false note.A worthy addition to your world jazz library."
4,"One arc closes, another starts","Beautiful manga, and so happy that the translators kept the original names for the attacks instead of using some dumbed-down English counterpart. Sure, Japanese English might feel off to some, but it's how Japanese do it, deal with it. Usagi is reunited with her prince, yay."
5,SAILOR MOON FOREVER!,I have been reading/collecting all the Mixx Pocket mangas and they rule! I love Sailor Moon and have been a big fan for about two years! READ THIS BOOK! I even have a Sailor Moon web site!
5,Fantastic Manga,"This book was so awesome, I loved it! The artwork was of course, gorgeous, especially at the beginning when Sailor Moon is fighting Metalia. And then Chibi-usa appears! This book is really funny too. I love Mercury's new attack, Shine Snow Illusion! Sadly, it's not very effective. I'm really glad Mixx stuck with the Japanese names for the attacks, like ""Sparkling Wide Pressure"" instead of something dumb like ""Jupiter Thunder-Clap Zap."" And I love the introduction of the two minor characters, Kotono and Asanuma. This is great! I love it! So far I have Sailor Moon 1-4 and Sailor Moon Super S 1-2, and I'm still collecting! Buy this book! Right now! Quit reading this and go buy it!"
1,just learn the language,"i actually sat down with my friend and translated most of volume four from japanese (my copy) to english (her copy). it was amazing to see how many mistranslations there were. in addition to flopping between name spellings (they do this a lot in other volumes and other series), the print is way too dark, names were changed, some of the sound effects were missed, and in my honest opinion, just learn japanese and buy the original manga. this isn't worth the buy. espeically since the pages will fall out after a month or so if not sooner"
4,XXXX,"Yes it is pornographic, but that is what *Tijuana Bibles* were. I remember quite well when in high school in the 50's, a few were passed around until quite tattered. And, this was at a Catholic boys school. For fun and games and an introduction of a type of porno, this edition can't be beat. If the reader hasn't been totally brainwashed by a religion, purchase it and have fun.."
3,Not so hot,"One reviewer correctly compared these to the ""dirty pictures"" most people saw in junior high school. This is an accurate description. Most of this stuff is not that funny or particularly erotic. In fact, it gets dull pretty fast. The cartoons with Amos & Andy, Laurel & Hardy, Hitler, and Mahatma Gandhi (that one must be seen to be believed), and a minstrel-like Joe Louis are interesting largely for historical reasons. But the takeoffs (no pun intended) on Betty Boop, Lil Abner, Popeye, etc. are surprisingly flat, considering the unexplored comic possibilities (though the Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck segment is good for a few laughs). Be warned though, some of this stuff (especially in the last chapter) is really gross even by modern standards, so proceed with caution. Overall, it's more of a curiousity piece more than anything else."
5,Excellent,"Great all-inclusive history of a legendary underground art. Hats off to the author for compiling so many different versions of these bibles, and telling the tale of their history by using great examples."
3,Of archival interest,"...Interesting academically, perhaps, or as a cultural artifact, but if you're a fan of erotic cartoons and are after genuine wit or bawdy humor, try something closer in time to the present, such as Dark Horse Comic's new edition of ""Little Annie Fanny: Vol. 1."" These cartoons are mostly like the scribbles you passed around in grade school, and their erotic impact is lost, nearly a century later."
1,Be forewarned - Quite pornographic,"Based on the description, I assumed that this book was more politically subversive. Disappointingly, however, the content material was only subversive in that these comics used well known icons of the time in explicit pornography. The art is generally competent, the wit less than so. As a historical artifact it was interesting for about one viewing and basically then only to realize that people in the 1930's used the same slang for genitalia. We returned our order."
3,A good memoir.,"June 18, 2002This is a well written book, but not an inclusivepiece of research. The author writes of hisexperiences in South America with skill and passion,but a reader should come to the story with the fullknowledge that he is reading the work of an interestedobserver and not that of an anthropologist, orsociologist, or even much of an activist.Still, I'd recommend this book to someone who wouldn'tnormally be interested in the subject matter. It's apleasurable and moving read. Author Joe Kane seemsmore interested in the people he met during his travelsthan in cleansing or condemning his various subjects.Persons truly interested in the puzzle that is big oil,bad politics and embattled natives in South America,however, will probably finish `Savages' with as manyquestions as answers."
3,Savages,"I have given this book what I would call a neutral rating.I only added it to my last purchase to exceed the $20.00 threshold, I was of the opinion that once this was reached the delivery would be free.The advertised and heavily pushed FREE Delivery is apparently only available in USA.It would be recommended practice to make this more obvious.In addition to the above I have yet to read the book."
3,"Great tale of the Indians, slow tale of their political fate","Joe Kane rings true.His clear intelligent writing style brings the world of the Huaorani alive. He lived and travelled with them and gained their respect. He brings alive their toughness, compassion, and respect for their environment. It is as close to a another people as the reader is likely to get.But Kane wanted to tell the larger story, the story of the economic and politcal forces arrayed against the Huaorani. At this task he fails. He didn't fail in the facts or in bringing the story to its inevitable conclusion. He fails because he bores us. The first priority of art is entertainment. And his book became dull in long sections dealing with local and international politics and money. We know money corrupts and power wins in the end. Teach us something we don't know- entertain us with more stories and insights into the Huaorani"
3,A bit implausible,"Although this book gives a clear warning about the effects of ""Civilized world""'s greed for oil, it is somewhat too much fictionalized to be fully credible. It's a pity, because the basic idea is good."
4,"I like this guy, but the titles are wrong","There are 15 titles on this CD, but there are only 3 listed & they are wrong. So, don't judge this CD by the few titles. It's an excellant CD, & I would suggest anyone who likes southern soul to get it."
2,A SO-SO VISOR MAGNIFIER,This item isn't very well made but you can't really expect more for its price.
3,Good product for the money,"This product is a pretty good buy for the money. It has very good magnification, adjusts easily (even to my melon head) and offers okay lighting. The internal flip-down stereo lens and external mono lens offer a good range of magnification. The side lights produce a decent amount of light, but at a distance of about 16-18"". I would have preferred it a little closer, but that's just me. The LED lights are fairly cheap and the switches sometimes need a little exercising to light up fully. My only real complaint is the hood tends to droop down if you're looking straight ahead. Not a problem if you're looking down though."
5,great author,A great read by a great author - finding Campbell-Barnes decades after she published this novel. Book in great condition!!
4,Great support but sized a little small,"Had been searching for some good compression shorts and tried many brands (Nike, Under Armor, Asics, etc.). From those brands I had pretty much concluded that I wear a men's small, but then I found these McDavid shorts for cheap, and well....I bought them. Build quality is high, as expected from McDavid, a brand I normally associate with therapy products. The shorts really emphasize ""compression"". Other brands aren't nearly as tight, so just be aware of that before purchasing."
3,McDavid Deluxe True Compression shorts,weist is a tight fit their ok will most likely not get any more of these i like the nike ones better.
4,DAMA DE HIERRO,"GREAT CD BY MERENGUE'S NEW ARTIST DANIELA--A MUST HAVE WITH GREAT SONGS---ME ENGANAS,VENENO,SIN EL JUST A REASON TO GET THIS CD,SPECIALLY IF YOU LIKE FEMALE MERENGUE ARTISTS..ALSO CHECK OUT NEW ARTIST FLORANGEL--DEVUELVEME MI CORAZON--2 GREAT CDS BY PUERTO RICAN BEAUTIES!"
5,Unflinching and fiery,"This autobiography of the last days of her quite obsessive relationship with Sita is the story of a dying love affair, where each day's petty slights and delightful surprises are digested for the insightful truths and harsh realities of self analysis. Like Violette Leduc, Millett charts every moment and every emotion during the days of bliss and the days of spite in the struggle to save the love they share, until Sita's ultimate betrayal by leaving for a man. Included in this new edition is a portion of the elegy Millett wrote after Sita's suicide in 1978, which is a stunning finale for this captivating memoir. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find this at all depressing. Rather, I found this book uplifting and mesmerising."
5,A must for every serious astrologer's library,"Celeste Teal's ability to explain and teach complicated concepts in simple, understandable language is just incredible. A copy of ""Eclipses"" should be in every serrious astrologer's library, and be read by all who desire a deeper understanding of their destiny.Bette Rose in Denver"
3,This book is a Hard read.,Not very Interesting. Very technical.Full of examples of what happened to others.Not much instruction of how to analize your own eclipse.
5,How both personal and global interest can be served through a better understanding of them,"Eclipses play an important role in our lives, but usually are given only astronomical treatment: professional astrologer Celeste Teal draws on nearly thirty years of her background to explain how they also act as cosmic telegrams in a ECLIPSES: PREDICTING WORLD EVENTS & PERSONAL TRANSFORMATION. It's the first book to link astrology with eclipses, showing how both personal and global interest can be served through a better understanding of them.Diane C. Donovan, EditorCalifornia Bookwatch"
3,Less than Interesting Experiment,"Uninteresting techno sounds blended with standard Steve Roach material. Steve Roach does better on his own or when combined with other ambiant artists. I bought this CD because I'm always interested in whatever Steve Roach is doing, but I think this one will go into the dust-collecting shelf. However, it is good to hear experimentation because sometimes it really does work."
1,No fun,"What a drag. Norrington squeezes all of the fun out of this music. The strings are thin and you can barely hear the trombones on William Tell. Plus there are far too many intonation problems. For fun and wit, with great style and panache, try the Dutoit and the MSO."
5,And never the twain shall meet... til now.,"This is such a cool, swinging concert with both headliners in top form and playing beautifully. My personal favorite is ""blessed are the poor."" It has a dreamy, meditative quality to it that seems to transcend the other songs in this performance."
3,Your better off buying a better machine,This is very time consuming due to lining up the suction port just right.
1,Does not match description,I Was sent the wrong bible 2 times- bc the product does not match description and needs to be updated.
3,Small print edition!,It has very small print and is difficult to see for older people. The product lacks this in the description.
3,Bible,"My husband thought this would come with a clasp that you could close. Other than that, he likes the product."
4,"Great references, case not as pictured","Picture states it is Burgundy with Snap flap...Amazon is currently working on that issue to resolve it for me. It came with black, traditional open leather cover. Other than that glitch, fantastic little Bible with good reference information, red letter, easy to read, nice size to hold in your hand. Thick and sturdy. Really love it!"
5,An excellent read,"This is a book I have reread many times. The premise is original, the characters are interesting, and the mythological ties work believably. It's one of the better stories using the ancient Central American Indian mythology. It reads almost more like a mystery to me than SF.If you are lucky enough to find a copy of this book, you will most likely keep it forever."
4,Decent,Thick soft and fairly easy to put on by self. One thing bad is tie down. I run a bungee cord from under so the high winds won't blow it off. The self contain bag is nice. Have to unscrew antenna no big deal. This has a good fit though.The price is good for quality of cover.
5,great fit,"was impressed with fit of cover, and thickness of material, seems well made, nice touches through out, including storage bag and grommets for bungee cord to secure to car"
1,Don't waste your money on this dvd if you have the Sex n' Drugs n' Rock n' Roll dvd !!!,"If you already own Guns N' Roses Sex n' Drugs n' Rock n' Roll dvd DON'T BUY THIS DVD! It is the EXACT same dvd only with a different cover on the dvd case and the dvd itself. Not only that but it appears to be a bad quality copy of that dvd! Please save your money! If you have to buy it, get the original Sex n' Drugs n' Rock n' Roll dvd at least it's a better quality dvd with a MUCH BETTER TITLE!!!!"
4,Definitely worth the price paid!,It's plastic and has lasted a solid year so far with abuse from all four seasons. Doesn't leak and lights up the back yard. What more can I say......
4,A fine collection of his Columbia recordings.,"This compilation focuses on Z.Z. Hill's Columbia recordings. If you are only familiar with Z.Z. Hill's Blues and Southern Soul recordings for Malaco Records, you'll be in for a surprise. Why? Most of the songs on this CD have a Philadelphia Soul feel to them (especially the ballads) and there are even a few straigt-up, lushly orchestrated Disco numbers--in short, Z.Z. Hill's Columbia recordings were far more commercial than those for other labels. Decent sound quality, a good essay and informative discographical information round out the package nicely."
3,Good Lost Material,"Interesting capture of T Rex live, with mediocre sound quality. Often times the crowd overpowers Marc and the band, but great song selection and energy overcomes some of this. Good addition for folks who already own most of the catalogue."
5,Extra 30 mins of extra's for region 1?,"This is a super disc. I have all the region 2 discs of palin's adventures. I think I might be dead before all the region 1 versions are released. I did notice that this dvd claims 120 mins of extras, where as the region 2 version has 90 mins of extras. Please enlighten?"
4,Very nicely done!,Michael Palin has one of the best jobs in the world! This 3 DVD set shows off one of the worlds wonderous mountain regions and shows the all the cultures that touch this region. They explore not so much the mountains themselves but the scocial and politcal makeup of the regions as well. There is a very personal look inot the lives of the people in the area and their culture. It is done quite well but Palin is a bit of a dork from time to time and its painful to see him force himslef on the people even though very entertaining at times. Totally worth owning if you plan on visiting the region or are interested in this area. Typical high quality BBC documentary.
2,not that sturdy,"picture doesn't show the way the clips attach on the sides, snap-on hooks that clip over the bar, is not as sturdy as I expected."
5,Every bit as good as brand name,The cartrides we purchased performed as well as the brand name. What more can you ask for! My wife says they are better. Since she's the one that uses them I'd take her word for it.
3,Smaller than described,"Caveat: I didn't use this bag. Returned it as soon as I received it just by looking at the capacity.The idea is great, but it certainly didn't have enough space. The main compartment is too deep and it seemed like the bag would be way too bulgy once you put all the stuff in. I think the bag could've been a bit wider and thicker to accommodate. Twin+ moms, this is just not big enough for everything you need, unless you are just going out for a few hours."
2,Love the features but this bag is not good at all,"I used my backpack like for 5 months and the seams by the zipper falling apart after like 40 uses. It never happened to me ever in my entire life though I'm complete ""backpack person"" and I never had anything else but a backpack.. Next time I will rather go than for a special backpack for normal backpack with all life warranty and buy changing pad for it."
2,used twice and falling apart,We have only used this twice and already the mesh front has torn. I agree the cooler at the bottom takes up to much space. I currently use that section for blankets. This bag is not worth the cost. It is very cheaply made.
2,too SMALL!!,I honestly loved the idea of this bag ! sadly it is so small inside! the cooler on the bottom takes up to much room!!! if you need space and pack a lot of items then this bag is not for you ! im returning mine tomorrow i really liked this bag and was so excited to get it and change over diaper bags i wish we could use it but its just too small inside .. i would say maybe not even half an arm length deep.
2,Not too functional as diaper bag,"Too much space is used up by the cooler compartment and leaves little space for diapers, snacks, or an iPad as advertised. The side bottle holders aren't sturdy enough."
1,NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY,"I received the Baby Sherpa and within a few weeks, the zipper on part of the compartment broke making it impossible to hold a baby bottle of any type. Also, the mesh is falling apart. You can't hold as much as they advertise. I don't use the Sherpa more than about 4 times a month and it looks like I have had it for years. NOT WORTH THE MONEY EVEN IF IT ONLY COST $20!!!!"
2,Poor zipper design,"Faulty zipper - Before I even had the chance to use it, the zipper wasn't working properly. This seems to be a common issue in other reviews. I thought it might have been others overstuffing the bag, but the zipper design is poor with a weak hold and easy to mis-align. Had to return the item which is too bad because I liked other design aspects of the backpack - all the compartments, hooks, and canvas material. Though, I did find it odd that the cooler/food compartment on the bottom of the bag had a hole (for ventilation or drainage, I suppose)."
2,"OK Design, Terrible Quality","The design of the bag seems adequate. There are plenty of pockets and compartments including the semi-insulated one on the bottom. I am appalled at the low quality of materials. The thread looks like cheap heavy duty polyester thread. Cheap thread makes it fall apart much faster. I would not expect more than 3-6 months use (yes, I am sure it is designed that way), based on my experience with other backpacks. I would be terribly afraid of washing it. What good is baby stuff you can't wash?!? The shoulder straps have terribly inferior padding. The waist strap is not padded.Overall, very disappointing for the price point. It's going back."
3,Not worth the money,"I bought this bag after reading many reviews on this and other bags and the specs seemed to fit my needs. Well, first off, the bag does not fit as much as the description claims. The bag is shorter than it looks, as the insulated compartment takes up the bottom half of the bag. I now have 2 children and it is difficult to fit a days worth of supplies in it for 2. Within 30 days, the large carry handle strap began to fray. I tried several attempts to reach the company for replacement, but never received a response. I have had the bag for a little over a year now and the more I use the bag the more it falls apart, now the mesh compartment is comming apart. I am currently in the market for something larger and more durable. I might just go with a regular hiking backpack. Don't waste your money, all you are paying extra for is the fancy embroidered name on the front."
3,it was okay,"well, it was okay. the video's weren't quite clear but i have to say that it is a good collection to have of mariah's video's. the disc was messing up in some parts and the view wasn't clear...the views was also unstable. i love her videos though. i was kinda dissappointed not because of the videos but the way it was made. it is boot-leg (fake production) unauthorized!"
2,apparently another disappointment,I give this disk 2 stars because there appears to be some previously unreleased material here.From what I can gather on the web this appears to be partially a rehash of previously released videos. Fans will probably never be rewarded with the complete unabridged catalogue of Mariah's videos in any coherant package.Here is a track list for this disk:HoneyHeartbreakerMy AllWhenever You CallOne Sweet DayI Miss YouAll I Want For Christmas Is YouYour ImaginationHeartbreakerWhen You BelieveSweetheart
5,Our Solarian Legacy,"Our Solarian Legacy is an articulate, well-researched, intelligent compilation of new and ancient data. It is presented so that readers may contemplate the probabilities of who we, as humans, really are, how we came to be on Earth, what motivates our behavior towards each other, and why our social order exists. The primary stories of our origins (religious versions/Darwinism) are called into question when held against scientific evidence and recorded histories of many cultures. Von Ward's ability to cut through the rhetoric and peel back the layers of altered or ignored data, reveals true information rather than convenient answers. This book is the doorway to the New Story of who we are. It's up to us to cross the threshold."
5,Hope for Self-Learners,"Whether you are interested in religions and their calendars, concepts of time and personal potential, unrevealed discoveries, or research into the latest principles of human truth, Paul Von Ward leads us into a new era of awareness. Reading this book is like listening to a man who has been alive on planet earth for millennia and understands the implications of every discovery already brought to light, and a few that have yet to be acknowledged. He shows what a truly aware human being is capable of, in the light of ancient truth, artifacts and modern pursuits into the subtle sciences. I loved every page and drank deeply of this book. It's all one river of consciousness here!"
2,Call it my attention span or something...,I thought the ideas presented in this book were very interesting but I dunno maybe it's the way it's written or a bit beyond my scope. I didn't find it very interesting or readable. I stuck with it for as long as I could before I gave up and got rid of it. I didn't even get halfway through the book. I can see some of the points he was making though.
3,Okay as far as it goes.....,"I had high expectations of this book, but they really weren't fulfilled. The essence of the author's hypothesis is that ETs are behind the origins of humanity. That's fair enough, and he presents a lot of supporting evidence, but there are simply too many holes. Nevertheless, I applaud his conviction that neither Darwinian evolution nor biblical fundamentalism have relevance in the quantum age."
3,Great for about 5 minutes,I wanted a balm with a very intense feel. Ive tried the ky brand and they were good but i wanted more. The reviews on this product seemed to be want I needed.It is very intense with the mint feel as stated BUT it only lasted for maybe five minutes.I'm giving it a 3 due to the quick wear Off
1,does not work for me,Cooling feeling right when you put it on and then nothing. No change for me at all. Unhappy with the product.
4,life and love during wartime in malta,life and love during wartime in malta set during the germain bombardments of the island country. a good read
3,Pleasant.,"If you are interested in finding out more about Malta, especially its role in World War II, you may find this book interesting and helpful. If you are looking for an exciting novel, strong plot, and individualized characters, you may want to look elsewhere. The strongest ""character"" in this book is Malta itself. The other characters seem like window dressing--not fully developed, not unique. Even the love story is predictable. Short on plot, the main interest seems to be focused on whether the Maltese will survive the war and what country will dominate them. The book has lots of exciting ingredients--jukebox history, unusual setting, blackmarketeering, dogfights--but the book does not jell into a coherent whole."
2,More or less useless,"The book is flowery and full of pretty pictures. There are some interesting ideas but none of them are original and they are not fully fleshed out. The author claims to use ideas from Buddhism but it appears has only a superficial understanding of it's priciples. Lots of nice quotes, etc. but they get cloying after a while."
5,My new favorite relationship book,"I read this whole book through from cover to cover and loved every page, then gave it to my husband to read. He read it the next day and we've been talking about it every day for the past week. It has really helped us to see ourselves differently, to take responsiblity for our actions and feelings, and promise to help each other be happier by first becoming happy ourselves."
3,Could have been better if Sugarfix wasn't on it,"Thank Heaven for Little Girls is a good Dwarves album , to bad they ruined it by putting Sugarfix on it , which is considered by many to be their worst. I just hate having to listen to the first 12 songs and then cutting the cd off. But buy it anyway if your a hardcore Dwarves fan"
4,"Thank Heaven is good , but Sugarfix had only two good songs","I have to agreee with the reviewer Mike below that the album Than Heaven for Little Girls was an awesome album , but the last 13 songs that were on the ""Sugarfix"" album werent all that grand though ""Reputation"" , and ""Is There Anybody Out There"" were worth listening too. It wasn't as bad as he made it sound , but they could have been better"
1,Horrible Dwarves Album,"Thank Heaven , and Sugarfix are the worst two Dwarves albums ever recorded. And they are on one disc too. Thank Heaven is a still raunchy Dwarves , but musically it's slow , and mediocre. Sugarfix is the album that came out after they pulled the hoax saying He Who Cannot Be Named was killed in a bar fight , but that album is terrible because it isn't raunchy , and it's boring as .... Stick with Blood Guts And Pussy."
5,book review,"This is a really fun book about a place that most people don't think of as anything more than an extension of New York City. New Jersey is far more, truly being a ""Garden State,"" just as the New Jersey license plate proclaims, full of history AND mystery!"
2,rival 1060-c,"well built, take apart to clean, very noisy and the setting for the width of slicing moves to much and thickness changes."
2,all shnow and no go,"Patience may be its own reward, but then the person who thought up that little ditty wasn't trying to slice a rare roast beef in a hurry. I can only suggest that if you intend to do much slicing, you consider a heavier duty machine..."
1,Not Good,"We use a food slicer several times a day... ever since we were in food service and got used to one in the commercial kitchen. Our first home slicer was a Rival 1040. Excellent little slicer for the money. It would slice through 5 lb cheese block with ease (slicing cheese is a bigger test than meat). But it would not slice through a telephone book (don't ask) and so we had to replace it. By then the 1040 had been replaced with the 1060. BIG DISSAPPOINTMENT! 1. It does not slice through 5lb. block of cheese. Bigger moter but worse gears (they slip). 2. Instead of one button to push with the other hand, you have two... and they make no sense what-so-ever... because when you let go of them the blade keeps turning until you push the button again... no safety here. 3. It's messier and clean-up is more difficult. There is NOTHING about the 1060 that makes it better than the old model and much that makes it worse."
1,Poor Construction,"This model looks so nice and I thought it would work well. Well it doesn't. The main portion where the blade is, wobbles when you try to slice the meat or cheese. It does not cut......I sent it back....."
4,Great except when your kids forget to put the lid back on.,Love this dispenser but always check the top is on tight.. Flour gets messy all over the floor when you tried to pour it and the lid came off. :)
1,Can't keep the top on!,"There's always the possibility that I'm doing something wrong but no matter what I've done so far, I can't make the top stay on this thing! I hate returning things, so I'm still trying to use it, but it's just a disaster waiting to happen. The first time that the sugar ends up all over the floor or the counter, this thing will get filed in the room of never used objects. In the meantime, I've found that if I can keep the pourer side closed, I can keep my thumb on the back end while I'm pouring the sugar. I wish it worked because I'd love to just grab it and open the pour spout to fill the sugar bowl, rather than getting the canister of sugar out and fumbling for something to spoon it into the sugar bowl while several tablespoons of sugar miss the bowl completely. Same goes with baking, making lemonade or sweet tea, etc."
1,What a pain!,"This is the most difficult thing to put together. We had to go back to Toys R Us twice to return and get a new one, and then, let them put it together. They could only put it together on the third time/third different set. What a joke. Now my sons hardly play on it. Yippee!Forget it and get something different."
2,impossible to put together,this climber looks great but is nearly impossible to put together. it took two grown men to lock the mechanisms into place and yet the parts kept popping back out once engaged. i had to return this item and do not recommend this to anyone. little tykes needs to do better quality control on this one.
4,My daughter loves it!,"This is a great climber/slide for a small yard. It was on sale which was great. Putting it together was a nightmare. Side B broke twice, thank goodness Toysrus let us exchange both times. You need a lot of soap and strength. But once its together its very sturdy.Seeing how happy it made my 2yr old made it worth the hassle. She has no trouble getting up the side or the tube by herself. We actually have to drag her from it when its time to go in. I would recommend this climber/slide."
5,Endless Slide & Hide/assembly,I purchased this Slide & Hide Tower for my 2 year old daughter. I just got done assembling it and I have to say one thing. I read the reviews about how hard or easy it was to put this thing togother and I was very nervous about putting it togother by myself. I am a 30 year old woman that assembled it on my back patio with my 12 year old daughter while my husband was at work and my little one was napping....using no tools. Done in less than 20 minutes! Simple! USE LOTS OF LIQUID DISHSOAP IN THE JOINTS! There is no possible way that anyone should have any issues with assembly. Feel confident when purchasing. Great quality. I cannot wait for my little one to wake up and try out her new slide!
4,Defective at first - read if you have trouble putting together,"This climber is awesome, the kids love it, not only mine but all of the neighborhood ones too. My 1 year old was climbing through the tunnel before we even put it on the tower. The only glitch was putting together. 4 grown men were trying to get these walls to get together. They just kept coming apart. We took it back, rather than spend 3 hours and use a screwdriver, like some of the previous reviewers. We also spoke to Little Tikes. They suggested taking it back, as the notches and holes just would not stay together. If it is difficult, take it back, the new one went together with no trouble! A one man/woman job if the pieces are not messed up like our first one was."
5,Can't stop listening to this,"Ever since I met Wendy Pate in 2000 and she told me about her work with the Flat Irons, I haven't let this CD out of sight - over 8 years later. I play it very often. I've ripped it onto my PC for playing and backed it up so I will never lose this music. There's so much to love about this CD: her voice, the range of musical styles played and sung, the wonderful original lyrics and arrangements of existing songs, Rich's drum work, and Jason's guitar playing. It has a bit of everything with a rich new perspective expressed from a heart of love for the music they play."
5,stunning vocals - a real gem,"This is one of those wonderful finds that any fan of great pop music should not miss. The Flatirons are accomplished, nuanced players and this record bears none of the sloppy Replacements/Whiskeytown vibe that dominates the alt.country ""No Depression"" camp that this record is likely to get lumped in with. This debut incorporates traditional country, blues, even jazz styles in a generally beautiful but somewhat dark sound. very cool, subtle guitar sounds. this record should appeal to fans of everyone from Emmylou Harris and Lucinda Williams to the Cowboy Junkies. the best thing here is Wendy Pate's big time vocals - her voice will grab you by the throat and not let go."
2,Hardy Boys,"Boring, It has two disk for each of them and the beginning is exactly the same on each of them. Tells about their life and their beginning. Kind of interesting but fast foward through half of it becasue it was the same stuff."
4,I doubt anyone will ever read this,"So I'll make it brief. This is a hidden gem of the late 90's, and it contains the Holy Grail: Dead Man Walking. David Bowies acoustic version of a techno experiment is quite possibly the most chillingly beautiful song ever written by the Glam God of Rock and Roll. In addition ""Do Ya"" is awesome as is Edwyn Collin's ""Girl Like You"". Mostly every track is enjoyable."
5,Conan can make a good live CD,"I initially heard of this album while watching Conan's show, and I had to get it. Unfortuanatley, everywhere I went to get it, they did not carry it. This CD has a varied amount of musical styles from Artists such as, David Bowie and Ani Difranco. I give the Live from 6A: Late Night with Conan O'Brien CD a 5 star rating"
5,Vintage shape come to life!,"These are perfect. I bought these for my husband for one of his favorite desserts, root beer floats. The size is right, the crystal is attractive, goes with any style of dinnerware."
4,A very good cavalry western,"I agree with the previous raters. This is a good, authentic looking film. Generally I do not like older films related to fights with indians, because quite often indians are savage enemies. They sure were that from the pont of the whites, but I always remember the great injustices they have experienced. Often I hope they win. Here they are nameless adversaries, but one accepts it here. Surely the cavarly felt that way and fighting was their job. The soldiers are common people and not ordinary heroes. The indians are much more heroic. McCrea is excellent in his hard, indian-hating role. Other actors are good, too. This film was made in beautiful, natural mountain areas, which is an added bonus. This is nearly five star film."
2,It got the job done.,"The 1/2"" drive pieces would not accept my ratchet. I ended up knocking the pin out of them and using another socket to drive the bit."
5,Breathtaking stories.,"I waited 2 weeks to get my copy here in Australia but it was worth the wait. This is an amazing book.Being a firefighter made me interested in this story but I couldn't have imagined how real this book made things for me and being a firefighter made it more real because I know on some levels what the guys must of felt. This book is as close as you could get to actually being there and it makes you think long and hard what you would do in the same situation,a must read for those who want to know what really went on on that terrible day."
4,Compelling reading,"I read Dennis Smith's Engine Company book years ago when I lived in New York and enjoyed it. Typically I do not read this type of book but remembered the author from his previous work and decided to 'take a flyer'.When I got home I started flipping through the pages to see how well it would read. That night, I put the book down I was reading and started this one.It's compelling reading. It's sad reading. It will bring tears to your eyes. It will make you proud to be an American. I'll be surprised if you don't feel the same...."
5,Wonderful Book,"Ground Zero by Dennis Smith is an excellent book on the stories from the firefighters,paramedics and police force. It shows their heart and courage. I would definitely recommend it and I would read it over again."
3,"Good heat, moist pad overrated",The heating pad works great. It heats up quickly and stays hot. The moist pad for the heating pad isn't much more than a small sponge. I wouldn't buy this one just for the moist heat. A wet washrag would work just as well.
3,A little weak.,"This product is ok at best. It doesn't seem to keep consistent heat. We bought two of them. One for my wife, one for the cat. We have an older cat that sleeps in the garage because she refuses to come in the house. It's been a cold Winter. No complaints from the cat."
3,it's okay,"the cover has a plasticy feel which I don't like, so you might wanna get a cotton pillow cover for it. also wish it was a bit hooter when on HIGH"
3,110v only,Beware...it supports only 110v sockets. Now I have to buy 220 to 110v step down converter which cost more than this pad. Don't understand we it can be done 220/110 like other electronics. Remote control on it is quite bulky to accommodate converter.
5,excellent product,"Does not have the annoying auto cutoff. Even heat, The settings reflect what one would expect from low, medium and high. Great value for a heating pad. Right price. I bought four and am glad I did."
5,Nice and old fashioned,This heating pad is great. It doesnt have the auto shut-off which is what I was looking for. It seems to heat up then cool down then heat up again which is fine for me.
2,new one every year,"I've owned several of these, and they always need to be replaced after about a year. Generally I retire them when the heating element goes out of control and starts overheating to the point of burning. The slow decline takes several months. First one of the 3 heat levels will stop working, and I will only be able to operate it on the other two levels, and finally I'll only be able to operate it on the last (highest and hottest) level. Then I will notice it getting WAY too hot for comfort. The pad becomes a burned color. A minor but consistent irritant also is that the cover is very skimpy, needlessly so, and his held on by a very feeble snap. The cover immediately falls off every time I use it. I recommend this product for a flame-resistant immobile person."
2,Stiff and crappy,"This is too stiff and the cover doesn't stay on properly. It functions as a heating pad, but there are others that are much more comfortable. This one is so stiff that it doesn't lay on the body very well."
1,Oct 2011 -- DOES Have Auto Shut-Off :-(,"I never tried the heating pad and thus can't speak to its various settings, speed of heating, consistency, etc. I have no idea. I had to return the item because it would not be useful to me with the automatic 2-hour shut off feature. This feature wasn't listed in the item description, and several reviewers had mentioned that they were glad to find a pad without it, but as of Oct 2011, at least the one I received does come with it. Bummer!"
1,Barely warm,"Never really gets hot, just stays a bit warm, not a good purchase for someone looking to remedy aches and pains. Past heating pads I've used were much more reliable at producing heat."
4,"Works well on the low setting, doesn't get hot on highest setting","Mainly this heating pad is a great deal, a bargain. It's not as good as many other heating pads but will do the job in a pinch. It has 3 heat settings and works especially well on the low setting. I've had it on all night a couple times on the low setting. The highest setting does not get it hot. It's never hot, just a little warm.This is a discount heating pad. It doesn't mold well to the contour of one's body. It's stiff but bends, doesn't roll up against anything. It doesn't drape around one's shoulders, for example. It's too stiff.I can't say this is the only heating pad you'll need or want."
2,Not worth it.,"I was not expecting much from a heating pad with such a low price, but this heating pad is worthless unless on high. The medium setting is barely warm to the touch. I bought this product to help after a day of work without spending too much, but the phrase, ""you get what you pay for"", unfortunately falls into this category. I would buy with caution."
5,Girlfriend loves it!,"Bought this for my girlfriend as she has back pains a lot of the time. She loves it and uses it all the time, just wishes she had the bigger size now! ;)"
4,I like it,"I wanted one without a timer. I also like how the low setting is lower than my old one of another brand. My old one gets way too hot. The control switch could be better. My old one has a sweep dial for the low, med, and high. I can feel around in the dark while half asleep and click to any position feeling a more positive click. The thin foam on this Sunbeam between the cover on one side is supposed to be the moist heat. I guess it works, it feels OK. I'm going to order another one to leave at another location when traveling to Mom's."
5,Better than expected,"I needed an electric heating pad that I could take with me on our travels and cruises. When reading the reviews on this one I was a little dubious about buying it because so many said that it didn't really get that hot. I found that to not be the case. On High it gets very hot and even on Medium it heats up to borderline uncomfortable. For me this turned out to be a great purchase. It works very well, is inexpensive, light weight and takes up very little room in a suitcase. No complaints thus far. I've only had it a short while so don't know how long it will last but for now I'd definitely recommend this if you need an electric heating pad."
4,Great for the winter,"I had always wanted one, as I had a heating pad as a young girl, but had not thought of replacing. Well, unless the dogs are laying on the bed too it can get cold in our house at times and this does the trick. King size and was less than 20 dollars!"
4,Sunbeam Moist/Dry Heating Pad,"This is your basic Sunbeam heating pad with a 1/2 inch thick foam pad for moisture and a cover so thin you can see through it. The cover has only one securing snap, which allows it to slide off easily. The switch doesnt shut off automatically Those are the cons.My pros are it is a good quality heating pad with a long company history. For moist heat, I just use a damp towel wrapped around the pad. This serves a double purpose, It helps hold the heat in the pad and it provides moist heat. And for the price I paid, it was a steal."
3,Smaller Heating Pad,"Be sure you check the size of this, you won't be able to fit the width of your back on it. This is better for a specific spot that giving you trouble, not a large area. The controller doesn't look cheap and the heat output is ok, it doesn't get super hot so if you like that you should get a different kind."
3,The heating pad works.,"You pay for what you get. The pad didn't heat up as fast as I imagined (after reading other people's reviews). However, it does the job. It keeps me warm during the night. The blue case that comes with the warming pad (the one you see in the picture) is of the crappiest quality cloth you can find. You know those disposable pillow cases or head rests you see on planes? ... It's kind of that quality...just more closely knitted.It does what I ordered it for. For that I am happy :) ... I recommend you guys put it in your own pillow case for a more comfortable feel!"
2,Not real happy.,"Bought 2, and both crinkle up so bad and do not hold thier shape. They do not automatically shut themselves off after awhile either."
3,Doesn't get real hot.,"I have another Sunbeam heating pad that looks very much like this one and is many years old. I wanted a second one because hubby and I are very arthritic and fight over it. Anyway- this one doesn't get very hot. It gets really hot right away, but does not maintain that level of heat. I don't know if they just dont make them like that any more of if it's because this item was only $13 (sometimes you get what you pay for).Thoughts?Decent product, warms up right away -just doesn't stay as hot as I'd like it to."
2,"""MOIST HEAT A MISNOMER","After soaking the sponge insert, you must wring out the ""excess"" water and thenplace it behind the cloth cover. The amount of heat generated is negligible -you can generate more heat by blowing on the affected body part.An other shortcoming is the fact that the unit ""turns down"" for a while losingheat.The best way to achieve moist heat is to put a heavy wet towelette intoa microwave and then apply it to the body part. You can also wrap a water -soaked towel around a hot water bottle for the same effect."
4,Pretty good for the price,"I replaced my 20+ year old heating pad with this one. It heats up quickly and works well. My only complaint is they don't make things like they used to. The pad itself is much thinner and has a tendency to curl up or roll on the edges. Other than that, I am satisfied."
2,It is okay not very good....,I have purchased this heating pad for my knee joint. But it is not working satisfactorily. The reasons are as follows:1-it does not get worm enough even if you set it to its maximum limit.2- It does not maintain the temperature for long time ( not even constantly for 5 min..!!).3- you cant tie it around the affected area as it does not have any provision to do so.i am not very satisfied !
3,"works fine, but has an auto-off function","This heating pad seems to work fine, but it has a 2-hour automatic shutoff that can't be disabled. I needed one with that feature, so ended up returning this product. Here's one I found without automatic shutoff if you're in the same boat:[..]"
2,Inconsistant heat and a strange smell,"Like many of the other reviewers, I found that this heating pad only stays hot for about 3 minutes before the heat automatically turns itself down. The only thing I could do was turn it off and then on again, but I never felt like it got as hot as the first time.Also, it has a really strong plastic-y smell that rubs off on whatever you've been using the pad on - in my case, my wrist/arm. This is going back!"
5,Excellent,"Excellent item. I use it to sprout some seeds, and for some back pains. Even on the low setting it's pretty damn hot, Highly recommended."
2,a good heating pad - with no automatic shut off,"This heating pad does what a heating pad is supposed to do. However, I was really surprised that it doesn't have automatic shut off! i have a really similar one (I thought I was buying an identical one) that does shut off. This is especially disappointing because my husband likes to have it on his back in bed, and he wakes up covered in sweat (I realize the directions probably say not to sleep with it on, but surely lots of people do this). I would recommend spending a few dollars more for one with automatic shut off."
4,Good,I don't understand the small percentage of low ratings on this. This is just a standard heating pad. No problems. Just fine.
4,In line with what the company promises.,"This is just as the company described. As long as you use the proper settings, this heats up to the right temp, heats up fast and stays hot for a long time. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because a 5 star product would have an auto shut off feature. Also the pad you use to make it moist is kind of lame. It's small and flimsy so it doesn't work wonderfully even though it does work. All in all though, for the price, this is a very good product."
4,Good Quality!,Worth your money especially if you are looking for easy to use and simple to work with! Great quality for your money!
5,Perfect Heating Pad,This product works great and heats up fast. Be careful not to choose a high setting for very long as it can burn you.
3,Decent Product - Would Recommend Something Else,"Works great at first - especially for the price. After using a bit, it stopped getting as hot as it used it. Now it takes unplugging and replugging or turning off and on to make it work.It's nice if you rarely use it; if it's something you use often, I would recommend spending the extra few dollars on something that will last longer."
2,Not that great!,This heating pad does not get warm enough. I have another one that on low gets warmer than this pad. I am not impressed at all.
5,Heating Pad,It was difficult to find a heating pad that did not shut off after 2 hours so I searched the web for one and was very pleased when I found this merchant...the cost was reasonable also.
3,Not what I expected,I have another one of these heating pads and was expecting to get the same one. What I got was not the same as what the image shows. It is a slightly different kind and smaller than my other one. I kept it because it works but I wish the picture wasn't deceiving.
1,received wrong model,"ordered 731-500 moist/dry heat.received 756-5 no moist heat option, no sponge.i'm keeping it because i'm lazy, price was only $13.11 and also had to rip package to open it."
3,heating pad,I find this product okay for the price I paid. It is somewhat limited and I would have gotten an up-grade after seeing and using the pad. I guess you get what you pay for!
3,A century of spiritual thought,"An easy and enjoyable collection of thoughts from throughout the decades of the 20th Century. Particularly well done are the divisions within each decade, beginning with an overview of the historic context then followed by ""Enduring Moments"" frequently from an historic perspective and finally the ""Voices"" themselves presenting spiritual thoughts within the context of the time.A nice ""gift"" book for one who likes to glean short thoughts from the greater context."
5,A MUST for Baseball Lovers,"If you love baseball, this CD can't help but make you feel good all over. I'm sure you'll listen to it many times, BUT be sure to listen closely to the words! Cashman's love of baseball, its colorful players and memorable events from the 40's onward are communicated with feeling and passion thru his music and verse. Buy the CD and ""pass it on"" to your children and grandchildren who enjoy the game."
4,A must for baby boomer baseballers,"I have listened to this cd endlessly since purchase. Younger people will not like the music or lyrics - it is definitely for 40 year olds and older. Very nostalgic and inspiring. Again, good lyrics but only for baby boomer die hard baseball fans."
3,Need more old radio broadcast play-by-play,"This is a good Cd but it needs some old radio Broadcast from when Baseball was still played for the love of the game when guys like Mays,MCcovey and Mantle were considered Heroes by many all over the country and guys like Vin Scully,Russ Hodges,and Mel Allen set the sceen of the ball game with words like ""TELL IT BYE BYE BABY"" or ""HOW ABOUT THAT""."
1,Very disappointing,"I love both baseball and music. The baseball part of this is fine, and the ballads tell stories from my era. But the music is pretty terrbile. Not a hummable tune in the bunch. I had hoped something on this as background for a little family video I was making on softball, but anything from this CD would have just drug it down."
1,Not what you would expect,"I was hoping for a good CD with baseball tunes. Yes, the songs are about baseball. However, the singing and music is awful. Certainly not what I expected."
3,Too cumbersome,"I bought this supersoaker primarily for its shock value. It has a nice big tank (101 oz.) and it makes you feel like Jesse Ventura in Predator.However, the big tank has a major downside: it takes forever to charge it up. By the time I get it pumped up completely I am usually ambushed and soaked with the much more nimble (and I believe much better)Super Soaker Max Infusion Flash Flood. Once you've exhausted about half the volume it has a major weak stream and it is impossible to pump it up completely.On the positive side, it is one of the few Super Soakers with a strap (wish the cheaper models had these) and it just looks cool."
3,Super soaker,"This was purchased as a birthday gift for a 12 year old boy. He had a lot of fun with it, but unfortunately, the seams weren't sealed well and it leaked from the get-go. He was still able to enjoy it, but had to be careful to completely empty it before bringing it into the house."
1,Not Even the Whole Concert,I don't know why you're distributing something which is not even the whole 1999 Wiener New Year's Concert. The whole concert has 19 pieces which you can buy it somewhere. Your one is not a good copy.
3,Sounds good for the price.,You have to remember you get what you pay for. I was looking for some cheap subs for my truck so I bought these. They work good for me. They would not be good for someone that was going to run the amp at maximum gain with all bass. I got them just to add a little bass to my truck. They worked. Alan
1,no good,"really a waste of money. My brother purchased one of these subs without my knowledge and now he's regretting it. they're cheap, but u really get what u pay for. Young kids probably buy these subs up so i'm warning you now, if you want to get big bang for your buck go a different way. kicker makes the best subs for someone with a wallet full of dust. a ten inch kicker comp with an adequate amp will rattle the rearview mirror in the car beside you and you can get one of those for 45 dollars. kenwood kfc subs, mtx thunder series subs, are also cheap and will give you a phenomenal sound in comparison to these. Important factors when putting a system together is to know your equipment, get a good box, and an adequate amp and you'll have no complaints. people see ""1200 WATTS"" on a sub or amp and think its good, well i'll tell ya watts mean nothing without quality."
2,Small Pictures,"I was a little disappointed in the book. It was mostly ""character-related"" glasses. The pictures are too small. It's nice that they are in full-color, but I don't want to have to use a magnifying glass to actually see what is on them! The pictures are provided in ""plates."" One example is a 3-5/8"" wide x 1-5/8"" wide plate showing 5 glasses and 6 mugs. For even better perspective, the height of the actual pictures referred to herein range from 1/4"" to 5/8""."
2,What a Disappointment,"As a Joyce Christmas fan, I was very disappointed in this mystery. I echo the thoughts of the previous reviewer. After getting through this contrived, obvious tale, I also thought that the author needed a nice long vacation! I was actually happy I bought this at a used bookstore and did not pay full price."
2,Where's the plot?,"Joyce Christmas must need a vacation...poor plot, a character (Diane Stark) change that's unbelievable, and a ridiculously contrived ending that really doesn't ""end"" anything. Phooey!"
4,A tough book but well worth the struggle,This is a difficult book on the French Revolution. Lynn Hunt is a brilliant historian who takes European intellectual history and fashions it to understand what was going on in the French Revolution. I will guarantee this is a book to be read at least twice because the first time through you will be very overwhelmed (unless you have a very good knowledge in enlightenment philosophers) and you will need time to assess her ideas. The basics include the nation of France was the same dynamic as a family and the roman ace required the restitution of the family in order to make the country whole. Hunt does not take her theory far enough in the end to include Napoleon as the new father in her reconstituted family but otherwise it is a very interesting analysis. This is not a book for beginners but for those studying the French Revolution they may find it useful. Be warned if you see it on your syllabus make sure you leave time to read it several times over.
1,Having trouble sleeping? We've found the answer!,"WARNING: If you are studying the French Revolution check to see if this is a text. If it is, drop the course. The language is overly formal; the documents boring and only partially relevant; and the book layout confusing and annoying. And for the price tag? Very expensive for a sleeping pill."
1,Very Poor Quality!!,"I ordered these for my 4 year old son because I have had such good luck with the durability of boys Columbia sandals in the past (3 pair). I am thoroughly disappointed with these. After just a few days of normal wear the top layer of color on all the blue straps as well as the logos has worn off leaving behind an unattractive gray fuzzy appearance. Some of the stitching started pulling out after only a couple of weeks. Not what I would expect from an almost $40 pair of kids sandals!! In retrospect I should have returned them as soon as the color started to flake off, but unfortunately I am stuck with them now. It will be the last pair of Columbia sandals I buy for him, for sure!"
2,Too hard for kids feet,"I love Columbia products, these were nice looking but a little too hard for my 2yr old. Would not recommend."
5,A Minstrel's Blues,"Perhaps the finest collection yet of a criminally neglected artist's legacy of sensitive, confessional folk. Tim Hardin was a superb writer of pop miniatures, quiet songs about his life and loves that touchingly reflect our own hopes and struggles. Musicianship, taste and integrity are by-words for Hardin. Everyone knows 'If I Were a Carpenter' (here given the definitive reading). But listeners will find equal parts pleasure and revelation in 'If I Knew', one of the most beautiful recordings I have ever heard. Other tracks glitter and gleam - 'Misty Roses', 'Reason to Believe', and 'Hang On To A Dream'.Hardin, who called himself a jazz singer, was so much more than just another folkie. His special gift for rendering with truth and sensitivity the pain and beauty of life is here captured in a special and tasteful set. Perfect Hardin, in fact."
1,This was the worst waste of money ever!,"I can't believe I bought this calendar. Who comes up with these lyrics? I mean, come on. The only lyric that might have been actually misheard by anyone who listens to music could possibly be the title, ""Scuse Me While I Kiss This Guy"". Don't waste your money on this."
2,Old Old Old,"When would it be time for Gavin to finally write a new book with new illustrations? The four were each written on a period of years: 1995 - 1998. My 2001 calendar didn't have many new entries, most of them were from ""He's Got The Whole..."", and a handful from his other books. Think CLEAN humor, people.Could be a definete miss."
4,The summer i shrank my grandmother,"The summer I shrank my grandmother BY: Elvira WoodruffI really enjoyed this book! It is a fiction story about a girl who wishes her grandmother would get younger. Therefore, she creates a potion that she shampoos into her hair. Then her grandmother keeps getting younger and younger until she is almost not born. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a short funny story. I enjoyed this book because it was unpredictable you could never tell what was going to happen next!"
2,Ti-Silc,I liked the other brand I had. Too watery. I use it for a base and liked the feel of the other brand.
4,The Champs Back,"Good to see John Cena back for a title fight.I think there was some good fights dispite what some of the other reviewers say.Probably some of the results were what they were going on about.I never like to see Randy Orton win.Miz and Morrison im sure are there to just plain annoy people,and get up their skin.I don't like Cain fighting Rey Mysterio,i'd rather see Cain taking on someone his own size.Chris Jericho is a favorite of mine,that Y2J sounds familiar somehow,gonna save us Huh?You gotta be dead to be saved,tisk tisk,its the commandments that lead to salvation.I had mixed emotions in that title match,as John Cena is a favorite also."
1,wwe Survivor Series Live Sunday November 23rd on pay per view,The past wwe Survivor Series pay per views have been pretty good but I'm wondering about this year's wwe Survivor Series pay per view because there hasan't been some good matches in the wwe and this year wwe Survivor Series is going to be in my area but I'm not going to go because of all the screaming and other stuff so with that being said my dad and I are going to order a pizza and order it on pay per view but I'm hoping that this years Survivor Series Pay per view will be better than all of the other Survivor Series Pay per view's I hope that a lot of you will find my review very helpful Take care and I wish you all a good rest of October please note that one star isn't my real rating because I haven't seen the card yet.
2,Good Drive - but misses backing up key files!!!,"Install went OK. Drive runs OK. Backup backs up My Documents. However, I use FireFox and ThunderBird. All my favorites, bookmarks, e-mail and address books are in C:\Documents and Settings\Owner\Application Data\Mozilla and Thunderbird. I have chosen these subdirectories to be backed up many times, but Maxtor will not remember these settings. It wipes them all out except for My Documents. So if you want it backed up, be sure it is in My Documents.This is a real violation of trust. I probably should have given it zero stars, but it does seem to work on My Documents."
2,Stopped functioning after 3 months,"Mine stopped functioning after approximately 3 months. Seagate wanted $1400 to recover the data. I took it apart and re-sleeved it, foregoing the warranty exchange. The problem was with the housing.I bought another one figuring the probability of another failure was small and now I have a backup for my backup anyway."
5,Solid,Bought this for my parents....wanted something solid. It is that. If you want a small unit for laptops...do not pick this....but for a backup to a desktop it is great. No problems with setup or use.
1,Doctorow hates the Irish and the Irish dont need him!,"Doctorow must have carried a grudge against the Irish, they are always shown as horribly racist, cruel and stupid, as opposed to the morally, though naive, WASPS and the aspiring Jews and Blacks. Despite the fact that the Irish were also oppressed and led the Labor Movement, they only show up as agents of repression; cops, vicious firemen and the like. Its funny Doctorow tried to capture life at the turn of the century and inherenct racism in this country while espousing hiw own bigotry and ignoring the plight and triumph of Irish, catholics and other ethnic groups besides WASPS, Jews and Blacks. What a crock! The play is even worse for its portrayal of ""Micks""."
5,Ride through history,"This is a bawdy, brilliant, wild ride through history. All the characters are larger than life yet feel tangible and real. Fictional characters mix with historical figures. Doctorow writes in simple prose; the novel is fast-paced and fascinating.I read this novel because I'm going to see the musical next month. I'm glad I did. This is a fantastic account of turn-of-the-century America in all its glory. Doctorow doesn't sugar coat history, but he does make it come alive."
4,Doctorow's portrait of an era,"It's tough to compare Ragtime with Doctorow's other works. There isn't much of a story here in the narrative sense, though 2/3 through the book one sort of happens with Coalhouse Walker. This book is more of a portrait of the times and of a slew of interesting characters, which include both real figures (J.P. Morgan, Henry Ford, Houdini, etc) and imaginary. Doctorow dips into people's lives for a moment then moves on. One of the faults of the book is that many of the interesting vignettes aren't carried out to completion, rather he just moves on. At the center is an unnamed family (they go throughout the book called only Father, Mother, Mother's Younger Brother, sometimes Younger Brother for short, Grandfather, and the son) that is somehow involved in everyone's life. It doesn't have the social/political importance that _The Book of Daniel_ has, nor the compelling story in _Billy Bathgate_ but it is still a great book to read."
4,Good reading--savor the fin de siecle flavors,"In an ""age"", spanning millions of lives and many years, how to capture the sentiment? Doctorow gives one take on the turn of the century. Here, he weaves together technological change, racial turmoil, and the emergence of a robust new American industial empire. Other names and events could have illustrated this era, but I am very happy with the way Doctorow tells the story."
2,Ragtime by E. L. Doctorow,Book is dreary and not my taste at all. Bought it because of a local reading group doing a follow-up with discussion and movie. Seriously doubt I'll finish reading it.
3,Interesting but not compelling,Ragtime has many stories. There are many places that it could have gone that would have been a lot more interesting. It was scattered. It didn't seem to make a real point. It was not as well written as Billy Bathgate and just doesn't pull you in. I finished it because I started. I started it because it was on my shelf (got it at a book swap for cents). But I would not recommend it to my friends.
2,This book is way over-rated!!,"The book was nice. I must admit, but to call it the ""Great American"" novel or even to include it on the list of the century's top 100 books gives it far too much credit than it deserves. I felt as if some one told me a story about people I've never met. The characters were very two-dimensional. His description of media sex symbols was way out of context. Why bring up Maryln Monroe? This is a book about a time long before she was born, written in a period before she was born, supposedly. One review mentions that he/she read the book when they were in the sixth grade. That is about where I would place this on a reading list. It is okay for some one in junior high, but I think that perhaps some one looking for a story with substance best look elsewhere."
3,Or maybe 3 and a half,I didn't enjoy this book until after I'd finished reading it. My first impression was dissatisfaction. But after a bit of pondering I understood all the conflict and change the book represents. I didn't really enjoy the additions of the real characters. It would've been better off without them. And some of the plot did seem rather cliched. But I think it was an interesting read.
2,Historical Fiction or Laborious Diction?,"This book was just not very interesting. A snapshot of American life at the turn of the century, the book starts out promising enough (for 40 or so pages I thought that the narrator was the son, or that there was a twist somewhat like that) but disintegrates into a ridiculous tapestry of nonsense. Two stars, one for Coalhouse Walker, the other for the description of the Morgan Library on Madison and 36th (not too many people know about this place).This is considered literature? It seems as if the book was based on the musical, instead of the other way around."
3,"See the Musical, Skip the Book","I often find a book much better than the movie or play. Not this time. After seeing the Ragtime special on PBS and the play in LA, I looked forward to reading the book. Much to my disappointment, I found the interplay between the 3 stories often artificial. The pages that delt with the dinner between J.P. Morgan and Henry Ford, I found dumb. The issue of Houdini and his mother...I didn't care. One other comment; If this entire book had been made into a movie it would be rated a strong ""R."" I suggest parents read this book first and then decide if it is appropiate for your family."
5,Step into the Ragtime machine!,"This book turned me onto the scope of America's short history, the pervasive hypocrisy of its institutions, and what it means to be an American. May we live in strange times! It's gonna be okay - let's hope!"
2,Ragtime,I saw the musical play. Very good. The book uses language I don't appreciate and isn't required; the shock factor isn't needed.
1,"Ridiculous story, boring characters","If you've never read ""Ragtime,"" allow me to sum up the gist of it for you... Basically the exploits of a rich family in the Gilded Age as random celebrities of the era waft in and out of their lives for no apparent reason. The actual story of the family takes a major back seat to jarring cameos."
2,"Julia P. , Miller Place, NY","The title of this book I read is Ragtime by E.L. Doctorow. This book was way too confusing because there was too much going on at once. One minute its talking about one person and all of a sudden its talking about someone else. Also, I couldn't tell where the dialouge was. The dialouge was not as its own paragraph or even in quotation marks. It was as part of the regular paragraphs as a regular sentence. The book wasn't clear on what happened to the characters. It seemed to me as if they were there one minute and gone the next."
2,Scattered Look at the early 1900's,"Really scattered, connected yet disconnected, overview of life in the early part of the 20th century. Well researched, but did not lead me to care about the characters or what was happening to them.... they don't really grow as people....had to struggle to finish, simply because I was not compelled by the material."
5,ragtime gives an in depth view of the characters that shaped history in a most human and readable form,"E.L. Doctorow is a master of the written word. His stories give a glimpse into a past that most of us only superficially learn about via education or poorly written history. This book makes you see, feel and smell the air of that tumultuous time."
4,Mixed Emotions,"Ragtime is an excellent story once the reader delves in and fully understands Doctorow's messages. True, it is hard to follow with the inconclusive and sketchy character scenes, however by the end when it is completed and all tied together, the book is truly a great work of writing.The themes examined in this book are not as developed as I would like. The author seems not to worry about explaining himself fully, rather cramming as much information as possible together into a couple pages.This story about the era of Ragtime music was particularly intriguing to myself because I am a semi-professional piano player and I have recently discovered the glory of Ragtime.This book is wonderful if you have some time to devote to it and are willing to get thrown into the whirlwind lives of the characters."
5,A rolling voyage through time.,"This book is a rolling voyage over the waves of eras and eons, fossils and nucleotides, chemistry and physics. The story sways with a rhythm that is both soothing and stimulating. On the voyage we are taught how life may have begun, how it evolved, how it changed it's environment -- indeed how it changed the entire planet. We see how slowly life moved at first, and how it suddenly accellerated to its current frenzy. The author, our ready guide throughout this voyage, culminates the trip with perhaps the most profound and moving epilog I have ever read in a book of this kind. Well done. Accessible. Fun. Instructive. Powerful."
4,A brilliant discussion on the ALH-84001 scientific debate,"Apart from offering his great scientific expertise, Andrew Knoll provides a very through view of the evolutionary tracks that life has followed on our planet. However, what in my view what this book deserves praise for is the brief yet highly valuable discussion he provides on the debate of the meteorite ALH-84001. Not taking any of the debates sides he offers the reader an open minded and brilliant exposure of the subject cleaning up the many misconceptions put forth. In addition I truly liked his brief but to the point treatment of the very painful subject of Intelligent Design versus Science. These two chapters of the book are definitely worth reading.-Ihrenes 2006."
4,Excellent introduction to early earth geology,Well written and complete. Could have used a glossery.
3,Not for the novice,"Very deep reading material, for me anyway. What I could understand was quite good. It did make me realize just how much ecology is involved in the evolutionary process. If you are a second year college student in earth science you might want to read this. The illustrations and photos were very helpful, when I could find out which ones the author was talking about."
5,Fabulous overview of 1930's territory music scene,"This CD is by far the best compilation of music from the black territory bands of the southwestern United States during the Depression years.These bands toured on the back roads of Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, and Arkansas and played mostly one-night stops at local taverns and dance halls in colored neighborhoods during the 1930's and early 1940's.Many of Kansas City's bands went on to fame and fortune, and Count Basie was probably the most famous of these. Other bandleaders like Ernie Fields found local fame on the Kansas City - Oklahoma City - Dallas circuit, but never made it big nationally.While this CD was conceived by CBS/Sony Entertainment as a companion to Robert Altman's movie ""Kansas City"", it can be thoroughly enjoyed by anyone who is looking for a good collection of swing tunes, or who wants to know more about the roots of the Swing Era in the southwestern United States."
2,Certainly not the 'essential' SLF album,This album advertises itself as the 'essential' SLF album. This is definitely not the case and I speak as one of the band's biggest fans. For one thing it features none of the band's hits (it makes a point of not including any singles). For another only about half the songs here would make any SLF fan's selection of the best album tracks. What is 'Breakout' doing on here? Why have they included songs from the dreadful 'Tinderbox' album? Why so many from 'Now then'? In many cases the album tracks selected are actually the worst on their respective albums (with the exception of the excellent choices from 'Hope Street'). If this is the 'essential' SLF album how come only 4 of these songs ever make it into their live shows? This is not a good introduction to one of the best ever bands. On the plus side it includes good liner notes.
4,A great read for photography buffs!,"I first found this book in the local public library. I liked it so much that I checked it out again and again. I finally decided I had to have a copy! It's easy to read and understand. It makes sense of all kinds of photo terminology, and if you want to develop your own film or sell stock photography, get this book. Both are covered in detail. A great book!"
4,Finger Cots as microphone covers,We are using these products to cover the small microphone on headsets. We have to share headsets so we wanted a way to keep the mic as hypoallergenic as possible and these ROCK!
5,La politica materialista de EE.UU. en el s.XX,"Es un libro de historia, muy bien documentado.El autor presenta la politica de EE.UU. durante el s. XX, analizando una docena de intervenciones militares en el extranjero. En ellas el Coloso del Norte aplica su poder politico y militar para expandir su territorio y su imperio politico. El Tio Sam sigue la ideologia del ""Destino Manifiesto"". Asi, enmascarado de falsa filantropia, se convierte en la unica superpotencia politica y militar de nuestro mundo.El autor le pide centenares de veces a esta moderna Ninive que se arrepienta de su pecado."
4,Good book only somewhat outdated,This book is an exellent reference and good info book. it has tons of info about MODE X (somewhat outdated) 3d stuff and optimizing. but at the beginning of the IA 64 age this book is quite old in optimization tricks.... The 3D part whoever about poly and calculus is not. it easy to read and the examples support the book very well a real recommendation if your new to this but you know your programming way.
1,Good Piece Of Written History ...,"I learned a lot from Michaels Articles, but this book is just a recycled version of thos articles.ModeX is outdated for a long time. (On most modern OSs you can't even switch to it.) Innerloop-Optimization is fun, but in a multitasking/user-environment the gains aren't that big anymore.There was nothing new to learn in this book. Except ... how to make money from the same stuff again and again. Which seems to be the way of ""modern"" game-developers.It looks great in the bookshelf and I like the ""you really understand this""-face when guests browse through it. But I wouldn't buy it again."
5,10 out of 5 stars!!!,"This is a wonderfully interesting book that goes deep into not only the hard code of optimization but also the abstract concepts of it. The first 30 chapters are spent explaining that asm should be used only as a last resort since most C/C++ compilers generate generally fast code. Abrash explains that choosing the right algorithom can have a more profound effect on a programs speed than how it is coded. All in all, the information itself is going out of date, but the concepts and ideas that Abrash presents will still be worth knowing and understanding for decades to come. This book is a great reminder that it is good to step back and think outside the box."
2,Where's the beef?,"I would prefer a more traditional text book that introduces the material in a logical and organized manner. Once the material is presented and explained, then worry about the questions and answers.This book dives right into the questions and gives brief background information but it's so disjointed that it's hard to synthesize. And sometimes his explanations are slightly demeaning (see his explanation for question G5C15 on page 132)There is a temptation with this book to memorize and regurgitate on test day.I don't think my 'dream book' exists so plow through this one and you'll pass the test."
2,Not much better than reading the question pool,"This book is just a collection of the Element 3 questions. reorganized. It has 'explanatory' information, but the poor writing and inconsistent use of terms actually confue more than clarify. I suppose someone familiar with the subject might not find it confusing, but then they don't need the book. This was my first attempt to find a study guide. I'm still looking!"
3,General Class Amateur Radio Element 3 FCC License Preparation,The book has some good tips for remembering some of the questions related to the test and has the complete question pool. I tend to learn better with the explanation of theory and process followed by questions. I was able to pass the exam without problem but much of it was by rote memory of the questions rather than an understanding of the principles.
3,I much preferred the ARRL books,I bought this book to take my General exam AND TEch on the same day. I had the ARRL book for Tech and this book for the General. I felt like the ARRL book was better laid out. It was larger and had better content. I felt like I learned more from the ARRL version. That being said I passed both my tech and general on the same day so the results were just as good.
2,OUCH!,"I am a major fan of the Jerky Boys. That said, listening to this CD was painful, especially when one is aware just how clever and funny the duo can be.The thought that kept running through my head was ""Are these the bits that wound up on the editing floor of the first three CDs?""Many of the calls are really mean spirited and humorless(especially the Jeapordy bit). Other calls just seem to ramble and go nowhere. This is not vintage Jerky Boys.The one redeeming bit on this album is Sol Rosenberg's phone call in an attempt to banish Howard Stern from the airwaves... only problem is he calls the Food and Drug Administration, thinking they could assist him with such his troubles.I thoroughly enjoyed the first three Jerky Boys releases. Jerky Boys 4? Forget about it!"
2,Getting OLD??,"I've been a Jerky Boy's fan since the ""Bootleg"" days..The ""4"" is OK, but not nearly of the calibre of the good <<OLD>> days!It's good for a couple of laughs, but certainly not worth the money..."
1,"Have The Jerky Boys lost ""it"" ?","I bought this CD after listening to their excellent 3rd album, since this was the one that I still hadn't listened to. Well, I can say that this is a disgrace to and otherwise classic seris of hilarious CDs.There simply weren't any belly laughs to be found in this CD, only a few giggles here and there. Even classic characters like Sol Rosenberg and Frank Rizzo disappointed me. The only call that actually makes me laugh is ""Trains"" with Jocko's ""flesh tunnel"". Other than that, you won't find the brilliant humor that was a trademark of the Jerky Boys. It almost seems like they're trying too hard to be funny rather than letting the funny stuff come naturally. This is inexcusable. Get The Jerky Boys 1-3 and leave this crap on the shelf !"
3,The classics with pictures,"This book presents the colourful development of the family motor car through the ages - from the heavy, primitive, noisy and totally unreliable machines of yesterday, to the silent, comfortable, fluid and streamlined models of today. It describes: Gugnot, Murdock, Benz, Daimler. The Pioneers who made the car practicable. Austin, Nuffield, Ford, Citroen. The men who produced cars for the million. Cadillac, Mercedes, Rolls-Royce. Big, expensive limousines. Mini, Volkswagen, Renault, DAF. Small popular cars. Toyota, Skoda, Volvo, Moskvitch. And many many others."
4,Great but half way through reading,This book is very good but I am only half way through. Some spots was a little slow. I'm still waiting for something to happen. Sharon does a great job of getting you to feel the place and the people. I will add to my review after I finish the book. I'd like to add that Sharon writes amazing books and always witness to us as we read. Love that.
5,Business calssic,The Innovator's Dilemma by Clayton M. Christensen is a must read book for any person interested in keeping their business moving forward or for any person starting a business. Christensen clearly exposes the traps that cause successful companies to stop innovating and succumb to innovative new firms. The material is presented as a series of fascinating case studies with commentary.
2,"Interesting, but not interesting enough.","Well, if you are a horror fan of like Stephen King books you'll most probably LOVE this book. If you are anything but, this book is most definently NOT for you. That is my review."
1,I ordered the hardcopy and I received a useless audio disk which is waste of my money,"I order only hard copies of books and with my order I received 3 books and instead of this book I received an audio disk.Its a waste of my money for shipment, VAT tax 20% which I pay for import, etc. I would never pay for an audio disk of a book!!! I will never shop from Amazon.com again!Maybe this book is good, but I will never know."
5,Powerful evidence for know-it-all mgrs to stop & listen,"This book is one of the best books on my list. Very powerful documented evidence that good managers can actually become victim to being blind in a sense, by ""properly"" avoiding new innovative projects or markets. Loved it."
2,It must have been mistaken identitiy...,"During fourth of july vacation, I had a chsance to see an old college friend, who is a vice president for a large computer hard drive firm... he was showing offf his new Toyota hybrid when we began talking about the market forces, which interfered with large companies responding to the emerging needs and changes in the marketplace.I was fascinated as he explained to me the difficulty of an older company attempting to incorporate new technologies, while maintaining a profit margin necessary to please investors. It was during this explanation, He recommended ""The Inovator's Dilemma"". All I can say is that his verbal synopsis was far m ore interesting than this dry two-hour lecture on CD. I can only surmize that there must be another book by the same name!"
2,Weasel,this is a little wordier than needs to be. I think his point could be simplified and more direct.
5,Compelling,"The author certainly creates a compelling reason to establish an autonomous team in every corporation to research, develop, market products derived from disruptive technologies. What most impressed me was the author's argument that the better the firm the more likely they would fall victim to this problem. So, the bottom line is that companies can chose to ignore the author's conclusion, but even the best won't avoid the perils to the long-term potentials. And your competition, existing today or not, are waiting for your decision!"
3,A Dated Classic,"I read this book years ago. At the time, this simple, well-written book had impact. I just re-read it and find the content feels dated and perhaps simplistic. The book is worth reading but may not change your life."
5,Great book,"I am not sure where I heard about this book, maybe Bloomberg, but it refreshed my memory and reminded me of actions I should take in my business."
5,Sycophants Beware!,Businesses that employ sycophantic practices must adopt a new paradigm in order to subsist. Christensen's logic is inexorably favorable towards the intransignetly individualistics businesses that shun their competior's sycophantic practices. All you sycophants-you blind conformists to societal and business norms- you must beware!
2,Not What I Expected,"This book was as compelling to read as a college quantitative analysis text. If you are interested in a narrative account of the evolution of the information system industry this is probably not the book for you. But if you yearn for those undergrad and post graduate days and nights spent plowing through business case studies, complete with mind bending graphs and mystifying charts, by all means bring this book with you on your summer vacation."
