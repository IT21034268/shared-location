3,The dvd skips midway through the movie. That made me a sad panda :(,"Dvd skipped midway in move, put me in sad panda mode. I'll survive though. I'll push through the sadness and heartbreak."
4,fair adaptation of an awesome novel,"Do yourself a favor and read the novel first. (Trust me, it won't take long...) Once you have the novel under your belt, you will be properly primed for their film interpretation.Translating the world of smell into a novel was difficult enough and SÃ¼skind did an amazing job with that. So for them to convert it into this film... I applaud the effort. They managed to get visceral enough. It's all about the potent imagery, after all."
3,Ending is Utterly Ridiculous,"This movie is simply ok. It is a bit slow going, and to tell you the truth I found my mind wandering in several places in the movie. Yes, the settings are very nice, and you can indeed feel the grit and the poverty of the lowly minions that toil away in servitude within the bowels of the city. What turned me off of this movie was the ending, which completely went into la-la land. I was expecting a much different ending, one where the main character perhaps came to see that his search for the perfect perfume was not worth the lives he took to get it. I'm sure the high-brow folks will mock me, saying the ending was ""artistic"", but I found it to be completely absurd."
3,perfume - the story of a murderer,"the movie was ok,I hear that the book was truly great.... maybe I should have just read it...the main charater was interesting to watch, but, I felt, in the end, that there must have been a lot that either didn't make it into the movie or needed to be told not shown.At the end of the day(movie) I didn't think ""there is two + hours of my life I will never get back"" but if I hadn't seen it I don't think it would be a great loss to my life either."
1,Perfume,"It was painful. Could not recommend it. It offended my sense of smell, did not really get a sense of the murderer's story."
4,Facinating Story,I had read about this movie from the web and thought it would be interesting.Since I like period pieces and have an interest in perfumes I sat rivited watching and listening to the narrative. The main characters life as an orphan and his rise to assistant of a great perfumer kept me wondering if he would get to be famous as such a man..Too bad he was twisted and ignorant on the true nature of the business. He just turned out to be a misguided genius who turned to murder.
2,"It starts good... and then you're left wondering ""what the hell?""","I won't go into too much details. I enjoyed the first hour of the movie, yes, it is sometimes a little gore and disgusting, but it's good.And then, the so-called ending. I was watching the movie and just wondering what was going on, because really, the last 30 minutes are total non-sense. Let me just say, everyone ends up naked (a huge crowd, probably thousands of people) while he murderer is standing, waiting for his execution. And that's not even the worst part of the movie...That movie is awful. The last 30 minutes ruin it all."
1,Bizarre and awful,"Perhaps the most misbegotten film in recent memory, ""Perfume"" veers from period melodrama to ""Silence of the Lambs"" slasher to bad acid trip, with a final detour into a road production of ""Oh Calcutta."" The director seems not to know what kind of film he wants to make, so he allows some usually good actors to flounder around and make fools of themselves. Dustin Hoffman thinks he's remaking ""Hook,"" Alan Rickman thinks he's in a BBC production of ""Emma"" and the women think they're doing a Chanel perfume ad. The lead actor is pretty to look at and has perfected a constipated expression that's supposed to be a dark secret, but every time he opens his mouth he sounds like he's auditioning for ""Oliver"" with a broad Cockney accent that's completely out of place. Nothing in most of the film prepares you for the ending, which is out-and-out laughable. A sad waste of money and a mostly talented cast."
1,Waste of five hours,"Wait, you mean this movie was only 2 and a half hours long? Well it SEEMED like five. What a dud. Stupid story, too long, slow, and dull. I'd give it zero stars if I could."
2,The Worst,"I didn't even make it through the entire movie. All the noted, high caliber actors (Alan Rickman, Dustin Hoffman) couldn't save this stinker.The acting was wonderful, but other than that, this movie was almost a complete waste of time. Not enough thrill to be a thriller but just disgusting enough to not be boring. Perfume is a mish-mash, poorly told story of a sociopath who can smell."
1,What a Waste of Time and Money for This Movie,"This film held you to almost the end. But in typical Hollywood fashion, it had to induce the audience with its rendition of a slam-it-in-your face disgusting scenes.First off, it should not be for sale in regular stores where someone young could accidently pick it up.Secondly, I thought some actors/actresses had better sense then to be in a movie such as this."
1,Less than a 1?,"If I could I would rate this movie less than one. I thought that this was just a really bad movie. I can see why it didn't do well at the theater and I can't even imagine why anybody would even want to see it, yet alone make it into a film. I heard that it was a best seller. I never read the book but I saw the movie and found it to be... STUPID."
3,First two thirds was great...last one third sucked!,"The Capt. had to review this new release....it was touted as a sexy thriller etc....It began very interesting, although the nudity was very tame...and the sex did not exhist. The ending was insane, even by the Capt's tolerant standards for erotic farces....I don't know what to make of this strange film....if you never rent or see it, you are not missing much..."
1,Blech.,"Not worth your time commitment. It is a movie that tries to do what the protagonist's final product tries to do - beguile your senses into believing that you're actually feeling something, when all you're actually experiencing is malodorous murder."
3,"Great series, but questionable quality in this set.","This is one of my favorite anime based on my favorite story of all time. I loved how this story followed the same basic structure as the original, but deviated from the book to form its own identity. Seeing as how the series is pretty hard to find now adays, i decided to buy this dvd set. at first i was in love. my favorite series on 4 dvds. what could go wrong? well, I noticed something. the image has a noticeable blur when compared to what can be found on netflix. It doesn't ruin this amazing anime by any means, but it does take away from the beautiful art. If its because they put 6 episodes on each disc, i'm sure they could have spread it out to 6 discs with 4 episodes each to hold onto the sharper image that would allow the art to shine through.if you're looking for the series to watch and collect then this is a great buy, but remember that sacrifices in image quality had to be made to consolidate 24 episodes onto 4 dvds."
5,Very Good Adaptation/Re-telling of the Original Film,"I REALLY liked this anime a lot, and let me tell you, I am VERY CRITICAL of anime. The reason this was good is because it tells the original classic from the perspective of Alber, the antagonist's son, rather than from the perspective of the count/protagonist. Furthermore, although it does not stick to the original story specifically, where it differs it does so very well to the point where I actually like this version better than the original story. Furthermore, the artwork/animation is AMAZING and the style is totally different from the generic art work you see in all other animes (I can't really describe it, you have to see it for yourself).Unfortunately, it has a couple of scenes with giant mecha fighting (I cannot understand the Japanese obsession with giant mechas, especially in an anime such as this), but the story is so good that I can overlook this.Definitely make it part of your collection if you haven't done so.Strody"
3,Review,"Gankutsuou is a fascinating visual display of computer graphics alongside an anime based story in the year 5000 A.D.. Based off the novel, Gankutsuou takes a whole new direction with the addition of the demonic entity, Gankutsuou, controlling and guiding the Count of Monte Cristo on his quest for vengeance.This was a very interesting show in the first few minutes, combining an odd assortment of identities with the colorful background of royalty within the Parisian community. However, as time passed, I got the feeling that the director took TOO LITERALLY the mood and actions of the novel's protagonists, as it seemed by the end the characters were... a bit different from what Alexander Dumas had intended.Though the entire show had me gripped in, making me feel as though I needed to see the next episode, I admit by the end I was very disappointed with how the entire journey had ended.If you're a fan of the book, you might like this series until you reach the final chapters..."
4,The Count of Monte Cristo with an anime twist,"I love the book, The Count of Monte Cristo. This a twist of anime with ""alien/space"" characters. I only got half way through so far, thought the beginning was a bit slow, but it's getting interesting now."
3,I've watched stranger things.,"My main issue with this show was that i kept thinking i would see a hidden picture in the costumes. the colors were unique though they were also confusing at times, particularly when one is drunk. but hey characters were alright i guess with the exception of the protagonist, someone should have killed him; good to see what Jet did though after Cowboy Bebop. So all in all not bad not great either but not bad."
1,Please for the love of god do NOT waste your time,"I love anime and the Count of Monte Cristo, so hey I thought this would be g good anime. I was completly wrong. I wasted untold hours watching this on Netflix hoping this would get better but it never did. It follows a boy and his friends in a futuristic setting. The plot is very thin and has nothing to do with the original story line. Please before you waste your money on this set rent one disc from netflix."
5,Happy as I can be,I've been very happy with my purchase. My Koolatron kept drinks and snacks very cold with no problem. As other reviewers have already noted you need to power up the unit roughly 12 hours prior to loading it with items you want to keep it cold. This unit is not a refrigerator so if you pack it with items not chilled already in refrigerator then it will be a long time before things get cold.Whether my unit will be reliable long term I cannot say but on my recent use I have used it four days straight without a problem.
1,Junk! Does not work,What a disappointment. We planned on using this cooler when we went on vacation but the thing didn't cool down at all. I plugged it in at the house for 12 hrs to get it cooled down then put some items in it (from the refrigerator) to see if it would keep the items cold. Guess what? It couldn't keep them cool. It barley got down to 65 degrees in the cooler and the house temp was around 78. So I returned it and got a regular cooler for 1/4 of the price.
3,"First Koolatron was defective, 2nd one we have not used yet","Purchased the Koolatron Compact Kooler. Used it for a weekend (worked great)and then it stopped working. The cord that plugs into the car became extremely hot, too hot to handle. Unplugged it and the next time we went to use it, it didn't work. Replaced the fuses several times in the plug and each time we plugged it in, the fuse blew. Contacted Amazon and they sent a new one out right away and we sent the other one back. Have not had the opportunity to use the new one yet. Hopefully it works longer than the first one."
5,Long life,"This is the second Koolatron Compact I have owned and I a hoping to get as much life out of this one as I did the first. I am a truck driver and use the cooler at least 4 days a week for 8 to 12 hours continuously. With that kind of regular use the first one lasted about 6 years, which seems fantastic compared to several other 12V items I have used over the years. I have had this one for about a month and it is working great.As others have said, this is not a refrigerator. It cools the stuff inside to about 40 degrees less than the outside temperature. So on days when it is 95, I stick a blue ice pack in for a bit more chill. Everything must be cold going in and you can't leave the lid open for long spells. That said, this cooler operates just as advertised and does so for years. I highly recommend this."
4,Quite Pleased,"I am a recently diagnosed Type II diabetic and am trying to behave myself in regards to eating - something rather difficult to do on a long road trip. I purchased the Koolatron 18 Quart in the interest of hauling with me yogurt, cottage cheese, fruit and other things people should not have to eat. I have found that this little rig works like a charm, keeping everything very cool. It is relatively quiet, too. The 18 quart version is rather modest sized, i.e., you can't keep a weeks worth of groceries in it, but large enough to store the things I need for a couple of days at a time.My one complaint, as stated in another review, is the A/C adaptor is not included. If one leaves the cooler running off the car battery all night, the battery is dead in the morning. Thus, one must plug it into an A/C outlet overnight. So know that you will need to spend another $35 on an A/C adaptor to have a complete system that works well."
1,Koolatron Compact Kooler,"Let's make it a simple review.Cons:1. It drops temperature by 20 degrees, not 40, unless you test it outdoors in Alaska early Spring.2. no AC power supply with the unit3. razor sharp metal parts inside that will cut your zip-locks or your hand4. cost way more then it is worth5. has no good cover seal6. tips over real easy7. it is noisy and energy inefficientPros:1. It looks good!2. Is designed for people that don't know how to read thermometer.Now you can check 70 other reviews (to date) and make your selection.Yes, it was shipped back. Thank You Amazon for understanding!Nough said."
3,Worked great for about 6 months,"Worked realy great for 6 months, then the power adapter failed. I ordered another but we missed having it on the one trip. All in all a fine product, but keep extra parts on hand if you need to rely on it."
5,VERY COLD,"This cooler will make ice in a metal water bottle, pretty cold. The cord setup is better than other cooolers that i have owned also."
1,Cheaply made and quit working,"My Koolatron P-75 cooler stopped working after 7 uses. When contacted, Koolatron did not want to be bothered with ""my problem"". They refused to answer my 2nd e-mail, basically telling me to send it to be repaired at my expense. Poor quality, poor customer service, poor customer relations."
3,Good enough.,"I used this during the summer and it worked well enough.This cooler is higher priced than some, but doesn't seem better made than the nondescript models on store shelves.For example, the top lid swivels on two little plastic polyps that protrude from each side of the door.These LPPs fit into corresponding notches in the body of the cooler.One of the protruding appendages on my cooler is misshaped and fails to hold, so the door tends to lift off my cooler when opened.The cooler still cools, but the words ""cheap piece of sh...plastic"" flash across my cortex whenever this happens.Still, I guess it's good enough."
5,Great idea!,"This cooler was so handy for our Thanksgiving road trip! Kept food and drinks very cold, and no sloshing of melting ice water! Also worked in our hotel room, and at the football watch party we attended. Very quiet."
4,Kooltron Compact Kooler,"I keep this in the trunk of my car all the time. We have the large size of this cooler and use it on trips -- no messy ice to deal with. We live in a small town so when we go for ""big"" grocery shopping trips it's a 45 minute drive and I usually stop at 2 or 3 places. This little cooler keeps my cool stuff cool while I'm rinning around without taking up the whole trunk."
4,Works well,I use this for keeping my coffee warm while on the road. I will usually get 3 large containers and keep 2 in the cooler using the heat to keep them hot.I noticed that the containers are wet along with the holders I put inside to hold the containers in place. Not sure why it does this but it does keep the coffee hot for several hours even if you unplug it after a half hour.Other than the moister it works like I wanted.
3,"works, not well insulated","This review is for the Koolatron Compact Kooler (Model P20 I think). Checking the [...] site, I noticed they specialize in As Seen On TV exclusives.I used this cooler on a three week road trip. After the trip I think my normal personal size igloo is more practical.The P20 does do a decent job cooling while it is powered. For my use, the problem is that it is such a poorly insulated container. Any $[...] cooler would hold temperature better. This made me use a real cooler with fresh ice every day instead."
1,"Great, until it stops working","We bought this for our family road trips. We got to use it TWICE! The two times we used it, it was great and kept everything inside cool. The third time we went to use it, it was completely dead. We bought all the recommended adaptors and followed the instructions that came with it. Though it worked great two times, it's definately too expensive to only use twice then have to trash. We were very disappointed and are still looking for a good RELIABLE cooler."
1,"Not a ""Cool"" choice","I ordered the Koolatron P20 from Amazon on October 13, 2010 and received it promptly from Ace Photo Digital, their outside source. In the car I noticed no real cooling, so I decided to try it in the house using the A/C adapter, which I also had ordered. The house temperature was 70 degrees. I used a refrigerator thermometer which I placed in the bottom of the cooler. After 21 hours of ""cooling"" the temperature inside the cooler was 63 degrees, nowhere near the advertised 40 degrees below ambient temperature. I didn't expect it to cool to 30 degrees--it is not a refrigerator--but I did expect better than 63. I have returned the cooler for a refund."
5,Does the job!,"I ordered the Koolatron to carry my yogart, protein power drink and insulin on long travels. I commute 32 miles one way to the office and it keeps my lunch fresh. Remember though that your items should be cold already or from the fridge. It definitely does and job and fits nicely in my vehicle."
1,Received Koolatron in 1 DAY BUT WITHOUT AUTO / D/C PLUG!!!!,"I am greatly upset, I received this item within 24 hours of ordering it which was INSANELY fast delivery, however I received it WITHOUT ANY PLUG!!!! I cannot use this item AT ALL. It is marketed/advertised that it comes with an AUTO / D/C plug included to plug in and use in your car, and if you wanted to buy the optional A/C HOUSE plug it was sold seperately. It is supposed to come with the AUTO DC plug, which I am shocked and pisssed off it didn't. I am returning this ASAP and will never order another product from this company ever."
5,Koolatron cooler,"I don't know how this got on my list of things to review. I have never owned one. I do have two other Koolatron coolers, and they are great. One is over 30 years old and still going. I gave this a 5 star rating because Koolatron makes 5 star products."
4,It works!,Yes it does work as it says! Used it for 48 hours and kept it all cold!Perfect for behind a seat of car. Seems worth the price.
4,good but kills battery,i have an extra deep cycle battery that i ran it off of and it drained it in no time so make sure to use it when actually driving
2,Not happy,"Overall, just not happy with this cooler. It's fits very perfectly behind the driver's seat of my SUV. The unit is smaller than the picture presents it. The picture shows 1/2 gallons of milk/juice in the cooler but neglects to tell you that you can't have anything in front of the fan. Therefore, 2 - 1/2 gallons don't fit. The unit is also really loud. I bought this cooler, and car adapter, to transport perishable items for a baby. Only I don't trust that it keeps milk and milk products cold enough. Nothing is ever cold. The temperature feels similar to something sitting in front of a fan. A regular cooler with ice would be better. If you're just storing soda, fine. But I wouldn't use it for longer periods of time with perishable items. Buy an Igloo cooler and lots of ice."
3,Proper 110V AC Adapter,"I bought the AC-15 Adapter to go with the Koolatron Compact Kooler but it does NOT fit--it is too big yet Amazon continues to link this Adapter to this particular Koolatron. It appears that the ""Wagan 5 Amp AC to 12V DC Power Adapter"" is the proper adaptor."
4,Great Product,"The only downside to this cooler, that is perfect for travel, is the exorbitant price increase recently. Up until a month ago, the 110volt adaptor was included in Amazon's price of $110.00 Surely it couldn't have gone up 30% overnight. Shame on you."
5,Take me back to a time before zero tolerance,Turn up the volume and hold on to your roach-clip 'cause this is some good stuff!
4,"excellent, warm liner","Ordered this liner to complete my Joe Rocket Recon Military Spec jacket. Zips in as advertised but does not have a way to secure the sleeves to the jacket. Makes the jacket difficult to remove as the liner sleeves pull out. However, I have used this liner with the jacket in temps as low as 35-40 degrees and it completely blocks the wind and keep me warm. Great product and a nice complement to the Joe Rocket jackets."
3,Joe Racket Jacket Liner,"The liner is functional and folds small . It does not zip into the early versions of Joe Rocket Jackets, but that's OK as I also plan to use it in my "" Cool Tech"" vented jacket. The photo does not show the zippers in front used for attaching to jackets??? With the two half zippers on the front and the center closing zipper it is not something I'd consider wearing alone, it is good a a jacket liner. Its a light windbreaker, the felt liner is thin. I keep it under my seat in storage compartment for when it gets cool, do not know about rain, for that I have rain gear I carry on long trips."
5,Favorite scent,"This is my favorite scent ever! It came in time for Christmas with plenty of time for gift wrapping, too."
1,The worst U2 book ever.,"This book is a farce. Great photographs, but multiple glaring errors in the text made me question the validity of this volume. I would have given this a zero rating if it existed - check out Until The End Of The World, a much better book about the Zoo TV and Zooropa tours, or the more recent U2 Reader for a more well-rounded view of this seminal band."
3,It's an ammo box.,"This isn't top of the line, so don't expect a top of the line product. For the price, it does its job very well, though it does allow quite a bit of noise. If you are looking for a field bag ammo box that won't give you away every time you move, this is not the box for you. Otherwise, you won't be disappointed. Fit and finish is much better than some of the other low-end boxes.This is not weather protected, and should be kept in another container for field use (out of the rain, etc...)."
3,"Use it. But remember, many student comments are way OLD!","PR's ""Guide to the Best Law Schools"" is a valuable, uniqueinformation source for prospective law students. However,although the numerical information may be current, thestudent surveys are rapidly becoming quite dated and shouldbe taken with a grain of salt. For example, the quotesregarding the University of Oregon are now at least threeyears old - an entire generation of law students!Unfortunately, this often results in factual inaccuraciesand significant gaps in reflecting changes at the school,e.g., cutting-edge technology, new law school buildingplans, new programs and courses, and changes in facultycomposition.Bottom line: PR's guide is a decent overview, but untilthey can claim a ""'NEW' 16,500 student ratings,"" take thecomments with a grain of salt. Also, remember that no bookcan replace a first-hand visit to your propsective lawschools."
2,Bar snooze,I was honestly disappointed with the workout. I teach Barre and have been to many classes and found this boring. The exercises were challenging but the teaching was boring.
1,MRC Model Train Railpower 1300,This is the second train controller (different manufactures) I have purchased with the same results. They work for a few days and quit. I can't seam to find one that is not made in China.
4,Decent Power Supply,This PS is working well so far. The potentiometer seems to a bit better than somer others with this design
3,Light knife,"A good price for the knife - paid about 10 on Amazon. But the knife is lighter than what I would have liked from a Vegetable knife. Overall, feels chintzier than I like my knives to be. Probably ok for some light cutting - but cutting a few onions with this is not fun.edit - I have now owned the knife for a few months and feel that I under rated the knife. It is better than it appeared to be and has lasted well. Treat this as a 4 star review review instead of a 3 star review."
3,Good enough,"I think this is a good example of the coastal music of Venezuela with all the African influence that is commonly seen there. However, the few joropos (folk music from the plains) in this CD are not well performed. Overall, it is an OK CD."
3,melvins,"I've been a long time supporter of the Melvins. I like their albums of half 'ambient' stuff usually mixed in with their 'real songs'. Not that the melvins were ever about a lot of money, but maybe it's a bad idea to put out another 'Prick' when single mp3's can be downloaded for free now. Even though I like to support certain bands by buying their cd's instead of burning them and like most Melvin fans, I purchased 'snivlem', this is the first Melvins release that I burned for free, from a friend.Sorry guys but after the covers on 'Crybaby' and 'Electro' and then 'Colossus' I hope your new cd is worth the wait."
1,A waste of time.,"You can read all the bloated, verbose five-star reviews written by people that think they're in on this ""joke"" recording along with the Melvins. They're not. And anyone who says they like listening to this recording is in serious denial. The suckiness of this disc is so huge, so epic, so colossal, that if suckiness produced light, you could see this album from freaking space. Yeah, I consider this disc is a joke--a poor one--and I think back to the good old days when jokes didn't cost you 12 bucks. FOR SHAME, MELVINS!"
1,WORST ALBUM....EVER,This album is a joke. On you.Buy all the Melvins albums...just skip this one.Ever see that Simpsons when Homer rents the Clint Eastwood / Lee Marvin movie that turns out to be a musical about painting a wagon and then Homer ejects the tape straight into the trash can?This is that scene. A true waste of money. If I could find a way to shrink wrap it and return it...hmmm.
3,melvins,"I've been a long time supporter of the Melvins. I like their albums of half 'ambient' stuff usually mixed in with their 'real songs'. Not that the melvins were ever about a lot of money, but maybe it's a bad idea to put out another 'Prick' when single mp3's can be downloaded for free now. Even though I like to support certain bands by buying their cd's instead of burning them, this is the first Melvins release that I burned for free, from a friend. Sorry guys but after the covers on 'Crybaby' and 'Electro' and then 'Colossus'(essentialy Snivlem II), I hope 'Hostile' is worth the wait. Next stop Branson?"
1,"And I thought ""Prick"" was bad . . .",". . . I'm actually pretty... at these guys. If they're going to sell an album of junk noise at full price - with only two minutes of actual music - they could at least seperate the tracks so you don't have to fast forward to it. And when they do start rocking, isn't it just a rehashed tune from ""Bullhead""? I can stomach the lack of seperate tracks in a case like the self-titled album, which absolutely kicks.... But let's face it, Melvins are aging rockstars, and as such, mostly embarassing. The best album they've done in years (""The Crybaby"") was only good because it was made by a bunch of other bands."
5,The Best Melvins Song,"SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW*** If you're a true Melvins fan and know the old cds (ahem*Gluey Porch Treatments*ahem) just buy this and listen to THE WHOLE THING without talking to anyone about it or reading any reviews. You'll be happy you did..................On to the review:..........This album is the ultimate version of EYE FLYS, considered one of the MELVINS most classic songs. Any true fan that listens to the whole album all the way through will love it. When EYE FLYS finally begins, it has been built up so much by the endless noise that preceded it that it truly is colossal. When I first listened to it, I didn't know thats what was gunna happen. I heard the bass line, and was like ""is that what I think it is!?!?!"" and then the drum kicked in and I was on cloud nine.TRUE FANS BUY THIS ALBUM"
1,"Melvins lose it completely. Weird, and a waste of $","Why would a great heavy band repeatedly release strange albums that alienate their core audience? That's a question many Melvins fans will ask themselves after hearing ""Colussus of Destiny"". 59 minutes of noise, basically, without any tune, melody, anything! As much as I love classics, such as ""Ozma"", ""Stoner Witch"", and ""Houdini"", this is total garbage.It was bad enough when they charged full price for the horrible ""Prick"" cd, ""Honky"" was lousy also. Even ""The Maggot"" didn't do much musically. I will never buy another cd of theirs without hearing it first."
5,Love my Cricket Static Free hair brush!,"I had one of these brushes for about 15 years and the handle finally broke. I was excited to find another one on Amazon and ordered it. It is even better than the first one. Love the anti-static feature of these brushes and the non-slip rubber on the handle. It is very dry in Arizona and there is lots of static, so this brush works great."
5,Best Biography of Bruce Lee outside Linda Lee's works,"I am inclined to agree with the other reviewers on the site about the merit of this book. It is very good, rivalling if not surpassing Linda Lee's account of her husband's life. As another reviewer has indicated the reason for this is that Thomas hasn't just recounted the tale of Bruce Lee's life per se but examined in quite some depth the spiritual and psychological motivations which led him to live the way he did. The biography has a special dimension which moves the reader into the actual reality Bruce experienced. I was affected greatly by the empathy Thomas has for Lee, which at times is so compelling, especially in the narration of the events leading up to Lee's death, that I was pressed to tears. There are few books which have such impact."
5,Excellent,This is the best biography of Bruce Lee that I have ever read. It is not a pictorial perspective of the man but gives the most detailed account of his extraordinary life. It is the first book which has documented the relationship between Joe Lewis and Bruce Lee with an example of a kickboxing match (Joe Lewis vs. Greg Baines). Well done.
4,Well Done Biography,This book tries to convey a more human Bruce Lee. It includes his triumphs and his mistakes and allows the reader to judge what kind of man Bruce Lee was. While not everything in this book can be verified as truth Bruce Lee's life is portrayed in a respectful but in my opinion honest manner. I must point out again that the so called facts in this book have not been verified but it what is told here seems to correlate well with what I have been told by meeting and training with people who knew and trained with Bruce. My only complaint is the authors obvious bias for chinese martial arts. He claims to be a Wing Chun Gung Fu student and in certain parts of the book it becomes clear that he feels that this method is superior to others. However this is still a good read and the author is not obnoxious with his opinions
4,A biography worthy of its subject,"This is an extraordinary and compulsively readable work. Thomas is obviously an admirer of Lee, but refrains from hero-worshipping. He is a practising martial artist himself and well-versed in the philosophies behind the fighting arts, which means that he is able to write authoritatively about his subject. I believe that this book furnishes one with admiration, respect and compassion for Bruce Lee and his legacy. I recommend this book with all my heart"
3,Solid biography,"This is far from an official biography. It has not the endorsement of Linda Lee, and it also lacks interviews with some key member of Bruce's life. Also, the excuse given for the total lack of photos was not convincing at all.But you will soon forgive the author for these minor flaws, because once you begin to read this book you will not stop it. Bruce Thomas, a bass player with Elvis Costello's band, writes with passion, but without bias. He tries to be objective all the times, including the ""conspiracy theories"" surrounding Bruce's death.This book has a serius side effect: after reading it, you will not watch ever again the movie DRAGON (1993). Although Jason Scott Lee gave a great performance, it is clear that the movie was a total absurd, it's amazing how Linda Lee gave her support to it."
5,Better improvement.,"I am a 5 year sound tech who is on a tight budget. I planned on making a bass bin to add to my arsenal or speakers. I made a bass bin around this speaker because the Pyle one I had for years was too deep. I mounted it and it kicks. I am only able to run 200 watts and it kicks!!! I love the price and the specs of the speaker. When I first broke it in, It sounded rattly. I was concerned but then realized that my PC volume was left up too high from my other rig. Turned it down and it sounds great. Definitely going to buy another in the far future for another bin.The only thing I didn't like was how it was shipped. It was shipped in the display box and the magnet was scraped up. Glad it still worked."
5,Thank you Andre and Big Boi,"I'm not going to demean this record by trying to write something ""intelligent"" about it. Track for track, a top 5 recording all time. Any genre. Go on an marinate on that for a minute. peace."
5,Best of the best,"I think Outkast is the best rap act of all-time. This album represents the zenith of of their work. On it, we see Big Boi's flow evolve into the smooth and catchy yet relevant offering (check out Skew it on the Bar-B) that he continues to deliver to this day. At the same time, we see Andre at his peak, when he was fully exploring creativity of his sound (see the sweet distortion in his verse on Da art of Storytellin' pt. II) while still snappin' like the best M.C. on the planet (unlike his later experimental singing on The Love Below and Idlewild). If you have jumped on the Outkast bandwagon with the likes of Ms. Jackson or Hey Ya, you should definetly cop this classic (along with 1996's ATLiens and 1993's Southernplayalisticcadillacmuzik) and see how much Outkast has evolved over the past 1.5 decades. Every track is awesome except #11 (Mamacita)."
4,"Hot, but not blazin","Aquemini is definitely a great album, but it ain't nowhere near the best album of the year. It's got 3 songs which are off the hook (Rosa Parks, Skew it, and chonkyfire), and a few more that are definitely tight, but some of it is kinda boring. I don't know, maybe it's just me. Whatever though, this album is still phat, you gotta check it out."
5,BEST OUT OF THE ATL,YO! OUTKAST CAME WITH IT ON THIS ONE. BUT ALL THEIR CD'S ARE BANGING. AND BEING THAT I'M FROM GA I HAVE TO REPRESENT FOR MY BOYS. MUCH LOVE TO THE WHOLE ORGANIZED NOIZE CAMP. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS CD GO AND GET IT. YO! THEY GOT FIVE MICS IN THE SOURCE. BIG MOB
5,PHAT SOUTHERN PLAYAS,I think Aquimeni is a phat follow up to OutKast's two other CD's. GREAT CD FOR THE TRUE HIP HOP FAN!@
5,Only One Song Really Counts...,The only song I really liked on the CD was Rosa Parks but since I could not buy just the single...the CD was worth it!!!
3,A change for Outkast,"After hearing ATLeins and Outkasts phat rhymes I thought Aquemini would be off the hook. Outkast came correct on Rosa Parks, Skew it on the bar-b, da art of storytellin' (part 1) but the rest of the CD wasn't even rap beats Synthezier was George Clinton funk, Da art of storytellin' (part 2) was rock, SpottiOttieDopalcious was a slow love song/story, Liberation was 70's R&B, and Return of the ""G"" and Mamacita was just unispired lyrics. The course for return was ""gangsta, the return, the return, its the return"" dissapointing except for three songs Outkast needs to go back to what made them good."
4,Good Album,Only a few songs I skip over sometimes. This album is well put together. The lyrics are good. beats are good.
3,Pretty Good but not as strong as their FIrst two,I really dug Rosa Parks though I understand about Her name being used&all.Da Art Of Storytellin' was tight as well.and also I dug Synthesizer with The Genius Mind OF George Clinton(Cuz Funk is still My Main FOrte). but overall this Disc Lacks The Grandness of their First one&the Risks of their 2nd one.I Just didn't feel it from start to finish what stands out stands out but the rest fills like filler.still Boi&Dre are Gonna Continue to be Large in The Rap Game For Many Years to come.
4,Original,"I like their style. Big Boi's fast-paced rhymes is excellent and its got a groove to it. The beats are original and bumping. Good tracks: Da Art of Storytelling part 2. Return of The G. Chonkyfire. Half of the tracks are so-so, thats why it gets only 4 star."
5,It will take a lot for Outkast to Outdo this one!,"Outkast really did this one! I recommend this one as a must have. I can listen to this album all the way through...over and over and over again. A lot of people say that their music is only for people from Atlanta and no one else would like it. But that is B--LS--T! I am from New Orleans and I dug it! One thing that I like about the Kast is that they don't stay on the same type level for their albums. The first album was on that gangsta tip, the second album was on another level, and this album here is on yet another level. Hey Outkast keep doing what ya'll are doing! If ya'll keep handling ya'll bizness like ya'll are we will keep buying ya'll music until the end of time. Oh and keep representing that ""Dirty South!"""
5,One of My Favorite CD's,"For once, the ""critics"" recognized something that was really good and let everybody know. It's about time Outkast got that ""other half a mic because that southernplayalisticadillacmuzik was a classic"". Once again Outkast is able to make an excellent album that doesn't focus so much around gangsta sh!# as it does on chillin and life. For about half a year after the cd came out, about the only thing that kept me goin was knowin that I could come home and pop this album into my cd player. And as many times as I have played this album over the past 3 years, I still play it every once in awhile. Just like Outkast's previous albums, this one just never gets old. I know that a lot of people have already heard this album, but if you haven't, or if you've only heard the radio songs, I would suggest getting the album. It is well worth whatever type of investment you make whether it be buying it or burning it. It remains one of favorite cd's of all time."
3,Stick to your Gunz,"Poetic. On some tracks that is. I expected more from one of the best groups in the hip-hop nation. Don't get me wrong, I like it, but Southernplayalistic and ATLiens were better. Word to the artists, keep other rappers out of it and stick to just Big Boi and Andre'. It's a proven formula."
5,this cd has the best hip hop flava with a southern twist .,the cd shows maturity and hardwork.i like the tracks with new flavor on each.the lyrics are intelligent and tight.the tongue is flowin and the rosa parks cut shows much love for the struggle.it's good to see young cats remember how it was.
5,unreal,must buy for any true hip-hopper. I didnt think they could outdo themselves again....I was wrong.
4,the third album,"after the 1st couple of albums by them, i had to get this album! the tracks r slammin! my main favs on this one is ""rosa parks"", ""skew it on da barbee"" and ""west savannah"". this album is a definite must any true fan of Outkast."
5,3rd times a charm,"This IS my favorite Outkast CD, my first listen was kind of like whoa what is that but after a while it sank in that this was somethin totaly diffrent. Each song is filled with such hard hitting lyrics and up tempo beats. Skew it on the Bar-B is a prime example. The beat is jumpin but the lyrics are though provoking ""The common denomnator the nigga numerator/never know who the hater niggas cater to your ego"" Theres a reason this album got 5 mics in the source. Favorite songs are, hmm each one. Liberation stands out as a class as well as Da Art of Storytellin' Part 1 and 2. Slump is a good song about the hustle and buslte life of a hustler."
4,go get it,"outkast once again has mastered what we call rap. forget about benz and rolexs they take it back to the streets. and thats hhow its suposed to be. rosa parks will be sure to get you moving, while Da Art of Storytelling part 1 maybe one of the most underrated songs ever. track 12 it's deep with the horns that just blow ya away. once again a must have but don't go dub it go buy it give'em some props!"
3,I don't understand.......,"Okay, this is an allright album. But only allright! You people are praising it like its the best thing you've ever listened to. Have you guys even heard ATLiens? It's much better than this album. I can only name 4 songs on this cd that I really like and those are Rosa Parks, Skew It On The Bar-B, Da Art Of Storytellin' (Part 1), and Chonkyfire. I just don't understand how this album deserves 5 stars in anyway. So all you others that haven't bought any of their albums yet, GET ATLIENS BEFORE YOU EVER GET THIS CD!"
2,THIS CD IS OK BUT ITS NO RECORD BREAKER,"The new Outkast cd with its backyard beats and laid back style is simply weak. True, the hit single rosa parks has that smooth almost in your face beat but it still can't live up to all the hype that surounds it. so aquemini is simply a disappointing attempt to be different. Still if you are a true fan you will maybe listen to this cd for a week then forget about it."
2,I paid $15 for a single!!,"The only reason I wont sell this CD to a used CD store is because of the joint ""The Art of Storytelling"". I feel that that song is the best hip-hop jam since Tribe Called Quest's ""Find My Way""."
2,I was dissapointed.,"I was never a big fan of Outkast, although I loved all the hits on the album, ""Rosa Parks"", ""Skew It On The Bar-B"", and ""Da Art Of Storytellin'(Part 1)"", and I also like ""Da Art Of Storytellin' (Remix)"". The other tracks were all pure bull except for the beautiful jazzy beginning of ""Liberation"", but as soon as Dre's voice came on, it was ruined. A rap of any kind would ruin the song completely. ""Da Art Of Storytellin'""(Part 2) was waste of time. ""Return Of The 'G'"", was terrible. These guys can rap, but what are those things that make their voices sound funny on ""Liberation""?? I don't like this album, it is very overrated. I'm the first person to give it less than three stars. Outkast is going on tour with Lauryn Hill. They should call it ""the tour of the most overrated cats""."
3,ok,"This was a good cd, but not good enough for a 5 star rating. it can eat my fatty tox. cds that deserve a five are some like jay-z dmx and Noreaga. Not outkast"
5,A Klassik,"OutKast lays down mad phat beats on this, their third, joint. This is most definitely their best one yet. And big shouts to anyone from ATL who helped them make this (Goodie MOb, Witchdoctor...)"
5,Amazing,"This is one of my favourite hip-hop albums - if not the favourite - and I have in excess of 400. Insightful, intelligent, and truly imaginative rap. An amazing album - MUCH stronger than Stankonia, or Speakerboxx/The Love Below. Get it!"
4,It's rare releases like this which truly elevate the genre,"Aquemini is still the rap album that managed to salvage the art form of hip-hop inside my soul. Until then, and pretty much continuously afterwards, most rap releases have been universally devoid of that diverse creative mark that is streaked all over this classic disc. Yes, there are plenty of gangster anthems and typical references to the social norms we hear in most rap, but with Outkast's third release ghetto life has never been presented as intelligently- musically or otherwise."
5,THE BEST HIP HOP GROUP EVER!,"In a nutshell it is now 2008 and I still love listening to every single track on this cd. This cd will never get old to me. I love the fact that Outkast does not try to be like everybody else, they are so creative and very unique with their lyrical styles, beats, and choice of instruments. This is truly a CLASSIC!"
4,"well, really more like 4.5 stars...","This is a really great album and my favorite from Outkast. The title track is one of my all time favorite songs. It has a remarkably mellow, organic feel and simply amazing poetry from Andre 3000. Other key songs are ""Skew It On The Barbie"" with Raekwon turning in a great guest appearance over one of Outkast's most aggressive (at this point in their career) beats, ""The Art Of Storytellin Part 1"" with it's dreamy production and great lyrics, ""West Savannah"" with it's nice blaxploitation bass/horn beat, and the guitar laced closer, ""Chonkyfire."" There's other great songs on here too but I'm not going to bore you. The reason why this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that there are a few weak songs later in the album like ""Mamacita"" and ""Yall Scared."" Still, this is a great album from an always unpredictable and enjoyable group. Check it out."
5,True flavor for your ear,"What is it about the ATL that makes every piece of music from Georgia great. As if the first two albums weren't good enough, Dre', Big Boi and Organized Noise did it again. When you listen to this album it makes you want to re-define what the definition of hip-hop is. This is not a hip-hop album. It has transcended everything hip-hop is supposed to be and still reminded you that these boys are from the Dirty South. They bombard you with positive thoughts and messages and disguised them under phat beats and excellently composed music. Yeah that's right music. This album will be a favorite for anyone tired of hearing artist share samples of the same dusties, repeatedly. There is not a bad song on this album and like the previous two albums, they ended it with a masterpiece. ""Liberation"" might be one of the best songs I have ever heard in my 27 years of living. After Outkast, CeeLo, Ms. Badu and Big Rub come off you still get to here the track play for another 2 minutes."
5,Beyond 5,"After listening to many Hip Hop/Rap albums over the last 10 years, by artists such as Tupac, Common, Bone Thugs -n- Harmony, Ice Cube, etc... I have yet to find an album that as perfectly melds lyrics, beats, and jazzy sounds. The sound is incredible, and even better, the lyrics have true meaning, going beyond the steryotypical ""hoes, money and sex"" lyrics that seem to permutate rap right now. This album is easily a classic, and is a must for any true fan of poetic rap. Buy this album, sit back, and allow the music to soak through you, as you become a convert to the book of outkast."
5,Southern Classic!,"Two of the best that ever did it. Rhyme styles, concepts, beats-this album has them all. While Andre tends to get most of the attention, I think Big Boi is highly underrated. Each member has something different that they brimg to the song. Great Album."
5,Another Classic From The Playa & The Poet,"Once again, OutKast drops another lyrically enhanced, superbly produced album, which goes to show that lighting can strike thrice. I believe that the title of this album defines the whole layout of this album. Dre continues to drop tight thought provoking lyrics, while Big Boi returns to his southernplayalistic style. Also, the production also seems to be a hybrid of ""Southernplayalistic..."" and ""ATLiens"". Tracks like ""Slump"" and ""Da Art Of Storytelling Part 1"" have the feel of ""ATLiens"" while ""West Savannah"" and ""Rosa Parks"" sound reminiscent of the first album. All in all, another banger from OutKast and ONP."
5,Best rap cd of the year,"This cd shows how Outkast grew up, as opposed to their two previous cd's(which both were NO JOKE!) Southernplaya... Was them as young ""G's&quot, and slammin caddilac doors. ATLiens was more of the, well Extra-terrestrial, and Aquimini is just the plain hit! When does the next one come out?"
2,"Good, but I Was Hoping for Better","I recently became a fan of Outkast when I heard ""Stankonia"", so I decided to check out ""Aquemini"". Unfortuantely I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. It's way to mellow and some of the songs are just too long to keep your attention. If you want a good Oukast cd, get ""Stankonia"", not this rushed piece of garbage. And to think that The Source gave it 5 mics...haha."
5,Terrific book!,"I bought this as a gift for my husband to help him identify all the birds that come to the feeder in the garden near our swimming pool. It is an outstanding book, easy to use, and has given us hours of pleasure. Can't imagine why anyone would give this book a bad review! We love it and are thinking of buying a second copy just because ours is getting so worn!"
1,not a real field guide,"This is not a real book, and it is not good for identification purposes. It is simply a ""recipe"" collection of very generic, somewhat outdated ""species accounts"" which are packaged by the state. It is a money making scheme. If you want a field guide, get Sibley, Kaufman, Peterson, American Bird Conservancy... there are so many good ones. Skip this.As another drawback, this uses photography, rather than artwork. Photographs are well-known to be poor for ID purposes. Kaufman is the only photo guide that comes close to usable."
4,Finally a book you can use!,"Well, it is about time a small compact book with full color photos showing male, female, winter and summer plumage was available. Actual bird photos are so much better than a drawing or a black and white shot. So many times, I have seen a strange bird and could not find enough information as to what type it was, now I can.I gave the book a 4 instead of a 5 because the description did not tell where the nests were located, the nesting materials used, nest designs or egg shapes and colors. I found by accident that the Kildeer lay eggs on open ground, are ready to eat and run within a few hours after birth and that the parents carry the broken eggs away from the hatching. This bird lore is very interesting and this type of description should be included for each bird.But overall, a great bird information source and perfect for beginners like me!"
5,Great Book,This book is concise and easy to use. The pictures are good and being able to look up a bird by color is fantastic. It really cuts down on searching time. The colors are even cross referenced. I highly recommend it.
5,So easy to identify birds no matter what age you are!,I purchased this guide because of the good reviews I had read on it. I like that you can look up the birds by color as we are bird novice's and even my young children can look up the birds they see on our feeders and identify them. Great guide all the way around!
2,NOT for Applesauce,"Beware...this item does not do applesauce without breaking your item. I have owned this strainer for over a year. It worked fine for tomatoes (though loud) and then we read you can also do applesauce with it. We strained a large number of apples (3 bushels, cooked) and about 3/4 of the way through the strainer started allowing grease? to come into our sauce. We took it apart and tried to clean it a couple times. The company said it was not meant for applesauce (even though it is advertised to be), so now we have a less than adequate machine as we cannot tell if it is grease or aluminum seeping into our food that we are straining. The parts are not all stainless steel, by the way, mostly aluminum and plastic."
3,The only song I like on this cd is flex.,"If you really want a gooooooooood love making song #7 Flex is the one for you! Your girl, guy or significant other will really enjoy this tight raggae groove!"
5,*****Voivod- The Outer Limits*****,"The Outer Limits is one the best produced theme albums around, truly spectacular. This is by far my favorite Voivod album. It is a tasteful mix of progressive heavy rock with amazing unconventional guitar parts and sounds coupled with very syncopated drumming and stellar vocals. If your are a musician, this is required listening and playing. The album has an alien theme to it which includes a 17:28 masterpiece ""Jack Luminous"" which is loaded with time and tempo changes and out of this world progressions. The album also contains the Pink Floyd cover ""The Nile Song"", which like their other Floyd covers, is an outstanding homage to the song done extremely well and very powerful. The CD comes with 3-D glasses, yes 3-D glasses, and a book of 3-D pictures relating to each song! VERY COOL! Just buy it, look, listen, and enjoy! I rate this album 7 stars out of five stars. This will always be an all time favorite album of mine."
5,Great product at the right price,Used for lead volunteers at a soccer tournament. XL provided extra room for jackets underneath. Would recommend to buyers looking for high visibility
5,Does it's job!,"This vest is more yellow than the picture shows it as, but I'm fine with this. Bright, can be seen well in this vest. I use it for my night bike rides."
3,A bit too small for me,"I ordered the Medium size of these and it does come in a bit smaller. Not obnoxiously small, I can still wear it but it just sits a bit higher at the waist then I would like it too.But it gets the job done as far as visibility. I use it for my bike ride commute at night and it really lights up reflectively when light hits it."
4,Deep insight into the teachings of Tibetan Buddhism,"This book is for anyone who wants great insight into Tibetan Buddhism.For those who were disappointed with introduction books to Buddhism, H.H. Dalai Lama gets in depth into the paths, teachings, and practices in Buddhism.It is a very detailed book and teaches Buddhism in depth and not in an overview fashion. Very insightful and I was able to learn a vast amount of knowledge from reading this book. H.H. Dalai Lama, I feel is an amazing writer and is a source of compassion and knowledge for anyone. If you would like to know more about Buddhism than just an overview and ways to cultivate the wisdom inside of you, I would say this is the book for you."
1,Not good,"I got this book for an online class in Cross-sectional anatomy. Maybe this review is partly my frustration with taking this material online, so take it for what it's worth.The book is nothing but a dry recital of facts. If you are trying to learn the material forget it. If you already know it, then you might find it nice. I don't.The text refers to images that are spread throught several pages (and not the page with the text on it). This is very frustrating. Images are labeled in code, this also frustrating. It would take more space, but I think you could concentrate on an image and explain it, then move onto another image."
1,Too Much To Tackle,"The problem is that the sections are way too big to ever really nail anything down. For example ""Upper extremeties"" (489-566) is 77 pages of reading covering: shoulder, humerus, elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand could have been broken down into smaller chapters. Weekly assignments would have been much better than monthly assignments. It's like shoving a whole 72 ounce Porterhouse steak in your mouth at once and trying to chew it up and swallow it all in one gulp!"
3,Helpful for those learning sectional anatomy,"For some images of the book, the contrast and qaulity of images can be clearer. Otherwise a book book for sectional anatomy learners and as a book of reference."
3,Not the best,"We used this book in x-ray technology school and in preparation for the CT exam. The images are alright, although some of them are not the best quality. Also, by the time you get to the point of learning cross sectional anatomy you should have a deep knowledge of human anatomy, so I really don't see why the writer wasted so much useful space by writing about structure and physiology. I also didn't like the labeling, because instead of using numbers like most books do, they used abbreviations... kind of a give-away if you try to practice."
1,Not happy buying this book,"In my opinion this book is too basic and may be suitable for a newly appointed technologists. For a professional radiologist who would be looking for a dependable book with good crossectional anatomy, it will not be ideal book to buy."
5,Great Service,Product was in excellent condition just like the seller said and I received the item in a timely fashion.
3,The Indian rope trick really does exist,"GuysI have not read this book yet, but I can't resist myself from commenting on this topic.I don't know what kind of research the author has done and arrived at the conclusion that the Indian rope trick was a complete HOAX.The fact is that the Indian Rope Trick does really exist. It's just that very few magicians can do it. The classic Indian rope trick (boy vanishing in thin air and then the master cutting him in to pieces) may be a myth, but the Indian rope trick is very much performed even today.[...].There is an excellent demonstration of the trick in BBC's program supernatural science - Secrets of Levitation where Nishamuddin, a magician from India, who has revived this trick, performs the trick for BBC.There is a professor and a magician in Kerla (southern India) who can also perform this trick.So I don't know what's all this fuss about?"
5,Relationships Gone Awry,"A Place of Acceptance, a story of loving family relationships gone awry, is a powerful novel that not only holds our interest but ties us intimately into a learning experience. We are learning unaware that we are being taught.The characters are portrayed honestly and with tact. How does one handle such a problem? Any such scenario in a family is bound to cause problems especially severe when the members are blind to what is happening. And yet the author walks us through so graciously that we are caught up in the story.We become the jury sifting the facts, even praying about the outcome. The tension builds as we sort the problem ourselves, wondering just how we would handle this if it were our family. The plot is intriguing, honest and down to earth. I would call this book a powerful read, a must read."
3,Too Small for Lunchables with drink >:-(,It can only fit the smallest sized lunchable. The compartment on the bottom is handy. It's an okay lunchbox. I'll probably switch back to the traditional sized lunchbox next year.
5,Priva Premium Hospital Bed In A Bag,"I bought 2 of these sets from Amazon over 8 months ago when my 96 year old mother went into hospice care. The sheets are soft and fit the hospital bed mattress beautifully, even with the pressure pump pad on the bed. They stay put, the corners don't pop off and the design of the top sheet leaves plenty of toe room.They have been washed and dried at least 3 times a week and have really held up well...still look like new and have kept their shape. I am buying another set just so that I won't have to be washing bedding every day.I like the fact that the bottom sheet is trimmed in blue and the top sheet is trimmed in green. Makes it very easy to grab the right sheet when you are changing the bed. All of the CNA's who have come in to care for my mom have commented on how nice these sheets are and have asked where I got them. Definitely a 5 star product!"
3,Thin Sheets,"The quality was poor - very thin sheets. The blanket was nice, a good weight for a hospital bed at home"
5,holiday music that couldn't be better!,"For any that love holiday music, and especially for those that like Orchestra music such as the great Glenn Miller, this is the CD for you. All the great holiday tunes with the special and wornderful touch of swing music by the greatest orchestra. Be sure to include in your purchase...or at least consider them for next time...In the Christmas Mood 2 and In the Nutcracker mood; they are just as wonderful."
5,Wishing You a Big Band Christmas!,"The only thing missing on this collection is the late, great Glenn Miller. Despite that, this is a very authentic sounding effort from original members of the Glenn Miller band. ""Sleigh Ride"" opens this collection. ""We Wish You a Merry Christmas"" is reminiscent of ""Pennsylvania 6-5000"" as ""Aud Lang Syne"" is reminiscent of ""American Patrol"". The Yuletide melodies are fun to listen to and there's an original composition ""In the Christmas Mood"". Then of course, there are selections from Tchaikowsky's ""The Nutcracker"". These are unpretentious and though improvised, respect the original spirit. Considering that most single CD's go for a higher price than this gem, this is a bargain!"
2,"Lame Pseudo ""Swing""","Like the rest of these limp ""Glenn Miller"" albums recorded 40 years after he died this is a lame take on ""swing"" music. It's well recorded but nothing like anything he did when he was alive. Call it ""Glenn Miller lite"", or swing without syncopation. Similar to a Lawrence Welk approach to ""swing music"" albeit more lively. Either way, a misrepresentation of swing music. Pretty dreadful if you are a true swing fan, but lots of folks seem to enjoy this watered down pablum."
5,Woah,"Baby Dc is a grwet rapper and I stand behind him 110% I've known him 4 tha past 8 yrs of my life and all i can say is he is a really great rapper. Be looking out 4 his new album sometime next year and I reccomend Do that dance(say uhh ohh), Bounce rock skate roll, and candy girl. Go check out the album and support my friend."
5,How Coo Is Dat?!?,"This almost-14 yr old boy can rap! Man it's an awsome cd, totally worth it! My favorite song is ""Candy Girl"" which as a more fun pop vibe to it, that song plus ""Bounce Rock Skate Roll"" features his fly friends, Imajin who are a young R&B group, check em out!"
5,Yogiilates is AMAZING & I think the instructor is wonderful,"The instructor who hosts the video, Jonathon Urla, is by far one of the best instructors I've ever seen on a workout video. And, Yogilates is a phenomenal way to get your yoga, stretches, & Pilates done all at once. I always feel like I've done a serious workout after, while also feeling relaxed & renewed. I highly recommend it!"
3,James II attacks his support and loses his throne.,"This book was written in the 1930s and is now coming back as a reprint. With all the revisionist history floating around (Ungrateful Daughters), it is good to read something about why James II did lose his throne. Basically James II was an inept leader who attacked his base of support (Tories) and alienated the Whigs. When William I landed and advanced on London, James II gave up and fled. If he would have stayed, he and his son would have ruled Great Britain with the consent of Parliament. Trevelyan does a good job of detailing how James II lost his throne.This is an academic read. There is little dramatic actions in this book. It is simply an explanation of how a leader should not rule. This is also a short read for someone looking to understand the Glorious Revolution."
4,Not as great as the original but free is an amazing price,"The original Arabian Nights is long and full of various stories. Some bloody and adult rated not suited for children. This is unfortunately not the great original version. It is a sanitized abridged version. Regardless, it still has some great stories in it and for the price of free, I can't complain. If you don't like it, you can always delete it and buy the full version for a few bucks. You have nothing to lose by reading this version. It's like a trial for you to test and if you love it and want to read more [as in the full version] you can buy it.Well worth the price I did not pay! :)"
2,Don't like this translation,"Genie in every other translation becomes Genius in this one. That and similar options make this one hard to read. I like the stories quite a bit, but I don't like this version."
4,Great Stories,"There are a lot of stories in this free e-book. Like Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp, The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor and many many others. I would have given this book five stars if Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves was one of the stories in here."
2,Not the same,"As a child, this was a wonderful mystical idea of a beautiful land and people. Now, I can't get past the current day tragedies of the middle east to enjoy this at all."
5,Great,A wonderful book. Contains so many enchanting stories. It is so delightful to read on a rainy day. Love it.
3,This is considered a classic?,"I'm deeply disappointed in this collection of tales. I've grown up all my life hearing about Scheherazade and her stories, of Aladin, and Sinbad, etc. I had drawn a picture in my mind of great adventures and brave characters. My mental image was much better than reality. The ""heros"" of these tales seem to all be self-serving liars and thieves without honor. I can't even bring myself to finish the book. One day I will, just because I am too stubborn to leave something undone. But for now it will just sit at 48% in my Kindle."
3,The Arabian Nights,"This is a sanitized childrens version of the classic novel made famous many decades ago. It is missing the critical ""adult"" thread of why the stories are being told; the woman telling erotic and exotic stories to the king to entertain him and entice him with wanting to hear more so she may live... Without this element, this merely becomes is a nice collection of fairy tails randomly sited."
2,Abridged Sanitized Version,"This version is missing key events in the main story line, as well as ""less"" important pieces of the story. This version is also toned down for less mature readers as most of the adult pieces of this book are left out. I would recommend reading the full version of the book, which I found for free in the kindle store although it comes in two parts."
3,amputated version,"This version ends abruptly, not at the end of the book, but at the end of one of the (1001) tales. It includes the beginning, but not the end, of the wrap-around story that is the setting for all the other stories. To find out what happens to Scheherazade after she finishes telling all the tales, you have to get a different version. I was so surprized at this, that I thought at first my Kindle was broken and wouldn't go to the next page. In this version, the next page isn't there."
1,editing,"I wanted to reread this, as I had enjoyed it so much as a child. Unfortunately, I found a problem that I am seeing more and more these days. That is the editing. I can't help but wonder if a real, literate person ever reads any of the books published anymore, or if they are just run them through a computer. The word ""genious "" is used instead of the word ""genie"" throughout the book. This is by no means the only such error, but surely for a book titled""The Arabian Nights "" it is the most egregious one."
2,Not really low carb,My problem with this book is the amount of flour is in the recipes. True low-carb should be staying away from flour. Then add her use of no/low fat food is just sickening. There are some good ideas and that is what saved it from getting a 1 star. I would recomend getting The Low-Carb Gourmet: 250 Delicious and Satisfying Recipes by Karen Barnaby (not here on amazon that only has the Hardcover one)
4,Very portable and usable but freezes up easily,"I got this as a sort of ""extra"" frig for drinks in the summer. However, it freezes up easily and can't be adjusted for temperature. It is lightweight and portable, working well for a drink chest for parties.Also, the plug in that comes with it was missing. It only plugs into a car outlet--I had to buy the adapter to use it in the house.Given the choice, I'd probably go with a small refrig that adjusts temperature. However, again, I like the portability of this product."
1,CHEAP,This refrigerator arrived with the door broken off of the hinge. There was NO packaging outside the original box.
1,arrived with the door hinge broken,"The hinge on the door was broken on arrival even though the packaging was not damaged. It seems like the double door concept with the heavy cooler mechanism on the door put a lot of stress on the plastic hinge. Good concept, but poor execution. I had to return it before we could even turn it on...."
4,"The Kargo Kooler works well, but plastic is cheap","I purchased this Kooler for camping trips. I received it intact, but when attempting to open the unit I tried to slide the black clasp and it cracked immediately and would not allow the lid to open. I, finally, had to just pull the black clasp off the unit and now I use the unit leaving the doors facing upward. The interior size is good and served my needs for a 5 day trip. It kept drinks and food items cold even when disconnected from 12v outlet for several hours."
2,?,"I didn't even get a chance to try this cooler. It didn't have a plug to plug in the adaptor. I did ask the company about it and they said they would send it to me no charge, but I didn't want the hassle of dealing with it perhaps being the wrong plug. I needed it in a hurry. It was also bigger than I really wanted."
1,dont try to plug it in at home,product arrives with no plug-in cord. is it just me? shouldn't one be included?
3,Cool but not cold.,"It can be used to keep your beer cold for few hours but it will not make it cold. If you put warm beer in it will not make it nice and cold in few hours.Good for people who don't want to buy ice and have hassle with water all over your car, but it's not as good as I would like. It will not kill your car battery in few hours (at least not on my BMW X3), but I wouldn't try overnight."
5,Great Product!,"I read all the reviews before purchasing. I must assume Koolatron read them too because my product arrived in tact; no hinge or other issues. It works great! I purchased the AC outlet at the same time, and many kudos to all of you who made my buying experience pleasurable. Let's keep writing reviews of our purchases because it really helps. Thanks!"
1,Very disappointing!,"The fridge arrived today and I am sending it back tomorrow - I was so disappointed to open the box and find that the door hinges had gotten completely busted up during shipping! There was absolutely *no* packaging material, just the cardboard box, so it's no surprise the product got so damaged.If you decide to brave the shipping risk, also keep in mind that (1) this really seems like more of a cooler than a fridge, the ""electronic"" component notwithstanding, and (2) you need an AC/DC adapter unless you plan to plug it into the cigarette lighter in your car.The one plus is that it is lightweight... and Amazon has a very fair return policy."
4,Direction of plug makes a difference!,"Be careful to notice in which direction you insert the plug. One direction provides heat, the other cool air. I suffered the loss of some really good food for not knowing that I was warming, not cooling, my food on a 12-hour trip. Other than that, it was wonderful."
4,krush is one kool kat,"I think this cd completely stands on it's own and would be perfect for first time listeners of Krush. Of course nothing will replace the moment I first heard Code 4109 and I do think it should be required listening for any Krush fan. Yet Jaku blows my mind with each repeated listening. He layers his tracks thick with beats and bass and is not afraid to trip us out with time changes and musical codas. ""Decks-athron"" with Dj Tatsuki is stuck in my mp3 player on Repeat. I love that Krush expands our notions of hip hop and rap. He makes me think while he's making me move."
4,A solemn and moving piece of work...,"Never one to repeat himself, Krush is one of the few turntable-ist who continues to challenge himself. This album is a piece of work which carries an atmosphere of ceremony and contemplation. While there are lyricists on this album the musical tone remains in tact throughout. Possibly taking cue from his ""zen"" collab with Kodo drummer Tunde Anyanyemi more traditional Japanese instrumentalists have been brought in as collaborators. It's these collaborations which take center stage. Though some of the songs are relegated to interlude length (such as ""Transition"") they are all the more impacting for it. ""Beyond Raging Waves"" is one of the best hip hop instrumentals ever! It's these ""collaborations for collaborations"" sake that have always seperated DJ Krush from the rest of the pack ten albums + on."
2,yawn...,"I am an avid birder, but I could not finish this book. Perhaps if I were a Brit, it would have more relevance since all the descriptions are of English birds. The descriptions of bird songs through the year are very dry and not particularly interesting. The woodcuts are nice, but hardly a reason to buy this book."
5,Buy now!,"My self being a Praying Mantis practitioner can honestly say this movie RULES! If you like the Mantis Fist, or martial arts period you have to see this movie"
2,Not what I expected...,"I commonly look at the ""listmania"" lists of Amazon users for suggestions on Old School Kung Fu movies that I haven't seen. ""The Thundering Mantis"" showed up on two separate user's lists so I thought it would be worth buying. While it is defintely ""Old School"" with no wire-fu, it is weak on substance. I think they also tried too hard to make it humerous. The main protagonist does not seem nearly talented enough to carry this role. The fight choreography is slow like they are only going half speed. It does not compare to classics like Invincible Pole Fighter, Shaolin vs. Lama, Shaolin and Wu Tang, or The Prodigal Son."
2,Decisions,I've been a fan of Corey's sine the 1980's and it's sad that the last movie he did before he passed away isn't very good.It's not that he's a bad actor it's just he's given lousy scripts to work with.He looks pretty rough in this movie.something in his eyes that maybe indicated his drug use present or past.His character is not very likeable either.It has a twist ending and I appreciate the message it was trying to send but it still couldn't save this movie.
3,Fun book - appeals to women but I don't think the men will mind,"Raykeil has written a fun and very readable book about recapturing her libido after childbirth. I expect that this will interest about 99 percent of the adult population. She outlines how having a baby and facing all of the added chores of parenthood diminished her interest in things 'naughy'. Happily for her husband she set out to do something about it. Happily for us she wrote it down. She gives a funny account of how she introduced playfulness, risk taking, and libidinous time management into her marriage. Good book!"
4,Grab a babysitter and run after your former sex life,"I loved this book! A person really can relate to the character in the book. Many of us just get so overwhelmed with the demands of parenthood that it is impressive how many families actually go on to have more than one child! The book does not offer a clear solution, but it is rather a diary of one woman's journey to revive her sexy self. It ends a bit unresolved, but leaves plenty of possibilities for one's own resolutions."
4,some bonus features,"A 5 star movie with Doris and Rock.This was the film that catapulted Doris Day into superstardom.The humor holds up and the chemistry between the two leads is infectious.There is audio commentary,A new documentary - Back in Bed with Pillow Talk (about 22 min long)Chemistry 101: The Film Duo of Rock Hudson and Doris Day (about 5 min long) and the theatrical trailer.This will make the 4th time that Universal has squeezed my hard earned money to purchase this delightful film...first it was the laserdisc in the mid 90's...then the DVD in 99...then the romance collection in 2004.I am happy to say that this time it will be for a digitally remastered picture and some bonus features.How I wish that there was an audio commentary from Doris herself and outtakes.Maybe on the Blue Ray release?Because these are not included on this release I am giving 4 stars instead of 5"
3,"Good News, Bad News DVD Only Review !!!",Good News: Doris Day and Rock Hudson are great in this Technicolor Comedy.Bad News: This is 2003 and Universal Studios still releases DVD's with false DVD descriptions. They annouce this is a WideScreen Movie Presentation. NOT!!!!!!!!!!!! This is a LetterBox WideScreen Only. Another words you watch this tiny horizontal & vertical black bar pictire in the center of your television. (NOTE: Only true WideScreen is Anamorphic (adjusts automatically to any size TV) WideScreen or Enhanced for 16:9 WideScreen HDTV's). This is not!!! the picture on a 16:9 tv is small and grainy. Not a very enjoyable Home Theater experience.Rent this only or watch it on television. Very disappointing & unexceptable DVD. Skip it!
3,Two's a Crowd on a Party Line,"Doris Day and Rock Hudson are the unwilling sharers of a party line telephone in this classic comedy movie. He's a composer always on the make--and on the phone--while she's an interior decorator with very little interior life. Doris is being courted by wealthy thrice divorced Tony Randall, who just happens to be, unbeknownst to her, the best friend of her phone rival. When Rock finds out, he decides to teach Doris a lesson and have a little fun himself, but like all practical jokes, the plan misfires and he almost ruins his chances for happiness with Doris. A good movie in many ways, but not quite as funny as I remembered it when I rented it again after many years last week. Yet Rock's sham portrayal of a gay Texan is a lot more eyebrow raising today than it was back in 1959, and Tony Randall is really the best thing in the movie with his neurotic pining after Doris."
2,Dated Froth,A predictable pile of doo doo. I can appreciate good acting but the acting has to have a story attached to it. This movie is nothing more then a bunch of stupid scenes with Miss Day at the centre. The story line is so thin it's barely visible. The acting while good really doesn't jell together and one is left wondering just what they are talking about. I guess it's a favorite for fans of old films like my partner is but oh God I had to fight to stay awake to get through it. A flimsy forgettable pile of fluff which sends social progress back to the dark ages. Just plain stupid in my opinion. I can't believe it was that successful when it first was released.
4,Great classic,This is a great classic Doris Day/Rock Hudson movie. Loved it! Although a bit campy by today's standards its worthe the time to watch this great movie.
2,Wonderful Movie/Bad DVD,How could Universal release a favorite beloved DD film of such bad technical quality. It's a shame this movie was not remastered. Take a look at Warner Home Video of the Pajama Game if you want to see superior resolution. It's a shame to have just copied from VHS to DVD without the film being cleaned up.Pull it and re do it as it deserves to be 5 stars.
5,Pillow Talk,"The first and most successful pairing of leading man Rock Hudson and wholesome singing star Doris Day, Pillow Talk is colorful, lively and clever throughout. Both leads work beautifully together, with surprising comic flair. The inimitable Tony Randall is worth the price of admission playing Rocks neurotic, sad- sack buddy."
5,One of the Best!,"""Pillow Talk"" is one of the best classic movies out there! This movie is filled with humor and romance, and the chemistry between Doris Day and Rock Hudson is phenomenal!The story centers around a prim and proper interior designer and a ladies' man who constantly fight over the phone they are forced to share. Eventually the characters fall in love, under false pretenses, but the end result is a very charming and heart-warming love story.I would highly recommend this classic romantic comedy to anyone!"
4,A wonderful romantic movie,Doris Day and Rock Hudson - what more can I say. It is a great movie that you can watch over and over again. It is a multilayered treat with great subtleties.
5,"Danielle,14...my opinion",I love this movie it's one of my favorites. I love to watch old movies. Doris Day is my favorite actress. Her and Rock Hudson are a great pair. The film is also very funny!
5,I think that the movie is great,I think pillow talk is the best movie because it's very funny. His movies are great. I really enjoyed it
3,Comment on the Combo-pack not the movie itself,"With movies either you like them or you don't. If you want to watch Pillow talk you probably know the movie and want a copy.The combo pack comes with a DVD, Blu-Ray and Digital copy.Only real criticism is the Ultraviolet digital copy is SD only. Easy to redeem if you have a UV account. Pick your favorite service (Flixster, Vudu, Cinemanow....) enter the code and it's automagically in your library accessible from all of the other UV compliant services. Why studios persist in giving SD copies of movies with purchase of blu-ray confounds me."
5,"Great, Funny, Classic Movie","This is a great love story with tons of humor. This is one of my all-time favorites. How can you go wrong with Dorris Day, Rock Hudson, and Tony Randall. Definitely an American Classic and a national treasure."
5,Classic Doris Day,Lighthearted romp with a smart script. Hudson and Day are believable and Tony Randall is frosting on the fun. A great comedy/romance for people who like pre-greenscreen movies.
4,Party Line Problems,"This film was a lot better than I was expecting. Doris Day stars as an interior decorator sharing a party line with composer and womanizer Rock Hudson. Their constant battling over the phone is a source of much frustration, but in one of those it-could-only-happen-in-the-movies plots, Hudson ends up impersonating a Texan oilman and they fall in love. Day and Hudson demonstrate their considerable on-screen chemistry in this film, with good support from the perpetual romantic loser Tony Randall as Hudson's friend, and an underused Thelma Ritter as Day's drinking maid. The movie looks great, and is surprisingly adult given the time it was made. It is pretty predictable, but the laughs are there, the script has a number of good lines, and the whole production is very polished. It's not hard to see why Day and Hudson were a popular romantic team."
5,awesome,i love classic movies like these. story is funny and cute. the color in old classic movies are beautiful and rich. their trendy clothes are awesome to look at and it has a happy ending just how i like it. Rock Hudson and Doris Day are awesome and so is the movie! one of my fave. =)
3,Disappointed in Quality,"The quality of this blu-ray was no better than the regular DVD. They're both good, but from a Blu-ray I was expecting at least a little sharper picture."
1,Hitachi 310881 Slide Fence,Cheap plastic more appropriate for a child's toy. Floppy isn't helpful on a power tool.Broke the second time it was used. Don't bother with this one.
2,More Radical Feminism,"This book is like so many earlier feminist-oriented gender/rape books, I found it hard to dissect the information from the familiar propaganda.I don't need to be convinced that the gender bias in our culture adds to the instances of rape. This has been established time and time again.How about a fresh way of describing and dealing with this?"
1,This knife is dumb. Paint is yummy.,"I hope you all enjoy eating orange paint. Why would anyone put paint on a surface that will see much friction and wear during its lifetime? Why would someone put paint on a surface that comes in contact with food when it wears off? The cafe at my job uses these knives, and the paint is all worn off. Guess where it went. Perhaps the designers of these knives ate a few too many paint chips themselves as children."
5,Vivid picture of war at the front and at hone,"The best aspect of ""The Final Crisis"", apart from its detailed and powerful memior of combat, is Richard Engler's inclusion of descriptions of the U.S. home front as Army infantrymen pass through training and the voyage to Europe to reach the battefield.Engler descibes the process and circumstances by which many young men who had joined up expecting to take slots in Army aviation or officers' programs, instead found themselves issued rifles and sent into the forests and mountains of the Rhineland. Although Americans generally wanted to be leaders in the war effort and not rank-and-file soldiers, the brutal reality of battle losses swept away many well-laid personal ""war plans""."
4,Almost Perfect,"I can't really add much to the other reviews, except to say this is a great book for the WWII history buff. It neatly covers an area of combat that is often overshadowed by the Bulge. The only issue I have with this book is the flimsy paper cover...the book must be treated with care or it will fall apart."
2,tasted awful!,"i'm still in the process of trying different low carb bars, but i'd have to say the atkins bars are the worst tasting. they taste like cardboard. blech! and all the flavors taste almost exactly the same. AVOID!! the only good thing is that they act as a great appetite suppressant. after eating one, im not hungry for HOURS!"
5,Great Atkins Bar,"I've tried many of the Atkins Advantage bars, and this is by far my favorite. Also good are Chocolate Mocha Crunch and Chocolate Peanut Butter. Hopefully Amazon will offer these flavors soon. I highly recommend this product."
4,Better than most,"I have tried most nutritious bars on the planet and these rate pretty well. They don't have sugar or icky fructose but Splenda which makes them perfect for me. I don't want extra calories to sweeten a bar. Since I have bought these my appetite has gone away and I am not even an Atkins dieter. I highly recommend them for someone wanting a snack, (candy bar type treat), that will fill you up. A lot of protein and fiber, yes some fat, and no sugar. Thanks!"
5,One of the best bars I've tried!,"I really like this bar, the texture is not too sweet and icky like a lot of other brands which can have a nasty aftertaste. No sugar is awesome, most bars are loaded with sugar which seems like pure insanity to me.Just a note about carbs, one reviewer expressed concern that this bar had way more carbs than the next carb number. Net carbs are the carbs that count when doing Atkins & I think other low carb program. Fiber counts on nutrition panels as a carbohydrate but when dieting is a good thing, so you subtract it from the figures. Otherwise broccoli would even look like a high carb food! These, like most of the sweet food replacers also use sugar alcohols, which alter glucose levels very little but help with the sweet taste. I wouldn't eat this at every meal, but I really love them when I'm on the run and the only other options are bagels and muffins."
3,Too sweet for me,"This one was a bit too sweet for me. While overall it has a good texture and flavor, that extra kick of sweetness was a bit much. Some folks might prefer this bar, though, to its less sweet counterpart, the chocolate peanut butter bar. (The PB bar is my favorite)Suggestion: buy one of each flavor and do a taste test. Come back to your favorite for the 25-bar box discount."
3,Song of the Bride,I was looking for the older book by Seed Sowers I dont like the changes made to this book. Second book I read when Jesus saved me.I would like to get a hold of the older version if you carry it please let me know.
5,Slowly Digesting,I received my copy of the book right away and started reading it. It is great and so good that I can only slowly digest it for there's so much amazing content in the Song of the Bride.
5,Great show at a great price,"I bought the 'Complete: Seasons 1-3' about a month ago.The show is amazing- funny, intelligent and very well made. If you are a fan of Seinfeld or Arrested Development, you will love this. I might even rate this a bit higher. Everyone in the cast does a great job. The show is fast with a lot of witty comments so you can watch it over and still find stuff you had missed before.The delivery from Amazon was fine. The package arrived as expected and there were no damaged or missing contents."
1,Porn in Paris,"I purchased this book expecting to learn more about famous ex-pat authors living in post WW2 Paris. Indeed, the first part of the book, which concentrated on Richard Wright and James Baldwin, fully met my expectations. However after that the book details in minute detail the development of pornographic literature (heterosexual and homosexual)in Paris - authors and publishers. At some point I had enough and abandoned ship. It was just too boring."
5,This CD is great. Aretha at her best!,"I love this CD. From the dance numbers ""Get It Right,"" ""Every Girl (Wants My Guy),"" ""When You Love Me Like That,"" and ""I Got Your Love,"" to the soulful ballads of ""I Wish It Would Rain,"" ""Better Friends Than Lovers,"" and ""Giving In,"" it's great musical fun for all. I personally think it's much better than it's predecessor ""Jump To It."""
5,Best Acid Rap CD Ever,"I just wanted to tell you something before I go on with my review....if you are interrested in Acid Rap/Murder Rap then you will be pleased with any Esham the Boogieman cd. On Psychopathics underground circuit he is deeply backed up and is an amazing artist. MMFCL, this cd is very recommendable!"
1,Nas Rules,This is not rap buy rap albums like Nas and KRS-One and Rakim and Big Daddy Kane and Tupac and Kweli and Aesop Rock and even Necro those are all real rappers these are all wannabe thugs.
5,WICKETSHIT4EVA,im a huge Esham fan so i give this a 10/10 or whatever the rating system is classic Esham tho for sure and i think ill be buyin the cd too when i get the money already have a digtal copy and tape like i sed ESHAMFAN4LIFE and if you guys are too i recommed you pick this classic cd/tape/digtal copy or vinyl if they have 1 thats my review hope you guys like it
5,Only 17 and still kickin',"This classic blends acid rap with Esham's suicidalist rhymes. The lyrics are origonal and flow smoothly. ""Some old Wicket $h!t"" and ""4 all my suicidalists"" are trend setting songs that will never die."
2,Pure Poetry,"I can't say this text is really that great for its purpose of being an intro to poetry because while it had hundreds of poems, it only had a few pages on meter, rhyme schemes, etc. which made it frustrating when trying to analyze a poem given the few lines on each subject."
4,Great performance / Disappointing DVD,"The entire concert: song selection, musicians and camera work were all excellent. The less than sharp video quality and the lack of 5.1 audio were disappointing. Maybe I've been spoiled by the incredible audio and video quality of YesSymphonic DVD, but I was expecting more from this.If you are a fan of ""Classic"" Genesis and Steve Hackett, it's a worthwhile purchase, but the DVD seems to have been simply transfered from video tape without taking advantage of the capabilities offered in the DVD format."
5,The Hackett Magic!,"I love this DVD! There is no other like it, and that is because there are few bands/musicians out there today on the level of these guys. I saw Hackett with Genesis a couple of times back in the 70s and he is no different here. He still maintains the power and impact he always had. In fact, he is even better! John Wetton sings with such power and passion that he really adds to this performance. Hackett knew what he was doingwhen he assembled this band. Chester is also fantastic. There is alot of emotion here, even though they don't jump around the stage. They don't need to. Can't wait to see the concerts he recently recorded on tour in South America for DVD. Hopefully we will see them sometime in 2002! Buy this !"
5,A msut DVD for progressive rock fans,"Excellent musicians, music and program. If you like Genesis, King Crimson, Yes, etc. a MUST!!!!!! Not all musicians do gymnastics in order to catch your attention, these guys do not need that, THEY ARE GREAT musicians, they do it with music!!!!!!!! I really prefer the DVD to the CD, you can see them ""at work"", which is much, much better."
3,"Not as good as ""God Save the Queens""","The band is similar to Genitorturers and GWAR in stage presence. They tend to be more punk than metal. This disc is more goth sounding.As bands grow and evolve, they are bound to produce a few discs that are not as good as the others. That's basically how I feel about this one. Your experience may vary.I would recommend listening to ""God Save the Queens"" first if you have not heard anything from the Impotent Sea Snakes."

1,idaho place names a geographical dictionary,I have not yet received the product.....do you have an idea when it will be sent?
5,A must read for sexual abuse survivors and psychotherapists,As a psychotherapist I applaud Staci and Cleis press for finally providing a resource that addresses sex and the sexual abuse survivor. The book is well organized and provides exercises which address the mind-body connections. She also provides excellent up-to-date resources on many subjects.
3,"Good Introduction, Not Advanced","If you are a survivor of sexual abuse, primarily as a child, and you have not read other books on the subject, this can be a good first book. It introduces you to the concepts of alternative sexuality as normal, lays out guidelines to help you determine what is healthy sex for you, and offers some basic information about sex and sexuality. However if you have read other books or gone through a few years of therapy I don't think this book has much uniqueness to offer. If you are looking a solution, no book can offer you that, only lots of work and time can help things but there is no magic solution. Unfair? Completely since something that took a predator only minutes to do can take you years to recover from but then life isn't fair."
4,Why does this book cost so much?,"I know I'm not reviewing the book, but could someone please tell me why a paperback copy of this book costs over $60?"
1,This book is dangerous !,"I was attracted to the book's ""butch"" approach to healing- aggressive and bold. But the more I read, the more I disliked it. There is little supportive content and advocating BDSM for healing is dangerous. The author is not a professional psychologist or councellor and it shows.This book is for people well along the healing journey, don't start with this text. I think ""The Courage to Heal"" by Ellen Bass is still the best book for survivors."
1,The Survivor's Guide to Sex: How to Have an Empowered Sex Life After Child Sexual Abuse,This book has some helpful things in it but I did not care for the majority of the contents. It would be a good book for someone who is of lesbian orientation.
5,THE SURVIVOR'S GUIDE TO SEX,"THIS BOOK WAS DELIVERED IN A TIMELY MANNER,BOOK IS EXCELLENT FROM WHAT I HAVE READ SO FAR. VERY PLEASED WITH DOING BUSINESS WITH YOU ALL."
5,The BEST Thrash Album of All Time?,"Off the top of my head, I would have to say YES! Songs are all fast all Thrash and no ballads that would take most other LP's out of the running from this era. They perfected the Thrash sound. I have waited for over a decade to own this on CD and now I do. This band should have been HUGE, at least as popular as other bay area bands. If you like Metal, GET THIS CD!"
4,Top-notch 80's hardcore thrash,"Even though most kids know this band from having that dude from Machine Head in it, this is a very good but not earth-shattering Double CD. Lotsa shout choruses and breakdowns, but the energy is there and these guys had what it took to become a presence on the national metal scene. Ugly and hard as hell and worth the money."
5,very horrible music,"For a while I had heard very good things about this particular trash metal band so I did my best to get the original release which I was able to find on ebay for 30 bucks. So I finally get it and what do I get once I pressed play? nothing but 80s dinosaur worthless junk which I was told would sound like heavy metal legends Atreyu, My Chemical Romance, Hawthorne Heights and As I Lay Dying. These dirty long haired 80s hippies did not have any cool breakdowns and aren't even up to date with the lastest teenage style what with the girl tight pants and the hair flaps.This crap also made me realized how much the 80s sucked and all the music that came from that era."
5,Best Irish Instrumental,"In my relentless search for the best pure Irish instrumental music, I finally lit upon this remarkable CD. I'm sorry Chieftans and Bothy Band, neither of you have recorded an album of this caliber. Absolutely the best violin/flute interplays of any Celtic music I have ever heard. There is one bummer on the CD however, and that is the only vocal, a sea chanty called ""The Maid from Amsterdam"". Perhaps my aversion to this song on this album is personal. When I was a child, my Dad had an LP of sea chanties sung by renown baritone, Leonard Wilson, and Maid from Amsterdam was one of the songs. My advice to King's Galliard is let a master like Leonard Warren sing songs, and you guys stick to your instrumentals, as good or better than anybody in Irish music."
4,"Silken sound, polished playing","The Tokyo quartet, now restaffed since its original cycle of the Beethoven quartets, gives a silky, elegant performance of the Razoumovsky quartets on this 2-CD set. I really wallow in the sound, especially in the opening of Op. 59, no. 1, where the cello solo gratifyingly reaches into the deep dark colors of the cello and resonates. Bravo! No one can touch this except the Quartetto Italiano. Otherwise, there is a little more restraint, emotionally, than I like with these very romantic pieces. The Razoumovsky quartets are unrivalled for sheer beauty and richness of conception and sound. This recording is more memorable for its clean, elegant qualities than for any new realization of the pieces or distinctive emotional insight. Still, if you relish the sound of super audio CDs (and these are hybrid discs you can play on any CD player - I tried it), you will find these polished renditions are well worth the extremely reasonable price."
4,TIPPING THE SCALES,"There's a perverse satisfaction in THE AGGRESSION SCALE. Watching teenagers wipe out a horde of hitmen doesn't fit the average person's idea of ideal behavior even though their victims certainly deserve it. Still young Owen's ""aggression scale"" prophesies a psychotic future, a young man who delights in killing. His step-sister also seems to have a deadly future too.Dana Ashbrook (Twin Peaks) relishes his villainous role and perennial bad-guy Ray Wise chews up the scenery in his brief appearances. Ryan Westig evinces a chilling evil as Owen and Derek Mears' false bravado is almost comical.There's a low-budget cheesiness to this film, but its straight forwardness makes it entertaining. Not a classic, but a good escapist flick...a guilty pleasure."
3,The Aggression Scale,I liked it but it could have been better. Ray Wise is one of my favorite actors. He plays the Mob boss in this movie.
3,Entertaining film!!!!,It grabs you from the very beginning and does'nt let go!! I thought they could have done a little digging into Owens character. But I guess thats what you get in a 85 minute movie. I recommend this movie to any movie buff. Good but certainly not great!!!
2,Stars lie.,"I have a lot of B films.... I like a lot of movies most people say suck.This was another one of those ""case drags you in"" Synopsis sounds awesome.Get it home, that's about it.OH but you do get to see a grown up Solomon from Gummo."
3,Anger Issues,The boy needs to take some anger management classes. I knew a few of these types of kids in high school.
2,Under The Lilacs,"While most of this story is charming and delightful, I would caution anyone who is sensitive to animal abuse to give it a pass."
2,okay,I have read a lot of Louisa May Alcott. I have to admit I had a hard time getting into this story and enjoying it. I ended up putting the book down and not finishing it after several attempts.
3,"Run away, from the circus",I am sure everyone has herd a story sometime about a boy running away to join the circus. Well this book basically turns that upside-down. The boy runs away from the circus.
5,Under the Lilacs,"What a wonderful, wholesome book with lots of colorful detail and feeling. Loved it, would recommend it to anyone who wants a refreshing read."
3,A little slow-moving but a great book!,This book has a great story line - and sometimes makes you want to shake characters! But sometimes it got a little slow-going and I had to try 3 times to read the whole thing. But I was glad that I finished. My favorite character is the horse... I think her name is Lina... because I'm a huge horse fan. It's still a wonderful book but it is a bit to slow-going for me.
5,A real classic,Under the Lilacs is a wonderful story about a young boy and his dog. I loved all the adventures that the kids had. A must read for anybody who loved Little Woman.
1,Are you kidding?,I think i must restate my previous review- how long have you been listening to metal? (and paying attention to song structures?)
1,No good,How can you listen to this stuff. the sing just growls that's it. everybody can growl. How can you listen to this stuff.
4,Solid Gothenburg Death/Thrash,"I'm writing this to counter that other bad review too. The person who wrote that is an idiot. They paid attention to nothing but the vocal style, and maybe the guitar tone a little bit. Soilwork's riff structures are nothing like In Flames, and if the vocals are a ripoff (and its worth noting that all other Soilwork albums have mixed vocals), then In Flames by that logic, In Flames are just a Death ripoff anyway. Soilwork is doing a latter day Swedish version of thrash, In Flames does psuedo-classical riffs. Saying this album is an In Flames ripoff is like saying Testament ripped off Metallica or that Metallica ripped off Diamondhead. So Soilwork didn't invent a new sub-genre. Sorry!"
5,Amazing album,"This is one of the best albums by Soilwork along with Chainheart Massacre. Soilwork, along with the other Gothenberg bands just show how amazing Swedish melodeath is."
4,OH!!! S H I T!!!,"No clean vocals or popiness here people. This was what Soilwork entered as: brutal, melodic, and At The Gates-ish. Pretty much all the material here is fast as hell with Bjorn topping off some familiar Tomas Lindberg vox. It does get a bit tiring because there is almost no variety, but the band members make up for any problems with it.Peter Wichers of the crew lets loose everything he had on this album, shredding endlessly and outperforming anything he churned out on the latest Soilwork records. The first track is proof of what Soilwork was once able to do. Many of the newer fans are afraid or turned off by this and ""The Chainheart Machine"". I was too, especially at the covers (silly me), but I ended up growing over the vocals and started embracing this as soon as I did.Outstanding debut which would only be surpassed by the next album, but you should hear this any way you can nonetheless!"
3,Not bad - room for improvement,"Thermoelectric function works fine - good as a previously owned Coleman: but has several shortcomings: (1)the cheap latch, (2) very small plastic wheels that aren't easily pulled over curbs and are embarasingly noisy when pulled over most hard surfaces (vs larger rubber wheels which would have eliminated both issues, (3) the re-designed right side handle from the previously two part extendable (shown on Amazon and other sites) to a single longer handle that is also used to unhandily prop the lid open, (4) related to #3 are very thin plastic straps used to limit the lid opening to less than 90 degrees (propped open by the handle) instead of larger ones that would allow the lid to open past 90 degrees and rest in the open position retained by larger straps. I think the market would pay another $5-10 for these convenience features."
4,Kool Koolatron,"Good product, reasonable price. Have only used the cooler, not the warmer feature, but it worked as promised."
5,Burn notice season4,"Great action, plot twists, Character development. Very enjoyable viewing. Interesting new characters. A must have for Burn notice fans. Roasting White Collar as a special feature."
4,Not the Best Season but Still Great,"Maybe it is just me but I am a huge fan of Burn Notice and this season leaves me wanting more of the previous seasons excitement and humor. The addition of another character for no reason other than to have a token minority on the program has not helped either. They cannot decide if he is a competent spy or an idiot and they use him in either capacity as needed. The expanded role of his Mom has been an improvement in most cases (but not all).BOTTOM LINE: This is still one of the best shows on TV but this season is a little down from previous ones but all great shows have such seasons, keep watching because it is STILL Burn Notice and the original 3 characters make for a very entertaining chemistry."
3,Getting Repetitive I'm sad to say,"Well, maybe it's me but I think this season had a lot less unique storylines than the first three. I know ratings are still through the roof so perhaps it is me, but the stories this season didn't have the oompf and often felt forced. I love the characters though and I'm hoping for a stronger Season 5."
5,Great fun,"My wife and I both enjoyed Burn Notice Seasons 1 - 4 and look forward to Season 5 when it becomes a little cheaper. Sometimes the episodes are a little corny like I can't believe that Michael can speak Russian without an accent - heck the Russians can't speak English without a Russian accent. But we can't let occasional annoyances get in the way. ""We don't know how to repay you"" at the end of an episode also gets to be hackneyed. Maybe hearing a distant ""Hiyo Silver"" would suffice."
4,Burn Notice Season 4,"I loved this show, I hope that they do a season five even though he has completed his mission and has been reinstated."
2,Jesse needs to go,"I love the show, but find Jesse annoying. Go back to the original cast Michael, Fiona, Sam and Madeline are perfect."
2,Duty rip off,"Happy enough with dvd but still waiting on an answer from amazon as to why I had to pay 13.01 duty at post office, im still raging!"
3,"not as good, but still better than anything else on t.v.","For two seasons, this was the absolute best show on t.v. It's still pretty good, but it has deteriorated from Season 3 on. It feels like they got new writers who maybe didn't graduate high school. I take away two stars for two reasons: the Jesse Porter character, who is a total waste and who I was hoping would be killed off at the end of Season 4 (rats), and the mother, Madeline, who has way, way outlived her usefulness and is now just an annoying nag. Still a good show, with the potential to be stellar again by jettisoning the dead weight and tightening up the writing to its former brilliance."
4,A nice adventure,"This is a show that stays interesting and is suitable for the whole family. Burn Notice has something for every member of the family, even with differing tastes. It is a well written series, the cast stays interesting and entertainin and the writing has stayed unique throughout the length of the series so far. This is one of the finest shows I have seen to date in the last few years. Few programs measure up to the standards set here.Please bring back seinfeld though!"
4,great show!,"i was happy to see this show return to USA! in a world where most shows on tv are poorly written and highly predictable, i am glad to praise this show for it's originality and fun writing! i always have something to look forward to in Burn Notice! YAY!"
3,Hopefully Season 5 will redeem Season 4,"Season 1, 2, & 3 were great. It seems as if the makers decided to go low budget for Season 4. I couldn't help but notice riffs in the story and numerous editing mistakes on just about every episode. I really enjoy Burn Notice... But I hope they get their act together for Season 5."
5,GREAT PRODUCT. WHY DO i HAVE TO WRITE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WORDS. WHY CAN'T I JUST RATE WITH THE STARS?,GREAT PRODUCT. WHY DO i HAVE TO WRITE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WORDS. WHY CAN'T I JUST RATE WITH THE STARS?
5,"Late to the party, but glad I made it","I have always enjoyed a good spy thriller, especially when it takes a more personal twist. And I admit to not really following Burn Notice until season 4. I got hooked. I enjoy the characters, the twists and the plots. Its a great escape, with just the right amount of espionage, sex, and smart dialogue. It is better to see the series from the beginning, and I do have the DVDs (thanks Amazon!) but if you like TV that is fast, smart and a great escape, try keeping up with Michael Westen and friends. And yes, I want to spend a day hanging with Sam Axe (I will buy the mojitos)"
4,Good Business,"It was a good experience, the dvd's were in good condition. I enjoy watching them for the set that I have."
4,"Disks worked, content not bad","The disks had no problems and shipping caused no damage. The first episodes were really good. The last 5 or 6 episodes were not great, they made less sense than the first ones. It's like the writers were on holidays and no one thought it out."
2,"Love Burn Notice, HATE HYUNDAI super lame PRODUCT PLACEMENTS!!!!!","This episode is the culmination of worsening product placement by the show's producers. It has become completely annoying. Seriously, I had to stop mid-episode to write this review. I used to think Hyundai was a decent company, but I'm so irritated by this obnoxious product placement that I'll probably refuse to ever buy one. It was really bad in another episode, but in this episode, it is so bad that I feel angry at everyone involved.The narrator (Michael W) literally says, during a car chase that isn't really a chase, but just closeups of the car, ""Making a getaway is often more about precise handling than raw horsepower. So in a hostile situation, rear-wheel drive is a nice advantage. That said, it doesn't hurt to have over 300hp.""To the writers, producers, network and everyone else involved with this episode - Shame on you!"
3,Show going down hill,"We'd been waiting for them to get back to the more typical and fun formula of the show from the first and second season... season 4 only moves further away from that. Still some of the fun stuff, and the Jesse character grew on us, but overall, I think we'll just keep watching the first two seasons over and over instead of watching this season ever again."
3,Still enjoying the series - glad for new character,"Jeffrey Donovan is really starting to show his age--getting a little soft around the middle as compared to Seasons 1 and 2. It also seems like they're dyeing his hair to cover up gray--and doing a bad job of it.The chemistry of the cast is still good, but wearing a bit thin. I'm glad they introduced a new main character to shake up the storyline. It also helps that Coby Bell is easy on the eyes!Writers are doing a nice job of moving the conspiracy along. Would like to see a bit more of Simon. Garret Dillahunt always does a terrific job of playing the villian."
1,never seen it! blank dvd!,i got rip off! someone send me a blank kojak dvd! i am very very upset! may not order ever again! cant trust people to do right!
5,Graphic Communications Today,This is an excellent book. It is easy to understand and follow as a beginner and will definitely help the well seasoned graphic artist. I only needed it for a class but this is one text book that I will not be selling back!
4,School Textbook,"I used this book for a Communication Marketing class. Not bad for a text book. We rarely used the book, it was more for our teach to say ""go read chapter blah blah blah, and we will talk about it on Monday.""I liked it enough that I kept it rather than sell it at the end of the semester."
1,Great book if you are retarded.,"This books actually doesn't provide any insight into effective consulting practices. Rather, it's a description of the types of things that a consultant might do in certain situations. There's an entire chapter devoted to how to have a conversation. That would be great, if I didn't know how to have a conversation, but I wanted a system of tools and strategies that would improve my consulting abilities."
4,Great!,Great book. Easy to follow. I'm used to working with cm as opposed to inches (so there is a bit of conversion). This book uses a series of codes for particular measurements which are straight forward.What I would really like to see in this book is a section about adjusting the sloper to suit a body shape which is larger (such as the lower hipline) or adjusting darts for a larger size.
5,Navagation system on steroids!!!!,"First off, not for the faint of heart, this is one heck of a GPS unit. Too big for most cars, but one you would love to have. I have a Mistubishi Montero 04 and it fit perfect in the dash, however to veiw movies I had to tilt it making the install look less professional than if I placed it in the center console exciting angle. I love the XM radio which I already had, and the features aren't the best in garmins package, but it functional. Viewing videos are a nice touch, I purchased a vehicle DVD player for it also, but the angle to view is limited in a fixed install. All in all, love it, great deal on Amazon on price, but didn't like the cost of the add on XM antenna, $250.00 bucks more. but my savings on Amazon made the bitter taste easier to swallow."
3,"Great CD, rough traveler","The CD is great and in pretty good condition, however the case dos not travel well. I am sure it happened during travel, but when the CD arrived to me in the mail the case was all busted up. There were plastic splinters in the packaging and the case was cracked across the front. My initial thought was that the CD was cracked or scratched, but upon opening the case I realized the CD was still in tact and worked fine.Maybe just better packaging when mailed off, assuming it was in good conditioned when mailed."
1,hokum! bah humbug! shut up and sing!,"I bought this CD to use as background for a special Christmas Party being held for ex-pat Americans overseas.... when I ordered it, I tried the ""listen"" function to make sure White Christmas sounded right to me.... but I guess I did not read the reviews -- or I would have seen that bit about ""radio dialogue"" which is NOT in the product description. I wanted the music, not the old time jokes! It's hard enough to explain things in another culture!!!I was SO disappointed -- I'd only spent about $12, $6 for the CD and $6 for shipping -- but still......"
3,"Don't fall for the lie, but give it a try!!!","There are so many things this cd could have been named- something like ""Crosby's Radio Christmas"" perhaps. Instead the company resorts to trickery by trying to make you think you're buying an inexpensive copy of Bing Crosby's White Christmas- the well known album featuring Bing on the cover in a Santa Hat. You're not. Shame on these guys, and from the looks of the reviews, people are getting fooled. Now, that said, the cd is pretty good! It's nice to hear something other than the same studio versions. This is worth having. The sound quality is what you would expect from 1940's radio, but the content is warm, nostalgic, and VERY enjoyable. I just wish they hadn't tried to trick me. Even though it seems to be supporting their dirty trick, I recommend this cd. It's a nice collection, and not skimpy- which is rare for bargain Christmas cds.Give it a try, but don't believe the lie!"
4,Great Classic Christmas CD,It's Bing. It's Christmas music. What more do you need to know? There's nothing modern here. It's great background or sing-along music that your grandparents will love.
1,disappointing,If you want a great Bing Crosby Christmas CD purchase the White Christmas CD that shows him on the cover wearing a Santa hat. There you will find all the old favorites including some duets with the Andrew Sisters. This CD is a radio broadcast. It's choppy and doesn't flow like the other one. Some of the renditions are different also. I was very disappointed and wished I had been able to hear it prior to buying it.
4,Blade Runner material,"This is an very good resource; I used it to prepare resources for my secondary school students. It is especially good on production background, audience response and special effects as well as post modernist aspects of the film. This would be a good resource for media studies too."
2,Tedious Film School Psycho-Babble.,"Replicant Alert! Avoid this book if you have any affection for the movie. Except for the last couple of pages, the author has little to offer other than the usual drivel about ""Post-Modernism"". You will be much better off buying the Director's Cut on DVD, and watching it several times! This series of books has its exceptions, this is not one of them. Unintentionally hilarious in parts, as only the academician can be. Pretentious, ponderous cinema-scholar jargon that offers little of value or insight. Read Sammon's The Making of Blade Runner instead! (Nice cover, though...)"
3,Blade Runner or comic books,"Avid fans of the film will find many pleasures in this book. It looks, in depth, at the comic book roots (mobias, Heavy Metal) that Blade runner aspired from. It can, however, go on a bit too much about it. It does cover other aspects of the film, but the books highest point is the opening - which discusses vision within the film."
3,"Not bad collection, sound not very good","It's a collection of medleys like you'd hear in a seisiun. The number of hornpipes seems to me a bit unrepresentative - and one (Kildare's Fancy - thankfully my favorite hornpipe) is played twice. More, and more common, reels would have been better.The worst aspect of the CD is the recording quality. It sounds like it was recorded in a bar with an old cassette recorder. The sound is a fairly undifferentiated mass.So, not a bad collection of medleys - especially for the price - but certainly not outstanding either."
4,"Apparently, a healthier philosophy of science","If you're going to conduct research tomorrow and need a ""how-to"" book, there might be better choices. A more accurate title could be: ""A Healthier Philosophy of Science; Making Mincemeat out of Popper, Lakatos, Kuhn and Feyerabend"".I really enjoyed the book, although I'm ""Math-Impaired"" so I can't judge the more technical sections. Aspiring scientists should read it once, I think.The only serious shortcoming is when he says: ""Science rests on faith"", p. 152, because of the bad influence of Thomas Reid. A more appropriate epistemological foundation would be ""Thonnard, F.-J., PrÃ©cis de philosophie, Paris, DesclÃ©e, 1950"" (sorry, out of print, but I want to translate it and put it on my website, God willing).For more info, Google my name."
4,Brilliantly written.,"Having lived in the author's home for two years while in New York I am biased towards this niche masterpiece. Although my interests are on opposite sides of the map in relation to this book I had the privilege to witness, first hand, the author's diligence and perseverence in putting the finishing touches on his textual opus.In this book Mr. Gauch brings his statistical mastery with him in his endeavor to reconcile science, philosophy and religion in the public arena. In so doing he greatly enables scientists to become better at what they do by examining the foundations of the scientific method. This book is a must read for students of science and scientific professionals alike."
3,"A decent resource for beginners, but not nearly complete","This is a good starter book. It's in both standard and tab notation, which is always helpful. There's a cross-section of various types of celtic music, but it's not nearly complete. If you're a beginner you may find it useful, though."
3,encyclopedia schmyclopedia,"What ""encyclopedia""? It's just anthology of Celtic tunes, whatever you might be thinking.It's just a fake book, really. Single-note melodies in the treble with TAB underneath that. Chords are noted by letters above the treble. Some of the melodies are quite tricky.I guess by encyclopedia they mean ""big."" Well, no argument there. The thing's about 144 pages."
5,Excellent Cd !,"This is country as it should be! Allison is a great talent with great songs. If you hate the new pop-garbage country, also check Joni Harms, Heather Myles, Mandy Barnett's ""I've got a right to cry""(wonderful!) and Danni Leigh. I just pray for these ladies to keep themselves on the ""real country"" road."
5,Loved the whole album!,"After I saw The Horse Whisperer, I couldn't wait for Allison's CD to be released. She's a great singer AND songwriter!"
5,Excellent debut!,"Allison Moorer has won my heart and I've become a big fan. She has a very unique voice and such enormous talent. Her songs are so personal and revealing. She found a bit of success in 1998 with the song ""A Soft Place To Fall"" which was featured in the movie THE HORSE WHISPERER. The album ALABAMA SONG was released in the fall of 1998. The title track is one of my all time favorite songs by Moorer. The rest of the album is outstanding too. It opens with the wonderful ""Pardon Me"", into the great uptempo country tune ""Long Black Train"". The album closer ""Is Heaven Good Enough For You"" is a great song and definately one of the best tracks here. Other favorites include ""A Soft Place To Fall"", ""Set You Free"", and ""Easier To Forget"". If you want to hear something different, give Allison Moorer a try!"
2,Poorly made,"To begin with they are not stainless steel they are chrome plated pot metal. They function fine but are poorly made and I'm left to wonder whether they will break, or the chrome plating will peel off first. If you want something cheap and easy and don't plan on using them often they would be just fine."
4,"Great price, good quality","This was a gift for my sister and it came in nice packaging, good quality. It was her first set and she was very pleased with it."
5,Simple and easy,"Just write, peel and wrap around the cables. You need this if you have too many cables and want to quickly find out which cable connects where. Works for cables of all shapes and sizes, like power cords, small speaker wires,hdmietc."
4,where greatness began to be revealed...,"With 'War and Pain' and 'Rrrooorrr' (is that enough r's?) Voivod were a pretty typical thrash band that would be found on the heavy labels of the day like Combat, Megaforce, Metal Blade, Noise, etc. They wore the leather and spikes, played heavy and fast, and sang about death and ways to die and such. Not being native English speakers, Voivod's lyrics were often awkward in the early days also. But 'Killing Technology' is the turning point. The strides made from 'Rrrroooarrr' are amazing. Their progressive tendencies begin to show, especially on one of my all-time favorites, 'Forgotten in Space.' This is the first of Voivod's three brilliant albums in a row in my opinion along with 'Dimension Hatross' and 'Nothingface.'"
4,The unique Voivod sound is defined on this thunderous releas,"When you listen to this recording, you get the feeling that this isn't your average hardcore, instrument-thrashing band. The French-Canadian quartet (now a trio) brandishes heavy guitar licks, thumping drum beats, snaring vocals, throws in some unconventional time codes, and laces it all together with the precision and speed of a talented thrashcore band. They just don't sound like anyone else, with hard-rocking songs like ""Tornado,"" ""Ravenous Medicine,"" and ""Killing Technology,"" and off-beat tempo tracks like ""Lost in Space,"" and ""Too Scared to Scream."" What makes them different is the futuristic themes Voivod sings about, cyber-ghouls, intergalactic loneliness, etc."
5,Excellent sound quality and a great colletion of psych.,I dont appreciate lite psych and I usually dont like uk psych but this comp rocks. It's like the best of uk psych!
2,rubble vol. 11-20,"the only thing to really say about this box set is that it is not nearly as good as volumes 1-10, which i would give five stars because it is amazing.i love sixties psychedelia and the love peace and poetry compilations were really good, but still didn't quite do it for me. i bought rubble 1-10 hoping that it would be good and it was amazing. i bought rubble 11-20 for the same reason, but it wasn't. not even close.a lot on this box set sound similiar and quite frankly boring. its not nearly as refreshing as 1-10, but rather irritating after about the third or fourth identical volume. still there are a few gems sprinkled few and far between. bottom line, if for some reason you didn't buy 1-10 first, then go out and buy that one and save your money on the new one."
3,A very classy album but lacks a unifying thread.,"Aretha seemed to be vacillating between R&B and MOR-pop on this, her second Arista release. The title track duet with George Benson remains one of her smoothest and classiest hits and helped spur the album's sales. ""It's My Turn"", ""Hold On, I'm Coming"" and ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" were also very good but the rest of the album (while very classy) is merely passable."
3,Arista Years have been Hit&Miss,Aretha Franklin Hit Her Hey day on Atlantic in the mid to late 60's through the Mid to late 70's before going over to Arista Records.I like the title track She did with George Benson but after that it's a few Covers&Some Tracks that are signs of what was to come during Her 80's Arista Days til Now which has been Material that is Hit&Miss at Best to me overall.still there are some Soulful Performances here.
3,Kims review,Purchased the video Shania Twain came in on time and was very affordable. Watched it and was very entertaining for everybody.
5,Great accent to my license plate,They are the most eye catching thing on my car...instead of having the dealers info...I choose to have my own. Love Them. I get compliments on them all the time. And Amazon is prompt with their delivery...I am a customer for life. Thanx Amazon.
5,One of those delightful specific food masterpieces,"For those of us in love with pears, this is it! Beautifully photographed and essayed work on the variety and use of this fruit.For the different, try the Asian Pear rounds with Smoked SalmonCream Cheese or the Wine-Poached Salmon with Pears and Shallots.If you're a pear afficanado as I am, try and find yourself this little gem!"
1,Unpleasant man bullys unlikable woman,"In this Regancy Romance, a husband & wife get along so badly that they have lived literally separate lives for years--in different houses. The wife approaches her husband saying she wants a divorce and a child. The husband says no way, he doesn't like her enough to go through the expense of divorcing her and encourages her to find a lover/potential husband with the guts to front the divorce costs & political maneuvering for her.When the wife calls his bluf and starts to do just that, the husband's personality totally changes. His new policy is ""move in with me or I'll ruin your life"" plus a healthy dose of ""have sex with me to get pregnant"" and ""you'll play 2nd fiddle to my mistress, who will be living with us"". Blech.On top of the repulsive and inconsistent plot, both husband and wife are 100% unlikable. Avoid this turkey."
5,"Fabulous, fascinating and sexy","If you want a meal, you order Eloisa James. If all you can handle is a soft serve, there are plenty other options out there for you. Ms. James has a poet's gift with language, a satarist's voice and a Sex In the City appreciation of the physical aspects of a love affair. I LOVE Eloisa James. Please, please, please keep up the dynamite work!"
1,Overbearing Hero and dimwitted heroine:,"I was looking forward to this book having read the previous ones in this series however, it was a disappointment. Rees is just awful and his character didn't get any better. Helene gave in to him at every point. For a woman who lived apart from her husband for 10 years, you would think she would have developed some backbone and maybe a brain to go in her head. The entire premise was faulty and not in the least romantic. The idea of having a mistress esconced in the house with his wife as romantic would require me to suspend my brain from functioning. Although well written, the plotline and characters leaves much to be desired! I truly hoped and expected a better book from Ms. James!"
1,i tore it up in frustration!,"I wish i could give it no stars. This book made me cry in frustration. I literally threw it against the wall and tore it up. It does indeed start well with a promising premise, but the moment the heroine starts to come into her own (and meet a great new guy) the jerk of a husband returns. Make no mistake, he is a jerk. Self -centered, inconsiderate, mean, and downright cruel at times to Helene. I couldn't fathom why she would want to be with him. I don't want to give the plot away for anyone who wants to read it but he treats her in a way that no woman should be treated and she takes it! She just goes along with every stupid demand he makes on her. It was surprising that a woman who could stand to be away from him for 10 years would give in so easily.All of the secondary characters are fascinating. And although I tore the book up in frustration, I would like to read other books by this author. But don't read this one if you have any self respect."
3,Not quite,"Having read Eloisa James' last book ""A Wild Pursuit"" and finding it thoroughly lacking, I was a bit skeptical about this one. The story is about Helene, Countess Godwin, and her estranged husband Rees. She wants a divorce, he doesn't, she changes her mind and now wants a baby, he agrees only if she moves in with him. While the scenes between Rees and Helene were intriguing, Eloisa James left me wanting more; I found myself skipping the pages that did not involve them (and believe me, there were a few).All in all, ""Your Wicked Ways"" was a good romance, I could feel the chemistry between the two protaganists, and I would have given this book a full 5 stars if only the author had concentrated more on them and less on Helene's friends."
1,Beyond bad,"I wish I could give a no-star rating. This is one of the absolute worst male lead characters I've ever read. Rees is abusive, vicious, selfish and cruel. The heroine is weak and rather pathetic. Even keeping in mind the time period, this relationship is deeply unhealthy and abusive.I've enjoyed other books by this author but this was a complete failure."
1,Let's examine this in perspective...,"Eloisa James is one of those authors (for me, at least) who is either hit or miss -- most often miss. Bored one evening, I decided to give this novel a shot (hey, why not?). It was a mistake. I won't bother summarizing the story since so many previous reviewers have already done that. Instead, I'll *try* to justify one ""good point"" that the novel might have had.True, the heroine was insufferably weak-willed, and the ""hero"" more of a bastard-boor than a dashing lord. However, the mÃ©nage Ã  trois between the earl, the countess, and the mistress was surprisingly...evocative of the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire's marriage at the turn of the 18th century. So if that was what James alluded to (albeit comically), then props for her. If not, well, there's not much saving grace left to say for this book."
3,Just Missing Something!,I was waiting for Rees and Helene's story but once I read it found that it just lacked....something. I was intrigued by the chemistry between Rees and Helene but was bothered by the romance between Rees's brother and Rees's mistress. I felt like Eliosa James spent too much time on that love story rather than devoting more of the time to Rees and Helene and that made the story somewhat lacking.
1,I was shocked it could be this bad!,"I was so dissappointed in this book. Having read some of her other books and loved them, I felt so let down. How I wish I got online and checked out other reviews before I spent money on this! The hero, and yes, that is not a term I like to use for this jerk, had NO redeeming qualities. Wow, totally self absorbed, insensitive and to top it all off - BAD in bed. How this piece of [...] got past the editors, I will never know, but take my advice and pass on this one. I am especially appalled at the way the writer has the heroine still ""love"" this creep in spite of everything he does to her. It buys into that horrible mind set that women should be abused emotionally and call it ""love."" Sick, sick, sick! Re-read a Julia Quinn or Lisa Kleypas and run the other way and save your money!"
3,"Space age look, stone age sound.","The truth is, this headset looks and feels awesome. The bad part is, the mic is too far away. The person calling you can be heard pretty clearly. On the other hand you sound like you are ten feet away from your phone. As the power is drained this problem gets worse. However it seems to sound better if you use a Motorola phone with the head set instead of other brands of cell phones....strange. Volume controls are adequate, from a whisper to an ear shattering scream. Blue blinky light is capable of being turned off. All in all this headset does a pretty good job, as long as you are in a quiet room while talking on it."
4,good entry level product,I have used many different Bluetooth devices. This is comfortable and light. It paired easily and has a nice auto shutoff feature. I would recommend this for less experianced users and folks who are prone to lose things. I say that because the price is low enough tht if it is lost another can be obtained inexpensively.
5,send me no flowers,Great movie and was happy to be able to see it on the kindle. I hope other Doris day movies receive the same compliments. Her movies have always been clean funny and moral. She is a well rounded actress- singer and dancer who has provided hours of entertainment when I was able to watch her movies on DIaling for DOllars when I was in grade school. I hope they will always be available.
4,Send Me No Flowers,"This was quite a movie, lots of silliness and twists and turns. Doris Day and Rock Hudson were a good pair,as in the other movies they star together in. Tony Randall was hilarious in this movie and the other charactors they cast (the doctor and funeral caretaker) were really great too. It's a pretty typical kind of movie for this pair."
4,Pretty Funny,"The movie is very funny, with Rock Hudson playing a hypochondriac named George. He is at a doctors appointment, when he overhears the doctor discussing a dying patient on the telephone. Immediately, he assumes he is the dying one. He then starts searching for a new husband for his wife with the help of his friend Arnold. The only problem is that Arnold must say the name George at least 10,000 times. It can get exsaperating. Overall, it is a very funny movie, but kind of gets of out hand at the end."
3,Harmless Fluff,"Rock Hudson stars as a hypochondriac who misinterprets a conversation his doctor is having about a dying man and believes he is the man that is on his way out. He confides his situation to neighbour and pal Tony Randall so they can find someone for his wife, Doris Day. Of course, there are a lot of crazy mix-ups that you would expect with this kind of film. I honestly can't say I laughed very much. I've never found any of the star trio to be particularly appealing, so there probably wasn't much of a chance of me really enjoying this at all. Paul Lynde plays a cemetery plot salesman and is really funny. The movie is a pleasant time filler, but there's not much here that's fresh or even interesting, and I suspect audiences today will think they've seen it all before."
5,Great 60s movie,"If you enjoy Rock Hudson/Doris Day movies, you will love this cute movie. While it doesn't contain the violence or foul language that permeates the movies of the past 20 years, it merely entertains, providing a fun escape from life. Tony Randall is great, as usual, and the movie provides the typical Hudson/Day comedy. No special effects, just good, clean humor."
5,Nice Tray,"Although you can make your own humidity tray for far less than what this one costs, for convenience and quality these trays are very nice. I have this tray sitting on a metal 14""x 36"" 4 shelf unit and I am happy with the large amount of usable space this tray provides. Waldor Orchids shipped this out very quickly."
5,Going strong with only need of battery replacement every 3 years.,"Last I checked, it was still running since 2007! If it is still working, Merry Christmas dad. hehe Sorry I could not give you more."
2,Little dissapointing,All songs are almost the same. No variety of folklore and culture as it should be.
2,Didn't download it free.,The samples were so awful (who left the reverb on?!) that I didn't download it even though it was free. That's just sad.
4,did there job,I used the hood pins to hold the hood down because the regular latch broke and it has not blown up yet so it works
3,"Cat loves it, but it does end up messy","Second fish my 19-year old cat's gone through in several years. He loves it. Loves it so much his claws have perforated the cloth and over time, the catnip just comes out in little piles. Don't know or think there's really a way around that - it's just the nature of this type of toy. Just expect it and expect to replace this every year or so, depending on how much your cat plays with it."
3,Beyond the Sea,I am a Bobby Darin fan and enjoy his music. I enjoyed this film even though some scenes were a little too unrealistic.I think Kevin Spacey did a wonderful job!
3,Wanted more and less,"Wanted more complete Bobby Darin songsWanted less Kevin Spacey interpretation (altho very good)Wanted better cutting, better flow of story linesWanted less choppiness, less ""HUH?"" feelingWanted better development of Sandra Dee personalityWanted better understanding of the relationship between the twoWanted a decent sound trackLiked surrealistic visuals and time line jumpsNext time maybe I should rent it first."
1,Spaced Out Spacey,"Im a huge Bobby Darin and Sandra Dee, I think spacey is a great actor, this film is...The story sounds good Bobby himself (played by Spacey)narrating the movie of his life, unfortunately did not translate from idea to much of anything. Spacey is way tooo ooold! to be playing Darrin. This film is part musical, comedy, Drama with a whole-lot-of cheesy. Im very disappointed, Spacey practically did the whole thing, wrote, directed, sang, produced....too much,way too much...Spacey should have hired a younger actor and focused himself on directing or producing, and not tried to do everything himself.Kate Bosworth is great as Sandra Dee, but she has ZERO chemistry when she's with Spacey, instead of lovers it looks like father and daughter ,totally grossed me out.Id recommend a rental if that....hopefully someone will try to make a Bobby Darin movie as good as ""Ray"" a movie about Ray Charles .Lets hope."
2,Too old to pay Darin,"I have always liked Kevin Spacey but he should have cast a younger man to play Bobby Darin. At 45 years old, Kevin Spacey was too old to play the lead role and could not watch the entire movie because of this reason. Keep in mind that Bobby Darin was only 37 when he died. Not only did Kevin Spacey try playing him at 37, he tried playing him at 20... at the age of 45! No, I couldn't get past the huge age difference."
5,Entertaining film with great spin on the flashback.,Solid performances through the film. Spacey looks like he is having a great time in the movie. The attention to detail is spectacular! We need to have more films like this one for all are pop stars!
4,Hugely successful movie in creating new fans of the great Darin,"This movie is a huge success in one of Spacey's stated goals: introducing people to the talent of Bobby Darin. The one two punch of ""Beyond the Sea"" and ""Mack is Back"" has recruited many new fans, me among them.I (diplomatically) won't even review it in detail on other criteria like whether or not it accurately depicts Darin's fascinating life (cough, not) or whether it stands alone as a successful and entertaining movie bio (ahem, doesn't) or whether Spacey should have used Darin's superior voice instead of his own, er, less superior voice or whether a 45 year old should have portrayed a character in their early 20's who is courting a 16 year old girl (uh, creepy). All I care about is...This movie is huge successful in introducing people to the massive talents of the great Bobby Darin. Thanks Kevin."
1,"In a word, ""Dreadful""!","Yes, Kevin Spacey was too old to play the up-and-coming Bobby Darin -- when Darin was Spacey's age, he'd already been dead eight years. Yes, the script is awful, the story-within-a-story framework strained and messy. The dancing's grotesque -- probably designed to cover for the fact that Spacey can't dance. And yes, most of the acting is cringe-inducing: Bob Hoskins and John Goodman giving tired retreads of every other performance they've ever given; Kate Bosworth -- forgeddaboutit! But the biggest problem with ""Beyond the Sea"" is that it shows up Darin's determination to out-croon and out-star Frank Sinatra for what it was: a succession of embarrassingly tacky recordings and live performances (with maybe one or two exceptions) supplemented by B-movie attempts at acting. In that sense, it's a homage tha backfires."
4,A great movie,"Though a little long, BTS is a well acted piece of work. Spacey turned his passion into a joyous musical. Kevin's acting and singing are spectacular, and in the end I found myself knowing more about a crooner from way before my time."
4,Love Bobby Darin,"Well done movie about BobbyDarin. Good acting, easy to follow, great music. Better because Spacey did his own singing. A must for fans of Bobby Darin"
1,Don't,watch this movie!! This movie was soooooo boring. Too much swearing for a PG-13. I would have given it an R rating.
2,Uneven,"While Kevin Spacey's performance is impressive, the storytelling devices jump around uncomfortably. I enjoyed the musical portions and learned a little about Bobby Darin, so it was not a total waste of time, but almost."
2,Disappointment all around,"I love Kevin Spacey, I love Bobby Darin's music, I love John Goodman and I couldn't wait to see the film. I was really impressed by Kevin Spacey's performance and his fantastic voice but I struggled to stay awake after about the first 20 minutes. I don't know what I expected - a serious biopic about an interesting life, snuffed out all too early probably. What did I get? A 50's type ""am I a musical?"" ""am I a romance?"" ""am I a comedy"" series of OTT (over the top) images punctuated by Darin songs.Sorry, this DVD is being recycled as soon as I can find a taker.P.S. but Kevin Spacey is still one of my favourite actors.... just not in this awful film!"
2,average,"Kevin Spacey wanted to Pull off doing the Bobby Darin story&He did alright in spots,but in others he was out of his element.Spacey just seemed like a Actor trying tocapture a Role He didn't have his blood in.take what Jamie Foxx did with Ray Charles&then get back to this film&you'll see How One Actor was able to truyl transform himself into a Role while another was there,but was missing the soul&Warmth to pull it off.also using the Kid as a Alter Ego to go back reminded me of Richard Pryor's ""Jo-Jo Dancer"" with trying to put all the pieces together.a watachable film,but makes you want to hear&See Bobby Darin that even much more so,Spacey did aight at singing&handling the film,but He just lacked a Certain vibe.Spacey is a really Good Actor,but this film was overlooked for a reason."
3,Is Beyond the Sea still playing?,"I have not been able to find anywhere nearby me ""Beyond the Sea,"" Is playing. Is it still showing or in limited release?"
4,very entertaining,wow some people are so critical!! i thought it was a fun enjoyable movie. kevin spacy was excellent in both song and dance. i kind of came upon this movie by chance and i am glad i did!
5,Spacey Does It Again,"I was a teenager during the 50's and never cared much for Bobby Darin nor Sandra Dee. I recently saw the Movie ""Beyond The Sea"" and wish I had paid more attention to Bobby Darin when he was recording. Kevin Spacey did a terrific job of portraying Darin.I enjoyed the movie so much that I intend to purchase a copy of the DVD as soon as it is released so that I can watch it again & again."
2,Boring,"I wanted to learn more about the life of Bobby Darin. Yes, those of us who weren't born back in the 30's, 40's, and 50's, still know of him.I could have done without the fantasy song and dance sequences - I felt those detracted and distracted from the storyline."
4,Returning to Bobby Darin,"This was terrific to watch and become reintroduced to the genious of Bobby Darin. My recommendation would be to watch this movie and then watch the ""real"" Bobby Darin at work. Awesome!!"
4,Kevin Spacey nails it!,"Beyond the Sea was a labor of love for actor Kevin Spacey, he wrote, directed, and stars as singer Bobby Darin and boy he does a wonderful job. Spacey is good in every movie but in this particular role, he shows how colorful of an actor he really is. Kate Bosworth also stars as Sandra Dee, she does an ok job but watch this film if you are a die-hard fan of Bobby Darin's classic music. This movie comes off a tad bit self-indulgent but entertaining. Give this biopic a try. Enjoy!"
4,Beyond the Sea,"GREAT show. The only portions I didn't care for were the two ""fantasy"" scenes. They were over done and out of place in the movie. Spacey has a great voice and the movie is a lot of fun."
4,john reid australia,"Being a Bobby Darin fan from way back I was pleased to learn of Kevin Spacey's plans to film his life story. The very talented Spacey has brought Bobby Darin's singing and night club perfomances to remarkable life on the big screen with wonderful memories re-kindled with Darin's hits including Mac the Knife , Beyond the Sea , Dream Lover and many more. Spacey's performance matches Joaquin Phoenix brilliant Johnny Cash renditions. However with all this praise Kevin Spacey as younger Bobby and relationship with Sandra Dee ( Caroline Aaron ) does not feel real as the age difference does not work despite the very obvious black wig.The very professional supporting cast of John Goodman , Bob Hoskins , Brenda Blethyn and Greta Scachi are a highlight. DVD extras are a bonus.Dissapointed Spanish sub-tiles visual throughout movie."
4,An Engrossing Movie for the Most Part,"Bobby Darin was a fascinating performer and personality and Kevin Spacey is a great actor and, surprisingly, a helluva singer and dancer, and the two combine to make a very absorbing movie. Spacey's performance is A-plus, as is that of Bob Hoskins. Most of the rest of the cast are also very good with the exception of Kate Bosworth, whose recreation of Sandra Dee is rather tepid and uninvolving. Although Dee is presented as (and apparently was) the great love of Darin's life, she still seemed pretty marginal compared to his passion for and devotion to entertaining. This movie is clearly a labor of love for Spacey and it is well done, although I found the whole conversation-with-myself-as-a-child aspect rather offputting--it seemed to me to interrupt the flow of the story and to be a little pretentious or self-conscious. I am a great fan of Darin and of Spacey, however, and any movie that combines the two as intriguingly as this one does can't be bad."
2,QUITE BAD,I grew up with Bobby Darin and this movie didn't do him any justice. Spacy tries but he dosen't make it as Bobby. He shows his age which even the makeup can't hide. Although Spacey has a nice voice I would have preferred having Darin's actual voiceover for Spacey. And all that dancing is not what Bobby was all about. The scence's with the kid takes away from the story and they missed a lot of Bobby's life because of all the screen time wasted with the kid.
2,Spacey's Yentl,"Like Streisand, Kevin Spacey is a big enough star to get away with indulging in ONE musical bomb. His singing, dancing and acting are superb in this film. In fact, they're the only reason to sit through this movie.You know a script is bad when the actors have to break into song and dance for no reason. I don't know much about Bobby Darin, but I hope his life wasn't really as boring as this film makes it seem."
3,a decent effort,"I'm glad there is renewed interest in Bobby Darin, who was truly an all-around performer. Kevin Spacey's talent is matched only by his ego...he acts/sings great, but the screenplay/direction were underdeveloped. Despite the unfolding of his upbringing through childhood flashbacks, you really don't get good insight on the main character or his personal relationships. I would consider this more of a musical than a drama."
1,Kevin Spacey's ego,I have great respect for Kevin Spacey as an Actor but as a singer not so much. I love Bobby Darin and I grew up with him so when I saw the movie at the video store I was really excited to take it home and watch it. Much to my dismay I didn't have my glasses on so I only assummed that Bobby Darin would be singing. Big Shock......What was Kevin thinking and who said he could sing? He was much too old to play Bobby and though he tried to move like him his timing wasn't there. If Kevin loved Bobby as much as he said he did he should have found somebody who could play the part and he could just direct it. I wouldn't recommend this movie to Bobby Darin fans because they will only be disappointed.
4,Beyond the Sea,Kevin Spacey is dynamic this movie is taylor made for him infact if you turn away from the TV you are listening to the REAL Bobby DARIN it's that good well done Kevin and the band arrangments are fantastic with great playing. Thanks Amazon the service you provide is first class the 3 items were delivered within 2 and a half weeks and Im in Australia !
3,Beyond the Sea,"I am thrilled that the world will now know just how talented Bobby Darin really was. I am honored to have known Bobby as a friend. Go see this movie. Take the whole family. Kudos to Kevin Spacey.Suzanne LewisValley Village, CA"
1,UNBELIEVABLE!!!!,"If there was such a rating as 0, would definitely enter it. Having known Bobby, since 1959, until 1972, this is the most BLASPHEMOUS bio of him. Bobby, was, definitely, not an ""A*****E. Can't believe that Dodd, or Steve Blauner, allowed this film to be produced. Now, let's get to Spacey's performance: DEFINITELY, NOT ""Oscar"" material. He can't sing, and worst of all, unable to dance. His overall performance, was a ""THUD""!!!! The sequences in the film, didn't even ""jive"" with the truth. Example: ""Beyond The Sea,"" was recorded many years prior to Bobby's relationship with Sandra Dee. Never heard Steve Blaumer, referred to, as ""Boom Boom."" As great as Kevin Spacey is as an actor, he should have never have attempted to sing, or, dance. Almost, not an ounce of truth, in this film."
5,Kevin Spacey is a genius!,"I didn't know anything about Bobby Darin but I always liked Kevin Spacey. On New Year's Eve, I watched Larry King's interview of Kevin Spacey about Beyond the Sea and became very curious about the film. My friend and I went to the movie theater without knowing anything about Bobby Darin and his music. We were totally blown away by the story, the music and, above all, Kevin Spacey as the star, the co-writer, the producer and director.The film captures the highlights of Bobby Darin's life and tries to tell an extraordinary story with heavenly songs and dance within 2 hour's limit. Kevin Spacey is a master in storytelling! He may not be as good as the real Bobby Darin, but he certainly acts like he is. I've seen many of Kevin Spacey's movies and once on Broadway a few years ago. There is no doubt that he is a very talented actor. However, with Beyond the Sea, he proves to be a master of film making."
4,A tribute to Bobby Darin,"I thought this movie was just a delight. I will buy the DVD when it is released and watch it again. I did not give the movie 5 stars because some of the important details about Bobby Darin's life were omitted. For example most acts of the time started in the Pocono's; as he did. I just think it would have added depth. As would his friendship with Dick Clark.Kevin Spacey does all his own singing and dancing in this film. And he does a great job. He has captured the essence of Bobby Darin. His performace is so good in this movie, that I would like to see him in concert. And Kate Bosworth did an admirable job of playing Sandra Dee. This is a great musical and a must see."
3,High hopes,"Lots of music & it's nice to see the story of BD fleshed out a little, but it was disappointing. You always got the impression that Kevin Spacey was ""acting"" a part - he never seemed to really be in character except the very end, and his singing just left you wanting to hear Bobby Darin. Kate Bosworth was so-so as Sandra Dee. (the honeymoon scene was well-acted). Supporting cast was great except for John Goodman (who I usually like) but he was so foul-mouthed that it ruined otherwise great scenes. Save your money."
4,Great flick (and I didn't even know the guy!),"Admittedly, Bobby Darin was a tad before my time, but I got the DVD because I know Kevin Spacey picks great roles. And this one is no exception. You can tell he enjoys playing the part of this driven superstar/achiever and pushes the acting envelope himself to portray this gifted singer/songwriter/performer. Spacey probably chose this role because he could identify with Darin's struggles with talent, fame and fortune. This movie is part biography and part Molin Rouge- so it's presented in a semi-factual, semi-musical format. But if you sit back and just enjoy the ride, it's a great film - one that leaves me wishing I had known this singer better - and in a way, I guess now I do."
1,Ego trip,"This could have been an interesting film. Somehow, due to Kevin Spacey's over-identification with Darin, he had no objectivity and the result is a mess. I watched it for about 45 minutes, really trying to like it, but finally exited it. As many others have pointed out, Spacey is way too old to play the young Darin. He sings allright but his moves are way too cool, too snappy, too everything icky...It was embarassing to watch this very talented actor descend into this terrible role. He should have spent the money on good pyschotherapy to discover what motivated this obsession."
5,Great Movie and Spacey is outstanding,"I love this movie, not because of Bobby Darin, but because of Spacey. His singing and dancing remind me of Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire - he's not as great a dancer as these two, BUT I enjoyed the movie as much as Kelly's and Astaires. Maybe the movie did skip over important parts of Bobby Darins life (according to the die hard Darin fans), but for the average person, this movie is delightful and Spacey is well worth watching."
4,Inspiring movie about complicated song writer.,"Beyond the sea is a great story about Cole Porter, who was an amazing song writer and had a complicated lifestyle."
2,Not the type of programming I care for.,Thios was a dissapointment. I expected a lovely musical and life story. It contains language etc. that spoiled the story and music.
2,Spacey just too old.,"Okay movie, very good music, very good singing by Spacey. The big question for the viewer, though, is the obvious one: Can you accept the middle-aged Spacey playing the young Darin? I could not. The age problem was particularly jarring in scenes between Spacey and Kate Bosworth."
3,Below the deep six,"You can't fault Kevin Spacey for his well intentioned love affair with Rat Pack era crooner Bobby Darin. His singing here is top notch, and his dancing is eye opening. But the movie is a structural mess, replete with three full blown fantasy dance sequences that are interruptive and an intrusive boy who is supposed to be Darin as a kid, now looking on as Darin tells the story of his ill-fated life, cut short by a bad heart. The device doesn't work well. Neither do Spacey's voice-overs. You never get the sense of Darin as such a great performer either, though the movie tries to convince you that he was. He's all but forgotten now, and his music, much of it, hasn't aged well. The love interest with Sandra Dee lacks heat. And Spacey is just too old and jowly to play Darin anyway. Give him an A for effort. It just doesn't work."
4,Good compliment to the king of cool,"I found this to be a good, solid, enjoyable movie. Kevin Spacey may have been a bit to mature to play the role but Bobby always looked older than he was and Spacey really was into the role. You can tell this was a labor of love for Spacey. I liked that level of feeling. The supporting cast is excellent as well. Some may say the plot played like a B movie or was to melodramatic but Bobby Darin was all that in life. Probably more so than even portrayed here. I also liked the occasional flashback / surrealistic approach as well. Great music and a good, solid tribute to a man who beat the odds and became a great entertainer by his own strong will and drive... ."
1,Horrible waste of time,"I was so looking forward to this movie. Within minutes I knew it was a stinker, as Kevin Spacey from the very start did not look or sound like A great entertainer. After seeing this movie....was Bobby Darins whole life about his hair???. How did he get a recording contract? Why no mention of his divorce or 2nd wife??? Why not call this what it was..The Kevin I want to sing and dance story."
2,enjoyable,"The movie was enjoyable. However, I wish I had known it had Spanish sub-titles before I bought it as a gift for my mother."
1,no info,no info that the movie has spanish caption all throughout the movie. the subtitle was annoying as we cannot remove the captions.
2,Un-interesting,"From what I remember of him, Bobby Darrin was a colorless character, trying to be more than his talent would allow. This is pretty much how this movie comes across.Kevin Spacey appears to capture him well, as a vain and ultimately a lonely young man who, in the end, faded away from relevance. But this does not make for a good movie. The movie seemed to be very selective in what it presented, and created no sympathy for the man or for those around him. I was glad when it was over and I can not recommend it as worthwhile viewing. There are much better movies out there based on the life of a musician, and with more interesting characters, such as De-Lovely or Ray, and this one just does not belong in that category."
5,Joyfull Listening,"For heaven's sake get this cd! It blew me away when I first heard it - I had checked it out of the local library. This is warm and spirited music. Lots of hits, some deep-dyed tangos. Beautiful version of Cartagenera, one of my favortites on the cd.. love also the beautiful and poignant ""Los ejes de mi carreta"" by Argentine folk composer Atahualpa Yupanqui. Now, not all the songs are actually from Argentina! Some are from Spain, Mexico and other places. Never mind. It's all wonderfully done and I think you'll love it to pieces."
1,Fistful of Alice - with a new name/cover,"If you are a fan, you already own this. Sure, it's a great concert, but do you need two copies? I would guess that a high percentage of sales are duplicate purchases. This is an intentional rip-off."
2,not an easy listen,"I am a fairly big bjork fan, but this album really dissapointed me. The lack of instruments and lots of vocal layering really dosen't work well. There's only 1 or 2 good songs on the album....i'm curious to see how this album will be pulled off live. darn. i think bjork is focusing more on the act of experimentation and less on quality songs. i wish i liked it more, but i can't even listen to it all the way through."
5,Hated It. Loved It.,"When I first bought this CD I listened to it and then threw it under my bed, upset that I actually spent money on it. I ""discovered"" it about 6 months later and gave it another try. I started to like the track ""Who Is It."" Then ""Oceania."" Before long, the entire CD was growing on me and I kept it in my CD player, playing it with increased frequency. Then it became all I listened to and my friends thought I was insane. I let a friend borrow it and told her to throw it under her bed when she finishes listening to it the first time. It is total love-hate. Amazing."
1,Has Bjork Run Out Of Hits?,"I received this album for my birthday and I must admit, I wanted to send it back. I am a Bjork fan since the Sugarcubes and have always been so impressed with her vocal talents and her vision. But I must say this album is just not what I expected. I just can't sit through an entire album of just vocals and no studio instruments. I am sad to say that she doesn't sound great accapella and this album leaves very much to be desired."
3,her worst...,i had always loved bjÃ¶rk very much..but after vespertine i started to adore her... it was the best cd i had ever had..so it made me curious about the forthcoming album.butdefinitely medulla did not make me satisfied..i din not findfind it so much interesting or atractive..it is unfortunatelyunlistenable and weak i think...it is like wearing paperclothes..making it can be enjoyable wery much but listening isnot..some of the vocals comes so immature that while listeningi'm trying not to hear but i can not succeed...in brief it isthe worst bjÃ¶rk album...1. Pleasure Is All Mine: 82. Show Me Forgiveness: 93. Where Is The Line?: 94. Vokuro: 55. Oll Birtan: 66. Who Is It: 87. Oceania: 78. Submarine: 69. Sonnets/Unrealities XI: 410. Desired Constellation 911. Ancestors: 112. Mouths Cradle: 1013. Mivikudags: 814. Triumph Of A Heart: 8
2,Definitely not her best work.,"What was she thinking? It seems like every band/artist has this period where they let the art get in their way of making great music. I definitely think that it's necessary for an artist to evolve and change with the times in order to have a prolonged career, but Bjork's dive into the artistic doesn't do her justice. There are a few great tracks on this album, but fot the most part it's disappointing. I eagerly anticipated this album, as I am, without a doubt, a fan of Bjork's music. However, I cannot help but feel like it was a waste of my $15."
3,"ok, not great","i liked it at first, then 3rd/4th time listening to it, it got more boring. the best tracks so far are Pleasure is all Mine, Oceania, and Desired Constellation, (which she played in her 2003 tour). It's definitely not as catchy as her older stuff, but i still like it better than vespertine, medulla's definitlely darker/more interesting/a lot of guts. It's still got that IDM/electronic flair, but I don't think she's gonna turn any pop similar to bachelorette anytime soon. If all the voices are replaced with real instruments, i don't think it'd sound that ""experimental"". 'Sonnets & mouths cradle' are below mediocre though- i changed my rating of the overall album from 'good' to 'fair' based on those songs- ."
3,Very good but not great...3.5/5.00,"Bjork is back with nothing but human vocals. Medulla is Bjork's most accessible and challenging album she ever release but does it succeed in a way her other albums have? Almost but not quite. Sure there some amazing songs on this album like the sensual, haunting slow-paced album opener ""Pleasure Is All Mine""; the dark apocalyptic march of ""Where Is The Line?""; and the school fish filled sea, ""Oceania"". But for the rest of the album which is mostly Bjork singing on her own, the musical instruments are sorely missed. Among them some tracks are too short and incomplete. Bjork's voice is lost under the dominant choirs, the muddy beatbox, her own vocal layerings, and the dissonance. Overall it's a good experimental album but not as satisfying as her previous works."
2,Experimental,"The word 'Experimental' summs up this album. Interesting maybe, but lack of melody, distracts from the Bjork known and followed by many. I was dissappointed with the album - 'big time'. If it was not for the fact that Bjork was doing something original I would have given 1 or zero stars - because pushing the boundaries is what makes for interesting stuff. Its just this is so appallingly bad that I can never get through a single track without thinking - 'oh my goodness my dog sings better than this'. Hmmmmmmmmmmmm"
5,all is full of love,"ilove bjork i have all the cd and dvd collections so when i first listened to this cd i didnt immediately like it b/c its so unlike anything else she has done, but i continued to play it and it grows on you amazingly well. i can understand what she was trying to do with this album, she has such a powerful voice why not just make an album of voices. this album is not for the person who is just begining to listen to bjork though, overall i give it an A+."
1,If there was an option for zero stars this would have been.,"Wow, I listened to this album and could not get over how EXTREMELY booooooooring it is. Yes Bjork does have a nice voice, but by the end of the album I don';t think I can listen it again for a very very long time. I highly do NOT recomend buying this album."
2,"High concept, poor product","This is a high concept album that ends up being hard to listen to, in my opinion. The gasping, sighing, and painful moaning make for an irritating listening experience on some tracks. There are a few great songs here, but even they can annoy when listened to with headphones where each gasp and lip-kazoo-sound is clearer and sounds more silly. The final track stands out, but when I listened to it with headphones for the first time, I really noticed the cat ""Mew! Mew!"" noises and men doing bad immitations of trombones. Yuck. Don't listen too closely to this album or the overall effect could be ruined."
1,She's gone mad.,"She must think this is very arty, but it's excruciating to listen to as music. It sounds like a soundtrack from a nutter asylum. Very boring -- actually worse than watching paint dry."
2,Atonal music that sounds too much the same,"I just had to counter all the exalted reviews of this recording. I found that I can't differentiate most of the pieces and just start tuning the entire album out eventually. I like other Bjork recordings, but this one is just too far out there for my taste. If you like the weirder parts of Vespertine (which I liked overall) then you'll probably enjoy it."
4,Fearless creativity,"As always, Bjork has no fear in experimenting within her art. Here is another step of Bjork's musical exploration - ""Medulla"". To me definite highlights of this album are ""Pleasure is all mine"" and ""Oceania"" (I only wish they were a bit longer). ""Where is the line?"", ""Who is it"" and ""Desired constellations"" are also striking. However, I think the second half of this CD is less interesting and sounds more like creative exercises rather than complete finished ideas. Nevertheless, this artist keeps surprising us with her true originality and unique world!"
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I have always loved Bjork. Loved her in the Sugarcubes and I've followed her solo career buying every album or remix I could get my hands on. When I heard that she was making an 'experimental vocal' album I was a little thrown off but had faith in her 100%. Upon finally hearing the long awaited Medulla I was met with total disappointment. 2 good songs 'Oceania' and 'who is it' then you're stuck with a bunch of filler. Does experimental have to be this painfully boring and uninspired?? King Crimson, Squarepusher, Anodyne, Doves, have all 'experimented'.The only difference is that they don't put you to sleep like Medulla manages to do. I'm a lover of art but this is a self serving album. It certainly shows.Get out the strings and the drum machine pleasestart making decent albums again like Post or HomogenicDisappointment of the year =("
5,"""Medulla"" is beautiful and amazing","If I could I would give it more than 5 stars. It's gorgeous! Before buying this in September, I wasn't a fan of Bjork. I definately knew who she was and respected her work but this was my first purchase from her. Because of this her lack of instruments and use of vocals, it needs repeated plays to grow on you. But it DOES!! The albums flows fabulously and albums flow even better. The 14 songs keep you wanting more and i pray she delivers more of this type of music stylings in the future.>Favorite Songs: ""Mouth's Cradle"", ""Desired Constellation"", ""Oceania"", ""Who Is It?"""
1,What happened??!?,"After all these years of being a Bjork fan, for the first time since she released her album Debut, I absolutely hate her work. It's just a recording of strange noises as she attempts to make her voice sound musical. I give this album 1 star cos there's no half star! :("
2,Avante Garde= Avn'te Got A Clue,"Pretentious/ambitious art does not always equal great art. There are some great moments in this album like Triumph of a Heart, Who Is It, Pleasure Is All Mine; but mostly it's too high minded to be accessible (which is undeniably important in art).A listening equivalent could be John Coltrane's late 60's albums, such as Interstellar Space; music that many music snobs will unflappably rave about but, rarely will you catch them actually listening to it.Same goes for Medulla. This is music that most fans will force themselves to listen to and appreciate because... it's Bjork."
3,Bjork paints a picture...,"I admire this album. I don't love it or hate it. I just admire it. To me, this album is like a canvas speckled with many different moods. I don't think of this as music anymore.My favorite song is definitely Oceania, but I also like what the Pleasure Is All Mine and Who is it evokes in me. Good job!Unfortunately one cannot enjoy a painting when one is driving in their vehicle."
1,nope :(,"this cd has about 2-3 good songs on it and if that's worth the cost to you, good luck.the style is definitely new, but still feels like bjork. it's not a total letdown, but i would try to hack this off the web instead of paying for it. most of this is pretty bad... if you liked ""post"" or ""homogenic"" do not get this. this is about 25% better than vespertine.-cwc."
1,O_O,"....Bjork scares me. She's such a freak. Why do people like her? She's the Tom Green of music, liked for her utter weirdness. This sounds like music from a greasy, quirky demon from the bowls of Hell. Her voice is really annoying, she's like whining and screaming and crying. The fact that there is NO background music makes this worse. If you're ever in the mood for Bjork, scratch your nails across a chalk board, it's the same thing, it will likely satisfy the disturbing urge that won't last long anyway."
1,the worst CD I've ever heard from a normally good artist,"What a mistake this album was! Where are the beats? Bjork got famous for her beats, the sampled cool drums and stuff like from ""Human Behaviour"" and ""Army of Me"", I love those tracks. Her album ""Post"" is her best in my opinion, because mainly of its great beats. THis album has no beats! Talented singers need instruments backing'em up, otherwise the melodies are just boring! The whole album reminds me of the song ""Tom's Diner"" from Suzanne Vega, I wanted the remix and bought the album only to find that the whole song had no instruments backing it up. Songs suck like that! Don't you dare buy this CD. If you want Bjork's best, look no further than ""Post"" and ""Debut"", they are the most creative. This CD is probably the worst I've ever heard, the only song with a real beat is the last track, and it's rather strange too."
1,Is she on crack?,"Honey, when I saw this white girl in that swan gown at the Oscars, I knew there was something NOT RIGHT about Bjork. She's crazy! This record is too weird. It's like listening to a Bobby McFerrin CD on some potent drugs. Is Miss Thing smoking crack? Somebody betta tell her that it kills! Chile, this mess really freaked me out. THUMBS DOWN."
2,"Not her best,at all","in my opinion this is her worst album.its just doesnt come close to ""Homogenic"" or even ""Vespertine"",there are a few good songs,""Who is it"" is the highlight of the album,""Desired Constellation"" is good,""Triumph of a heart"" ""Oceania"" and thats about it.if you are someone who hasnt listened to Bjork and you want to,dont start with this album,it will probabaly dissapont you,listen to ""Post"" and ""Homogenic"""
4,Great multi-channel SACD,"I recommned this as a great multi-channel experience. The music is very unique and will not suit everyone's taste. It did grow on me after repeated listenings and I continue to marvel at it. It has a drier than usual sound for SACD, a bit less air, but is for me an outstanding use of multi-channels for music, virtually acapella no less. I really like Bjork's voice, especially her range and the uniqueness of her sound. This is certainly one of her more unusual outings."
2,Rating for the limited edition,"I reviewed the standard issue of ""MedÃºlla"" already. This review is purely for the purpose of talking about the Limited Edition. I wasn't too impressed with it, because the lyrics are printed on the same paper as the poster (which is only the same photo as the cover), so if you want to read the lyrics, you'd have to take down the poster to do it. I know you can look online or whatever, but I just think it's not practical.The case was like her greates hits one, just a two-sided digipak. The sleeve for the CD probably doesn't protect it that much, I liked the case of the Homogenic limited edition."
3,An ambitious effort with mixed results,"Bjork's least accessible album. Certain tracks seem dull and lifeless, despite their unique a-capella qualities (i.e. ""Ancestors""). Songs such as ""Mother Oceania"" and ""The Triumph of the Heart"" use human voices and sound programming to much better affect. The other material falls somewhere in between."
5,Musical Talent Way Over My Head,"I love Bjork because every album she puts out is different from the one before. She has no two albums that sound alike. If this isn't proof of true talent (musically and as an artist in general), I don't know what is. The only problem with this album I think is that she outdid herself. Her musical talent is so great that it's over my head, and probably several other people who listen to her music. If you like all of her albums, you will like this one. It has a lot of harmonies, and choirs but very little instrumental background. But I will warn you that it is very different from everything else you've heard from her."
3,"Those new to Bjork, don't make this your first album!","Unless you're game for an experimental choral piece, do not let Medula be your introduction to Bjork's music. This is easily her most challenging and inaccessible work. Already a Bjork fan? Just go ahead and buy this. You know you're going to eventually. I'm assuming it will grow on me with repeated listening.Obligitory disclaimer: I am a Bjork fan. I adore her. I own just about everything she's produced; books, dvds, cds."
4,Medulla Oblangata,"I was MOST impressed with this Bjork release. I had no knowledge of how the album was made, or what its composition was before I picked it up. I can say that I have never heard such wonderful and experimental music made with the human voice. Of course, Bjorks' lyrics are ""poetry"" or ""arty"" as other reviewers have said; she does have an ""indie"" fanbase. But regardless of one's opinion on her artistic merit, this album fits beautifully in her discography, and should be championed as one of the greatest records to reach a mass audience since Radiohead's ""Kid A"".The only reason that I give this album, which I consider one of Bjorks' best, four stars instead of five is that this release maintains an air of positivity. I like evil ambience, heavy, claustrophobic sense of dread. Still, ""Medulla"" is by far in the top ten CD's of the year."
2,noise,"I love Bjork (especially Debut Bjork), and I was so happy to hear Bjork's out with a new album, but it's just sounds like a whining tori amos in an Icelandic accent.buy it for the collection, not really for listening."
5,WOW! WOW! WOW! WOW!,"Constellation, Oceania, Who Is It, Triumph Of A Heart, Mouth's Cradle, Where Is The Line, Submarine -- these are amazing songs, incredibly good. Very tender, intimate, sonorous, filled with gorgeous harmonies, delicious textures, vast landscapes. But, Ancestors is my favorite track. It's devastating, disastrous, disgusting. It's the birth and death of music, the meaning of life, the reason why there are sounds and subtance in the first place. It's more beautiful than any other single song I can think of. I cannot recommend this disc highly enough."
4,It strikes me as funny...,"... that people are always complaining every time BjÃ¶rk changes her style. I'd assume that's the very reason why you'd become a fan of BjÃ¶rk in the first place. In spite of the latent hypocrisy in BjÃ¶rk's ""fans,"" this is once again a charming, hypnotic, and powerful listen, and gives an example the rest of the hopelessly stagnant music industry should learn from."
4,Cool,"This album is cool. Its inconsistent, not completey successful, and definitely not very refined, though I don't think that's Bjork's thing, exactly.However, it does have a handful of tracks which are just too high on the cool meter for me to give a lesser rating. Their coolness is kinda associated with novelty though, which fades, and admittedly I haven't listened to the album in a few months, but its totally worth checking out, especially if you have a bit of an open mind."
2,Huge disappointment,"I'm going to be brief. I love Bjork's earlier music, even Vespertine. I welcome her experimentation, but here, I find her experiment to have failed. This album is not enjoyable to me in the least. I was so excited for this new album from one of my favorite artists that I didn't mind getting ripped off by an expensive CD store just so I could have it immediately. Boy do I feel ripped off now. Listen to this one before you consider buying it."
1,Its not her voice..its the electronica stuff that we love!,"All these bandwagon type loyal fans putting in their hopeful 2 cents. It just makes me ill. Ive heard this album at the record store, I was thoroughly disappointed. No trade-mark electronica style music that we all know her for. Vespertine was awesome! I was looking forward to hearing more harmonic, beutiful, and innovative songs. But this album seems like she went on a camping trip with some drugged up natives and never came back. Why Bjork!.........Why!!!!!!!!"
1,Great sounding crap,"IF YOU BUY THIS ALBUM, THIS ""DUAL DISC"" IS DEFINETLY THE ONE TO BUY.One side is a compact disc, and the other side is a DVD with the music in 5.1.The sound quality of the CD is excellent. It is one of the best sounding CDs I have heard. The sound quality of the DVD is amazing and the 5.1 system is used to its fullest. It is the best 5.1 mix I have heard.Unfortunately, the music is a bunch of crap. Think Yoko Ono gone Icelandic. There is lots of screaming, heavy panting and other wierd noises coming from Bjork and her backup singers.I like Bjork pushing the boundaries, but this time I think she went over the edge."
3,DOES THIS HELP?,"Dance to it: 2Weirdness: 10Catchiness: 3Originality: 10Abrasiveness: 3Self Indulgence: 10Experimentation: 10Desperation: 1Believability: 9Darkness: 7Hardcore-ness: 1Cover Art: 10Genre Purity: 1Offensiveness: 1Accessibility: 2Notes: Includes appearances by Rahzel, and Mike Patton (unrecognizable) as well as various choirs, beat boxers, and throat singers--artistically intact, though consistently antisocial and occasionally down right unpleasant"
4,Her voice carries the album.,"When I first heard Bjork was releasing this album I expected pure vocals with minimal instruments, very acapella. Well this record is almost that except for the fact that she has created a wall of sound entirely consisting of vocals, sonic manipulations and simple beats. A logical and utterly thrilling next step after Vespertine Bjork is creating a catalogue of albums that will be looked back upon and seen as groundbreaking and important as artists such as the Beatles, Velvet Underground, Underworld, Nirvana, U2 and others. A truly unique and evolving artist."
2,Not what I expected from Bjork :(,"I figured as long as I'm a big fan of Bjork, have been since she was in SugarCubes, by now her albums would sound better and better. I was wrong. I was excited to find her new album out. I just got it today and listened to it with a grimace face. It was that sour. Too many up and down voices from the ""Extra"" choir that she has in the background of many of the songs, like in the song ""Oceania"". It made it sound way too cheesy, almost like she was trying too hard to make the music sound unique. Very disappointed with ""Medulla""."
4,Abstract Emotion.,"Bjork returns with vocal layers, loops and distortions to comprise 14 tracks for ""Medulla"". It sounds more novel than it actually is when you hear it. In fact, ""Medulla"" is quite musically similar to ""Vespertine"". My favorite tracks are the more traditional Bjork songs ""Who Is It"" and ""Triumph Of A Heart"" (which are the only two upbeat tracks). The other 12 songs are dreamy and vocally layered to high heaven. ""Medulla"" puts Bjork next to other creative geniuses Laurie Anderson, Sheila Chandra, Patti Smith and Marianne Faithfull. It's worth a listen if you're a casual fan, and worth a purchase if you are like me--a long-time fan."
5,Excellent product,I love ti I expect only one vinyl but I got two in the same product so I am happy with it thanks amazon ur doing great always and once again thanks
2,I can make those noises with my mouth too!,"An album with no instuments, just noise from people's mouths gets annoying after a while. Nothing on this album stands out. I wanted to shoot my CD player after a couple of songs, but that would be violent, so I didn't do it. Don't buy this, get something older from Bjork or her best of. She's fallen off her rocker and nobody is helping her up."
1,A Dud,"Rarely would I ever rate a musician so low, that I normally would enjoy SO MUCH.Bjork, you have disappointed this fan. When It became news that ""Medulla"" were to be made strictly by human utterance (completely vocal) I was hoping for a strikingly different release.Well, I was right about one thing: this release IS striking. Strikingly BAD. I have never heard anything so over-produced and lifeless being released by Bjork, or any number of other artists of similar taste, for that matter.The beats are overdone, the harmonies overdone or lacking. I feel if this album was stripped down of the noisy and ANNOYING voice-overlays, you might just have a Gem.Desired Constellation is the only good track- so 1 star for this album."
4,Listen to it before you judge it,"This is one of the harder albums to review. You can read all these posts here, but I highly suggest listening to BjÃ¶rk's new album before judging it. Here, you're only going to read reviews based on personal opinions and it's definitely more along the lines of contemporary classical in nature. For those looking for pop music, go elsewhere. For those interested in music as an artform and her soundscapes as somewhere to sit back and immerse yourself in, then give it a go.Check MedÃºlla out if you are open to new styles of music - if you like stuff like Radiohead, experimental, electronic, industrial, or ambient - but if you're looking for more ""Army of Me,"" look elsewhere. This is intelligent music."
2,Eccentric indulgance,"This vocal-driven experiment falls flat with little songwriting substance to back up all the choral gimmickry. A few interesting textural properties are to be found throughout, but will only be for the adventurous to sift through in an otherwise pretentious project."
5,"Ahhh, Bjork.....","If you have no idea who Bjork is, then listen to her album's Debut and Homogenic. These will introduce you to her world.... She is not easy to describe, but most people say that she is in the pop/dance/avant garde area. With that being said, Bjork also likes to experiment in each and every one of her albums. With Medulla, the whole CD is an experiment. Not that it's a bad thing. If you are a true fan of Bjork, (like me) then you will love this album. On the other hand, if you are a casual listener, you will probably get lost from the first song. In any event, Bjork can sing, and I do mean SING. On top of that, in every album she writes most of her music, arranges the instruments, produces her music, and is not afraid to go all out. How many artist's can do all of that nowadays?! (Very few.) Which is why I LOVE Bjork. An original artist, ALWAYS."
5,For the die-hard Bjork fan.....,"Ok, Yes, This is by for the most shocking Bjork to date.. At first I hated this album..Although, after listening to it several times I still get lost in her voice and her music.. Sometimes I feel like I am listening to this album underwater.. All in all..I still go to that place when I listen to Bjork's voice...and its a wonderful place to be....."
4,Stay away if you're not into experimental music,"I've been listening to BjÃ¶rk for a long time and it was just plain difficult to understand and like this CD. If you want to get into BjÃ¶rk's music this is not the place to begin, try listening her albums in a chronological order.Now onto MedÃºlla: you won't hear a traditional musical instrument here. Must of the music is made out of voices, sometimes it sounds great, sometimes it sounds just strange and, yes, sometimes you feel like something is missing. Anyway, there are many musicians out there that never assume a risk and just stick to a successful formula, and that's mediocre.Perhaps BjÃ¶rk was influenced by Matmos when doing Vespertine, and she deserves some credit by taking this direction with her music.It's hard to describe how this music sounds, you have to hear it by yourself. Just give it a try before you buy it, because you may be disappointed even if you have liked BjÃ¶rk's previous albums."
3,the beautiful and the strange,"When Monet's ""Waterlilies"" came out, even it was considered radical, but now it's accepted in every cubical across America. Same goes with music, so looking at it from that respect Medulla's uniqueness shouldn't cloud the actual sounds coming from it. I think most of the album is totally listenable, and impressive. Granted I DO get uncomfortable when listening to ""Ancestors."" It is self-absorbed and extremely expressive . . . but hey, isn't that the whole point of art, to release something from within in a new abstracted form???If you haven't bought Medulla yet and are curious, go for it! Bjork didn't just make an album to please the market, she made one to please herself, and that is what makes it intriguing. It is music drawn from her depths. Medulla is definately one to listen to alone on your headphones, NOT with your family in the mini-van!"
2,start cringing,"before i say the unpositive things i am about to say about this album, let me say that i really like most of bjork's music. she has been tickling my ears with the most unusual yet listenable pop since her first albums with the sugarcubes, and while i have come to expect something different from each subsequent effort, i could always count on being seduced each time. which is why i was so disappointed with ""medulla"". i know. she's being an artist. she's pushing the envelope. she's broadening my tastes. no, she was just trying my patience. track after track of waiting for the song to get good, but having to skip forward out of shear aural irritation. i'm sure there are people for whom this album will be just the sort of thing they've been longing for, but for me it will probably be the last bjork album i buy without listening first."
3,What happened to Bjork?,"I think she completely flipped out here. Maybe she got sick of working with MATMOS, or vice versa. I still like her voice, and it's still in top shape, but I can't stand any back-up music consisting only of idiots beat-boxing. BARF. If you can get past that, you might like it. Personally, I found most of the arrangements downright annoying."
5,Bjork's Echo,"Over the past few years I have gotten deeper into Bjork's material. Before that I enjoyed the cuts MTV played. I was waiting for Medulla and rushed out to purchase it. When I played it, it sounded like a lullaby for adults. I played it over and over to let it go under the surface. Oceania and Who Is It for example, sound like far-off penetrating voices calling you, drawing you in. I tried playing this CD at bedtime and it was so relaxing and enjoyable. Bjork has a beautiful voice; she knows who she is and she is an artiste."
3,Bjork is good.,"Medulla is different to the other albums from bjork, but for me, not in the right way. In this LP she worked voices and she achieved a good job in that part, but the music has not depth, is like record a song from the tv. I think that Homogenic is her best Album."
1,Over the Edge,"Bjork, having achieved momentary diva pop stardom, is doing everything in her power to erode her fan base. This self-indulgent waste of time will be available soon for $1.35 as merchants attempt to recover their investment. A classic example of the ""Emporer's New Clothes"" story in real life. As the kid finally blurted as the naked Emporer strode through town, ""HE HAS NO CLOTHES ON!!""... Bjork has released an album where ""THERE'S NO MUSIC!!"" Sure, the intelligentsia may gush... but don't be fooled.There is nothing but empty vocals. And I mean nothing. It sounds like she's recording ad lib moments. THAT'S IT. Song after song. It makes you long for the days when she used more conventional instrumentation, like the xylophone made from car exhaust pipes or the Innuit Choir and music box...A collosal waste of time, money, and talent.Re-unite with the Sugarcubes already and forget this lame solo career."
5,"""Rim Job, pull head outta $#@ and learn to spell""...","When I first bought this new Medulla cd, I thought it strangeas hell...but what else should I expect from Bjork? Afterhurricanes and such here in FLA, I forgot about it. I took itout and played it again today and I LOVE IT!!! It is such an organic and creative album! Everytime I listened to it sinceI've heard something new. Props to Rahzel, Mike Patton, and allof the vocalists on Medulla! Sorry Rim Job, no cheesy oversampledbeats for ya. You must be from J-ville - home to the FL breaksscene that hasnt changed in 10 years! I know I suffer here..."
2,Not my kind of music,"Bjork has been playing with her computers again. She is doing science experiments on her vocal samples. And I do like science. But the one thing Bjork hasn't done for this album is make music.Bjork tricked me into becoming a fan with a few songs she made a long time ago: Bachelorette, Isobel, Hunter, and All Is Love. All I'm saying is, if that's the Bjork you like, skip this album.The old Bjork had melodies, the new Bjork has sound effects."
3,Probably the most honest review on here,"When I purchased 'Medulla,' I was a little skeptical of how it would sound, because personally, I love the beats and many different instruments Bjork uses in most of her music. After hearing Bjork had only used her voice in 'Medulla,' I gotta admit, I wasn't sure it was going to be very good.The first time through listening to Medulla, I was picky, and only listened to Oceania, Who is it, Triumph of a heart, and Where is the line. I found it hard to listen to the other songs that only had singing or very subtle intruments.This CD takes time to grow on you. Which happens to be the most frustrating, yet awesome thing about 'Medulla.' At first you want to give it to the nearest 'CD Shack', but give it a few more listens. Maybe try it when you are going to sleep, or at a party, reading, ect.I can finally put 'Medulla' in my CD player without making any faces or turning the track."
4,Not dissapointed,"I'm a devoted Bjork fan, I even saw her when she came to the Toronto Island, and I have to say that this is a wonderful album. Though it isn't as experimental as I would have liked it has the to-be-expected wonderful vocals and musical compositions, not to mention the wonder of Rahzel doing the bass beats and some effects!If you are a BJork fan you wont be unhappy with this album, but if this is your first Bjork album try Vespertine first, her earlier album, or even homogenic."
4,The Voices Are Here,"Indeed, this album does require its listeners to be open minded, and to put forth a certain effort to understand its complexity, but if you do those things you'll be rewarded with a breath-takingly rich album. First off, this record is freaking odd. That I will not lie about, but it also provides an escape from the typical forms of music, and it sort of brings you into another world, and provides a deeper understanding of what the human vocals are capable of. The fist single ""Oceania"" is literally a sea of voices that swim around Bjork's main vocals. This album essentially focuses on the human voice, with everything from choirs to beat-boxers. This is a innovative album, even for Bjork who is known for her out of the ordinary tunes, but its also creative and I recommend a listen."
2,Pretty Disappointing,"I have been a fan of Bjork for a long time. Each of her other albums were innovative, interesting and somewhat fun. This one sucks pretty bad. It is very boring, I feel like Bjork is focused so much on being ""artistic"" that her music, especially on this CD is becoming unlistenable."
5,~AMAZING~,"This is by far Bjorks best work yet. She trully proves her music ablilities, and shows us how talented she is. Must have for bjork fans.CAUTION: it may need some time to grow on you, but it is well worthit when you really listen. Have fun!"
4,Difficult and Rewarding,"Okay, this album IS hard to digest...BUT, it is a work of art. She didn't make this for fans, for non fans, or for anybody, just herself. She made this all for herself with hopes that everyone else would pull something from it. Many may, many won't. I am in the latter group. There is much I love here, its gothic, pretty, sinister, intense and downright bizarre. It can get a bit much and not something that can be listened to often or in mixed company, but if you light some candles and play loudly on your own and let it sink in and take you away, you will find much to loveThere was a reviewer that stated he didn't like ANY of her albums, but yet with each release still bought them to ""give her a chance"", and surprise surprise HATED this one too, then compared Bjork to Dolly Parton. People, please, if you dislike the first 2 albums of Bjork, don't buy this one, you'll probably hate it."
5,Classic Mambo,"Great stuff, classic Cuban music with the brassy horns and beat. I grew up with the 50's Latin music, Xavier Cugat, Desi Arnez, etc. No studio effects or techno frills , just loud and clean sounds that are missing from todays music. This is a by-gone era of the 40's and 50's Latin in fluence on American culture. My favorite cut is ""Patricia"" with it's ""real"" organ melody. This CD is a real classic piece of music I recomend it to anyone who likes Latin based music and I'm a white dude."
2,Hilariously bad rip-off,"With 250 other GJ cds to choose from this is an easy ""pass"". About 8 of the 10 tracks were clearly copied at the wrong speed. Sounds like someone putting their thumb on the turntable- seriously!The only GJ cd in my 50+ collection I regret purchasing. You've been warned..."
3,It's so-so not worth the amount though,"Pretty much as my title says. The product itself is ""ok"" but i dont think it should be worth 10 dollars. When my rabbit pees on it the balls turn to clay and it is the hardest thing in the world to take off or even wash out. I am also using a litter pan which is plastic and this thing turns into cement when any liquid touches it. Unfortunately i havent been able to find any other type of litter stuff...so this will do. My rabbit stopped using it after a week as a potty and now prefers to lay on it as a bed :/"
3,"Yea, sure.","Yea, sure I mean it's ok. My hamster never uses it though. Except for traveling to the other side. I will train her... definitely. Also, it is all natural so its ok.... but sometimes she eats it! But it is a nice product, if your hamster is trained or you have time to train.."
5,pleased!,very happy to find this online. great stuff and my hamster loves using the potty. happy overall with our shipping experience and the cost too! thank you again for all your help amazon!!!!!
1,Ferret plays in it,"My ferret loves this but for the wrong reason--he thinks its a toy! he plays in it, scattering it everywhere. He now poops ""next"" to the litter pan so he doesnt get his ""play area"" dirty LOL not happy!"
3,Not great,"These clay beads are too dusty for an indoor pet. The bag was ripped open when I received it and there was dust on EVERYTHING. I ended up just throwing out the bag. The last thing I need is for my bunny to be kicking up more dust. Also, when I put a some in his littler box, the wet pearls combined and stuck to the bottom of his pan making it hard to clean."
3,Isn't this just cat litter?,"The hard thing with small pets like hamsters is that everything you read tells you how fragile they are. This may be true, and better safe than sorry in most cases, so I bought this litter for our hamster's cage. We use the Habitrail Ovo Den for the litterbox. The litter comes in a ziplock bag inside of the box, which is nice.This box of litter is pretty small, read the product dimensions and you'll see that it is really only about two cups of litter. Therefore, I expected it to be something special, and at the least I thought it would be non-clumping, as I've read that clumping litter can stop up their digestive tract if swallowed.This litter clumps. It does it's job, but I don't really see any difference between this and normal cat litter, which can be had much more economically. So while this product does its job, I'm not convinced it offers any benefits over cat litter."
1,epic fail,"my gerbils used it as a tunnel, as well as something to nibble. they never used it, was destroyed in a week. make it metal, and i'll be happy."
5,My hamster loves this stuff!,"Ok...so I was skeptical, but my hamster loves this stuff. When I actually fill the little litter box, he is always inside of it. He loves digging in it. He fills it with poo and pee but I think he loves sitting in it best of all! I have one of those open litter boxes but I am going to purchase the closed top one. My hamster kicks it out when he is digging in the open one. I have gone through one box of this. It does last a long time! I believe this hamster is smarter then my dog and learned to use the potty right away. I think the hamster is very smart...everything I seem to show him, he picks up right away. I guess they are much brighter then dogs...LOL. I recommend this litter and the closed litter box!"
4,Potty Litter,"This is the only potty litter we use for our hamster. (:He really likes it and we know it is safe for him to use, the only thing is if you have a hamster that likes to chew on things a lot he may view this as a ""treat"". Our hamster did munch on it when he first got it but it didn't make him sick or anything, which was good. Now, he is more used to it.Suggestion: When spot cleaning try putting some of the ""poops"" in the potty and this will help potty train your hamster faster. (:"
5,Really love this litter,"I was a skeptic, I will admit. I had a hamster years ago and never had to do any of the ""cool"" things being done now. However, I bought two dwarf hamsters for my kids and they actually use this litter! I didn't have to train them at all, I just added the outhouse and voila, it worked. Now, they may still ""leak"" every now and then, but when I cleaned their cage last weekend, there were no wet spots that needed scrubbing (like I used to have to do with my old one). I recommend this litter to any small pet owner.One thing I was confused on is I bought the smaller, cheaper box of litter--which they are small pellets--but when I went for a bigger bag, thinking I could save money, the pellets were a bit bigger and the hamsters seem to not have used it. Not sure if I just didn't read the bigger bag right, or I got the bigger ones by mistake.Either way, I am happy with this product and just bought 4 more boxes :)EDIT: What happened with the price? Skyrocketed a bit, did it not?"
5,worked well,This worked well for my rat girlies. It actually lasted relatively long. Yes I would purchase it again for sure.
4,Film noir nostalgia,"1940s Vocal group that harmonized like a dream and had incomparable Jo Stafford as main vocal - she possessed one of the best voices in the business and honestly was in the same league with Ella Fitzgerald. Because Pipers recorded with young Frank Sinatra in his Tommy Dorsey days,he is also represented here (""Dolores"").Twangy country parody ""Friendship"" precedes Stafford's later recording ""Temptation"" (Tim-Tayshun) (hilarious) and points that behind that serious voice there was a funny person with a big heart. Besides that one exception,the rest of compilation is full of hard swing and misty ballads - very effective in both,The Pied Pipers were absolutely at the top of their game at this time and recorded legacy they left behind is pure magic. Sure,it's old fashioned now,but it's a beautiful film noir nostalgia."
5,favorite 40's music,I have the modernaires and I like this Pied Piper cd even better. Such good harmony and the big band sound.
4,what you get is a bit different than pictured,No corks included.Snake brush is all black. Mouthpiece brush does not have a long white plastic handle--it is a simple wire handle. Works okay.Instructions are vague but you can find what to do online.
4,cHRISTMAS WITH DINAH & FRIENDS,"The highlight of this Cd is hearing a very young Peggy Lee sing a live version of ""The Christmas Song"" and the Dinah Shore tracks are nice(as far as I know Dinah's only Christmas songs). Most of these selections were taken from V-Discs and radio broadcasts. Recommended to jazz vocal buffs as well as casual listers alike."
4,Timely delivery A+++,"Again, I purchased this item shortly before christmas and arrived with plenty of time to enjoy during the season!!!"
5,To Die For Good,"Junket is my fast and easy homemade ice cream solution. The chocolate is rare in stores so it's great to find it here. All you have to do is add 1 3/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup heavy cream to this mix, blend and add to your quart-sized ice cream maker. It's wonderful."
2,"Not for beginers, They move a little to fast I was lost.",At first it was helpful. But by the second CD it was all over the place aDrive Time: Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)nd I could not keep up.
4,slow and easy good beginners lessons,perhaps not advanced enough for someone who has some spanish but for the raw beginner this is a good one - drive listen and learn!
4,Great item!,"Easy to follow even though I am an American. However, I have not yet listened to all CD's, only the first one, but so far it has been easy to understand, and seems to provide constructive learning."
3,Drive Time:Spanish(CD),"When stay long time in traffic the best thing to learn new language. Simple and good game, but not a real lesson."
1,Failure by All New Books to Deliver,"My order with All New Books was placed on 2 December 2009 Two months later (4 Feb 2010) I am still awaiting delivery of the CD ""Drive Time: Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive""I cannot recommend the service received from All New Books."
3,Not for beginners,"This lesson started out at a pace a beginner could manage. After the first two or three sections, though, the pace picked up rapidly and I felt like Lucy in the candy factory. There was no way to keep up or comprehend what was being said, much less learn anything.After listening to the CD's over and over, some words were discernable and the small book helped as a reference. This CD should not be used, however, unless you are intermediate Spanish and need a refresher or more conversational experience."
1,Drive Time Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive,Not very good sound quality and very difficult to understand. The gentleman who narrated did not enunciate well. The format of the questions and conversation did not flow easily like other language CDs I have purchased.
4,Better for non beginners,"I bought this before I had read reviews on it because it was the cheapest cd's you could get.............more bang for the buck. After I read the reviews, I thought woe is me. Sounds like a waste of money to me! Much to my surprise, I really am using it. It's in my car of course, and I run the cd's over and over again. They seem a bit past me, but they are extremely helpful and well worth the little money that it is. My only complaint is that they don't give you much time to repeat occasionally. Plus sometimes they don't translate some of the conversations, expect you to know it I suppose. Still despite these complaints which may loom large to some, I find myself really getting a lot out of these cd's and recommend them to anyone from advanced beginners, intermediate to advanced. And the price is right!UPDATE I have since learned that it is necessary to use more than one program so now I have several programs and I use them all while driving around and going places."
1,spanish,"the first cd was good, the second went to major grammer and was difficult to learn from. would not recommend this for beginners."
2,Impossible to follow,"CD 1 starts off great! The speaker reviews words over and over, and they're used in sentences repeatedly. It moves nice and slow, which is valuable when you're trying to drive (Drive Time...)By CD2 they quit the repetition, and they speak the words so quickly, there's absolutely no hope of keeping up.I gave up"
5,Wonderful!,"This is a wonderful item! Down comforters were always too warm for me, and this turned out to be perfect. I highly reccomend it."
2,loved the cost but not the feathers!,"Bought this for my husband and we both initially loved the lightness of it, the low cost and the softness. However, I am going to return it because the feathers ""leak"" out way too much even though it says it is leakproof."
2,Disappointed,"This blanket is made with a very crisp, stiff fabric (no doubt used to prevent the down from leaking through). Maybe washing will help, but I thought it would be softer and plumper than it is, for the price paid."
3,Not as Soft Expected,"This down blanket is an excellent value but it isn't as soft as I expected. The fabric is somewhat stiff and makes a lot of noise. Hopefully, this will improve after it is washed."
1,terrible,I purchased this blanket because I loved the color. That is the only thing it has going for it. There were feathers all over the place and I keep finding random ones in rooms on different floors! It is now stored in an airtight bag because I can't toss it- I paid good money for it.
2,Watch Out for First Look Home Entertainment Version,"This is the version I got stuck with. Completely linear. No chapters, no menus, no special features, but a decent transfer of FULL FRAME Version. Hit the menu button or chapter advance and you start the whole movie over. May as well be VHS. Buyers beware! Ask your sellers which version your getting. Too bad because this is a fun film."
4,Technical minor point,"Good film but the version Amazon.ca is selling is not widescreen. It starts off in the widescreen format but that lasts about a minute during the opening credits and for the rest of the film, except for the end credits, it's in the full frame/standard format."
1,Blather,"I was actually looking forward to reading this, but invariably it degenerated into the knee-jerk anti-war rhetoric which while emotionally satisfying, is less than useful from a rational assessment of the war's consequences.More specifically the musings of such international relations luminaries such as Viggo Mortensen and Ambassador Joe Wilson give this book a decidedly ideological rather than critical/academic analysis. If that's what you want, then you'll love the book.If however you want something a bit more intellectually satisfying, try ""Cobra II"" or ""Fiasco."""
1,Wow,"In reading this collection one would think that the US intends to plunder and pillage Iraq while at the same time destroying their social, economic, and political fabric. We are responsible for their treatment of women, poor economic choices, Saddam's palaces, and the destruction of the World Trade Center. This is complete left-wing drivle that uses blinders only to exploit negative events and completely ignore anything positive occuring in Iraq today. If you're looking for an objective review of conditions in Iraq today stay clear of this one."
5,The Best Book on Fatherhood I've Ever Read,"This book is truly a masterpiece of thought. It takes fatherhood full circle, from the moment you hold your first child in your arms, to mentoring your grandchildren as you watch them grow and mature. This book is comprehensive in its content and practical in its application. I would highly recommend it for fathers in every stage of life. Grandfathers will have the joy of reliving their early days of fatherhood, while young fathers will find in these pages a wealth of preparation for the future. It is an easy and enjoyable read and will captivate you from the very first lines."
2,This recording falls flat,"After seeing the production of Cabaret at Studio 54, I eagerly purchased the revival recording. I was disappointed when I listened to it, however. The voices I heard live were much stronger and more expressive than those on the recording. I was particularly disappointed by Natasha Richardson's tracks - after seeing Joely Fisher give a moving performance with great expression (not to mention vocal ability), Richardson's Sally doesn't measure up."
3,Good but not amazing,"I recently saw the show in New York and was blown away, particularly by Alan Cumming's performance. After having heard the CD, I was grateful Natasha Richardson was no longer in the show. While her replacement was not a great actress, her voice was far superior- and - let's not forget, it;s a musical! Hearing Natasha sing Cabaret on the disc is heartbreaking (because she kills the song). I know Sally Bowles was not meant to be a great singer- but I find some of Natasha's songs virtually unlistenable. This is a shame because the rest of the CD is terrific and brought back great memories of a truly amazing night at the theatre."
4,"Natasha, not so good","Ms. Richardson sounds like a cat with a tin can tied to its tail. Otherwise, it is a good soundtrack"
2,I didn't see the show,"But I am a big fan of the music. While I get the fact that Sally Bowles is supposed to be second-rate and I'm all for doing Cabaret as realistically as possible, I still find it extremely difficult to listen to Natasha's Richardson's singing. I just can't figure out why one would voluntarily subject oneself to something so terrible and painful to listen to. The patrons of the ""real"" Kit Kat Club were obviously really drunk and depressed while listening to Sally Bowles, but I'm not prepared to get wasted every time I want to listen to the music of Cabaret. I don't doubt that Natasha Richardson was great in the role, but maybe it was necessary to see her in the the show to derive pleasure from her songs here.Everyone else is fine."
3,"""Cabaret"" revival","We are actually performing this show at TMCC (Truckee Meadows Community College, Reno NV) next month, so I purchased this CD for reference. For those only familiar with the Liza Minelli movie, the play itself is very different. There are some good songs by Kander and Ebb and Alan Cumming does a wonderful job as the Emcee. Natasha Richardson cannot vocally compare to Liza Minelli; however, on stage, perhaps this served her well to better embody a Sally Bowles who sings in a tawdry Berlin cabaret. For the most part, although I am performing in it, it is not a show I would care to see, and I am not so fond of the music that I'll listen to the CD after the show is over. As a matter of fact, our music director asked us to stop listening to it since it is different from the actually score we have."
4,Great Recording,"Alan Cumming as Emcee, is great. And the new musical arrangements, are great. It's amazing what can you do with an old show, like CABARET."
4,Second Only to the Live Show,"I loved it! After seeing the show in SF for the upteenth time yesterday, I finally bought the recording. I can't get enough of the Cabaret music, especially Wilkommen, Don't Tell Mama, and Mein Herr. The best song by far is the title song, Cabaret. My only complaint was that they didn't make a review of the touring company. We got to see Andrea McArdle (the original Annie on Broadway) perform as Sally Bowles, and I much prefer her singing style to Natasha Richardson's. The verdict: this is definitely a must for all musical theatre buffs. Like all good cast recordings, it's second only to the live show!"
4,Alun Cumming is Fabulous,"Cabaret is a fabulous show, not for everyone and of course you must be in for something risque if you want to see it, but if you are ok with risque, it's a fabulous show.Alun Cumming is the worlds most fabulous Emcee, I think better than Joel Grey, but Joel Grey will go on in history. Alun Cumming has crazy little expressions and is so expressive and hilarious!Natasha Richardson as Sally Bowles. Since Sally is a dream role of mine, I'm critical of those who play Sally. I'm not really a fab of Natasha's voice it doesn't have the night clubbish sound that Sally's voice should have and her version of Mein Herr could have more energy, but all in all she's just okay."
5,"An Excellent CD, Cabaret with an Edge","I have listend to the original Broadway recording on LP many times. I recently rented the video, and found myself wondering how it did so well. It hasn't aged well. The new revival is outstanding. Natasha Richardson may be the best Sally Bowles yet. Buy this CD, and leave your troubles outside."
4,Fine record of the show...,"If you like ""Cabaret"" (the stage version) you'll love this recording. The technical quality is quite good. Last night I had the great pleasure of seeing the touring company with Ann Shindle as ""Sally"". What a joy! Who knew that Miss America '98 could belt out songs. She deserved the standing ovation! Anyway, it made me get out the CD again and I was amazed at how well it stands up to a comparison with the live performance. You'll not be disappointed."
5,Great cast breathes new life into classic of depravity.,"While there was nothing wrong with the original 1966 cast album, something had to be done to restore the memory of Sally Bowles. Natasha Richardson understands this sad, self-obsessed dreamgirl in ways Liza Minnelli simply could not and proves a talented, nuanced singer (as did her accomplished mother Vanessa Redgrave). But the real star here is Alan Cumming, whose seizure of the role of the emcee from Joel Grey is nothing short of grand larceny. The change from sinister to sexual was a good one; it finally gives this character humanity, rather than comic relief or story moving. His wicked, self-consciously decadent performance will become a standard to which actors will spend years trying to match. Mary Louise Wilson is also fine support as Fraulein Schneider; the arrangements are crisp and though going back some 60 years, feel eerily modern. Depravity never looked, or sounded, so good"
4,I LIke It BUT.....,"I already knew I would like this CD from my favorite musical of all time because I already had it on casette. Problem is the copy I got is defective. In fairness, the seller sent me a personal email to tell me if I had any problem with it let him know. Now I wonder if he has had problems in the past that is why he said that. I was saving it for a special occasion, and being it was new and factory sealed I thought I was safe. When I finally used it, it skipped and didn't play right. Since it has been weeks since I got it and it would cost more to ship it back than it is worth, I am not contacting the seller. In the future,I will pay a little more and buy products only directly from Amazon."
4,Great and Good,"Harper is a classic Private Investigator film, a noir for the sixties, mostly overlooked and/or undervalued by critics when it was initially released.It all starts with the word, and this is adapted from Ross MacDonald's first Lew Archer novel (if you've never read him, I heartily recommend all of his books. Read in chronological order, he got better with each one). William Goldman fashioned the script, and a splendid cast drives it home. Even the Johnny Mandel score is entertaining.About ten years later Newman revisited the character, with slightly lesser results. I enjoyed ""The Drowning Pool"" when it was released in 1975, and did not repeat the experience until last year. Again, a great cast with the underrated Richard Jaeckel and Melanie Griffith at her most insolent and voluptuous jailbait best (similar to her role in another nearly forgotten P I film, ""Night Moves."")If you're a Newman fan you should have these."
5,An excellent collection of academic perspectives on vampires,"If you are interested in getting behind the fiction to the facts of vampires, this is an excellent place to start. The collection of scholars who wrote essays for this volume come from anthropology as well as psychiatry, with historians as well as students of Slavic culture. Consequently, you are bound to find one perspective on vampires that will suit your personal inclinations. More importantly, taken as a whole the book provides a broad spectrum of academic study of the popular phenomenon."
4,Great guide for healthy eating,"I have a well-worn copy of the first cookbook by Jennifer Raymond and knew that her recipes were relatively simple to prepare and very tasty. The Peaceful Palate includes a nice variety of offerings, without a lot of exotic (hard to find) ingredients. This would be a good book for anyone who wants to experiment with vegetarian cuisine to improve their eating habits. The Intro section of the book includes a lot of useful info, including items to stock, suggested menus and other tips on healthy eating."
5,Reliably delicious and relatively easy to prepare,"I picked up this cookbook several years ago at a vegetarian food festival. I have several great cookbooks, but I find myself checking this one first most of the time, because the recipes always turn out great. Everything I've made from this cookbook has been delicious. Highly recommended for new vegetarians/vegans and anyone looking to add a great, healthy cookbook to their collection."
5,My favorite veg cookbook of all time,"I have a lot of vegan cookbooks, and this one remains my all-time favorite. It's classic. The recipes are easy, and the ingredients are likely already in your pantry. I have given this book as a gift multiple times. The book may be especially helpful for those who are cooking vegan for the first time, but it's a must-have for long-term vegans as well. One feature I like (among many) is that for some recipes the author provides alternative cooking methods for readers who use slow cookers. Buy this book. You'll turn to it again and again, I promise."
3,Not what I expected,"I have quite a few vegan cookbooks in my cabinet now. Sadly this was a disappointment. I hopes to get some really great and simple vegan ideas for family dinners. This was not out of the ordinary. There was not anything in this book I couldn't easily find online or in my other books. No pictures either. Given the chance, I would not buy this again."
3,A somewhat good but outdated cook book,"this was a good basic vegetarian cook book. In it's day it was a breakthrough, somewhat outdated now with some of the newer books."
1,Mistake on my part,"This might be a good buy for an established vegetarian, but not for someone who wants to add more vegetables to their diet. A lot of recipies call for many (up to 10) ingredients, some of which are not commonly used. Why should I buy rice vinegar, cider vinegar, buckwheat flour, or something called tahini just to try it in one recipe. I am not saying the recipes are bad, they just look intimidating."
5,Great book!,"This was the first cookbook I found upon deciding to become a vegan; I consider this to be a stroke of great luck. Ms. Raymond does a fantastic job of setting you up for healthful cooking: She helps you stock your pantry, explains foods which might be new to a beginning vegetarian, gives nutrition information, and included a cornucopia of easy and delicious recipes. She does not rely on attempts at mimicking foods which contain animal products, but supplies foods which stand easily on their own two feet. Even I, a kitchen klutz, get excited every time I open the book. A must for any kitchen, vegetarian or no."
3,Readable but a bit flimsy,"While this is a serviceable account of World War II, it adds nothing new to the many one-volume histories that have been published in recent years. It is popular, not scholarly, with no footnotes. The book's priorities are old-fashioned, with the Eastern Front (where Germany committed two-thirds of its strength) being disposed of in one chapter and a few subsequent sections. The analysis and the prose are competent but hardly outstanding. I can see no reason to recommend this book over the much more comprehensive and thoughtful ""A World at Arms"" by Gerhard Weinberg"
3,good but disappointing,"Some sections were well done; I learned a lot about Italy's involvement and the Balkan campaign for example. However, given the rave reviews I had read, I wanted much more than I got. There is much that is standard fare such as the coverage of the Battle of the Atlantic which completely ignores the questions Clay Blair raised in his recent books about German effectiveness and American mismanagement. Also the authors don't seem to think much of anyone's management of the war but give little evidence for their views. Bradley, Nimitz, Hodges, Fletcher, Wavell, Clark, King, and others are criticized professionally and personally (which may be deserved) but little is said to justify their views."
2,A Book To Be Ignored...,"A book that adds nothing new of importance and merely recaps observations that have been made more convincingly by others. Frankly, it reads like a compilation of the authors' lecture notes for a college survey class in ""World History Of The 20th Century.""Extremely superficial, with lots of personal asides like ""Arnold, a sick, bitter man"" that the authors never expand upon and that seem to have no relevance to the matter at hand. (For example, this reference was stuck in the middle of a very short discussion of Curtis LeMay's appointment as the replacement commanding officer responsible for strategic bombing of Japanese cities.)Similar titles by John Keegan, Max Hastings and/or Richard Overy would all be better choices."
5,"It surprises me to be in agreement with Newt Gingrich, but..","this is a very good book. A nice blend of Grand Strategy & Grand Tactics. Very readable & balanced. The title gives the impression of bias from the Allied perspective, yet this is not the case. If you wanted just one general book of WW2, I would not hesitate to recommend this title. IMHO, a much better book than it's competitors, such as ""A World at Arms"""
4,Talking to the readers...,"The appeal of Stendhal's 'on love' is that it is written in a very fact style than fiction and yet interesting. This is a book in which the writer is busy writing to the reader and not lost in the craft of making characters.His concept of crystallisation is interesting to read on and not very difficult to identify with if you have reached the fifth stage of life successfully.We all run after happiness, but he questions its definition.Love in various countries is so strikingly different. Stendhal has brought out that difference clearly.With such good description on the stages of love, one is left wanting more on 'Remedies Against Love'."
2,Poor performance by Ripper Owens,"Live Meltdown really has the ""cream"" of Judas Priest songs. But the new singer Ripper seems to expend the whole album trying to show how good he is, and he gives us so many highs and lows tones that he sounds like King Diamond, not a singer from Judas Priest !!! For someone who wants to have the best of Judas in only one album, it's much better to buy METALWORKS, of 1993, even if it is not recorded live!!"
1,Save your money....Don't beleive the hype,"I have kept hearing about how great this disc is and how great this ""ripper"" is. Well, I have finally listened to this from beginning to end. I have to say that I am very disappointed. How dare people compare ripper to Rob Halford. It isn't even close. In fact there is nothing special about him at all. It is great to hear the hooks and crunching of the Priests' music again but the vocals just don't do it for me. Granted, Halford may not be able to hit the heights anymore, but at least it would save the embarrassment of hearing poor K.K., Glenn and Ian playing in what is just a shell of its former self, the mighty Judas Priest. JP please know when to say when. Stop the insanity!!!!!"
5,This is Incredible!,"After Unleashed in the East, I thought that no other band would ever release a live record with so much power and intensity. I was wrong. From the opening sounds of the Hellion to the furious Painkiller, this record is just superb. If anyone wants to feel the real thunder of a live metal show, look no more, this is it. Long Live The Priest!!!"
3,It is what it is,I bought this cd because i used to listen to Judas Priest a lot when I was younger.No Rob Halford on this one though.
5,Any doubts of Ripper Owens' ability to lead are cast aside.,"Any doubts of Ripper Owens' ability to replace former front-man Rob Halford are cast aside with the release of this dynamic live CD. With a fresh new face, Judas Priest delivers the same energy and intensity that we have come to love on this new double live CD."
3,"it's not rob...but, it's ok","a little disappointed that cd itself was scratched but i am not docking it for that reason (i rip a lot of reviewers a new one for giving bad reviews based on the actual purchase versus the music itself, so i won't go there) anyway, back to the music on the cd. priest fans seem to be divided on the singer, tim ""ripper"" owens. as a long time judas priest fan from back in the day, i will tell you that he's not rob halford(you realize this as the band has to actually play all the songs in a lower key because ripper really can't hit the notes like rob) either way, instrumentally speaking, the band is on fire. the show is very energetic and ripper is actually a good singer. just made me wanna listen to unleashed in the east."
5,Great Live Album!,"This is a terrific live album with a great set list. However, for all of those who think that Ripper blows Halford out of the water, keep this in mind: all of the songs on this album are transposed to a lower key. For all those guitar players out there, I believe its dropped at least a whole step thus, increasing Ripper's apparent range. Halford sang all of his stuff in standard tuning which just shows you how talented he really was(is). That being said, Ripper's performance is still incredible and Glenn and KK are transposing their music to fit the range of their singer."
1,If you like good games..You'll hate this one!,"Seriously.. Tic Tac Toe is nearly as exciting as this game. If you don't believe me, check a *real* game review site like boardgamegeek dot com! Run away!"
5,Fun Game,Very Fun Game! Even my younger grandchildren could play. Spice it up when playing with adults & play for dollars instead of chips!
5,2nd best vuillard collection,"i've only found one vuillard collection bigger (better) than this one. it's the complete collection: a 3 volume set (same page size as this book). i've only seen it in art libraries in large universities; it must cost hundreds. for us mortals, Cogeval's selection will satisfy 99.99% of the vuillard fans out there. the image quality is quite good -- i've seen them framed. and the text is well written."
1,bad advice???????,another waste of time. dont buy this book unless you are totally new to real estate.I dont return books as a practice but i am returning both books by this authur.I am a professional invester there are good books these are not them.
3,Cheap. Interesting,"Actually the audio quality is excellent. However, the microphones picked up all kinds of action noise. I'm an organbuilder so I know what I'm hearing. There is also wind shake (flexible winding) but the musicianship is very good, nice steady beat, no these guys are not Virgil Fox but who is? If this is your only copy of Bach organ music you could do better. You could do worse too. Lazerlight CDs are really cheap so don't complain. Variety is the spice,.. I would like to know however, what organs are being played. That's a serious omission."
5,The game of the year,"This is one of the best XBOX games of all time. Yeah it has its little problems, like changing the pistol and changing the multiplayer maps. But you have to look on the good side like having 14 levels and being able to double wield most weapons. If you look past the little defaults it is a great game."
3,ITS OKAY BUT TOO HYPED,"Halo II was ok but not as enjoyable as Halo I:Combat Evolved as it is one and the same-thing.Just improvements here and there like graphics,new vehicles, etc. etc.-Typical sequal really,but was still fun-Letsee what XBox 360`s HALO 3 will be like.If you like sci-fi stuff like Star Wars i reccomend HALO 2 or if you want to try HALO at least rent it.I play Far Cry InStincts quite alot now as its a more new game to me and i generally rate FCI over HALO 2 as a better game.END REVIEW.VIDEO GAMES SERIES I AM FANS OF:(there are multi-plat games but i play them on that specific console)i have all 3 mjr consoles.--------------------------------------------------------------ON PS2:Metal Gear Solid,Grand Theft Auto,DRIVER,The Getaway,SOCOM:U.S Navy SEALs,Star Wars:BattleFront,WWE SmackDown!,HITMAN.ON XBOX:sometimes HALO,Far Cry Instincts series,Star Wars:KOTOR,Call Of Duty,Brothars In Arms,Medal Of Honor,007,FABLE,Any ""Tom Clancy"" series with the exceptn of SPLINTER CELL-SC sucks HELL."
4,Good game.... but your all obsessed,"I like Halo but.....there are other games out there, better games. I have seen WAY to many people on xbox live that are halo CRAZY! It's sad and pothetic.Oh and as for that one guy who was talking about Mario coming in and ""beating up the bad guy""...either you where reviewing the wrong game or your on drugs because Mario is not even in this game and any idiot could tell that is is violent just by looking at the cover."
2,Up yours Bungie,"First it took me more time at work to make the money to buy the game than to finish it! Up yours!Second it ends on a cliff-hanger and you jerks say that you are not doing Halo 3! Up yours!Third one of the true gems of the first game, the pistol has been reduced in power and we get a bunch of other crappy stuff to replace it, keep the damn sword and give me halo 1's pistol back. Up Yours three times!!Music? Did you just copy an Enya cd into the game, terrible!!Gameplay? Ten minutes of looking for badguys, six seconds to kill them then ten more minutes of tedium, BOOOOOOORRRRRIIIINNNG!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED! If you have to play it a $6 rental is much better than $50 to buy and you can finish the game in the morning and still have time for a decent game like doom 3 or half-life 2 for the rest of the day.Summation: HALO2 SUCKS AND SO DO YOU BUNGIE!!"
2,What an end to the most hyped huh?,"After playing the game with my cousin and reading the online reviews I would have to say that this game pretty much sucked the big one. OMG, Bungie, what the hell are you thinking putting this game out there after we, the buyers, had to wait 2+ yrs to play. I mean don't get me wrong, the graphics, the voice-over and the weapons were awesome. But, the ending? Come on now, I saved up big time to get this and had pre-ordered months in advance to receive the ""Game of the Year"" please! The original, Halo, beats this one in to. Also, I didn't like playing between the Convenant and as Master Chief. Pick one side and stick with it. They should make it like this: First play as Master Chief then after beating the game as a human give the option to play as the convenant or maybe...The Flood. Oh, Bungie, if you're reading this: Make an ending that the gamer will like and not one the blows."
3,Halo 2,Haven't been able to play it cause my Xbox 360 needs a thumbdive to open and work some of the oder games like this? Did the oder Xboxes have a harddrive included? Why wouldn't they stick a little internal thumbdrive in the new ones's.It ain't like it cost alot or takes u alot of room? So we'll see since I haven't bought my thumbdive for the machine yet...
5,Great multiplayer,"I dont have much to say on the campaine but the multiplayer is great. On the maps u can get over a dozen different kinds of wepons (sadly u can only hold 2 at a time). And also there are like a dozen vehicles like warthogs, ghosts, banshees, scorpion tanks and theres a few more. and theres a lot of maps and if u really want to do a lot of multiplayer (brother sister friends ect.) by the halo map pack, lots of cool maps.In conclusionPros:great storygreat mutiplayerCons:Moms dads girlfriends hate it."
5,the best for new gamers,Me and my brother are both almost done with the game I am 12 and my brother is 10 and we are on level 9 in a week but its the best
3,why did it take so long to come out,"I got all excited and bought this game the moment it was released at wal-mart. This game has been delayed over and over again. It was allot of fun to play, very short though. It seems to me that the designers have been taking all this time ti improve the online play-which is the best on any game yet. But, the offline play is virtually unimproved and shorter than the original. You still have to use a first person shooter, which the option of third person should be made available. If you are an online gaming fanatatic, then this is the game for you. If you like the offline campaign and things like that-then this game is a huge waste of money. Buy the first Halo for $15 instead. Though the levels are different, it is fundamentally the same game, and should of been released two years ago."
3,It's great but wayyyyyyy too short.,I saw the game demo on Halo 1 and I was like duel weapons! Awesome! When I opened it I was estatic and when I was playing it it was cool but after a while I was like duel weapons meh. And when I got to the end I felt this stomach pit feeling and I was like WHAT??!!!!!! IT'S OVER?????!!!!!!! So I would suggest it but don't expect it to be long like Halo combat evolved.
5,great halo game,halo 2 is a great game dont listen to the bad reviews i am a halo fan i own every halo game ever made and halo 2 is one of the best this game should have gotten 5 stars not 4 click the yes button if i helped
5,This game is an instant classic to me,I don't think I have ever played a game that has had such a well thought out and intense campaign. It is substantial compared to all other first person shooters. I recommend this game to anyone. It never gets old and has some clever Easter eggs as well. It's like watching an action packed movie that never ends. Great game. Good job Bungie
3,good but...,"i liked this game don't get me wrong, hours of play time and lots of fun just like any other halo game with multiplayer. the only thing that bothered me was the balancement with the weapons. if you had an energy sword, rocket launcher, or sniper rifle (depending on map)you were unstoppable, other guns just seemed so worthless like entire clips wouldn't kill anything."
3,It sometimes froze,"It sometimes froze and I rage quit because it was annoying and lost audio! But after a few days it worked fine,So thank you my good sir"
3,ZOMBIE NEED MOOOORE!,"ME ZOMBIE GROW TIRED OF SAME GAMEPLAY! ZOMBIE NEED MORE BRAINS! ZOMBIE LIKE ONLINE, BUT ENDING PISS ZOMBIE OFF!!!MOOORE!!!UUHHHHHHHH...UUHHHHHH..."
5,Best Multiplayer Game ever,"Like I said, the best multiplayer game ever. I play it all the time, I work in fire/rescue and when we get down-time at the station, you can probably find us all playing HALO 2, even the Chief"
3,Can you say....overrated,"Dont get me wrong, this is a good game, a really good game, but has problems. The single player gets old fast....and isnt worth it....so if u dont have xbox live dont get this game. Second ,its nothing special. Its a good shooter and nothing more. Nothing spectacular and not worth ending relationships over. People play it because its named halo 2...should it be named something else....people would not play it nearly as much. Good game....and ill admit it does deserve one award....msot overrated game of 2004"
2,"Bungie, MS you should be ashamed","I second all of the previous negative comments about this pitiful excuse for a sequel to HALO. I knew the game would never live up to all of the hype but never in my wildest dreams did I think it would suck this bad. Maybe the multiplayer makes some people happy but I loved the original HALO for the storyline and intense level play in the campaign. All of that is gone in HALO 2. Might as well have thrown $50 out of the window. Run from this game, run very far away..."
4,Halo 2...a gaming benchmark,"Halo 2 is the sequel to the blockbuster Xbox game, Halo: Combat Evolved. Halo 2 is the much anticipated sequel, and is arguably one of the best ever First-Person Shooters. Firstly, the graphics are much improved over the original game. There's also a great deal of realism added, such as lighting effects and even the sound becomes muffled when you're in a vacuum (space). The game's music is very good, suits the situations and the theme song is back. The gameplay is more than your average FPS. Compared to Halo:CE, Halo 2 is much faster. New vehicles,weapons and characters make an appearance, and one of Halo 2's strongest features is its superb storyline. Overall, this game has a great package, including fantastic, virtually never-ending multiplayer, and will leave you drooling, wanting for more."
5,Great Game but I never realized it was short,Well ever since Halo 2 came out for the X-Box Last week It really improved Halo fans nationwide. However since I foundout that Halo 2 was a little bit short I still think it's oneof the Best Games ever. But right before Halo 2 came out The Original was Rereleased for the PC. But Hey Halo 2 is a pretty good game to me.
4,good game - but not as good as the first,"This is a good game but not as good as the first. The one thing that I really do not like about this game is that when you beat a level on normal,heroic,or legendary it does not mark the symbol next to the level that shows you beat it. That really disappointed me. In the first one i beat the game on easy then it was fun to beat levels on normal, herioc, then legendary so that the levels can have all the sybols on them. On this game, when i beat a level on normal or herioc, it does not do anything at all to show that i did it. Overall this is a fun game to play,especially on multiplayer."
4,"Fun, Fun, Fun!!!","There is enough in print about the wonderful attributes of Halo2-This is to inform you of one shortcoming. If you want to play solo-you can only complete the campaign. It would have been nice to offer an option of competing against some of the covenant in the games like Slayer, King of the Hill, etc. I suppose this was done on purpose to get single players to subscribe to Live!. Other than that one issue, it is a really fun game and well put together. I'd buy it again!"
4,Best FPS ever but way too short,"Halo & Half Life are the 2 best FPS's period. The Original Halo set all new standards. This one is even better with greatly improved graphics, excellent sound, perfect controls and it is very well polished.The plot is great except for the ending which pretty much leaves everything hanging, like they ran out of space before they finished the story.Also in standard mode I completed it in under 12 hours. I'm 59 years old, I'm not that fast. You younger players are really going to be dissappointed with the length of single play campaign.The original Halo in standard mode took me a lot longer the first time and Hero mode on 2nd play through still took over 20 hours. It would easily have gotten 5 stars and best ever rating if it was about twice as long and had a little better sense of completion at the ending.I Havent done multiplayer yet, but have heard its great and still wouldnt upgrade 4 star rating due to pitiful shortness of single player."
3,Good for an old-school shooter,"Not as good as Call of Duty in my opinion, but a fun shooter. I picked up an old X-Box at a yard sale and this fits the bill for stocking up on some classics."
4,GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD :D,"This game is a good game although, some weapons dropped cannot be used, which means you have to buy the third game...."
4,Very happy with purchase!,Couln't find game new anywhere else for price. Was shipped and arrived on time :)
5,"Speechless Of Fun, 1 Of The Best",I Got it 2nd day my eyes were staring at the T.V. for 3 hours. If you have Halo but don't have Halo 2 get it-The Graphics are better than doom 3-The game is stay home fun-it's only 49.99 (cheap for this game)-It makes U Speechless my rating is over infianate starsYa Heard Me-$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
2,Don't You Dare Believe It.,"Next to ""Fable"", this game was THE DISAPPOINTMENT of last year. Go back into a few video game magazine archives and look at what these guys promised us, but didn't even come close to delivering on.The game is so terribly flawed and mundane, that it makes the first one look even better than ever.And to make matters worse, they went all Hideo Kojima (Metal Gear) on us, and made us play as one of the Covenant. This is the second dumbest idea in video game history---next to of course, Kojima making us play as ""Not Solid Snake"".The multiplayer is cool for about ten hours, but after awhile you'll be longing for the comfort-zone provided by the original ""Halo"", and if you're like me, you may weep at the thought of what this game could and should have been.A painfully average game at-best...but definately not ""Halo"".2.5 Overall. 3 for fun ONLY because of the multiplayer modes."
1,"Not what it could have been, or should have been","All we needed was Halo 1.5(like the reviewer below said) and we would have been fine. The game is mediocre at best, and the Xbox Live sucks. You can't even pick the game type, or map that you want to play on. I didn't pay $50 for some nerds that made the game to tell me what level I(the paying customer) get to play.Now, even with a million signatures, it will never work, but just check out the link. It's actually a petition for Halo 1.5[...]As I said, it wont work. But, if you sign, it could force Bungie to make Halo 3 the way it SHOULD be made, not like every other game on the market, but a unique game, like Halo was."
1,Halo 2 was a big let down... I hated it.,"Halo 2 is the most overrated game of all time. Ghost Recon 2 blows it out of the water. I returned Halo 2 after a couple of nights. It offers NOTHING new for a 1st person shooter.I have no clue why so many people like it so much. The online play was weak as well.Get Ghost Recon 2, much better game, with alot less hype."
2,When did Doom get these good graphics?,"Halo:MasterChief...what an incredibly DORKY name! ...Master...Chief..Where the HELL did they come up with the name...MasterChief...Space Marines. Alright guys, Doom was a fun game, but It got old a FEW years ago.So, MasterChief, did Samus sell you her suit design, or did you just copy it? By the way, did you know that Gamecube is cheaper than Xbox, and Metroid Prime costs about $20 less than Halo 2?I guess I'll give Halo 2 stars [...]Shoot! Kill! Shoot! Kill! Doesn't that happen enough these days?"
2,KILLZONE is better halo bites!!,"when i play halo online here is what happenswithin the first 5 seconds a rpg round hits they fly around like machine gun rounds and if u do get a shot threw at somone all of the ""halo elite"" will use there number one tactic JUMPING and u can jump to high. u sneek up on them they get hit with a non rpg round turn around and start jumping back they think there good they suck!! when i play kz online its awesome when a round hits close to u you hear it ricochet u can get 2 clips off with a standard rifle without being hit by an rpg round and a sniper can play well u actaully have to draw fire from a sniper then flood there position with mg rounds or morters (but they arent all over the map) so any halo fan that has somthing to say about this reaveiw say it cause halo sucks!!"
5,"TRULY.., AWESOME IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD!","THIS GAME IS TRULY AMAZING. THE STORY, GRAPHICS, AI ARE TRULY AMAZING.HANDS DOWN THE BEST GAME I HAVE PLAYED EVER.THE AI IS SO CLEVER, IT MAKES YOU THINK YOU ARE PLAYING ANOTHER PERONS.I WOULD RATE THIS 6 STARS, BUT I CANT A TRUE BUY IN EVERY SENSE.GO HIT THE BUY BUTTON."
1,Halo 2,I'm not happy because it didn't work I was supposed to get another one but they never sent it out. Still waiting for it to come.
3,"ANOTHER ""MATRIX"" DISASTER","Remember waiting for the sequel to the Matrix? When it came out, you thought, well that wasn't bad, but I can hardly wait for the next one. This is what Halo 2 is, an over hyped piece of a scatter brained material, that doesn't know where to go, or what to do. Except wait for the next installment...in another three years!"
3,Major disappointment,"Side by side screen co-op, stupidIndoor setting stupidStory stupidNot including Bots, ????? Live????I am a 36 year old gamer and I bought 3 x-box systems just because of Halo. I dont know what bungie was thinking but this game is nothing compared to the original. I do not see the need to change a perfect recipe for for a watered down soup version of the original. Bungie must have have either replaced the original team or hired too many cooks. All the hype was for nothing, the bad thing about it is that I bought 2 for system link."
4,Real cool Game,I think the game is totaly awesome.You have cool new abilities like dual wielding some guns and bording enemy ships.Also that in Halo 1 your allies where weak and in the new version they can do something else than just shooting.The only thing I dislike about the game is that in cooperative mode the game dosn't save the process.But in general I think it is much better than Halo 1.
3,Better than Halo,"Halo 2 improved over Halo with better controls, dual wielding, and a few new weapons and enemies. One should be prepared for a little confusion, you not only fight as the master chief, in some chapters you fight as an enemy called the arbiter. I found this somewhat confusing and did not really care for playing the arbiter, it seemed like I was betraying my side. While it is a fun game, there are others I like much better."
5,Halo 2,"Greatest multiplayer ever, single player is several steps down from the original halo but the multi player is several steps up"
3,"OK, but not as good as the 1st","this game is incredibly good, but it smply lacks the brilliance of the 1st game. especially the levels where u r a covenant arbitor, are very annoying. the last level in the game u do as the arbitor which doesnt work for me"
2,"So, where's Halo 2?",It was an unfinished and incomplete product. Extremely repetetive and uninspired.Who likes to play a game that ends half way through the story and in midst of battle?!Professional game mags should be ashamed of their bogus hype.
3,What happened?,"They advertised:>>Better control: sprint at twice normal speed, peek around corners, chain melee attacks into devastating combos<<What happened? Also, what happened to the scenes that were in the E3 preview that weren't in the game? Did they decide to chop it in half so we would not have to wait as long for a sequel?Good, but not great. I enjoy Halo much more."
3,EHHHHHH---its ok,Its just not THAT good. its good---but not the best. AFter all the hype and delays---its good. NOT great like everyone stated. For all the hard core dorks out there that like story lines your going to be dissapointed. Intro to HALO 3 so they can all rape you of your money again
4,Awesome Game,This is a great game overall. The campaign is WAY better in halo 1 but it is still fun when you have it on a higher difficulty. The only problem with Xbox live is the moddders and Standbyers that play. It's like when you get to a lvl 31+ you will get cheated and sometimes before that. I really don't get why people have to cheat to see a number go up.
3,Lacking consistency with the original Halo powerhouse,"A few things, there should be a health bar, grenades should be thrown better and actually work like they used to, the radar should actually work instead of misleading you to think there is no one around, and finally you should not die after just a few shots from a double gun combination. To add to my dismay is the setup of Xbox Live and the way you join games, you must practically know everyone you play unless you want to wait to get set up in a game that you didn't even get to choose.For all the time it took, considering all the good and the bad about this game, it is more or less a worse game than the first."
1,what a waste of money,"I guess if you like bad scifi and don't mind mindnumbing stupidity this game is for you. I was told that this was great game. What a disappointment. The scenes are so chaotic that you can not follow along as to who you are supposed to be fighting, obviously the idiotic little aliens, or where you are supposed to be headed in this game.I have no problem with having to reload a weapon, but please give me a realistic amount of ammo to fight with. I also realize that you can be killed, but give me a fighting chance.I have told the person who recommended it to me to reimburse me, because this one is a waste of the money."
1,BAD GAME; RENT IT DON'T BUY IT,"This is a horrible sequel to the first Halo game. The screen is pitch black 99% of the time and doesn't offer any real challenges.Don't buy it, you've been warned."
5,"EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT,EXCELLENT, (ETC)","EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT,EXCELLENT, (ETC). THIS IS TRUELY AN AMAZING GAME. WITH OVER 30 WEAPONS, 10 VEHICLES, AND 15 MISSIONS, PLUS ONLINE SUPPORT, THIS IS AN AWESOME GAME, MIGHT BE RECORDED IN HISTORY AS ONE OF THE BEST EVER.PROS:EVERYTHINGCONS:NOTHING"
1,Gave me a rip off!!!,I was shocked badly after I played this game.I got ripped off badly.I wanted my $80.00 back.This is my warning don't buy this game.I warn you.
1,Boring After One Week,"Unless you want some fun for only a week, avoid this disappointing sequel to the truly great game: Halo.Microsoft has done it again: create a great product and follow it up with no substance. There are 1,000 reasons that this game now stinks and you can find them all over the Internet.If you are good with Halo, Halo 2 will be sure to disappoint you. If you have never played before, either one will do, but better players are migrating back to the original."
1,HALO 2: I told you ALL so....,"HALO 2. Yep. The game EVERYONE said would be the best. The game EVERYONE said would revolutionize gaming. It revolutionized it all right. It made FPS's everywhere feel ashamed that ONE game could be so dull. It is NO, and I mean NO different from the first HALO (which also sucked). It has no point WHAT-SO-EVER. Point A to B (like someone on here had said). Oh yeah, FPS's are supposed to be shooting fun, i know, but they need a point to them, BUT NOT THIS GAME!!!! Shoot, reload, shoot some more. Vehicles give it no touch at all. You want a first person shooter, get STARSIEGE TRIBES for PC. If your PC was mad in 1999 or later, your PC can take a game 10 times better the HALO."
3,For Xbox only!,"I got Halo 2 in the condition it was descirbed as, which was brand new and still sealed, but the game won't work right on an xbox 360. I have the new 250GB model and I can't even get to the first mission. It takes about 10 minutes to load to the first cutscene, which is laggy and choppy, and then get another loading screen which never moves from 0%. Only buy this game if you have an original xbox. Any suggestions I welcome."
5,Excellent,"OMG Halo2 is second only to SSCT. This game is genious while I love the single player mode is great multiplayer is where its at. I myself have logged in almost 1,000 matches on Xbox Live this game is great and I strongly recommend this game to everybody."
5,"An Incredible Game, Possibly the best game ever!","After playing this game for over 17hrs.My conclusion is this game is UNBELIEVABLE SUPERB.The whole package is tremendous.I was glued to the TV, like fly to dung.I would rate this a 6 star if I could."
5,Halo 2 review in one sentence,"The best game you could ever buy, awesome gameply, superior co-op, you can play as !!!THE COVENANT!!!, perfect graphics, dual wield, best story line ever concocted, and flat out fun to play.P.S. Get off your computer and go by this game!P.S.S Go now!! What are you waiting for!! GO!!!"
2,a repeat of the last,Halo 2 isn't bad if you haven't already beaten Halo 1. It has the exact same story line and you are still dealing with the flood. Halo 2 is just an enhanced version of Halo 1 in a different environment. It gets very boring if you've already beaten Halo 1.
4,sniping,there's enough reviews for this game already so i will make it short and sweet. all in all this has got to be one of the most entertaining games i have played. 1 star is taken off overall not because of the game itself but because of the unreal amount of snipers you are bound to run into while playing online which could in turn... ruin your entire day. also the story line takes a step backwards from the original. but overall still a very fun game
3,Way to short for the price,"Not as good as the first Halo, but a very good game, without a doubt beautiful, fun, and great A.I....but for fifty bucks I was left feeling cheated. Had I known it would only last 8/9 hours, I would've rented it."
5,No more Multiplayer,"Yes, Halo is great. I love all the Halo games and I loved and still love this one. Tons of great reviews and everything for this game. Only problem is. You cannot play multiplayer on Halo 2 anymore. I don't know why anyone might even want to still try with Halo Reach and Halo 4 already out there. But just figured it should be said. Halo 2 Anniversary would be awesome!"
4,HALO 2,"It was a good game it had good graphics and a good story. The only thing I didn't like about it was the ending to the campaign and that you can't change the shields, the only thing you could do to the shields was put on an oversheild which was too much. Also the swords are hard to learn how to use but other than that i would reccomend this game to anyone who wants a good shooter game and doesn't have a 360."
3,"UMMMM, YEAH?","WHAT THE HELL HAS BUNGIE BEEN DOING FOR THE PAST THREE FREAKIN' YEARS!!!! There are so many problems I wouldn't know where to begin. At first I thought that the multiplayer online play was the only thing that saved this game, until i had played it for awhile. It gets boring quick, because it is so repetive. Those damn bungie commies choose what you're gonna play everytime. Sure its cool for a little while because the games start up so fast, but come on. Overall, the game is kinda fun, for about a week."
4,"Good game, as expected. Difficult to find in stores.","The game arrived quickly and as expected. I had tried to find this in the game stores for a while, but this was difficult to find. I was happy to find it online."
5,This game was better than the first one!,"""Halo Combat Evolved"" had a better story mode than ""Halo 2"". But ""Halo 2"" had a way better multyplayer."
4,cool,ok basicly the best game ever.... I like duel weilding.... multiplayer is good but the maps arent as good as on the first one.... kinda dissapointing story line and a horrible ending but ya know its still the best game ever so far.p.s. that last reveiw was retarded and was random
5,One of the best shooters,"Halo 2 is by far one of the best shooters of all time. It is worth alone to buy an xbox. It has all the good things great mutiplayer levels, great campanine levels. One thing I like about the multiplayer is some of the levels are really big and some of the levels are really small.I don't get why people say dule welding ruins the game becasue it does not. The only thing bad about it is that you can not throw gernades. I recommened this game to anyone who likes good shooters."
4,Halo 2 is solid,"I can't remember the last time a played Halo, oh yeah, because Halo2 was in the makin for 3 years! Ok, hijacking vehicles is just something to get the GTA fans to buy it. However, it does make the make the game a little easier. (damn banshee! slow down so i can shoot your pilot!) The story is sub-par, which is a letdown because halo 1's story was brilliant. THe graphics? Gorgeous. The sound? Stunning. The gamplay. Eh... the dual wielding is kinda' confusing and hard. I liked the new weapons, but dual wielding stinks. But this game WHEN THE PRICE GOES DOWN."
5,Greatest first person shooter..heck greatest game ever,"This game has everything a shooter must have great battles,tough enemies,good AI,and lots of different guns.The story is probobly the best story ever told in a videogame(it even beats final fantasy in my opinion),and delivers big after a long wait.But of course there are a few small flaws ike in every game.One of the flaws is the sheild dosent last as long as the first game but it recharges 10x faster.The marines AI seemed to have downgraded a tiny bit making them not quite as good but heck youre the master cheif what do you need marines for...but overall i think this game is a better game than the original these small little flaws are microscopic and really dont matter.Plus the music is great i even picked up the soundtrack.This game is a must buy for any X-box owner."
3,Probebly the Most overrated Game Ever,"I will never understand why many people call Halo one of the best games of all time. It's a good game no doubt, but calling it classic or the best shooter of all time is silly. I've played many shooter games on X-box (Splinter cell, timeSplitter) and all of those games are better and more fun than this game. It's a good game but critics be always overrating it."
4,Halo 2 is ausome!!! But Halo is still to be surpassed,1.0-1.9 abysmal2.0-2.9 terrible3.0-3.9 bad4.0-4.9 poor5.0-5.9 medicor6.0-6.9 fair7.0-7.9 good8.0-8.9 great9.0-9.9 superb10 perfectHalo 2 is ausome!!!!! one of the best games all year!!! I was one of the first people to resurve it and it was worth it!!!! But Halo 2 has its downsides Like the levels they are really fun and have wepons everywere but sometimes I had no clue of were I was going.second of all the bad storyline.But halo is the most fun game of the year.I liked how when ghosts or tanks were coming at you you could jack them. Overall Halo 2 is ausome!!!! I give it a 9.4-10 supurb game. by it as soon as possible!!!
1,I liked it better,"the first time I played it when it was called Turok. I will never understand the obsession with First Person shooters. They are all the same and Halo is no different. Ohhh, you get to drive in a vehicle, been there done that in the 80's and 90's. Just like Eminem, it's tired folks, move on."
1,trash,"This game is absolute trash. In fact the whole Halo series is trash. The whole idea of an inter-galactic warrior batteling space creatures is a dumb idea. I played all of the games in the series and after 10 minutes with each of them I wanted to gauge my eyes out. Wht don't you go out and buy a real game like Saints Row, Call of Duty, Rainbow Six, or any other game that isn't this.If you even think about buying this you might as well throw your money into a fire and watch it as it slowly burns."
3,"ehh, not bad, but...","This game gets repetitive...seriously... I vividly remember beating the first 7 or 8 missions, than taking it home,and forgetting about it!this game took me 3 months to beat! You know why? Because i dreaded playing it sometimes! It is so repetitive and boring! I forgot that i had it! On average, a game will take me a few days to a week to complete, but since i got a bunch of 2005's games, ive been overwhelmed! Repetitive games such as Halo 2 and Prince of Persia have made me think twice about games...Oh well, thank God for Brothers in Arms and the Warriors.PS: Enter the Matrix took me 6 months to beat, only because i never played it: I was stuck on this one damned level that i couldnt beat!So i gave up for the first time on a game. Just saying...Jughead out"
3,"shoutout to anchorman ""ron""!","...........you're a bully! yeah, that's right! you're obviously over 13 since you have a username. look at the author of the review you called wimp. a kid! someone under 13! what else do you do, slap a pregnant woman's stomach?p.s. a b-day is a BIRTHday, seems like you never celebrated yours. o_0?"
3,"Halo2 is good , but not as much fun as original Halo","For those who have played the original game its obvious that Halo2 isn't what we all expected.Apart from throwing in few more weapons and enemies (brutes et al) the game is pretty much the same.I wouldn't consider the graphics to be awesome , but its good.There aren't any levels which you want to play again and again like ""truth and recon.."".Overall a good game ,but a let down though."
1,WORST GAME EVER,"This is the worst game I have ever, EVER, played in 15 years. This is just the biggest pile of steaming crape that i have ever seen. I would rathe rip my tounge out and eat it then play this mind numbing trash."
3,Not as big of an improvement as Grand Theft Auto San Andreas,Wasn't a big fan of the first title for a number or reasons. One being the story mode being repetative and two for making everyone a master cheif on multiplayer. It seemed rush. The sequel stills has a dull story mode but the multiplayer is a lot better but I normally don't have 16 buddies to play with so I normally worry about single player and this one fails. Thats why San Andreas rules in my book. You can not beat San Andreas before Halo 2 guarenteed.
1,Halo Sucks,Halo 2 is even worse than Halo 1. Halo 2 is more unrealistic than the first. The vehicles are mainly the same and the guns are a little different. If you didnt like the firt Halo dont buy this because it is even stupider. They should have changed the name because it sounds like a game for girls. The grafics havent gotten better. If you like realistic shooting games get Conflict Veitnam. It is very realistic and theres 14 missions and over 40 weapons.
4,Hey Bungie..you call that an ending??,"If you liked Halo, you'll like this one. The developers took a different approach in the presentation. In the first Halo going from level to level seemed more seemless..the story line unfolded in front of you instead of having cut scenes..which is what the new Halo does. Not a bad thing..just different. I do think the game was short..it wouldn't have bothered me so badly if it had a more proper ending. I won't give anything away, but I think I vocally said ""That's It?"" after the last level...which in no way felt like a final level. But it was fun while it lasted."
4,"Good, but could be better","Halo 2 has good gaphics, good game play, and a good story. This game is a great sequel to the first. It has great multiplayer split screen game play.You get to be spartan and the Elite alien, you get to play both sides of the Halo 2 story! The thing that I don't like about Halo 2 is that the Flood returns. I hated fighting the flood in the first Halo, and wasn't expecting to fight them again in Halo 2. The main theme of Halo 2 was that you were going to have to protect earth from the aliens, you did do that, but I was expecting to fight them on earth the intire game, but you don't, you fight on earth for 2 levels and then you don't come back untill the end of the game.This game still is a great game despite the few flaws. When you beat the game, split screen is still a very fun part of the game if you have a friend to play with (its acually my favorite part of the game).This is a great game so go play it!"
4,A continuing classic,"Halo 2 is probably the best in the series. Many may argue that Halo 3's many new maps, high definition graphics, and new vehicles weapons and modes make it the best, I rest with Halo 2.First of all, the campaign is much better than Halo and slightly better than that of Halo 3. The game also is at a perfect sci-fi state without being too ridiculous. Halo 3 gets a little out of hand and ends up being just too ambiguous.Once past the Halo 2 ending (which leaves you really curious and a great hook for Halo 3) you would naturally move on to Multiplayer.The multiplayer of Halo 2 is, to say the least, fantastic. There are always people online looking for games to play and you can customize the games in so many different ways to your liking.It gets a little hectic at times but is built so that skill is really all that matters, perfect for a great FPS"
3,just average,"played the first halo. it had some great moments. mind you, it wasn't perfect. game was too dark, some maps were reused, & too much backtracking. i dont understand why bungie couldn't have included a map so i'd know where i was going. also, the library chapter was plain repetitive tedium. halo 2 was basically the same, probably even worse. i mean, playing as the arbiter sucked. basically too much hype. but the multiplayer is where halo shines. solo campaigns are just ok."
2,"Decent, at best","This game is a matter of comparison. It's SP, compared with its predecessor, is complete garbage. You get about two levels in, and you start to wonder why you are still holding the controller. If you want to keep up with the story, then play the SP game, and pay close attention, as it is rather complex. If you don't plan to get H3 and finish out the story line, then you probably won't have the patience to finish the game.As for the MP, it is better than the first one. Which is not to say it is good, as the balance factor is terrible (battle rifle, plasma pistol, rocket launcher, and sniper rifle - thats it, the only worthwhile guns in the game, roughly in order of importance). The only more unbalanced online shooter I have played in recent memory was . . . well . . . Halo 1.Overall, it is only valuable as a segue between Halos 1&3. Otherwise, avoid it, its not worth the time."
3,Great graphics & storytelling,"The graphics and story are top-notch, but I beat the game on Normal mode within a day at a lax pace. The fun value also goes away at the more extreme difficulty levels as the programmers make it almost satirical in toughness. Fortunately, it's engaging enough for one or two repeat plays.My biggest problem is some of the controls, whereas you want to use two weapons sometimes the computer feels it best to throw one of them across the room at random. Overall, I guess it's a great game if you are a multiplayer freak, but add an NPC option next time!"
5,"The Best Game Ever, and will be for decades","Only One word for this game. AWESOME, BRILLIANT, REMARKABLE, MASTERPIECE.Okay that was more than one word.I've been playing this game online, and this game puts PC multiplayer to shame.It is the best multiplayer experience, since I went online 7 yrs ago.The single player campaign can be seen as a bonus, as the multiplayer is the king of the hill."
5,The Best FPS ever!,this is the best fps i have ever played the beam sword is wicked the guns are awesome id rate this game 15/10 i recomennd u buy this now!!!
3,The Item i bought,The game had scratches and weird almost oily marks on the disk cleaned it up abit and it works fine...i recommend getting this game.
4,Astounding,"This game is truly amazing. It takes all of the original's ""cool factor"" and adds a second gun to it. The only problem I had was that it was very limited in music."
5,this was a gift,"this was a gift for my brother, he loves it, but it still did shadowing which he found out is because he is playing it on xbox 360. so he saves, reloads and then he can see fine."
5,Completed the collection,"I was happy to have the game in the original package, and the price was very reasonable! I know my husband was very happy to get this for Christmas as he has ALL the other games in the Halo series."
3,Good game but there are others,"Dont get me wrong I do like this game but, PEOPLE PLAY THIS TO MUCH. My friend has Xbox live and whenever we play on his xbox's ALL ANYONE PLAYS IS HALO,HALO,HALO!!! Its annoying I try to play other games and no one is on them there are a few games people play and thats IT. Come on guys there are other games. Anyway this game is good even in campaign but multiplayer is whats really fun. The first one is better though."
4,Worth the wait...,"Alright, after repeatedly pushing back the release date, Halo2 is everything I had hoped. Now, however, it's been four months and I would have expected some (additional purchase required) online add-ons. How difficult would it have been to release new boards for multiplayer matches? I am still waiting for sidewinder!"
2,abortusWare&#65533;want some?,"Shame on you Jason Jones, shame on you Bill Gates. If any one ever wondered what would happen if the ""first to market at any cost"" approach of M$ would interfere with the creativity and commitment to great gaming that Bungie has shown over the last 15 years, then look no further; this is abortusWareYou get to play alternatively as Master Chief and an Elite. Wage battle after battle (yawn) for .....uh the fun of it. What is fun again? Slaughter creatures for a couple of hours and then watch the game end in mid sentence. Why would anybody want to play a half game? You will stand up and say ""I think I'll empty the cat litter box"".I have followed Bungie since 1990; I have played through the Marathon series, ONI, and the original Halo. Each of these games was fantastic. They kept you thinking between waves of frags. Each was a breath of fresh air.I sold my copy of HALO 2 right after I played it. Get the message?"
4,"Great game, all-nighter maker!! But poor ending","This game is unbelievable. Its defintely worth the time and money for it. Especially watching the moives on 60 inches HDTV, it's life. But the ending sucked, it just faded. I thought it's gonna be a lot more exciting than that. Maybe bungie just got lazy in th e end."
2,One big commercial,"This game sucked! I am probably the only one who feels this way. If you like playing the original Halo, then just keep playing it. The differences in the two games are minimal. And Halo 2 has what is possibly the worst story EVER! The whole game was just an advertisement for Halo 3. Which will probably only be available on the next generation of consoles. 10 out of 10 my eye! Just because it is a sequal to a great game, does not mean it's a great game. So if you like a big let down of a story with hardly any changes between games then get this game. Or you could play the original, and avoid the suck."
5,halo 2 rocks,halo 2 is a great game. my neighbour has it and i love it. i only played it once but it was awesome. the best way to get a jackal quickly is to put a plasma pistol in one hand and an automatic gun in the other hand. charge and shoot the plasma pistol then shoot with the other gun. definetly reccomended for any xbox owner(even though i dont have one). if you only have a ps2 get killzone. if you only have a gamecube get metroid prime 2
5,Awsome,This game is amazing and i just love the halo series it's amazing i got all of the halos and i love them.
2,Halo 2,I would write a proper review about this game but i have not been able to play it. the reason why is because if yo have an xbox 360 slim like me you need a hard drive to play original xbox games.
2,Halo 2,The screen would sometimes freeze the background so it would have that faint image wherever you look. It was annoying.
1,Didnt get the game!,All I got was the collecters edition disc not the game itself and the metal collecters case wich was scratched to hell
5,Halo 2 is amazing,"Halo 2 is the best game ever made for the X-box, far better than Halo 1. Xbox live makes multiplayer games fun again, instead of playing against the same people over and over again. I recommend to everyone even remotely interested in FPS, Action games, any other genres."
3,Its Okay,Thats pretty much all that I can say. The game for the most part is no different than the first halo other than better graphics. Duel weapons is cool but it does take up a lot of the screen. And its annoying to lose one of your weapons when doing a melee attack. Other than that there was nothing really new and innovative. The level design is really crappy. Especially later on with the in dark levels where you have no flash light and can't tell where you are getting attacked from. And the levels just get really repetetive. I just wanted to beat the levels just to get past them instead of to see what is going to happen later. Don't know why it took them so long to get this game out. It was a bit dissapointing.
5,IN REGARDS TO THE GRAPHICS,"I see listings on here time and time again regarding the graphical errors that are apparent in Halo 2. However the reason for this is as such. Do you notice any load times throughout the game? Except for when you first start the game up there are no load times at all, that is due to the fact that the next sage of the game loads during the cut scenes, therefore there are going to be problems with the Xbox hardware playing the cut scenes in real time, while at the same time loading the next level. Also if they used CGI for the cut scenes it would definitely take away from the feel of the game, having what you see in the cut scenes be the same as in the game you play is a huge plus in making the game more absorbing."
4,The second in along line of great fps',"Halo 2 is a great game but there are a few flaws.The graphics are pretty good but the facial animations suck. People are going to hate me for dissing this game but it IS THE most overated Xbox game of all time.Xbox Live is definately where this game shines brightest. Granted there are a few modders but I happen to be a professional glitcher. If you want to play to win, you play a normal game. If you want to glitch, play a game with a few likeminded friends or custom game.The story is almost identical to the first one except you get to play as the Covanant, and no matter how many times you play it the ending will still SUCK.RatingsGraphics:9Sound:10Replayability:5Controls:10Drawn In Atmosphere:8Fun:8Multiplayer, Co-Op:8, Multiplay:10"
5,Halo 2- Is it really that cool?,"Well, people say that Halo 2 is the coolest game on the Earth and are totally indinial about the bad stuff. Sure it's pretty cool but after you beat the game the first couple of times it get pretty old, I mean all you could really play it for, is for Xbox live and you've got to pay for it. I'm just letting you know that when you own Halo 2 make sure that your ready to pay for live and you've got a little brother thats good at video games."
2,A very Hyped Game. Not that much fun to me,I like the ocasinal shooter game. Halo 2 is one shooter game for me is not fun. I didn't enjoy this game as much as I would of. The graphics are amazing but the controls were too hard. If you like the first halo get this game. But I'll get Day of Reckoning.
2,what the heck?,"The story line sucks, the graphics suck, and I could go on and on about the bad things about this game. It took this long to make a terrible game? Wow. The only good thing about this game is a facial expressions. Overall, this game is very upsetting."
2,"Same as the first, but what was MS and Bungie thinking??????","You got to be kidding me. It took 2 years to develop this game when it carries the same basic principles as the first Halo. Atleast GTA series is different in many aspects as apposed to this boring title. First off, the game is way to easy. Hardly any changes in overall game play. This game is 99% hype and .5% joke and .5% fun. Second, I've run into graphic and image overlays and significant stutering during game play. Graphics are improved but still very much similar to Halo 1. I was able to find this game for 39.99 at a local computer store. Its not worth it. Maybe 29.99 or possibly a rental, but certain not for a purchase. If you look passed the hype, the game is nothing more than Halo 1 packaged as Halo 2. With this joke, maybe the rumors are true that MS may back out of the gaming environment......."
1,Halo 2 sucks,Halo 2 has no realistic wepons and come on fighting creatures that dont exist. this is complete rubbish and is easy to get board of and the makers sell it for 50 bucks. It is not even worth 50 cents. it is worthles and is a comlete waist of money.
2,too overhyped,"I was extremely dissapointed in this game. I loved the first on, but in Halo 2 the creators made the game too complicated which ended up making the game not nearly as fun as the first. The first Halo was revolutionary but the 2nd Halo is boring to me. My friends after all of us bought Halo 2 we got together and played Halo 1 over Halo 2 because all of us didn't like the game. The guns suck in this game too. The pistol and machine gun suck. I own both a ps2 and an xbox and i have to say that killzone is way better than this game. So get killzone."
5,response to wow,"You indeed can play the campaign mode with a buddy over x-box live.When the title screen first comes up you must enter the following code.up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, a, b, a, b, start.Then you can play multiplayer and you get 30 lives!!"
1,Halo 2 does not compare,"1st person shooters are great great games, however Halo 2 does not deliver in comparison. Games like Kill Zone, Red faction, and even the James Bond videogames are more fun than Halo. In games like 007 Nightfire, people could do crazy things like drive mini helicopters in multiplayer mode and shoot bazooka's and control where the missile ends up. Halo 2 doesn't have anything extroadinary. For real good 1st person shooters, buy a PS2, a multitap, and some extra controllers. Then go to your local Target and purchase either Medal of Honor, SWAT, Red Faction 1 or 2, any Bond game, or Killzone. Then enjoy real fun 1st person shooter action in split screen mode with your friends because playing all these game like Halo online will ruin your social life and thats no good. Playing games all the time instead of goin out over peoples houses is bad enough so at least have some people over to play with you."
1,Has got to be the most overrated game of all time,"Halo 2 has got to be the most overrated game of all time. People say that they love it and it's the best game ever, but what's fun about running around and shooting people? Just a few good things about the game take the world by storm, and it's annoying.The multiplayer component, the graphics, the vehicles, and that's all. The game requires barely any skill either, you can beat Legendary mode real easy, unless you're that bad at the game. No challenge, no reason to be the best game of all time, the storyline is really unoriginal (wow, an alien invasion, how many times has that been implemented into a storyline...)"
3,Review,"I received the product in a timely manner, but it was not in the good condition as indicated before I purchased the product. It was scratched and had to get a friend come over with a CD fixer kit to take the scratch out so the game would work correctly."
3,Needs official Microsoft HD on xbox 360.,"As a preparation for playing Halo 4 I bought earlier Halo which I used to play on Xbox. Halo Anniversary edition has no problems since its a reissue, Halo 2 however wont play without HD. The description on Amazon said Xbox 360 compatible without any disclaimer. Im just an occasional gamer so I'm not going to spend more for HD just to play this game. Just a heads up for other players who might want to buy this game and have an xbox 360 without an official Microsoft HD."
5,A nostalgic stroll,"With the release of Halo 4, I played through every HALO in order. It is a great way to relive the series. I couldn't find HALO 2 at any retail or used video game store and Amazon was the easiest solution."
5,Halo 2,It is nice because it allows multiple players. It has different levels. It allows the players to interact with each other.
5,Hard to add much more,"Halo 2 is a great game. It just did not wuite reach what everyone expected. That does not mean that what is there is bad. The Live portion of the game is genius, this is what propels this game to 5 stars. The graphics, improved. The Sound and music, amazing. The story, well, lets not go there. No game is perfect but by pure fun and addictiveness Halo 2 is the drug of choice."
5,If You Could See What I Hear,"Saw this movie many years ago, now I can read about his life again. Tom Sullivan is a blind author, actor and his story is an inspiration for others who have a handicap."
5,uplifting,"I'm stationed overseas in bosnia, and it can be very boring. this book gave me hope that my life will be better when i get back to the world. we'll see."
5,"If you like country/cottage style, you'll like this book.","I like Gloria Nicol a lot. Her taste is cottage/country/vintage style, similar to Lucinda Ganderton or Christina Strutt. Her choice of colors is pretty, simple, and cute (not gaudy). I find her ideas refreshing and inspiring. I love the calico, ticking and floral prints she uses for her pillows, seat cusions, etc. The instructions are easy enough to follow for a beginner sewer like myself. I highly recommend this book."
1,"The pictures are quite ""freaky""","I got this book because the reviews were so good.I should have known by the cover that the artwork would be more artistic than child-oriented. I never read it to my child because he scares very easily and I feared the pictures would give him bad dreams. The whole thing was just kind of ""spooky""."
5,"A beautiful, beautiful book","As I was cleaning through old boxes of childhood stuff, I found a tape of myself at 5 years old reading this story to my mom. I became so nostalgic for this book that I had so loved- I remember knowing it entirely by heart.You don't need to have experienced tragedy to love it, you just need to have experienced the whole range of human emotions from fear to sadness to love and joy. A must-read for any child."
5,Great Historical Fiction and Adventure,"Freedom's Cause has a brilliant plot and a fictional character as the protaganist. He starts off as a teen and then grows up through the time of William Wallace and Robert the Bruce. The fictional protagonist interacts with historical characters from that period of Scottish History. The story is full of adventure, friendship, loyalty, honor, heroics, and history. Good values are presented. This book is great for anyone looking for something on Scottish history and which also is an outstanding novel.This book is as excellent or better then any Nigel Tranter book I have read, like The Wallace and The Bruce Trilogy.The accuracy of the historical period is superb and I have read much on this area of Scottish history. The persons discussed, the geography talked about, and the timeline presented is very accurate.I highly recommend this and can't wait to read another Henty."
5,"""Unbelievable!""","This book has open my mind to Henty and the Renaissance. Not only does the writer incredibly and accurately describe the scene but also the characters like it is real life! Once picked up, it is impossible to put down. Archie, Wallace, Bruce and all the others take captive your thoughts. This book is highly reccomended because knowing about history accurately is vital. This book does all of that!"
3,Robert the Bruce,"I enjoyed Braveheart very much and was expecting the sequel Robert the Bruce. After reading this book, I realised that the movie really underestimated William Wallace's role Re: Scotland's Freedom"
4,Once again..It's Tha Nuts,"Alright, I'll keep this brief. This album is actually VERY GOOD. The only thing I've noticed different in comparison to The Originators is the production is better on that album. Their tracks are usually more rawer than this album. Lyrically, nothing's changed still taking you on a flight through a comical storm of sexin, drinking, and smoking. Life's little nessicities, you know. I'm still a Beatnuts fan though. Been one since the Intox Demons EP. Big Ju & Psych didn't let me down on this one. Pick it up, The LP is truely HOT. Especially, the U Nomsayin joint. Parking lot pimps, add this to your collection. Buy it."
4,"thought-provoking, i suppose","this book presents the question: can history repeat itself? i suppose it was thought-provoking on some levels, but it wasn't exactly top-quality literature. a good book for teens, but readers looking for some more elite material should avoid this book."
2,Not an extremly good book,For people who have seen the japanese version of dbz/gt they wont be very pleased with this book nice try but needs a lot more work.
3,Meh....,"Overall, YES this thing works with Roomba with no doubt! But you gotta consider the price is way to high for just a virtual wall unit....."
4,Exactly What It Says,"These days, most Roomba purchases include a virtual wall unit or two. By sending out a radio signal, these units keep the Roomba from crossing some invisible line wherever you set them, keeping the Roomba in one portion of the room, or out of a certain area. I agree with a reviewer who said that it should come with batteries, but at least the battery life seems to be excellent. (Years of moderately frequent Roomba use have required something like two battery changes.)I have a very open design in my house, and the virtual wall is essential to keep Roomba where I want it. If for some reason your Roomba didn't come with these - or didn't come with enough - then I'd recommend picking one up."
3,Good book but not really useful for learning programming.,"I agree with the previous poster's comments on the viability of this book for learning programming. The title is all wrong; it's not specifically about programming! HOWEVER, it is a very good book for those new to Linux in that it answers alot of the questions that new users have. It highlights the many of the strengths of LINUX from a UNIX point of view. i.e. pipes, redirections, job-control, Xconfiguration, programming basics. Patrick Volkerding does a very good job of demonstrating Linux and detailing it's true power. This book should be renamed ""Getting started in LINUX"". If it was...I'd give it five starz!"
4,Fleet Feet,"I've never bought track shoes before and this certainly won't be my last pair. They make you feel faster and more responsive on the track, and for the price and quality buying these shoes was a no-brainer. I think a 1/2 size larger would be more comfortable."
2,"Not the best I've had, not the worst","You'll most likely have this assigned, or you won't be reading this...so since you have no choice in the casebook your prof is using, here's my 2 cents:The book is DRY. Of course, contracts is not the lightest course to assimilate, but I frequently wondered why so many cases and few explanations, instead of the opposite? I'm sure it's possible to learn contract law from this, but if it weren't for the Law School Legends Contracts on tape I probably would not have remembered the dozens and dozens of cases about the same principle. Please, next time attempt READABILITY! If I were a contracts lawyer already I probably would not be buying the casebook, I'd try a treatise!"
1,Worst Contracts Casebook EVER,"How about starting with OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE you worthless casebook?If you haven't taken contracts yet, you don't know what I'm talking about.It'll make sense after you've finished the stupid course."
1,SimpleTech product has very low quality ...,"I bought a simpletech mmc 128mb for my ipaq pa-2 mp3 player. Every time when I transfer a couple of songs, always a few of songs are missing. No matter how many times I tried, it happened every time. So I called for a replacement, Amazon service is very good. I got it in the next few days. However, it happened with the new card too, there are still a few songs missing every time when I transferred songs. So I returned the product today.SanDisk card is very good, the player came with SanDisk 64 mb mmc. It works perfect. I tried a couple of times, no song was missing for even a single time. Unfortunately, I couldn't find SanDisk 128 mb mmc at Amazon. Don't know why it doesn't carry it."
1,Two Defective Cards In A Row,"I bought a simpletech 128 mmc card for my digisette mp3 player. The first one worked, but died after 3 weeks. The second one was dead out of the box, and neither defective card worked on a card reader. Lexar brand worked fine. I was attracted to simple tech because it had the lowest price, but I guess you get what you pay for. Next time I stick with Lexar."
2,I'm a big Dick Francis Fan but SOUND QUALITY atrocious,Were the original TV broadcasts this bad? Cannot believe the sound quality of the video releases.
4,Quick and different,"This is a worthwhile addition to your lace library. The lace is great fun to do. The projects do not take too long to complete and the end result is very attractive. I only wish there were more patterns in the book, and perhaps a bit more guidance on alternative threads."
5,pretty good,I laughed out loud several times and I enjoyed the action scenes. did I mention that Lee Evans is a little annoying but he's hilarious.
1,Possibly the worst movie I've seen.,"I wish I were joking when I say that this is probably the worst movie I've seen (okay, no, House of the Dead was worse, but still) - but I'm not. The jokes are lame, the plot is non exsistant, the action is cheesy (what's going on Jackie??), there are random scenes thrown into this movie that make NO SENSE at all and have absolutely no bearing whatsoever on the movie. The blue screen moments are so bad that you will feel like you're watching something from Mystery Science Theatre 3000. If I could give this ZERO stars, I would because there is nothing redeeming about this movie at all. I'm so sad about it, because normally I'm quite entertained by Jackie Chans work (mostly his Hong Kong work) but this is just trash."
2,Not very memorable,"I love Jackie Chan and all of his movies, buy I will admit this is not one of his best. It's quite bad actually, I bought it cos it was cheap and I like to own all of Jackie's movies in my collection. Not even Claire Forlani could really save this one, she looks totally out of place in this movie. I only recommend it to serious Jackie fans, I couldn't imagine anyone else getting through the whole 85 minutes."
1,It's one of the worst movies starring Jackie Chan,It's one of the worst movies starring Jackie Chan. It's not funny. The fighting scenes are not great either.I regret watching this movie in the theatre.
2,"Oh boy, that's an hour and half I won't get back...","I usually like Jackie Chan movies, clean, funny, action, good stuff. And this one had Claire Forlani, awesome, and then Lee Evans. I think the story line didn't fit the acts and was just too much for people to take in. Acting was okay, but there was just too much far fetched and unanswered questions to make this believible or interesting. Really, skip this movie, don't watch, don't buy!"
1,Eech!,"I can't imagine even the most die-hard Jackie Chan fan getting anything out of this movie. The script was excremental, the plot merely a vehicle for a collection of assorted action scenes, the acting laughable - it's as if the whole thing were written for young children who shouldn't see it in the first place because of all the intense violence. Vast portions of this story make little or no sense.To me, the thing it most resembles is that ""Jackie Chan Adventures"" cartoon show, complete with magical medallion. We might have been better off if they made a movie based on that - at least THOSE characters are interesting, and make sense.Honestly, this movie was so bad, it's Mystery Science Theatre 3000 fodder. It's a shame they don't make that show anymore, as it's the only way I'm ever likely to derive any pleasure out of seeing this movie. Don't waste your time."
1,One of the most ridiculous movies,"This movie was no where near a Jackie Chan-style flick. I don't know if it is because he is getting old or trying to keep up with the ""Matrix-style"" movies, but it was weak. The acting is terrible, the storyline is broken, and the guy from Something About Mary was appalling. Save your money, if you think you need to see it, wait for it to hit TV or maybe the dollar show."
3,Bashful's DVD Summary #023,"Best:1) Jackie doesn't spend a lot of time making his usual goofy faces or doing slapstick routines to entertain.2) The comedy relief is done by a supporting cast of British actors who offer an offbeat twist.3) There's a producer/editor commentary track and 15 deleted scenes.Worst:1) Jackie's medallion-induced superpowers don't kick in until the movie is half over. When they finally do, they're manifested mainly through wire work and simple lighting effects.2) The villians, in general, weren't all that scary. That made the final good guys vs. bad guys showdown unfulfilling.Recommendation:If you're a Jackie Chan fan, you'll want to see this one at least once. Since it's so different from his usual fare (using wires and not clowning around so much), you might think hard before buying it at the full retail price."
5,"just loved it, the best jackie chan movie of recent years",a very great movie. jackie chan hasn't lost a touch yet. the best action movie of 2003 or may be possibly the best movie of this year. a must see for every true jackie chan fan. dont listen to the critics. watch the movie & you will sure love it a lot . watch it. i would recommend it to anybody who is interested in Jackie Chan.
2,Forgettable,"Jackie Chan has really cranked out a lot of movies and I have found some of them quite entertaining with action packed fight scenes, good stories, great stunts, and Chan's self deprecating sense of humor. This is not one of them.There is not much to the plot - Chan is a Hong Kong cop facing off against a super criminal ""Snakehead"". Snakehead is after a medallion that is possessed by a kid. The medallion gives people special powers. Snakehead kidnaps the kid and Chan is in the hunt to save the kid and keep the medallion out of Snakehead's hands.Unfortunately, the plot is awful and makes little sense. The fight scenes are not very good. The movie essentially breaks down into a not very interesting series of vignettes that I could never decide whether they were supposed to be funny, scary, thrilling - they were just plan dumb.Chan would be better served to make fewer, higher quality movies than to churn out forgettable fare like The Medallion."
3,NOT QUITE UP TO MR. CHAN'S STANDARDS,"While I've found myself enjoying the freespirited nature of most of Jackie Chan's films, THE MEDALLION isn't up to par. In fact, it is Lee Evans as Chan's rather inept partner who steals the movie. Reminiscent of Keystone Kops or Jerry Lewis, Evans (Mouse Hunt) is a neurotic and high pitched walking bundle of comic nerves. He brings much needed life to the film; Chan seems a little disoriented and tired at times. The movie's flimsy plot about the powers of an ancient medallion never reaches the frenzie level of some of Chan's earlier films, and Claire Forlani, though quite a lovely actress, doesn't have the fire and verve necessary to be a force to reckon with. But as long as Evans is on the screen, THE MEDALLION is fun."
2,Not one of Jackie's Best,"Jackie Chans latest offering in a kind of Indiana Jones in a Tuxedo sort of movie. Plenty of comedy, action and the usual impressive Chan choreography, but the script is weaker than some of his more recent movies, and this makes the film feel a bit flat. Good fun, but don't get your hopes too high."
3,PROBABLY THE BEST RECENT MOVIE FROM JACKIE CHAN,"AFTER A COP [JACKIE CHAN] DIES, HE IS BOUGHT BACK TO LIFE WITH THE HELP OF A SPECIAL MEDALLION. AND HE IS GIVEN SPECIAL POWERS. THIS IS A LOT BETTER THAN THE TWO SHANGHAI NOON MOVIES. HAS SOME GOOD STUNTS AND SOME FUNNY MOMENTS. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST JACKIE CHAN MOVIES [''THE LEGEND OF DRUNKEN MASTER NOTWITHSTANDING BEING THAT IT WAS NOT AT ALL NEW WHEN IT WAS RELEASED 3 YEARS AGO] THAT'VE BEEN RELEASED IN THE PAST 3 YEARS. THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD EFFORT FROM JACKIE CHAN. IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH WATCHING. JACKIE CHAN'S GOOD FRIEND SAMMO HUNG IS THE ACTION DIRECTOR OF THIS MOVIE."
4,Not the best but still good,"Jackie Chan is not shining in this adventure of his own type (full of fun and action) but elements of supernatural and the way the effects are built upon that makes this move worthed 4 starts. The plot goes well, even if it felt to me as it slowed down unnecessary in the middle of the movie because more time was spent on the hunt for kid instead on pieaces of story on the medalion. Would not go into details of my expirience watiching it because if you are not Jackie Chan fun you would not even see this movie anyway, and if you are you will for sure."
1,Ridiculously bad,"I really like most Jackie Chan movies, but nothing could redeem this stinker. The less said about the plot, the better. The dialogue was awful. And the action scenes aren't even very good. The most enjoyment I got out of this movie was sitting around afterwards drinking to forget and hoping that in our drunken stupors, the movie would magically make sense and be entertaining."
1,"A really, really BIG waste your time....","And when the DVD comes out, don't even think about buying it - this was not just bad but stupid and totally illogical. By the time the flick reaches its' horrendous end, the writers/director don't even try to pretend that they have a story to tell. This was a really BIG waste of Jackie Chan's talent and this is a really BIG insult to anyone with a brain."
1,Another Jackie Chan Mess...,"I don't know why this film is so boring and hard to watch; using the word ""bad"" to describe this film is too harsh. I mean, its not trying to stink, Jackie does his stunts fairly well and the story is not that terrible.Maybe its the really bad acting by the supporting cast or the fact that Julian Sands is wasted in this film? Maybe its the fact that one Jackie Chan film is pretty much like any other Jackie Chan film, a few interesting stunts but nothing new. This film also ended with a thud as well.Don't bother trying on this medallion, its really not worth the money."
1,Absolute rubbish!!,"What the hell was I thinking?Paying to go see the Medallion expect a great Jackie Chan movie.I loved Rush Hour 1 and 2,The Tuxedo was a pretty good film,but this is total crap!The acting is terrible,(Jackie Chan not only can't act,he can't even seem to FIGHT here),and there's no plot whatsoever.Anyway you choose to look at it,this movie sucks!As an action flick,there aren't really any proper fights in it,and as a comedy,it's a one-joke film,with one joke that has been repeated over a million times over 200 years,and was never at all funny to start off with!Don't watch it."
2,Didn't Want To See It,"This movie looked really bad so I didn't even bother seeing it. I mean come on, do I really have to waste 2 hours of my life to know I wouldn't like it? Wise up, people."
3,"Better than ""The Tuxedo""","Although ""The Medallion"" is much better than ""The Tuxedo,"" there are still a few problems. The special effects are good, but to replace Chan's fights with computerized craziness is wrong, and is excessively used in the dull final battle. However, about one third of the movie contains real Chan fights and stunts, including jumping onto a truck, dodging traffic, climbing fences, and leaping through fire. His costar Lee Evans is no Chris Tucker or Owen Wilson, but provides a couple of laughs once in a while. As usual, Jackie is the funniest person in the movie, showcasing his humor during his fight routines. The only other problem with this movie is that Jackie doesn't convert everyday objects into weapons, unlike ""First Strike"", ""Project A"", and many of his other films. Hopefully Jackie's next movie won't resort to him getting superpowers."
2,Tedious Reading.....,"In the beginning this book seemed to have potential. It told of the direct Msonic influence present in the foundation of the Untied States. This was the preface. Afterwards the book endlessly drags on, with dates, times, people, and places; everything except what I expected; a testimony of how Freemasonry affected the establishment of the USA. If you are interested in reading a book that reads like a high school text book, but really goes no deeper, if you are interested in when but not why, maybe you will enjoy. But I doubt it."
2,The Bomber Part was right!!,"This movie was ok, could have been better. It seemed to have a lot of gaps in the storyline. However, it was entertaining. Jason London played a good part. The soundtrack was awesome--but cannot be found. The song ""Timebomb"" was the best!"
4,Toastmaster Mug warmer,"I love having my coffee or tea always perfectly hot to drink. I bought three, one on my desk, one by my chair in front of the TV, one to give as a gift. I have one mug that is too big around, so it doesn't fit on the warmer, so I can't use that. Would be better if the place for the mug was a little larger so more types of mugs could fit."
3,Works ok as a warmer,"Works ok as a warmer if you have 2 hours every time you plug it in but if you need something warmed up quick, I don't think this will do the job for ya."
5,Keeping it warm,It WORKS! I use very large mugs and this product emits enough heat to keep the beverage in a large mug just the right temperature.
1,Terrible,This product came to me right out of the box used and dirty. It looked as if someone had drunk coffee out of the cup. I contacted Amazon and got no help or remedy.[[ASIN:B000EGYRXQ Toastmaster Personal Coffee Mug and Warmer (TMMGW)]
1,Disapointed,"After much research I thought this product would live up to its claims....wrong!I wanted a coffee mug warmer to keep the mug warm, this just doesn't cut it.Barely warm is a better description. I sent it back. Still using my old one that I thought was not working properly. It is better than this one was."
3,Marginal Beverage Warmer,"I ordered this thinking FINALLY I would have a mug warmer that kept my beverage HOT, not so. This is much like any other $8.95 coffee warmer, I can't really tell the difference, it's not worth the extra money. I have several mug warmers, as I like one on my vanity, one in the kitchen and one by my computer. This one sits by my computer now, and I can't tell a big difference from my old Rival mug warmer. All in all I'm disappointed. I thought I would finally have THE mug warmer for me. I like my beverage REALLY warm and this mug warmer is adequate, but not great. I may try the one from the Vermont store that was written about in another review. :("
1,Simply Doesn't Work,I like my coffee HOT. From the first sip to the last. I bought this cuz I get up to microwave my coffee 2 to 3 times per cup and that was getting annoying. Simply put this doesn't keep coffee hot and barely keeps it warm. Unless you just want to keep your lukewarm cup lukewarm then I can't recommend this.
2,"Like every other cofffee ""warmer"" keeps coffee luke warm.",I did my research on coffee warmers and this one according to the reviews was supposed to keep coffee hot! Disappointed... It does keep coffee luke warm....
1,Salton Desktop Cafe Mugwarmer,"The mug was nice, but I am disappointed in the mugwarmer. It does notkeep my coffee hot. If my cup of coffee sits on the warmer 30 minutesbefore I drink it, the coffee is lukewarm when I get around to drinking it. I have to take it to a microwave and reheat the contents before Ican drink the coffee."
2,It works but!,"I bought the warmer 3 months ago, I use it a lot. Over the first two month the plastic rim has cracked twice on the top, now a third crack is developing. This warmer only barely does it's job, ""I like my tea a little hotter"" Now, it's becoming unsightly and it might let spilled liquid leak into the electronics. I don't think it will last a year before it needs to be replaced."
4,Works well,"What's there to say about a mug warmer? It keeps my mug warm! My only complaint (which is minor) is that it is only big enough for a normal-sized mug. If you have a big mug, it won't fit on the mug-warmer.I suppose that it might be nice to have an automatic-off feature, in case you absent-mindedly leave it on, but it's not a feature I've needed yet."
2,not a good choice,"doesn't keep my tea hot, only lukewarm, I had another years ago that worked really well and was very usefull this was not it,"
4,highly recommend,"I love this product, I use it everyday in my office for my coffee it keeps my drink warm. Will recommend it to other."
2,"Warms, Doesn't Heat","When shaving with a straight razor, I mix lather in a ceramic bowl. I wanted a heating pad to keep the lather warm. Coffee heating pads are usually too hot, and they dry the lather. However, I was intrigued by another reviewer who said this product didn't keep coffee warm. Maybe, it would heat lather, but not overheat it?And, this mug warmer works perfectly! It keeps my lather warm, and not hot.But, for heating coffee? Not so good... :("

1,Poor sound quality akin to an 8 track,"A poor introduction to Jefferson Airplane. I was drawn to the group by ""White Rabbit"" with the haunting vocals of Grace Slick but 90% of the C.D. is unimaginative garbage and I recommend talking to some folks familiar with the Airplane's body of work and purchasing selected albums (CD's). As an introduction to the groups body of work, this is a waste of your money."
5,A classic compilation,"I am 16 and all my top favorite rock bands have spanned the 60's, 70's, 80's, and early 90's, such as Queen, Genesis, Billy Joel, and of course, Jefferson Airplane/Starship. I've loved We Built This City and Somebody to Love since I was little, and through this 2 disc set I've heard many high quality rock songs not played to death over the radio, such as White Rabbit, Miracles, Jane, Sara, ect. This is among the best greatest hits choices ever, and highlights a long and fruitful yet tension-filled career spanning a quarter of a century that came to a screeching halt in the early 90's, but produced some of the finest songs ever in its time. No classic rock fan should be without this collection."
3,wanting more,"its as good as gold gets i guess, but I would sure like to see a re-release of what I think is one of Jefferson Starships best albums (nuclear furniture) under headphones the words are great and craigs lead guitar is some of the best by any lead player ever"
2,Do Tell!,"No collection of Rossini Overtures is complete without the William Tell, therefore, this set is highly flawed immediately. To be fair, the Plovdiv Philharmonic Orchestra is not the worst to appear under the DELTA/LASERLIGHT banner, but they're not all that inspiring, either.Two stars ONLY because it's Rossini. Not for the discerning listener."
4,Quite Handy,"Es realmente practico tener el diccionario de la Biblia en el Ipad, Kindle, Cualquier lector, en vez de estar con el libro en si mismo. Pero a veces la ortografia no es muy buena, pero esto no hace imposible su lectura."
5,Que buen diccionario,Este diccionario a sido una buena herramienta para profundizar en el estudio de la Santa Biblia gracias por este diccionario.
5,"intimate, honest and delightful","All the accolades are right on. If you can find Glad in that fantastic jam into Freedom Rider you are better than me. If recorded in 2008, sound would obviously be better, but the tunes are like gold, camera work delectable and everything is technically very good."
5,Classic Traffic,"Wonderful record of a wonderful (and rare) live performance by one of the most multi-talented bands of the era. Rock, jazz, blues, british folk, fusion at its best. And a chance to see Steve Winwood at one of his creative peaks. Highly recommended."
1,2 strikes for Amazon,"I would have loved to have viewed Traffic, Live at Santa Monica, but unfortunately, I opened the Traffic DVD case only to find that someone had substituted some absolutely awful Hair band by the name of Cinderella. This is the second time this has happened in the past 12 months. I have only had this trouble with Amazon music DVD's. Both times were Amazon direct purchases. This is the second strike. Good luck. I still have high hopes of seeing Traffic, 1972 vintage."
2,disappointed,"Didn't realize when I ordered it that it was from Children's Press, and so geared toward an 8th grade level reader.It did cover the basics, though, and it is extrememly hard to find any books on this wonderful little country called Slovenia.So, it was somewhat helpful."
2,Not as good as others in the series,"I checked this out of the library, as I have others in this series, prior to travelling on a trip to that particular country. Although I haven't been a youth for a number of years, I find these books a good introduction prior to travel. That being said, this was the weakest one I have read, keeping fully in mind the age group it is written for. It is fairly shallow, and I did not get the in depth history of the country that I have with others (Croatia and the Czech Republic). I don't feel I know the history as well as I did with the others."
1,Not recommended,This item didn't work very well and I returned it the day after I received it. I subsequently purchased a Plantronics System S12 that I would recommend.
4,Mojave Crossing,"Classic story by L'amour where the hero manages to struggle through extremely difficult circumstances to win in the end because of toughness, ingenuity and skill."
5,One of L'Amours best,You absolutely cannot go wrong with anything Louis L'Amour writes whether you like westerns or not. But you can go even one step higher with any of the Sackett titles and this is one of the best!
5,Reading all night,Any one who has spent any time in the Mojave can relate to this story of tring to stay alive.
3,"gee, it never gets started","200 pages into the book and I was still wondering when he was going to tell us aboutwhat Fred was really known for ( Efficiency theory).Most of the book seems to be taken with excusing Frederick Winslow Taylorfor not understanding why there was a union movementin an America of 12 hour days and child labor.The Japanese think the fellow is just fine and have resurrected him as an Icon.His downfall seems to have been cursing at a Congressmanin a Congressional hearing on labor practices.People were dying in factories everywhere in Americaduring this era of overwork and under pay.I don't think that ""Sloan Technology"" is going to be successful inthis hero resurrection. It is just sorry that a good biographer shouldhave taken this job. His Ramanujan book was really good."
3,Feminism clashes with victorianism.,"For the time it was written The Rainbow must have been quite controversial. Themes such as sexual promiscuity and homosexuality are dealt with.The story is of three generations of tempremental women coming to terms with their own sensuality and femminism.Like most of the books of that generation that were written by British authors, the prose is beautiful and poetic. But unlike its predecessors, the female characters are strong and femminism is a central theme.Personally, I prefer American writers such as Twain, London, or Steinbeck who create more beleivable and down to earth characters.I just do not seem to enjoy the stories of Wolfe, Hardy, and Lawrence, although I do appreciate their prose."
2,Not a masterpiece,"I have read others of Lawrence's books and thoroughly enjoyed them, but this one bored me to tears. It was not only repetitive, but unnecessarily florid, slow, and melodramatic. Here is a sample:""Gradually she realised that her life, her freedom, was sinking under the silent grip of his physical will. He wanted her in his power. He wanted to devour her at leisure, to have her. At length she realised that her sleep was a long ache and a weariness and exhaustion, because of his will fastened upon her, as he lay there beside her, during the night. She realised it all, and there came a momentous pause, a pause in her swift running, a moment's suspension in her life, when she was lost.""And it goes on and on and on like this, unto the third generation. No doubt all this purple prose was extremely erotic in its day, but none of these characters seem at all real to me, and there is no plot to make up for the lack. For me, this was one big waste of time."
3,unintended consequence,"Besides the history of a family over three generations, the key character is Ursula. In the early 1900s just before WW1, she is a ""feminist"" before her time. We find that she rejects marriage, engages in premarital sex, conducts a homosexual affair, and ""objectifies"" men. She is also non-religious and probably never has children. My point is not that she understands the human need to be a strong independent individual and does so, but that in the process of her female emancipation, she loses her ability to love a man and be loved in return. It is sad that in her search and rebellion against the traditional gender roles, she loses sight of the human need to bond."
2,"Been there, done that.","I don't know if D.H Lawrence was just a man without breadth or depth of imagination, but why does this novel, over five-hundred pages long, only consist of throbbing, inflamed souls, and entangled sinners bonking in the haystacks?You see, I'm a fan of D.H Lawrence, but I cannot comprehend whyever this book was (A) published and, (B), banned. The Rainbow is a book that is simply TOO stuffed with Freudian thought, and simply TOO concerned with implied incest and the kind of base themes a perverted teen could think of in under ten minutes. I completely and totally do NOT recommend this book. If you want something definitive of Lawrence's career, read Sons and Lovers. The same themes are repeated there, but not quite as stupidly."
5,Fantastic Gift For Irish Moms and Grandmas,"I bought this for my Grandmother-In-Law who is Irish. My friend also purchased one for her mother. Both gift recipients were thrilled and read the book immediately. I think I'll pick up ""Cabbage and Bones"" next."
5,Well worth the reading for Nautical fans!,"I have just finished this book, the seventh in the series, and enjoyed it thouroughly. More intrigue than sea battles, but an exciting climax to several story lines throughout the series. Any fan of O'Brien or Forester is encouraged to dive into Woodman."
1,Font Nightmare,"Just about the single worst font product I have ever had the displeasure of using (and I've used every Mac font manager on the market for over a decade). Extensis Font Reserve server redefines the words SLOW and BUGGY, completely trouncing the record heretofore held by long time heavyweight champion, Suitcase 2.1.3 from way back in the halcyon days of the mid 1990s . Completely unreliable. Frequent unexplained errors, freezes and crashes and other generally bizarre and thoroughly upsetting behavior. If you're familiar with network computing and know why it never took off, you will understand why Extensis Font Reserve Server is a complete and utter disaster. If you think you're getting too much work done, just install this product and get ready to sloooooowwww dooooowwwwnn.If someone offers you this product, run screaming into the night."
5,Great product,"Needed the rod to build a jig for my router. I was surprised at the low price. Came EXCELLENTLY packaged, and worked perfectly for my project."
2,All showstoppers in search of a show,"I'm adding my two-cents here just because the other reviewers are too generous. While it's hard to hate the Ellington band, especially during the period of 1957-59, when it was stuffed with talented soloists and Duke was clearly feeling inspired, this album of charts put together solely to evoke excitement among big, unsophisticated festival crowds comes across as just that: over-the-top, shrill and, ultimately, rather exhausting. Sure, there's some exciting playing here, particularly from Clark Terry and Paul Gonsalves, but it's all in the ""more-is-more"" mode. After a decent rendition of ""Perdido"", it quickly wears out its welcome. I mean, who buys an Ellington album to hear an extended drum battle between two drum kits? Yikes. Best Duke studio album of this period is still probably Blues in Orbit, and best live recording is perhaps the At the Blue Note set."
2,Another crappy Lo Wei Jackie movie,"This one really sucked, though the storyline isn't the worst, but the action just sucks. It starts out really good and we are treated to a tournament with 1 guy whoopin on everyone, but he dies and it just gets worse and worse. A lot of really crappy fights and then the end. The last fight might be good, but I don't even remeber this sucked so much. Like I said, decent story, but no execution whatsoever."
3,Shortened Dragon Fist,"...Some yahoo at the studio cut out almost 20 minutes from the already cut version, which runs 94 mins. I have to admit seeing it once again in widescreen, 2.35:1, with a pretty good print may be worth it. I guess it was for me. But, the 18 mins. missing make you wonder what the heck's going on when it just jumps to fight scenes for no reason whatsoever. And why is Chan doing what he's doing? (I'm not giving anything away). Buy the fullscreen version to get the full story. When I first saw this in the theater, some twenty years ago, it was a pretty good kung fu movie. Chan did not use wires and his fighting style was unique. This is a pre-comedic Chan. Nice to see a serious Chan. Produced by Lo Wei, the producer of a few early Bruce Lee movies."
3,Good drama,"This story is basically a good drama, with action/kung fu scenes supporting the story, which is unusual for a Lo Wei directed Jackie picture and for the Hong Kong 70s kung fu genre as a whole!! Jackie gives a good dramatic performance, though as it is basically his first, is not terrific. Please note the 3 stars are for Jackie and the story, not for the DVD itself. 20 or so minutes (which explains why a lot of the action happens) have been cut from this version. This is typical of US distributed Jackie movies I have found. Check out Amazon.co.uk for recently produced DVDs (including this one) which are not cut. They are PAL format though. If you are a rabid Chan-fan, and like to see Jackie stretching himself a little beyond the typical action/comedy/stunt scenario then this movie is a must see and won't disappoint, even in its reduced format."
4,Dragon Fist,This is one of Jackie Chan's earlier films and he really does a lot more Kung Fu fighting than he does in his later films. I really enjoyed watching this one and would recommend this to any Jackie Chan fan to have in their collection.
3,Boring movie about a serial killer who died without being prosecuted and thrown in the slammer...,"Jake Gyllenhaal and Robert Downey Jr. are both attractive actors so maybe you should watch it just to see them. But if I was to tell you that this movie was exciting and thought-provoking, I'd be lying through my Kool-Aid-stained teeth!It has a plot and follows it, and in the beginning it creates the illusion that this movie is gonna get good. And it does but they only serve it to you in small spurts.Eventually, Jake's character gets so hooked on this case and the Zodiac, the he starts heavily neglecting his family and their lives. But it could've been worse: he could've been an abusive drunk who every morning, noon and night, went upside his old lady's head. Thank goodness that that wasn't the case.Anyway, the movie has a few decent parts, takes a few interesting turns but ultimately leaves you bored. And they never find the killer either.3.5 stars."
3,Too long makes this film forgettable.,"Zodiac directed by David Fincher starts off really well even though the first 30 minutes are the most violent but as the film goes on, the characters become too cluttered and the progression is a bit slow and lackluster. I have always liked Fincher's films but this one doesn't flow well and since the San Franciso Police Department never found out the identity of the Zodiac killer, you kinda expected an ambivalent ending. The use of the song, Hurdy Gurdy Man by Donovan is played many times during the film, and that song is perfect and kept me watching this film the whole way through. There are some great performances by Jake Gyllenhaal and Mark Ruffalo but sadly even their acting can't save this so-so film."
3,drawn out,"real crime stories can be interesting and educational, but I found this movie to be drawn out a little too much. I had no problem with the acting except that it was difficult to identify with the little bits that they portrayed. with that said, this movie was like true life - there isn't always a satisfactory ending."
3,I really wanted to like this,"Zodiac's first hour or so was excellent, however once the killer's populatrity dwindled so did my interest in the film, and the last hour and a half of the cartoonist looking for clues draaaaaaaaged on. The film does a good job of showing the public stop caring about the Zodiac killer but it's not good at keeping my interest in it for two and a half hours. Thanks Dave but I think I'll stick with Se7en."
5,Worth Watching,"All of Fincher's commentaries are worth listening to. He's interesting and a true iconoclast. All the extras help to illustrate a very good film. The ending is frustrating, because it's a murder mystery without knowing who the killer is. That, of course, is the intention. Watch this and then go see Benjamin Button."
3,"Way to long, decent acting, but just not a great story.","I just didn't like this movie all that much. I knew some details about the Zodiac killer before I saw the movie, essentially that the killer had never been found. I wondered how they could make a film out of an unsolved crime. And that question is the essential flaw of this film. One, the film is 157 minutes long...and the conclusion is as I knew it when I started, No Killer found. So they built the drama and action in the movie around who it ""could be"". Eh, who cares, catch me a killer. And somewhere about halfway through, I just didn't care what Gyllenhaal's character did...I just thought the guy was stupid for wrecking his marraige for nothing...he accomplishes nothing. Am I suppose to feel sorry for him giving up his life to find a killer and failing. Oh well, I guess if I didn't know the history, this may have been interesting, but I did, so this movie was long, and ended just as expected, very blah. rent this one."
3,"If You've Read The Book, Don't Bother With The Movie","I had a very difficult time getting past the arrogance in Robert Graysmith's book (on which this movie was based and named) and was relieved to see the same self-boosting egotistical writing had not been used in the creation of this movie. Yet, it still had a difficult holding my attention.Viewers of this movie are simply not given enough to become personally attached to the characters or the outcome. In a movie such as this, you don't want to just see it..you want to FEEL it; and it's absent here from beginning to end.This is one of those movies that I recommend watching when there is nothing else available. It's okay, but don't expect a masterpiece."
5,Zodiac Movie,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie, since I really hadn't heard any reviews on it. I was gladly surprised, had me interested the entire 2 hours and 37 minutes. Great movie."
2,Too long,"Way too long for what it has to say. After all this is not Shakespeare. Serial killers, interesting as they are in reality, do not make for successful film making. It gets a bit tedious and one dimmensional after you realize things are going nowhere. That 4 or 5 year interval gives the actor a chance to over act and over re-act and the audience a chance to get a beer.Terrific cinematography as always from Fincher. Great music track. No 'Seven' no 'Manhunter' but it wanted to be."
3,Zodiac great film but DVD encoding poor!,"Once again, just like it happened with Mission Impossible 3, Paramount Home Video puts out a terrible DVD video transfer. The image is full of rippling and jaggies and shimmering artifacts!. The video is sharp but looks like the older transfers before the days of progressive anamorphic encoding. This is not acceptable by 2007 DVD standards. I am hoping the studio is planning a High Definition release which hopefully will be a clean transfer of this absolutely fantasctic suspense thriller. One of the best films of the year!!!"
4,Overlooked gem of 2007,Most people missed this unique gem from one of cinema's great visionary directors. David Fincher arguably delivers his most mature film in this fascinating and beautiful crime drama about obsession. One of the top films of 2007.
2,What happened?,After spending over two and a half hours watching the movie it degenerated into three screens of small illegible text. They may as well have placed the text after the first half hour and I would be left in the same situation. Had I wanted to read the book I would have bought the book. Tip to directors: If you cannot end the story by telling the story through the screen play don't make the movie.
3,I expected more,"After years of pondering the Zodiac murders, I thought that this movie was going to bring all the pieces together by placing the final piece into the puzzle. So I was really disappointed that the final piece still leads to the person the law and writers always thought it was....But with no true ending. But it's a good movie."
3,Could have been better,"Acting was great in this movie. I love the way they accurately portrayed the era, but the movie was just too slow moving."
2,Disappointing,"All I can say is disappointing, very disappointing. Maybe I had too high of hopes for this movie, it definately fell short on all accounts."
1,BEWARE: Won't Play on regular DVD or Blu Ray players,"The Zodiac (two disk Director's cut) HD DVD will not play on regular DVD or Blu Ray players. There should be a Caution on the listing but there is not. OOPS,I guess someone noticed and now there is an ""ALERT"". It's a hard way to learn that HD means that it takes a specific HD player. Granted Amazon does take it back but they charge the shipping and you have to pay the shipping back---so that's not a good deal."
1,Too Long and Boring...,"...the two deadliest sins of movie making. After reading the reviews I had really high hopes. Man, were they ever dashed! Forty-five minutes or so into the flick I didn't care what happened. I was actually thinking of walking out. An hour later I was kicking myself for not acting on my instinct. IMHO this movie stinks!"
1,Save Your Money,"This flick is just gosh awful! I had such high hopes for it, given thecast, but the film is totally sabotaged by poor direction.R. Downey Jr. mumbles nearly all of his lines with a cigarette in his mouth, so don't count on understanding him. Other characters rival hismumbling as well. The film is too long, should have been edited down to2 hrs max. Too many subtitles are so miniscule as to be illegible most of the time. And the lighting? Just awful. Too bad this work which had potential is such a failure!"
1,Just awful,"This is perhaps the worst movie that I have ever had the displeasure to watch. The script is erratic, if indeed this monstrosity was filmed using a script. For example, there appear to be two, mutually exclusive, endings to the film. One is left wondering why the first is included. Also, the film seemingly never ends -- it wanders aimlessly for hours.The quality of the cinematography is terrible. The camera is more often out of focus than in. The color is terrible and the sound simply is not there.Save your money, time and sanity. Just say no."
4,Zodiac comes to San Francisco,"This film is long enough to require a pot of coffee and two bowls of rice. This is not to say that it is boring or slow. This film is a steady-paced unfolding of real life events concerning the Zodiac killer on the cusp of the sixth and seventh decades of the previous century. The actors chosen for this film are all a perfect fit for the story and the director did an excellent job.For those readers who need a comparison, we would like to mention the films 'Se7en' and 'Silence of The Lambs'. We feel that it is in quite contrast with 'Summer of Sam', which is a horrible film. Zodiac is a film that will appeal to those viewers who enjoy movies about solving a crime or even cracking a code. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a user rating of 92% with 3% estimated from Vegans.All Resistors are expected to observe Zodiac along with a pot of coffee and two bowls of rice. Michaelmatician states that Zodiac has defined the year 2007 in film.2.342"
1,This DVD wins the Cynical Rip-Off Awards hands down!,"Zodiac lovers beware! This bare-bones release (not bad in itself, mind you) only offers a few previews as extra features - okay, no big deal so far, but wait! The very first of those is none other than the preview... of the forthcoming 2-disc Extended Director's Cut loaded with extras, interviews, commentaries and tons of groovy stuff, to be relased next year. In other words, the first thing you get when you play this DVD is a very clear message that you have just been buying the wrong DVD. Now how's that for cynical?On second thoughts, one could argue that it's not really better to get that kind of information only several months later when the Extended Cut or Special Edition comes out with little advance notice - and you find you have to fork out(much)more money to buy the same movie yet once more..."
1,NO FRILLS DVD,"The film is fantastic--I'd argue Fincher's best--but fans might want to wait for the deluxe edition DVD that is coming out after the new year featuring the director's cut of the film and hours of special features. This is the ""no frills"" version of the DVD. It contains the flick and nothing else. This is just studio double dipping."
1,Price was good got it fast,The disk didn't play I tried to fix but got nothing. I should probably send it back but it's only a few bucks so I won't bother.
3,"Good, but a little long","Zodiac is long. Maybe it just felt longer because I happened to be tired when I saw it. I am not going to sit through it again just to find out. Luckily it also happens to be very good with an excellent cast. There are no crazy car chases, shootouts, or fancy explosions and you don't even get the satisfaction of the capture of the Zodiac, yet it is still a solid film. What you get is a story that follows the methodical progress of police work and the investigation of a cartoonist turned journalist."
5,The Best Puppy Pads.,These are the best puppy pads I could find anywhere. I have purchased almost every other brand and found that Simple Solutions makes the best of them all. With the price on Amazon with the 4 for 3 offer and the Simple Solutions frequent buyers rebate of $1 back on every bag purchased the price remains unbeatable. The quality is much better than Hartz or any brand. Anyone that purchases these will not be disappointed.
3,McGruff's album,"I finally picked up this album a few days ago..and it's everything i expected it to be. Mediocre. There are however, a few jams on here(the track with Big L and Mase 'Danger Zone' being the best one). So, i guess if you're a really big fan of Big L this is worth getting."
3,ONE OF THE MOST SLEPT ON MC'S IN THE GAME,"McGruff is one of the best mc's in the game today. although because of label conflicts(uptown), he wasn't publicized as much as his other HARLEM WORLD COUNTERPARTS. NONETHELESS DON'T SLEEP ON HIM."
5,Don't listen to anybody but me,"McGruff is the best kept secret in rap over the last 11 years. His flow is simply flawless, just as good as the likes of Big L, Biggie, and some of the greatest rappers your ears have ever heard. ""Destined to be"" is truly one of rap's hidden gems. If you liked Notorious B.I.G., you will love this CD, I'd bet my life on it. Also check out both of Nature's CD's and the last 2 Masta Ace CD's for more sleeper classics. Oh yeah, and Sticky Fingaz's ""Kirk Jones"" is also a must have. Some of the best CD's of all time, no b.s. I'D BET MY LIFE ON ALL OF THEM!!!!!!! DON'T LET PERCEIVED NEGATIVE THOUGHTS MAKE YOU HESITATE FROM GETTING ALL THESE CD'S RIGHT NOW. I'VE BEEN COVERING RAP FEVERISHLY THE LAST 15 YEARS!!!!!!! YOU WILL THANK ME LATER!"
1,Wack to the bone,"This album makes no sense at all. The lyrics is all about cristal, get my mack on, and leaving the whole block wetto (whatever that means). This album is not for the average hip hop head. By the way, who in the world would go so far in wearing a mink (the mink is tighter than a chickenhead with a bubble northface) with a baseball cap and sneakers."
4,Amazing...,"This is not a typically Uriah Heep record, but you should listen the details... a lot of keyboard arrangements, the pulsing of Trevor Bolder and Lee Kerslake sounds... The voices around the music...Poor Little rich girl is a sound that shows how the musicians build a road for the vocals - Beautiful arrangement.Please be advised: this is a chance for good entretainement - but please: listen twice and in details before evaluate."
4,Fond recollections,"Tom Coffey has written long and well about his native city with incredible fondness. He covers a host of issues about this unique Southern City from its Historic District, lovely trees, politics, City Hall management, race issues, sports, education and more.As a long time journalist and a short term City Administrator, he brings first hand knowledge of the ins and outs of this colorful City, full of personality."
1,Official Guide to Hiking the Grand Canyon,"What a dissapointment this book turned out to be. One would think the ""ultimate"" guide to hiking would contain detailed trail descriptions and suggested itineraries. The second sentence in the book says it all, ""...provides basic information...""This book provides very little in the way of interesting land marks and ""must sees"" for a trip to the Grand Canyon."
4,Supernatural mystery,Dougray Scott did a good job in this. Was very interesting and kept you in suspense.
4,Refreshing vamp flick,"This was a great new on the vampire concept that introduced and explored some great ""what ifs"". Like what if science sent us technologically backwards and we all embraced the church? The plot runs the line of Jack the Ripper, but with some unique twists. In some ways it looked like a dirty 'Ultraviolet'...except with a bit more plot and a lot less stylized fights.For people who love vampire flicks that actually contribute to the vampire genre in insightful ways rather than for the use of a cheap monster movie this one's for you. The actors made some great character choices and the direction did a good job making sure everything flowed together...that and the use of wires added just the polish this movie needed to give the vampires a sense of style."
4,"Review of ""Perfect Creature""","This is a very graphic suspense-thriller, filmed in New Zeland, that adds a bold new twist to the vampire myth. Three centuries ago, human genetic experimentation gave rise to an advanced species known as the Brotherhood. They lived in harmony with humans, protecting them from disease while relying on them for sustenance. This balance between man and vampire is threatened when Brother Silus (Dougray Scott) learns that one of his kind has unleashed a deadly virus that is killing off humans. This film, made in 2007, is mostly unheard of in the United States. Starring Dougray Scott, Saffron Burrows, Leo Gregory, Scott Wills, and Stuart Wilson, this film is worth watching!"
2,Perfect Creature--Not worth buying...,"Do not buy this movie. Although it had an interesting/original plot, the movie was low budget and was in a nutshell, boring. Wait to see it on cable for free, don't waste your money buying it."
4,Hard to find and out of date...,"But I liked this film. It was made too late to be successful, I think. I really liked several of the scenes, which were well directed and played. I was pleasantly surprised that I liked Dougray Scott as a vampire, especially one in this very, very different (and refreshing) play on vampires. No sparkles here!"
3,Style over substance,"Perfect creature is a very visual film, set in an alternate reality somewhere around 1900. Here Vampires belong to the Brotherhood, they look after the human race and are the focus of all religion. Part of the agreement is that people donate blood to the Brotherhood and do this willingly and it is a great honour. Never has a Vampire taken a human life - until now.Again the setting is terrific, costumes are good and this alternate reality is a harsh impoverished place. For the setting the film gets top marks.What I found troubled me is that the film is like watching a docudrama about the alternate reality because it lacked almost all suspense. It has an evil vampire but only a few scenes have much to get excited about, and towards the end there are hardly any at all.It makes for an o.k. viewing but I really don't know how to classify it, it isn't horror, probably more like drama - with vampires. Not very good at all."
4,Not bad with Saffron Burrows,"Saffron Burrows from Boston Legal stars in Perfect Creature as a police officer who is hunted by a rather powerful vampire. While this movie does get dull in parts, the fight scenes are very good. Plus, Burrows is quit pleasant to look at.I rate this movie with 4 stars-"
2,Too Busy,"Production was great, the storyline was too intricate and assumes that the viewer can buy off too many fantastic concepts. Kind of a stinker."
2,don't be decieved.,"Only thing this movie had going for it was cinematography, the story was just AWFUL. Seriously not worth the buy. I expected from the good rating it would be good, but was unpleasantly thwarted from this view. The acting is awful as well. music was good though, so I guess it had that too."
5,Perfect chiller!,"This vampire movie is heavier on the suspense than the gore (which is unique in a movie about 'bloodsuckers'). It also focuses on characters rather than just relying on shock and awe action. Edgar is a 'bad vampire' in an alternate world where vampires have managed to live side by side with humans. However, with all the prejudice still there from '300 years ago' when people tried their best to wipe out vampires, Edgar threatens to upset the balance. A clever Sci-fi/Horror that leaves room for a good sequel.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
2,2 stars for interesting dialogue and good acting.,"This movie was well acted and had some interesting dialogue. However, the major problem is the extremely slow and weak plot. The movie progresses too slow and the movie has very little character development and action. The special effects are sparse and rarely utilized to its maximum potential. It's not in the league as The Breed, Underworld, The Hunger, or Interview with the Vampire. Rent before you purchase it for your vampire movie collection. Grade: C-"
3,"Interesting, but only so-so.","Intersting horror movie made and set in New Zealand, albeit one with an alternate history. Present day humans living along side a religious order comprised soley of vampires. A crazy uber-vampire gets out of control and begins murdering humans as well as his own kind. This upsets the balance between humans and vampires. The atmosphere is eerily depressing in it's dystopian view of a present day New Zealand that is a cross between Victorian-era Britain and Britain during the 1940's. Saffron Burrows is captivating, but to be honest I love her in anything she's in. Dougray Scott is fine too. The problem with this movie though is that for a horror movie it isn't very scary. It was fairly enjoyable, but I can't really recommend it. However, for the special download price of 1.99, it was more than worth it."
2,"Oh brother, where art thou!","This is a visually stylish movie that puts an interesting spin on the vampire myth. Unfortunately this new mythology is underused and this is, in effect, just another 'hunt the monster' movie. In this respect it is moderately successful but suffers a couple of major flaws. Neither Scott nor Burrows have been suitably cast. Both are talented actors but neither is able to bring their derivative characters to life, despite their best efforts. Scott is forced to recite some woefully portentous, painfully enunciated dialogue, and Burrows has to perform a stereotypical hard-nosed but damaged cop routine. Ally this with a rather predictable plot and the whole thing is bit of a let down. On a brighter note, the ending blatantly paves the way for a sequel. Let's hope they can improve on this promising but underdeveloped beginning."
3,Not the original music soundtracks,These are not the original music soundtracks.For this being a remake it isn't bad and I do enjoy listening to this CD.If you are looking for original music soundtracks you might be dissapointed.If you enjoy western music you might like this.The CD sound is ok but could be better.
4,Hot Solo Songs From Dave,"Dave Wakeling, formerly of English Beat and General Public has put together a collection of catchy songs that are all readily listenable and memorable. ""I Want More"" and ""Sex With You"" are standouts while ""She's Having a Baby"" from the treacly movie is less moving.If the Beat and GP got your feet moving this will too.(The other review posted for this disc seems to be referring to some other disc- best ingore it.)"
4,"good record, better then suffer survive","when i first heard of this band it was when their first single came out from suffer survive. i liked the single and liked the cd, but when i heard this, i noticed it was alot harder and more screaming. being i like harder music this cd is deffinatly more my style. i still like the new one, but this one is a bit better. i hear they put on an awesome show too. i recommend checking this cd out."
1,Not Suggested...,"I was not impressed with this study guide. I have taken 3 CLEP exams, and if I had only studied this guide for Biology I would have failed miserably. I used this in conjunction with an AP Biology study guide by REA and passed, but don't rely on this alone."
5,Finally some plain talk instead of sound bites.,"This was a welcome book for someone who was confused about by all the political gas and Malthusian rants surrounding this somewhat new ""issue."" Climatology is a field in its infancy and to date all I had been able to read that was credible science (most notably in Science magazine) was quite frankly too technical and weighted down by mathematics to connect with the layman. This book, by people who actually study the Earth's climate, is actually written at a level most of us can understand if we concentrate and with a little flair for humor to boot.If you go into it with an open mind you'll find it very thought provoking."
4,Read this and quit worrying,"Michaels and Balling offer a refreshing alternative to the alarmist screaming that comes from some over the issue of global warming. Through comprehensive analysis of the data and theory behind the issue, the authors find that climate change from industrial activity won't be the dramatic planet threat many think.They acknowledge that carbon dioxide levels in the atmophere are increasing. However, they think global temperature will only increase 1.3 decrees Celsius by 2100. They do not think ocean levels will rise enough or fast enough to endanger people. Their findings also allow them to believe that storms may actually decrease in intensity and increased carbon dioxide may encourage plant life.The Satanic Gases is a fine bit of science presented in a persuasive manner."
3,Watch out,"I'd like to ask anyone who is not concerned about global warming to read the accounts of the last meltdown under Noah in the old testament, or in the Bhagavad Gita or any other ancient religious work (which all started as oral history). Archeologists agree that around 10,000 years ago sea levels rose 400 to 600 feet and probably very suddenly. Noah is just the oral history of that event. Most scientists are unfamiliar with catastrophe theory (a very simple theory which describes that in nature events happen very precipitously). Nature is much like the stock market with sudden unpredictable spurts.Ice is a good conductor of heat and has a high latent heat capacity and thus a whole ice sheet (eg Antarctica) must heat up before it melts (very suddenly). Ice has some other interesting properties that make it unpredictable. As we do not understand what caused the last meltdown, anyone who thinks they can reassure us categorically about the next one is dangerous indeeed."
1,Don't bother...,"Yawn...I only picked this up because Tia Carrere is in it. But she's not in all that much of it, so it's almost a poor excuse to spend money on. Tia looks great as always, but the plot is awful, stupid, and just plain idiotic. You could put a Barney video on and have more fun."
3,The Magic Light Show,"Before purchasing the DVD, I would have liked to have known the year the movie was produced. The show seems a little dated (not a high tech production), however, the content seems age appropriate for fifth graders. The concepts covered in the video were exactly what I was looking for. There's a fun magic trick that I think the students at this age will enjoy."
3,It's alright,"After a decade of bad reviews, a declining of the fan base, and almost ten years away from the lime light, Phil Mogg recruited long time and once original member Pete Way (bass), Laurence Archer (guitar), and Clive Edwards (drums) to record another album. ""HIGH STAKES & DANGEROUS MEN"" was released in 1992 but it didn't have the impact Mogg wished for. Several years later, Mr. Mogg says that this album is his favourite one together with ""LIGHTS OUT"" and ""THE WILD, THE WILLING AND THE INNOCENT"". I don't think UFO fans in general agree with Mogg that ""HIGH STAKES..."" is one of the finer but it is not a bad album.With songs like the melodic ""Don't want to lose you"", the bluesy ""Borderline"" (the album's highlight) and the classic sounding ""Primed for time"" among others, this album is rather enjoyable even if it's far from UFO's best work."
3,Collection worthy,"As the title explains this recording is worthy of a space in your UFO collection in order to complete it and an occassional or frequent listen, but otherwise concentrate on other more necessary recordings. LIGHTS OUT IN TOKYO contains the best five tracks and they all both sound better and have more vibrant energy. The two killer tracks that did not make LIGHTS OUT and make this worth buying are PRIMED FOR TIME and LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL. The guitar player for this period is Lawrence Archer is very good and blew me away on the live record. PHIL should have kept him around or at least went back to him after and in between his one night recording stands with Schenker. It would at least have kept the feeling of a band there. This means for MOGG-WAY and SIGN OF FOUR also. If tis review applies to you, then purchase HIGH STAKES AND DANGEROUS MEN."
3,not great but not a stinker,"this was better than there last one which was an ep basically. This one doesn't have the stand out tracks that even their 83 very good one did. (making contact) It's ufo for sure though with mogg on the lead vocals and it's not bad melodic metal. It's not up to their 73-83 standards perhaps but it's still decent hard rock. However when I first heard it I was not as happy with it as the their next one which is great ""walk on water' , this one isn't bogus though as the one star reviewers and particularily the guy who capitalized every letter said it was. Ok, it's not great, it's just average metal that doesn't stand out mostly. But it's sitll better than most thrash metal."
1,WHAT CD ARE YOU RATING?,"BEFORE I BEGIN, I NEED TO MENTION THAT I AM A HUGE UFO FAN - OK, WITH THAT SAID, I'LL TRY TO BE NICE ABOUT MY RATING OF THIS CD - SIMPLY PUT, THIS CD STINKS, AND HAVING THE LETTERS U.F.O. ON THE FRONT COVER MAKES ME EVEN SICKER - I HAVE FOLLOWED THIS GROUP FOR YEARS AND HAVE EVERY SINGLE ALBUM THEY EVER PUT OUT - EXCEPT THIS ONE WHICH I SOLD TO A CD TRADE STORE FOR TWO DOLLARS - I WON'T ALLOW A CD LIKE THIS TO BE IN MY COLLECTION - I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH HOW BORING THIS WAS AND HOW EVERY SONG SOUNDED THE SAME - IT'S NOT UFO, AND DON'T LET ANYONE TRY TO TELL YOU THAT - I LOVE THE SCHENKER ERA UFO AND MUCH OF THE LATER STUFF, BUT THIS CD WAS A MISTAKE - I HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE SCORPIONS, UFO AND MSG FANS WHO FEEL THE SAME WAY, SO IT'S NOT MY IMAGINATION RUNNING WILD - I LISTENED TO IT A FEW TIMES THINKING IT WOULD GROW ON ME, AND IT PUT ME TO SLEEP - I HIGHLY RECOMMEND AVOIDING THIS CD UNLESS YOU DON'T LIKE UFO - THEN THIS CD MIGHT BE WORTH MORE TO YOU."
2,"Uh, close, kind of","I was really excited about this CD because I love UFO, and I also love Thin Lizzy. Now, after Thin Lizzy's implosion, Grand Slamm emerged with Phil Lynott (RIP) and Laurence Archer. This band had some promise, yet never truly recorded. Fast forward about 10 years and Lawrence Archer is now UFO's guitarist! However the album is WEAK! Save your money and buy something else. This is pop, not rock, and not metal. This really cannot be called UFO as it truly is a UFO tribute band in my estimation. It is hard to criticize the boys, but at any rate KEEP ON ROCKIN'!"
2,When more is not better,"Finally the price on this title has gone down, although Amazon does still list the more expensive copy. It is the exact same video. At the lower price, its worth a try if you really need a baby sitter to work out with. While the workout can be intense, it is also very very long and more time than most would want to continually stay with. The additional two performers also appear to be just that, performers and not actual yoga practioners, as evidenced by their less than stable examples of the exercises. The look of the video is nice, but it that what we want out of an exercise video? I think not. Stick with more basic workouts and you'll be much more satisfied, because you'll stick with it. This one is just too long!"
2,Not so warm,"I hoped to solve the cold-foot problem of standing in Minneapolis waiting for the bus. I thought these boots were promising. They are fine in temperatures above freezing but when it gets down to 20 degrees F, they are not warm enough for bus travel. I think they'd be sufficient if you were driving everywhere. Otherwise they are practical, comfortable and maintain their appearance."
3,Wrong size sent.,A size different from my order was sentand I ended up paying tge return postage. The boot looks nice but it runs small.
2,Not waterproof,"The boots fit well and are attractive but they are not waterproof. My feet do not get soaked, but in the front of the shoe (toe area) the boots allow water in and as a result, they leave my feet cold and damp. I now wear plastic bags over my socks to keep my feet dry when I wear these boots. Very disappointed."
4,Avant-Garde Art Explained,"This book, full of pictures, scripts, diagrams, and interviews, is an essential for any person studing the Avant-Garde movements of this century. It provides stories, opinions, and explinations from the people who created the movement itself, and also included inumerous examples of many different kinds of happenings. A facinating read for anyone interested in theatre or art."
2,Heavier/Bigger,"This was much bigger and heavier than expected; virtually no different than the regular ""NON-Flat"" folding umbrellas. I was expecting the small, light ones that were in the stores.I'm sure as an umbrella it's fine."
3,It's a good start,"I bought the Kindle version of this book for a class that I am taking as part of my masters degree. It has a lot of features that I like such as being able to search and add easy to find notes. The thing that I don't like about it is that the Kindle version does not have everything that the hard copy does. The Kindle version also doesn't have page numbers. When the professor references a certain page in an assignment, it makes it very difficult to know if I am referencing the right material. For the most part I like using a Kindle version but they need to do a better job to make sure that everything is included from the original version.As far as the actual content of the book is concerned, it is fairly informative. I think the author could do a better job explaining some topics. A lot of the phrasing could be reworded to make the book easier to read."
4,Old ideas but worthy insights,"I must admit I haven't read this book, but I recently attended a presentation by Bryan Lawson where he presented these ideas in some detail. He is a good, entertaining speaker and has shown very good writing skills in previous books.The topic, however, is mostly well-known stuff by designers and architects, who have been interested in how the built environment shapes our behaviour for millenia, literally. The classic studies by Jacobs (""Death and Life of Great American Cities"") is a more recent (1960s) example of this concern.In all (topic + author), I'd recommend this book to readers who are interested in design and architecture topics and are not fully familiar with Jacobs and all the subsequent work in envirmomental behaviour. This is a good place to do some catching-up.It is also very much recommended to non-design people trying to understand that design is much more than 'styling' or superficial appearance."
5,great product,"The product was a very good price and free shipment. The actual product was exacty what I was looking for, it was easy to install with good instructions and works great."
5,Came as described,"This item came exactly as described, charger and all.Amazon advertises many of these kits as having chargers, when in reality they aren't included.Check the manufacturer's websites for verification of kit contents.FYI: Most break away battery makers recommend that these batteries are charged at around .3 amps, which is the reason for the charger in these kits.The life of these batteries may be shortened if allowed to charge directly from vehicle, unregulated.A very small solar battery ""maintainer"" will work too. Check solar panel output amperage before using."
5,A Page Turner,"Joens has created a beautiful work of fiction that was refreshing to read. After growing weary of 'prarie' Christian novels, I was blessed to stumble onto this book.The Crimson Tapestry is about a boy called Worm with no past and an uncertain future. His world is turned upside down when he finds himself staying with a family that may have keys to unlock his past. Encountering an enormous bear, packs of wolves, and men who want his death, Worm's life is suddenly full of adventure, mystery, and romance as he makes the journey to discover who he really is.Fast-paced, with intense moments that made me hold my breath, this book is a must-read for anyone who likes the action/adventure genre. Although The Crimson Tapestry is set in 5th century Europe, it feels like fantasy. I strongly reccomend this book- but make sure you have plenty of time for it- it's difficult to put down!!"
4,"Great sound quality, but over-ear fit not as solid.","Great sound quality in the head set, but I wish I would have selected one of the over-the-head models instead. Once you put on the ""over-the-ear"" version, you can't just forget about it. Now I'm looking into replacing with the head band."
3,"butterscotch canary eats rainbow swamp gas, and how!","Confused with the name of this title? Then you'll probaby be even more confused with this movie. The movie makes almost no sense, but is funny none the less. It's full of skitsophrenic humor that can only be asociated with the asinine humor of the Naked Gun series. With action, random humor, and even musical numbers, how can you go wrong?! I give this title 3 out of 5 stars, and a kudos to Jackie Chan for gracing the foriegn film industry with this haphazard adventure of slapstick escapades. (oh yeah, to be fair, i borrowed the name of this review from an article that appeared in Game Informer magazine.)"
2,Oh Dear!,"I wasn't to sure of this movie, well, it has a couple of good fight scenes and a few slightly amusing moments but apart from that, it's pretty silly. I cant really say much else cos there is not much else to say!"
3,"This Movie is fun-filled, yet...","""Fantasy Mission Force"" is for all of you lovers of bad movies. It mixes fast-action with bad dialogue that has been poorly dubbed. It's a hoot to watch, but it still made me feel like I should watch better movies!"
1,Do not waste your time and money!,"The DVD was of a really poor quality. More like a badly scratched tape. The dialogues inaudible.About the movie, the less said the better.Jackie is there for only a few scenes.The whole movie is filled with insane happenings which one has no hope of understanding.Best avoided"
1,Don't Watch This,Please don't watch this.Jackie is at his weakest in this one.I really hated this.....Please don't watch it.Jackie doesn't do anything impressive for his fans in this one.I won't even try to really review this because it's not worth my time or yours.
4,Great Trash,"Pauline Kael once said that movies are so rarely art, that if you can't enjoy great trash, there is not much point for one to go to the movies. Well, this demented film is trash of the greatest order, a movie so bad it's wonderful. It stars Hong Kong luminaries Jackie Chan (in a small role, despite its prominent billing role) and Brigitte Lin, and unlike Ed Wood movies, this film is deliberately bad, but that doesn't make it any less entertaining."
2,Jackie is not playing a good part but his kung-fu is okay.,"Jakie is a action hero with great skills but doesn't fight alot untill the last 20 min. or so , good to watch but not buy, try to borrow or rent it at your local video store."
1,Why Jackie?,This is a Jackie Chan film? You could have fooled me. I've seen the movie twice and still have no idea what it's about. With very little action and no story this is definately one you can live without. Also horrible picture quality. Oh well Jackie has plenty of other films worth watching.
1,What a piece of %$#@! Has almost NO Jackie Chan.,"Last June I had an operation and I was on morphine for several days. This movie could have been a weird dreams I had. It certainly isn't entertaining, intelligent, functional, or anything. It makes no sense, has no humor, has very little action, has no point and goes downhill from worthless. A few minutes into the movie, it turns into something else and has no explanation how it got there.It reminds me of some of the stories I have heard of movie albums that were required under a contract even though the singer/band was fed up with the company. They come up with the absolute worst album they could come up with. This movie could fit into that category. It is painful to watch even a few minutes.For the person who put this in the same category as Naked Gun, I disagree."
1,Disappointment for Jackie Chan Fans,"Thsi movie is a complete waste of time and money for Jackie Chan fans.His screen presence is only a few minutes, in 2-3 scenes.The story is obscure.Editing is poor. One cannot understand what is going on!Sound is poor with poor quality dubbing as well. picture quality is also worse than an old VHS tape.it is a complete waste."
5,Review of Texas Books,"Gives sound advice for consumer protection, and the appendix has helpful phone numbers. This book should prove helpful for those dreaming of marrying in a new and exotic place"
5,Booklist,"Not just wedding but also honeymoon locations are presented in this all-encompassing, attractively formated directory"
5,works fine on Win XP,"On three different computers with Windows XP the drive works great.Even on my one computer with Windows 98se it was okay. Sometimes I like to leave the drive plugged in during boot up, and Win 98se had difficulties with that. So I'd have to give four stars while operating under Windows 98se."
4,good present,I made this for a friend who loves humming birds and she loved it. it was easy for me to make.
4,Usage,I found that the controller was very useful and had the features that I need. It will be a primary control and works very well with other units. Right now I asm working a DC system but ma6y upgrade at some point. The dilas and controls are easy to use and the size is perfect for the space available.
4,Decent set,I picked up one set of these and the Red ones and they are bright and of decent quality. Good value considering the price.
2,"What it does, it does well. However, it falls way short.","This book is good in how it presents the information it does. However, it falls way short of teaching enough. It is a basic book at best. If you are just starting out in CBT, then this book is for you. If you have done any CBT before, then don't bother. And if you are experienced with Authorware and want more on ODBC, CMI, or KO's....keep looking."
3,They changed the name but didn't update the book.,"Although this book says it is about Authorware 5, it is essentially a reprint of the Authorware 4 Authorized book with all traces of Macintosh removed. The book is reasonably good on the basics, but none of the Authorware 5 only features are covered."
1,Authorware 5 Attain Authorized (2nd Edition),"This is the worst book in the world! If you want to learn Authorware, it is impossible to understand what it says."
2,Macromedia blew it with this one.,One of the most powerful things in this product(knowledge objects) they don't even discuss. Their excuse is to learn directly with Authorware and then they tell you to how to click an option box to prevent it from showing up again!?! Go figure? They should put out a Authorware 2 and do a better job.
1,Don't waste your money,"once again, Macromedia produces a great product with bad documentation. This ""Authorized"" version of the manual is not even as good as the help files that come with Authorware. Spend your money somewhere else."
1,Not up to date,"There have been so many changes in authorware that this book, while handy for it's time, is not a valid resource anymore. IT really lacks because of this, missing on some of the finer points of the newer authorware systems and abilities. Most of the high points of this book are moot now, expecially with the advent of Flash integration, the expanded Calculator Icon, and the higher movie integration."
2,An introduction for beginners,"The book walks a reader through the basics, but doesn't do enough to allow for serious work. There is no treatment of functions and Knowledge Objects are avoided. The CD also does not include the Web Player so you have to go off and download it."
3,too wordy but the message is there,"This book was too wordy and needed editing, but I appreciated the message that forgiveness starts and ends with yourself. It was my first time reading about forgiveness and I was surprised to find that none of the 12 steps had much to do with the other person who hurt you. It encouraged me to start working on accepting myself and for that, I'm grateful."
2,kind of a let down,it kind of worked for what I needed it for. it took a while to get set up and it did work but not as well as expected
1,Do not purchase,I bought this product and the installation CD had a virus on it that wiped out my whole hard drive. I will never buy from this company again.
2,"They must to say ""Bluetooth STEREO PC Adapter""","I just wanted a Bluetooth PC Adapter for comunicate my mini Laptop with my printer HP, nothing more. But when the product arrived to my hands i can see that it wasn't what i needed it.SÃ³lo querÃ­a un adaptor de Bluetooth para computadora para comunicar mi mini laptop con mi impresora, mÃ¡s nada. Pero cuando me llegÃ³ el producto vÃ­ que no era lo que necesitaba, es un adaptador para audifonos y celulares motorola."
3,Some old favorites,"These selections cover her English language recordings made after she came to America, with some old favorites represented. Maybe this should have been a two-disc album, to include her earlier work in German."
3,Might work on your dog,"Unfortunately this didn't work to well for my dog, but like any personal hygiene product it all depends on the user. It may work well for another dog. I really can't give this a bad review."
3,"Good product, bad price.","I've had a totally different experience than what the guy above stated. I have had this webcam for a little over 2 years now and have traveled to India and South Korea with it. It has lasted through thick and thin and never stopped functioning. The picture used to come in a little fuzzy when I first bought it, but now that MSN messenger upgraded their program, I have a very clear picture. As good as a CMOS lens gets anyways. The big problem with this is that the technology is out of date and you can probably get the same or better for cheaper or about the same price. If you love Sonys, get this one. I admit I'm a sucker for Sony, but if you want the best deal, search around some more. Good product, but overpriced. (This was posted when the webcam was being sold at $90)."
3,Good but not for long,"The quality was excellent ""while it worked"". It got sick and no picture. Forget about dealing with Sony Customer Serv. If it last for you enjoy it. It is bound to dye at least for me."
5,This DVD flies high.,"""Superman:The Movie"" is a tremendously magical fantasy that delivers the imagination in those who really believe a man can fly.23 years after its release,the acting,story,cast and special effects hasn't lost its touch.The restoration of this film is the most pleasing I have seen and it's a thrill to watch the film in its original widescreen format.Christopher Reeve is a delight to watch.I love the screen tests and the theatrical trailer."
4,This is a good movie,I think you should watch it. Lois Lane is kind of irritating and Christopher Reeve way overdoes the dorky Clark Kent but its still pretty good.
5,Superman breaks the time barrier!,"From the comic book stands of the pre-war 1930s and 40s, to the big screen of the post-watergate 1970s, the Man of Steel does it again. Superman sours over the City of Metropolis and defeats the evil plans of Lex Luthor. And along the way captures the heart of America all over again in this cinematic display of special effects, action, and an excellent performace by Christopher Reeve. To the young who haven't seen this movie-see it. Those those of us who saw at the theater-see it again, and watch the Last Son of Krypton be, not just a hero, but what he said he was in the Movie...""A Friend"""
3,"Superman, the movie, blu-ray...Oops!","Oops! Amazon.com; something went wrong. I know I will love seeing this original Christopher Reeve movie again, but this is the first time for me that you've goofed. Blu-ray was not what I ordered; I've sent it back, hoping that regular DVD format will be re-sent to me. Thanks for listening, Amazon.com. Sincerely and respectfully, Adisa Achaki."
2,"Okay, but where's Luthor?","It boggles my mind how anyone could bring the classic character to the big screen and not bring Superman's most dastardly nemesis with him. I'm speaking of course about Lex Luthor. There are some who believe that Gene Hackman's character (who is never mentioned by name in the movie, believe it or not) is supposed to be Luthor, but we really have no way of knowing. Boo to Warner Bros and all involved, except the actors."
3,"Not bad, but lacks personality and makes a few mistakes","Superman is great in this version (they tried to get him to act just like Christopher Reeves, and did a good job), but Ms. Lane is horrible. She is very beautiful, but lacks the personality of the Lane from the originals.Everything about the story is solid and fun, except for the little love triangle between Superman, Lane, and her live-in boyfriend(?!) Her son was obvious from the start, but it was fun.Besides the lack of personality in Ms. Lane, and the lame love-triangle, the show was very good. I recommend at least watching it to see Superman back in action."
1,Laughable effects & plot,"Although the effects were state of the art for their time, they haven't aged well at all. Not bad for its time, but nothing compared to today's superior technology. The fact that the plot looked like it was written on swiss cheese doesn't help either."
1,Blu-ray Does not work,As yet I have been unable to view this Film as it's not for UK but only for the USA. I am disapointed that this was not pointed out to me before I purchased them.
5,Great acting makes this movie fly.,"The special effects of this movie look somewhat dated. But it does not matter. Everytime I watch this movie I appreciate it more, mainly because of the acting. Everyone is just fantastic, especially Reeve. His Clark Kent/Superman performance is one of the best performances I've ever seen. Hackman is also in prime form.And after watching this movie over the years with its washed-out colors and grainy look, the dvd picture, by contrast, looks FANTASTIC.The other features on the dvd are just ok, but they do provide some interesting inside information."
5,EXCELLENT (Coming From Someone Who Hates Comic Book Movies),"Just finished watching the disc, including ALL of its features. The disc has 2 sides(which, by the way, are very hard to distinguish from one another as the disc has no label-one must be nearsighted to read what the lettering on the disc says) & includes the film (with added & mostly unseen footage), the directors commentary (with director Richard Donner & writer Tom Mankewicz-did I spell that right?), 3 very interesting documentaries about the making of the film, trailers, & the soundtrack.I for one do not read comic books & do not generally enjoy comic book movies but SUPERMAN I & II are among my favorite films becuase, unlike X-MEN or BATMAN, they were poignant & had heart. I recommend buying copies of I & II since they were so excellent but not III or IV which were so very AWFUL (by the way, how unusual is it for I & II, among the best films ever made, to be followed up by III & IV, among the worst films ever made?)!"
3,"Extended version only, no theatrical cut","I can't review this disc technically, as I don't have a good enough home theater to take advantage of a Blu-Ray's picture or sound quality. But you should know that the Blu-Ray only has the extended cut, not the original theatrical release. If you prefer the 1978 version, you're better off hanging onto your four-disc DVD set with more extras, AND both versions of the movie."
3,Still Good After All These Years.,"I still remember as a kid when this came out the year after Star Wars redefined what going to the movies was. The expectations were so high, and yes this Superman delivered. We believed that a man could fly!More than a quarter of a century has passed and the movie does not stand the test of time very well, specially the special effects, what then blew our minds looks pedestrian at best today. The plot does have a lot of holes and it is unbelievable, but if we watch thru the eyes of a child this movie is still what was born to be, the best Superman to date and great fun."
3,Still some scenes missing? Why?,"Back in the early 80's, my parents taped this movie for us kids off of TV, I somehow still have it complete with goofy 80's commercials. It seems that this old tv tape is the only way to see some good scenes that get skipped over in all ""superman"" video/dvd releases.When Jimmy gets caught by superman at the dam, he pauses to let Jimmy take a picture of the dam breaking saying, ""go ahead, shoot"".A bunch of houses start grinding together with people jumping out of windows, and running around. There is also an after scene when the people return once it stops.You get to see the hollywood sign go back up on its own.After superman leaves lois and jimmy at the red car, it cuts to Lex Luthor playing the piano singing ""you must have been a beautiful baby..."", with Miss Stepmacker dangling above a lion's den. When he drops her, superman catches her, then takes Lex and Otis to jail.Guess I just want the movie version I grew up with."
5,LOOK UP IN THE SKY!,"Colorful, exhilirating, and magical, Christopher Reeve's ""Superman"" is a worthy translation of the first super-hero's never-ending crusade for ""truth, justice, and the American way"" to the big screen. My Dad took me to see this when it first came out in the 70s, and the years haven't dimmed this gem one bit. Reeve, of course, is perfectly cast as the orphan from the stars who will become Earth's greatest hero. Margot Kidder is a wonderful Lois Lane, and Gene Hackman has a ball as criminal mastermind Lex Luthor. Marlon Brano's Jor-El lends a powerful authority to the opening scenes on doomed Krypton, and his lingering presence haunts the rest of the movie much as his spirit does Kal-El. Funny, touching, and suspenseful in exactly the right touches (well, Lois Lane's mid-flight poety recital might be a bit much), ""Superman: The Movie"" is for everyone who was ever a kid, and every boy who ever wanted to fly like Superman."
3,Too many added scenes,"I grew up with this movie. I loved it and had to have it in my collection simply for reasons of nostalgia. However, I was disappointed with the extended length of it. The added scenes are interesting, but I wish they would have put them in a ""Deleted Scenes"" category instead of making you watch a 3 hour flick."
4,A+ for effort,"This is a classic as I remembered watching it throughout my life. To now watching it in high definition, I couldn't believe I was watching the same movie. There were a few scenes that couldn't or didn't get the restore treatment, but in general, the whole film was restored."
4,Theatrical Cut Please,"The original Superman:The Movie I give 5 Stars: without a doubt a monumental movie. This version, while technically great, cuts in too many (wisely cut in the first place) extra scenes and extended versions of existing scenes placing a drag on the pacing. The original theatrical cut is considered by Richard Donner to be his 'director's cut': this version is more of a curiosity piece. Film students could watch it to learn something about film editing and pacing. I saw the original movie at least 15 - 20 time during it's theatrical release and feel Warner's has almost ruined the film with this presentation. Let's hope Warner's releases the theatrical cut on the upcoming (fall 2006) Ultimate Superman collection. One thing I will say I did like was the audio remix for Dolby 5.1. Although I'm a purist concerning this film, they did a great job remixing the dialogue, sound effects and music."
2,Illogical plot spoils Superman The Movie.,"I remember going to see this movie in 1978.You could feel the anticipation and excitement in the audience just before the first flying scene.You can believe a man can fly,but can you believe the illogical plot?Lex Luther(Gene Hackman)is going to create new beachfront property by separating California from the rest of the USA with nuclear weapons and Superman reverses time by reversing the rotation of the Earth(come again??).This movie has superb production values and good performances,but is let down by a ridiculous and campy plot and villian.If it had stuck to a serious plot,like Star Wars,it would have done much better.An over-rated film."
3,restore the sequals,warner bros IAM overjoyed how you restored SUPERMAN BUT why did you didn't do anyhting to the other 3 movies. I have a sugesion why don't you put A ULTIMITE EDTION BOX CONTAINING ALL FOUR FILMS FULLY REMASTERED AND RESTORED WITH A NEW HIGH DEFINTION TRANSFER. Plus a bouns 5th disk containing interviews with cast members from all 4 films plus alot more.I have a idea on what the case for the set should be . The box would be made like the superman logo and made as a tin
4,It set the Standard,"Now that comic book films are part of Hollywood, it is helpful to re-examine one of the first and the best. Richard Donner's direction of this film is excellent, as is the acting by the cast. The wonderful midwestern landscapes of this film are still as beautiful now as they were then (I think they were shot in Canada, if memory serves correctly), and are in my view WAY underrated. It took twelve years (Dances With Wolves) before the plains were shot this way again.I also remember the big hub-bub about Marlon Brando's salary for this film...Brando's performance is very good and just reinforces why he is one of the all time greats.Many people remember Star Wars. This is the film that I remember from that time. Truly a classic."
3,What Happened?,Blu Ray quality is good but the movie went from great while on Krypton to stupid. I remember liking it as a kid but once Clark Kent got to earth it turned cheesy and slap stick and Superman turned out to be an undisciplined idiot who is prone to self pity. Lame hero.
3,Special edition is not worth the money,"Although Superman the Movie is worth watching, I feel I paid too much for this 'Special' edition. The other discs are not worth paying the extra $15 or more dollars - you can purchase the four movie collection for less than 1/2 the price of this edition."
4,The force of the myth!,"The most famous cartoon of the past Century, that during several decades nourished the popular imagination - based on mythical roots - acquired a new breadth with the formal entrance to the big screen, after being exhibited on TV series.A world on the eve of extinction - Krypton - sends to the Earth (a primitive planet) the seminal seed of Jor- El (Marlon Brando in a mesmerizing although very brief role) named Kal-El. Along this journey his father prepared all his enormous knowledge to instruct him about the future that waits for him in his new home.But as you know the evilness never rests; the perverse mind of Lex Luthor will appear in our planet and the new extragalactic hero will have to face him in order to preserve the peace and order.As you know the force of myth is an inextinguishable flame!"
4,"It's SUPER, man","Rather than a critique of the movie, which is fairly entertaining, but has some flaws, this review is based mostly on the quality of the DVD. Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman, Marlon Brando, and Ned Beatty are enjoyable in this film, and worth watching.Surprisingly clean, the careful transfer of this 23 year-old film to DVD is a lovely sight. The Dolby 5.1 audio track sings, and the music of John Williams, featured by itself on one of the audio tracks, is as powerful as the main character.There are plenty of additional features to enjoy, including screen tests, special effects tests, and an enjoyable commentary throughout by director Richard Donner.The movie has some shortcomings- Margot Kidder was roundly criticized for playing Lois Lane, as one reviewer wrote in 1978, ""like a reformed hooker."" But this movie has become an icon, and this DVD provides a clear (almost X-ray vision) look at an American classic."
4,Great classic reborn,"The Man of Steel is reborn in this blu-ray version of the classic Superman - The Movie. The film was extremely clean and clear, the effects were phenominal, and the sound track is amazing! I recommend this to anyone who is a Superman fan! My only grip with the film was during the explosion of the sun of Krypton; you actually see the room in which the fake sun exploded. At normal play speed you see the black curtain behind the sun as well as the shadow from the roof and walls. I guess you really can see everything in High Definition!Over all excellent movie in high Def."
2,Blu-ray Makes A Huge Mistake,"The blu-ray version of ""Superman: The Movie"" leaves out one of the most important features of the DVD version: the original stereo sound mix. In order to make a 5.1 mix for the DVD release, the studio had to re-create the sound effects for the entire movie. Unfortunately, they did a terrible job. Everything sounds over done, like in the THX/The Audience Is Listening short. Imagine if they ""re did"" the sound effects for Star Wars? That would be stupid right? At least give us the option to have a stereo mix."
5,The gold standard in digital reproduction,"This is by far the best digital reproduction in my collection. Accompanying the anamorphic video, the 5.1 audio track is perhaps better than the experience of the theaters of the late 70's when the film originally aired. Hopefully, like Roger Bannister did for running in breaking the four minute mile barrier, others will shortly follow suit with similar excellent reproductions of more classics. The ""bar"" has now been set..."
5,best movie ever,i felt that the writing and acting were fantastic gene hackman is a perfect lex luthor and christopher reves is the best superman ever. excellent special effects for its time. my all time favorite movie
5,great! Christopher Reeve was born to be Superman.,It was spectacular! I THOUGHT THIS WOULD STINK BUT I WAS SO WRONG. Great for anyone who loves a good time.
2,Could have been good... but not.,"There are many problems with this movie keeping me from liking it. One, the opening with young Clark just drags on for far too long. I could deal with that, though. The thing that kills the movie for me (spoiler alert, assuming you've been on a deserted island for the last 25 years) is the end. Not only do I think every show/movie that uses time travel to undo some tragedy is a cop out, it was also performed in the most unbelievable way possible. The world is not a big tape!! You can't rewind it! Even as a kid when I first saw this, I realized that spinning the earth backwards would not reverse time. (It would cause some good ol' fashioned world wide devastation that would have made Luthor's scheme look like nothing in comparison.) Also, if he can fly that fast, why couldn't he catch the missles in the first place?"
2,"Stay away, Very Corny!!!","I saw this movie on TV a few days ago. OH MY GOD! it was good until clark met Lois Lane. Then it got REALLY bad. the special effects were pretty cheesy, then again it WAS 1978 so ill forgive them for that. I heard theyre making a new superman movie . It better be good! not like this piece of crap. Im glad i saw it on TV didnt have to wast money on a rental or this DVD. I love the superman comic books though. I recommend the death of superman arc. Great book!"
3,so so,"Not a huge fan of this transfer, blu ray really exposes the problems with picture quality in a 1978 film release. all in all it's never looked better,defects and all.the extended and new scenes are cool the special features are ok but nothing you haven't seen before (in previous dvd releases of this) the movie is a blast of course. Hands down the best Superman movie ever made and on my top 5 greatest superhero movies ever. Shipping was fast and the item arrived in perfect condition. Good job Amazon!"
4,Superman - The Movie,"Valerie Perrine as Eve Teschmacher and Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor are the interesting couple. Christopher Reeve fell from a horse and spent his last years paralyzed. I saw irony in the myth and perhaps a curse on the character. Others noted Reeve's heroism. A quote from Hackman stayed with me, ""Some people can read War and Peace and come away thinking it's a simple adventure story. Others can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and unlock the secrets of the universe."""
5,"THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER, BY FAR",THE SUPERMAN MOVIE IS GREAT.NEVER HAVE I SEEN BETTER.SUPERMAN2 IS JUST AS GOOD. WHOEVER THINKS THIS MOVIE IS BAD IS STUPID.I LOVED IT.trust me if you get it you will love it too.
4,Like Movies Wide Screen And Full Screen For Your T.V. Screen,It's A Bird! It's A Plane! No It's Superman To The Rescue. Flys Over The City's Loves His Parent's And Loves His Job At Work. And He Pretectcs The World From Falling Apart. And He Is The Awsome Man Of Steal On The Face Of The Earth.That's Why They Call Him Superman.
4,Superman The Movie-Christopher Reeve-The Real Deal.,"The Original Superman while probably looking dated thanks to all the CGI/Special effects of now is still an enjoyable treat,You have Christopher Reeve(RIP-Best Superman,only one I know.)and The Beautiful but ever annoying and selfish Lois Lane,Despite not being a DC guy myself(if I am,I always prefered Batman.)I enjoyed the movie,Hackman makes a crummy villain however,but his woman who returns again in the next of many installments is beautiful,Why Ned Beatty(Deliverance) I am not sure,other than few of my pet peeves with the movie I mostly enjoyed and would watch again but not buy."
4,HIGH ADVENTURE!!!,"Absorbing chronicle of a guy from out of town who learns he can fly. Things get kinky when he develops a taste for tights. The effects are dated, but the tights hold up, even today."
2,Worst blu-ray conversion I have seen to date,I bought this film expecting to see the normal sharpness of the Blu-Ray format but didn't get it. In fact it was like watching a bad transfer on DVD instead. Sound quality was also mediocre as well. You are going to be disappointed if you buy this as my wife and I were. A very disappointed buyer!
3,THE MAN OF STEEL,An incredible film of epic proportions Richard Donner makes a stand for good old fashionioned beginning middle and end As opposed to flashback he tells the story from start to finish The helicopter scene from start to end is the greatest piece of superhero motion ever recorded The way the music builds up the clever use of crowds and cutting and the excitment of catching lois only to have a helicopter fall towards them ] Genius Genius Genius The whole movie is worth watching for that sequence alone
2,"Save Your Money! Get ""Superman: The Movie (2000) instead.","I agree with the prior reviewers (Wayne C. Rogers, ""bass boy"" music fan), that this totally un-necessary four disc special edition, is nothing more than a pricy repackaging of the Dual-disc 2000 DVD release of ""Superman: The Movie"", with a few added bonus features, like the 78 Theatrical release of the film, and the old serials, meant to coincide with the Superman-Mania greeting the video release of ""Superman Returns."""
3,Not like the Original movie,"I saw Superman the movie when it first came out. I was a kid then and I thought this was the best movie ever. It bought back some memories. However when I saw this video there was a scene that was not in the original movie that spoiled it for me. they should have made that a deleted scene. however the deleted scenes that were there as a special feature should have been included in the movie because it was part of the Original movie that I remember and that upset me even more. who ever put this DVD together messed this up, but it's still good to watch(Just skip over the part where superman and Jor'el gets emotional).It's NOT! that good of a special edition."
3,Added scenes on DVD make the beginning boring for kids.,"I fondly remember this movie and looked forward to watch itwith my 7 year old. Unfortunately, the added scenes on Krptondrag the movie out waaayy too long(154 minutes!). Maybe thesuperman purists find this incredibly interesting, but for kids it's a drag. Superman doesn't even appear flying in his uniformuntil about 50 minutes into the movie! This movie could be awesome for kids if it was cut down to about 1 hr 50 min., asthe caped crusader provides an awesome role model for kids (never lies, fights for justice, and respects his parents! haha). Anyways, it's still a classic worth seeing, just skipthe first 30 minutes until the part where the baby/toddler of steel is in space and about to reach earth. (-:"
4,Great for a Superman and HD fan!,"Obviously this movie wasn't filmed in high definition since that technology didn't exist when it was made. However, it does provide better clarity. If you don't own the movie, buy it in one format or the other. It's a definite classic and the best of the series. If you're an early adopter, buy the HD-DVD version to be prepared for the future. In my opinion, the HD-DVD format will win the format battle between HD-DVD and Blu-Ray."
5,SUPERMAN....OOOO HOW I MISS THE 80'S,"THIS MOVIE WAS MADE FOR CHRIS. HE ACTS IT LIKE HE WAS REALLY SUPERMAN. THE PART THAT MADE ME REWIND OVER AND OVER AGAIN WAS THE PART WHEN , HE WENT INTO THE PHONE BOOTH AND SPUN AROUND SOOO FAST AND CAME OUT TO SAVE HER...AND THE PART IN THE ALLEY WHEN HE RAN AS HE WAS CHANGING INTO SUPERMAN...GREAT EFFECTS...I WISH I WAS STILL IN THE 80'S ..THOUGH I WAS VERY YOUNG BUT SUPERMAN 1 AND 2 WILL ALWAYS BE A MOVIE U CAN SEE ANYTIME THEY PLAY IT ON TV. GOD BE WITH CHRIS AND I PREY THAT HE WALKS AGAIN BECAUSE ITS SAD TO SEE SUCH A SAD THING HAPPEN TO A GREAT HUMAN BEING . THANKS 4 ALL THE MEMORIES CHRIS."
5,The best Christopher Reeves has ever done!,A marvelous adaptation of the comic book superhero. A legacy movie to last forever. END
5,Better than it was in 1978,"When I saw this movie for the first time a few days before Christmas in 1978, I was hooked. I was 14 years old. Now in 2003, this movie is even better on DVD. Although, I would prefer the director's cut I'm very happy with this edition.We all know the story-I don't think it's neccescary going into details of the film. The added scenes are a plus. I think the little girl on the train(who turns out to be little Lois Lane)is a very significant scene. She sees superman run home from school and tries to tell her parents what she saw. A short but important scene-because it adds more drama to the romance later in the film.I have a message for Warner Brothers: Put out the director's cut. I don't care how long the film is. I think that you should take full advantage of the capablties of the DVD format.The 3 documentries provide a lot of insights on how the film was made."
3,Not What I was Looking For!,"This DVD/Blu-Ray is an extended version of the original movie. Much better. However, it was not the version I was looking for. They added about 8 additional minutes to this version. I actually have a longer version on VHS that I taped off of TV decades ago. I was hoping this DVD was the same version, but it is not, so this version was a little disappointing. But, since most of you guys haven't seen the version I have, you will probably like this version. So, buy it. FYI for example, the version I have on VHS has a seen at the end where Superman has to save Eve Teschmacher from Lex Luther. He was going to feed him to his Alligators, which you would have seen in another scene in the movie. There was one scene that was not in the version I have with Marlon Brando."
5,Good quality,Great movie with good DVD quality. Two extra discs contain some special features that are worth to see for a superman fan!
3,Still no edition that Donner would approve,"The Blu-ray edition gives you the ""Extended Version"" edit, without telling you anywhere in the packaging that this is not the original release edit. The added scene where Superman tries to give Marlon Brando's ghost a hug is unintentially hilarious. There's a reason Donner cut it, and the decision to restore it is poor. We already have to deal with the Margot Kidder voiceover during the romantic flying sequence...we don't need to add more groaners to this movie. Donner's already stated he prefers the release version...why can't they give us a good release of that?"
5,A Classic,"Despite what we'd now see as mediocre special effects, the sheer power of this film is undeniable. The first time Christopher Reeve appears as Superman, one can't help but flush with nostalgia for this ideal of superhero lore. From a time when truth, justice, and ""the American way"" seemed much clearer and cleaner. A true classic for all generations."
4,"""You'll Believe a Man Can Fly""","The first (and best) of the big-budget Christopher Reeve adventures, with the expanded 151-minute version a slight improvement over the 1978 theatrical cut. Winning performances, Richard Donner's affectionate direction and John Williams' score easily surpass the uneven special effects. A comic-book epic done right."
5,One of (if not the best) restoration I've seen to date!,"The quality of the picture and sound will blow you away. It looks like it was filmed yesterday. I have no idea how they pulled this off, but the result makes you feel like you're watching it for the first time.My 5 star rating is not for the movie it's self but for the quality of this DVD based on it's price and features. Superman the movie is a classic, but not my favorite in the series. Had I been judging for the film alone, I would have given it 3 stars. Chances are if you're buying it you've seen this before. The restoration work is beautiful, the bonus material is great, the added material is somewhat frustrating at times. It's obvious why they cut many of these scenes."
4,"It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a great movie...","Great movie and terrific introduction to the big screen for the Man of Steel. One of the great scenes in movie history is the rescue of Lois Lane, dangling from a helicopter. Way to go, Superman! The film has great effects, fantastic music, and a good plot. The characterizations and dialogue are SUPERb. The only annoying aspect of the movie is the prolonged comedic sequences re: Lex Luthor and his henchpeople. This prevents it from getting 5 stars. Otherwise, the movie is a classic, and the selection of Chris Reeve as the Man of Steel is perfect."
2,Great movie but horrible image quality!,"I wtrote this review several months ago but somehow it got dropped off. Superman The Movie is a great movie, one of my favorites, that deserves to be restored digitally in widescreen format. But this version is horribly disappointing! I bought the most expensive VHS I could find online, which was this clamshell version, to try to get widescreen (this was before you could get full descriptions). I left it in shrinkwrap until I was ready to see it again. What a disappointment! The video quality of this copy was washed out and has so many dust spots, scratches, and other flaws that it looks as though someone went to a second run theater and just videoed a tired old screening. I have a high-quality VCR & TV on which other VHS tapes look awesome. Wait for a remastered version!"
5,fantastic,it such a great pleasure to watch a classic movie i watch as a kid on special dvd it includes some classic cartoon of 40s and the superman vs molemen movie which was cool but i didnt buy it here i got it at a 99 cent store brand new for 6.99 what a bargain enjoy everyone
4,WWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!,Even though there wern't many canges this completly changed the way I even LOOK at Superman. The changes are so much for sombody who has looked at Superman in one specific way all there life.
5,Still the BEST!!!,"This film is not only the best film adaptation of a comic book hero, it is one of the best films of the 1970s. Director Richard Donner made an epic film that is romantic, exciting, and just plain fun. The humanity that Chris Reeve brought to Superman/Clark Kent is what makes the film work. The DVD is wonderful. The behind the scenes stories are interesting. The best part is the screen tests. How fun to watch a very young and skinny Chris Reeve audition with not only Margot Kidder, but also Stockard Channing, Anne Archer, Leslie Anne Warren and others. The deleted scenes are good too. Buy it and enjoy it!"
3,Needs More Work!! A Shame,"I just watched an advance copy of this long awaited WB classic. The anamorphic image is not stellar. The negative must be damaged. There were some nics/scratchs in several scenes. I wish they used some software to clean up the problems (ala Criterion Collection). The sound was good, B+. Some of the split surround effects were a tad over used. Example: When Lex Luther breaks the glass map of the world, is it necessary to hear the shards falling behind me when the action is in front??? I wish the DVD contained the original audio mix. The commentary with Richard Donner was very interesting. He went into a lot of detail about specific scenes and the difficulties he had with the producers. The 5.1 music-only wasn't so hot (pity). The recording is a bit dated. The bass is weak. I was looking forward to this DVD and I'm a little disappointed. They should do some more work on this beofre the big release."
5,"The BEST film based on a comic strip, EVER!!!!!!!!","Now THIS is a great movie! I watch it every chance I get! It hassomething for everyone!I think SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE goes right to the top of my list forbest action/adventure/comedy/romance/family film I've ever seen!Of course, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA is the best but SUPERMAN:THEMOVIE comes in an awfully close second!There is a brief scene where it shows baby superman nude. butthat's only on the VHS! The DVD doesn't show that, thankfully.I recommend it to all families!"
5,A great value for good dance music,"These are very danceable tracks at a really good price. I have no idea why ""Skirl of the pipes"" is on this ballroom dance album, but there are still 19 well performed and cleanly recorded dance tracks. Tracks 11 and 14 are at Viennese waltz tempos (about 60 measures per minute)."
2,Ten Tenors in Prayer,"This CD did not feature the Ten Tenors as I expected it to. It featured great tenors of our time, but was not what I wanted."
3,"a surprizingly good first effort, needs some growth","this first effort by the Howard Stern punching bag graduate is pretty solid. His voice is not bad, but not often memorable, but he does modify it with interest, especially on ""Pretty Girl"", where his voice gives the song its hook. The insturment work is competent and borderline alternative. But, it sounds ""high school bandish"" at times, though a very good high school band. If this cd is a success, i expect more refinement in the future."
1,Stutteringly Stupid,This was a half cracked attempt at cashing in on his self depricating celebrity. Mel Tillis is still the king of stuttering musicians!
5,Costs less than a few massages...with greater impact,"I have had back problems for years. I go to a massage therapist almost every other week costing me $250 a month. Although I will continue with the messages, this is a great investment. It was relatively easy to assemble, although the instructions could be a bit better. The machine is solid. I never feel concerned about its stability and the movement is smooth. I have spent thousands of dollars on massage chairs, back stretchers, lumbar support, etc. And I am convinced that this contraption, which was the least I have spent on an item, will have the greatest impact. In fact, I already feel an inch taller (key word is ""feel""). I just wish it were a bit more compact or easier to store. My place is a small condo with limited space. But that's a minor point."
3,expected more,"This album has it's moment but there just to few, I really expected more from these legends of of music"
3,A good book but...,"The more sexually explicit material was deleted from the text when the book was first published. In this edition the material has been added back in, but apparently no one thought it necessary to then do any further editing, which results in some startling juxtapositions and unintended sloppiness."
3,"Point, please","I'm a great admirer of Ackerley's writing, and this book is beautifully written, but I failed to get the point. That could be my fault, but since in his other writing he made his points forcefully I suspect that maybe there isn't one to Hindoo Holiday."
4,Dashboards of exotic Autos,An unusual way to talk about sports cars of another age. Interesting and contains stuff not found elsewhere. Also shows what drivers had to work with on these early racers.
1,A big disappointment,"In my library of screenwriting books, this was unfortunately the least helpful. If you're a beginning screenwriter, read Robert McKee, Linda Seger, Christopher Vogler, and Syd Field. Then don't waste anymore time reading books on screenwriting. Just sit down and do it. When you've got a completed draft, read Lerch's ""500 Ways"" and Flinn's ""How NOT to Write a Screenplay"", before you actually submit the script anywhere. Good luck."
5,Get Kindle: too many people steal this book,"This book separates the trees from the forest and puts you back in the forest again. I love it. I got pc kindle; so I wouldn't lose it again -- had three for sure.UCLA Screenwriting guru with CONCEPT explanation. Concept beats cookie cutter. You will be inspired and given two things: freedom and direction. His tricks of the trade generate invention. If you are an artist type, this book is for you. If you are recipe you will follow to cook a screenplay, not so much. Then again, you're never going to be a chef until you get the concept."
2,Buy 'Story' instead.,"I bought this book expecting an epiphany.Instead I got Hunter's second rate screenplay, which makes up a fair proportion of its pages. I felt a bit cheated, especially considering the high regard in which it is held.Maybe his class is good, but this book bears no comparison to Robert McKee's."
2,Screenwriting 434 may be a great class. Book is creepy.,"Reading excerpts from the author's screenplay about child pornography FALLEN ANGEL, and his *entire* screenplay THE GLASS HAMMER makes me want to jump into the shower.My opinon? An exercise in how to spend time with a well-crafted story I didn't care for and characters I didn't like. My appreciation of professional readers increases every day!The technical instruction? Helpful, but not enough to justify this vanity publication. Others have tackled teaching the craft of screenwriting more thoroughly and with greater success. For my money: Aristotle, Ejri, McKee, Vogler."
4,easier said than done,"This is as good a book as there is of the dozens on screenwriting. It won't write your script for you, but will certainly help look at complted work in a constructvive way."
3,Average resource with practical information,"For starters, most people I know recommend ""Screenplay"" by Syd Field.OK, so maybe Lew Hunter's book is not the end all and be all of screenwriting books, but for the beginner there is some helpful information here.Hunter's book offers a beginner's primer on the do's and dont's of screenplay writing. He presents the typical Hollywood formula, 3-act structure, length, and style. If a screenplay writer doesn't keep his or her screenplay to the expected formula and technical standards it will never even get read.Hunter also provides a screenplay of his own complete with commentary so that readers can follow along with him. It's not a good screenplay, mind you, but it is helpful.I'm not saying this book is the best screenwriting book on the market, but it did offer helpful information to someone who knows absolutely nothing about writing screenplays."
3,Decent book; shows screenwriting from a conventional angle,"Book is OK. Sometimes formulaic and pedantic. As always, there is no substitute for actually putting pen to paper(Hunter also says that!).Breaks up a script into three acts: Setup situation, introduce complications, and come to conclusion. Explains how to write each part.Read this book to get another angle on screenwriting."
4,Still did not sell screenplay,"Order placed on Aug 24, 2011. Still not allowed in Warner Brothers lot even after telling them I have read this book before writing my spec. Giving 4 stars due to importance of topic."
4,Great storage for narrow space,This was the perfect size in my daughter's dorm room to fit in a small gap between her dresser and the wall and provide extra storage. Functionally it is awesome. The only con is the faux wicker front which actually makes it look cheap rather than better. This piece is 100% plastic - it would have looked sleeker and been more versatile with respect to fitting various decor styles if the manufacturer had skipped the faux finish and just left it flat in front.
5,Nice product for what I needed.,"I really like this drawer organizer. Like other reviewers, I think the ""wicker"" name may be misleading, but that wasn't much of a deal breaker for me. It's more like a ""wicker-look"" on the front, but the item is ALL molded plastic. However, I like the style and design of this organizer. It's small, it fits perfectly where I need it (I will be using it inside of a small ""closet-like"" storage area in my bathroom which is hidden behind a nice curtain). I'll be primarily using it to hold hair products/supplies. The plastic is easy to clean, and the top of the organizer is somewhat recessed, which allows for some additional ""quick pull"" product storage on top, without worrying about the items falling off. I honestly think the price could have been about $10 cheaper, but overall, I am very satisfied with the product."
2,cheap cheap cheap,"recently purchased this item and while it is a great size for a tight space, it's going back because of the cheap quality. it's all molded plastic and the drawers do not slide easily. in addition, as another reviewer had noted, the faux-wicker front is not high an impressive feature.great shipping though - very quick & well packaged, so 2 thumbs up there!"
4,fits in 8 inch space as advertised.,"Very pleased. I agree that the fake basket weave motif e is a bit tacky, but this is in a laundry room, not the living room. The deep bottom drawer is deep enough for big soap container, tall spray canisters, etc. Price was 20% lower than in another catalog."
3,What i was looking for,"I needed something to fit next to our tall front load washer so the cat could have a ""step"" to get to his bed. It needs to be ""wedged"" between items so that it stays put when you open the drawers. It's on rollers and will roll as you open the drawers otherwise. I did not have any huge expectations for the item. It serves its main purpose...a step for the cat! I am enjoying the drawers as extra storage, though. This kind of item is hard to find and I was happy to finally get one."
4,Clutter is Gone,"Useful and nice looking product. I am so glad it was already assembled. Becasue of the wheels, you have to hold onto it with one hand and pull out the drawer with the other. Not a big deal. Overall, nice product for the price."
3,Mediocre,It looks nice when you put it between the washer and dryer but the drawers are hard to pull open and shut. You have to hold onto the whole thing when you pull on a drawer otherwise you end up pulling the whole unit rather than just the drawer. Maybe if you put some heavy items in the bottom drawer it will stay put. Its plastic....its just okay
3,OK product but the picture looks better than the actual product,"It is not deep enough to cover the entire space between the washer and dryer so there is a dead space behind the organizer. Also, the sliding boxes don't have a stopper at the back so at times they slide behind and the organizer has to be reassembled every time that happens."
4,Good buy for the money,"This organizer fit perfectly where I needed it. It is made of very sturdy plastic. The design is wicker - not real wicker. Also, there was no assembly. I would recommend purchasing it."
5,Outrageous Reading & Laughing,"I had a whole mess of Vicki Leon's books in my library. Then, in September 2004 Hurricane Ivan washed away my house, and my beloved library. (I don't miss the old house but I still miss my library and my shoes.) I loved Vicki's books so much, the Uppity Women series especially, that I finally got around to buying them all AGAIN. As a professional motivational speaker and trainer I've pulled stories from Vicki's books into presentations for women's conferences. Though her books are about women of the past the lessons learned relate to today. If you need inspiration and a laugh grab any one of Vicki Leon's books. ""Outrageous Women of the Renaissance"" by Vicki LeÃ³n happens to be one of my favorites."
3,Power Button Defect,I loved this monitor until the power button sunk inside the casing.My power button broke one week after the paltry one year warranty was up.Called HP Customer Support (aka India) and they quoted a repair priceof $360.00 (not including shipping). They would not sell me a replacementbutton for my own installation. They were willing to sell me the same monitor for $400 and change. I paid over $700 for this monitor in November2005. I told Mr. Chowdry I'd take a pass on another one...Buyer Be Very Aware!
2,power button broke,"5 stars for the monitor. no stars for the power button. no stars for hp. a star for effort for costco.i loved the monitor. the speakers were weak but are ok when you just want to hear system sounds. i have external speakers for music. i liked the handy usb outlets.the power button broke a few months ago, close to a year after i got it. hp would do nothing. costco was willing to take it back but i would have needed to return the entire computer bundle. i've been cruise the net every once in a while looking for instructions on repairing the switch. in the meantime, i've been using my dell 2000fp."
4,Great for the price!,"Like the monitor, display is great for the price, the built in speakers i didnt need because of surround sound. The only problem I had was getting the right drivers."
1,Poor power button design is a dealbreaker,"Stay away from this product. Like many others, I was very happy with the picture quality on this monitor. However, 4 weeks out of warranty, the small round power button on the front of the monitor broke (disappearing into the case) which renders the whole monitor useless. HP customer support couldn't care less--they tried to sell me another monitor. HP doesn't even offer any kind of paid-for repair service that would help me recover part of my investment. Since I can see from Google searches that the power button problem is common with the HP F2105 (many are breaking inside the warranty after only light use), you would do well to trust this product no longer than its warranty period."
2,Power button breaks easily,"Yes, this monitor looks great. I like everything about it except for its extremely flimsy power button, which has broken in two different occasions. On both occasions the power button just sank in when pressing it with normal pressure. Once it happens it is almost impossible to turn it on or off so you need to get it replaced. (As a side note, we rarely use the power button because we have a screen saver so it did not happen from excessive use). HP has replaced our monitor 3 times (free of charge), two for the power button issue and another because one of the monitors they shipped was damaged in transit. It looks like this is a serious quality issue. I am not sure if the power button will break again now that we are on our fourth monitor, but we'll probably look for another monitor if it does."
1,Broken Power Button x2,"I purchased my HP Media Center system with the HPf2105 monitor in Feb of 2006. On August 23, 2006 my power button broke and unlike others it dropped on to my desktop! Since it was within the 1 year warranty period, HP promplty sent me a replacement. Here I am 7 months later (just over 30 days outside of my original warranty) and this power button is broken as well. Over an hour on the phone and still waiting to hear what will be done. I'd pass on another HP monitor since they obviously can't last more then 6 months of moderate use."
2,"A couple gems, but...","For the most part, this two-disc compilation is filled with dreck. You know, female vocals that would've made you cringe even back in the 90's, and EXTREMELY cheesy covers (such as The Eurythmics' ""Sweet Dreams"" and Freur's ""Doot Doot."") The 3 or 4 good songs in here can be found elsewhere. If you want good trance, look for any of The Thrillseekers' ""Nightmusic"" albums, or Above & Beyond's ""Anjunabeats"" series, or any of DJ Tiesto's ""Searching For Sunrise"" compilations, just to name a few. They are far and away better than this TranceMixed drivel."
5,Love love love this DVD!,"This DVD is the best postnatal workout compilation that I've found. It's easy to mix and match workouts, Lindsay is very motivating and fun to workout to, and her form is good. I am able to mix things up enough to use this DVD 3-4 times a week without feeling that I'm doing the same thing too much. I rotate in other DVDs on the other days. This is by far my favorite postnatal workout DVD, unfortunately, I still haven't found anything else that even comes close - even of Lindsay's other DVD's, in terms of giving a great workout, getting my heartrate high, and really producing results."
3,Yes it really is too choppy!,This video has a great idea to be able to create your own work out but it's so choppy and repetitive that it's a bit annoying. Her technique and instruction about the core confuses me. I used other videos during my pregnancy and am not to excited about this one. It's just OK.
2,meh,"The way it's set up is very choppy. No flow. Very, very soft music. Nothing to make me want to put it in the dvd player. It's a good concept, just poorly put together. She's a cute instructor, but the workouts are just ok. Reminds me of Tae Bo, which is exactly what I was trying to get away from."
4,lindsay brin is awesome,all her workout videos are grat. this is wpnderful b/c they are about 20min and really work the middle: where after having a baby is where i need most of my workout so awesome!!
5,It may not be easy being a bunny but it sure is fun!,"My toddler son received this book as a gift for his first birthday. It came highly recommended from a teen friend who had treasured it as a childhood favorite. We weren't disappointed. I am not sure if it is the language, simple illustrations, or the premise but he never tires of It's Not Easy Being a Bunny. Not only do we recommend this book, we have already purchased it for other first birthday gifts. We give it an unequivocal A+ rating."
5,We just love this book,"Every kid has this kind of day -- sick of his family, sick of the meals his mom makes, sick of everything -- I should find a new family!P.J. Funnybunny is so cute and so willing to try living with other kinds of animals, but their habits don't suit him at all. And eventually -- home is best."
3,An interesting concept,"This is apparently a ""constructed"" album featuring Glenn Miller and Tommy Dorsey's bands, mostly taking turn playing the same songs. There are seven songs that both bands play, plus six others, probably three each. As a musician and an arranger, I find the concept of this album fascinating, comparing two bands' version of the same songs. I can't imagine that the general listening public would be so entertained by hearing each song repeated. Maybe I'm wrong about that. Actually, I could have easily listened to twice as many instances of ""shared"" songs."
3,Average,"The sound quality is what you would expect from that era, in other words, not extremely good compared with now, but as good as they could record sound back then."
5,"An ""Old School"" Voice Still Rules","After what seems like a lifetime ""hiatus"", one of the premier talents of the 70's and 80's majestically returns with a collection of songs most suited for his brand of sultry soul. Osborne, once the front for the legendary L.T.D., is back in a major way. Each of the twelve tracks showcases the singer at his most seductive.Electrifying is an adjective most appropriate for every cut, from the smooth ""Kreepin'"" to the [emotionally]-charged twosome of ""Soft and Slow"" and ""Work That Body"" to the energetic ""All My Money"" and the oh-so-sexy ""Come With Me,"" the singer keeps the listener under his musical control.The gem, though, is a magnificent ""live"" performance of his classic ""Love Ballad."" This is more than just a revamping; it is a lustrous illustration of why Osborne remains one of the genuinely true vocalists of any generation."
3,jeffreys osborne,"i love jeffrey, but i was alittle disappointed in this album, jeffrey can sing and i am a big fan, ask my friends and family but these songs were more about sex sex. what about love love ?i love jeffrey's love ballads and i want him, peabo, luther , etc to sing of love not just of how you can make me ""feel good"". come on jeff next album sing of love. love and sex should go together but the love is what makes me want to sing."
5,A REAL SINGER!,"Where Are The New Jeffrey Osbourne's at? this Man Still Has Mad Chops.From Back in the day with L.T.D his 80's Run.This Album is a Breath Of Fresh Air.Strong Arrangements,Real Instruments,&More Importantly a Real VOcalist.This is a Soul Album.Very Essential From a Real Artist."
1,The Earth Is A Giant Magnet Magnetism DVD by TMW Media Group,THE EARTH IS A GIANT MAGNETI was REALLY disappointed with this dvd and found it not to be worth the money for the very basic 15 minutes of information it contains becasue you can obtain the info on the internet or youtube for free. I feel like I lost all of my money on this purchase. I feel this is a $10 dollar dvd at best brand new with shipping included.
4,Not Bad for the Price.,"This LaserLight series has consistently offered fine CDs for a bargain price. This disc is no exception. The selections included are very pleasing, and the featured orchestras and conductors are very good. The disc provides fine casual background music when performing some task that requires your close scrutiny. The Vienna Symphonic, London Philharmonic and Hungarian National Philharmonic Orchestras are the featured players. Conductors include Yuri Aronovitch, Laurence Seigel and Adam Fischer. Selections include Smetana's Moldau, Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet, Liszt's Les Preludes and Ravel's Bolero, as the title would suggest.I found the disc to be very entertaining. My only reservation was that I had trouble loading it into my computer, and, although I tried several times, the tunes didn't load in the order of the titles. A small price to pay. This is a worthwhile disc. I recommend it."
1,Vanity Press - Light on ETF,"This is simply a overblown brochure. There were attempts to drive the reader to the writers company web site. Just when you think you are going to gain a better understanding on how ETFs operate, you are directed to contact Chartwell Partners. This book should have a price of $0. There were some helpful hints, such as the mix of certain ETF, but that was about it.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. There are much better guides. I did not do enough research and paid the price."
1,disappointing,"I was very excited to read this book, but I found it less about the subject of healing and more about the transformative experience of the author. I had wished, especially, for some resolution around the healings of the author's two friends who endured a week of treatment in the Amazon. After their healings, they were never mentioned again. I was disappointed."
3,Slow Going,"I am teaching myself arabic. I have previous knowledge of the script and picked this up to increase my vocabulary and learn the linguistics of the language. This book is helpful, yet there are some significant drawbacks. The printing (of arabic) is too small. Also, it shows both type and handwritten form, which is practical, but just adds to a learners confusion. Very fast paced, my advice is to have some knowledge of arabic, or linguistics and grammer in general before approaching this book. I am only part way through, and find the vocabulary and teaching style pratical and well designed, but some previous knowledge of language is required. But hey, who said teaching yourself anything would be easy? Keep trying!"
4,"Good, but short.","Eight clouds rising is the story of two young men. One is a college student who travels from Tokyo to a small shrine in the mountains during a festival that only occurs every 49 years in order to get his long dead grandfather's sword purified. The other is the 16 year old son of the temple's highest priest, who has strange and dark powers and becomes the wielder of one of 7 sacred swords.It is comprised of two 30 minute parts, and the ending, while completing a piece of the story, is by no means a resolution. We can probably expect a series, or at least another video in the future."
4,"Eight clouds rising,Vol 1","Interesting storyline.Although a complete story,feels like the story could continue.Enjoyed this movie very much,thank you"
1,Really Bad Cd!,this cd is really bad!!!!! nothing compared to reverance their frist cd. The only song worth listening to is tak the long way home but buy the maxi singel don't waste your money on this cd its horrible and I am disappointed that Faithless even put a cd out like that after the smash hit INSOMNIA. DJHike
5,Awsome follow-up,"First it was Reverence, then came Sunday 8PM. If you liked the first album, don't hesitate buy this one. In the beginning you may get dissapointed because this CD is very different than Reverence. But listen to it a few times, and you might even feel that this is better. Not som much trip-hop as in the first one, they have added som soul to it. Postcards is awesome. The same is Take The Long Way Home, God Is A DJ, and Killer's Lullaby. GET THIS ONE NOW."
5,Solid CD,"Faithless is a band from the UK that is becoming more well-known these days because of Dido. Her brother, Rollo, is the leader of this group along with Maxi Jazz and Sister Bliss. Sunday 8pm is a great listen all the way through with the highlight being the track, God Is a DJ. This is an unbelievable track that would get anyone dancing. Dido's song, ""My Lover's Gone"", is used in Postcards, which is one of the best tracks. She also sings on Hem of His Garment. Even Boy George guest vocals on this CD singing on Why Go? The Garden and Killer's Lullaby are other outstanding tracks. If you like techno/electronica music and especially Massive Attack as well as Dido, then you need to buy this CD."
5,Change of mind?,"I confess. Near Jazz I was more or less in Pop, Blues and R & R only. But Faithless gave me a new kick. Lyric, Soul and Techno are coming together and it works! Indeed. I'm waiting with impatience for their gig in my area. I'm quite sure a great evening is coming up...."
4,Black Loincloth Of Lady Ninja!,"This work is not too interesting as the story that treats the lady ninja. However, Lead actress's Yommi is cool and beautiful.And, the point that she is tightening a black loincloth is real and epoch-making. The loincloth is a traditional undergarment of Japan, and the samurai and the ninja should wear it.When her change of clothes and she highly kick the enemy, the black loincloth can be clearly confirmed to our eyes. And, the undergarment digs into firmly between her groins and is very sexy."
2,Ho Hum...,"This is an ""erotic"" Japanese ninja movie, though the use of ""erotic"" is somewhat generous. Given anything below the waist is covered up over there (except for maybe the hardcore XXX stuff), all that's really left is the action, which is what you see in direct to video movies. Save your money, I wish I had."
1,mobiles: how to creat them,"i was unable to order this item through amazon, who knows why.... i had to order it through crystal publicationsand i actually got it cheaper there. i cannot order items through amazon, but i can through ebay; so i do notrecommend ordering anything through amazon. go to crystal productions-they have great how to videos."
4,A Patient Lover,"This book focuses on Kenneth, an private investigator and Daisy, a Florist. Kenneth lives in Kansas and Daisy lives in Guthrie. Kenneth visits Daisy in hopes of getting her to marry him, but Daisy is all wrap-up, tied-up and tangled-up in her Flower Shop and her upcoming Garden Show. This is a good read, not too happy with the ending, but maybe a sequel is in the making."
4,Love Had To Be Cultivated To Grow,"Daisy Rogers garden shop owner first meets private investigator Kenneth Gunn in ""Simply Wonderful"" when she find him beaten and thrown in her green house. Months later they are maintaining a long distant relationship between Kansas and Oklahoma or where ever Kenneth job takes him. He is headed to OK to see Daisy after six week, to help her with her first flower show. The keynote speaker for the show is murderd, but the show must go own. Not knowing who can be trusted beside each other they try and get to the bottom, but before they do a second murder is committed. Daisy is trying to hold onto her independence as Kenneth is trying to convice her they belong together as husband and wife. When the murders are solved and it's time for Kenneth to go back to work, Daisy relizes she doen't want him to leave, she lets him know only to realize the love they share has gone from ""Simply Wonderful"" to ""Simply Marvelous."""
3,"The movie is boring, but the kung fu makes up for most of it","I think this movie has pretty good looking kung fu, especially at the end of the movie. You won't believe how long the last fight scene is-nearly seven minutes long! The other fight scenes throughout this movie are okay, although sometimes the movements seem a bit slow. Though the action is good, I think everything else pretty much stinks. I mean when there isn't any fighting, the movie is just plain boring. The storyline just isn't interesting enough. Throughout the movie, Jackie meets like a whole bunch of stupid characters. The most annoying one is this stupid old man who keeps appearing from nowhere. The movie also has very bad lighting. In some parts of the movie, like in the dark, you can't even see anything. If you like watching kung fu, and don't care about a stupid storyline, then you should go and buy this one. You can watch the movie over and over again just for the amazing fight scenes."
4,Interesting the second time,"While yes it's not the greatest Jackie Chan film ever made it still deserves some credit. Overlooking the very bad camera work, editing, and the extrememly horrible dubbing of the worst kind yet, the bad sound effects, and the worst lighting of any movie i've ever seen, and you'll find a really really great movie! I'm 98% serious. For it's time, 1977, it is really good and if u rent martial arts movies for only one reason and that is for the action, then this movie is chock fulla the nessecery essentials u crave. One last thing: watch it at least twice because the first once or twice you watch it is to ""desensitize"" you to the horrid quality of it so u can see the tru beauty of this one-of-a-kind movie."
3,This movie is okay,"If you like Jackie Chan's old Kung-Fu movies, then you'll like this one. It doesn't have the slap-stick of his later movies when he exerted more control over his films, but it has some good fighting, and somehow Jackie's charming personality manages to come through. This one is unusual in that Jackie's character is a self-assured King-Fu master at the beginning, not the Keatonesque under-dog of his later films. Worth the price of a rental!"
5,a replacement puppy,"we had to order this puppy because we lost our original baby whiffer. my daughter got this puppy the day she was born (she is almost 4 now.) she was heartbroken,so we had to get a new one asap! the baby whiffer arrived earlier than we expected and was perfect! he looked so much cleaner than ""original puppy"". we were extremely pleased with this purchase. i almost cried when ""new puppy"" arrived. the reason i have differentiated between ""original puppy"" and ""new puppy"" is because we found ""original puppy"" about a week later!!!! it all worked out and now my daughter has 2 awesome puppies. thank you so much!"
3,Entertaining But Lightweight,"This was an interesting book, enjoyable and an easy read. It is a good jumping off point for futher in-depth investigation. I wouldn't take everything here at face value (and the author doesn't really expect you to). It has encouraged me to read opposing view points on subjects like the Alamo and the Rough Riders. It has helped remind me that there are sometimes several different points of view to one story. I would recommend it but remember it's just one more side of history."
4,There's a lot of bunko in this world...,"...but Richard Shenkman tries to give us the critical eye to spot it. This book, though dated and somewhat sketchy in places, at least has the gumption to stir up controversy and allow us to see that history is not the cut-and-dried, ""objective"" science we've been led to believe. The lists in this book are incomplete, they often contain unproven assertions, and sometimes are a little slipshod. However, no claim is made that these are the final facts, but rather that these are alternate, iconoclastic views that allow you to approach history, not as a sponge to absorb the broad assertions of which teachers are so fond, but as a critically thinking human being ready to separate the wheat from the chaff. Enjoy in good health and don't believe anything just because somebody told it to you!"
3,interesting; well researched,"This book makes you initially hate the author for violating some sacred cows of history (such as, Davy Crockett surrenderedat the Alamo and did not die fighting off the hordes of Mexicans), but because of the scope of the topics and the depth with which each one was researched, one can appreciate history more fully."
4,Good Read,I like this book for when I am on the train...not so in-depth that it requires a lot of concentration.
1,Sensationalism,"Sorry folks, this is not a serious book by any standards. Much of what Shenkman has to say is either unproved speculation or purposeful misunderstanding of events and indeed of history itself. Please do not take this as a serious effort. It is not."
5,"Legends, Lies, and cherished Myths",Excellent source for my undergraduate students who are studying to become secondary social studies teachers.thanks!!Dave Kowalka
2,Disappointing,"The premise is good, but the book simply moves from topic to topic too quickly. The author seems to delight in pointing out these untrue myths and legends, and he is able to document these claims via footnotes and bibliography, but there is no in depth discussion of these myths. Instead the book is full of disjointed sentences which form very short chapters and then your on to the next topic. For a more scholarly approach to the same topic, try ""Lies My Teacher Told Me : Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong"" by James Loewen"
4,The real history behind traditional history,"""Most Americans know very little history. Unfortunately,most of the history they know is wrong."" Exploring this premisemakes for an interesting and informative book. Icons of ourtraditional history become living people complete with wartsand foibles. Shenkman shows how our history has become rewrittenover time to sound more patriotic and to help decendants offamous people make themselves sound important."
4,"Legends, Lies, and Cherished Myths of American History","I own two other books by R. Shenkman, which I liked, so I Iooked for another book of his to read. I hope his info is accurate because its fun to read."
5,It's changed my life....,"Great Product. I just have the headset (i.e. not the auto-responder, which I am about to buy). The headset is very light and unobtrusive. Reception is great - I love pacing my office as I talk - no more shouting at the speaker phone. I get 50ft easily, and can get up to about 100 feet, through a couple of walls without dropping the call. (At these extremes, I get the beep that tells me I am at the limits, but my respondent does not notice the difference). Have had absoultely no problems with this - and I can't think of another piece of electronic equipment that I can say that about."
1,50 foot? Not even 50 inches,"I had high hopes for this item but ended up returning the product in the end. You gotta love the concept of absolutely no wires but being first isn't always best when it doesn't work.The product promised a range of 50 feet but standing next to the base, the unit kept complaining about out of range.It was a very hard decision to return as the ""no wires"" was great. But, without really working right the unit was useless."
5,It's The Real Thing,"As a 23 year railroader now on disability due to Multiple Sclerosis this book brought back in vivid detail some of my experiences. This is an insiders delight and let's the world reallyknow what's going on, on the Rails. I was always told never to just stand around on the job but to do something. This wonderful book does everything to open a hidden world to the public."
5,Railroad voices - the real thing,"This is one of the best railroad books I have read in my 30+ years in the railroad industry, and I found it difficult to put down. I have shared my copy with my railroad colleagues, including several women, who all said they enjoyed it immensely, and want their own copies.The two women have a gift for capturing the true essence of our industry. Ms. Niemann writes in the language of the trainmen's locker rooms, switch shanties and locomotive cabs, a mixture of railroad slang and profanity, but, that is the way it really is.Lina Bertucci's photos truly convey the sense of never-ending fatigue, boredom, grime, that was (is) part of railroading, then and now. (I also had the pleasure of knowing Ms. Bertucci and some of her female co-workers when they became the first women hired by the Milw RR for train service in the '70s. Those women fought some real barriers to be accepted in what had been a all-male environment.)"
4,Kellogg's traditional tales are terrific!,"Steven Kellogg has been a favorite author and illustrator of mine since he visited my school library in 3rd grade--17 years ago! Now, as a first year Kindergarten teacher, I am sharing his books with my class, and they have really come alive for me, again. His traditional tale interpretations are creative, intricate and hilarious--not to mention beautiful. My favorite part of his Three Little Pigs tale is the illustration on the back jacket, which shows the wolf retired to a beach in Florida. He wears a tank top that pleads, 'thugs need hugs, too'. Also see Kellogg's version of Jack in the Beanstalk if your children love deliciously scary read-alouds!"
4,nice illustrations,"The illustrations are all I looked at when ordering. Now I see that the text is a sweetie pie modern version, all the pigs with cute names and so on. I was hoping for the traditional story."
1,Not much to say................,It has hits bloopers and fights but not worth more then 5 dollars including shipping.
2,Inferior Product,"I purchased a Genie Excellerator (1/2 HP) about two years ago and have had problems with it off and on since the beginning. Installation was a little difficult; the screw and metal beam that houses it come in several pieces and are very flimsy. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't --A common problem is that the motor is very weak and requires great effort to raise my garage door. At this point, the motor is simply dying a slow and miserable death so I am going to replace it with a 3/4 HP LiftMaster."
5,"Este libro no nos critica,","nos pone sobre aviso sobre LO QUE NO DEBEMOS HACER CON NUESTROS HIJOS, como la sobreprotecciÃ³n o su contraria: LA NEGLIGENCIA...Y en realidad, es un libro cariÃ±oso para los padres de familia...Y evitar 10 errores no es tan difÃ­cil como andar a tomtas y a ocas resolviendo los problemas que se presentan SOBRE LA MARCHA..Este libro es PARA EVITAR PROBLEMAS A LOS NIÃOS Y A NOSOTROS MISMOS..."
3,Enormous talent but where headed?,"I still think Tuskugee Experiments is Mr Byron's most satisfying album. There is no doubting the talent on offer on IVEY DIVEY but to me it sounds like a practice session or at least an album suggested by the A and R man at EMI rather than something fully in tune with (what I perceive to be) Mr Byron's artistic possibilities. When he was playing I confess I was thinking of Jimmy Guiffre and his great trio work of ""free"" music on ECM and his other great album on Columbia and what the trio before us are capable of - my God!! Either get together some great arrangements or let the music go where it may whereas the album before us seems to fall between those two stools."
4,"Fascinating, But Difficult","Bentham's ideas are brilliant. However, a reader should be aware that his work is dense, difficult, and often hard to decipher. I found his arguments to be some of the most applicable to my training as a social scientist, but that was largely after a thorough review of his work and lengthy discussions with those more knowledgeable of his arguments."
4,utilitarianism,"this is a readable piece of philosophy, that lays out the basics of his utilitarianism. the book itself is high quality."
4,"Love the series, love the video","Hi-5, which airs on the Discovery Channel (and TLC) has several different themes. Each week a new theme is introduced by a catchy song & dance that is played at the beginning and end of each episode. Different sketches throughout the episode cover simple math, music, rhythm, imagination, language development, etc.Having said that, if you love the show, you'll love all three of the DVDs which contain three episodes of their respective theme. The ""extras"" aren't really great - a karaoke singalong one with lyrics and the other with only music and words on the bottom of the screen. I'd have liked some more background on the making of the show or a little extra addition to the episode. (That's why it receives a 4 and not a 5)."
5,Best new children's show!,"Hi-5 is fresh, education and fun--even for the parents! This is one show where mom and dad will actually enjoy sitting with the kids and watching it! :) Color Craze is a unique way of incorporating colors into math, problem solving, word recognition, shapes and exercise.""I want to watch Hi-5!...with YOU!!"" my son yells each morning.A++++++++Angie in Utah"
1,Complete Nonsense,"Wow. What a disappointment. I should have done research. I thought this was a SERIOUS mentod for fear, anxiety, negativity, etc via REAL STRAGETIES. I thought this guy was some kind of a doctor (a REAL one) or expert. Instead, this is one of those ""sit back and relax and listen to funeral music while I tell you what you WANT to hear, even if it is totally untrue."" It's a hypnotist kind of thing, which I do not believe in after years of research. Any moron can relax if they try hard enough. I wanted STRATEGY, GOALS, proactive solutions. This bores you to sleep, thus creating the illusion that you are ""at peace."" I am returning this tomorrow."
1,big problem,"This feeder looks great, but the squirrel baffle sits so low on top of the feeder you cannot possibly reach the tubes. This means completely disassembling the feeder to refill it! AND it won't fit onto any pole but the one specially designed for it which is expensive, sold seperatly, and is carried by no one.Very disappointing!"
1,major problem,"This feeder looks great, but the squirrel baffle sits so low onto the feeder you cannot possible reach to refill the tubes. This means completely disassembling the feeder in order to refill it! AND it does not fit onto either a standard feeder pole or even onto poles made by the same company. You have to buy the pole that is specially made for this feeder, which is expensive and I have yet to find anyone who carries it."
1,Save Your Money!,"This is NOT durable and doesn't hold a lot of clothes. What I've put on there are basic shirts, dresses and skirts, no heavy material and all garments are between size 2-4. It's not even completely full and it warped and broke.I'll try another brand (metal this time) and see how durable it is."
3,"One of the first ""Early Music"" ensembles","I spent two summers at the Trapp Family music camp when I was small, and used to go to their concerts at Town Hall in New York as a child in the 1950s. They were among the first to popularize what we now call ""Early Music,"" music composed prior to 1750. Musically and musicologically untrained, they nevertheless performed with impeccable taste a repertoire that was largely unknown to American audiences. I have been involed with Early Music performance for a very long time, and recognize the shortcomings of their approach, but nevertheless appreciate what they have done for the genre, and their absolutely sincerity and integrity in their performances. This recording includes many of the beloved pieces they used to sing at Camp and on their tours and concerts, so it is also quite nostalgic for me. I am glad to see it re-released on CD; my old - and I mean OLD - LP looks like a potato chip, and some of this music isn't available elsewhere."
5,great gift,Bought this for my mom as a gift... she loves the Sound of Music and it's history and is recently retired. She loved reading more of the history of the family.
5,ClASS A Cherub book 2,My Grandson loved this book. He was very slow at reading and has now caught up with the rest of the class and always has a book in his hand. This book was recommended by one of my other grandsons I was pleased that Jacob liked it and hope to buy more
3,They get worse than before,"I wrote a review of how in the cherub series the books get worse and worse as you go on in the series. Well this second book is a clear example, as I was very hooked with the first book but not the second one or third, fourth and so on."
3,CHERUB Class a,"I really love this series, Class A has a strong reference to drugs throughout the story, although there is some good morals here, It's probably the worst Cherub book but a great book to read just the same.Age 12-15"
3,Like the first edition the best!,"I LOVE Hemalayaa's first Bollywood DVD. And since I loved it so much, I have tried two of her other Bollywood DVD's, Bollywood Boogie and Bollywood Belly .. unfortunately both of those left me disappointed. I was bored after the first 10 minutes with both of them and actually stopped the workout because of it. If you are looking to buy a Bollywood workout DVD go for Hemalayaa's original one. It is by far the best one, in my opinion. I honestly wouldn't waste my time with the others."
4,Valuble information for book report,The work of Shannon and Weaver was good. Maybe this book should be used in more classrooms as text book.
3,Clarification,"Just a clarification of the synopsis offered by amazon (or newsweek) above. Although Go was published in 1952,5 years before On The Road, by Jack Kerouac, Kerouac had actually written On The Road in 1950 and it took him 7 years to get it published. Part of the problem was he had to get signed releases from everyone in the book, himself. Also, he had to change the names of towns, etc. There was a bit of tension between Holmes and Kerouac, but for the Beat scholar, Kerouac's novel can't be touched. On The Road stands alone. However, to be fair, and see another's view of things, Go is a fine book as well."
3,Go: a Beat journal,"A hard to find novel, and one I thought would be as entertaining as it is legendary. However, I found myself for much of the book wanting to put it down. It had at times, the trite voice of another young author putting too many words to too many pages. While it is a good chronicle of Beat life, illuminating more truth than perhaps On The Road might even. And perhaps thats it failure... it failed to gloss over too many blasie days and focus on the story... Id say... if you love the Beats, read it. But if yr looking to find out more about the Beats, read the more popular works and leave Go for later. Finally, if you do read it, and you find yr self dosing as often as I, skip to page 270. Assuming you know the Beats, Holmes story starts here."
5,This book is one of the best I have ever rea,"I think that when it comes to the beat generation there is no other book to cronicle it. GO really gives you the base charactarization that can allow you to understand even further the other beat generation works. Especially allen ginsberg, and jack kerouac."
3,OK for the money,"The quality of manufacture leaves a little to be desired, but if you're after trashy lingerie at the right price, then this is it!"
2,Vornado AQS 15 replacement hepa filter,"While I like the Vornado Air Purifier, the replacement filters are way too expensive. Because I have pets in the house, hepa filters are the best option, but they should not be this expensive."
4,Works well,"It does work and keeps the air fresh - I didn't change mine for literally years (I would take it out and hand clean it periodically which I don't think hurts anything, but finally I decided I had better get a new one.It is quite easy to remove and put back in, no problem there, seems a simple process.Seems tremendously expensive when you see what it is - but maybe there's something I'm not understanding in the technology of making it. As I said though I did go several years (more than 5, with regular use), before I replaced it. Cheaper than a whole new air purifier."
1,too expensive,"Like other reviewers, I have two vornado air purifiers which works great, but the HEPA filter is ridiculously expensive and lasts barely 2 months before it loses significant air flow. I've decided to dump the vornado air purifier and got a different brand with ""lifetime"" hepa filter that doesn't need replacing."
5,Perfect,"Good instructions and if you want to install it in an '03-'06 Chevy truckyou'll want this:Hayes 81780 Quik Connect Dual Mated Chev/GMC 2007-2003 Wiring Harnesswhich I also bought here on Amazon. Installation was quick and easy.One thing I did different was I used two of my own sheet metal screws to install itsince Chevy had left me a couple holes that lined up. If you install it on the right side like most people do above the accelerator, you'll be putting to the far right close to the doghouse (transmission cover) and you'll need a 1/4"" wrench to tighten the screws on that side so pre-start them once. I used my Makita drill with a 1/4"" bit and pre-tapped them.This is a great little unit."
4,The Aura of Love - (captivating),"This was a side read for me, other than the book our club scheduled for the month. I like science fiction, but never read a science fiction, love story, suspense book like ""The Aura of Love"" before. Kathy J. Marsh has done an excellent job of keeping the drama and suspense real, but also making the interaction between Remy and Jace on a level that we all can relate to. The prejudice between the purple and blue Auralites, levels on how African Americans related in the past and in current days. The way the characters take a twist and turn will keep you turning the pages as fast as you can. It was one of the best books I have read in a while. It was my first time reading anything by Kathy Marsh, and I can't wait to read another book with her as an author, just to see if this was a one time thing (smiles).""Aura of Love"" is a book I will put into our book club selection, for my other club members to read!Reviewed by Claudia - from ""WE BE BOOK'N BOOK CLUB"""
4,A Pleasant New Perspecive,I thoroughly enjoyed this book- the concept is so fresh and innovative and the characters so relatable that you can't help but wonder what will happen next!
5,Wonderful Christian Music for Weddings,"This young man is able through his music to add warmth and love. The Lord is present in ALL his songs as they radiate his love for the important people in his life. We used three songs from this one CD for our daughters wedding. We even used Fathers Love. It had everyone in tears as a fathers love, Kelley's dad and our heavenly fathers was felt throughout the room. You won't find a better CD anywhere to help put speical touches on that wonderful day."
5,I loved it! Every dad should love there kids as much as B.C,"If everyone served God and loved there kids as much as B.Carlisle this world would be a better place. We fall down we get up is a moving song. Also father's love excellent stuff to fill your mind with, compared to some of the secular stuff out there today."
3,No Stories To Be Told Here,"Unfortunately, this album does not top Butterfly Kisses. Instrumentally, Bob Carlisle has done nothing new here. In fact, he takes the rich melody of his Butterfly Kisses album down a notch, and leaves the listener with a monotone expression of himself, and a forced attempt to reach the sentimentality of his previous album. If you already have Butterfly Kisses, then just listen to that. If you don't have it, get that album instead of this one."
5,Great Holiday Music!,"One of the best jazz X-mas recordings I have heard. Wonderfull guitar playing in solo, duet, and quartet settings."
4,Confusing reissue of very good album,"Just to clarify things for fans of fondly remembered jazz guitarist Joe Pass: he recorded a Christmas album, ""Six-String Santa"" (1992), for - unlikely as it seems - budget label LaserLight Records, a division of Delta Entertainment. Delta reissued the CD in 2001 as ""Christmas Guitar Dreams"" but they didn't change the catalog number or the barcode, so Amazon shoppers will find both listed in the Marketplace. You'll have to contact your seller to figure out which is which - if you care, that is. The music is the same; I have uploaded images of both CD's.In 2003, Delta also issued a version for the Spanish language market with a different cover and all the song titles translated into espanol. Entitled ""Sueno Navideno Con Guitarra,"" it is listed separately on Amazon.Overall, most listeners will enjoy this album tremendously - soothing without lapsing into smooth. Not the equal, perhaps, of similar albums by Kenny Burrell or Charlie Byrd, but just fine, nonetheless."
1,Jackie's worst movie,"I am a huge Jackie Chan fan, and have been long before the Rumble in the Bronx bandwagon. But this is his worst movie yet. The opening 'comedy' credits go on forever and aren't even funny. The final fight scene isn't bad, but nowhere near enough to make up for the agonising lead up. People may get the impression that all of his movies are this bad! Check out 'Drunken Master 2', 'Police Story', 'Police Story 3: Supercop', or 'Who Am I?' which are only a few of his much superior movies ('Drunken Master 2' being his best)."
1,Ugh.,"Extremely lame martial arts highlight this ""nutty"" spoof of actual martial arts films. Skip this one."
1,ORIGINAL IS BETTER,"If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting Jackie Chan's movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to ""Americanize"" and ""Control"". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way ENTIRE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to ""French version"" or ""Chinese Version"" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap ""American version"" then~! LOL"
4,Very Funny!,"This is one of Jackie Chan's old style Kung-Fu movies (set in old days and no stunts), but it's very funny and full of Jackie's trademark slapstick charm. The supporting characters are very enjoyable too."
4,Fun Kung Fu,This movie has some great Kung-Fu in it and you get to see that Jackie Chan is great at physical comedy.
1,Choose another guide!,"I chose this guide to go to Spain. Luckily I was travelling another girl using the Lonely Planet guide, or I would have been screwed! There are *no* ciy maps in this guide. I looked over the book before buying it, and the lack of maps did not hit me right away. However, upon arriving in Spain and not having any means to get *anywhere*, I really missed them!Unless you plan to visit a tourist office in every city and can pick up a map there, I highly recommend skipping this one and getting the LP or even Let's Go over this book."
4,Excellent product,"Over the years, I have purchased 4 different excellent stereo Bluetooth headsets through Amazon.This very small product provides UNBEATABLE storage flexibility. If you choose not to use the fabulous & innovative pendant-style design feature, it is small enough to fit nearly anywhere. Since I'm often away from an electric outlet or computer for far longer than 6 hours, I'm have purchased 2 more to insure that I always have a charged headset available. Because, each charge actually holds for 6 hours, this has worked very well for me. I may buy a 4th to make my transcontinental travel days even easier.The only reason I didn't provide a 5 star rating is that I would prefer either a smaller earpiece or one the securely fits in my ear canal.UPDATE = As a temporary solution, until I locate smaller earpieces, I use Scotch clear tape to hold them on. Each strip of tape can be used 3 or 4 times."
4,"A good book, but a very strange ending","This was definitely the kind of book that makes the reader think. In it, the main character, Morwenna, accidently inherits the last five wishes left over from the creation of the world. At first she is overjoyed, untill she realizes the rules: she can't wish for anything for herself, she can't tell anyone about the wishes, and if she uses up all five wishes she'll die. This gets especially complicated when she has to use up several of the wishes to save her friends. The ending came as a complete surprise, and I have to admit, it was more than a little disturbing. Did Morwenna learn anything? I guess that's for the reader to decide. I had expected something redeeming to happen and for everything to turn out all right for everyone but I was wrong. It was sort of like well, what was the point of the story? Well, despite this I liked it, and I would reccamend it to any fantasy fan."
5,A Mind Trip Behind the Curtain of Time,"I read Bright Shadow when I was 10 years old. After that I read it over twice. Then I started reading AVI books nonstop. I highly recommend this book. Morwenna is given five wishes by Pindel, the old wizard. Be prepared to have your mind in a trance as Morwenna discovers the truth about her new life and how she must use the five wishes as wisely as posible, or else..."
3,Not as good as I'd hoped.,"I have been a fan of Avi's since 'The True Confessions of Charolate Doyle'. He's written some amazing books, in all kinds of genras, but this one just didnt add up to his normal standard. From the beginning there is a problem with no solution. I kept waiting for one of Avi's famous ending twists, but there was none, and when I finished the book I frowned said, hmm, so much for clasic Avi style, maybe he just wrote it to make another dollar. It was not bad, as far as average books go, but for Avi, I was expecting better."
5,5 Out Of 5,"As good as I remembered it from when I was about 13 years old.I loved Wa Wa Nee way back in the day and surprisingly the music is still kind of relevant today. Even with the overwhelming amount of keyboards. If someone released 'One and One' today as a new single I'm sure it would be a hit all over again.Where were Wa Wa Nee when Boom Crash Opera, Noiseworks, UnCanny X-men and other bands of the like tried to reform on the back of an 80's revival.Long Live the 80's and it's music.R.I.P. Stretch Denim jeans and Denim Jackets."
4,Fun book!,"Too bad this is out of print. It's a very simple book, each page has a picture of a halloween creature, & the only text is the sound it makes (ie ghost, black cat, wolf...). My 2 year old loves hearing the sounds & trying to make them himself. And it's nice & short on each page for those times he's not in the mood for a lot of text."
2,dog bone,Not for a dog that chews...which is all of them. But especially aggressive chewers like my 10 month old terrier. Big chunks come off and get swallowed. That can't be good for them. Steer away from these.
1,Dog Hates It...,"Bought this for my German Shepherd dog and he won't touch it. It's been sitting here for weeks and we've tried many times to make it appealing through play/encouragement/even slathering with peanut butter to no avail. Big waste of money. He likes rawhide much better. Still looking for a safer, lower-calorie alternative to bones and sticks that provides chewing pleasure."
3,"Good texture, dog lost interest","This chew toy is a good texture for my dog- not too hard so that I am afraid of him breaking his teeth but not so soft that he is chewing pieces off. My dog is a very strong chewer and he has not, as of yet, taken chunks out of this toy. I have not yet left him alone with it, though, as I have read other reviews which say strong chewers can take this toy apart. The main downside is this toy only moderately holds my dog's interest. He was pretty excited about it the day I got it, but since then his interest slowly declined and now he hardly looks at it."
3,Just okay,"I was a little wary with this product before purchasing. But after it arrived my puppies didn't really take to it and after reading the instructions that said to monitor when in use so that the dog doesn't ingest more than a ""grain of rice"" size fo the product...I felt better about going with bully sticks. A little more expensive, but worth it!"
2,Potentially dangerous,"The instructions manual says that pieces no bigger than a grain of rice should break off. However, I just watched my dog chew off a piece about the size of a nickel and another one the size of a dime. I'm glad he didn't have enough time to try to eat it. This product is going in the trash."
2,Way too Soft,"I have a medium sized dog, and unlike the normal Nylabones that break into rice sized pieces, this one comes off in chunks. Dog threw up for days trying to get rid of large undigestable plastic in his stomach. Tossed it into the garbage and would not recommend."
4,"Pretty good, not perfect","These headphones are great for running. Their twist-to-fit system looks funky but works well. I never have problems with them falling out of my ears while running. It comes with several different sizes of the rubber discs and guards around the ear bud, so most likely you can find something that'll fit your ear.Just a few negatives:I lost the green rubber guard around the ear bud when it came off when I took the ear phones off. Since they're interchangable guards, I guess it kinda comes off easily.The cord length is not adjustable, unlike the stadard headphones that come with iPods. The left cord is made longer than the right, which is ok. But the difference in cord length is too much for me. I don't think the left cord needs to be so damn long."
3,"Good athletic fit, sub-par sound","Well, despite the numerous reviews questioning the quality of these headphones I decided to buy a set but now I wish I hadn't. These headphones do have a very snug fit and if you are going to use them to work out but the quality really leaves a lot to be desired. I searched for headphones to replace the generic iPod earbuds that I lost but even those cheap headphones had a better sound than this. I've bought Sennheisers before and was delighted with them but this series was a real disappointment. It seems whenever I switch from one genre of music to another I have to change the EQ settings to make it sound well which I've never had to do before.Too many cons with this item and none of them to do with the color."
4,Could have been 5 stars,"The twist to fit system is a really good one. I spend a lot of time at the gym doing cardio and I never have it come loose or fall out of my ear. The sound quality is also exceptional for such inexpensive headphones. My major complaint is that the left earphone is on a shorter cord than the right earphone. In essence making it only useful to have my MP3 player on my left shoulder. I prefer it being on the opposite arm. I end up either having to do that or switch them to opposite ears. I am not an audiophile by a shot, but I am sure there is a good reason why they are labeled L and R in the first place. I like that there are a number of pads so you can choose which one you are most comfortable with as well. Some people dont like the color and, while I cant blame them because it is vibrant and loud, I really dont care overmuch. Overall, I would say these have more plusses than minuses."
4,Excellent product but not perfect,"The MX75's are the best headphone I have ever used for working out. They stay in your ear with the interesting twist to fit feature. They blow away the headphones that come with the ipod nano. The sound quality is great and I do not have the problem of sweat in my ears interfering with the headphones. I would have given the phones a 5 star rating except for 2 minor complaints. The neon green is a bit much. I am not a fan of different lengths of wire going to each headphone. It may sound like a good design idea, but it bugs me. With that said, for about 35 bucks, these headphones are a bargain!"
4,Good headphones,"I have been using these headphones during running for 2 months now and they are functioning very well. Many others had already begun to fail in one or both ears by now. The fit is good except one of the pads came off and was lost soon after getting the headphones and I had to switch to a different size pad since without the pad it pokes the ear and hurts. Also, one of the rings around the speaker came off and was lost so I had to switch to the foam covers. All-in-all I would have to say that I am happy with this product, I just wish that it came with replacement peices for the parts that come off and can be lost. It only has a single pair of each size.The best part is that they DO NOT fall out of the ear no matter how hard you try."
1,THIS THING SUCKS,The twist to fit does not work very well. They are very uncomfortable. Not the best sound quality. I was adjusting the bud in my ear (which you have to do often to try and make it more comfortable) and it snapped off of the bar that connects to the bud. Now it is holding on by the wires and starting to make a cracking sound. I recommend that you do NOT buy these.
3,Not Impressed,"I purchased these headphones because I had heard great things about them. Personally, I was not impressed with the sound quality or the fit. I'm a runner and I need headphones that would not slip out of my ears after sweating and running. But these were not only umcomfortable but would still slip out even after changing the different adjustments. I had also heard great things about the sound quality but I was surely let down. For the mean time, they'll do."
2,"Sound is O.K, FIT and Hardware blah","The earphones does not fit all. I can tolerate it and I think my ears has gotten used to it, but I've had my fare of rashes to get to that point.Also the cord sheating is not as durable considering it's a sports earphones. My cord ended up having cracks up and down the whole thing. The wire inside started showing. I bought it because I hear sennheiser was pretty good with sound and I wanted to hear my audio while working out (gyms can be noisy) and the sound did end up being pretty decent. But it seems like the hardware is pretty flimsy and fragile. I treated it like any normal earphones and cheaper ones didn't get cracks in it's cord.Oh yeah and the pads for the earphones kept falling off. I'd sometimes lose it without knowing."
