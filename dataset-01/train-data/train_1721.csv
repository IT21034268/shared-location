5,Safety first,"I like this device. It is cheap and once it is jammed into the door the right way, it would certainly make it a pain for someone to get in. At the very least it would cause them to make enough noise to make you aware to their presence, which is certainly better than the alternative."
4,can count on it,"one of the good security bar I've purchased. One thing though is it doesn't work well in a carpeted floor, i need to place a hard plastic floor mat for it to really jam the door."
4,Master Lock - dual-Function Security Bar,The Master Lock - Dual-Function Security Bar is an excellent item for a quick peace of mind and security.The adjustable bar is very convenient.
2,lamo,"well, I recieved this item and one end was completely broken off and taped to it.so i spent 12 dollars on garbage, buut i did make a return in which amazon blamedpackaging. Only good part is it didnt cost me money."
1,Save Your Money,"This may or may not work for you. I tried it on a smooth linoleum floor and it's pretty bad. Any level of dust or pet hair would make this weaker. The construction is 'ok' for $15, but not super. Not sure why you would use this as a sliding glass door bar since you can cut a dowel to size for about $2."
2,"Master Lock Door bar, the good and the BAD.","Good:There is a solid feel to the bar, but it is also light weight.The grippy rubber foot makes it quite secure against tile.I also like that the fork is removable so you can use it to hold a sliding door closedBad:The spring loaded pin that holds the bar to size doesn't always hold it properly - it is a very weak point in the design. If you forget to lock your door, you can force the door open even with the bar in place. The pin will not hold.Continuously wedging the tool between the floor and your doorknob causes the doorknob to slide up on the door - you may need to tighten the entire mechanism.Finally, the concept is flawed - I won't post how, but it can be defeated in seconds.Overall while this product does give you some confidence, it is not really very effective due to the flaws - you may want to look at a competing product such as the Door Club."
4,Can anyone help with this product?,"I desperately need this product but am not sure if it will work with carpeted floors? It seems that it would only work on hard wood floors, so it has something to brace itself on? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!"
1,"Return it already,","It is not easy for a small girl like me to use.I hurt my finger while trying to adjust it, so I returned it right away."
1,Man kicked in my door,"A man kicked in my door and this thing caved like a 80 year old that had been gut punched. It might work to keep your three year old from coming into your bedroom without knocking, but from what I've seen of this, I'm not even sure of that."
1,the metal clip inside broke,the metal clip within the bar that allows height adjustments broke when I tried to open a door that was secured by the bar. I'm gonna try and salvage the bar by going to Home Depot store and see if I can drill a hole all the way through the bar and place a bolt and nut in the bar to hold it in that position and to give it more strength....I would not recommend this product since it broke so easily with little effort...The product is also made in China...like everything else
1,Broken within 5 sec,As I unpacked this item and slipped from my hand and fell on the hardwood floor and broke. This is suppose to withstand someone pushing on a door. Not much faith here.
2,False sense of security,"I bought this item because I am a stay at home mom with a hand disability. We live in a rental apartment and I am very scared to have people break into my home while my husband is off truck driving. First off, it is very sturdy ""looking"" but my 1 year old son was able to dislodge it from the door with little effort. My husband was also able to ""break into"" the door after losing his key to the garage by simple pushing the door back and forth twice to dislodge the device. It is good if you are paraoid but know that it doesn't really help prevent a break in, but it will buy a few seconds and alarm me to an intruder."
5,Safer with the Bar,"Great tool to help secure your space. Bar will fit in luggage to take with you on trips to secure your hotel room. I am very pleased with this purchase and will be ordering a couple more as gifts for family members that travel. Excellent for home security, installs easy, removes easy, provides a added sense of comfort to know you are more secure while you sleep."
3,mixed,"feels very strong on my basement door, but a little weak on my back door.There could be a hight difference. came very fast,very easy to use."
5,Love it,I hve several Master Locks already and I wanted more. I couldn't find them in my area but I found what I needed by using Amazon stores. This product arrived really fast. I would buy from this retailer again.
5,"Great Product, Great Price","Wish I had bought more than one. This entry locking mechanism is easy to use and blocks doors well--tried to get in with it in place and couldn't. No drilling, installing of locks, etc. Can use on exterior door or interior doors. Definitely helped with peace of mind."
2,Slips on collared doorknobs-slides on smooth tile,"This is a great idea , in general.But buyer please note that for interior doorknobs that have a slanted collar, the device's ""doorknob end"" does not fit tightly. It slips about 1"", until it reaches the door, and allows the intruder to open the door about that 1"" amount.Second, the ""floor foot"" slips on our entry tiles, which are standard gloss white 12"" tiles. The ""foot"" slips about 1.5 inches until it ""catches"".With these two slippages, the door opens about 1.5-2 inches, not secure enough for me. Buyers should be sure to try opening their doors from the outside, not just from the inside. From the inside, this seems to work well.Too bad. I was looking forward to using this, but I feel it gives me a false sense of security."
1,Security for the home,This master lock was poorly designed and made. It was too short for a sliding glass door and did not work on front door because of very poor design and construction.
1,Great if all you need the the illusion of safety...,"I tested this product as soon as it arrived, I have tile floor and heavyduty solid wood door, the device was disabled (it broke) after just merely pushing on the door. The steel notch mechanism to adjust height is the products biggest weakness. This product is going back to amazon."
1,Not happy,"So far, I am not happy with this product. It arrived seemingly well-packaged, but the yoke was broken off the bar. I will try a replacement, so maybe my review will become more favorable the second time around."
1,Item was made cheaply,"I purchased this item, and upon arrival, the master Lock bar was broken on the top and the bottom. It is made of plastic on each end, that was cracked. I attempted to repair it so that I could have some use of it, but it was made with such inferior material, that I felt that it would probably not secure a main door enough. In order to put the mechanism in the locked position, there is a silver pin that goes through a hole. The base of the bar is made of metal. I would recommend to others, based on my purchase, and my attempt to use the bar, that I would not get another one."
4,Satisfied with the product.,The product is good considering the price. It does give me the filling of security at night. I may order 2 more.
4,Security bar,"I have a daughter who lives by her self. She feels alot more secure with the security bar up against the door. (at night)I tried pushing against the door with the bar in place, it seems to work well. I like to keep the bottom at the minimum distance from the door (15""), it bites the floor better that way."
4,It does what is meant to do,"No complaints here, great product. From it's swivel base at the bottom, the strong frame and adjustable pin, to the plastic hook on top. Just adjust the bottom so that it sits about 12"" from the door and give it a slight kick towards the door and you can feel a bit safer. Even works on my rug flooring!."
1,Not worth it,It is not very often that product with good rating turns out to be useless.Purchased 2 couple of days ago.The rubber footing slides on a kitchen tile so much that you can open the door from outside in 10 seconds. Not satisfied at all. It works a little better on the carpet but does not leave strong impression.
4,Great Security for the Price,"Definitely a good buy. I use it for my front door, and it doesn't slip or budge an inch when someone tries to open the door. I feel much more secure since I live alone in an apartment. I've recommended it to friends and family who are pleased with their purchase as well."
2,"Not secure, base slides on tile floor","Updated Jan 09: I ignored the instructions and moved the base in much closer to the bottom of the door - about half the minimum recommended distance. Now it seems to hold securely. Not sure how it would work with a determined burglar kicking the door though.Previous review:I'm surprised at all the good reviews for this product. The base of ours slides on tile, even when kicked in tight. Door will open when jiggled repeatedly. Not sure I would recommend this product."
4,does the job,i use this on a sliding door simply to keep my young child from sneaking wondering outside out of my presnce- works great
4,Extra bit of security,"Got this for my girlfriends crib.. She lives by herself in a small apartment in new york city. This is a lightweight bar that doesnt require any tools or special skills, just slip i under the door knob and give it a couple of taps at the base with your foot. It wont completely stop someone who is super motivated to get in, but will definitely buy an extra 2 or 3 minutes to arm yourself with something, call 911 and escape out of a window. Would buy again."
4,Master Lock,This item does prevent the door from a forced opening from the outside . . . however there are rugs located at some of the doors entrances and the rugs all have to be moved in order for the bar to grip.
1,Keeps falling down!,"The peg that is supposed to stay in the hole to keep it propped against door isnt long enough and the whole thing just falls down. We are going to rig it ourself eventually by inserting a pin that goes all the way thru and then it will probably work. Just be warned, as is, it doesnt work."
4,It Does What I Need,"I gave this four stars instead of five, because although it does what I need, it's not perfect. It is certainly not a substitute for a triple-bolted steel door. And I agree with another reviewer that if someone really, really wants to get in, they will.Both my doors are of heavy construction and dead-bolted. I wanted a second line of defense in case the would-be intruder defeated the dead bolt. This unit does it. What I'm hoping for is, now faced with another line of defense, the guy will just go away, since he has no way of knowing if there's also a third line.Can this unit be broken by brute force? Probably so - I don't know. But I do know that in the process, he's going to have to make an awful lot of noise.In short, this unit isn't a total solution in and of itself. But's an inexpensive additional line of defense. After I tested my first unit, I immediately ordered a second one for the other door."
2,only works on tiled floors--and not too well,"We purchased a LOT of these, in order to protect our many exterior doors. We tested them out on every door, and both myself and my husband were able to push through the doors with these on every door but the one with a tiled floor--and even that didn't seem like it would hold up to much more force. I had really high hopes for this product, so needless to say, I am extremely disappointed. I weigh 120 and I was able to push through this thing--it is pretty much worthless. The problem is that the button that holds the bar at different heights is too short and flimsy--when pushed against, the button goes in and the bar collapses. The foot is also not large even to provide enough surface area to evenly support the weight an intruder will place on it. I would use this in a hotel room as back up (although I'd feel just as safe with a chair), but I'm looking for something else for my home--unfortunately."
4,works good,"easy to set up, use on the kitchen rear door and basement door. i wish the base that connects to floor had a better grip. didn't test it by kicking it. assuming it works.No break ins yet."
4,It works great!,"Last Friday night at 3:00am 'someone' was attempting to get into my apartment, and got frustrated and banged on the door to the point that it woke me up. But they did NOT get in! So I am very happy with my purchase. I was unaware of a product like this, but it was recommended by one of my FB friends - I am so glad she did."
5,Stopped attempted home invasion,"This security bar saved my life. It stopped what could have been a home invasion at 4 in the morning. The bar was able to delay the burglar enough that he would have had to have made a lot more noise to get in. So, he took off. When the Police arrived the officer told me he had the same security bar for his front door. I would highly recommend this security bar.When I first got this bar in the mail I thought oh this doesn't look like it's going to stand up to much but it proved otherwise. It is totally worth the money."
4,Decent Cheap Door Security,"With all the hype about bump keys (which basically renders most locks useless), I tried to think of something that can counter it. So far, this is the only thing that I can find short of buying a top of the line lock for a $80 - $200.[Pro]It's moderately effective with a low price.It's lightweight and portable. You can bring it on trips.It's versatile (it's adjustable and can be used on any door that swings inward and sliding doors)This will slow down potential intruders, potentially either buying you precious extra time or alerting you.You can use it as a makeshift bat if needed.It has better quality than similar competitors.[Cons]It only slows down a potential intruder. It won't stop them. This device is common enough for them to think of ways of countering it.The top piece that hooks into the door knob is made of cheap plastic. It will eventually break. Check it often."
4,"Little big, but does the job","This bracket ended up being a little thicker than I expected, but it still does a great job of keeping my sliding glass door snugly closed. I know it works because there have been a few times I forgot it's there and went to open the door - with no success! It's adjustable as well, so it should fit any size door."
3,Not happy,The first 3 months it was perfect- but then they both broke at the base and were useless.I will have to find another option
4,So far so good,"I have no idea and hopefully will never find out how well it works during burglary, but so far it is sturdy, doesnt let us open the door from outside. My doors already have deadbolts and iron fences so the bar just gives a little extra protection."
1,Disappointed,"This Carousel arrived and it is beautiful but the power adapter was broken - wouldn`t work. So I scrounged around for another adapter that did work. But then I cannot run that Christmas decoration - one adapter and two World`s fairrides. So disappointed to spend all that money and have it arrive with a defective adapter. Aren`t they tested before shipping?Sold by Amazon Export Sales, Inc. (Amazon.com)"
2,Won't work after one year-can't get serviced,"We purchased this to use in a Christmas train garden. It worked OK. We packed it in its' original box and stored in a closet. This year it lights, the swings move in and out, and the music plays, but it will not spin. The trouble shooting guide says turn off and on. No help. Mr Christmas web site gives no option for repair outside 90 day warranty. Rather expensive for a one time use."
3,Very cute,"Purchased two, one as a gift, one for my house. Within 20 hours the spinning operation stopped. Returned for poor quality. Hope the gift I gave lasts."
1,"Looks nice, shame it came DOA","We were given one of these last Christmas. We didn't have a chance to set it up last year. So it's been packed in it's original box since then. I just now unpacked it. The foam around the wires is tricky to remove (but does a good job protecting them). The directions say to remove the foam and power it up. I did. I can hear the music and the swing arms go in and out, but the platform doesn't spin. I can hear it making a faint click.But since it's a 90 day warranty (for something this expensive?) I suppose I'm out of luck."
1,Never Worked Properly; good luck getting ahold of Mr. Christmas!,We have another Mr. Christmas item & my kids love it (skating rink). We decided to add to our collection & get this swing carousel for $119.00. When it arrived it didn't work properly. I wanted to replace it but Amazon was out of them a week or so after I ordered this (2nd week of December). Now that I see several others have had similar qaulity issues with this product I will not bother to replace it. It's too bad Mr. Christmas cannot make these products to a higher standard given there price!
5,Nice item,"This is a great swing carousel. It appears very delicate, but is actually very sturdy. My only less than perfect comment is my duaghter wanted to people to move. We have another carousel by the manufacturer and she can move the people around. But all in all it is a great item."
4,Great read,"Excellent resource for anyone deciding if this is the right career path for them. Opens up the possibilities, and provides details about the pro's and con's of each role discussed."
1,Lame. Don't buy it.,"This book contains simple-minded advice and information that is common knowledge and therefore not useful at all, even to children contemplating a career in mathematics. Definitely not for serious minded adults."
5,Rugged case!,"Nice rugged case, worth the money. Far better than the Chinese crap it replaced, this index is going to last a long time."
2,"Where did ""Charms"" come from? This is the film ""Hex"".","This oddball film from the early 70's has Keith Carradine, Gary Busey & Scott Glenn as 3 post-WW1 biker-types that run afoul of townies in a small burg in Nebraska and end up hiding out on the farm of two odd sisters, both of whom seem rather witchy. Their father was Indian, apparently, and taught them lots of things, like how to gather and smoke loco-weed, which their new friends rather like, actually. This has some odd and spooky elements to it which are unfortunately overshadowed by an innate goofiness that keeps creeping into the film at all the wrong times, and that includes the kazoo/vaudeville/jaw harp music that will leave you wanting to rip your hair out. In short, I don't think this film knows exactly what it wanted to be, therefore I really wasn't sure what to make of it. 2 out of 10, had potential but squandered it."
1,wrong game,got package.title of cd case is ultra pinball thrillride. the actual disc say pinball madness 3. wrong games.. i'm pissed off.. and we already installed it and are having problems with it. what a rip off.i just ate it bigtime on this purchase. to the seller i say... a factory sealed game with wrong disc in it.. highly unlikely.. but a repack is most probable.
1,Grating on the nerves,"I purchased several items in order to begin to learn German. I found this product to be the most annoying. The software is archaic and difficult to navigate. Also, the method of teaching employed involves total immersion in German, with no accompanying translations of the words being taught. However, the software does offer several ways to practice the vocabulary for each lesson, with spoken and written exercises. In combination with other books and audio CDs, these exercises were a little helpful, but overall I gained the least knowledge from this product."
2,I EXPECTED SOME MORE,"This method seems to be a little one. It only has 1 CD rom and NO WORKBOOK, just another methods."
1,I gave it a 1 because there is no zero.,"Its worthless, utterly worthless. My father was born in Germany, and speaks the language fluently, having lived there 26 years. He watched me use this software and told me it is not going to teach anyone German. Don't waste your money on this software."
3,Could have been a better resource if vocab were limited,"I have been using this to supplement my way through Wheelock's, which throws a lot of verb conjugations, tenses and voices at the student over just a few chapters. I needed more verb practice. This could have been an excellent product, however, the fact that the drills use hundreds of different verbs greatly diminishes the value to a student who needs to focus on patterns in order to recall the paradigms. A good 70% of the verbs were unknown to me, so having to constantly flip back to the index to look up the conjugation and principal parts made it more difficult to concentrate on learning the endings. I learned more writing out my own drills on paper than using this book. There are at least a couple errors I caught in the answer key. It is better than two stars so I gave it three, but be prepared to either have to memorize a huge bank of verbs or to be flipping back and forth in the book."
3,satisfied and relieved ! !,"Nice design, easy to handle good for all areas of the body. Used it on my foot for fallen arch and neck muscles .The tip does not vibrate as I would have liked but am still satisfied with the performance and relieve the tension. Price was about as much as I would pay for this product. Not sure how long batteries will last depending on useage and speed of vibration. I'm happy, thanks."
4,Wrong color,"I ordered white to match the paint on my walls and I got black. Too complicated to return. Cable works fine, though."
2,"Uh,","I was disappointed with this movie. It is okay, but effects are cheesy, (note, I am speaking from the point of a 10 year old) I mean the ending is lame! I didn't listen to these reviews, but I should have!"
5,Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie,"One of the best anime movies I have ever seen. Great animation, great story, great action, great voices, and great music. All Sonic fans, anime fans, and people who like good movies should buy this."
4,Sonic Movie,"I recently bought this video and it was good.It wasn't as good as the comic books. If you like anime this is a good starter. Also if you are into Sonic the Hedgehog its good. If you're a hard core Sonic fan like me you will find a lot of things different between this movie and the comic books. Such as the fact that Sonic and Knuckles are best friends. Everyone that reads the comics know that Sonic and Knuckles are on speaking terms at best. Anyway it was good in my book. The only real thing that annoyed me were the dubbed voices. They sounded stupid. If you buy this you will like it. It is very fast paced though, so follow along."
3,"It was okay, but not great","Pros:1. The music is great2. It's pretty funny3. The battle scenes were really goodCons:1. The voices are HORRIBLE!2. The artwork could've been better3. It needed a better storyline4. Sara, the person that they have to save is an indrecibly annoying idiot, and it's a wonder why Sonic didn't just throw her off a cliff~~~~~~~Well, here's a brief description. Eggman threatens to kidnap Sara, the presidents daughter if Sonic doesn't save ""the land of Darkness"" from this reactor blowing up. So Sonic goes to ""the land of Darkness"", and it turns out to be a trap, and so, Sonic has to fight ""Hyper Metal Sonic"". It's basically like the video game - Run around. Blow up robots. Yay. It's good for a game, but not for a movie. I wouldn't really reccomend this, unless you're a kid. (I think it was just made for kids, so pre-teens, teenagers and adults think it's a waste of time)"
4,Sonic's back in this movie and better than ever!,"Sonic vs. Hyper Metal Sonic. The president and his daughter kidnapped. The two worlds will blow up at any time. Metal Robotnick. These are only a few things in this movie. Robotnick gets Sonic to come to the presidental house with Tails, where he's holding the president and his daughter (Sarah) hostage). He tells Sonic a generator that he built will destroy the land of the free and land of the darkness. He says he was kicked out by Metal Robotnick or else he'd stop the machine. Sonic and Tails decide to go stop the machine. They meet up with Knuckels and destroy an enemy. I won't say who, I don't want to spoil the movie. Anyway. Sonic ends up being cloned, by getting all of his data taken and put into a robot... Hyper Metal Sonic. Sonic now must beat the evil robot, stop Robotnick, and stop the evil machine. This is a great movie, I just don't like the voices, but you should buy it."
4,A Pretty Good Movie,"I like this movie though the voices could have been much better. Tails' voice could have been much better. Sonic's voice isn't as bad, though it's not the best it could be. Amy doesn't make an appearance, Sara seems to make up for her. I think the movie would have been better had they replaced the voices and Sara. Sara gets really annoying because of her whining and high-pitched complaints. Don't count on many video game similarities. Even Knuckles has a problem. Most of us know him as the stubborn guardian of the Master Emerald. In this movie though, he seems to have plenty of free time on his hands. He doesn't have that stubborn, I'm going to do things my way attitude. Listen to the end credits song "" Look a likes"" See if you can make out the words. Trust me, it's difficult to. Even though all of these cons listed may stop you from buying it, this movie was a good one, especially if you're just being introduced."
3,Awesome?,"I love this movie since I was a little kid and am trying to get things that help me relive my childhood (in a sense). The only problem about this movie is that it's so expensive. Why is that, is it out of print and in little quantity. The last time I talked about this movie is when I was a kid and all my friends and other people who played the sonic games said this movie sucked and IMDB gave it a less than average review,but I didn't care. So why is it so expensive! Other besides that, love the movie, strongly recommend it."
5,A brilliant anime adaptation of the series.,"In Japan, this was a two part ova series. Dic changed it into one feature though, so it's a movie.I'm unsure if all copies are like mine, I bought mine around 1999, and it's uncut. However, I recommend this movie.It's light hearted near the beginning, but becomes increasingly dark. It might confuse some Sonic fans, especially new ones, but I still recommend it.The dubbing is pretty good. It's, obviously, more similar to the original 90s voices, rather then the Sonic X voices, but the voices for this movie are not from any other Sonic movie or game. Tails sounds like he has a cold, but you'll grow on him."
4,About this movie :),"This movie had everything a slightly weird-but-funny comedy needs: A crazy guy, explosions, super glue, and hats. Knuckles's expression was so funny when that robot blew up in his face! The only bad part was the voices. I almost choked when I heard Knuckles's voice!I reccomend this movie for ages 7+ or else they won't understand half of the movie."
2,sara the sayan,"how could they not put sally acorn in this movie.if all the smart people noticed sara,they must have saw her tail (whitch is the tail of a sayan from the show dragon ball z) <LONG LIVE PRINCE SONIC AND PRINCES SALLY ACORN,MAY THEIR KIND HEARTS BEE WED FOR ALL ETERNITY> L.N.S 777"
2,Okay...,"It's not anime. I can tell you that. It represents more of Kid's WB or FOX Family than something from Japan. It's not that bad, don't get me wrong, but it needs better dubbing...by far. Tails kinda sounds like a Rugrat, and Knuckles sound too hick. The story line is...bad. The end battle is great, having Knuckles and Tails take turns flirting with the Presidents daughter, but the action scenes need help. Sonic appears to need help more than Tails does, and Knuckles does lots of fighing. It's reccommended for Elementary aged kids, but pre-teens may find it childish. However it goes, anyone who likes Sonic the Hedgehog video games or the animated series will find it somewhat entertaining."
4,This Movie is GREAT!!,"I saw the movie and it's great! I saw it over & over! I would've given it 5 stars but the only thing that was ""cough"" sorry about it was the voices!! Sonic & Tais sounded like they had a cold but, the other voices were good and the storyline is great! And it is definently for all Sonic fans!!Some advise though is to get the DVD version."
3,Don't they make movies like this?,The movie was good it just that why don't they make other Sonic the hedgehog movies like this.Maybe they make them at Japan I don't know but hopefully they make another Sonic movie.Once I went to Coasco with my mom and I saw Sonic mega collection.So we bought it and I went to extras and there was something called Sonic CD and it looked like a movie!I thought wow there was another Sonic movie but then I went to my friend's aparment and he had the game that came out Sonic gems collection and the horrible truth was it was a game!A freaken game!!Damn and I always thought it was a movie!!I wish they would make more Sonic movies!
4,(Gasp)Thats bad!,"I absolutely despised the voiceovers, I thought someone has secretly replaced Sara with C-Ko Kotobuki before the movie, and the lines were awful ( (Fakey gasp)THATS BAD!). ADV also screwed the character's personalities from ANY Sonic video game, comic, or TV show. KNUCKLES IS NOT SONIC'S BEST FRIEND! FOR MOST OF THE SERIES THEY HATED EACH OTHER'S GUTS! But even so, it was still fun to watch and lots of fun to riff."
3,Not quite what I had in mind.,This movie was not what I expected but entertaining none-the-less. The voice acting for Sonic and Tails was so bad that I had to switch the audio to Japanese and turn on the English subtitles (DVD version). The animation was really close to the kiddy version of the TV cartoon but it was still within the feel of the game so I won't complain too much about it.
2,FAFU'S REVIEW,"i was very hyped out to seeing this movie, and have been waiting a long time for it to come out, and it was also by the makers of tekken and i thought that this movie would be totally great. So when i watched it, it started off great like a very serious action movie, but then after the main title, everything just seems to fall apart, it could have been really great, but they really picked the wrong animators and writers for this. if it was by the same people that did the darker saturday show, it would have been very good, but instead it was like the eraly mourning kiddy one which i'm not to fond of, so after wathcing it, i was dissapointed completely."
1,this movie sucked,i have seen many sonic cartoons over the years and this movie was the worst. the animation was crappy and the character voices cracked. over all it was a bad movie i wouldnt recamend it at all
2,sorry!!!,"sorry about my little brother who calls himself ""sonic killer"",but don't worry, he's grounded for 2 weeks and he can't go to this website ever again.(He's been using my screen name,don't worry he only wrote reviews for this,i wrote everthing else!!)I don't like sonic but hey everybody has their own opinon!!see ya!!(read my other reviews,kingdom hearts,final fantasy x,tekken tag,and tekken4!)sincerly,kenny"
1,DON'T BUY ANY SONIC STUFF!!!!!!!!!!!,"ok sonic sucks don't buy anthing related to it!!buy kingdom hearts or final fantasy instead of this movie with a hunk of junk robot in it!!I repeat:SONIC SUCKS!!!!!!sincerly(NOT),Sonic Killer!!!"
2,Oh the pain,"an interesting idea for an anime, but not a good follow through. I think that best sums up this piece of DVD. Watching it in Both english and japanese, I came to one conclusion. ... even for a show based on a video game.Sonic, Knuckles, and everyone else's voices sounded like they spent the day in a william shatner reading studio, after breathing heluim for six hours.The plot: An interesting idea, with a few minor twists, but it just never seemed to get going, and before you know it, the show was over. Plus it was hard to note just how evil Robotnick (Eggman) was supposed to be. He had a love interest with the presidents daughter, despite the fact she hated him, and at times he appeared quiet comical. It seemed that everyone had trouble staying in character.The only reason I give it two stars, is that the battles between Metal Sonic and Sonic were decent, and the parts where it was meatn to be funny were. but as I said I wasn't ever sure if the anime was trying to be serious, or goofy."
5,one darn g%d movie!,"man this movie is the best....i love how its funny, and up to speed like the video games are, but it seems to be directed at older kids, around 12 or 13, so being a 'tween' i caught some things....like sara calling metal sonic a 'pervert'...its alot to explain...but anyway, it wuz fun and made me go rent it agin and again. highly recommended!!!"
5,Best PDA ever,I use Xircom's wireless ethernet module to access the net with Palmscape and Blazer. Very cool. Can your palm do that?
4,Regret not buying a pocket PC...,"So why did I give it four stars, you ask? Good question. The short answer is that Handspring shouldn't be held responsible for Palm's lacking OS. When I see my friends with their PocketPCs running Autocad and other REAL software, I admit to more than a tinge of envy.Since I have always been one to use the heck out of my computers, I expected the same when I bought my Visor Prism, but the OS is really holding it back.This is all the more of an unforgiveable shame because Palm had a three year head start. Microsoft made two very bad pocket operating systems, and Palm sat back arrogantly and laughed at their efforts (does any of this sound familiar, Apple?) But as usual, Microsoft kept trying, got it right, and is now blowing the doors off their competition. Maybe Palm will invoke the help of the Justice Department to help us poor consumers."
3,Shocking-- beware static electricity!,"I love my Prism and I miss it now it is being repaired. I touched it and the shock of static electricity that was transmitted at the time caused it to short circuit. I had to send it back for repairs. I lost all my photos because I was never able to back-up the eyemodule2 photos I had taken over the holidays. Still, I look forward to having it back, working out the kinks in HotSync, and making it work for me. Also, I recommend you get the extended warranty-- if you drop the handheld and the screen shatters you get one free replacement."
2,If a screen displays in color and nobody can see it.........,"I have been a Handspring customer for the past 2-3 years and have loved the device. I recently cracked my screen and decided it was time to upgrade to the color device. After one week of use and constantly having to strain to see the screen under normal office lighting, not being able to see it in sunlight at all; and finding its only real improvement over the black and white models to be an improved version of Solitaire and Klondike-I returned it. I have another 8Mb Visor, in black and white, on its way.Unless you're truly intending to use this device as a digital photo album, which in conjunction witht the digital camera is a pretty cool feature, or doing serious wireless surfing, I wouldn't reccomend spending the extra dollars. The typical user who relies on their Visor for calendar/contact management will hate the difficulty seeing the color screen."
3,Good But Not Great,I have had my Prism for 2 weeks now. It is a nice unit and does most of what I want it to do. I do have a few gripes though: (1) It could use a flip top cover. The existing cover must be removed and set down some place. Also my wife put the cover on upside down and broke loose the bottom sync connections. This should not happen. (2) The battery life is pretty short. It is a lot shorter then any standard non-color PDA. I need to charge my Prism every other day. I wonder if it would last for all day use. (3) The Graphiti is marginally accurate. Maybe I need more practice but I doubt it. I find it easier to use the keyboard option. (4) It is bulky. Now for the things I like. (1) I like the 8M expansion card. (2) I like all the different software available. (3) I like the address book and email ability. I know there will be more to like as time goes on.
4,Best screen in the Palm OS,"Recently I decided I ""needed"" (yeah, right, heheh) a PDA with a color screen. I liked the Prism but got talked into the Palm M505, against my better judgement.I tried the 505 for 3 days and found the screen to be unacceptable, even with the backlight on all the time. My partner, who has an older Palm V, couldn't even tell the screen was in color.So I took it back and exchanged it for the Visor Prism, which I love. Best screen in the Palm OS world. We're an all-Mac house, so I have to use Palm OS.I would give the Prism a 10 if it lost a quarter inch or so off its thickness, but what the heck--as I discovered the hard way, function is better than form."
4,Good PDA with some flaws,"I had a Palm for years and recently switched to the Visor Prism because of positive reviews on the color device. I am a designer and I care about how these units look. All visor including the Visor Edge are no comparison to Palm devices. Palm V is beautiful but I was disappointed by Palm customer support and the high price.Visor Prism does have a screen flickering problem but it goes away in a week. I guess it is either I got used to it or the screen has been ""warmed up"". The color is great and many software enhancements work better with color. Although I didn't think much of the Springboard idea, it makes upgrade so much easier. It transforms your pda into a new device. I have the digital camera and the Visor phone. All work great.One more thing about the screen is although it is crisp, you can see each pixel. The B&W pda's look sharper than the color ones but it is still impressive and great to look at color."
5,I Miss my Visor Prism!!,"I replaced my Prism with a Palm M515 and I miss my Visor!! If I knew then how difficult it would be to replace I would have purchased several more, kept a nice inventory and and made a profit on the rest. Handspring made a VERY nice color PDA.....I hope PalmOne stays with it..."
1,don't count on it,"I have now been through two of these, I might be silly but I expect to get more than a year and a half out of my investment. Customer service stinks and is a rip off. Both Prisims are garbage for numerous reasons, not batteries, they were changed. If you want something that will last awhile don't get it. And I don't have any other software on there except Datebook."
3,Compare with sony before buying,"I purchased it two months ago. After seeing all the PDA's in the market, I found Visor Prism a good buy. I am using it with magellan GPS unit. This works great. Prism with GPS unit catches satellites fast. I found Handspring is having lot of spring board modules available in the market. But the fact is each module is very expensive. Also handspring can use only one module at a time. I was disappointed due to the limitation of memory. Though there are spring board modules available in the market, I can't use it while I am using GPS. This is serious limitation. I would sujjest to consider SONY PDA's before buying this. Even though sony PDA's are expensive they come with memory expansion slot, MP3 and bundled software.Handspring should plan on selling springboard modules at a reasonable price."
2,Skeptical & Cautiously Optimistic,"Like Decemberrain, I had problems with my Prism right out of the box. Charged the battery the recommended interval. Setup routine was as far as I could get -- unit went black every time I removed the stylus from the case. Put it back on the cradle, it powered up on its own, into the setup routine again. At one point, the backlight stayed on with no screen display, and the unit locked up. Repeated soft resets finally restored the Prism to what I hope is normal operation. If it keeps working, I'll gladly keep it. Nice color display, screen very readable. I hope I only need to come back for more purchases, not a replacement Prism!"
1,Screen hangs and freezes,"Bought this Prism a week ago.... Screen hangs and freezes, and the whole unit could not be reset for several days. Tech support is NOT toll free. I like the screen brightness and color, but I wish I'd bought the M505, and may still return it."
5,Throw away your gargantuan laptop,"Buy a Handspring Visor Prism and toss your big clunky laptop away. Purchase the OmniSky module, and the fold up keyboard and presto, you've downsized your laptop. What more do you need?"
3,"So, what DO you do when the battery wears out?","This is a nice device. All of Handspring's machines are nice. But I kept looking and looking for a place to get the replacement battery pack for when the rechargeable battery pack wears out. You know - not IF it wears out, but WHEN it wears out. Never had a battery-operated device where the battery didn't wear out eventually. I finally found one mention of it under ""repair and replacement"" on the handspring.com website. Wanna know what it says? Pack that puppy up and mail it back to handspring to get new batteries. How sad. When I finally was forced to the conclusion that the batteries were the most important consideration in my buying decision, (more than, say, functionality!) I chose a Neo. I hope someone from Handspring is listening."
4,3 years with my Prisim,"I have had my Prisim for 3 years now, The hard shell cover has allowed me to carry, (and sit on )it for all of the 3 years. The 8 meg is plenty for normal use.It is in use every day, and backedup/charged just as frequently.I know there are more advanced units out there, with more features and such, but I dred the day I will need to find a replacement that can measure up to this one when it is gone.I never leave home without it for sure!"
2,Flimsy construction. M100 is better,Ok. The color gets 4 out of 5. The unit plastics seem flimsy. I will be buying a palm m130 soon. I said a while back that is was a good desktop away from home.. well it it is if you hold the thing like a 100 year old person.Enough said
5,handspring prism a okay,"I purchased this Handspring Prism so i was able to store my contacts. It not only stored all of my contacts (approx 325) but also let me sync with my computer for emails as well. This prism takes the place of my smartphones ( one got wet, one was dropped and the third was given to my granddaughter). I love the color and the ease of putting info into the unit. This unit may be old school but still very functional in todays world."
1,Out of Commission,"Got it as a gift on the 1st of Jan, broke down on the 7th after spending a total of 4 hrs on the unit. Retuned the product, and was simply told to expect this."
2,don't get this it's too bulky,"I wouldn't get this PDA b/c the springboard modules are really ""infinitely expandable"" promises. Show me a decent springboard module you can plug into this. To date, the idea of expanding your PDA is great, but the modules haven't lived up to the promise. The Blackberry does a way better job of receiving wireless E-mail. Other MP3 players are better than any springboard mp3 player. The list goes on. That said, you're better off getting a different color PDA. Although the 65,000 colors is great, no one is going to get to look at great pictures on such a tiny screen. Also this PDA is big and clunky. While that may not be an issue for you now, it will be in the future. Over time, you want things to get smaller not bigger. The modules you can get are expensive and they don't really offer a whole lot. Plus when you outgrow the module it doesn't expand. Great idea, but poor execution."
2,Buy the Sony Clie,"I bought the Prism because of the color screen. Unfortunately, the resolution is so low that it hurts my eyes to look at the screen. The Sony Clie has the best screen on the market.The Prism has 8 MB of memory, which gets eaten up pretty fast, especially if you subscribe to AvantGo and Vindigo.It is also much larger and heavier than most PDAs. However, that could be a plus for people who lose things easily ;-)The first Prism I bought was defective; it would not charge. I will say that I was able to have it replaced easily.The best part about the Handspring Visors is their Springboard modules. You can make the PDA into a cell phone, an MP3 player, hook it up to a modem...obviously all of this comes at a great additional expense.According to what I have heard, Handspring is really focusing on their Treo combination cell phone/PDA...that may be the Handspring product to watch."
1,"Can't upgrade OS, color screen is pixellated","This Handspring has 8MB, but no flash-ROM. The flash ROM is what allows you to upgrade the Palm operating system on the device.This is a major oversight in design in the rush to market. What good will this PDA be in 3 years when nothing is compatible anymore because your OS is outdated?Another major drawback, in my opinion, is the color screen. It's lousy. There's this funky grid that overlays the screen and makes things look pixellated. Once you see it you'll notice the grid every time you look at the device. Gives me a headache.The worst thing about the whole Prism is that it doesn't work with my machine. I've got a USB and I just can't get it to work and the manufacturer won't take it back. I'm really stuck with this thing and loathe it the longer it sits here.The technical support didn't fix the problem and kept referring me to someone else who never called me back. So if you like wasting your money, go ahead."
1,Worse than Palm M100,"Where should I start........ Oh yes, Let me start on the color. The color, when the bacckround in a app is white, the white has a pinkish hue. The durability of the Prism is auful. I dropped it one in a padded case by mistake, and the screen breaks. (Handspring's technical service is 10x worse than palm's)Screen cracks are not not covered in warrenty. The price to have it fixed is US$135.00 (EUR 137.50) palm covers screen cracks in warrenty. The battery life, handspring, says is two weeks, well I can't get the battery to last for a whole High School Day. If I was you I would look at the Sony Clie T615c, Palm M505 or the palm IIIC"
5,The best,"I finally made the leap and purchased this product. It is awesome and I use it all the time. Love USB compatibility, so much color, and all features that it comes with which includes some games! However, I was sad that it did not come with an ebook reader and spent two days at palms site finding it. Should come with one. However, overall all, this is a wonderful product!"
1,AWFUL,"This is the most awfully written book I've read. Unfortunately, this happens to be ""the bible"" (!!?!??) in dental anatomy.It's boring, and the illustrations aren't clear and do not correspond well to the text.The author should be killed twice.Very unfortunately it is the main text in our dental anatomy course."
1,Worst!,"I ordered the product last 12 Apr 09, it is now May 13 09 and I have not received the products yet. Now tell me, isn't it worst to wait for something that you already paid for and not even see the product or heard from the merchant?"
1,The cheaper edicion is horrible,"I bought theWheeler's Dental Anatomy, Physiology and Occlusion thinking that I was buying a pretty new edicion of a book with a CD and color pictures. What I recieved at home was an old book with horrible black and white pictures and an awful redaction. I don't know how newest edition is, but I am shure that this old one is almost not a text book."
5,Exceptional!,Besant is so gifted in enlightening one on the spiritual path! This book of essays will inspire you when you need a lift and comfort you when you are in despair. She simply is incomparable in her ability to shed light on life and the divine.
2,ok,"This product doesn't taste any different than the one you can buy at the grocery store. Not better; not worse, just more expensive."
2,"Excellent research, flawed conclusions","Irving, as usual, did an excellent job in researching this book; however, his conclusions are about as flawed as those he drew in HITLER'S WAR, when he concluded that Adolf Hitler did not know about the Holocaust until 1943 at the earliest. I do not recommend this book who is not throughly familiar with World War II and does not understand that Irving's conclusions must be taken with a grain of salt."
5,Great Chicagoland Mystery-Thriller,"This is a fast moving, quick read. I enjoyed the story and yet the author did not get too technical when legal issues were involved. Fun reading and enjoyable. Leaves one wondering where the relationship between the two key players - the lawyer and the detective - will go. Provided great insight into the Cook County Court and Detention system while keeping one interested in the characters as opposed to the environment in which they operated. Good Read. I look forward to more from EG Schrader - possibly more of Janna and her detective."
2,Felt Like a Kangaroo,"I felt like a kangaroo jumping around from character to character and from event to event. It was difficult to follow this book and I found myself almost ""relieved"" to get to the end of it. The characters could have been fewer and better developed while accomplishing the same storyline. However, to be fair, my spouse read it and thought it was great, so......"
4,A book i thoroughly enjoyed,"If i had 1 complaint about this book it would be the far too numerous minor charecters in this book that got in teh way of each other. Other then that, i thought the book was very interesting. This book was definitely a page turner as i finished this book in less then a day. I do enjoy the female lead, a defense attorney, however i wonder if her charecter in future books will go back to the DA's office as it seems she has a heart and mind being a prosecutor.Needless to say i'm looking forward to her next book.Also good to see the setting be based in chicago. =)"
1,The worst mystery I ever read,"This was a horrible legal ""mystery"" and I don't know how or why others rated it so highly! The reader knows who the killer is from page one, and what the subplots are and how they will evolve. The so-called red herrings are transparent.There are God- knows-how- many-loose ends. The protagonist could have been from any profession-- she did not have to be an attorney since she does almost no court work, there is no trial and she does not even have the sense to make sure her client gives her a release for psychiatric information.She doesn't even guess the killer --the solution is handed to her and her erstwhile boyfriend,the detective. The characters, from the detectives and lawyers to the killer, are barely one-dimensional. A total waste of time."
5,A Buried Jewel,"As an American, it took me a bit to get used to the language of rural Ireland in the 1920's, but this film draws you into a world that seems not at all foreign after a while. Unlike the relentlessly depressing ""The Field"", this is a drama of real tragedies - the small, silly tragedies that we create and that are created for us- and also, of real hope. The original Irish title of this film ""How Harry Became a Tree"" is so much more fitting than the US ""Bitter Harvest"" (what were they thinking?), though fortunately the brilliant allegory of the tree is not lost with the title change. Performances are universally outstanding and poignant, the photography beautiful, the music haunting. See this film and see how the Irish continue to astonish with their mastery of language and vision."
4,Interesting and engaging,I bought this movie because of Cillian Murphy. That's not why i like it though. Colm Meaney was extraordinary in this movie. The things he does to get back at his enemy is comical at times. The scenes with Cillian are funny to watch because of his character and his relationship with his wife. The ending though is a sad one. The movie is enjoyable.
2,Not for the layman,"Luckily I picked this book up at the library, or else I would have been severely disappointed. This book is NOT for the layman, at least for this layman. The pastiches of Sherlock Holmes and Professor Challenger are wonderful, and written exactly in the style of Arthur Conan Doyle. BUT, the physics is too complicated for someone who has had no physics or math in a number of years. Way too complicated."
5,Best watch bought ever,"This watch is very nice looking and convenient as well.Quality is super and nice.Date is a bit annoying for some, but live with it..."
4,Quality Prog,"This is actually an Australian progressive rock band! I didn't know that there were any! It's a pretty good effort. I think what makes it special I suppose is that they are basically in the traditional progressive rock sound but their sound is different in that the songs are based around melodic guitar solo's. There's an almost tropical feel to the beautiful 'Rosanna' and lead guitarist (also main songwriter/singer) Mario Millo is a superb guitarist. They have a spaced-out sound, sort of like Genesis around 'Wind and Wuthering' and are less into a rocking sound and more into easy listening instrumental solo's. It's a pleasant record, nice to listen to, roughly 4/5."
2,Drip Drip,"Mid-70's guitar rock that thinks it's Progressive (only three songs; lots of mellotron; lots of long instrumental passages). The compositions are neither particularly engaging nor imaginatively performed. If you like early Camel, fine. It's like that, without Peter Bardens or Andy Latimer. Or Doug Ward. Or Andy Ferguson. Only worse."
5,Mimi Hines Sings Her Face Off,"At last, Mimi Hines' two vocal albums from the mid-1960s are available on CD. After listening to this, you'll wonder why there were only two albums. ""The Music That Makes Me Dance,"" which she sang in ""Funny Girl"" after she replaced Barbra Streisand, is a standout, as well as ""Nothing Can Stop Me Now"" and ""Till There Was You. And ""Pink Taffeta Sample Size 10,"" a song cut from ""Sweet Charity"" is touching and a standout performance. Thank you to whoever made these albums available again."
3,A specialist taste,"There is plenty of fascinating stuff in this book.- One of the earliest fights in the ongoing battle against the ""Big Sewer"" in small town America.- A chronicle of a place and time, Bolinas, California, in the '70's, that ""lived a life worthy of a biographer"".- The Portrait of the Artist/Journalist/Food Activist/Planner/Architect/Activist as a Young Man/Woman. Watch lots of people interact, who went on to become locally/regionally/internationally important, when they were young and burned brightly.It's also kind of a rambling mess to readers 30 years later, particular if you don't have a pre-existing knowledge or interest in any of these subjects ;-(And it's also deserving of a follow-up, for in the process of ""saving itself"", Bolinas set the stage for it's destruction as the ""outlaw area"" it once was. Building permits on the coastal plateau are essentially impossible to obtain, and the law of supply and demand ... you get the picture."
1,DO NOT BUY,"After years of checking my blood pressure with an old Panasonic and Sears models, I decide to use a wrist model for convience. This wrist monitor is a useless item that will not work for you. It is very difficult to get an accurate reading at the wrist unless you are lucky enough to place it just right. I have since dumped the monitor in the trash and believe this type monitor should not be even sold. I bought an Omron 10 series arm monitor that works great. Please don't waste your money on any wrist blood pressure monitor. Good Luck!"
3,Blood pressure machine.,"We chose this LifeSource Blood Pressure machine because of the recomendation from Consumer Report magazine. The Unit took a little getting used to as it did not register the correct pressure at the beginning. However, after we found the best position on the wrist we are satisfied with it.The price at amazon.com was the best anywhere. We saved about $30.00 from the next lowest price and nearly $80.00 from the recommended retail. All in all, I feel we got good value for our money."
2,Irregular Readings,"I have high blood pressure and I need to monitor it daily. With all the mixed reviews it was tough to decide on which one to buy. The LifeSource UB-512 was recommended by a friend who has one. It seemed to be as accurate as my doctor's, but after a few days with it. I noticed the readings were too inconsistent from reading to reading all within a minute of each other. I returned it to my friend and purchased the number one recommended unit out there, The Omron HEM-650, I give it 5 stars for accuracy and the Advanced Positioning System it uses. I get consistent readings each time."
2,Reads too high.,Exchanging for third unit. Previous units read 15 points too high compared to Dr's and drug store readings. Very sensitive to position relative to heart. All other features as advertised.
5,Blood pressure monitor by Life Source,"We are most pleased with our blood pressure monitor. It is accurate and so easy to use. I purchased this item at Amazon, and I am delighted with it. It came on time, and was packaged well."
5,Wrist blood pressure monitor,Similar to a monitor used in my doctor's office and appears to be accurate. Can't use an upper arm sleeve because of awkwardness and pain and this is a perfect solution.
4,Pure pleasure listening to Connie Francis sing en Español,"I love to listen to Connie Francis sing en Español. I prefer the songs that were originally written in Spanish, as opposed to Spanish versions of American tunes. Nonetheless, I'm glad to have this in my collection. I've only given it four stars because I also have (and prefer) Vintage Music No. 157 - LP: Connie Francis, La Paloma en Español. There is a lot of overlap between the two albums, so if you only want to purchase one, I'd give a stronger recommendation to the latter, probably because it has La Paloma, one of my dearest melodies. I'm just an old, romantic sentamentalist, so don't be too swayed by me."
1,A Disgusting Depiction of Violence,"I've read other stories in the series and enjoyed them, but this one truly goes beytond the bounds. Edge is trying to find the Mexican bandits who robbed him and as usual runs into an assortment of characters in his quest. Along the way, he meets a pair of bounty hunters and their woman. Edge's treatment of the woman must be one of the most disgustingly degrading portrayals outside of S&M pornography. It ruins an otherwise exciting Western. The review system appears to not allow 0 stars, so 1 is given grudgingly."
2,Nice bag...except the shoulder strap. Failed after 1 month of use.,"I really liked this bag, but the shoulder strap has a cheap plastic connection which broke after a month of use. If you plan on using the shoulder strap, I'd pass on this bag."
4,Not Bad,"i keep hearing people say Macross II is bad but to me if your're looking for something good to buy ,then buy this because it sure is better then Ghost in the shell and Ninja scroll .And all my friend who watch Macross II agree it is good like mad . So if i were you i'll buy it ,you won't regret it."
4,Macross 2,"Macross 2 is one of the best animes ever made, it is second only to Macross Plus. The animation is beautiful and it is one of those animes that you can watch over and over. If you don't really watch many animes but have seen and liked ones such as Akira or the Neon Genesis Evangelion series, I suggest that you buy this one."
4,It's not bad at all,"I have seen this. Put aside all that talk that this is not a true sequel to Macross. It really doesn't matter. This is entertaining. On its own, this a pretty good piece of anime. I certainly liked it. I even want to watch it again.I am even thinking it's a little better than the Macross Plus 4 part series, because the plot, though very similar to the original Macross series, is a lot better.Rent it, buy it...just try it... the fast paced action you are looking for is still there..."
2,macross 2 the movie,this movie blows! i wasted my money on this one. i watched it and the whole plot just sucks. why would i watch a movie where the main weapon is a song. Do not waste your time with this one.
2,Dissapointing,"Let's get one thing straight, Macross II is NOT a true sequel to Macross. Why? Because Shoji Kawamore and Studio NUE (the creators of Macross) were not involved in this project (unlike Macross Plus). The story is about a purehearted young man, Hibiki, who meets (and falls in love) with an alien singer, Ishtar. The two try to stop an alien invasion with the help of a tough, attractive military woman, Silvy (which starts a love triangle). They find out that Ishtar's songs has the power to confuse the enemy. Sound familiar Macross fans, it should, because it is almost the same plot of the original Macross. But it does'nt come close the paragon of storytelling that Macross was. The animation was OK, but the dubbing was terrible. I would have rated this VHS higher if it did'nt have the name Macross written all over it. Very dissapointing."
2,Very slow and boring for extended periods of time.,"The plot is overused. It's another ""guy meets important alien girl who thinks are customs are strange"" movie. It doesn't start off bad, but after the first battle and maybe another 10 mins, it became extremely boring. The movie just drones on from one slow, boring scene to the next. If you are going to watch it, just fast forward to the siege of Earth at the end, which isn't even that great."
2,"Mech are great, plot isn't there","The mechanical and space craft designs are great. Unfortunately the plot is a total turn off. A reporter jumps into a fighter jet, then becomes a ace pilot? You tell me ! The japanese can do better than that! They did, in Macross and Macross Plus..............."
2,Incomplete Product,"I bought this for nostalgic reasons, only to find out that I bought half of a movie. Chapter 1 through 4 are present (at least in the digital/kindle version). 5 and 6 are missing completely. Very disappointing. If and when the complete video is posted, it will be around 2 hours and 40 minutes."
2,Macross II streaming,I want to point out that the streaming video version up on Amazon is missing a little over an hour of video. It isn't supposed to end after 92 minutes. The total actual length is 160 minutes. Given two stars because of the missing video.
3,Could of been sooo much better!,"I just rented Macross 2 last night, what a stinker. I have to give it credit for good animation but the plot was horrible. Make sure you do not add this title to your anime collection!"
2,Mediocre Macross,"In all fairness, people should know Macross II was made during a period where the Japanese Animation industry was in a bit of a slump. Titles produced during this period saw a marked drop in animation quality coupled with so-so scripts. Macross II's storyline simply followed the Macross formula--a love triangle, clash of cultures, and space battles. Macross Plus is also more or less cliched in this regard. However whereas Macross Plus has spectacular animation which makes forgiving its tired plot extremely easy, Macross II is saddled with laughably inconsistent animation quality, and hence has virtually no redeeming value. (Sidenote: for the OVA version of Macross II, only two episodes--4 and 5, can boast decent animation) Perhaps, if this were made just a couple of years later, it would have been better received..."
4,Macross II Movie Review,"Macross ][ is great. In every sense it follows the Macross template to a T. Fast paced, intesne action, and a good plot. It even shows the effects of Zentraedi/Human culture and genetic mixing. The only flaw I can point out is that it does not follow the Macross storyline with advanced colonization (as M Plus and M7 does), still a great movie as a atand-alone; even if it's not part of the official Macross story. Very fitting of the legacy!"
2,Bad sequel,"How bad is Macross II?Well, I had the Macross II tape, I sold it off after three or four viewings. As a comparison, I have Macross Plus: The Movie Edition, watched it more than 50 times, I can still feel the ""magic!""The plot for Macross II is confusing and incoherent, to say the least. To be fair, at least Macross II looks okay for the 1st hour or so in several battle scenes, but frizzle off miserably at the end.Avoid Macross II at all costs. Buy Macross Plus instead."
2,will they fit?,"These rotors were the wrong diameter for my 2002 Hyundai Santa Fe. The diameter was too small so the rotors don't cover the entire brake pad!! Yes, these rotors do fit on the vehicle, and they do stop the vehicle, but they are NOT the right rotors. 1/3 of my front brake pads don't even touch the rotors."
4,New Believers NLT Bible Personal size,Size is convenient but the size requires the font size to be very small. Makes it hard for old eyes to read. Also the text is crowded on each page toward the binding. This makes you force the book open to see the words closest to the binding. NLT text is an easy to read and understand edition. I gave this bible to my 25 year old son and his girl friend took it from him for herself. The NLT translation is ideal for the young people of today.
3,Type too small,"When I received this book, it was even smaller than that posted on the site. The type is tiny and difficult to read. Other than that its pretty good."
2,Inaccurate Product Condition,"The book was sent quickly; however, the condition was listed as new. The book that was sent was clearly used. After contacting the seller they asked for the book to be returned before they would issue a new one. Having already been sent a book in the wrong condition I did not think I should have to return the book before they made amends."
5,Stupid name; fantastic novel.,"I actually bought this book when I took a trip to Penang, Malaysia. That's where it takes place. The story chronicles the life of a Malaysian born Chinese girl. It begins with her carefree childhood before the Japanese invaded and destroyed many lives. The saga takes us through her wartime adolescence as well as trials and tribulations of her adulthood. We experience her tremedous personal growth and character building. This novel also gives us a glimpse into diaspora Chinese women during WWII."
1,Piece of junk,"I bought this based upon the decent reviews and low price.However I plugged it in and it worked great...for 3.5 minutes, then if flickered and went out and hasnt worked since. If you need a computer light I would spend more $ and get a good one."
1,"There must be a use for this item, but I haven't found it.","If you want a weak spot of light the size of a silver dollar, then this is the light for you. Otherwise, I'm not sure what this item is good for. I wanted to light my keyboard, and liked the sleekness and smallness of this unit, but it really isn't functional. I will need something with a larger light."
1,"Not worth the price uou pay for it,","This light didn't last a month, in fact it broke when my wife turned it on, the head fell off. Well to be blunt don't wast any money on this light!!!!"
4,Good video,"This is a great video for people to start with and it even gives lower impact options to people with bad knees, such as myself! I need to get back to it though and am planning on doing so now with a new home theater system. Worth the money."
4,Quick and Effective,"As a former aerobic instructor/fitness trainer with 15 years experience, I am a tough critic of exercise videos. This one is great. If you only have about 30 mins. and don't want to settle on the intensity of your work out, this delivers! I own several Firm videos and this is one in my collection. It is among the best of the Firm videos out there. It does help to have a knowledge of Step aerobic commands, but as another reviewer stated, just stay with it because it is worth it. I would not recommend this for a beginner as without any knowlege of step aerobics you might get frustrated with this efficent video.Intermediates and above will appreciate the choreography, intensity and efficiency."
1,Out of date Print Cartriges,Odered HP 11 Print cartridges in Nov 2011 for 1700 inkjet. It would not take out dated cartridges. These were out dated by 2 years covered up by a barcode. I Have pictures that I sent to Amazon.com. Very disapointed since I got these to do my Grahdson's Graduation Announcements for the end of May. I have one hundred announcement to do in a short time. Not good business practices.
1,if it only worked . . .,"If it only dispensed ink I would give this product a great review. Unfortunately this ink cartridge does not dispense ink. My printer won't work at all unless there is a cartridge inserted in each of the four ports, so I'm stuck without yellow output. I've tried HP help lines and their web site to no avail. My suggestion to you is, if you have an alternative to this product, try that one first."
4,Beautiful,"I loved this album once I'd warmed to Andrea Marcovicci's mature, slightly worn voice. She manages to infuse songs with a tender nostalgia, leaving out melodrama and vocal pyrotechnics. My favorite songs in the album are ""Sunday in New York"" and ""I Walk A Little Faster""; Marcovicci sings them lovingly and hopefully, but still manages to imply that she's seen alot and lived alot."
4,an outstanding book but somewhat outdated,"This book is the most comprehensive book of cell biology I have ever read. I think it is still better than Lodish's Molecular Cell Biology, even the 4th edition of the latter is updated. It helped me greatly in my preparation for GRE Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology Test (I received a score of 750, 98%). However, 7 years have passed since this edition and many progresses in cell biology have been made in these years and a new edition is needed. It is said on Medscape Bookstore that the 4th edition of Molecular Biology of the Cell is due to be published in 2002-04 and now I am waiting for it."
3,Has the Basics.,"For a college level course, this book is decent. The figures are comprehensive and the verbal explanations effectively explain the main points. However, I'm not keen on the organization of the book. Some topics seem to be unnecessarily divided into distant sections, and that arrangement makes it difficult to study one topic completely in one sequence. On closer inspection, it seems to be matter of teaching style by the authors; different lessons on the same topic are divided to match another overall theme or lesson flow. Either way, the information is there even if it feels like you have to hunt for it."
5,This is the most fundamental book in the biological sciences,We are having an on-line class about genebank and alignment softwares and surfing on net we reached this page. Molecular Biology of the Cell should be the reference book for undergraduate students of all biological fields.
3,A very comprehensive though unfortunatly not current book.,"This edition (3rd) came out in early 1995 and I think was really written in 1993. (See inside cover for copyright info).As we all know much knowledge has acumulated since then and many techniques have either changed or become more advanced. It is still an excelant cellular level biology textbook but I think a new edition is in order. Alberts, are you out there!? ;-)"
2,what you want is the fourth edition,"I'm sure this book was great in the 90s, but this is the 21st century, when you can buy the fourth edition. There has been a ton of advancement between 1994 and 2002."
5,Extremely well done textbook,"This book is the bible of cell biology. I continually find it to be well written, very thorough and extremely well illustrated. I am a PhD student in physiology and would consider this book to be one of the most indispensible books in my library. In fact, this is one of the few books I will pull off the shelf, open to some random page and just read."
5,The only molecular biology desk reference you will ever need,"As a research biologist, Cell is the best quick reference. Easy to understand tables and graphics, and with the Hyper Cell computer software the text comes to life. A must for any Doctor, Phd, or arm chair scientist"
5,MBOC 3rd Ed. is wonderful!,"I am an undergraduate biology major. I don't usually waxthis enthusiastic over a textbook, but this one held myinterest like no other text. Call me strange, but I justcouldn't put it down! I found I couldn't take it to work toread during down time, because I'd become oblivious to mysurroundings.That said, this is not the book to start with if you justwant to learn a little about biology. It does presume acertain base of knowledge."
4,[....],"The Alberts text is the definitive resource for anyone interested in the subject. It is also useful for people who's parents coerced them into majoring in biochemistry. The details are plentiful and well-explained. The diagrams are clear and generally easy to understand. In the end, the mark of a truly exceptional textbook is how dumb you feel upon having read it. Based on this, Bruce Alberts has co-authored arguably the finest molecular cell biology ever produced in that it made me realize exactly how dim I really am. [....]"
2,not what was advertized,"Recieved the dvd in a timely manner however, the cover is not the one advertized was well used although ther dvd is fine."
2,Found much better...,"Altho in another Gilbert & Sullivan operetta review, I urged finding D'Orly Carte performances, I failed to add that when this can't be found, the ""Opera Australia"" versions are VERY good, and staged in imaginative style. ""The Goldoliers"" is the very best done by Opera Australia, on DVD with the Kultur label. Excellent! (So skip this version)."
4,A Delight,"As a long time fan of Gilbert and Sullivan I have enjoyed many good productions and suffered through many a painful one. This series is wildly erratic in its quality, but The Gondoliers is one of the good ones. My acid test -- I showed it to my 15 year old niece and her three 16 year old friends -- all of them really enjoyed it. So did I! It is greatly enhanced by the libretto -- which unfortunately was not included in the box. I brought out one from another resource and when referenced and some historical issues were addressed my niece couldn't wait to see another. Very enjoyable addition to any collection, for watching or just listening."
5,this was a very good version of this musical,"I recently saw this musical on bravo and loved every minute,Iwould like somebody to confer that this version was made in canada."
1,Disapointing,"Your editorial review is correct but understates the technical problem with the sound in this whole series. The excess reverberation, poor audio production, and the English accents make this almost indecipherable by North Americans. I get the feeling that the director is very visually oriented, but he tries to get cute and technical. The trick shots are just too contrived. The cast does not seem to be having any fun, the hallmark of a good G&S performance. They are not sharing the joke because they are so pre occupied with their technique.I far prefer the series done at Stratford in Canada rather than this candidate for Madame Tusaud's museum."
2,Terrible preformance of an excellent operetta--try Stratford,"I never believed that Gilbert and Sullivan could be rendered unfunny, but this cardboard production manages to produce the impossible. they have turned one of the funniest, most dynamic plays to a static yawn. The singing on a whole is pretty good, but the sound quality and acting are terrible. I'd say go for the Stratford production: while the voices may not be quite as good (and for many of the singers are)--the Canadian production is far better at catching the sparkle and playfulness of this play."
5,"Expected Less, Got More",I was pleasantly surprised that the directing and acting of this series work was worthwhile. Recommended - even to the die hard Gilbert & Sullivan fanatics.
3,Short fill,I love the bedding but didn't work out to be 50L.. Better off for me to buy the smaller packages.
5,Much more effective than CareFresh,"Very little product smell, effectively controls the odor in my mouse's cage, very little dust, inexpensive = very happy w/ this (so is Mousie) :)"
5,"Highy recoomened, lots of variety, has nutrition info","I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to make delicious, easy to make meals without a lot of time & effort. Recipes include desserts, soups, vegetables & main meals. It is printed in blue ink with a few full-page color photos.The book starts out with menu suggestions & crockery basics. Great tips for thickening sauces, browning & enhancing presentation are also included.Conveniently, recipes are then arranged by cooking time from less than 6 hours to more than 10. I love that there are tips to lower fat content & that nutritional information is included for each recipe.There is a lot of variety here including traditional favorites like beef stew & chicken soup as well as international delights such as tamale pie & Thai pork. There are also great dishes for entertaining such as bread pudding & Italian roll-ups."
2,Crockery for the Elitist,"Perhaps my title is a little strong, however I feel this book was designed for cooks proud of using the crock-pot for specialized meals. The recipes call for ingredients not on every grocery store shelf. This book is great if prize winning crock meals are something you want to tout @ mealtime. If I wanted to be boastful about my meals, I wouldn't be using a crock-pot! I wanted a cookbook for easy, quick, ordinary crock meals. I am searching to find a crock cookbook without the pomp and circumstance, one that is common, traditional, everyday. I would endorse this book if fancy crock cooking were your desire. It is terrific for that purpose."
4,Great book!!!! Necessary for anyone with a croc-pot!!!!,"As a single man that works hard, i found that a slow cooker is a great way to have good meals. This book is a MUST for anyone that uses a croc-pot."
5,illuminatus 4.0 is a simple step forward,"I have been using Illuminatus since version 2.0 and grown to like it very much. While there are gigantic products like Macromedia Attain and Asymetrix Tool Book. It would take a year to learn how to use them, with the Illuminatus the learning curve is short while the list of features is pretty big. Downolad a demo and give it a spin. There is a version 4.5 available."
2,rather disapointing,"This collection would be fun if all the games could be played head to head online, but they can't. The pool game is fun but you are much better off buying Sierra's Maximum Pool instead."
4,toy morphy,I liki this product- just wish it has sound to add. Looks like a real iron & the kids love that.
2,Missing Pages?,"I ordered this book for My English history class, and I was happy at first. I really like the stuff in this book that we had to read for class, and it gave me a new found appreciation for English history. Then when I got to page 274, the next page was 307! The pages weren't ripped out or anything, they are just not there... I had to write an essay on the passages in these missing pages too. Now I don't know if I will be able to finish my paper on time and I'm very upset. This isn't amazon's fault or anything, and I do like what I have read from the book, but these missing pages are making me rethink about ordering part two of the book without seeing it in person first."
3,History Book,"I had to buy this for my history class. It was not as bad as I thought it was going to be. Articles are short and to the point, so it's useful for my british history class."
2,Terrible Tech Support,"I bought this to utilize optical out to my receiver in order to eliminate hiss and noise that comes from using an analog port inside the computer.TECH SUPPORT is useless! Works with my notebook, but does not work with a brand new Dell Dimension 4700 Tower; phone support would not help me because I have had this more than 2 months, and email support said that they do not ""support 3rd party hardware""; that is pretty lame when the ""hardware"" is a brand new dell computer.The product does work for my purpose, and I don't have any problem with Bass output (as long as my computer volume is not on max and I use my receiver to control it); however I suspect that any other (cheaper) USB sound device with an optical out would do the exact same for me.The product is expensive for what you get. The remote that comes with it is also very lame!"
2,Allright until it ceases to work just after the warranty expires,"The sound quality seemed pretty good, it has lots of functions and decent software,plus digital outputs. Most of it is pretty unnecessary though, especially if you have a dvd player, i have a cheap one Apex-$40 which sounds as good if not better on the same speakers. As for recording, i only have a bad computer mike so its probably its fault. As another review will tell, this card seems to have a tendency of ceasing to function completely at for me 15 months of use. Search other options or risk an okay soundcard with a 7.5 month half-life----skip it."
2,Sound Blaster NX,"This sound card did a pretty good job of playing music on our Sony Vaio. It was definitely better than what the computer came with, but after a year and a half, the sound card is dead. Won't power on at all, and we have changed the USB cable, and the power adapter. I have as of yet, heard back from Creative Labs, but I don't expect much to be truthful, because it's off warranty. (1 year) I will probably end up replacing it, but not with another Creative sound card."
2,Full Duplex,For the price it would be nice if USB Audigy 2 NX were full duplex for major electronics items input devices of more expensive models. Sounds Polish real good and in other local dialects. No joke.
1,Disappointing,"This product is very disappointing. The graphics are poor. Words are used which are not usual (""diga"" to answer the phone) and are not even contained in their own dictionary. Why not just say hello? (""Hola"") Dictionary does not pronounce the words so a book would be MORE useful, not less, than this software. The simplest things are repeated over and over, and then they throw something new in without a clue as to what it means."
3,Correction,"I would just like to correct something in the review written by Margeret Berger... She said words that were hardly used in real life were used in this program, such as ""diga"" or answer the phone. Why not use ""hola""? Because in about 90% of spanish speaking countries they *do* use the term ""diga"". It means ""tell me"" and is much more common than ""Hello"". It makes more sense too."
3,Not a grammar error,"As a correction, I will briefly say that ""diga"" is the correct way to answer the telephone. In fact, ""diga"" is in the dictionary, but it is a conjugate of the word ""decir,"" meaning to speak. Just like ""does"" may not appear in our dictionary because it comes from ""do"". Please do not hold this against the program, because they are correct. However, it may lack in explaining the pertinent information on why one word is used instead of another."
3,Peels Off On Its Own After Six Months,I love the look of this sticker but I've already been through one and the second one I used is starting to peel off now too after about 6 months of use.
4,Sleepy Eyes Of Death - Sword Of Satan,"Sleepy Eyes Of Death - Sword Of Satan - Probably one of the best films in the series, Kyoshiro is begged by several strangers to save the life of a virgin saint. He reluctantly agrees and encounters several who wish to stop him at sword point. He expertly dispatches them with his masterful bladework before he finally meets up with the saintly one. But this is just where the plot really gets good. Kyoshiro's past and origins are finally revealed and the climactic moments are truly memorable. As with the other Sleepy Eyes films, this one is presented in widescreen format with great subtitling and color. Acting is great, with Nemuri Kyoshiro probably at his darkest. Great sword fighting and one on one duels. This film is one of the reasons that this series has been referred to as the most popular samurai film series in Japan - and that's saying a lot with competition like the Lone Wolf and Cub series and Zatoichi."
4,Very good,This is the second film in this series that I have purchased. The first one was Full Circle Killing. I enjoyed this film as well as the first one. A great story and plot with some excellent martial arts action with the sword. Kyoshiro is a great character and you certainly don't want to be on his bad side. Excellent film work and subtitles as well. If you like Samurai movies check these films out.
5,Great socks,They felt good. Look good. And cost a lot less than comparable names in stores overstock stores.
3,Extreme Cat-Lover Seeks New Addition For Pickled Head Collection...,"A sophisticated international playboy named Hugo spends his days flying around in his helicopter, looking for beautiful women to take home. Home for Hugo is an ancient monastary, complete w/ bald, Tor Johnson-like servant Dorgo, a trophy room full of pickled human heads, and a pit of 1000 (give or take) ferocious house-felines. Once there, Hugo seduces, kills, and grinds his girlfriends into kitty-chow. At only 63 minutes, NIGHT OF 1000 CATS zips along, even w/ WAY too much padding in the form of seemingly endless helicopter flights. However, it is pretty funny to see Hugo hovering 6"" above a prospective victim's swimming pool! Very subtle! Macabre and goofy, NO1KC is another wacky 70s relic..."
1,Totally Disappointing,"This film goes nowhere. There is no blood, no nudity, no weirdness...absolutely nothing that describes this as a 70s horror film. There ishardly any dialogue and great part of the film are just shots of ahelicopter and bad seventys instrumental music. The few girls in thefilm are beautiful, but considering that it was a horror film and itwas the 70s, there should have been more skin shown, at least tojustify for the poor story line and bad acting.This film is nowhere close to any other 70s horror gems. Another factorthat disappointed me was that the movie is all spoken in English. Sincethe title is La Noche de los Mil Gatos, I thought it was going to bespoken in Spanish, so that took away my interest since the beginning.I do not recommend to serious horror film buffs."
1,Beware it is a single,"I purchased this CD for 11.99 not realizing that it was a single. It may have been labeled, but at that price who would think it was a single. It is now selling for about 1/3 of that price which is much more reasonable. Unfortunately, I didn't realize this until after I opened it. It was very disappointing to say the least."
4,"Adds ""power"" to your train table!","If you get in on sale (e.g. 40% or so off), it's a good buy & a nice addition to your wooden train set. Between loading the coal, unloading it, generating power (pushing the smokestack which spins a ""power"" wheel & lights up 5 little lights), there's a few nice interactive things for your little one to play with (none of which require batteries!).Also comes with a coal car & two loads... which is nice. What's also nice is that there isn't a track attached to it... which makes it much easier to work into your layout.I've knocked a star off just because relative to some other Thomas & Brio items, it seems a little pricey for what you get - and doesn't seem to be as ""high quality"" as some of the Brio stuff or even other (older?) Thomas items.In general though, the kid likes it (& so do I!). So a good product / buy!"
5,Celestial,"I love this cd ! I Bought it weeks ago and I love it. My fave songs are Tal Val Despues, Ser O Parecer , Dame, Sorpresa (Rebels Sample).Heres my RBD CD'sCelestialRBD Fan Pack - i kept the buttons and shirt, i gave the cds to other peopleRebelsLive In HollywoodRebeldeTour GeneracionNuestro Amorheres all my cdsTHAT I LISTEN TO*CELESTIAL - RBD*LIVE IN HOLLYWOOD - RBD*REBELS - RBD*TOUR GENERACION - RBD*REBELDE - RBD*NUESTRO AMOR - RBD*HANNAH MONTANA SOUNDTRACK - VARIOUS ARTISTS AND HANNAH MONTANA*CHEETAH GIRLS 2 SOUNDTRACK - CHEETAH GIRLS AND VARIOUS ARTISTS*UTOPIA - BELINDA*PRICE OF FAME - BOW WOW*THE ENCAPATION OF MIMI SPECIAL EDITION - MARIAH CAREY*THE EVOLUTION - CIARA"
4,the best cd of rbd...but different.,"I think that this is the best RBD album. Much more mature than the others. However, it is not pure, cheesy 'Im in love' pop like the others. There are some Latin ballads as well as electronic stuff thrown into it. It is much more depressing, real than the others. I like it the best, but it really depends what kind of RBD you like."
2,OK if you love harp music,Some of the selections don't really lend themselves to the harp. My daughter was not impressed with the sound. Make sure you really want harp music.
2,Could have been better,"I was so excited to receive this book and take a look of those mentionned 193 pictures.... although I am still a bit excited I have to say for those who might be interested in buying this book that the pictures have a really poor quality, the English translation is not accurate nor complete, and finally that this is a collection that encompasses different centuries but this did not give me a comprehensive idea about Russian silverworks."
5,Profound and loving,"As a professor of Muslim studies for years who has considerable experience interacting with Muslims, I found this book a must-read written by a man who clearly loves Muslims and is untainted by the fear and suspicion surrounding us today. This is not a mere historical introduction to Islam or a detailed analysis of Islamic beliefs; it is a wonderful weaving of personal stories with practical advice on reaching out to Muslims. Unlike some books, it does not try to identify ""weaknesses"" in Islam as a means to crush Muslims through polemics. I have assigned this book to my graduate students who praised it for its balanced tone affirming the truths of Christianity with a love for Muslims. If you are, or want, to interact with Muslims, do yourself and Muslims a favor and read this book. For another book that is a bit more academic but equally loving try Matthew Stone's bookReaching Muslims with Love and Logic: A Non-Model Model"
5,Enchanting Christmas Music,"I enjoy listening to this CD while decorating the tree and around the house at Christmas time. The sweet sounds of the classic carols set the right mood for stringing lights. I'm not a big fan of country music, but I do love mountain music with the banjo, dulcimer and mandolin. The instrumentals in this CD are easy to listen to and have an old fashioned charm."
5,Exactly What It Says,I live in the Smokies and this perfectly represents the heritage and sound of the people who settled here and many that live here still. This is a very well done CD with a nice balance of acoustical instruments native to this region. Beautiful.
5,"Great, laid back, instrumental Xmas","This is a great CD and it'd be a shame if it's out of print entirely. The sound of the instruments are warm and crisp, and really give the feeling of being snug and cozy by a fire in a cabin someplace. I get pretty sick of all these songs every year but this version just has that magical quality, feels just a bit more sophisticated."
5,Delightful Dulcimer Renditions of Christmas Tunes,"The cover might make you think it's just one more generic Christmas album with a folksy spin. Take a listen and you will hear genuine acoustic and very pleasant-to-the-ear versions of your favorite Christmas songs.Here's the scoop on the group from CDBaby: ""Cumberland Gap began taking shape in 1998 with Greg Silsby (vocals, guitar) and Aaron Muskopf (vocals, bass). Kevin Liley (vocals, banjo, mandolin, fiddle) joined the group in 2000 with the departure of guitarist Dave Anderson.Since the beginning Cumberland Gap has stayed true to its roots. Their acoustic renditions of classic American music and their inspired list of original songs have gained a steadily growing enthusiastic audience."""
4,Long time favorite,"I have enjoyed this christmas music for years. I had the tape and was so happy to find it on DVD too. Heartwarming, toe tapping, not your usual holiday listening."
4,Simple and effective,"Simple sturdy and well made. The inclusion of a ""skin"" to protect your iPod is nice. Seems a little pricey, but does a good job."
2,Freeze warning,"I bought the Speck iPod armband because of the sleek design. I didn't want a huge armband. However, the two times I used it, my iPod froze up after about 20 minutes. I contacted the company and she told me that the iPod is guaranteed not to skip for 20 minutes, but after that it's possible for it to skip or lock up. I guess my arm moves too much for the iPod in the armband to continue functioning. In theory, it's a great product, but unfortunately it didn't work for me. My guess is the iPod isn't designed to be worn/carried this way."
3,ANOTHER FREEZE WARNING,"The item itself is nice; however, it does cause the ipod to have problems with skipping and delays. I have had my ipod for approximately 4 months and after using this armband to exercise, I noticed that my ipod would begin playing a song and then in the middle it would skip to another song. It also made the ipod delay playing songs when I was not exercising. The song would appear on the screen but take quite a while to start playing or when I would try to go to the next song, it would take some time for the next song to even appear on the screen. When I went to have it fixed, I was told that it is better to get an ipod nano or ipod shuffle because they have a flash memory without moving parts like ipod 20gb, etc with hard drives. When you have the ipod on your arm and it is moving around such as when you are exercising, it causes the ipod to skip or have additional problems. I agree with the freeze warning listed below."
4,Big help for nervous kid,"It's really just a big bolt-on sissy bar like some older 70s bikes had. But it works really well for bike training. Our 6 year-old is fairly coordinated but a little nervous about getting hurt after a few spills. The nice thing about the bar is that you can hold it to keep them steady, and then lower it to give them a push if they're not big on pedaling. It will hold its place wherever you put it, but can be pulled up and down while in use. He went from being scared of riding to doing 2-3 minutes by himself in a few hours. We still have to give him a push to get started every once in a while but overall this thing has helped out tremendously."
3,Less Mulit-functional than I though,I was hoping this would work to train my son (6 years old) to ride without training wheels which it did- worked great. It worked so well we only needed it for one day. I had then planned to put it on my 3 year old's bike to help push her up hills since she is not a strong peddler but you cannot use this product with training wheels. Other similar products on the market attach to the seat so could be used to aid/push young riders then help transition older riders from training wheels. All-in-all good product but hard to justify one day of use.
3,"balance buddy decent, but could be designed better","The balance buddy is a fantastic idea, makes kids feel safe when learning to ride a bike, but is difficult to keep level and is slightly twisted. Overall, we are satisfied with this purchase."
5,Best thing ever!,I bought this after seeing a neighbor teach her son to ride with it. We never needed training wheels and my daughter learned to balance in less than an hour. I like the shape of the handle as it doesn't catch on things like trees and bushes as she goes by as some other handles look like they might. The simple design went right on the rear axle in seconds and is always at the right height for me to crab on if I need to assist- even with her baby brother on my hip! I have recommended it to everyone I see!
3,Requires some strength,"Great idea. I've tried it with my timid 5 year old who LOVES to lean to one side when riding.After about 10 minutes of trying to hold her up, my forearm is sore! That aside, my husband is able to use it with ease and our daughter is at least willing to TRY to ride her 2 wheeler."
4,Don't break your back,"I was trying to teach my 4 year old daughter and having hard time holding her. I was going to break my back and that's when my friend mentioned about something like this. So I read the reviews and bought this one. What a relief? It is very comfortable to teach bike riding and also gives confidence to my daughter that I can hold and stop her any time quickly. Other than that, learning quickly really depends on the kid and I don't see why this would help like many reviews pointed out."
5,Awsome Product!!!!,"I have tried just about every possible method to teach my son, now 8, to ride a bike. I tried raising the training wheels method, the 1 training wheel method, and the no training wheel method with me running beside and letting go and watching him fall again and again and again, etc.... No success. This weekend I put the Balance Buddy on his bike and with in 2 hours he is now riding his bike with no training wheels by himself. It was easier on me because I didn't have to hunch down to hold on to the bike and run beside him. It helped him learn the balance basics and he didn't get to see me let go of the handle and watch him ride by himself. The look on his face when I ran past him while he was riding the bike by himself was priceless. Great product!!!!"
5,Back Saver!,"Best invention EVER! Even if your little one picks it up after a session or two, this device is well worth it! No back aches from bending over a miniature bike holding onto the back of the seat! Simply genious!!!!!"
3,Interesting read,"This was one of the first books I read by Dorothy Garlock. It was an interesting book but not as good as many I have since read. The main male character, Slater, is not likeable. He has a very bad temper. At times the plot was confusing and I was not crazy about the subplot involving a ranch foreman.Since I gave this book three stars there must be something I found enjoyable about it. Overall the writing was very good and I enjoyed the ending which had a surprising twist.I have read almost all of Dorothy Garlock's other books since picking this one up and many are simply fantastic. I would encourage you to read this book but also look into other Garlock books."
4,"ENCORE UN COUP DE MAITRESSE, VIVE SALLY NYOLO","SALLY, TU fais un point d'honneur en sortant ce nouvel album. Je le trouve superbe, je n'ai pas encore deguste toute la galette musicale mais deja, je suis impressionne...Du courage et vivement que chacun ecoute l'album et donne son avis...A tous les melomanes, ZAIOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNEEEEE. hehehehhehe"
4,We like it,"We got one of these window thermometers as a gift many years ago. It has worked well, and still works well except that it does not stick to the window very well any more. So we ordered a new one from Amazon last month. The new one is performing well. It reads 1.5 degrees lower than the old one does. I think that the new one is more nearly correct. Our only complaint is that the (LCD) temperature cannot be seen at night."
4,rowdy crunk down south sh**,"This is some hard sh**. First time I heard concentration camp was on this cd and they off the hook. Lil Boosie tears it up he's bound to come up, peep Boosie's solo sh** also. If you like that rowdy south music similiar to old No Limit pick this up. Baton Rouge to the world ya heard"
2,ehh,"Being a fan of Seann William Scott and Billy Bob Thornton, I was hoping the best for this movie. Although it has a somewhat meaningful message I think it missed the mark. Not really funny, either."
2,Could Have Been Funny...But Isn't!,"The premise of this movie set up for what could have been a funny story. It never happens. I waited and watched for something funny to happen, nothing much did. There are a couple laughs, certainly not enough to warrant buying this dud. I rented it for $1.49. It was worth about 49 cents."
5,Best Comedy of 2007,"I was a little surprised when I saw that not too many people enjoyed this movie. From all the comedies that have been coming out the past few years, Mr. Woodcock has got to be the best yet. Why? It's not predictable and is truly hilarious throughout. So, don't listen to these other people, rent it, or even buy it. In my opinion, it was one of the best/funniest movies of 2007!"
1,Lousy,This movie is so lousy that I just wanted to quickly get to the end. It was a complete waste of time.
2,Ughh Could've been better,"i say now it could've been better , because well it could've better than it was . Mr Woodcock is a story of the gym teacher from hell that tortures poor kids in his class, hey nobody perfect. anyway i want to go and see it but never got a chance to until recently and let me tell you, i'm glad i didn't paid full price at the theater for this clunker i would've been tick off majorly. some of the lines were funny but only for a few laughs at that , Billy Bob Thornton try as he might could not save this film, it was definitely a turkey in the making. it needed an overhaul in terms of a rewrite done on the script to actually be funny. Sorry it wouldn't be worth your viewing time.you'd have more fun scrubbing dishes or toilet than going through a brain dumbing movie experience of watching this fodder.It's PG-13 For Language and Sexual Content."
1,there's just no purpose,"This is not the dumbest movie that I've ever seen. It is, however, the most useless. Nothing happens. It's not funny at all. The dumbest movie that I've seen is better than this b/c at least something happens. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!"
1,"Too Bad There Isn't a ""-"" Rating","This was a free rental, as I wouldn't have spent money on it. This thing was so bad that I felt ashamed of myself for watching it. All I could do was shake my head and laugh to myself that my standards, at least for this film, had sunk so low. I kept clicking the remote to see how much longer it had to go. I feel cheated.Billy Bob Thornton and Susan Sarandon should be ashamed for being in it. It had to be the paychecks.If you have the nerve to come on here and rate this film FIVE stars, then you are a simpleton. I am shocked that this is the kind of thing that the American movie going public finds entertaining, or quality. This, and torture porn. How sad, indeed."
1,Abysmal,"Sean William Scott, Billy Bob Thornton, and Susan Sarandon are capable, if not excellent, actors. In fact, I'm certain that if anyone with lesser Hollywood standing had been in this it would never have been made.Other than a couple of funny lines delivered by supporting actor Ethan Supplee, there was nothing to laugh at. It's ""Bad Santa"" Thornton watered down to the least, while everyone else on screen is wooden and bland, in a movie so predictable that I have a hard time believing it was even written.Here's the deal: Small town boy makes good, goes home for accolades, meets mothers new boyfriend, hates mothers new boyfriend, decides he's being selfish and works to get them back together.I don't recommend buying it, I don't recommend renting it. If you're bedridden when it comes on TBS at 8am and the batteries in your remote are dead, that should be your only excuse for watching it."
3,Funny movie,"I liked the movie and it came in nice package, but the movie for some reason kept freezing about 4 or 5 times I would have to rewind or ff it to get to move again. I am cleaned the disc off and I will try to watch again some time so hopefully it was just some dust or some thing on the disc but it was band new still sealed so I should not have had that problem."
2,Mr. Woodcock is no Bad Santa!,"Mr. Woodcock was quite a disappointment, considering the presence of Seann William Scott, Billy Bob Thornton, and Susan Sarandon, among others.A best-selling author returns home to pick up a prestigious local award only to find his mom dating his high school gym teacher that used to terrorize him and shatter his self esteem. Things quickly become more complicated when the hazing starts anew as the gym teacher picks up where he left off...In short, the acting is pretty good (though nothing great), while the plot and the dialogues are average and below average.Though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off, primarily due to the writers and the poor choice of lines and weak plot.In a nutshell, it's a mediocre movie and that's about it; no masterpiece here... 2.4 Stars"
4,Hilarious!!,Love this movie! Billy Bob does it again in playing a sarcastic jerk and being good at it!
2,BAD SANTA IN THE OFF SEASON!... MILDY ENTERTAINING!,"OK..this year's version of Billy Bob Thornton's ""Bad Santa"" persona is called 'Mr. Woodcock'! A couple of years ago it was 'School For Scoundrels', if you didn't like that film you probably won't like this film either. I found it to be mildly entertaining because Thornton plays this part so well! It's not a good movie, but if it's on cable, you might want to give it a look. It's a shame because they had a potential winner here and they blew it!...too bad :-("
1,Garbage,"The preview of the movie setup a great premise... but the actual movie goes nowhere.You expect there to be some kind of back and forth action between Thorton and Scott, but it never happens. It's a one track movie which generated 0 laughs while we were watching it.Don't waste your time, the other reviews on here are right on point."
2,Preview way better than the movie,"The script was bad. There were funny parts in this movie, few and far between, but for the most part I didn't find the characters to be funny or too natural. This movie had too many uptight and uncomfortable pauses in it. It was definitely not something that kept you interested the whole time. I also find that in better movies you can identify with the characters a lot better, which didn't happen here."
2,Let down a little bit,"I wish the build up wasnt wasted, I watched it twice to see if I missed anything, nope it was the same. I really was hopeing for a comeback to the young picked on kid, you wait and wait, and that is where the let down is. With the actors ablilites you know they can be a whole lot funnier so i blame the script for not letting them go a little more wild."
2,Look elsewhere for a great movie,"I was kind of disapointed with this movie, especially with the cast, I had high expectations. The movie felt like 2hrs of build up, but never built up to much."
3,it got a few laughs...,"I saw this movie at the drive-in and it's got a few good moments, like when the main character says that mr.woodcock is sleeping with his mom in the fast food joint, and Amy Pohler,who is ALWAYS funny! but there is no point realy to this in the end and Billy Bob Thorton is annoying in this,like most of the time, but not in a funny way. I say wait till it is on the cable one night to see it, but if you really want you can always rent it at some point."
2,just there,this film was just ok and never really got off the ground. it wasn't funny and if the star names hadn't been in it then it wouldn't get half of what it got. alot of cliche been there and down that type of gags and cheap shots and it never gets any one full message. Billy Bob thorton been playing the same role lately over and over. Susan Sarandon gets wasted on this forgettable film. dime a dozen film and very predictable.
4,Very Funny,"I watched this with a couple of friends and we all thought it was a very good comedy. Not hilarious, but well worth watching, and one of the funnier movies I have seen. The actors are great and the story entertaining.It deserves way higher ratings than the ones posted here."
1,Dont even bother,"This DVD was a complete waste of time, I didnt find it funny at all. We switched it off half way in."
3,Mr.woodcock,"Mr.woodcock is a comedy movie.The movie is about a high school gum teacher that makes high school students really bad.This movie is 87 minutes long.If people want to buy this movie,it is rated pg13 and can be bought for 14.99 at any store.The director Craig Gillespie he has also directed Lars and the Real Girl.Mr woodcocks is a funny movie that most people would like.Lindsay.E"
3,It's okay,"I give this movie 3 stars.The Blu-ray quality was not nearly as good as some I've seen, but it's not overwhelmingly disappointing either.The movie is kind of a dumb, run of the mill comedy, but most comedies are. I thought Thornton was excellent. He plays the cold, disinterested comedy characters perfectly. Scott also did a great job with his part. I think this is the first movie I've seen him in that I did not even think of him as Stiffler. He doesn't make any of the patented gestures and expressions that made him famous as Stiffler either, showing his talent as an actor by playing a more serious-minded character in this comedy.There are no real surprises here. The plot is just about what you would expect. If you've seen the trailers, you know what you're getting. It might make a better rental than a purchase."
5,CITY UNDER SIEGE,THIS CD IS THE BEST CD BY E.S.G.. I REALLY DO LIKE SHININ & GRIDIN TOO. IF YALL BOYZ AINT NEVER HEARD OF E.S.G. CHECK HIM OUT THE BOY IS TIGHT. DONT FORGET ABOUT MY BOY LIL KEKE TOO. HEY IF ANYBODY KNOWS HOW TO E-MAIL LIL KEKE OR ANY WRECKSHOP FAMILY MEMBERS PLEASE E-MAIL ME... I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT
4,The Beatles' Long & Winding Road,"As a hard-core, inveterate Beatles' fan, I loved this collection. It is true that the narrator has the enthusiasm of a dead horse, but don't let that stop you from enjoying this collection.Viewers will be treated to some bonus footage of the Beatles in newsclips and interviews. No songs are included in this collection. It is power-packed with information and, if you can overlook the tiring drone of the narrator you will certainly have much to cheer about this collection.For those who are determined to travel down the Long & Winding Road from start to finish (although you may want to watch this in installments), you will get a lot of good Beatle exposure and information as the boys shot to fame in Liverpool, to their famous August 29, 1966 swan song concert in San Francisco."
3,"Some gems, lots of filler","There are some really fine clips of Beatles antics and snips of interview materials that were new and interesting to me. Yet I found there to be far too many airport longshots of screaming teenaged fans, which after the fifth scene of screaming fans it becomes pretty dull!The ""documentary"" does an OK job of covering the early history, utilizing many chronological lists of things like singles releases and drug experimentation.......... I was left wishing that it dug deeper..... worth a watch, only purchase if you are a Beatles fanatic!"
3,A love/hate relationship to this product,Sometimes I like this product and sometimes it really makes me frustrated. I don't like the idea that you can't save recipes that you enter onto hard disk. Other than that I really don't have too much of a problem with this program. I mostly use it to enter my own recipes. We had major computer problems and because my recipes were not saved to hard disk i lost all of them. It was very upsetting. Now I have to re-enter everything and again I am faced with the dilemma of not being able to save them on disk. I am thinking of buying Master Cook and using that instead.
2,The New Begining 2012,Its something about this film that bother me thats because im a film makers im not here to judge those involved in the making of this film i would say if redone today that the result will be different as fur as directing and acting is involved in this production i would like to redone this film again if possible what was lacking was the story lines that didnt grab the attention of the viewers and professional camera equipment ...! Sign GM
4,Too cute!,"Great little hat! Keeps baby's head warm, and you just can't help but love the little ears. The only thing that would make it better is if it came lower around the ears. As it is cut now you will have a hard time covering baby's ears without it covering baby's eyes. Otherwise it is great."
5,Too stinkin cute!!,"This hat is just adorable and keeps my baby's head nice and warm! I bought the black one, but plan to buy at least two more in different colors!!"
2,Hard To Fit - Doesn't Cover Ears,"The color is exactly as pictured. However, for us, one size was too small, so I ordered the next larger size and instead of being wider around the band, it was taller and stuck off the top of my baby's head too far. And it doesn't cover ears, so I ended up just returning both sizes. Cute otherwise."
3,Too small,"The sizing guide was not quite right. This hat was too small for my 6 month old. If you order, get a size much bigger than you think you need. Also, it was not as thick or warm as I thought it would be. Overpriced, IMO."
5,"Very cute, and easily adapted for other purposes.",This was a comfy and warm little hat. I got some yarn and sewed pigtails onto the ears to turn it into part of an Abby Cadabby costume for a cold Halloween. The 18-24 months size fit my slightly-petite toddler perfectly at 18 months.
5,Great little hat for our little guy,"I was looking for a simple winter hat with a little character for our little guy. This is perfect! It does run small, just FYI. My son is 10 months old and the ""24 months"" hat fits great, with a little room to grow. Highly recommend."
5,Adorable little hat!,Love this little hat! It is warm and cozy and looks precious on my little boy. Wish they made larger sizes for when he grows out of this one (which will be soon)!
3,"Nice hat, too small","Never got a wear out of it, it was too small by the time it arrived. Should have gone for the larger size."
4,sizing is great not super warm,This hat works great for us. I would saying the sizing is true but its not the thickest hat out there. We live in the midwest and it works great for cool fall days and mild winter days but I think we will have to switch to something thicker for the days it's freezing out and the winds are whipping.
4,"Super cute, but a little small","I loved using this on my daughter - it was nice and warm for the winter months and is so darn cute. But it was a bit small. I bought a 0-6 month size, but my daughter (who had a 50th percentile head size) grew out of it at 3 months."
2,Zutano Hat....Not My Favorite.,"I purchased this hat based on all the good reviews that it had previously received; but I have to say that when it arrived I was very disappointed. The hat itself is very cute, but I was not thrilled with the quality. To me, I thought that the fabic it was made of felt very cheap. It was returned."
1,Not compatible with Windows XP,"There is no description of this product on line. Please note that it only references Windows 3.1 (Circa 1993) and will not install with Windows XP. It is quite a shame because it looks like a beautiful little program for DECK design. I was looking forward to quickly and easily creating a parts list. Stuart Gannes, Director, Digital Vision Program at Stanford University created this award winning program. The company was sold in 1997 at which time Gannes accepted a position as Vice President of Internet Applications for AT&T Labs in Menlo Park, California. Sorry folks. Don't buy this product now unless you're running a VERY old system."
5,Raffi on Broadway,My husband and I thought this was Raffi's BEST video! Not to mention how our 8 month-old daughter is still mezmerized by his music and his spoken word. (He's the only musician she would listen to and watch starting at 2 months!)We appreciated the important messages Raffi includes about peace and the environment. And how he invites and empowers already active children to be a part of his show. We hope our daughter continues to enjoy watching as she grows so the messages he shares in this video can really take hold.Our daughter led us to Raffi and we are so glad she did! She (and we) also very much enjoy his other two videos.
3,Disappointing for fans,"We are HUGE Raffi fans -- well, our 15 month old daughter is, and we like him too, for his gentleness, humor and sweet catchy melodies. We like his environmental and peace message too, but on this video it's a bit heavy handed. He seems stiff and akward compared to his charming, light performance on ""Raffi in Concert,"" and there is much less audience participation because it's a big broadway theater. Personally I found his rap version of ""Brush Your Teeth"" excruciating and embarrassing. I will say that my daughter seemed to enjoy it just fine and that's what counts. Although if she comes to like it as much as our other Raffi video we'll have to sit through it endless times, so it would be nice it was as good."
3,worst packaging ever,"i agree that columbia box sets come in the worst packaging imaginable, but this is by far the worst. you just have to see it to believe it. the best i could come up with is to take the cds out of the ridiculous foam slots and put them within the pages of the book. i would give it one star for this but the music is incredible and i have yet to be disappointed with anything that has charlie christians name on it.-------------UPDATE----------------believe it or not, this trash is nominated for a grammy for 'best recording package'. im absolutely serious."
5,Great!,It's a really fun trivia game for any family guy fan! It was a great christmas present. I would recommend it to any family guy fan!
2,The Good Life,"""The Goodlife"" is a work of fiction. It is very loosely based on the Reso kidnapping of 1992. The histories, characters, settings and motivations,although amusing at times, bear little relationship with the real life of the people involved. Keith Scribner gleaned a few facts from newspaper headlines and created a fast moving imaginary tale which tries, sometimes unsuccessfully, to rise above the meanspiritedness of his descriptions and characterizations. I was disappointed with the author's insensitivity and lack of true research. Read as a novel ""The Goodlife,"" is interesting. It should not be used as an insight into the mind of a criminal or as a social commentary."
5,Simply could not put this one down....,"Every one or two years, I find a book that I read in one sitting. This was one of those rare finds. I bought it for no reason other than I liked the look of it and thought that the subject matter referenced on the cover copy sounded interesting. 267 or so pages later, I put the book down and sat there for a minute in awe. This book is such a great commentary on the disease of ""get rich quick"" mentality of this country. Colleen actually manages to justify her motives and parallel the potential future gains of the crime with hard work and social climbing. Stona (I agree that the name is annoying) and his mental anguish and physical ordeal was absolutely terrifying. I have always had a fear of confined spaces....What a great book."
4,This is the same set as the Musikladen DVD!,"If you missed you chance to buy the now out of print Musikladen dvd, this is the exact same set. Not a concert per se since there is no audience, just the cameras at a tv studio. This is the original trio. The performances are a little stiff due to the lack of feedback from the absent audience.It has great video and audio, unlike the ""Live in central park"" dvd which has awful audio. This DVD and the 1999 Öhne Filter (also German!)dvd are the ones to get. Skip the Central park one."
3,"yes, it is the same MUSIKLADEN show, but it is very good!","The out-of-print MUSIKLADEN dvd is sellling for $70 at the üsed and new sellers in Amazon. This is the one to buy!Your only chance to see the original trio, the only bad thing is that they are playing to an empty studio and it really shows in their lack of energy and give-and-take missing by not having an audience. Still a good performance."
5,A must for any America fan.,"This band has been a twosome for 34 years, but were a trio for the first seven. This DVD is America in its original form at the height of their popularity in 1975. It is an even better collectors item now that Dan Peek passed away on July 24, 2011."
2,Sad,"I love America. I was looking forward to seeing a rare example of all three of the guys together, but this DVD has truly awful sound and the band acts as if they just got finished with a terrible fight and aren't speaking to each other. Kind of depressing."
3,DVD documentry,"These two guys made a killing in the music business with basic easy listening songs. Overall: not what as interesting as I expected. They got my money on this one, too!"
2,America - Live 1975,"The original line up with Dewell Bunnell, the videos are of a studio recording. Very dated, but OK."
3,A Mixed Bag,"The title pretty much tells the whole premise behind this book. Mystery stories by today's writers and the stories that inspired them. Like most short story collections some are very good, some not so great. ""The Wedding Gig"" by Stephen King is interesting, ""Murder Two"" by Joyce Carol Oates not so interesting. A few, like Harlan Ellison's ""Tired Old Man"" and Benjamin Appel's ""Murder of the Frankfurter Man"" are thought provoking. As I said, a mixed bag. On the whole I think the good ones outweigh the not-so-good so if you like short fiction you could do worse than this book."
4,Beautiful Photos!,"The beautiful photos throughout this book really inspired my family to get out and enjoy the waterfalls of western SC.Overall I can highly recommend this book especially if you live in Oconee, Pickens or Greenville Counties. It is advisable to doublecheck other resources after choosing a waterfall to visit."
2,"Pretty pictures, poor directions","Despite the very nice photos by Mr. Brooks and Mr. Cook, some of the directions can be a bit misleading. After following the directions from this book to Kings Creek Falls, I became considerably disoriented and only found the falls after consulting with other directions from online sources. Mark Morrison's Carolina guide has much better directions, though less photographs. Online researching will also provide many, many more than the 27 Falls located in ""The Waterfalls of South Carolina."" Check on Allen Easler's website or the Greenville Online Outdoors for more falls and, hopefully, better directions. If you just want to look at the pictures, though, this is a nice little paperback."
4,Excellent resource for SC waterfalls,Great book. Terrific pictures. Good directions. Limited corrections to some trails are needed since print date. Book was worth purchase price.
4,Canoscab scanner,The product is fine. It is a little more complicated to use than the last one I had. The installation worked. The uninstall that was with my former scanner didn't work correctly so it make the install of the new one a problem. Canon online gave me good directions and software to uninstall the old one. All in all I will enjoy this scanner a lot.
4,hal,the only concern is that i think it should include two film masks so that one could be loaded while the other is processing
4,Started using right out ot the box!,I purchased this scanner because I live in the country where no one seem to have a fax machine. This Scanner was was a way to kill two birds with one stone. I used it to transfer my documents into my computer and then e-mailed them. My only dissapointment was that I should have gotten one that scanned legal size documents. But this thing works great.
2,Dust Collector,"Hooked it up, but could never figure out how to scan my old negatives. Just packed away and a waste of money."
4,Cannon 4400F scanner,"The ability to scan four 35 MM slides at a time is nice. It takes about 4 minutes to do the scan and the software used to edit and clean the images up is very good but not as good as more expensive software packages. Occasinally it seems to fail to see the slides and generate images that are not useable or, it may see only 2 or 3 of the four slides. In these cases, it can usually be corrected by deleting the unuseable images and rescanning. The photographic scan and copy functions work very well."
4,Great Scanner!,"I bought this scanner about three weeks ago. Prior to choosing it I looked at quite a few reviews. I haven't used the scanner for anything other than scanning some 35mm negatives and slides. I found it to be incredibly easy to use, with good quality images. I use Microsoft XP, and had no trouble at all loading the Canon software. This is a nice scanner for the price."
3,"Inexpensive, not bad, maybe better","I bought this scanner/copier to make ~2000 images of photos (prints and/or slides of original paintings) to link to corresponding records in a database. I use Corel Paintshop Pro instead of the image-processing software provided, but have no reason to think the latter is inferior. The scanner works, and the images of both 35-mm slides and 4x6-inch prints are pretty good. It scans up to 4 slides in one batch, but prints go one at a time, with useful automatic cropping. It's fairly slow and clunky, but it does the job, and I'm gradually enhancing the database with pretty links. The documentation is a little sketchy in places but OK. I haven't used the copier function. I'm a novice at using this device; someone with more and wider experience could doubtless use it more efficiently and might give it a better rating. I'm amazed that it can be sold for under $100."
4,Scan interface doesn't auto-list all DPI options,"The TWAIN scanning interface doesn't automatically list DPI settings over 1200 if you choose platen vs. film/slides. After searching the manual, two pages on resolution didn't mention this, but another page did, that you can type in the desired resolution into the drop-down box!"
1,Built for idiots,"Wayyy disappointing from the folks at Canon. The interface is made for morons...if you want configureable options, look elsewhere. Slow as all hell...think 5+ minutes for a ""high quality"" scan which is only roughly 220kb. I wanted a scanner, I bought a toy. If you are serious about scanning 35mm negitives or slides, this model isn't for you."
5,Excellent Scanner with multi built in function,I like the product very much. It is has 4 different way to scan. like PDF format and other image format. Another one I like is the PDF book format.I is worthed to have it.
3,poor operationg instruction,"I have been trying to use this scanner for the past 30 days. Although I have been using computers and gadgets for the past 20 years, I am still confused about finishing different tasks with this scanner. The instruction starts very clearly, but it fails to tell you what to do next after you have scanned a document; for example, where to retrieve the file which was just created. I still have not figured out how to scan the front and the back of a 4""X6"" flyer so that the finished product would appear on one single sheet, ready for printing. After contacting Canon customer service, I received a reply fairly quickly, but my question was not answered properly and instead I was given instructions on how to create a PDF file. Perhaps whoever wrote to me had different answers ready and just sent me one, which he or she thought was the most appropriate."
3,Good for the price but weird software,Nicely made but very geeky software so its difficult to finally get the scan into word or name the saves easily..epson was better at this but had really faulty software...I wish I had read more reviews and gone for something with more flexible software
5,"Good scanner, basic usage so far","I haven't used the scanner extensively yet but the quality seems to be very good with the documents that I have used so far. I bought it primarily because it was recommended by ""Consumer Reports"".The one-touch e-mail, PDF, etc. buttons also seem very convinient."
2,Poor software,"The software for this scanner is for the birds. I,ve been trying for days to check out the features, but keep losing the image or can,t find it anywhere. Unlike my old visioneer where scanning is so easy and all the scanned image is in one place where it is easily found."
4,"Easy to use, mostly","I use it mostly for converting 35mm slides to jpgs. Sometimes, for some reason, the scanner treats the slides as negatives. You need to change the order of the slides in the holder to ""fool"" it back to the 35mm setting. Other than that, it's been great."
1,CanoScan 4400F Does Not Work,I had high hopes for this scanner but after 1 1/2 months it is getting returned. It worked fine at first but then I began to get error messages when I'd try to scan something. I reinstalled all the software and made sure I used the cable that came with the device (I had been using a longer cable I had due to lack of space near my computer). That seemed to solve the problem but then last week I began getting error messages again. It's barely been used so back it goes.
4,Canon CanoScan 4400F Color Image Scanner,"Very pleased with the Canon CanoScan 4400F Color Image Scanner,I look forward to getting good use from this scanner.Thank You Steve N"
4,Easy to use scanner for 35MM Slides,"I bought this scanner specifically to scan old family pictures that were on 35MM slides to iPhoto. The software was easy to install on my iMac. To make sure that it was compatible with Leopard, I followed the directions from Canon to update the driver off of the website. So far I've had no problems. I have two scanners hooked up to my machine, this CanoScan 4400F and the all-in-one Canon MX850. I can use either one without having to reset or unplug one. The PhotoSoft application provided with the 4400F scanner provides some additional capabilities that I don't have with iPhoto. The only thing I'd recommend is a way to scan more than 4 slides at a time. Otherwise this machine has met or exceeded all my expectations."
5,Fantastic slide converter,I never review products but had to for this scanner. I'm using it to scan my 87 year old grandmother's slides for Christmas and the pictures are coming out wonderfully. Very crisp and clear and so much fun to look at! I highly recommend this scanner...
4,Canon 4400F scanner,It works great. Great images and easy to use. It even helps you clean up poorly taken pictures. One negative though is speed. It is really slow.
4,A really good inexpensive scanner and really good for film negatives,"I haven't used the various features a bunch but I bought this scanner to be good at regular scans and also be able to scan film negatives. I had two different Microtek scanners before and each came with a film negative scanner attachment. This scanner is much easier to use and the results are 10 times better. Instead of having a separate attachment, the film negative holder is built into the lid which has a cover when not scanning negatives. When you choose negatives, the backlit activates and, when it scans the strip of negatives, you can then choose which negatives you wish to convert to pictures. The colors didn't require much fixing in PhotoShop (like my previous experiences)- just be careful of dust and scratches on the negatives. It might not be the best scanner overall at any price but it is definitely a great scanner for the money."
1,"Great, when it works","I replaced another failed Canon scanner with this 4400F. I used it 6 months. It worked sometimes, and the quality of output was great when it worked. Nothing wrong with the scanner, but it doesn't like the software. Google ""cannot communicate with scanner"" for all Canon and you'll see what I mean. Save yourself a lot of trouble and get an HP. After owning many Canon products, I won't buy them again. Very bad experience."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"Read the reviews and thought I was making a good buy.Had problems getting the scanner up and running on Vista, had to spend 45 minutes with Canon to get to the point it is now.When you want to scan a doc for email, it will only let you scan and send one doc per email. So if you have 20 pics, you have to send 20 emails.The PDF function does not function.Oh well, at least I have a copier out of it.Would I take my money back for it?? YES in a New York second!!"
4,"Easy to Use, Decent Scans","I bought this scanner because we had slides my father had taken in the 1950's in France & Germany when he was in the service, and I wanted to get those pictures into our digital library. The scanner is easy to use, does a decent job, we ended up with better than I had thought we would for picture quality, and everyone is loving being able to look at the slides that heretofore were relegated to a box in the attic. I haven't used it for anything but slides, as I have other scanners, but I have done about 500 slides. I haven't experimented too much with the various settings, but I didn't have any problems making the thing work."
5,Canon CanoScan 4400F Scanner,Using scanner to convert old photo albums to digital files. Very easy to use and I am pleased with the quality of the scanned files. I wish the scanner had a power button though. Not a big deal and the price is very reasonable.
4,So far so good,"After reading other reviews I purchased the 4400F and have been pleased. I especially like the color quality as I purchased the scanner for digitizing artwork (watercolors, colored pencil, sketches) for photoshop manipulation. I also like the cover design which has a hinge that allows for thicker objects or books. I haven't been able to use the ""easy"" buttons on the front but haven't given it much time or study either."
4,Quality Scanner,"If you're looking for good quality scanner this one should fit the bill. I purchased it just for the capability to scan photos and business cards in a high resolution, but this one does a lot more than the simple reason I needed it for.I got frustrated with the complexity of the software, being somewhat of a novice and not needing the 7 programs it installed on my hard drive. (4 of them on the desktop) I had to spend too much time just to find the easiest way to use it to fit my simple needs...but I guess if you use its other capabilities that would be a good thing. It is a good quality product, and if I do need some of those other bells and whistles in the future at least it will be there!"
3,Very slow scanner for negatives ...,"I bought this scanner for scanning several old negatives. Although it serves the purpose, the performance is poor. It is extremely slow. The parts to load the negatives is a cheapy plastic. It does not snatch properly when negatives are loaded. It is painful to load negative roll with 4 frames and leaving the remaining two as empty. The software that comes with the scanner is ok. Installation was awful...I would definitely recommend some other fast scanner if you have lots of negatives to scan. For all other normal scanning needs, this one would do a great job.Overall performance is good - I would give 4 star. For negative scanning I can only give 1 star...."
3,Slow and clunky for scanning slides,Scan quality is good but I estimate I can do about 40-50 slides an hour if I'm lucky.Slide holder is delicate and will eventually break. It would be nice to buy a couple extra film/slide guides for loading while a set is scanning and to prepare for breakage. But you cant buy them.Also no on off switch?! Come on.I would have gone with the 8800 or a better slide/film converter solution had I better investigated.
4,canoscan 4400f,"Excellent in the ease of use, quality, and tolerable speed for the price. I used it to scan old 35mm slides and I am very satisfied. The included software is simple. Mac Version"
1,Quickly obsolete,"I did like this scanner for the price. But Canon has this bad habit of not creating new drivers as Operating Systems change. Since switching to Mac's Leopard OS, the Canoscan 4400 doesn't work worth a lick. Blurry, bad detail with inexplicable white speckles. My Canoscan 8000F at work is basically dead because they won't make a driver for it. Nice scam, Canon. I won't buy another Canon product."
4,"So far, I think it's great","I bought the 4400F after reading various reviews and comparing scanners for slides. So far, it has worked great. One reviewer thought the device that holds the slides was flimsy, but I had no problems with scanning almost a thousand slides. I would have liked better instructions on the scanning options, but I'm happy with the end results: good scanned images (even despite the mold on many of the slides). I've used the scanner for photos and documents too, all with happy results."
4,So simple to use,"After years of using complicated scanners, this Canon 4400F is so simple to operate. I wish I had gotten one earlier."
4,works for me!,i bought this so i would be able to put my panoramic shots on my computer without having to pay a lot to get them done at a lab. the film scanned really well and i was able to adjust the size of the frame to fit the panoramic film. i use a horizon kompakt. it took me a little while to get used to the software but it's not super hard to do.
4,Canon CanoScan 4400F Color Image Scanner (1306B002),Canon is always a great product to buy and expect to last longer. it did its job well to my requirement and I'm still using it.
1,Cannon 4400F Review,So far I have found this product very complicated to use in conjunction with the various software applications that are used with this product. I will continue to try to master it's use but to date I am not at all satisfied with this product.
1,Annoying and difficult to use,"The user interface was horrible. The product documentation was even worse. I still can't figure out how to perform a regular scan, no OCR. This was poorly designed, poorly supported. Get some other scanner, this one is impossible."
1,Looking for a document scanner - get the Fujitsu S300,"Since I didn't want to spend a fortune on a scanner I was debating for months whether to buy this Canon or one of the other models under $100. But as I mainly wanted it for documents, none of them seemed right. I recently stumbled on the Fujitsu Scansnap S300 - for $260 (there's also a model just for the Mac). After I blanched at the price, I read the reviews and took the plunge. If you're like me and mainly need a scanner for docs, this is the one. It is fabulous. I'm running Vista 32. Installiion is a snap. It is not a flatbed, but you can scan up to 12 docs at once, it scans both sides, and takes seconds. The included Organizer software is really easy to use. It's well worth the extra $."
5,Great Product and Fast Shipping,"We the freeNezy testers at eJawab found that the Product was Great. We acutally had this shipped to our member directly from Amazon via Amazon Prime. They got it in 2 days flat and were very happy. Which made us Happy. Amazon Prime rules.- Vikram Jhaveri, Chico"
4,Scanner Canon 4400F,"Me parece que el software que acompaña al modelo es demasiado complicado, el scanner como tal, es excelente"
4,Canned Scan,"The Canon Canoscan 4400F Color Image Scanner worked literally out of the box after installing the software on my PC. The scans are great, it is not the fastest but it is bearable. Unfortunately the software when running brings my pc to a painful crawl. Deep six the software and aces up for the hardware at this price point. You'll need to steal a few more bucks from your wallet to get faster scanning out of a box at this price. The only other drawback is it is for a 8.5"" x 11"" not 8.5"" x 14"".www.Powermastery.com"
4,Worked as expected,This is a good scanner for the price. Seems to scan fast enough. I'm concerned about some of the flimsiness of the 35mm slide attachment but time will tell on that.
3,Canon Scanner,Good product. The software for scanning slides is a little awkward. Doesn't allow scanned files to be saved and continue scanning as far as I can tell. Had to exit the scanning tool bos to save files.
5,Very pleased with this scanner,"I had no previous experience with a scanner. I bought one so I could scan documents and photos into my computer and to use as a ""copy machine"" (by sending the scans to my printer). I have been very pleased with it. It has operated flawlessly and done exactly what I want it to do. The quality of the scans is very good. It does not seem very fast to me (I have no basis for comparison), but for my home use it is quite adequate. If I need to do volume copying, etc., I go to an office supply store."
4,Works great with iMac,Purchased our first Mac and found our older CanoScan would not work. First tried an Epson as replacement but this was problematic with our Mac so we returned it and purchased the Canon. Works as advertised. Installation easy. The buttons are a great improvement compared to our older scanner which was only driven. Operation is very easy.
4,Canon Scanner,"Good scanner with excellent resolution. Software is not ""user friendly""; too complex. Top of unit is curved and if desk space is an issue, it wont support any thing on top of the unit. Negative and slide scanning a plus."
2,Canon CanoScan 4400fFColor Image Scanner (1306B002),"I'm a little disappointed in the Canon Scanner because I thought the advance in tecnoledge would have produced a better, more advance product. The white cover used to scan photos is a flimsy piece of cardboard, which Im sure will bend,ware out, or crease some place. More frustrating is trying to put the flimsy piece back on."
5,Cannon 4400F,This product is easy to setup and works very well. For the price it is hard to beat. Works great with Windows Vista...
4,Canon CanoScan 4400F Color Image Scanner,"I am very pleased with this scanner. Very easy to scan pictures, slides documents and 35mm negative strips. I give it 4 stars rating."
2,Vista Compatible? I think NOT,"I got this product based on the reviews and the notation that it was Vista compatible.Help for the product is NOT included or supported by Windows Vista. When you go to the online Vista page (non geeks or 12 year olds beware!) nothing listed will download, all are incompatible with my year old Dell with Vista scr**ing with its programs.So the question is, ""Is it the hardware or the software?""Well, next time I go to Mac."
5,CanoScan4400F,"I am very satisfied with this scanner. As a teacher, I use it for classroom purpose by scanning worksheet, documents into PDF form so students can download and use. It is fast and produce great quality."
5,good film scanner for the price,I purchased it to scan negatives and its good in that..Very good resolution and software is also user friendly.Only concern is it accepts only 6 neg per scan. I think 12 should be more productive. But for the price its nice tradeoff..
5,A lot of bang for my hundred bucks,"The 4400F was a snap to install and set up on my Intel iMac, for both the Mac OSX and the Windows XP partitions. Output quality is excellent, the scans are fast and the machine is quiet. I compared it to an H-P before buying, but chose Canon instead. It's also small and doesn't take up a lot of space. For less than $100, it's great."
5,Great for film,"I use this mainly to scan film. It is a little slow, but the quality is awesome. Great product, great price."
3,4400F Review,It is a pretty nice scanner once you set it up. BUT the set-up was not easy. I had to call Canon support and it took about an hour of my valuable time.The warm-up time is long and annoying.
2,Copying 35mm slides,Quality is fine. I object to the 2 minute scan time for each slide. Maybe this normal. I don't have experience with other devices.
4,Canon CanoScan 4400F,"I like the quality of scans coming out of theCanon CanoScan 4400F Color Image Scanner (1306B002). I bought it to digitize old negatives and slides for my family. The device appears to be feature rich with functionality but I doubt I'll ever use any of the ""one touch"" buttons however I can see how others would. The software lets you toggle between novice and advanced. My only complaint is that it should be a little easier to scan negatives without touching them. The negative tray is a little awkward to work with but it does get the job done. I understand theCanon CS8800F Color Image Scanner ( 2168B002 )might be better suited to my needs but I was working in a budget and the price was right for the 4400F."
3,Nice Picture,"This TV is a great addition... I use it in my office. However, the DVD player is not working great! It plays the DVDs that I can get in there. Sometimes it takes a bit for the DVD player to read the DVD and at times I've had to take the disc out and put it back in before it recognized it. Now, the problem I'm having is that the DVD's get stuck in the DVD player. Other than those 2 issues, the TV is great. I wanted it for the in-house scrolling announcements that are playing all day anyway. The DVD player was the plus to it, and I do use it."
3,A picture isn't everything,"The Audiovox FPE1506DV 15-Inch LCD TV with Built-In DVD Player, Card Port, and USB Looks great in the add. The add shows a wide screen TV with several great features, However when received the TV was a standard width TV. This was a great disappointment. E-Mail to Audiovox was answered with the statement that I could change the ratio of the display. My complaint was then marked as closed with no further replies from Audiovox forthcoming. The picture is misleading and I feel fraudulent in intent to deceive."
1,This tv is terrible,The dvd player hasn't worked since the first 2 months I had it. It constantly has to be unplugged and reset due to blue screen.
5,LET'S GET THE PARTY STARTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i have been fan of aqua since the start, they are great. this cd gives you the BEST songs from both of the cd's, plus a bonus mix of cartoon heroes,the HAMPENBERG CLUB MIX! the cover work and pictures in side are great. the pics are rare and cool. the disc is enhanced and has the videos for CARTOON HEROES AND AROUND THE WORLD. the lyrics to all the songs are printed in the cover. this cd is one that i can put in and listen too over and over again. the thing i don't like about it is the biography inside is in japanese and i can't read japanese. if you buy it you will love it, aqua may not be together any more but they still rock! check this out, september 29th is the release of ""PLAY WITH ME"" the solo album from aqua's lead vocalist LENE. the first single off it is ""IT'S YOUR DUTY."" i don't know if the cd will be released here in th us, but it will be great. she sounds great on the new track. enjoy!!"
4,Heroic enough,Bought this due to pester power from my daughter.She is thrilled to bits with the album and hasn't stopped playing it since I collected it from our local post office (after having paid an extra nine pounds in customs charges).
4,Definitely Worth a Read,"I bought this book while on a buying binge at Borders, and my plan had been to find some sensual erotica, and if it had the paranormal,etc flare to it, all the better. While I would not really classify this book in the erotica category, (such as the excellent Secrets series)it was quite sensual and the genre was fun. I thought the idea of 3 stories, all stand alone tales of their own but cleverly connected by 3 different authors was a refreshing way to present this sort of fiction. My assumption would be that writers would be proprietory w/their story ideas so to find a collection like this was unique. I don't have a favorite of the 3 stories, as I stated before, all are stand alone stories and are equally entertaining. It kept me reading until I finished the book. While I haven't yet decided if it will be among my ""keeper"" collection, its definitely worth reading and I will keep my eyes out for more from these authors."
3,Yow! Hot like a firecracker!,"Ok, let's be honest-the plots aren't the best fleshed out-but the bedroom scenes certainly are. I would classify this book as erotica with a paranormal twist. Kenner's story is very good and super hot, Kearny's was OK at best but Leto's was pretty good.Again-this book is VERY explicit-so if heavy duty sex scenes bother you then I'd suggest you skip this book. Otherwise-if you like 'em spicy then you'll like this book.3 stars."
1,Not the chairs you're looking for,"I bought these chairs 6 months ago, and they've spent spring and summer on a north-facing, covered patio. They never got wet, and I don't think they even saw freezing temperatures. I sat out on that porch maybe once a week. Last week I gently sat down on one of the chairs as I usually do, and the bottom cracked apart. There appears to be no warranty on these chairs. I don't plan on purchasing more from this company."
5,Excellent Folding Chairs,"These chairs are excellent, although I was a bit off when I received them and I felt they were ""wobbly"". Because of the hardware and the natural spacing needed for folding, the chairs wobble when being unfolded, but once you sit in them, they are very sturdy. The are comfortable even without cushions and perfect for sitting at a table. The wood, the hardware, and the finish are top notch. We like being able to move them easily to the front and back patios and the upper terrace, wherever we want to sit or to have extra seating."
5,Awesome!,Very pleased with the purchase. Chairs are comfortable and super easy to assemble. Great set with the folding table.
2,"Greenwashing alert--Amazon , please check FSC claims","I ordered two of these chairs BECAUSE they were specifed to be FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certified. However, when I received them there was informational material and a decorative metal tag, but there was NO documentation of such certification.AMAZON--PLEASE CHECK ON FSC CERTIFCIATION IN ADVANCE.It seemed like too much of a hassle to return the chairs so I still have them. On a positive note,they are good looking and are holding up well.(One of them has been outdoors under a tree this summer.) They would be much more comfortable if the seat and back were contoured.For that reason I find I don't sit in them much. I WILL NOT BE ORDERING FROM STRATHWOOD AGAIN--DECEPTIVE ADVERTSING REGARDING OUR ENVIRONMENT IS INEXCUSABLE."
3,missing hardware,the chairs are great but they didnt send the hardware for 2 of the chairs so they are sitting useless in the garage and I dont know how to contact the company to get the hardware
4,Hardwood chair from Amazon,"I was looking for an outdoor wood chair that would withstand the elements, with out breaking the bank. Time will tell, they are on my boat, and will be put to the test with sun and salt. So far so good, and they are a perfect fit."
5,"Great for the price, sturdy and attractive","We purchased this set of 2 folding armchairs to go with the matching bistro table. They look amazing on our balcony-- the color of the wood is beautiful and classic. We added two cushy seat cushions from IKEA and really recommend getting seat cushions, as it makes the chairs quite comfortable (I've sat on them for about 3 hours straight doing work). The chairs are sturdy, attractive and have held up well in the heat and humidity of New York City. We got them when Amazon was having a summer patio furniture sale and the price was unbeatable. The chairs were $89.99, the table was $21.52, plus shipping the total was about $150. An amazing set for the price."
2,"Looks nice, falls apart","I did a lot of research to find a nice set of patio chairs made from wood that is sustainably harvested, and was quite happy when I first got it. I kept the chairs out of the sun, applied teak oil twice to keep the wood in good condition, and just after owning them for a year had both chair break within a few weeks of each other. The seats cracked at the back where they attach to the legs, and there is no way to repair them. The people that used them only weight about 170lbs and there is no reason the chairs should crack, but I noticed upon looking at the construction that the pins that secure them only go in about an inch, which is a very poor design. I will not buy these again and next time will be looking for something that is of higher quality and made in the U.S."
2,Broke really quickly - pretty flimsy,"I ordered 6 chairs. They look nice and are very inexpensive. Unfortunately, 2 of the 6 have broken in less than 3 months. In each case a wooden piece of the seat itself split in half."
4,Folding Armchair,"The chairs arrived just as Amazon stated they did. Coming right out of the box, they were assembled, and like other reviewers have stated, all you need to do is tighten up the bolts with an Allen Wrench. For the price, they appear to be of good quality and sturdy craftsmanship, but like some other reviewers, they need to make them both taller and wider, but don't let that discourage you from purchasing them.All in all, a good bargain."
1,Returned twice,Ordered 4 chairs...sat on them once...and 2 broke immediately. They were replaced and I am softly sitting on them and not letting anyone over aprox. 100 lbs or so to sit on them. If another breaks I will try to return them all for a refund.
3,Not so hot!,"These look good, but one of the arms on one chair was wobbly.We did not send it back, because you have to send both back, and that was a big pain in the neck since we tossed the box for the good chair. So, we tightened the wobbly arm, but it didn't help it much. Now the other chair is also has a wobbly arm. We got serious and fixed them using a drill and new screws, but hey, we should not have to do this, right? If you can fix furniture, go ahead and buy them, but otherwise find something better. I gave them a 3-star rating, because after we fixed them, they are okay and still look good."
4,Good quality chair at an affordable price,"I purchased four of these chairs from Amazon for use at my seasonal campsite. The chairs are of reasonable stability and a look of quality. I am using these with a round table with wicker edging that matches other patio deck furniture at my site.When I received the chairs there was one bolt that was had come out. I made sure to check the boxes for any other loose parts and once I had the chairs out of the box (they are 2 per box), I found where the bold was missing and put it back into place. I also took an allen wrench and tighted all the bolts in the chairs. I like the fact that the chairs fold which will make winter storage much easier.I would recommend these to others who are looking for a good quality wooden chair at an affordable price for outdoor use. Keep in mind that ongoing care of the wood will make them last longer as any outdoor chair which is subject to weather conditions will deteriorate over time."
1,Not reliable product,"These chairs do not last. Within one year of purchase, one chair snapped along the seat line. The construction of the chairs was sloppy, with connections that were constantly loosening, and required never ending adjustment. Luckily, when the one chair broke, no one was injured. The chairs were certainly not worth the price that was paid for the set. We do not trust the other chair at all, so the whole set is wasted money."
1,Don't buy!,These chairs and the table look lovely. Unfortunately I returned table for a replacement and now will return the chairs. The wood does not hold up outdoors.
4,Nice,I received the chairs in only 3 days. They come out of the box already assembled. Nice look and are comfortable to sit in. I have no complaints.....
3,Chairs pretty nice,"Arm sere a bit loose and had to be screwed tighter..still not too sturdy. /They are very nice looking, but the seats are pretty hard..not comtured to your body. Have to use cushions. Price was very reasonable and time will tell how they hold up./"
3,Pair of chairs used for camping,"We bought these chairs for camping and to sit in our back patio. The wood is pretty and has a nice finish.m oeuvre, the hardware for the arms is cheap and bends easily. Fortunately, I was able to use the chairs without the arms attached. I recommend that the manufacturer not include the arms&#347;."
3,"Great pictures, but...",Steve McCurry's work needs no presentation and in this book you can find the atmospheres an the richness of colors that distinguish him; but the quality of printing is really poor and I think the Editor of this book should know that a great photographer is not enough to have a great book.
2,"Plotless, but excellent writing","I picked this up on the recommendation of a travel guide book, as an example of good writing by a Scottish author. The writing is very good, but the Scottish nature of these stories is near to non-existent. What connects these stories together is their theme of adultery, a theme that is fairly common to mainstream literature these days (I've an aunt-in-law who used to complain that it was a criteria for Oprah's Book Club), but one that I had heretofore avoided in my own reading diet. Unfortunately, the saliciousness of these short stories was fairly mild, and while I found Kennedy's writing quite admirably, at the end of each story I found myself saying, ""So what,"" a common complaint I have with modern short stories, which tend to be heavy in style and character and light in plot or substance. I did end up reading every story, so that's something of a recommendation, in the sense that if plot isn't necessary for you, you might find this book quite worthwhile."
5,I bought the dvd from the firm website,"I ordered it about 6 weeks ago and I am still waiting for it to be shipped! The website said give it 15 days to be shipped from time of purchase, hello!!! Where is it? I called AND emailed the company, they said it's all most ready to be shipped, hummm. Needless to say, if you want the dvd anytime soon get it from Amazon. BTW, I had the VHS set and the fanny lifter and LOVED it. I lost 50 lbs, went from a size 18 pushing 20 to a size 6. I did however do weight watcher and walked too. But I give the Firm with fanny lifter credit for the toning. These are killer tapes (DVD's) after doing what I call ""the butt buster"" where you lay over the fanny lifter and put a weight behind your knee and lift your leg over and over... I couldn't sit down for a few days. Just wait, you'll see."
2,I'd pass on these!,"I love the old Firm videos, but I wanted to try something new. I started with the cardio tape. There was no explaination of the moves and they went so fast it was impossible to follow for me ( a person with no ""aerobic moves"" experience). If you have a hard time following moves or are not coordinated this video won't work for you. I'm sure over time I could figure it out, but the workout/instructor is so boring, I won't bother. I then tried the body sculpting and it was just OK, again pretty boring. I have yet to try the abs tape. I was really disappointed with these tapes. I do love the Fanny lifter and use it with other Firm/Fitprime viedo's and I think it's great. I recommend trying the old Firm tapes or the Fitprime tapes instead."
2,Disappointing,"I disliked these new Firms because the pace Body Sculpt was too fast, there was hardly any Cardio in Cardio Sculpt and Ab Sculpt just wasn't interesting. Pass on this set."
1,IMPORTANT-PLEASE READ ABOUT THE FIRM!,"I have to get word out that if you order from The Firm, you better hope that you paid for what you wanted and no more. I have had an ongoing battle since March of this year to get refunded 3 times through them after being charged extra for stuff I didn't order. After several phone calls and letters, I got no response and empty promises. I reported them the the better bussiness bureau to try and get my money back and they still didn't follow through. I am beyond angry and very upset and wanted to let everyone know before it happens to someone else. Even though it has nothing to do with the workout, there are so many other workout routines and tapes that are just as effective. I hope this at least lowers some of their sales and gets a message across and lets people see that THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THIER CUSTOMERS!"
4,Very effective all around,"I love this system, I finally found a video that combines strength and cardio, because I cannot afford a gym membership and following magazine strength moves can be confusing if you don't actually see it. The Firm is very effective, my butt is getting very shapely!! The only problem I have is that the first few times doing this, the moves cued happen immediately and they don't tell what they will be, so after 5 times, I know what I'll be doing next, but at first you have to stop and realize what they want you to do.(...) my Fanny Lifter fits perfectly together and taking it apart and moving it out of they way incorporates more squatting and even just a slight, but hurried, break from the strength moves. Why would you complain?"
2,Going down hill,"I have many of the other THE FIRM tapes, and I must admit THE FIRM has really lowered its standards in this new DVD Body Sculpting System. The production is of a lower standard (there is no scene index, for example), the workouts are not as intense as they once were, and there does not appear to be the seriousness that the tapes once had. Nothing wrong with trying something new, but THE FIRM missed the mark on this one."
5,Nothing Beats The FIRM!,"I was introduced to the FIRM videos back in 1999 and nothing compares! I started out with Volume 1 and then later got Standing Legs! That was in college, and it wasn't until after I had my baby two years ago and tried everything else that I decided to go back to the FIRM videos! And just in time too, because now they have new instructors and videos! I purchased the BSS and it rocks! Yes, the older videos, are just that,""older"" but if you get the FIRM philsophy and are a beliver you know it works and that's all that's important! Plus, they have an awsome online club where you can get help and advice from not only the instructors but other FIRMies as well! Now what other video collection can offer that? The tapes and club membership more than pay for themself! As a matter of fact, I quit the gym because the FIRM is all I really need! And if you eat right and put the work in, the results come sooooo fast!"
2,Not Challenging Enough,"These new Firm series, are just not challenging enough. By the end of the tape, I barely worked up a sweat. It felt as though I wasn't working hard enough. I much prefer the older Firm series, they are more challenging. The new Firm series are good for someone who is a beginner. I swear by the older Firm series."
3,These Firms give a good workout but.....,"These tapes are awesome. I do like the new firm tapes. I get a nice workout. My favorite is Cardio Sculpt. Allie is a great instructor. Ab sculpt is the tape i use the most and I dont think its worth more than 10 dollars. Though I do like Lisa Kay, this workout is just boring. Now these new tapes arent like the old firm videos. The background is really really boring and so are their costumes. And the instructors dont face the crowd like the old ones. The music isnt that motivating either. I own about 30 excersize videos and they all have the same songs on them. The older firm tapes had different music, which made them stand out even more.All in all, these tapes are fun and challenging. But if you want something more exciting and different you might want to get the older firm tapes. They are truely the best on the market."
4,Great Workout,"This is a great set of workouts to use. The ab tape can be used daily, but at 20 minutes is a good length if that is all you have time to do. Body sculpt can be done both lower and upper body or just one at a time. The cardio is a long 55 min workout but does get the heart rate up. I agree with other reviewers when wearing a heart rate monitor you would be surprised how good of an aerobic workout even the body sculpt gives. You cannot fast forward some of the stuff at the beginning of the DVD and that is frustrating at times. The moves are easy to follow and you can vary intensity by increasing weights. I would recommend this set to anyone that enjoys using weights to work out."
5,The Firm workout is great!,"I bought the series with the fanny lifter in February, and I have already lost 10 pounds. I think the exercises are very good and I enjoy doing the tapes. I don't understand why everyone is bashing these tapes. When you go to a gym to do aerobics, do you have flashy scenery? I think not! Concentrate on what is important, weight loss, toning, and feeling good. I know these tapes have been a tremendous help to me and the instructors are excellent at what they do. Keep up the good work!"
5,"Great workouts, quick results!","If I can do this, anyone can!! I got these tapes as part of the Firm Fanny Lifter pack. I have never been in shape my entire life, and finally I am sticking with the program of working out and eating right. I'v lost 15 pounds in only 3 weeks of the Firm - and am only 12 pounds from the goal I set for myself. Not only that, but I have a lot more muscle, I can actually feel hard, toned muscles in my legs, arms and abs, and see them too! It is a big difference, I know if I stick to these tapes I'll surpass my goal.It might be hard at first, and you'll be sore and exhausted, but just keep doing it, and soon you'll find that it gets easier!!!"
2,The Firm is not what it was,"What has happened to The Firm? Their videos used to be the best--the best production, the best sound quality. the best music. Now they look and sound like copies taped on a cheap VCR. I still love the older Firm videos, but if they're released by GoodTimes don't buy them. The quality of the tapes is so poor I can't even do the workouts."
4,Good Outweighs Bad,I have started doing The Firm body sculpting system again after a 2 year break and I can definately see results after the first 10 workouts. My favorite tape is Cardio Sculpt. I find it easy to follow and quite a good workout. I don't really like the ab sculpt. It seems kind of easy and long. Body Sculpt is extremely hard! I remembered why I quit the Firm before- this video is killer on the knees. It moves so fast it is hard to protect your knees. This video also has a section on upper body which is really good- you can skip the lower body if you want. Also the hard plastic step is a pain in the but to move around on the carpeting. I find the instructor (on all of the videos) is moving on to the next move and I am still taking apart or re-assembling my fanny lifter or switching weights. The music does suck and the set is strange. Why are the girls kneeling on and lying on the wood floor-kind of stupid-bad for back and knees. Looks weird! I don't recommend to anyone with bad knees.
3,3.5* Good work outs. Not crazy about all of the trainers.,"Rotating through these gives you a pretty good work out and plenty of variety. Different muscles and different exercises are used in each video so you're not bored super easily. As with all Firm videos, you have to jump right in. The first few times may be a little challenging to keep pace until you know which moves to anticipate and kind of have the videos memorized, but they're easy enough to learn. I have a number of Firm videos, and in every review, I rave about Maximum Cardio Burn plus Abs. It was my first, my favorite, probably the most difficult, and the most enjoyable. I use that video to determine the quality of all other Firm videos."
4,Used but functional.,I purchased a used Dual XDM7510 In Dash CD/MP3/WMA Receiver from Crader Electronics & p.c. repair. I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 only because it took a bit longer to arrive than the estimated shipping date and all the old solder-less crimp style connectors were left on. I purchased this specific unit to replace the same style unit that quit working and the used one works just fine after installation. It arrived clean and in good shape.
4,"Excellent image quality, a little slow at scanning.","Cons: Excellent, accurate image quality. Natural colour tones. Excellent software bundle. Very easy to install and get it up and running.Cons: Slow to scan. Scanner occasionally locks up after a few scans at high resolution (a shutdown & restart of the scanner solves this).Summary: This is my second scanner purchase (1st was a Storm Easy Photo), and I'm very satisfied with it except for the speed: I imagined that the speeds of bargain-priced scanners would have increased since I purchased the Storm Easy Photo scanner 3 years ago. Overall, I'd recommend this scanner to anyone who's on a budget: Truly great scan quality, provided that you don't really care about the scan speeds (about 40secs for a 300dpi scan)."
1,Nothing but trouble,This is the second Astra 2000P that someone in my family has purchased and both are terrible. The scanner is finnicky with connections and the software is often confusing with little documentation to help you figure out how to scan things. I don't recommend this scanner at all since about the only thing its good for is an oversized paperweight!
3,"If at first you don't succeed, buy a bigger computer","I received this scanner as a gift, and the salesman assured my mother that it would work on an AMD K6, which I owned at the time.It did not.In fact, it froze up my computer and sent it into safe mode, which terrified me, and back it went in the box. Later down the road, I purchased a new Pentium III, installed it, and it has been fine (knock on wood!).My only current complaints are this:The scanning surface is a bit small, not much bigger than a standard piece of notebook paper, which can be irritating when you have larger images or text to scan.Bundled with the necessary drivers for the scanner, is a program called Oplimit LE, which is an optical character recognition program, which I installed, only to find I wasn't going to use it. When I went to uninstall it, it had no automatic uninstall feature, and removing it was a major pain in the butt. My emails to tech support took several days to get a reply. It was a major hassle."
4,Good scanner for newbies!,"I found the quality and speed to be just fine especially scanning pics for my web page. The software offers all of the options with regard to resolution, size and the various choices you may want to make for a scan if you are a more experienced user. It's a parallel port scanner so it won't work with XP but it runs great on win98. It might be good to use on a second system with Win98 or maybe for the kids on their system. It's not the best but I believe it's a decent scanner that can be found for an inexpensive price now."
1,Extra cost w/win XP,"Used scanner w/W98 with so-so results. Upgraded to W-XP.Scanner doesn't work w/XP. Sent in $15 to umax for CD thatwas supposed to allow 2000P to work W/XP. Re-installed soft-ware from CD umax furnished, no go. Tried to e-mail umax forsome help, but ran into a long jump-thru-the-hoops process thatdid nothing but frustrate. So, I now own a 2000P door stop.If anyone is thinking about buying umax, I would think long &hard about their products."
1,Yellow Bandidng,"The Umax Astra 2000P seemed to work fine for more than a year. Then one day it started exhibiting a yellow band on scans. Umax offers a methode of resetting the scanner. Some time it works once but most of the time the yellow band won't go away entirely.I've seen where others have the same problem with no remedy. The downloadable driver upgrade is over 20 Megs.My long term impression is that Umax is run by someone from another universe. Their concept of service is really weird. Before you buy their products, peruse the web and see what others think. I won't buy from them ever again."
3,Easy listening+,"Given the incredible talent of the musicians involved, I was surprised to find this album unengaging. The playing stays fairly close to the melody much of the time, and the arrangements don't make up for the lack of novelty. It is certainly pleasant to listen to, but I felt that it fell far short of Brecker's previous IMPULSE albums."
2,Brecker Ballads,"I'm a saxophone player, so I'll tell you right now that there is no question at all in regard to Brecker's command of the instrument.However, his interpretations of these ballads leave me cold.The two cuts featuring James Taylor are lovely."
2,not a ballad player,"Michael is a great tenor sax player, but playing ballad is not or has not been his forte. He sounds like he is restraining himself and waiting to be loose. Only if you really have to hear everything that michael plays."
3,"CD good, but I bought it for the wrong reason","The whole CD is good, but I'm a James Taylor addict and, when I heard the really good and mellow JT version of Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight on this album, I bought the album in a heart beat. I'm not that much of a sax fan, so while the jazz is really good, I really wanted the JT song...and found he recorded two on the album. Mixed blessing."
2,"Skip the beauty, give me pretty","There is SO much potential in the lineup of this CD: the singular talents of the instrumentalists, the subtle and complex simplicity of the tunes, the proven chemistry of the musicians- well documented from numerous beautiful collaborations past, the history alone that these artists have been steeped in; but pretty is the password of the day here.Romantic sounds for a candlelit dinner. Numerous candidates for any ""best makeout tunes of all time"" compilations. Even James Taylor's blessings to validate the safety factor of this project. Nearness of You has all this, and less.Missing are fresh meaningful readings of the (beautiful) compositions, any hint of lyric urgency or that sense of voice that makes a jazz ballad sing. Now I know that Michael, Pat, Herbie, Charlie and Jack have paid their dues and have proven they're beautiful artists. Just don't look to The Ballad Book as evidence. You should buy this knowing the music is pretty and money is beautiful."
2,Disappointing,"Michael Brecker is one of the world's greatest jazz saxaphone players -- he is easily in the same league as Parker and Coltrane, and has more technical proficiency than either of them. But his sense of music, his ability to communicate, and his taste have gone over the edge. What we have here is a wonderful musician playing the horn with ruthless disregard for his listerners. Indescribably bleating (perhaps listening to too much Sonny Rollins) is no substitute for passion and beauty."
5,Does justice to the original!,"Most people know of Pitfall - the old arcade game, ported to almost every computer and game platform in existance, less the more modern systems (hint to Sony and Nintendo - Microsoft doesn't count). But, in 1995, Activision ported the marvelous Sega Saturn video game Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure to PC, and boy, did they do justice to the original. A lush soundtrack, with real sound effects, and your choice of either the tribal music or the ambient sound effects playing in the background enhances the game experience. Secret areas give you little puzzles which reward you with gold, or even extra lives. Other secret areas give you the option to play the original Atari 2600 version of Pitfall.Try it - you won't regret it!"
4,"Wonderful Album by JENNIFER RUSH, an underappreciated artist","I love this CD! ""Search the Sky"" is one of the most beautiful songs I've heard. Definitely worth tracking down (it's out of print). I originally got into Jennifer because I am a HUGE Celine Dion fan and Celine covered one of Jennifer's songs (THE POWER OF LOVE, a #1 hit for both of them). The reason I picked up this one so quick is because it features a duet with Elton John, FLAMES OF PARADISE. I am also a HUGE fan of Elton John. As soon as I heard the first few seconds of this song I knew it wasn't good. It is the worst track on the album. They're voices mix together, well, not nicely. Beside that fact, this is a wonderful CD! Pick up a copy somewhere before it thoroughly becomes extinct!"
5,"Wow, what a voice!","Jennifer Rush is one of the most underrated talents on this side of the Atlantic. Though having sold millions of records around the world, she is still relatively unknown in the US. If you like Celine Dion or Laura Branigan, you'll like Jennifer. She has worked with the biggest producers in the business and has several great albums not available in the US. ""Out of my Hands"" is great! She has a big ""throaty"" voice with mega-power. Heart Over Mind has a kick-ass duet with Elton John and her first album ""Jennifer Rush"" has the original version of ""The Power of Love"", which is still the biggest selling single by a female vocalist in British history. Check her out!"
5,wow,THIS MESSAGE SHOWS YOU THE MANY DIMENSIONS OF GOD IN A WAY YOU NEVER SEEN I LOVE THIS SERIES AND RECOMMEND IT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN KNOWING THE GOD IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT.
4,Edna loves Strange Black Mail!!,"I absolutely LOVE this lick and fold stationary! I am a great admirer of Emily the Strange and I love to write, so when I found this item I had to purchase it! There are five different designs and they are all lined for writing. The only issue I feel people should know about is that not all of the designs have lines available on the front for writing a return address. Out of five designs only two or three of them do not have that, so if you are using these to send money orders in the mail (such as myself) then only use the designs that you can write your return address on them! Enjoy! =3:"
4,she's so strange...,"Ahhh...Emily strange....what can you say!This booklet of ""fold & mail"" stationary is fun ~ there is something strangely appealing about Emily ... a brooding little child and her devoted black cat [equally broody!]."
4,Fun,I love this stationery set and so do my receivers. Emily is great fun and it all comes in handy: sticking the paper together to send it away as an envelope. It's worth your value!
1,Flimsy,Poorly designed and flimsy. When assembled the T base wobbles so the table does not stand straight. Overall it does not feel solid or durable.
2,Laptop cart,"When fully extended it is not at all as sturdy as the reviews indicated. (I should have read the ""Flimsy"" report more closely.) Quite the contrary, it is wobbly. Rather than return it (shipping is too expensive), I will need to find a way to stabilze the cart. I should have purchased a hospital quality cart."
3,The secret: there are no secrets here,"I was disappointed in this book. Though 25 escapes are described, with various misadventures, etc., there are hardly any tips or tricks revealed. Good from a magician's code of honor viewpoint, but misleading. I was also disappointed in the photos-to-text ratio - nothing wrong with lots of photos, but most of these scream 'filler' to me. I think this is a perfectly ok book if you want to read what it's like to do Guinness Book-type stunts. If you're a Houdini fan, there's better out there."
2,Just to much way to much #!**,Very poor story line and killer sex. Some will like this book in fact the Advocate.com said it was a must read. So I did .. just like a low budget porn move it got tiresome quickly. I may pick it up where I left off on some cold rainy night if I am in the mood for it. I use Kindle so there is no problem going back to it.
5,One of the Best,"Not a bad cut on this gem. Wonderful fidelity that showcases the collaborative efforts of the musicians and how well they work together. Good learning tool for business managers on the importance of collaboration, and team efforts to create a wonderful product."
1,Is this book a joke?,I honestly don't know if this tiny tome is meant as a joke or a serious interpretation of what entrepreneurship is to the English. Either way it's a sad commentary on why the English economy is in such a sad state. The authors have no clue about what it takes to launch and build a comapny. I wouldn't give this book to a 6 year old contemplating starting a lemonade stand.
1,This book is quite disappointing,It's perplexing to see such high ratings being given to a book which would make an eight year old roll his or her eyes with contempt. Perhaps the authors' mates are being called upon to post glowing reviews to pump up the ratings? It has happened before.As a reader all that I can say is that the book promises a great deal but delivers almost nothing. The authors appear to understand little about business and entrepreneurship.
5,forget the MBS bs - this is the real world,"absolutely brilliant well written book.extremely realistic depiction of what it takes to get businesses off the ground.for every overfinanced VP led venture that succeeds MANY crash and burn. why is that? read the book adn find out.key insights into what it takes to get a business going and run it both your way, in accordance with your vision, with a reasonable chance of success.If would be interesting to know how many of the negative The author has - several times."
1,Don't waste your money,I read this book on a recent cross-Atlantic flight after finding it in the pocket of the seat ahead of me. Happily I did not pay for it and left it in the pocket afterwards as well. How many people have now read that copy or parts of it and not found it worthy of keeping we'll never know.The book maybe of help to someone totally ignorant of even business basics but most of us will simply be embarrassed for the authors and publisher. The content is minimal and the editing atrocious.Don't waste your money.
5,"A good, quick read.","The book is a step by step guide from initial idea to great business, with wisdom that only successful business people, such as the authors, could give. The clarity of thought is amazing. Especially helpful is their outlining of key success factors for each stage of a business, and how success factors change as the business grows. People, sales, finance, mentors, elevator pitch, business plans, motivation and leadership are all covered in clear and succinct fashion. No fluff. A good, quick read."
3,3 stars; so you'll get something from this book,"I found it quite a light read (no bad thing) that certainly skipped along (it unfortunately skated over certain issues)...yet some points resonated strongly and I did enjoy it. It's not a long book, but neither is it an expensive one; and it does have some meaningful points to make. I'll be re-reading it again shortly."
1,Dismally Bad,I have to agree with the other reviewers about this book being just plain atrocious. Why the British publisher is now trying to sell this book here is beyond me. It's akin to a Texan trying to sell a book on how to run the monarchy to the English.
4,Love It!!,"I absolutely love this changing table. I'm the kind of person that hates clutter, and the cabinet - like design helps me hide all of the little things. The only complaint I have is that the open shelf is sagging slightly (you can only tell by opening the doors and looking at it from the underside). There is a metal bar to support the top and bottom shelves, but not the center one. Other than that, I love it!"
4,Great for the money,"I really like the style of this changer. I am impressed with the amount of storage space. The exposed shelf is big enough to fit two big baskets for diapers and changing supplies. The underneath compartment is very large. Also I am impressed that the changing space is wide. My daughter fits on it very well and will for months to come. The only thing I don&#146;t like about it is that the supports under each section seem very flimsy. As my daughter gets heavier I will be buying some more metal supports to help hold her. My husband was very skeptical about this piece when he saw it on the website, but he just recently commented that this was a good choice."
4,very pretty table,"I purchased this changing table and so far, I am very pleased with it. It came before 14 days and there were no dents or scratches.It's very pretty and very spacious.I had purchased my storage baskets from another store and was worried that they wouldnt' fit but I've got 3 small baskets on the top and 2 large baskets in the drawer with room in both areas.The construction was not bad but being 7 months pregnant it was a little difficult at first for one person to construct. That's the only reason why I gave it 4 stars.Overall for the price I love it."
3,Not Bad,"I have to agree with most of the other reviews. The directions were horrible and it took sometime to put together (2hrs). The shelves (including the top one where the baby will lay) are very thin layer of particle board which does concern me. It does look very nice once it's all together and there is a lot of storage space. Not a bad purchase, but I am definitely going to look into reinforcing the shelves with some more brackets."
1,Don't Waste Your $$ or Time,"After searching long and hard for a traditional changing table, we finally found this changing table and thought it was going to work perfectly. Unfortunately, once we opened the package, we were truly disappointed. Between the terrible instructions, the flimsy and damaged pieces inside, we immediately packaged it back up and sent back. Highly recommend saving your time and money and find another changing table that is more sturdy and made of quality materials."
4,"Pain in the[...] to assemble, but well worth the hassle...","Unfortunately, the other poor reviews were right on about the lack of detail in the instructions for assembly. Husband and I spent about 60-75 minutes assembling this product and at the end, we ended up realizing some pieces had been attached incorrectly due the illustrations being horrible and innacurate. After getting everything assembled, I must say for 80 bucks, this was 100% worth the hassle and hubby agrees. It's a very nice, sturdy changing table with a lot of storage space in the bottom cabinet. I love it, it has the look of a much more expensive piece of nursery furniture. Would definitely buy again..."
4,Great for the money,"This changing table is far sturdier than anything else I've seen in this price range. The directions are very difficult to follow and the pieces are not well marked. You'll need two people to figure it out. The pad it comes with is no good, I will definitely purchase one, but this is a nice piece of furniture which seems very well made."
2,Nightmare to Assemble,This looks nice now that the 4 hour assembly is completed. Terrible instructions-really they need someone to go through and re-write them in a way that makes sense! My poor husband.
4,GPS Software,It shipped quickly and got there when expected. The problem is that the softwares manual is not very user friendly and can be confusing for 1st time users.
2,Are you kidding me?,"I honestly do not know what Topo US is good for. I have hunted for hiking trails but haven't found any in my area... or any area for that matter. I have found pipelines and powerlines... whooptie do...Also, I use my Garmin for road navigation... I assumed that TOPO would overlay street maps... WRONG... There are like a million little TOPO maps and I have to go into map setup and individually enable/disable the maps... a major pain when scrolling through 50-200 maps. The TOPO has streets but then are WAY out of date. like 20 years out of date. and you HAVE to look at the old roads when looking at TOPO data.Some friends had me do some searches on underwater wrecks for deep sea diving but they didn't come up... I honestly don't know what this software is good for.2 Stars instead of one because there ARE topolines and mountian peaks."
4,Garmin Mapsource Topo,"I found this product to be very easy to use, and load into my GPS. It is quite detailed, perhaps more than I expected. I occasionally come across either errors, in road placement, or in some cases it simply isn't up-to-date. However, this is not common enough to be a major issue for me. For the money, I am glad I purchased this. It sure makes my GPS more useful. It is not as detailed as the USGS maps, but, not bad!"
2,"you do not have a choice but, it is not that great","the title says it all- you have to use this for Garmin (if I am wrong please tell me so I can buy something else) but, it is only marginal. Not very up to date or detailed. i have been very very disappointed."
5,Season 3,"When are you going to make the entire season 3 available to buy as an instant download? I see the episodes, but it is a little pricey to buy this way."
1,another great Serie from the 80s,"This is another great series from the 80s but its a BIG BIG BIG shame that Warner Brothers cancled again a DVD release. And I don't understand it. I really would love to buy the whole serie on DVD.Sadly I'm from Switzerland and can't watching it online through amazon-video.Common WB, give us Fan's a chance!!!!!"
3,Good Show but poor quality,Jane Wyman and David Selby are strong performers. The rest of the cast is average to mediocre. The quality of the film is very poor. Color is not intense. The film needs to be reprocessed.I enjoyed FC in the 1980's and enjoy watching it again with my adult children. Angela Channing is so cunning!
5,Awesome,So Happy to be able to watch this classic show again. Hope to be able to watch all the seasons.
3,it about the words,"at times this book was incredible, at times i was bored. but i will say this. if you are studying signs and language this book MUST be read!"
2,Dense essays about man's 20th century blahs,"There are very few books that I have been unable to finish because of ennui, but this was one of them. I made it about 2/3 of the way through and had to call it quits. This book badly needs editing. Percy asks some engaging questions to begin the book, but it is all downhill from there."
5,Great product,"I love crockpot recipes...so finding this CD was like striking gold! The recipes are fantastic! There were not very many photos. That was kind of disappointing, but over-all, I'd give it an A+. For ..., this was a steal of a deal. I was even more pleased with the features of the software. I can add my own recipes, e-mail them to friends, download them to my Palm Pilot, print them on 3x5 cards and more. I give it very high marks."
5,I'm A Convert!,"Anne Marble has been trying to make me a fan of classical pianist Glenn Gould for ages. After watching this film twice and then ordering the CD of the music, I must admit that she has won. I don't even like classical music generally but Gould's passion and charisma cross all boundaries plus reach out and grab one by the throat. I just can see me collecting one CD after another of GG's in the future and I didn't need another obsession! A great scene in this film is GG playing the piano while we see items from his medical situation pass across the screen: Xrays, blood pressure counts and so forth. This was a very effective way of foreshadowing his stroke and death at age 51."
4,A film more than a documentary,"I was expecting a documentary of Glenn Gould, ie, with exclusive footage of Gould, short interviews, etc. What I got is a 'film' about Gould acted out by another person, Colm Feore. For those who are not familiar with this film like me, please be aware of this fact before you buy it. Otherwise, this film is tastefully done, employing Goldberg Variations to link the different segments together. One extra note for those using a region-free DVD player: this DVD works fine on both of my region-free DVD players (of different brand names)."
5,Amazing and Inspiring,"The reputation of this unique and thoughtful film speaks for itself. It's a must-see and must-own for any classical music lover.Sony is MY HERO for re-releasing this title, and for doing such a good job of doing so. I had been searching high and low for an *affordable* used copy of the DVD -- but to no avail. Until now!! My enthusiasm for this movie and for this re-release cannot be overstated!"
4,Clever!,"I like any documentary that tells its story in an unusual way. I'm tired of the standard, endless structure of most biographical documentaries: ""He was born here, in this year, to these people, grew up learning this and doing that, here's an unusual twist, then passed away/went insane/disappeared/still struggling/making a comeback ..."" Of course, I was not familiar with Glenn Gould prior to watching it and so didn't have the ""actor doesn't look like him"" problem. It's definitely slow in many places, it demands attention and a good night's sleep, but that's also one of it's charms: it provides room for interpretation. Just a very clever way to tell a story."
2,didn't care for it...,Not what I expected... missed seeing Glenn. No shots of Glenn in the entire film that I could find... just interpretations... which I did not find satisfying... too bad.
2,Should not be listed in this category,These are short pieces of movies about Glen Gould not paino music performences. You don't see any real Glen Gould playing piano in this DVD. In that regard I am dissapointed or I might have been misled to think these are some documentary films about Glen Gould. Actor Colm Feore's performences in #6 Hamburg and #9 LA Concert are two of the interesting pieces to see. But in my opinon this DVD should not be listed in the Musucal and Performing Arts category where most people buy DVD's are ofter watch the performences again and over again such as Glen Gould's Goldburg Variations. I centaily will not watch this DVD again.
2,Mostly uneventful and somewhat pretentious,"I like Glenn Gould. I didn't care for this movie however.1) The actor does not look like Glenn at all in my opinion, which I find distracting.2) Its very disjointed, and a lot of the components offer very little insight about Glenn or his life. One scene was Glenn simply going into a restaurant and listening to other people's conversations. Big deal, this is not interesting. I know this was supposed to offer a subtle insight into his personality, but it's boring and it comes across as pretentious filmmaking. Another example; Glenn is listening to a record with a cleaning lady. Thats it. Why is this interesting? Someone could film my uncle in Wal Mart, but would you care? Hey, look...My Uncle Carl is buying batteries. Now he is putting his change in his pocket. How utterly profound....In my opinion, you will learn and understand more about Glenn Gould by listening to his music than watching this lackluster, uneventful movie."
2,Confusing,"The computer graphics were excellent but there should have been more to the DVD. The ""action"" was disjointed and there was no coherent idea. Unfortunately, the computer graphics were spoiled by too much anthropomorphism. I thought this would be a good addition to my collection of dinosaur documentaries but I found it not to be so. Rent it, don't buy it."
4,quite interesting,It gave the dinosaurs a mind and a story. It was humorus at times. It was intertaining. The animation was well done.
4,VERY COOL,"This was a fun movie. The dino's do a lot of fighting and some are a little bloody and many are eaten.the t-rex paint job has to be seen,very cool. The dinosaurs seem to have been given more personality in there day to day lives than in other dino documentaries.I have seen much worse.CGI was very good in most parts except for the magic mushrooms one apatosaurous sp. ate and was tripp'n ...this is quite the dino eats dino movie and went on to show the aftermath of the meteor strike .many humerous occurances that could really have happened.watched it three times."
5,Great DVD,i never got to watch this series on discovery because i didn't get the specific discovery channel it was on. i downloaded the episodes so i could watch it while i waited for it to come out on dvd. Well worth the wait. The only change they made to it was the title. its original title is Dinosaur Revolution.
3,"Some very good, some less so","This CD has three great songs: Love Is, Save the Best for last, and Dreamin'. The rest of the songs are just OK. This is why it just doesn't pay to buy CD's. I can't recommend purchasing the whole CD just for three songs."
2,Just OK,"I bought this CD in order to get a few of the ""big hits,"" and that's what I got--no more, no less, as most of the other songs are just so-so."
3,ok but needs work,this cd was pretty good but it is too short for me and some of the sides did not sound right too me.
4,A greatest hits album......,"As with most greatest hits albums, this album doesn't have ALL the hits. There are standard hits and serious and casual fans will be happy that 2 of her most successful singles ""Love Is"" and ""Colours Of The Wind"". That isn't quite enough to make the album a hit. Some deserved songs are glaringly missing such as the grammy-nominated ""You Can't Run"" and her best single in recent years ""Happiness"". The new songs are fine and memorable but they don't make up for the disappointment felt about the album. It'll be a great collection for casual listeners but ultimately, they have no idea what they're missing out on."
3,Greatest Hits-Vanessa Williams,"While Vanessa is unquestionably my favorite singer, The Greatest Hits album fails to deliver a true feeling of just what this wonderfully talented singer is all about. I feel the main mistake is the great lack of material from The Sweetest Days. While it did not meet with much success, it was a great album, overshadowed by her record label's inability to market it at all. Also Missing are some of the great pieces from Next. This album recieved even less attention, but again was great, despite the record label showing it absolutely no respect. The Greatest Hits album contains plenty of early stuff, but not enough music from the last two albums. In addition, I don't thing it would have been out of the question to put some songs from Star Bright, even though they are Christmas related. That album, I believe, was her best sung album yet. In short, it needed more new stuff."
3,It's Decent.,"Besides Madonna, I can't think of another female artist who's reinvented her career as remarkably as Vanessa Williams. The onetime Miss America faced some big hurdles in the beginning of her career, but since then, she's enjoyed a string of pop/r&b hits, a decent stab at the movies (""Soul Food"") and a few appearances on Broadway. This hits collection sums up her recording history, and it does the job fairly well. At first, I really hated the single ""Save the Best for Last,"" but this admittedly drippy ballad has grown on me within recent years. She fared better with the r&b flavor of ""The Right Stuff"" and the Babyface composition ""Betcha Never."" Ths disc ultimately gets weighed down by bland ballads like ""The Sweetest Days"" and ""Colors of the Wind,"" two songs that are as drippy as anything on a Mariah Carey record. Still, Williams gets props for surviving her hurdles in life, and while I can't say she's one of my favorite singers, this CD is worth a spin."
5,THROWBACK THEATER: Divatastic!,"Really, don't be too fast in counting Vanessa Williams out, because here's a collection that showcases her talent and versatility in the R&B world...and may I say that she did put a glorious dent in it. Hot dance tracks--check. Sensitive ballads--check. R/B & Pop collaborations--check. All accounted for and ready to go! I hope that for Ms. Williams, there is another greatest hits package that includes her hits afterwards, and this time, howzabout including DARLING, I, which happens to be my favorite ballad from her. Until then, keep it diva, Vanessa!"
5,THE TOP OF ROCK CHRISTMAS ABLUMS,This is the ablum that all others strive to beat. They wrote some of the classic rock christmas songs that almost everyone thinks of. The only groups to come even close in my opion are the MOTOWN christmas ablums
3,Fanatics only,"The original Beach Boys Christmas Album is terrific, the extra cuts here come from an effort from Beach Boys to hammer out a quickie Christmas album to satisfy a contractual obligation. The record company nixed the idea and the Beach Boys subsequently delivered MIU Album. I can't say that I blame the record company. As a huge BB fan, I found it hysterical to hear a Christmas carol sung to the background track of ""Peggy Sue"".These later tracks on the album are a hoot. If I wasn't a fanatic I wouldn't find it as funny."
5,It makes my Ultimate Christmas,"There is nothing better than putting up the x-mas tree, drinking some egg nog, and listing to Beach Boys, Ultimate Christmas........nothing."
4,"If you want a Nostalgic Christmas, this CD is for you!","Regardless of whether you like the Beach Boys, you have to admire their harmonies through out the years, and their ability to produce quality product. This CD is no different. The extra songs are definitely worth it to the Beach Boys fan that already has this CD, but to the non-fan, this CD is worth it for the different kind of fun it brings to Christmas. I highly recommend it!"
5,Slumming,Seth Koven has exercised esxcellent scholarship in this fascinating account of Victorian London. Koven delves deeply into the various motivations (from charitable to journalistic to seeking a sexual outlet) of upper crust individuals who chose to frequent the slums of London. A must read for anyone interested in the cultural history of Victorian London.
3,Video Quality is on par with VHS tape,"Plain and simple, the video on this DVD looks like it was remastered from a VHS tape. Sound is as expected....good. Video is not.....poor."
5,Saw The Show 10-1-06,"It was the greatest show I have seen. Ian was on fire from the begining. The first song Eurology Ian came behind the drummer a bars into the song, from there it was non-stop Ian tunes and Tull. The orchestra was from Boston Conservatory a chance to play w/ Ian and the boys. Didn't wont the show to end. Five Star show. Catch if it comes to your city. Bristol, Vt. Doug"
2,Could have been 4 stars........,"The first DVD that I received had a momentary pause and then something flashed on the screen for a moment. This appeared on any DVD player, apparently some sort of a defect when putting the production together. Amazon replaced the disk without a problem but the replacement DVD predictably did the same. I don't have the patience to keep returning the thing until the error is corrected. That's a shame because the concert was different than most others, a nice mix of Anderson's lighter music and classics, and quite enjoyable. I would have rated this a 4 if I could get a DVD that wasn't flawed."
5,Terrific!,"If you like the music from Jethro Tull, you are going to love this DVD! There are quite a number of selections played and then there are interviews interspersed. The quality of the video and audio are outstanding! This is a great product!"
5,An excellent choice for parents searching for the just the right bedtime story,"A popular addition to any school or community library picturebook collection, Beba And The Curious Creature Catchers by Lydia Griffin is enhanced with storybook quality illustrations from Stephanie Lostimolo. This is the story of an extraordinary young woman, Beba, and her adventurous pursuit to save a Zeebroose. With help from her trusty straws and quick thinking, Beba And The Curious Creature Catchers carries young readers ages 5 to 8 through the entertaining tale of Beba and her creative approach to saving the forest from the creepy Curious Creature Catchers. With its lively cartoon-quality artwork embellishing an original and energetic story, Beba And The Curious Creature Catchers is very highly recommended reading for children, and an excellent choice for parents searching for the just the right bedtime story."
2,Ordinary stories - makes audience bored and silly,"This is one of the most flopped Psych seasons/series, ever.I was, and still a big fan of Shawn and Gus - but there are few stories in this season which make audience ridiculously bored and silly. Few of such are: ""The Amazing Psych Man & Tap-Man"", ""Dead Man's Curveball"", ""Indiana Shawn And The Temple Of..."", ""Let's Doo-Wap it Again"", "" Autopsy Turvy"", and many more.Compared to earlier seasons, in this season both Shawn and Gus are less-funny-more-silly, forget about being 'interesting' characters.Thus, before buying it, borrow it from the local library, watch the episode then go for purchase - because Amazon still sells such an ordinary, Non-Bluray season with pretty high price($40) !!!Real value of such ordinary season should be around $10"
2,disappointed,"My rating is low on this season because I am so disappointed in the change in feel in the show. This has been a great show to watch with my family up until now with the exception of a few episodes. I've only let my kids watch 2 out of the last three episodes and I haven't found it nearly as funny. The producers have touched on agenda issues in the past, but now they are starting to push them. I loved the emphasis on family and the importance of families staying together in some of the intial seasons. Now we have Lasiter climbing all over a girl in bed and I am supposed to be excited about Shawn and Juliette possibly moving in together. Forget viewing this as a family movie. I hope this season doesn't continue this direction."
5,uh,LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!word aword bword cword dword eword fword gword hword iword jword kword lword mword nword oword pword qword rword sword
1,Love the show HATE the download!,"If you have the choice of waiting for the DVD's to be released, WAIT. The downloads are glitchy and frustrating to watch ( I have access to all levels of computers and had ALL of them do this from Mac's to Dells, toshiba and asus) Very unhappy. Love the show and mad that I can't easily watch the season I need to , to catch up with the series."
5,"Love it, but have to get over how overweight Shawn has become","I recently discovered Psych, and in the past month I watched all 6 seasons of it. Season 6 is still fantastically funny, with great acting, great stories, but I really can't get over how fat Shawn Spencer has gotten. In season 1 he was a beautiful man. I don't want to be mean, but he is hard to look at now, I winced when he lost his sleeves in the super Mantis episode. The show would have been perfect if someone had told him to shed a pound or 40."
5,Amazing quality,"Love for Shawn and Gus, always and forever! The quality of the video is AMAZING! Only thing that could make this better is if were available on PRIME videos."
5,One of the funniest and most under rated show on tv,"Psych is one of the funniest shows on television. It is well written and acted. The characters are rich and engaging. The show has some of the funniest jokes, pop culture references and love of the 80s. It also has a rich father/son relationship, incredible best friends, great partnerships and the sweetest and most adorable romances. The supporting cast as well as the two leads are talented and funny. Psych is definitely underappreciated and underated. It keeps getting better and better. One of the few shows where I own all the dvds and can still watch the episodes over and over and still laugh."
5,"great show, great season!","Psych does it again, with a brilliantly silly, fun, sometimes serious, always fabulous season! I have loved Psych ever since I discovered it and would recommend it to anyone who loves quirky, witty, clever shows with characters you can get attached to and admire. Expect the unexpected, embrace the silliness, and above all, never ever take it seriously. Enjoy!"
5,favorite show,very funny cant wait for season seven watch the first 10 shows you wont want to stop watching it. it was worth the money to buy it
4,More Gus!,"I thought this whole episode was going to be Gus solving the crime by himself, which would be totally awesome! But sadly, since James R. is the main actor, he has to solve every crime too. So sadly, again, no one knew Gus was part of it. Can't there be an all Gus episode? Or one where he's in danger? Please, I love Gus!"
5,Great show,"great show, the family would settle down and watch these almost every night. Well worth it. Frustrating that Netflix had the first seasons for free, but they didn't have the last season."
4,Lie Detector:),"As the title says, lie detector is the best part. (It doesn't exactly say that, but anyway) I loved that and I thought Shawn would finally get caught! But he didn't and the rest of this wasn't super funny, so watch 'Last Night Gus' instead. Now that was a funny episode. And the title of this episode doesn't work. Shawn rescues Darth Vader in like the first minute of the show, and that's it. It was still entertaining, but definitely not the best."
5,Love Shawn and Gus!,"Our whole family enjoy watching Psych together. Thank you for something funny, interesting, and clean that the whole family can watch."
5,Better than both Hangover Movies,I have watched Psych since the beginning. My two favorite laugh out loud episodes were American Duo and Black and White (the fashion episode) until this Hangover spoof came along. This is by far the funniest episode to date. Woody the Medical Examiner is a hoot. Psych is clicking on all cylinders this season. The episodes just keep getting better and better.
5,Lassiter finally won me over,"Timothy Omundson does a very compelling job playing his character on Psych, but Lassiter has never been a favorite of mine. I don't like to see him hurt, but I've never felt much of a connection to him. I feel like we've only gotten snippets here and there that remind us that he's a human being and not a robot or a machine. This episode changed all of that. I'm hoping it's not because they are wrapping up the series (I am crossing my fingers for a 7th season!), but they are really going all out this season. Without spoiling anything, I will just say that I'm generally a very cynical, non-touchy feely person (a less extreme version of Lassiter, basically), and even I was moved by the way the story played out. It's a very Lassiter-focused episode but, surprisingly, it really, really works. Omundson plays the heck out of his role and actually got my heart to break just a little. This episode does a lot of things, but it definitely doesn't ""suck."" :)"
4,Cute and fun,"This was a fun take on reality television. I've been enjoying the spoofs of various shows and movies this season. Of course, I am a psych-o though :-)"
3,A little disappointed,"The dvd's came in good shape so no complaints there. I was a little let down with this season of Psych however. We enjoy Psych because its good clean fun, this season however seemed to have more swearing, Gus was not as funny (seemed less like the funny scared-y cat) and there were more inappropriate jokes. Also they made Gus out to be this weird little perv that was just annoying. We enjoyed watching this show with our nephew but now we have to watch the show first to make sure the episodes are appropriate, kind of a bummer. I hope the next season gets more clever."
4,Good season,"I had some concerns about what the writers would do with the Shawn/Juliet pairing, but for the most part it doesn't appear. When it does, it actually makes sense.The writers do have a stroke of brilliance with Lassie's girlfriend. Really well done, and feel good for Lassie.The catch phrases for this year seem off to me.Another reviewer referred to Late Night Gus being the best episode of Psych - it really is up there in the list of best episodes. However, the 2nd appearance of Blackapella isn't as strong as the first. Really missed Joon.Quite pleased that the finale did not have anything to do with Yin or Yang or his new blonde apprentice. We do get a cliffhanger. Wojo, Wojo, Wojo. As soon as I saw an old Barney Miller cop, I knew what was going to happen.If you like Psych, easy recommendation."
3,Its ok --- But I'm looking for better,"I recently bought this software and find that yes it is very hard to use, but I was able to load it and run it with no problems. I also copied the maps to the hard drive, now its a little faster.... When using the voice nav. the voice is too low to really be useful, while driving at highway speeds and listening to the radio or talking to other in car. The maps themselves are old or inaccurate. I was able to work with it and get directions for some locations, I still need a better solution than this. I guess an Alpine Nav system is the only real solution."
1,"Needed item, great concept, awful delivery","The idea is great. The booklet is nice. However, the volume of the male English speaker (left channel) and the female Greek speaker (right channel) are at such different volumes that one can clearly hear the English but fail to hear the Greek. Even if you do adjust the right and left channels and increase the volumes, the Greek is very nasal. Hard to do on most portable cd players and mp3 players. Once fixed, this would be a great product."
3,Works great but leaked all over 2 closets! Be CAUTIOUS!,"Yes, it works. Yes, it gets rid of dampness and freshens the air. But I bought a 3-pack of the hanging product from Bed, Bath & Beyond and hung them in the closets of my camper. A week later, I was happy to find the bags had started to fill with liquid and the closets smelled great. Upon closer inspection, I found that two of the three bags were leaking and had leaked all over the clothing and brand new closets! Luckily, I didn't have anything expensive in the closets and the stuff washed out of the clothes, but since we were at a campground with no washing machines, I had to wait until we got home to wash everything. And the oily fluid was a MESS to clean up. I used every towel we had in the camper! Now that I read more reviews, I'm hesitant to buy the tubs too, since some have experienced leaks with those as well."
4,It Does Get Rid of Dampness,"I have plaster walls and in the winter, the closets get moldy from the humidified air hitting the cold walls and sweating. We tried Kilz paint, which helped for a season, but then the mold came back. I have installed heating rods (usually for safes and gun cabinets) and have wire shelving laid vertically to keep fabrics off the walls, which also helped. But my robe still felt damp in the one closet. So I hung one of these and in a week, it has collected about 1/4-1/2 cup water. My robe still feels slightly damp, but it is better. I am thinking the combination of all three is finally going to fix my mold problem. They also come in fragrance-free, which is what I have. I started with the scented and it was overwhelming, so I returned it. It definitely collects moisture and is inexpensive, and I will continue to use them."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"Serious damage caused to articles of clothing (through normal usage) by Damp Rid product leakage. In my attempt to resolve this loss with Damp Rids Insurance Adjuster, I sent the clothes and the at fault Damp Rid hanging bag with my assessment of the loss I incurred (valued at min. $1000). In their response, the company spat in my face in their attempt to resolve this loss. Io was offered $90, no admittance of fault, and it was made apparent that as a consumer, I was not a concern for them. Needless to say, I am no longer the loyal user I was, and vowed to share my experience in every venue I could find."
5,Canon CanoScan LiDE70 is Great!,After locating and downloading the Vista drivers for the Canon CanoScan LiDE70 it works flawlessly. It is very easy to use and makes great scans. Other reviewers complained about the noise it makes while scanning but I don't find it bad at all. I like it very much.
4,great item,easy to set up. quality of scanned items is great. a friend had this item and i liked it so much i bought one myself after they recommended. price was about avg. have enjoyed item. would recommend.
4,Bad Vista info,"I bought the LiDE 70 to replace an older scanner that would not work with the new Vista operating system. When I opened the box there was a confusingly written Vista instruction sheet that directed me to Cannon's website to determine if the scanner was compatible. The LiDE 70 was NOT listed in Cannon's list of scanners for which it had Vista drivers and it stated that they might develop one in the future. I decided to run the installation disc anyway. The install went fine and the scanner works as advertised. The noise that one reviewer commented on is there, but not nearly as loud as the reviewer would have you believe. Good Buy!!"
3,"Compact and speedy, but noisy","It's compact, speedy, doesn't require any power supply but USB, delivers good result for the money, but this thing produces very annoying high-pitch noise. I use it at work, at the collection of comments from my co-workers is growing fast. Of course, a scanner is a scanner, and you can't expect any pleasing soothing sounds from it, but, still, I expected something better from Canon."
3,Faster but MUCH noisier,"I have had my previous canoscan 1240NU for more than 4 years now and decided to give it away to an associate and purchased this newer model.The scanning is much faster, crispier but the noise is killing my ears. It is high pitch and loud too. This wasn't the case with my previous canoscan. Another problem is that it is much thicker than the previous scanner.I am so tempted to return this scanner and get my old one back."
3,Adequate for light to medium use. Great for podcasting. Good value.,"Length:: 4:22 MinsThis is a perfectly adequate Boom Mic Stand suitable for use on a desk or for drum/amp mic'ing. I would not characterize it as ""heavy duty"" but for light to moderate use, it should be sufficient. The base weight is roughly 6 pounds providing pretty good stability. The base also has felt pads on the four corners to protect the surface of whatever you place it on. The boom has about 9"" of travel and the boom height starts at 7"" and can be adjusted up another 6"" giving a total height of about 13"". The ProLine MS112BK is a good value but probably not the best choice for rough usage."
1,Do Not Buy,I purchased one of these in January 2011 to eventually use with a Rode Podcaster microphone. What is supposed to be a standard 5/8ths inch screw mount would not hold either the mic or the shock mount. Testing the mic and shock mount at a music store on the exact same model confirms that this particular one I bought is defective. The return window had closed on the stand so the retailer would not take it back.In short Proline is unresponsive and unreachable to resolve the issue. They have multi-year warranties but you can't reach them. No phone number. Their email addresses seem to go to a black hole. They never respond. I can't even file a BBB complaint against them because the BBB can't locate the company.Only buy if you don't care if that company refuses to back up their products.
1,proline = no customer service,"If you have tried to get warranty service on a proline product,you know what i am talking about. Proline appears to be closelyaffiliated with (or owned by) Guitar Center, which will not honorthe 5-year warranty on Proline products. Repeated emails to theaddresses on the Proline website's Contact page have met withno response whatsoever.Think about it -- these are cheap (and cheaply made) productsthat do not hold up well under the kind of treatment they arelikely to get from a working musician. Then if you want themto stand behind their products, they won't even talk to you.Pretty shabby if you ask me."
4,Mostly happy,"I only wish it could get shorter, as I have mine in a portable sound booth that's not very tall, and in order to use the mic with this stand, I have to turn it upside down. Even then, the bottom of the mic (with the wires coming up out of it to connect it to my computer), hits the top of the booth. If this stand could shorten by an inch or two, it would be perfect."
5,Great,"Solid, stable and sturdy! No complaints or cons or outstanding pros either. It's greatly adjustable and easily positionable, what more can one ask for?"
4,nice CD,Much of the same as above. Nice selection of her hits. Good quality and it was good service. That's it.
5,Still great after all these years,"Replaced an old vinyl. Still love the heavy rockers. eleven more words, why is this? more words, why is this"
4,Should have put both hits 1 and 2 together to start with,"The sound is very good and as always with greatest hits compilations there is going to be someone dissappointed with a song not being on there that they think should be. I am also guilty of this and think it is a shame that the George Lowell standard ""Willin'"" from the ""Heart Like a Wheel"" album definitely should be on here. Again it is hard to get everything great an artist like Ronstadt has done on even two greatest hits albums. And of course I could think of many more."
4,Classic Ronstadt,"They're all here -- the hits that I enjoyed in the '60s and '70s. Ronstadt's voice is clear and strong, and she's a master at conveying emotion. From ""You're No Good,"" with its strong guitar licks, to the plaintive ""Desperado"" and her cover of the Buddy Holly hit ""That'll Be the Day,"" Ronstadt mines the lyrics for all they're worth. More than 30 years on, some of the songs are a little weepy for my taste -- ""Love Has No Pride"" and ""Hurt So Bad"" come to mind -- but at the time they were released, I found them relevant. The 23 songs in this collection span much of Ronstadt's career, and it's an impressive one. I recommend this album both to longtime Ronstadt fans and those who'd like to learn more about her musical style."
3,bad recording,"I was disappointed with this CD set because the sound quality seems ""inverted"". It might be a bad reproduction. Instead of projecting sound into the room, the sound is a bit muted and seems to be moving backward, into the speakers. I have to turn up the volume to get any listening satisfaction with this album. (I have an audiophile-quality system and a good ear.)The songs are great, and so is Linda Ronstadt, but this CD doesn't move me much."
5,Linda Ronstadt's Greatest Hits - Doesn't Get Any Better Than This!,"Linda Ronstadt's Greatest Hits, Vol. 1 & 2, holds a lot of memories for those of us who became fans of Linda's back in the 70s. Those songs that made her a star in her early years are present on these CDs and her voice is just as clear and true as we remember. I purchased the CD to listen to while I am busy with housework but I also copied the songs to my Ipod so I can listen to them anytime. I am glad that I found this available on Amazon."
5,Great Compilation,"As noted, this is the original Volume 1 and Volume 2 released together on 1 CD. Together, this combined Greatest Hits collection spans Linda Ronstadt's best work from the 1970s (everything has a 1970s copyright date).I don't know what happened to the other person who gave this only 3 stars, but my copy played loud and clear on my equipment, and I don't buy junk, and my ear can pick up flaws quite well.If you've been looking for Linda's 1970s work, this is the best place to start."
4,nice floor for the price,"very nice flooring for the price. easy to put together. I use it as weight room flooring in an exercise area I have set up in my garage. If you are looking for aerobic room flooring, I would recommend buying the 20mm version."
3,"Good, and cheap, but not great.","These mats are easy to use, and durable enough, but I find them to be too slippery. Not enough friction. They are also a little too thin to provide much comfort on a concrete subfloor."
1,Sent it back.,"The quality of this flooring is far too poor to hold up to ""weight room"" activities and does not include any smooth edge pieces. I sent it back and had a horrible time getting money refunded."
3,Serves its purpose,"I bought this for my son's playroom. I know it provided the dimensions, but it was literally 4 large squares. I was expecting more.. or more surface area. Took longer than expected to ship. Overall, the product was a great price compared to what you'd by at a sports store, toys r us, or target."
4,Small but cute,The item was smaller and heavier than I was expecting. It does not fit a standard sized folder. Perfect for taking things to relatives. An adult could use it to hold snacks and water when hiking but it's a little to heavy for a child to carry for long periods of time. It appears to be well made but since it was so small we have not used it for school. I plan on taking it with when we go to the fair next year.
3,Nice design but had trouble with the zipper,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. The colors are beautiful and bright and the bag was a really good size for her, she's three. The first bag I received had a bad zipper and it was broke by the end of Christmas day after opening and closing it only a few times. I emailed Amazon and the customer service rep was very helpful and I had no problem with the return. I bought her a second one and this one seems to be holding up well. My daughter takes it with her when she wants to bring her toys along. She is able to wheel it around and even carry it on her back no problem. So far so good with the second bag but the zipper does have a weird curve to it the way the opening is designed so it may eventually break too. It is a great size for toddler, between 3-6 but as far as a book bag for a first grader or older it may be a bit small. Overall I have no complaints."
5,Love this bag,"Brought this for my 2 year old. It's really beautiful and sturdy. She loves it. Her words exactly when she first saw it was ""WOW""."
3,camp chef explorer series ex-60lw 2burner,I purchase the camp chef explorer cooking system 2 months ago .the wing nuts was broken and regulator was leaking gas return the first one and amazon send me a new one very fast but regulator still leak a very little gas.Did not want to return it to much hassle. The letter on the knob they are fadind away after you using it .several time
5,It is a Work Horse,"This is a very powerful range. My only negative comment with this item is that the heat it produces is very intense. It doesnt seem to have a ""low"" heat setting. Using the dial on low to simmer causes the flame to die out. We use the item for tailgate parties and canning in the summer. To work around the high heat issue, we take the heavy Cast Iron burner covers off our indoor range to dissapate the heat.I have a 2 burner coleman camp stove that I previously used and this Camp Chef unit is the range that always gets taken to the party.Easy to setup and use. A winner!"
5,Good outdoor burner,Do you have to boil water or make soup outdoor to feed your whole family? This is it. I used the propane gas bottle from my outdoor grill for this burner. Worked great. It would have been much better if it had a built in ignitor. Excellent outdoor cooker. Nice to have one just for emergency use during electric outage.
2,Doesn't hold up to wind,"I purchased this stove for my father-in-law. It looked/sounded like the perfect stove for tail-gating. However, we used it this afternoon and the burners kept going out everytime the wind increased outside. This would be a great stove if the conditions outside were always perfect."
4,"Outstanding, except for cheap plastic thumbscrew caps","I received this stove as a ""directed gift"" (i.e., I picked it out). When it was delivered I set it up to ensure all the parts were included (they were) and everything was working. All was great, except one of the thumbscrew caps on the bolts used to secure the legs to the stove was partly broken off. I chalked it up to shipping damage and carried on.We went on a two-night camping trip with it. We cooked on it four times over the trip. The stove performed fantastically - lit right up, provides good even heat, and plenty of BTU power. As another commenter mentioned, however, it is a bit difficult to get down into the burner area to clean up blown-in dirt, pot-overboils, etc.The thing that made me write this review though was that one of the thumbscrew caps broke while I was setting up the stove - the ""wings"" completely crumbled in my fingers - thus 4 stars instead of 5 for the nuisance factor of having to replace them."
4,2 Burner cookstove,This is a good cook stove.It is heavily powered though and uses quite a lot of propane when on high. The legs are also very flimsy. You cant tell from the picture but there is a wing nut at the top of the legs by the burner you where you must attach to set up. Sometimes they fall off if not tightened correctly.
5,Awesome grill,"Bought this as a gift for a friend because I already own one and I know how good it is. If you keep it covered or out of the elements, this thing will last forever. Seriously, clean it and take a little care of it and you won't need another one. Going on 6 years for mine and it works just as great as it did when it was new. Puts out a lot of heat and I've never had to overhaul it."
4,Great stove for the outdoors,"I could kick myself every time I think about passing on the burner option on my Weber grill. After beating myself up for a year I finally decided to order this for my outdoor kitchen and very happy with the purchase. Its a little utilitarian in design and build, but that is OK for what it is. Only fault I have to it is the burners are ""go big or go home"". Don't plan on cooking with a 6"" skillet on this thing, it is designed to hold big pots and pans and only big ones. One big one and one small one would have been better for me, but I guess most folks that do outdoor cooking are fixing large meals for several. I fixed 2 big pots of spaghetti over the weekend (enough to feed an army) and this thing had the water boiling just about faster than I could get a few grinds of salt and a bit of olive oil in there."
3,"great product, but some misleading info...","based on the images, specifically the one displaying gas tank btu/time ratios, and the lack of info stating that the purchase does not include a gas tank.., you can probably perceive my disappointment when receiving a tank-less burner. Had I more time to look into the product, probably would have passed on this purchase and settled with the many dual burners that are set up on a table and typically use the small non-refillable tanks that can be purchased at any sporting good store. I just got it for camping. the leg-less dual burners that go for about half the price would have sufficed."
5,Good Buy,This is a very good buy. Easy to clean and maintain. Very sturdy. Also good price compared with other retailers. Highly recommended.
4,well designed & constructed miter saw,"I have owned the original LS1220 for several years and have been pleased with the performance. I see Makita has upgraded the blade from a 24 tooth to a 70 tooth blade for smoother cutting. I have been waiting for the orginal Makita blade to wear enough to rationalize getting a nicer blade. My only quibbles so far concern the plastic retractable blade sheath which is flimsy compared to the rest of the saw, and the sawdust collection bag which I quickly replaced with a home made adaptor for my Fein vacuum."
4,Good steady pace,"This workout does incorporate some cardio segments, which are not too complicated choreography wise, but the main focus is the upper and lower body workout. The compound movements (e.g., dips from the step with biceps, leg presses with delts) are challenging without making you anaerobic. The length (50 minutes) is good for a mid-week workout. Is it the most challenging weight workout? No, for those, get the Jari Love DVDs. But is it a good weight workout for the intermediate to advanced exerciser? Yes, if you're happy not being sore the next day. Stephanie is a good cuer and leader; her voice is well modulated, and not too peppy. You will need an incline box (I would recommend the transfirmer over the incline box), and 5-12 pound dumbbells. Why not 5 stars? The ab work. As in the other Firm workouts that do the ab work on the incline, unless you have a death grip on the step, you will slide down. This makes them very awkward to do, even with a mat on the incline."
2,Shoddy equipment & not much of a workout.,"I felt the equipment was not up to par. In addition, you could hurt yourself on it. The exercise tapes themselves were on the level of a beginner-i don't think a beginner would break a sweat."
4,A Good Starting Point for Further Inquiry,"With this book Petre can be credited with having written a solid work on the subject matter. The book is a detailed and I feel throughly researched piece that more than covers the essentials of Napoleons 1806 Prussian adventure. It is a great starting point for people who already have a reasonable knowledge of the Napoleonic era to delve deeper into the Prussian war of 1806. Despite the books richness of information, it is not engaging to those who do not have a great interest in the subject and is very dry, factual, and to the point. It shows small signs of bias at several points, but these can be easily overlooked and scoffed away. They do not take away from the historial value of the book. To conclude, Petres work is well done and recommended to those willing to read this dry if not mundane book."
1,Really needed a ghost writer,"Too much back story, too much opinining, not enough story. I got the part about how much the author believed in the mission, but that became too repetitive. So did the part about how evil Saddam and his henchmen were. I was an interrogator in Iraq. I know the back story. I know about Saddam. I wanted to read this author's story, but the writing quality just isn't there."
4,Sweet Deal,"With Ben Webster and Harry ""Sweets"" Edison blowing at their creative peak, how can you go wrong?However, although this album holds a very special place in my personal jazz history, I just feel that both giants have given much better performances elsewhere (for instance atSweetsBen Webster Meets Oscar Peterson (20-Bit Master),Coleman Hawkins Encounters Ben Webster, or at that grand and fabulous ""Tatum Group Masterpieces""/""Lionel Hampton and his Giants"" album)...Well, don't get me wrong; Ben is as sonorous and subtle as he can be, Sweets is discreetly and subtly singing, the rhythm section is also very good, but I still feel this should have been a better album.But, maybe it's just me..."
2,Betty,"The product is not really what i would have bought had i actually seen in . It functions but it is a cheap vynle material and looks kind of Trashy. Only thing good about it , is that you can rinse it off and it does not hold a smell. I bought another type that was fabric and has been a much better product. Althougth it has to be washed in a washing machine. Overall the fabric Pants are by far a better quality ."
5,for the dog,"Great product for the dog when she needs it. Not big and bulky, nor does it look silly like some of the diaper panties do when the dog is in heat."
3,"Fit Great for Toy Dachshund! 1 night, chewed right through it.","The fit is great, easy to put on, easy to adjust. But the material is vinyl so any dog with teeth might be able to chew it off. Wish it was made with more durable cloth-like material."
2,The Rare Dutch-English Dictionary for English Speakers,"Dutch-English dictionaries for English speakers are rare. Nevertheless, I'm afraid I have a dissenting opinion of this vintage 1950's dictionary not meaningfully updated since. MANY important words appropriated since the 1950's are missing, not to mention the new spelling. Most irritatingly, there is very little usage included (i.e. idioms, examples of usage, linked prepositions, etc.). Much better to rely on Hugo's or Hipolet's (sic). If Hugo's et al is too limited for you, then you're ready for a Dutch Dutch-English dictionary of which many good examples exist, e.g. Prisma which is complete with extensive usage and cheap. Whatever you do, supplement it with Donaldson's ""Beyond the Dictionary in Dutch"" to avoid as much public humiliation as possible when speaking with Nederlanders."
5,An awesome CD. A must-have for every music fan.,"This CD is totally awesome. You hear Hanson doing what they do best - performing music for their fans. You can hear the love and dedication in their voices as they sing songs like ""MMMBop"" - and instant cassic, and the previously unreleased love ballad, ""More Than Anything"". A definite must-have for every music fan."
4,D'bomb!!!,"I thought that this was a great cd, but if you want to hear all of the music without scrming then I wouldnt buy the cd. If you did'nt go to a concert then you well enjoy this cd!"
5,HANSON ROCKS!,"HANSON IS THE GREATEST LIVE BAND EVER! Every song on the cd is just awesome! If your not a Hanson fan, when you hear this cd you probley become a huge Hanson fan. Its a must have cd. This is my favorite cd ever. HANSON ROCKS!"
2,No fun.,"Bad, bad, bad. I'm referring to the guys' singing, that is. Middle of Nowhere was amazing because Taylor's (and to lesser extents, Issac's & Zac's) were so prominent and high pitched. Their high-range vocals fit the airy, bouncy atmosphere of their songs perfectly, but now that they're practically adults by the time of Albertine, they just do not sound right. The istrumentation is great as expected from the guys, but three nearly grown men singing Mmbop with their newly-changed low voices takes all the fun out of the song."
5,Their best cd yet,"Live From Albertane is an incredible album. It just completely blows me away. All their voices are just wonderful sounding now that they have changed. The sound of the album isn't so much pop. Songs like Ever Lonely and Money prove that Hanson really can rock the house. They are so gifted and talented.This is their best yet, so even if you're not a major fan of theirs, go buy it. It is a great cd and it should have peaked much higher than #32 on the charts."
5,OOOHHHH YEAH BUDDY,OH my god you have noo Idea what a good CD this is! I love it! if you like Hanson even a little bit buy this CD now! It is the best CD to listen to if you are sad because it will cheer anyone up. Shake a Tail feather is the best song in the world. I can't listen to it without jumping up and down and/or getting hyper. Once I was listening to it in class and I started bobbing my head and mouthing the words. I got in trouble and almost got my CD player takin away from me. Hanson rocks now and forever. And for all you people out there who critisize them just think about it. You are just jelous Ike wrote his first song when he was just eight years old. They are talented and great looking and they dont look like girls. They have great voices and they will rule the music world forever(in my mind anyway) Peace Love and Marshmallows forever!
3,low voices are a hecka lot better that the chipmuck thing,All i have to say about this cd is their voices sound A LOT better now that they are lower. they dont sqeak and stuff like they used to adn i think it blends well.
5,Awesome!,"When I first heard that Hanson would be doing a live album, the first thing I thought was that it wouldn't be that great. I thought there would be too much screaming in the background and that it would pretty much be a disappointment. Boy was I wrong. This cd is one of Hanson's best. It has songs from ""Middle of Nowhere"" as well as some older, never before heard songs, and a few oldies cover songs. It's great because you get to hear some new twists to the MON songs, as well as learn some oldies that you may never have heard otherwise. I'd recommend this for anyone who likes pop or rock music."
5,The review of Live From Albertane,"Live From Albertane is a great cd.I listened to it last as I was falling asleep,I fell asleep by the eleventh track which was MMMBop.Track 5 is my fave, which is called Ever Lonely.I also like Isaac's solo of More Than Anything.The album cover is pretty neat.The cover features a picture of each boy and the whole group playing together.The inside of the album cover is also pretty neat, it features little pics of them and also one of them features them singing Weird acappla.Overall I would give this cd a five star rating."
1,Too Heavy to Ship or Carry,"Bought this behemoth for a daughter going to study in Spain. Took a bit to receive, then, realized it is so heavy that it cannot be shipped to Spain reasonably (it would cost as much as I bought it for). One might think they would advise purchasers about this in advance (since they proclaim themselves to be the overseas adapter experts). It sits in its original unopened box in my garage & I will sell to anyone wanting it for $10... maybe $8."
5,Excellent reference,"I'm a bit of a geek when it comes to Spanish grammar I guess. While others loathe it, I absolutely love it. So I study out of different spanish grammar books almost on a daily basis. I thought that I had found the best and most organized grammar book in ""A New Reference Grammar of Modern Spanish"" by John Butt. And as far as content and detail goes it wins out over ""Manual de gramatica"" but in clear explanation ""Manual de gramatica"" far outstrips the former. I should they are also both aimed at different groups too. The former aimed more at advanced speakers and professionals and the latter obviously an intermediate to advanced student guide. So I suppose it isn't fair to compare the 2 but I think they together are a good compliment and I use them both quite a bit."
3,Nice Content But...,"If you are purchasing this book for use in a Spanish course, be aware that if purchased from Amazon, the book does NOT include a ""book key"" for online access to publisher tools.Be sure to check with your college bookstore or your instructor to see if the key access is something you will actually need before purchasing from Amazon.To purchase a key from the publisher will cost $53.00 on top of the original purchase price of the book."
4,Third Year Student,"I purchased this book on the recommendation of my prof for 300 level Spanish courses. I have a few others that have been required for lower level courses and all of them have the same information, but I will say that this one has been the most helpful.It is basic grammar, but it has full explanations and exercises with an answer key in the back for self-study. I purchased a well-worn copy for cheap and am glad to have it.¡Cómprelo! y buena suerte :)"
3,Spanish grammar made expensive.,I had to buy this book for a college course and soon found that my $10 Practice Makes Perfect texts are just as good.
4,great,"only thing I have found that works on stink bugs, no other fragrance seems to work, I have told other people about this but it is hard to find now, thank goodness for amazon!"
1,Some of the Worst Music I've Ever Heard,"I bought a used CD a few years back by a band called ""Shockheaded Peters."" It is fantastic gothic-like hard rock with a Shakespearian quality to it which I find very novel and interesting.I tried to find any other albums by this band, with no luck. Then I thought to search out the label to see if there were something similar in quality or spirit. The label was Cyclops.I bought this sampler and the #4 sampler. They are both extremely disappointing. Even the worst Muzak out there is better than this bland, annoying, unisinspired stuff. Used CDs don't sell for much to begin with, and so I'll unfortunately have to probably toss both of these sets in the garbage bin as I don't want them polluting my music collection.Just thought you should be forewarned...."
4,Interesting,"The book was pretty good as I recall (it was a while back when I read the book). If I remember right, the book seemed liked it ended TOO abruptly (Mazer left 'ya hanging). But after searching on Amazon I see why: There's a Sequel. It was A good book overall.P.s. If I recall corectly, There was some mild profanity in it."
4,A Boy at War,"A Boy at War was an awesome book because it was full of suspense. The book is about a boy named Adam who moves a lot and is new to Pearl Harbor. One day he goes fishing with his friends and Japanese planes start to bomb Pearl Harbor. As he is running away he sees his father's ship, The Arizona, sink into the water. I think Harry Mazer is a great author and this was a fantastic book. I would recommend this book to all readers from 10-12 who like war stories."
3,A Boy At War,"A Boy At War, By Harry MazarIt was a very interesting book. It kept me glued to it and I didn't get bored. The only bad thing about it is at the beginning it took me along time to get into it. It's really slow at first, but then it picks up. People that are intereasted in World War II would like this book.The book is about a boy whose dad is in the military and he gets transferred to Pearl Harbor, a naval base in Hawaii. He met two boys named Martin and Davi. One morning they go fishing at Pearl Harbor, and while they are out in the water the Japanees started bombing. You need to read this book to find out if they make it out alive.By. Travis Stoecker"
2,This book was horrible,"I thought that this book was a waste of money and trees, because Mazer has no creativeness to him. He was trying too hard to make it like a movie, but the real newsflash is that it was just plain bad."
4,This Action-Filled Novel,"When I started reading ""A Boy at War,"" it immediately grabbed my attention. This action-filled novel will leave you on the edge of your seat until the very end. ""A Boy at War"" is the story of a boy named Adam. Adam is continuously moving, because his dad, Lt. Pelko, is in the US Navy. Adam is out fishing in his boat, when suddenly ships started to blow up. Indeed, this bombing was the attack of Pearl Harbor, by Japan. If you are intrigued by Pearl Harbor or wars, I recommend this book for you."
3,A boy at war,I read the book a boy at war in about 3 days.It's about a boy named Adam and his friends Daviand Martin. One day Adam goes fishing inpearl harbor with his friends. They see all of theseJapanese planes flying overhead and bombing ships.Adam sees his dad's ship EXPLODE. Davi and Martin startcheering for the planes.(thet are both Japanese.)Adampushes them out of the boat they were in.Davi and Martinget hurt and have to go to the hospital. Then a sailor comes. Hethinks Adam is a sailor. So he takes him in to war.Eventually Adam escapes. Since this is an online review I can't tell youthe ending.It is a great book. I encourage people to read thisbook.It is one of my favorite books. And if you read it youwill like it too.
4,A Definitive Collection,"This disc is ideal for anyone who is curious about the Roman Catholic Cathedral just down the road from Westminster Abbey. It features music from all ages, all of which is brilliantly sung. Of course, since it covers such a broad range of styles, it is what I like to call a ""buffet"" CD- there's always a firm favourite item, rubbing proverbial shoulders with something less appealing. For instance, I am very taken by the Panufnik work ""Deus meus es tu"" but find such items as the Palestrina quite dull (although other works from that period such as the Byrd ""Ave verum"" are most arresting). On the whole, this disc is the definitive ""voice"" of Westminster Cathedral Choir, and it will be interesting to see what happens when director James O'Donnell takes over at Westminster Abbey in the new year. A broad mix of music that is good value for money."
2,LOOK at CONNECTIION,The car connection was female and the oem one was male sadly this one wasnt male thought of just splicing the old cennection to it but didnt want to deaL with it ... MAKE SURE ITS THE RIGHT CONNECTION !!!!!!
3,del sol o2 sensor,"Maybe I should have contacted seller,but pop up said it would fit my Del Sol, the pigtail was way too short, had to splice wires to make fit, but item was new and cleared my CEL. and great price."
1,American Greetings Creata Card Plus 4,I am unable to use it. It will not run on my Windows 7 platform and did not say soin the pre-purchase information. I would like to return it.
2,No Story about Foster Adoption,"I wanted to find a DVD to share with our family and friends about foster adoption. I was excited to find this DVD. However, once I watched it I was very disappointed. The description said that it showed a family doing a foster adoption but it did not. The first family had decided to adopt from Russia after going through infertility treatment. The second family did not have infertility issues and they do a private U.S. adoption but not a foster adoption. The first story is very good, we will probably just show our family that part of the DVD. Foster adoption as an option is left out of this DVD. For those interested a foster adoption is usually free to very little cost and is where parents adopt a child out of the foster care system in which case the child has been taken away from their family and put up for adoption by the state. Birth families have no rights to their child once a judge dissolves parental rights."
4,It's a great printer.,"The printer is a gem. Slow in relation to the old workhorse (which I hated to retire) the HP III, but on-the-whole, no slower than most other color printers.The only real problem I have had is that there was no User's Guide with the machine. Finding one has proven difficult. It is not on the install CD, and I am waiting for an answer to an e-mail note to the vendor.One document included in those that arrived with the printer speaks of an HP Photo Cartridge and Print Cartridge Storage container, but even the HP website does not recognize the part number.Aside from what I believe is inadequate documentation, if you are trying to get rid of all those clunky, large, old, single function machines, this is clearly the way to go. Less space and greater functionality are implied in the description. This is a multi-function device that works."
1,More of a troublemaker than any help,This printer barely gets XP support thanks to Microsoft and HP for not putting verifiable drivers. Another thing is this printer either doesn't take in paper even when you put it or it pulls in too many at a time causing more frequent paper jams. HP should be shot for giving us shoddy products !
2,card shop plus,"I recently purchased card shop plus from Amazon.com so that I caould do calenders for church but much to my disappointment the disc will not let me use the year 2011 even tho it shows me the option for 2011, 2012, and 2013.. it says it cannot find that year????"
1,disappointed--would not recommend,"This was probably high-tech in it's time, but Version 2 (maybe other versions) should really be taken off the market. It reminds me of a program of 10-20 years ago. I'm computer literate but don't have much patience with programs that are not intuitive. Options are limited and it's hard to use. I wasted my money on this one! Please don't do the same!"
3,I LEARNED SOMETHING !,This is supposed to be a read alone book . I had trouble with some of the words. I like it very much. Cute little cartoon -like characters all through the book. Very good science starter on human anatomy. Try to find it.
5,Nine confused people descend on Mcdonald with a vengeance,"This book was hilarious. Between Catarina's bad puns and the antics of Mickey, Minnie, and Bunkie, not to mention Ken, Harry and the gang, I was rolling on the floor. I must have the first book!!!! He must write a sequel!!!! More messed up people than the Mcdonalds I've never met. And this crew could scare and destroy the galaxy!YOu must read this book! Its great!!!!!"
2,The VMR Theory,"This items description said ""Only lightly used with minimal wear to cover and binding. A few pages may have small creases and minimal underlining."" It didn't say anything about the water damage on the lower part on the bottom corner of the back 50 pages or so. I DO NOT have time to reorder because this is a christmas present for my son."
5,"five stars, of course","At last, the most difficult of all bel canto operas sung by the only two divas of our time who could sing it. And sing it they did, they pulled off a true tour de force in Rossinian singing that may never be equalled."
3,Three stars is more than generous,"If the great Beverly Sills and Shirley Verrett had teamed up to record this opera, Joan Sutherland and Marilyn Horne would be left in the dust. Sills has a better trill than Sutherland does and her fioratura is more accurate than Sutherland's. When will Sutherland's sycophants see that Sutherland is small potatoes compared to the incomparable Sills?"
3,Great show but where is the ENGLISH DUB?,I love this show but why is aren't there english dubbing? This is becoming more common and I don't like it. The seems like a reasonable solution to series that might not sell as well but I have seen many slip through the cracks lately that would have been great with english dubbing.
1,Not able to play DVD,"The version of this DVD was not compatible with any of my PCs or laptops, which I guess explains why it was so cheap. I should have read more closely (if it was even listed anywhere), what operating systems the DVD worked on, but it was very old OS's that aren't even supported anymore. I can't use the DVDs so I can't rate the content."
1,Shallow Water,"This is a grossly dishonest work dealing with the historical Jesus. Herzog fails to credibly deal with the relevant NT textual matter not to mention addressing and genuinely interacting with scholarship that finds much more to the historical Jesus than Herzog's unplatable academic gruel indicates. He has very little to say about very much; one can thus wade through the shallow waters of Herzog's Prophet and Teacher never getting one's feet wet.Try the following for a good trip through the land of modern historical Jesus scholarship:Jesus and the Eyewitnesses: The Gospels As Eyewitness TestimonyDale G. ""Skip"" Wagner, Jr."
4,I Wanna Be Where You Are,The remake of this song was out of this world! Their blend of harmonies and tone compliment in every way. This is definitely Grammy/American Music Award material!
5,Just what I was looking for!,I got this book for my mother who was diagnosed with scleroderma 5 months ago. It answered questions that we hadn't even thought of yet. The chapters on finding the right doctor and getting information on the Internet were the best. This is a great resource.
1,Useless except for U.S. patients,"I found this book completely useless, although I suppose it may be helpful to U.S. patients. It seemed to me to be a catharsis for the writer, nothing else. As a patient suffering from scleroderma, I wasted my money, and the book ended up in the garbage after I had looked through it. I think it should be made clear that this is not helpful to patients or their families living outside the U.S."
4,Ballads,If you like ballads then I don't know of anyone who can sing them any better. This is a nice collection of his love songs that he sings well.
3,A Memory???,"The songs chosen for this disc were owned by the original artists who made them hits. Engerbert tried to buy them, but just did not have enough to make them his own. To me it was sort of Karoke--Engelbert was, in his time, a great crooner and he should rest his laurels on that--he was almost a great surgeon with his rendition of Stranger in Paradise, but he was a butcher on Unchained Melody, that was and is only the property of the Righteous Brothers. Thanks anyway for trying Engelbert."
3,Tiny,This dog is cut but is significantly smaller than the other one my granddaughter has. This one will sty at our house for when she stays overnight!
3,Beautiful But Flawed--the clasp doesn't hold,"since amazon doesn't provide a way to directly contact this designer, zina, i have had to take the bracelet to my neighbor who is also a phenomenal silver jewelry designer to see if there's any way he can improve the clasp. The bracelet is gorgeous, but it's fallen off my fiancee's wrist several times in the one month he's had it, and the last time we couldn't find it for an entire day, so he's not wearing it anymore until this gets resolved. i'm disappointed that it's so difficult to deal directly with zina, as i'm sure they are quality-oriented."
5,Pleasantly surprised,"If you like SOV horror films, this set is the way to go. The first fil, director Tim O'Rawe's THE BASEMENT (1989) sat unfinished for years. The shot-on-8mm production was then cobbled together by the producers and sound and dialog added. It's pretty raw, but also just unusual enough to keep your attention (It's available both on VHS and DVD in this edition). The other films in the set, especially the never-seen cut of MAMA's HOME are cheap, but good for a scare and a laugh or two. I consider this set a winner."
4,Great Set But...,"I was waiting for this release for some time. Very happy with the content, glad to own Video Violence 1 and 2 and the others. Cool retro VHS package. My only complaint is the DVD packaging. The way the 3 DVDs are stacked on top of each other really ticked me off. The top disc(disc 1) is so scratched I am gonna have to get it resurfaced. I am also going to throw the case away and get a different 3 disc DVD case..."
1,The only thing good aboutn these movies is the box,"when i read the previous reviews about how bad they were. My thought was they couldnt be that bad but i was wrong these movies are horrible. the quality sucks, the actors suck, and the voice over sucks too. the voices dont eve go with the people. i could barely watch one movie. the only good thing is the are work on the box and the red vhs tape. purchase at your own risk."
2,slower than expected,"I'm writing to see if less than positive reviews aren't deleted. I expected less polished videos. But, I expected more to be happening. I haven't seen all 4 videos yet. I was discouraged after seeing 2. If interested, maybe you can find parts of the movies on youtube. Then you'll be able to decide if you want to spend so much money."
1,***WARNING***,"These are AMATEUR movies---like home movies, or film school movies. I got duped by cool, box art and fake reviews. Amazon deleted one of the fake reviews, after I bought the DVD; it was a 5 star review made by someone who did not purchase the DVD on Amazon. Luckily, I did the ""free super-saver shipping"" thing, and was able to return the DVD for a refund.Notice that only 3 of the reviewers actually bought the DVD from Amazon. They rated it 5 stars, 2 stars and 1 star. That's an average of 2.7 stars."
5,GOOD PRODUCT AND GOOD PRICE,The drum works fine and the price is good. I received the item in 2 days without paying extra shipping. Thanks to the reliable seller.
1,UNINSPIRED AND BLAND WRITING,"The stories in this collection have little to do with plot, character development, and astute narration. Point of view is skewed in the narratives. There are no real endings. Ginseng and Other Tales from Manila is obviously Ms Villanueva's first attempt at publishing her bland writings to the world. Let us hope her type of inspiration does not provide the intelligent reading public with a second volume of novice prose."
1,In Operable to View: A Room with a View,"Well I never got to view it the film is a region 2 and all my components to operate the DVD are region 1.My fault didn't know any better and can't return it because it costs more then the DVD. So, now it willsit and no one here will enjoy it, a real shame. So looked forward to watching it a favorite film of mine.Do you have any solutions to situations like this?Amazon has always been reliable no other complaints, thanks."
5,"Passion, uncorseted , in this E. M. Forster story","Take two stuffy,repressed English ladies, pour them into gorgeous Florence of the late 1800's, throw in a few fiery encounters with the native Italians (amorous and/or violent), and watch for the ensuing combustion. Helena Bonham Carter loosens her hair and her heartstrings. Maggie Smith, my favorite character who is the chaperone, also learns a thing or two. The real stars arcing over this production, however, are ""bella"" Florence itself and the singing of Kiri Te Kanawe in the background, as she delivers her thrilling aria, ""O Mio Babbino Caro."""
5,"Breathtaking, romantic and funny!","It is rare that a film can be artistically beautiful, romantic, and at the same time be laugh out loud funny! It is one of my all time favorite movies. I will warn that there is a nude scene but it is not in a sexual context. So parents, if you don't wish your children to see as Archie Bunker once said 'full nudal frontity' :)don't watch this movie with kids. That being said, the dialogue is brilliant, the acting superb, and Lucy and George are two lovers you will champion from the beginning."
4,A Romantic Treasure,"The new DVD transfer looks great, especially the scenes in Italy. The film is unapolegtically romantic and often funny. What a pleasure to watch the stellar cast--Maggie Smith, Daniel Day-Lewis, Judy Dench, Julian Sands, Helen Bonham-Carter, Simon Callow, Denholm Elliot, Rupert Graves--they're all wonderful. The adaptation from the Forster novel is delightful, the score is charming. It should be watched alongside of Howards End and Maurice.I do agree that the extras are disappointing. I wish the cast had talked more."
1,A hammer to a Michelangelo,"Only someone on the payroll of Image Entertainment could have anything good to say about this DVD. As far as I'm concerned, they should be prosecuted for defacing a great work of art in their shoddy and careless transfer of one of the great films in English: it reminds me of that lunatic who took a hammer to the Pieta. Unforgivable."
1,TERRIBLE SOUND SO BUY THE BRILLIANT VHS,DVD SOUND WAS TERRIBLE. NO SUBTITLES. A SHAME BECAUSE THE FILM IS BRILLIANT. THE PRODUCER ALSO HAS A LOVELY COFFEE TABLE BOOK ON HIS COOKING ADVENTURES IN FLORENCE WHILE SHOOTING.BUY THE VHS.
5,Best Movie Ever,This is a timeless classic that one can never get enough of. I'm so happy it's in DVD!!! I have viewed this movie at least once a year for the past 12+ years and will never get tired of it. Bravo Merchant/Ivory.
3,A MUST-SEE MOVIE.,"""A Room With A View"" is a movie considered by many people as one of the best films ever made. So I decided to take a look to the movie, and even though I enjoyed ""A Room With A View"", and every minute gets more and more interesting, I really don't think that this movie can compare with ""The Godfather"", ""Casablanca"" or ""Ben-Hur"" as one of the best movies of all time.Anyway, the movie does have a lot of highlights: the cast is very good, the movie displays performances from nice actors, such as Daniel Day-Lewis, Maggie Smith and Helena Bonham Carter. The direction of James Ivory is outstanding, the photography, the set design, well everything is carefully designed.If you like period films, you will love ""A Room With A View"". If you want to see why this movie is so beloved, go ahead, watch it, you might love it. I don't think ""A Room With A View"" is a masterpiece, but you will at least enjoy this film, that's for sure."
1,I wanted to like it..,"I really did. I bought it with high hopes of liking it, yet i did not. I kept looking at the clock on my dvd wanting it to end. It started very slow for me and did not pick up at all. And i love period piece movies and have seen alot. This one did not do anything for me, except bore me."
1,Bad Region Code,Product was not compatible with my player. Makes no sense for Amazon to sell/ship product with incompatible region code to US/Canada. My inquiries regarding exchanging product for a region 1 version were never addressed.
2,Would of bought the movie only if......,Being a romantic and love old fashion movies I rented A ROOM WITH A VIEW after reading comments by other viewers. I watched the movie and it was a promising film. I had made my decision to buy the DVD before the end of the movie. That was until I saw the bathing scene. I'm not one to enjoy watching frontal nudity especially male frontal and I couldn't understand why it was added in the movie to beginn with. I'm still trying to understand it since it didn't seem important to the storyline. That scene destroyed the movie for me and I decided not to buy the movie after all. Should the scene not appear on the DVD or is removed from it in the future then I will consider watching the film again and probably buy it as well.
3,"Shallow story, content warning","There are plenty of reviews about the story, and it is a somewhat sweet love story. But it's also very shallow. I have not read the book, so maybe that gives a bit more insight into the characters and plot, but just as the movie is concerned, I was left wanting more. If you like deep characters, then you might be disappointed here.Also, a quick warning about content. Three men go bathing in a forest pond, all very innocent, but much nudity is shown."
1,WARNING!! ...FULL NUDITY IN THIS FILM!,"Unless you're a fan of seeing full grown men run around completely naked (full front and back) for about 5 minutes, don't watch this film. The rest of the movie is great, and this one scene completely ruins it for those of us who like to keep our minds free of these images. Disappointing to say the least."
2,"Five stars to the movie, two to this DVD","Any viewers who have a heraing-impairment, viewers who do not have English as their native language, or viewers that simply intend to watch this movie with a low volume-level, please be aware -- this DVD lacks both English subtitles and English Close Captioning. I had so looked forward to including this movie in my DVD library, but for some reason which is beyond me, the Image people were ignorant enough to leave out English subtitles/captions, rendering this film almost useless for me, and probably a lot of other people as well. All I can hope for is a Special Edition in the future, perhaps by another studio who takes the fine art of video production -- and us viewers -- more seriously.However, if you have no need whatsoever for English subtitles, then go right ahead and buy this movie. It's romantic, it's fun, it's wonderful, and you will not regret it (see other reviews for more indepth content commentaries...)."
1,DVD flaws,"I'll agree with the other DVD reviewers and add another failing that I noticed. Near the end, during the carriage ride with Ms. Honeychurch and her mother, the audio track gets a little out of sync with the picture for a couple of minutes. That, and the missing 40 seconds in the rather crucial scene in the Italian pension after the picnic, were things that bothered me the most. A Room With A View is my favorite movie of all time; I don't have to have special features on the DVD, like director's commentary or ""making of"" segments, though they would have been nice, but at the VERY least I expect them to actually give me the entire (!!!) movie without leaving bits out. Quite disappointing."
5,From Houston,"This is the best movie adaptation of any book that I have ever seen. It was made with a grace and accuracy that movies adapted after books today has not captured. I absolutly treasure this book, and this movie is one that I feel more and more satisfied with after each viewing. It also captures the Italian countryside and Florence with exceptional views."
4,Great movie,"My husband and I enjoy this movie very much and throw it in when we just want to have a nice, quiet evening."
4,A Room with a View,A Classic! For those whose spirit wants to break free of the constrictions that society holds them bound to. May you be inspired!
3,PAL master,"Sadly this was PAL Master transfer.So, running time is 112 min and frame is 1:1'85.But original was 117 min, and 1:1'66.(If you have Kiri Te Kanawa's Puccini CD... sounds different)This was not released from Criterion's Merchant Ivory Collection...That's the tradegy.So this is worth to get for Bonus disc.Very very sad... (about Ismail Merchant's sudden death too...)."
2,Wonderful movie; don't buy the DVD!,"This is one of my favorite movies, so I was excited to have my own copy. I wish, however, that I'd read some of these reviews first! This is the worst DVD I've seen: the video quality is horrendous and the audio isn't great. It looks and sounds as if someone digitized an old, shaky VHS tape and slapped it onto a DVD. My first viewing felt like getting stuck with Cecil when I'd been hoping for George."
2,It does not work,DVD would not work in any of my players even the new ones. It came with a little note in it that tells you you need new software to get it to run in most DVD players. I am returning it.
2,Poor quality,"This DVD is old and poor quality. I would like to return it, though I opened and viewed it. Any sellers should not sell such a poor quality product."
2,Not Very Believable,"I was surprised after watching this film, having read so many wonderful reviews I expected the romance and story to be wonderful when in fact it wasn't. For me there were no legs to the romance, it was just attraction as far as I could tell. There were very few actual scenes with the hero and heroine. George was a free spirit but lacked any depth and Lucy seemed generally confused and while this may have been the point there was never any growth towards her moment of truth it just happened. If you like beauty, the scenery and costume were great, but if you like story stay away."
3,Entertaining comedy of manners,"I expected much more from this movie having read rave reviews. The acting and cinematography are very good, but the plot is too simple and lacks depth. Nonetheless it is an entertaining movie with some hillarious scenes."
3,Good for one view,"Now, I own all three of the Merchant Ivory E.M. Forster movies. Of the three, this is my least favorite. It's the story of a young girl (Helena Bonham Carter) finding herself and her true love, despite missteps along the way. It's beaustifully filmed, and the music is lovely. However, it's just not as intertesting as the other two movies. It's a love story with a fairly predictable conclusion.Compared to Howard's End with it's many plot changes, and the absolutely perfect film Maurice, this film doesn't compare. I wish I had just borrowed it from the library or rented it for one viewing. I just thought since I liked the other two so much I would like A Room with a View, as well.However, I will say that I did not notice any of the problems the people who gave the DVD one star are mentioning. Perhaps the problems have been repaired."
2,An HD-DVD With Only a View,"There is so much to like about about the Merchant-Ivory production of A Room With a View that I couldn't wait to see it with all the detailed glory possible from an HD-DVD. But I wanted to hear it too, and alas, with this Warner/BBC version of the disc I could not: It does not have a Dolby or even a basic 2-channel soundtrack. Just DTS HD.Amazon had nothing on the site to warn of this. A sad oversight."
5,A classic! One of the most beautiful films made!,"I have owned this film on video for about 10 years now and I NEVER get sick of watching it. I own the soundtrack as well which is just gorgeous. What a completely perfect film. My favourite scene is where George Emerson is running back to the Pensione in the rain...ahhhhhh! On clear days I think of him in the tree screaming ""BEAUTY! JOY!"". This film endures, it is one of the most lovely films I have ever seen, if not the most lovely. It always makes me feel good to watch it, and it is so romantic!"
5,Very nice,"I like movies of this era, although sometimes I find the rules stifling. I enjoyed this very much and it left me feeling good. I will watch it again and feel I spent my time and money well."
4,Room With A View,"I watched this movie 8 years ago and loved it. The scenes taken in Florence, Italy were magnificent. The soundtrack was very good too. This movie got me started in watching the rest of the Ivory-Merchant productions. Highly recommended."
4,Perfect to someone new to opera & classical music,"If you think the album is romantic, check out the soundtrack. It's relaxing & melodic, & the arias from various operas are terrific.I'm no classical music or opera buff, but I don't find this at all intimidating, & enjoy it immensely"
4,VERY GOOD TRANSFER,THE BLU-RAY IS VERY VERY GOOD IN VIDEO ALSO CONSIDERING THE AGE OF THE MOVIE. THE ITALIAN EDITION ON DVD WAS UNWATCHABLE AND THAT'S THE REASON I BOUGHT THIS BLU-RAY. THE ONLY PROBLEM FOR ME IS THAT THERE IS NO ITALIAN LANGUAGE. THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION IS WRONG
1,What's up with the soundtrack?,"I have seen this movie many times, so I know what it should sound like. The audio in the disc is bizarre. The actors' voices sound like Mickey or Minnie Mouse--about two octaves higher than normal. It was disconcerting, to say the least.Do not buy this product. You will be disappointed, especially if you've heard the original soundtrack."
5,Love Letter to Florence,"This film - outside of being a great love story - is also a visual love letter to Florence. It sparked my trip last summer - alas I did not find my ""George Emerson.""But, it did kindle what I hope is a lifelong love of Italy - next year, Rome, Capri! Somehow, though, I think I will always come back to Florence. Eleanor Lavish makes a cogent statement when she says young Lucy is transfigured by Italy - and why should she not be? It happened to the gods! This dialog ran through my mind over and over again as I wondered the ancient streets, falling in love with everything I could take in with five senses: smells, language, music, sights.The other thing I absolutely loved about this film was Daniel Day-Lewis playing so against character as Cecil. Talk about a 180 from Last of the Mohicans, or My Left Foot for that matter. He is truly a master at the art of acting."
2,Terrible BD Transfer,"I bought the ""Special Edition"" BBC Video Blu-ray version that bears the following caveat: ""Due to the age and nature of the film, you may notice occasional flaws in the image and sound quality. Wherever possible, we have sought out and restored the original materials to ensure the best possible quality."" This is no restored version. The Blu-ray version was no better than a DVD version. I was terribly disappointed. Sony should guard it's Blu-ray reputation!"
2,Very disappointing second disk,"I am very disappointed in this two disk set. The packaging and presentation is excellent. The movie itself is of course, wonderful. Until now, I have always enjoyed any additional data added to DVD movies. However, the second disk is more than disappointing. I had high hopes of actor interviews and discussions about the lovely music selections and scenery in the movie. Instead, the second disk mostly contains bad morning-TV footage of the stars saying nothing of substance and very dull interviews of people who knew the author. The second disk is worthless - having the most inconsequential and unenjoyable addenda that I have seen on any DVD. Save your money, buy the movie DVD alone."
3,Wonderful movie--flawed DVD!,"Tragically, those reviewers who criticize the quality of the DVD transfer are correct. Not only is the sound a problem, there are odd deletions in the film (and I don't believe they reflect any late decisions on the part of the filmmakers). The early scene where Charlotte (Maggie Smith) tells Lucy (Helena Bonham Carter)after her kiss with George that ""we'll both be as silent as the grave"" is oddly truncated. Compare it with the VHS and you'll see. This absolutely wonderful film deserves a first-class DVD edition. Of course, it's still worth watching, but it's the one time I'd say opt for the VHS."
1,"Great Movie, BAD DVD","This is a very bad video to digital transfer that does not play in my DVD player. It is a pity that the company releasing this great movie has done such a poor job. Quality is grainy and the image does not sync up with the sound and is steppy. As much as I love this film, I would pass on this DVD."
4,Why are you complaining about the HD DVD on the Blu-Ray product?,I am highly annoyed when folks complain about one specific version or item on the WRONG item. This is the BLU-RAY item and everybody is complaining about the HD DVD. Two different things entirely!!!The movie itself is awesome - now all these crappy reviews are confusing to me because I feel that people don't understand the difference in the available technologies.
5,Ernie Haase Blesses Us Again,"If you liked the Cathedrals, you'll love Ernie Haase's new CD, Never Alone. Ernie (the tenor with the Cathedrals when they retired) does a range of song styles on this CD. 'I Love Piano' has a big band sound, 'The Ground is Level' has a country music sound, and he puts a slightly different twist to the song which has become his theme song, 'Oh, What a Savior.' Ernie's clear, crisp voice rings loud and clear on my personal favorite, 'The Blood Cried Out.' The words to this song say it all: ""...Hell has no hold on a sinner that's redeemed. For God So Loved the World and Calvary left no doubt. Release the prisoner came the shout, when the Blood cried out..."". ..., I highly recommend the song 'An Unexpected Cross.' Once again the words say it all: ""...So whenever you are forced to bear a cross you may not understand. ... ; I Love this CD! This is Ernie Haase at his best! ... ."
1,Avoid this product!!,This hard drive sounds like a washing machine and has terrible performance and reliability. Do not purchase this poorly made drive.
1,disappointed,"Initially my scanner worked quite fine and I was pleased with it...however, every time I signed out of it, it gave me an error message. I had removed the software on my computer and went to re=load it all....when i did my scanner Umax cd....it froze my computer up....I had no where to go for help. The place I bought my computer said "" you must have a UMAX"" and so you'll have to put in your ""start up"" cd. They said to contact You for help and you could give me an on-line down load to get my scanner to work again (since the cd is no good). I still don't know where to contact you...so I'm trying this and hope you read this and give me some information. I guess there's no use in having this scanner when it won't work with this cd. HELP"
3,"Love the 2100U, but NOT with WindowsME!","I have had a 2100U for a year now and would have given it a 5 star rating. When I changed to Windows ME, the scanner would still work, but an entirely different menu came up that was much less limited than the menue that worked fine on Windows98. UMAX has not been much help, but stated that the 2100U was compatible with updated software. I spent 2 hours downloading the software, but found NO improvement. Any one know how I can get the Advanced Menu to work with WindowsME?"
2,The hardware delivers but the software is horrible,"This scanner provides beautifull scans on my MAC G3 when it works, but the software is very buggy and causes serious system crashes (which were confirmed by ConflictCatcher). I called customer technical support and they said there was no cure."
4,Good but not the best,"I purchused it because it's very nice features, 36bit, up to 9600dpi, one touch scan, etc, at affordable price. However, the VistaScan software is a very bad program. It kept lock up the system or gives weird errors and I can't give go up higher than 1800dpi. I like the scanner, but I really wish UMAX could fix VistaScan's problems."
4,Very good quality; be patient w/bundled software,"This is a very good scanner at this price level, and thesoftware packages are really not all that bad as indicated by thefollowing complains.At first, I was very impressed with the quality of scanned photos and documents, but I was having some frustration customizing the software applications which came with the scanner. Well, the reason I was frustrated at first was because I was expecting the same level of user-friendliness you would find on other software such as WinFax, Microsoft Word, and Other popular commercial software. Well, I decided to spend some time and be patient to learn to use the software, understand the configurations and some try and error. I have now master the VistaScan (Beginner), Presto! PageManager, and the three push buttons.So, I can now scan the way I wanted it too, and the scanned result is very good. I am happy with it now after using it the second day! END"
3,Good scanner for older OS (win95/98/mac OS8),"Windows 2000 and MAC OS9 prove problematic.Windows 95/98 - Scanner worked well and was easily set-up.MAC OS 9.0 - Scanner installed and worked well but I cannot uninstall the scanner, when it is not connected the whole system crashes.Windows 2000 Pro - After 18 months I finally have this scanner working in windows 2000 it turns out that the umax software installs the driver file pv8630.sys into you c:\winnt\system32 folder, if you move this file to the c:\winnt\system folder your scanner will work. Umax support don't seem to be able to tell you this, which is very disappointing."
3,Use It On Older Windows OS,"Like some of the other reviewers, I tried to load the included software for this UMAX scanner on a new computer with Windows XP. And XP will not recognize the software at all. (Actually, I think this scanner's software was written for Windows 95??)So the only alternative as far as I can see is to load drivers from the Scanner and Camera Wizard if you use this scanner at all on XP. Of course you will lose a lot of the scanner's capabilities by doing this.Too bad, as it worked great on my old Windows 98 computer .....Such is progress?"
4,Very good scanner for the price,"This scanner is real cheap and works great, I've owned one for 2 years. The scanning software is very basic, but if you have Photo Shop or some off-shoot of it, you really can't beat this scanner for the price. I've used one's that are 5x as expensive and frankly can't tell the difference (they may be a little bit faster). It's not the fastest in the world, but it has worked fine for me for 100's of photos and even text documents. Regarding the 1st review on this page, if you have a crapy computer system that isn't sophisticated enough to run graphics hardware or software, you're going to have a problem no matter what."
4,Look to be quality product,"Actually haven't got to use this yet, but it looks well made, quality. I bought it for the smaller oven I use, as it only uses 12"" square pans. This one wouldn't fit, I think due to the top sides having that ""rim"" sticking out, so it was a tight fit and I couldn't close the oven door. So disappointed in that, but it does look to be a quality product, well-made. Will keep it for the day I get my larger oven fixed! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is it didn't fit my oven and I haven't yet got to try it, but 3 stars seemed too few since I'm sure it's a good pan."
4,Combat Proven,"We used these on a combat operation in Iraq. At first we were sleeping on the ground. Then we got the regular military cots. After getting attacked by bugs our supply ordered these.They are built though enough to withstand the rigors of combat.Yes the head space is a little low. However, we the wind is blowing 30 mph and we were getting hit hard by sand storms, I know the guys that had these cots slept a lot better than the guys that didn't.The cot offered better protection from the elements and bugs as well.The only two things I saw that we bad, is that they can get pretty hot if you have them closed. However, you can also use it as a mosquito net as well. Then also, did not fold up very small. Just folded into three sections."
4,Great but oversized one better,"I loved this idea and sleeping in it. I bought this for my son to use at scout camp to keep the bugs off him at night. Does a fantastic job. Used a self-inflating mattress pad under the sleeping bag for extra comfort. Folds up right inside the cot for storage if you don't get a really bulky one. The only reason I gave it a four and not a five is because of the extra advantages the oversized tent cot has - that one I'd give a five to... This one tips over if you get your weight too much to either end and not big enough to sit up in. Other than that, I loved it. GREAT IDEA!!!"
4,"Its a tent, its a cot.....its a tent cot!","We have friends that own two of these so had to buy one for our own use. The only thing I don't care for are the straps to hold the mattress flat. It makes for a bit of a rocking motion from foot to head. Other than that, very nice and easy to use."
3,ADD Adult,"There are too many books about ADD and ADHD that someone with ADD just can't get thru because we can't focus on reading step by step long winded instructions. This book has good practical advise, but it is a little like those other books. It doesn't hold your attention as well as the authors would like. I think books for ADD and ADHD individuals, should be available on audio CD's so that the people they are meant for will get more out of them."
2,shaven yak,The purchase of this product was for an adult Christmas gift. It was to remind him of one of his favorite shows.He thought it was great!
1,Product barely looks like the picture,"I purchased this as gift for a friend and was disappointed. In the web picture you see a clear contrast between the dark background and silver which is what attracted me to this item. The product that I received, however, had a barely filled 'gray' background instead of the rich black shown in the picture. Only when the shadows caught the item making it look dark, could you see some resemblance of what it's actually supposed to look like. So if this is any indication of the type of product quality this collection brings, stay away."
3,Excellent singing spoiled by poor direction,"The musical performance was excellent. However, instead of simply recording a performance, the director decided to be ""creative"" which resulted in a rather disjointed presentation.This would be better as music CD without the ""cute"" distractions of the video."
4,Wonderful,"This was my first ""Iolanthe,"" and I was totally captivated. Having been a professional dancer all of my life, the dance world really lost out on not having Arthur Sullivan compose ballet scores. ""Iolanthe"" screams to be danced, and in this production, much of the Fairies staging complies.The production, though a bit shaky at times, is a joy from beginning to end. The tongue in cheek campiness is just perfect. Wonderful sight gags abound, most memorable being the Fairies wings hangning out to dry before they are summoned by Strephon - hysterical.But!!!! It is the music and those AMAZING lyrics that just overwhelm you. It is truly a wonder that the human mouth can sing/speak at such lighting speed as required in the act one finale.It is simply wonderful."
2,Dull and unimaginative,"I found this performance lacking in many things but above all energy. This production clearly had severe budgetary constraints, but part of the magic of theater is the extent to which an imaginative director and an energized cast can overcome limits of production. That didn't happen here. While the individual cast members were splendid, the production as a whole never came together."
3,Fairies Adorn This Musical Play,"This is one of the better and more popular of Gilbert and Sullivan operas here in the States. As a Grad student at the University of Chicago, my eldest son was one of the major players and had a fine voice on his solo. His girlfriend, now wife, was one of the fairies and had back stage duties. She now has obtained her PhD in Theatre from LSU. I was recovering from a stroke when I was gifted with a free plane ticket to and from Chicago from Nashville to enjoy this classical production as performed on the campus Green. Hearing the PBS version brought back fond memories of that weekend and the nice taxi driver who did the impossible, got me to the stage on time. Jeff was great in his performance, and Christine tolerable. It was a cute thing."
4,great-poor quality,"great pin, i bought it for a freind who love cats, she like it...poor quality though..for price, it did the job"
4,Not for Users of Windows 98,"I purchased the first version of Dogz and was disappointed when I was not able to feed, treat, or play with my dog. I found out from Mindscape Help site that Dogz I is not compatible with Windows 98 (It says that it is on the case). Better get a later version and save yourself the headache."
4,Super Fun to Raise a Dog,I think this game is super fun! I really enjoy to take care of this computer dog and play with it. I love playing with the toys and the sounds the dog makes. The only problem is that sometimes you get bored of playing with your dog and on my computer it freezes all the time when I play it. I think this game is really great for people who don't have a dog. Because I think the dog is very realistic for a computer game. I think that adults and kids will enjoy raising this virtual pet. I sure do!
4,petz1,"Great game, but it's to bad you can only have one dog, and it doesn't always work on new computers."
5,Excellent Laptop!!!!,"I have this laptop since june of the last year....!!! I agree with the last review. I got the wrong HD but I write an email to gateway Customer support and they sent me the right one. I upgraded the memory to 1.256 MB and now works fantastic...The best thing that I couldnt find in other laptop the MP3 functionalitty y fantastic...!!! you only have to store your mp3 in the 2GB space (D Drive) and create your play list with the bluebird software and you have to turn off your pc, and then just press the power button on your AV Control Panel and Voila!!!Resgards,Ramon"
3,Proceed with caution...,"This release seems a bit of a desperate attempt at a compilation that the artist didn't have enough material for. I love TFF, but this CD, apart from a few select tracks, leaves you with tracks that are called ""remixes"" but are nearly indistinguishable from the album and single versions of the songs. The first track, however, is a great recent dancefloor filler reworking of the classic ""Shout"". This is an ""OK"" compilation, but buyers should beware though, this compilation isn't exactly what the title leads you to expect. If you are a TFF collector and/or completist you'll probably want this CD, otherwise, get the greatest hits compilation instead."
3,So-Called Best Of The Remixes,"Well, this one is really different, I'd say the hardcore collector would get this but if I was just a common fan, I'd pass on it, read all the reviews here and a bit late reviewing it since when I got it originally it was around 20 + dollars. This would have really been good if it had just original remixes on it, OK maybe one or two are near original but really, why say it is ""The BEST of the remixes"", it really is not. If you really want a great remix album (a double too) seek out the Philippines remixes CD (This one is the real deal on remixes) which has become quite rare, really worth it over this one. Anyway, this one is just OK with me but I'm a collector and had to get it. Check out my website sometime and give me a visit at ""Judemac Forever"", google it."
3,for serious fans indeed...,"i kinda notice that there was only one very encouraging review for this cd, that of antonio cruz. laurent of australia may have a point here. it is indeed quite expensive and too close for comfort from the original album/remix version.but then again, as cruz have said, money is no object for the serious fans of tears for fears. i should know, i went all the way to atlanta, georgia to join a bidding for a very rare 4cd demos and remix compilations of the group. it cost me a fortune but i diddn't mind at all. after all, i am not just buying a group's effort. i am also buying a part of history i grew up with.my $50 suggestion is, if you have the moolah, go splurge on this one. if you don't, wait 10 more years when they start playing these tracks in a vintage show dedicated for 80's pop greats. your choice..."
5,Great buy,I am very happy with yall guys and from my family i would like to say thank you for all your help i will make sure to tell everyone to buy from yall all...
4,A Window into the Heart and Mind of Today's Individuals,"In this day and age of quick fixes and appearance over character, addictions are becoming more and more widespread. The author here describes the process of addiction, including addictive relationships. He then breaks down the addictive process into three stages: internal change, lifestyle change, and life breakdown. Following the addictive process, he shares the motivations for recovery. He closes the book by addressing addiction as it relates to families.This work will apply to any addiction -- it is not restricted to just one variety. I recommend it for all Christian workers, particularly pastors. It will give a greater glimpse into the emotional struggles of the people all around a pastor, as well as a much-needed window into his own heart and mind."
5,Helped me to understand what I was dealing with,"This book was recommended to me by my husband's sex addiction support group leaders. I found it very helpful in understanding how the addiction controlled his life, feelings, actions, and decisions. I actually bought this copy for a friend so she could more clearly see what was going on in her marriage. If you have an addiction or a relationship with an addict, it is an excellent book to get better understanding with. Being armed with knowledge, a person is better prepared to make the decision as to whether or not to stay in the relationship. I eventually chose to leave the marriage, because the patterns didn't change, and with the knowledge I gained from this book and others I was able to see the dead end I was in."
5,Incredible Read,"This book was incredible, even life changing and very informative. At times I found it hard to put this book down."
4,To the point!,I would definately recommend this book for anyone that wants information without having to read hundreds and hundreds of pages. Very imformative.
2,Not if you are looking for recovery help...,"This book is more like a theoretical exploration of what promotes addictive behavior, and will be of no real help to you if you are trying to help (or are yourself) an addict. There is no exploration into what treatments will work or not work, and some of what he says doesn't really seem to make sense in a real-life situation. Overall, it's useless unless you are curious about what might (theoretically) cause addictive behavior."
3,No such thing as an addictive personality,Unfortunately this book suffers from concept reduction. That is it takes a common sense understanding of what addiction and the addictive personality is and conflates the two and argues that the latter is real. Compulsive behaviour is not the same as having an addictive personality. All research that has tried to find an addictive personality - using a concept that isn't so broad as to include any compulsive behaviour - has failed to find consistent and predictable personality types that enable us to usefully labal it as such. That said the book may have good practical use for many people - it's just that the way the author conceptualises what it is that people have is not supported by the scientific evidence.
2,Class Assignment,"I had to read this book for my college course. Most of the people in the class did not like it or agree with many of nakkan's viewpoints. I personally think he is repeating NA to us in his own words. if you are not into NA, yo will not like this book.Nakkan states abstinence is the only way to recovery, I beg to differ with him, there are many successful treatment modalities that do not include total abstinence such as methadone and methadone maintenance. Also, Naltraxone for those that are in disagreement with MMT. how about Antabuse? That is medicinal, he also thinks that is not ""real recovery"" then because it is medication assisted recovery?Did not like this book or his opinions."
3,Not the Best,"The one thing I've learned about Omoumi's style and recordings is that you hear too much forced breath, often giving a dry timbre to the ney; you can hear the air forcefully beeing blown into the instrument. It sounds like when you have hair on your lips and you ""poof"" it away. I've heard other ney players who avoid that style and the sudden rough sound. And, on this particular album, the ""zarbi"" sections aren't as fast as one expects them to be. Zarbi of the mode Homayoun is more beautiful when played faster than this. His ney speaks of sorrow and even bitterness. I prefer neys which speak of passion and love."
5,THIS FLCL CD ROCKS!!!,"Ever since I purchased this CD, I can't stop listening to it. The music from the Pillows is extraordinary, as well as the anime itself. My only concern is that some of the tracks are too short. But other than that, it is a brilliant soundtrack with lots of instrumental pieces. I can't wait for the next FLCL CD to arrive in the United States."
3,Their albums are better,"This soundtrack fit the anime very well, and not having vocals in a lot of the songs was more appropriate in this context, but a lot of songs on the soundtrack actually have vocals to them which are awesome and make the music a lot better, and those who only hear the soundtrack are missing out.If the cost of importing their albums is the issue, buy this, since its now a domestic release, and scrounge around on *emule* or an equivalent until their albums are released here.Imported, they're just not worth it ($40+) unless you have plenty of cash to throw around."
5,FLCL Fooly Cooly,It is the best sound track put out for any Anime show! I recommend it with the DVDs of that show.
4,"Pillows rock!, but this CD could use a little help.","First off, if you're reading this, you know the pillows are brilliant. Their virtues are unquestioned, and their songs are wonderful alternative/pop punk bliss. They've brought me musical joy, even if it's from half the world away. However, I have to agree with the other reviewer about the sound quality on this CD. Played at slightly less than normal volume, it sounds fine, but upon cranking it (like any fan of the pillow's music would), it does sound like compressed mp3s. Or something between normal CD quality and a brand new cassette tape (with no hiss). It's kind of a downer, and it takes a little getting used to. However, if that's the price we pay for a cheap domestic version of the FLCL OST, then I'm all for it. By the way, this may just be a rumor, but keep your eyes open for a domestic release of OST 2 sometime this fall..."
3,Fails in the most important area,"This phone looks nice, setup is easy and most of the features work well. However, it fails in the most important area -- talking on the phone. It has this feature where when you talk, it quiets the person on the other end, and then the sound gradually comes back over a couple seconds. So if you say something or even make any noise while the other person is talking, it basically silences the other person for several seconds, making it impossible to carry on a decent conversation.It's not designed very well for holding the phone with your shoulder... if you try to hold it with the earpiece next to your ear so you can hear, then you end up accidentally hitting buttons. If you hold it any other way, you can't hear anything.Also, the speakerphone is useless. I couldn't hear anything at all out of it, though the person could hear me.It's going back to Target today."
3,Last Year's River,I was hoping for so much more than this book turned out to be. Enjoyable but nothing profound.
4,This year's downer,"I enjoyed this book, but expected more from it than I got. The characters were well developed but seem to sleep walk through the story. There was no real heat between the main characters, they seemed to seek each other out for warmth and comfort not because they truly cared about each other, which is OK, I guess, if you're into that sort of thing. Some of the scenes in the book were brutal, like the West is (was) back then. But the characters seemed to hold back their emotions from everyone, including us."
5,Just... Fantastic! It makes me weep.,The extra cuts are great too. Some of Mike Scott and the boys' greatest works. I can only say... wow. You've got to see them do this live with Steve Wickham on fiddle... BRILLIANT.
2,Better buy a lot of these if you need more...,"Unfortunately, none of the rope light manufacturers have agreed on a common connection size, so if you need an extra length of rope lights, you can't mix it with another brand...the connectors won't fasten. If you have a long run, be sure to order plenty from the same brand...and then some."
3,Not very hardy,"I used this to run Cat 5E through my house, about half way through the job the metal rod (or tape) was bent to the point where it wouldn't even go fully into the plastic ring. This product is ok I guess and will get the job done."
4,My child loves it,"I got this toy for my 15 month old last Christmas. The she liked shaking the blocks and pulling them apart. Now that she's 2, she likes to put them together like puzzles and use them as beds for her dolls. She finds new ways to play with them every day. Definitely worth it."
2,Can't find a use...,"Neither of my kids liked this product. It just seems so useless.Even though is says the blocks can be put into water, this just causes a big mess."
2,FREAK DOG,"Kevin is a creepy morgue attendant and outcast who is shy and stutters. He has made a video of med students appropriating some party pharmaceuticals. They invite him to drink and party with him under the guise that if he participates, he won't tell. Turns out Kevin is a bit epileptic and ends up in a coma as the kids dump him off at the hospital and run.Catherine (Arielle Kebbel), the girl Kevin had a crush on, feels guilty and attempts to revive him with an experimental drug...one that stimulates the brain which happens to be the part of the brain which gives people out of body experiences. Soon people in the click are brutally murdered.Okay, the killer is a guy in a coma. It was a bit of a yawner. For some reason the film lacked intensity.F-bombs, brief sex?, brief corpse nudity, Arielle Kebbel,Sarah Boyd-Wilson bra/panties"
2,Incorrect information,"I bought this atlas several months ago, and loved it. However, I just discovered a major mistake on page 6: Birmingham is listed as the capital of Alabama. (I checked elsewhere to make sure that the capital had not moved from Montgomery.) If this basic information is incorrect, it makes me wonder how many other errors exist, and if I can trust only the information that I know from other sources. Very disappointing!"
2,Outdated finance with a touch of humor,"Financial advice from a guy who owns 17 oil wells. I saw this book in a $1 store, and bought it mainly for the title and the author's rather funny style. BUT it was written in the 1970s, so the financial advice (why not to buy gold, etc.) is badly dated. Still, some things (his reaction to the first-time introduction of disposable razors and his worries about the environment) are really worth reading from a historical standpoint. he profiles famous men and women of finance (including a blind female stock-market whiz billionaire, and a male scammer with a pyramid scheme who made a mint and was never arrested) and comments on then-timely issues such as the battle over the King Kong remake between Paramount and UNiversal. At the end of the day, this is a book for history buffs, and people who want to trace the roots of today's financial crises. But if you're looking for How-To-Expand-Your-Portfolio, this is not it. Strictly historical/anthropological value."
3,"Product OK, but it's NOT Deluxe Edition","The picture doesn't corresponds to real product. But, the CD is OK.A great work from this band from Israel, Orphaned Land."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"This is not a book you want to buy if you are researching the actual history of the cowboy era. If, however, you want to read a somewhat sarcastic history of how the cowboy has progressed in the minds and media of America, from old Westerns, to Marlboro Man, to ""country"" music, then this book is for you!"
5,Pancreatin is a life saver for someone without a galbladder,"This pill is absolutely great! I have had issues with digestion for many years. I have had galstones for many years and finally had my galbladder removed about a year ago. Well, I still had issues digesting certain foods and issues with gas. I used to use a combination of lactaid (I'm also lactose intolerant) and gas pills to try to combat the problem, but it only helped mildly.This pill took care of the problem for me. My stomach no longer rumbles after a meal. I wish I had found this sooner, and the same brand's pill Dairy Digest. They are simply amazing and worth every penny. In my opinion, these are better and cheaper than the junk I had bought in the past."
5,My three year old enjoys it,"My three year old son watches this frequently in the car and it keeps him interested. He laughs at some parts and he repeats many of the spanish words. He will even ask to watch ""pim"""
5,Saw This On Dr. Oz,I have moved from Olive Oil to this now. It is light and no heavy after taste. It also helps you not to gain weight and I used it in all of my foods when it calls for oil. Very good product! Love it!
2,Wonder if I got a bad batch,"I have used rice bran oil before that I purchased through Williams & Sonoma and it was great: light, clean tasting and almost no smoke at high heat.This is not the same stuff. I tastes fine but smokes like crazy even at medium heat.I wonder if I got a bad batch."
2,wrong but right,This item is mislabeled. The company says it is legal to do so. It is labeled as 12 oz. but is really 64 oz. (I guess).
4,2 little girls in the Selma civil rights movement,"A moving as-told-to account of the experiences of 2 brave little girls in the days of the Selma civil rights movement. As adult women, they recall their involvement as children in the stirring church meetings and the marches, their relationship with Martin Luther King Jr., and themurders of 2 white Northern clergyman. Stirring, inspirational, deeply moving."
3,Brave Mickey Rescues the Princess Minnie,"This is a fun little story about Mickey Mouse on a quest to save Princess Minnie from the evil clutches of Malgar the Magician. Mickey first meets up with the Old Woman of the Woods who tells him how to get a magic cape (and later gives him two magic cabbages). With the help of his cape and the magic cabbages, Mickey saves Minnie (yay!) and the evil Malgar (boo!) is turned into a donkey. It's a basic ""Damsel in Distress"" story, but it's fun to see Mickey and Minnie in the lead roles."
5,Go to Wal-Mart,"I can't vouch for the BestAir product, but Wal-Mart carries Sunbeam Bacteriostat in it's stores for $3.24 for a quart."
3,BT Humidifer Bacteriostatic,Could have purchased this for a lot less and would not have had to pay shipping. But I tried it and it is just ok. Would not buy again.
3,"Works good, but . . .","I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now. When I first started up my humidifier for the season there was still a little bacteria odor even after cleaning. I added this product and after 3 or 4 days there is almost no detectable bacteria odor.I would give this product 5 stars, except that I haven't been using it long enough to be sure. And there may be a problem with it foaming, and causing some problems with my humidifier.I'll try to remember to update this review.Update 2-13-13It does foam too much in my humidifier. This causes an annoying snapping sound in the humidifier. Like the bubbles bursting, except louder and sharper. Nothing terrible, but I have to run the humidifier on low to stop it from making that annoying noise. Can't run it on high anymore. The sound is more like mild electrical arching, and I wonder if the foam is getting into the electrical controls at the top of the unit."
2,Did not work for me,"I don't know what the deal was, but this stuff made my filters go bad much faster than just using regular tap water. I used it in a vornado humidifier. Would not buy again.Also, when the product came in the mail, it was not packed well and had leaked in the box."
5,Well pleased,This item worked very well in preventing the build up of contaminants in my humidifier. I use it regularly in both my humidifiers.
3,Works but not best $ value,"Unfortunately, you add shipping cost into the product purchase this item is too expensive. I now go to my local Walmart and for a comparable product and save the shipping cost."
4,works fine,"The product was delivered timely for a reasonablyshipping fee, and works as expected. I will buy it again."
3,Good product sloppy delivery,"A good water treatment is a must for humidifiers. This fills the bill. However, the shipping department wasn't awake the day they sent this bottle. There was no cap on the bottle and the only thing holding in the product was the safety seal. Luckily the product did not travel by air."
4,Response,"What can I say, it's a bacteria fighting agent, it does what's it's supposed to. No complaints humidifier works fine."
1,dangerous for your skin? How is it supposed to be good for your lunges?,"I wasn't aware that this product is so dangerous for your skin that you have to wear gloves because it will harm your skin and there are several warnings about its dangers on the back. I don't believe that something that goes in your air humidifier and therefore in the air of your home should be so harmful, because I'm sure it can't be healthy for your lunges. I used it one time and won't use it again, also because I don't want to have to be worried that it gets in contact with my skin, what if the water spills and I don't notice and someone steps in it? Would you want your family, friends or children or even pets to get in contact with a poisonous solution without knowing?"
2,Doesn't seem to do much,"I haven't really seen any evidence that using this product actually does anything. My filters still get mildewy and the water, if left sitting for more than a day or two, does the same. I suspect bleach would actually work better and be a much cheaper option."
4,Great Review Book,"This book was key to passing boards!!! I did not use the book to memorize test questions, but help me direct where I needed to focus my studying. I took every test in the book and I recognized repeated questions for all sections, except the dental anatomy and occlusion. Even so, the book was still beneficial because it did help me see where I was weak and needed to put more time in my dental decks. Overall, it was a great guide and great tool that helped me pass part I boards."
4,Great book,I felt this book was very helpful for a party that I catered. The book has detailed pictures and is not only good for parents but it can also be used as a source to keep kids occoupied. I had used some things in the book when I had my kids set the table. It is a fun and good bookI also Recommend Napkin Folding by Linda Barker.
4,Nice but....,"Nice pair but not as concave as shown but pretty flat MOP. Also, the post was short and thin. The posts need to be long for a secure pair of earrings."
3,FUN!,"I truly enjoy this game. To be honest the graphics aren't the very best and the gameplay is lacking, BUT the realism is makes up for it. It's fun just to fly around and blow up your own air base! The missions themself are entertaining and quite challenging. A-10 with a good joystick (a must) is a classic"
1,Dont waste your time or money,"I was very much disappointed in Benefiance Pure Retinol Instant Eye Mask. I have used all 12 packs over a period of 4 weeks, as directed and I saw not one difference in the wrinkles (even the smallest ones)around and under my eyes. Once on, the patch dried out very quickly and I never felt my eyes looked any different regardless if I used it in the morning or right before I went to bed.VERY DISAPPOINTED"
1,A waste,"I did not like this movie at all and thought it was a waste. My hubs, however, thought it was funny."
3,Strange Movie,"I love Ryan Gosling but found this movie hard to navigate. It jumps from the present to the past with no warning and it is quite confusing. Some may find it interesting, but I did not."
2,Fooled by the Trailer....again,"Not at all the movie I expected based on the trailer. Gosling is excellent, as a smarmy psycho. Durst is sexy white trash; The first half of the movie held my interest, but as their relationship peters out and becomes more dysfunctional my interest waned and I actually fell asleepThe wrap up ending was completely unfulfilling. The story it told as if it is based on some truth, but if it is, it has never reached my perception.Not worth the trip to theatre."
2,Why make a movie about him?,"SPOILERS SPOILERSThis is a story about a man who isn't a suspect in his wife's disappearance and he's also found not guilty of murdering some other guy. It would be an interesting story if there was strong evidence showing he was guilty of these crimes and was still found not guilty, but no proof is provided in this movie. So this movie is about an ordinary man."
2,don't bother,don't bother buying this one. not worth the money. should have red boxed this for a dollar instead. do not recommend this.
4,all good things,"this is a very good movie, based on a true story. ryan gosling and kristen dunst did a very good job ."
3,Would like better endings,I just wish movies would have more defined endings now. It seems that it is in vogue to leave a hanging ending.
2,Really!?!,"Shallow, manipulative, and uninspired retelling of a true story. Frank Langella was excellent. Dunst was beautiful. Otherwise . . . not worth the time."
3,"This was OK,","In my opinion, this movie left so much out. And it is rather disappointing that the stories are quite different. Still, this was not a bad movie. As others have said, the first half is the better half. I fail to see the fuss over Ryan Goslin. He was horrible in this movie and as far as I know, I have never seen him in anything else and never heard of him before seeing this flick. Kirsten Dunst alwasy seems to bring her A+ game even when the scripts are lame.The movie could have been much better if they would have just left the ""true"" story disclaimer out and brought it to a solid end. After Katherine's disappearance, the movie falls flat on its face and makes no sense at all. No attempts to revive it were made."
3,creepy,"creepy movie. it's hard to believe that it's based on true events. i urge you to go to wikipedia and read about the real story. such a contrast to the glammed out movie. there was nothing glamorous about the real events. in the end, the whole thing just felt yucky and scary. not for the faint of heart. i gave it three stars because i don't like scary flicks, and i didn't realize that it was going to be so creepy. also, it makes me wonder how and why hollywood sensationalizes events in history when the actual events are sad, gruesome and just plain awful."
3,It's okay,I don't want to see Ryan Gosling in a role like this. this movie is kind of dark. It's just ok
3,Movie,"It is a depressing movie, but also a true story. I have read the book so I could follow along."
3,Worth watching for Kirsten Dunst's amazing performance,"This is a tricky film to review, because it was based on a true story, and the writers / directors / editors chose not to veer far from the historical narrative.In short, this means the last quarter of the film is a bit of a weird mess, unless you (the viewer) have taken time to learn about the real-life events first.Ryan Gosling's character was flat and odd throughout; perhaps this was on purpose? In any event, this movie does not leave me impressed with his acting skills.Kirsten Dunst, on the other hand, is marvelous. She makes this a movie worth seeing. Frank Langella is also awesome in his role."
4,Wow,Wow. This was really great. I rented it without knowing much about the plot but the story was very compelling. Great cinematography and performances. Highly recommended.
1,Slow and boring,At least I didn't pay for the movie but I would like the two hours of my life back. It was slow and played like a lifetime movie. Kirsten Dunst's performance was good but I kept waiting for the movie to pick up and it never did. It should have just been on one of those hour long murder mystery news specials - they might have made the story more interesting.
2,Ok,This movie was okay. A little slow and not a lot of detail. Ryan Gosling did not shine like he usually does.
4,Ryan Gosling man crush,"You'd think a movie staring Ryan Gosling AND Kirsten Dunst would have the potential to be a really slow, little dialogue snooze fest, but the story of this movie is able to carry it well. Since it's a bit of a murder mystery based on a true story makes it really intriguing. I'd say give it a go and if it moves too slow for you then just turn it off since it's on Prime Instant which should be costing you none extra."
2,Blah!,"Both great actors, story was boring, kept waiting for it to get going, never did. May have been the editing, confusing most of the time. I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Good movie.,"Good movie. Although I was surprised in the end to find out that justice wasn't served. But I can understand why. If the movie was based on a true story.... then, that's how it plays out sometimes in the real world."
4,Interesting movie,I bought this movie to watch on the airplane and it kept my interest for the whole flight. Excellent performances.
2,My main reaction........,Painfully slow! I watched the movie out of boredom and it made me even more bored. I would have had more enjoyment cleaning the bathroom.
3,Just OK,"Having read all the positive reviews, I was a bit disappointed. Moved kind of slow. I kept waiting for something to happen that never did."
2,"ANDREW JARECKI, OPUS 2","Here's a perfect unbalanced film. Kirsten Dunst's character and, above all, performance totally eclipses what's left of All Good Things. As soon as she disappeared from the story, I wanted to go outside for a walk (and, believe me, that was a courageous thought considering the pouring rain we have here but I wander from the point). Already forgotten. Unfortunately."
4,Thumbs up!,This movie has a great cast was well acted! It is definitely worth watching. I also love that it was based on a true story.
2,"Good acting, but very boring!!!","If you're looking for a suspenseful movie, don't look here. The acting is good, but there is no suspense because it's slow character driven drama that is base on murder that doesn't unfolds until the very end of the movie."
2,"Slow, Dull","The fact that it's a true story makes it interesting alone - but the plot line, the music, the build us is unfortunately off in a variety of ways. I really wanted to like this movie, but didnt. As a movie, it just falls short. The characters needed a bit more development and the casting was just not as good as it could have been. Kristen Dunst does a good job - but really the movie (and story) is bizarre, so even her acting couldnt pull this movie out."
4,Solid,"I rented this not knowing exactly what to expect. What I got was a really interesting plot, greatly acted characters and some twists I didn't expect. My only disappointment was the ending ***spoiler*** I could NOT believe he got away with it all! All in all, an interesting watch."
5,Lots of twists!,Enjoyed this movie very much. Kirsten Dunst did an awesome job. I was pleasantly surprised with all of the twists and turns in the movie which kept me on the edge of my seat.
1,Lame,"Ryan Gosling just stands there. A turnip could play his part. Dunst is, as always, beautiful but has a rough time playing off the stone gosling. The only saving grace is that they know how to get the most out of Dunst's lovely face and to die for body. Once she disappears at about the 60 minute mark turn it off. It's down hill from there."
2,Could have been so much better,"There seemed to be gaps between key events that left us thinking 'huh?' The characters have little depth, even the main ones by Gosling and Dunst. It's too bad, the story and the cast had such potential..."
1,Not much of a surprise,"It could have been done in a more interesting way. It was slow going and predictable. Innocent girl meets wounded man, falls blindly in love, and he turns out to be the classic man who hasn't dealt with his own emotional scaring. I find it disturbing to be a true story, but in hindsight I felt that with different people writing the script and/or directing that it could have been more intense and suspenseful."
1,Yawn...,This was one bad movie...a-list actors relegated to b-movie parts...WHYThe only thing that kept this movie watchable was Kirsten Dunst
3,Nothing Special,"Having previously read about the case on which the movie was based, I ""went into it"" with a pretty good familiarity with the ""storyline"". While the movie stayed fairly consistent with the actual case facts, there was nothing special about the movie's presentation of these facts. The ""play"" was actually rather mediocre - and overly long. As far as the actors, unlike many of the other reviewers on this site,I was UNimpressed with Gosling's ""wooden"" portrayal of the mad, cross-dressing murderer; I normally like Gosling - but in this movie, he just didn't deliver a believable character - unlike his costars,Dunst & Langella, both of whom provided credible performances. I have rated the movie overall as a ""3""- viewing it contextually (since I didn't pay anything to watch it as comparable to a ""TV movie"". Had I been required to pay for its viewing, however, I probably would have rated it a ""2""."
4,Really quite good!,Completely surprised at how good this movie was! We couldn't find anything to watch and I'm a fan of Ryan Gosling so we rented this one. I'd recommend it for sure.
4,All Good Things,"very enjoyable, like a good book you cant put down, you sit in wonder as to how it will end"
4,Intriguing crime drama and mystery,"It seems pretty clear what happened to the woman in this true missing person (murder?) case, but I will not say too much more about that. Gosling and Dunst do a great job as the two leads in this story of a married couple whose relationship unravels during the 1970s. I wish there had been a bit more about the investigation and related issues, but for the most part this is a fascinating story."
1,very good text book,"It is a very good text book, but the pictures would be colored. Color pictures are important for the patologist veterinary and for the students."
4,member of the band,"i am one of the founding members of janitor. basically what you are getting here is a discography consisting of 3 seperate 7"" records (two of which were never released). obviously i am biased having wrote the thing but i could not give it 5 stars even though i personally love all the songs. hardcore punk at this speed is meant to be taken in small doses - hence releasing 9 songs at a time. here you get it all in one sitting (27 songs in 25 minutes) and making it even more intense than we planned it. we had a great time recording this stuff and, as music fans, we feel lucky to have it available."
2,Very average,I really dig Wendy&Lisa.Prince needs them badly.but this disc didn't seem like it then.this was pretty much run of the mill Paisley outtakes.they gave Prince color in his work and gave his work a Freshness but there was a reason why he was the Leader.this disc shows why they were better behind the scenes.but Fruit at the Bottom changed all of that.Waterfalls was a cool song but Nobody had any idea How tight these Women were until the other albums Emerged and they continued to Grow while Prince fell off big time.but this Album didn't show how Important they were for Prince's Revolution.
1,CD plus brand new Wendy & Lisa site,"The only song that I like on this cd is ""Waterfall"". The second best is ""Honeymoon Express"". The Eroica cd has more songs on it that are commercial sounding. For those of you who are interested in information about Wendy & Lisa, you will have to check out a hot new site. This site reveals shocking information about Wendy Melvoin. You won't want to miss this!Click here!"
4,<FUNKY DIVAS>,"When you learn from a musical prodigy like Prince, you learn how to craft great music, hence Wendy and Lisa. I was quite impressed when this came out and it still brings back some wonderful college memories. It's a little funk, jazz, blues, and pop all wrapped into one kewl CD!One of my favorite songs is the dreamy and flowing ""Waterfall"". I also like ""Honeymoon Express"", ""Stay"", ""Blues Away"", and ""Chance to Grow"".These two talented musicians shined like stars on their debut. Prince certainly had to be proud!"
4,"over 10 years later, this is still a must have!","I can't believe I'm not the only person who remembers this album. To see others reviewing it 12 years after its release is mind-boggling. I bought this when I was 16 years old, and to me that was long ago. Needless to say I misplaced it along the way. But after catching myself singing ""Waterfalls"" in the shower, I wondered if it was still available to purchase. And sure enough it was. This was one of the best recording of the late 80's. I'm not one for 80's music, but I will admit to loving and re-owning this one. Who was that guy Wendy and Lisa used to be in a band with? Don't remember him, but I definately remember these two. The point is: BUY THIS CD....YOU WANT BE DISAPPOINTED!"
2,so-so,"nothing really special outside of waterfall.there better work lies ahead.this was an album to just get there feet wet.they had just left prince and the around the world in a day,parade and sign o the times vibe was felt on this album.very spotty album but it shows a duo with talent."
2,Too tight!,"Hanes ankle cut socks are my sock of choice most of the year, however in the Iowa winter's I like to have my socks go a bit higher. Therefore I tried these crew socks by Hanes. I have run across the ""Hanes Dry"" socks. These are the ones I am reviewing here...Most of the time I am wearing tennis shoes and on my feet for work, I also like to go walking - it was bothersome to me that some days my feet would sweat. My feet would actually feel hot & moist in my shoes - how uncomfortable!!When I saw the ""Hanes Dry"", I immediately put them in my cart! They work great! I do not have that 'hot/moist' feeling as much as before. Yes, I still get that, but only after a very long, warm day. On my average/normal days, these socks keep me dry, however they are WAY too tight for my legs! I am of average size and I bought the socks that are made for my size feet.While the ""dry"" works great - these crew socks are too tight. I recommend the ankle cut socks over these.- 1smileycat :-)"
1,I have seen better,When I got this game I compared it to talonsoft's worldin flames. I thought that the graphics were bad and unrealisitc.The grapics appear 2-dimensional and cartoon like. The sound effects could be better. You can creat scenerios. However the game does not allow you to write any descriptions on them. If you want a more realistic game I would reccomend World In Flames.
5,Great Buy,"Wonderful buy I got this upon hearing the very sad news about Ronnie James Dio and his death rock and roll will never be the same again, but the seller was great and very fast shipping. I would definetly reccomend this seller"
2,DO NOT buy this unless you like LIVE GARBAGE!,"What happened to the good original Ronnie James Dio videos. Hello, the originals are his best.... This collection is junk for those who hate LIVE stuff. With live you never get the REAL DEAL."
2,REGRETTABLE ASPECTS OF THE 'MASCULINE' PERSONALITY,"John StoltenbergThe End of Manhood:A Book for Men of Conscience(New York: Dutton, 1993) 311 pagesStoltenberg criticizes the regrettable aspects of the conventional'masculine' personality, such as being macho, violent, tough, insensitive.He believes that these are false images put upon men.And if they will tune-in to their 'true selves',something wonderful will emerge.The book is repetitious, abstract, & superficial,but it might be a place for some men to begin.If you would like to discover better books on this subject,search the Internet for the following bibliography:""Best Books on Gender-Personality"".James Leonard Park, creator of the Gender-Pattern Chart."
3,Fine as a burner bad for DVD playback,"I've owned this for about a year and with the last few months began using this for a lot of DVD playback. If the DVD's are anything more than slightly scratched the player can't handle it and skips, stutters, or just freezes. I've never had problems, however, when burning anything with it."
5,This training ROCKS! 13 DVDs plus a jam-packed resource CD.,Length:: 4:39 MinsIn this video I review and introduce this DVD training seminar for church planting.I am one of the three trainers featured in the product and the author ofThere's a Sheep in my Bathtub: Birth of a Mongolian Church Planting Movement
1,Read before ordering this CD,"For others who love slots and video poker as much as I do, please note that this product ONLY has 3 games on it - 2 slot machines and 1 video poker machine. I was wondering why it only took about 30 seconds to install! I have purchased casino software that has cost as little as [price] and it STILL had much more of a gaming selection on it. This software has more film clips pushing travel to Vegas than it does the actual games themselves. Do yourself a favor - order something else."
2,C'est Brigitte!,"At times I can't really comprehend Brigitte Bardot's fame- she's sexy, yes, and a fairly okay actress, but as a singer, she's just alright. Her music is not essential, but if you are into 1960's French music it's not all that bad. There are some great songs on this disc, not really worth buying the whole album, but still a fun listen."
3,Rehash,"If you know don't know anything about Norse or Celtic literature, then do not bother to read this book, because you have heard or can deduce nearly everything that this book contains.I picked it up when trying to write a paper about Tolkien and Norse literature, and it basically says everything other earlier critics (Jane Chance, Tom Shippey, Heather O'Donahue, to name but a few) have written before. I must say that Tolkien's ties to Celtic literature in particular are tenuous, if just because there aren't many surviving Celtic poems/stories. The Norse connections are obvious ones like Gandalf = Odinn, which any student of medieval literature knows (or should know).Again, if you do not know the difference between Grendel and Garm, then you will like this book. If you do, don't bother reading it."
5,A good one-hand tool.,"It is very easy to use with one hand to change the tighening or loosening setting on the fly adjusting the screw, while the other hand is holding the rest of the weight."
4,earrings,"since these were only $49.00, I can't complain...the picture is misleading. It should be indicated in the description that the photo magnifies these earrings immensely"
1,Tiny Diamond Don'ts,"Save your time, effort and money. The earrings came on time and were packaged nicely. However, there are major black spots in the diamonds themselves. It is almost as if someone dumped black pepper in the rocks. Even though the earrings are tiny, the blemishes interfere with the sparkle and therefore these lackluster diamonds appear even smaller ...and I would even go as far as to say that they look fake. It is too bad, it seemed like such a great deal."
4,great earrings at a low price,although a little small they are great earrings. would by them again in a heartbeat.
5,DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH,"Not much to say. They're the diamods that were pictured, my girlfriend iswearing them as of this writing.I'm hardly a diamond expert (except baseball diamonds where I used to make my living writing sports)but these looked pricey and not over-stated.I would buy them again but she has only two ears."
1,Terrible dont waste your time,"Go to a jewlery store and spend the extra money. Got these earings and returned them the next day. Cloudy, small, and overall bad quality"
2,Dark and cloudy,"Even from a few feet you can tell these earrings are cloudy with a darkish hue to them. I mean I guess they are decent for a starter set but if you want something impressive, these aren't it."
1,Pure Crap,"Thse earrings arrived very quickly but my joy turned to disbelief when I opened the box. The diamonds were milky white with ZERO sparkle or shine and the inclusion on one of the arrings was at the very top, surface level. Was impossible to miss. Keep looking; DO NOT buy these."
2,Got what I paid for,"The price was too good to be true. Although the size of the diamonds is accurate, they lack sparkle. My CZ's are prettier. Fortunately, these were for my 17 year old daughter. I didn't to spend a great deal in case she lost one. I wouldn't recommend buying any diamonds that fall this low on the color scale."
2,Not Great.,"After purchasing these for my girlfriend I realize I should have spent twice as much (I believe these were around $90 at my time of purchase). I knew they would be smaller, perhaps better suited for a second hole but I was disappointed by their quality. They aren't very bright or clear. I probably would have been better off buying quality fakes at the same price or less."
5,stunning studs,The clarity and workmanship is excellent. I am very pleased to get such quality for an even better price.
1,Poor Quality,"The price was the only thing that was good about these earrings.The earrings arrived very quickly and nicely packaged, but the quality of the diamonds were very poor. They looked dark and gray and not much sparkle. The white gold looked like pewter, not even silver gray. The picture on the website made them look clearer and shinier, which these were not!I will return them immediately."
4,simple and versatile,"I wore these earrings on my wedding day, and I wear them to work as well. They look great. Sure, the diamonds aren't perfect quality, but mine sparkle beautifully and I can't tell the difference. Terrific value for the money. Nice size, small but nicely visible. These were exactly what I was looking for."
3,"Not bad, but not great either...","The diamonds are smaller then expected but look pretty good. They are not as bright as expected either but they still are reasonable for their price. Overall they deserve 3 stars and could be better, but could be worse as well."
2,"Poorly matched, spotty quality","These earrings can be hit or miss. At this quality, flaws are expected, but one would expect the stones to at least match. However, at this size, you can't really tell how off they are unless you're closer up. I received one earring with a little spot in it and the other looked like it was about to bloom with mildew. I just needed something to keep the holes in my ears from closing up and they do the job admirably, but don't get these as a gift for someone special."
4,Look good Poor pakaging,Unlike one of the other reviews the earings I got were good. The price was good although if you buy these you might want to by an earing case if you are giving them away as a gift. Mine arrived in a box and in the box was a little bag. I could feel the earings but I could not see them. The bottom of the little blue bag had several holes in the lining and they had slipped through. Other than that I felt that they were as good as I expected for the buck.
3,As Expected,"While I *hoped* to receive a better pair of diamonds, I did receive what was promised ... K color, I3 clarity. When I place this pair next to my F color VS1's, this pair looks gray and dull. The cut is poor -- uneven and not symmetric.This pair is a gift for my 16-yo niece for Xmas. I'm sure she'll love them ... and won't know the difference between these diamonds and better quality ones."
1,Horrible.. DO NOT Waste your time,"Please don't make the mistake I did by ordering these earrings. I did not read the reviews of other people regarding these as I should have. They do not look at all like real diamonds. They do not sparkle. They honestly look like stones made out of plastic. Although, plastic might shine more than these.They are not worth the money at all!"
1,Poor color,I expected these earrings to be small but the color and clarity is much worse than I expected. The diamonds look milky white and have not sparkle. I would not spend a dime on this piece.
2,Not good for VGA presentations,"We bought this projector for training presentations. We are now in the processes of returning it. The 5 year old projector we have has a more legible text output. I'm not sure what the problem is, from other reviews this projector is great for movies. If you are looking for a VGA presentation projector this is NOT the solution."
1,Unreliable,"I purchased the MP610 to use for powerpoint presentations & Movies. While it does OK on powerpoint presentations it is usually unable to read movies. The worst part is fiddling around with it for hours then it works for a bit, set it up in front of a group and it lets you down!At first I thought I might have done something wrong, but not even my geek friends could get it to work for more than a few minutes. It's been used for less than 60 hours but I'm ready to replace it with another brand. I'll never buy Benq again."
1,Be warned,"Please be aware that this game will only run on the lowest screen resolution, with 265 colors and 640X800 resolution. If you have a new machine, it simply won't run. I paid for it but can't use it."
4,Great if you have the right OS,"This is much better than other versions of Mah Johgg that I've seen. It has fun tile sets from which to choose, each with its own music and cursor style. You can select your background picture from the many available if you want one. Making matches start mini-animations as the tiles disappear. You have four game types, too - or you can choose to play the Tournament, which includes all four. All of these ""extras"" are optional, though, so you can choose to use them during play or not.The only drawback to Shanghai is that it's not compatible with my new computer operating system. Make sure you check the system requirements before you buy the game."
3,Same Tunes,"This looks to be the forerunner for a later work named ""Metro Lounge."" Same song titles..."
1,Very BAD quality,"I placed an order to buy these stickers with RED Arabic letters for my white Apple wireless keyboard, but what I received was with WHITE letters so they didn't work. Fortunately, I have a MacBook Pro with black keyboard, so I decided to use them, BUT, each sticker can cover about 75% of each key. As a result, I threw them in the trash.The worst thing that happened after this purchase was when I received and email from Amazon Market Place asking me to rate this order and the seller, so I wrote exactly what I mentioned above, the next day I received an email from the seller who insisted that it was my mistake because I ordered stickers with white letters not red and that I needed them for my PC not for my mac! plus, the way that the seller has wrote their email to me was very rude and I saved their email. Well, I'm writing a review right now on the product that I purchased which indicates that it is with red letters not white."
5,Princeton Tec Tec 40 Flashlight,Had this product previously but lost it while hunting. It was perfect for carrying along on any outdoor adventure. Very durable and reliable. I had no doubt to replace the original with another one. Good value for the investment.
3,give me something new,"Yeah, I have to say that Brecker is one of the most amazing saxophonist out there. His solo's are always incredible and exciting. Yet this new album is not the best work of his up to date. The type of playing and concept is no different than his last two albums. In fact, I feel that this is his least innovative album yet. I love the way Brecker plays but I really want to hear something new from a man who is so talented."
2,Could have been better?,"this extragavant team of jazz all stars,falls short of their actuall capability to produce a better album,this album is dissapointing. Being without a bass instrument is another downfall,could have used charnett moffett or other modern greats."
3,"Great chops, but a shame about the content","I thought this was a really strange album from Brecker. After his last two albums, I was expecting some more, really forward looking charts and playing. Instead we get something which is seems to be appealing much more to the masses, with nothing radical in there. To be honest if this is the type of music you really like to listen to, then there are much better examples available from the 60s and 70s. But if you're more interested in the future of mainstream, go and get Tales From the Hudson, or Two Blocks From the Edge"
4,Special Gift,"There was a great variety of pictures of sisters spending time together. Well made with a dust jacket and hardback. Was a special, heartwarming gift to give my sister. Great coffee table book that will make you think of your sister whenever you see it."
3,Not as New as Advertised,"This book was advertised as Like New, but was not the gift quality book I expected."
2,Little!,"I loved this book, but lost it. I ordered this one, thinking it would be the same version, but instead got this Mini version... If you know where I can get the normal sized version, I would by 3."
5,Wonderful Book,"This is a wonderful book about all different kinds of sisters, all the things they go through, how they have dealt with it. Remembering happy times, sad times, and just plain fun times. Comparing each other, how they are different, and the same. Appreciating each other for it. I recommend this book for everyone who is a sister."
1,THIS IS NOT A FULL SIZE BOOK!,Bought this product thinking this was a full size book. It was not. This book is about 3inchesX3inches. If you are looking for a full size book look somewhere else on amazon.
5,I Got's FOUR now gimme more!,I love this whole dang series and now that I have copped Volume 4 I just need you all at Kung Faux to make me some more!
3,Estleman slips with Vermillion,"I have long been an Loren D. Estleman fan and own most of the books he has had published. I am sorry to say I was disappointed by The Adventures of Johnny Vermillion and think it is a weak addition to my Estleman collection. While the premise and storyline are good, its execution was deficient with poor character development, dialog that did not seem to always fit and a telegraphed ending."
1,2000u out of box failure with no customer support,"I have tried repeatedly to get the 2000u to work to no avail. More calls to Customer Support than I can afford. After asking for a manager I was told my problems were common, if I wanted them to check out the scanner (since phone support could not figure it out) I had to send back the scanner at my expense and they would determine whether or not to repair, refurbish or replace the scanner. The final gotcha was that I had tried for over three months to solve the problems by phone and was now out of warranty and they refused to even look at it if I did send it back. Buy ANYthing else."
2,"Well, it can sorta scan!",I was hoping to get a wonderful scanner to put pictures of my kids on our webpage. Pictures look blotchy and the OCR is horrible. I would suggest saving up for a higher end model.
2,An Abomination,"The Umax Astra 2000U has locked up completely on me after very limited service. I have attempted Power Cycling as recommended by the website, with no results. The VistaScan software, the scanner control strip module, and any attempt to access the TWAIN driver through Photoshop or Photodeluxe all crash my laptop. As other reviewers have testified, customer support is either nonexistent (via email) or unconscionably expensive (via telephone). Had God not convinced Pharaoh to free the Hebrews with the Passover plague, He surely would have bombarded Egypt with thousands of these useless scanners. Invest your money wisely: go HP."
3,Great value for +/- $$$,"Every item has a price point vs technical capability. To a certain extent, you get what you pay for. Yes a 2400 X 2400 48 bit scanner is better, but would be pricier. If you want a capable scanner for scrapping, internet use or using your scanner for fax purposes - this is a great scanner. If you are looking for more precise results, check into more current models with higher resolution and higher bit capability.I just purchased the Umax Astra 2000U and find it quite capable."
2,Creeping Red Death,"DO NOT buy this scanner for anything other than light, casual use! I am a graphics professional and will be kicking this scanner to the curb as soon as my new one arrives.For a few months now, every picture scanned looks like it has had Pepto-Bismol dumped on it. (This problem has existed since purchase, but has gotten steadily worse.) Picture contrast is muddy and awful. The color-correction sliders built into the scanning software do diddly-squat, and whatever filter it comes with that theoretically removes dot-screen from printed material is a joke.I spend so much time in Photoshop fixing what the scanner did to the originals that it's actually become more efficient to drive to a friend's house, scan the pictures, upload them, drive back to work, and download them.That's sad."
3,your own pet without the extra work,i think that dogz 2 is a fantastic game 4 all ages it has the reality of a real dog and the animation adds an extra touch to it. the only problem i found was that after a while you get bored and there is absoloutley no where to download more dogs. besides that it is great.
4,My daughter loves dressing her doll....,My daughter was very excited to get clothes and shoes for her doll. It is much less to buy these clothes and shoes on Amazon vs. American Girl. Glad I looked! Thanks!
3,Little mermaid ariel child costume 7-8,I love the costume until my daughter put it in and see through make sure they wear something underneath Ifurther than that I love it and look good on her.
3,"A nice story, but lacked what a women wants to read about!","This book had a great idea, but there was to much war talk and not enough love talk. I got lost in the details of the war and sometimes just couldn't wait for the chapter to end. I hoped the next chapter would kick in with some romance, but it fizzled. If you want details about what it would have been like to have been in World War II, and a prisoner of war, then this is a good book for you. If you are a women who wants a romantic tale, I would skip this one."
2,fizzles at best,"After enjoying the brilliant ( a word I don't frequently use) compilation David Alvarado mixed for Guidance Recordings over and over again, I snatched this one up so fast it made the wrapper melt. I eagerly shoved it into the cd changer in my car and got ready for a journey into freaky house world. The first track started off mellow and I thought ""cool"", then it very ungracefully bumbled into track number 2 and I thought ""okay-keep listening"". Then I snoozed through tracks 3 and 4 and woke up quite pleased with 5,6, and 7. Then all hell broke loose and it turned into pop dribble and I thought ""what the...?"" A pretty big dissapointment unless you happen to like listening to just flat lyrics with very little house or funk whatsoever. I'm going to record the first half of this one then try to recover some of my money at a used record store."
2,Dissapointing,"Hi, I am new to gaming and i have to say that this book is poor quality and was rushed. It has added nothing to my understanding of the game. It has no index to find anything. It misses so many bugs, Bradygames should get an update for it, it is so bad."
1,Poor Quality Tapes!!!,"Abbott & Costello's Who's on First is great, but this copy is a flop. I purchased it and anticipated watching the comedy team I remembered watching in the 70's on our black& white tv. This version is taken from a 1950's early tv show that is very grainy and the sound is inconsistant. This Who's On First is part of a tv variety show and it is not the polished version I remembered from the Sunday morning movie or from the radio show. This is not worth the $. It was very disappointing! Try to get your copy somewhere else. This one is boxed with an Errol Flyn movie that I didn't even bother opening. The quality of the picture and sound was that bad. My kids were really disappointed."
3,"madcatz 52825 game boy advance sp ""ultra"" link??",i bought this at best buy because my friend had a game that you could link with. on the game package it said that you only needed one game cartridge. so i took it home and invited her over.we did everything correctly but only the gba sp with the game in it just started the game as normal and said there was an open connection. i ended up buying the same game and 2 player mode wasnt so great anyway. the directiond are lousy (only a few pictures) and the overall idea and look of it was good but it just wasnt practical. i would reccomend buying a nintendo brand link instead.
4,HE'S HERE!,"LK has been purposely catching my attention over the years with his eye catching CD covers and grooves. I can't avoid him. I just have to take notice. Like not expecting Mr. K to pop up with his guitar on stage at The Artist's concert in Holland last December. ""There he goes again"", I thought to myself. With the current cuts on this particular CD, he gives me what I want right now, creativity. He really has alot of style."
3,Tuvok Rock,"Have never once thought about picking up one of those Leanord Nimoy or William Shatner albums, and am honestly nowhere near being the world's greatest Star Trek fan. I recently saw Tim Russ at a Star Trek convention in Vegas, and he came out on stage in a red vest with a guitar while Neil Norman's Orchestra was playing, and I thought to myself `Oh boy, here we go...' But let me tell you -Tim is one fine vocalist, and a pretty decent guitarist as well. He came out and absolutely blew me away with his rendition of `Crossroads' (available on this CD). I promptly bought this CD and one of his others, `KUSHINGAZA,' which I must say is superior to this one. Tim's music is honest and soulful, if the music is not always on par with his singing. He really should be experienced live for a full appreciation of his talent. This is a decent album, but you should check out Kushingaza, for a better introduction to his work (and songwriting). This is NOT what you'd expect."
4,Tim Russ,"Something old, something new, something mellow, something blues. Tim Russ has something for everyone. His original tunes, plus some classic favorites make this a wonderful addition to any CD collection. I highly recommend it."
1,oh no ... not again.,"Much as I love Star Trek, I really wish that the actors involved wouldn't fall prey to believing they can sing! Guess those who don't remember history are doomed to repeat it (Remember when Shatner & Nimoy tried to sing? At least ONE of them is trying to bury the memory!) Tim Russ sounds like a graduate of the Steve Urkle School of Music. And, where I wouldn't roll up my car window if he was singing along with the radio in the car next to me (unlike the aforementioned gentlemen) -- I certainly wound NOT invest in a CD from Mr. Russ.It just wouldn't be logical."
1,Lost in Space,"This album should have been lost with the Star Trek ship that Tim was on and never found...It is terrible. If you want some good music from a star trek actor, try James Darren from DS9"
1,Wow....incredible lyrics!,"Well, this is laughable! Lines such as ""now its time to seperate the girls and the boys"" are so brilliant that I had to award this album 1 star! Seriously, the originals are so bad, they will make you want to slit your wrists. Mine are heavily bandaged as we speak."
1,Oh dear...,"If you're going to sing about Louisiana, you need to at least pronounce the words correctly..."
4,Inspiring ideas.. nice projects!,You may have this book as a future referance for a completing decor to any of your bed-size quilt project. You may also have fun decorating your house or making a loving gift. Different projects for every taste!
3,Adequate reading for Lehigh Valley ghost & spirit buffs.,"This book did disappoint me. It covered a wide range of the Lehigh Valley from the Slate Belt to Alburtis. However, the book relied heavily on folklore and second-hand stories rather then eyewitness accounts. On the other hand, the authors did povide pictures and competent discriptions of the sites and the locations."
3,Looks are a little deceiving,I love using the two large casserole dishes but I don't have much use for the smaller ones which are much smaller than I expected them to be. The smaller ones are not only small but are very shallow: maybe 1 inch or so deep.
2,For serving? Yes. For actual cooking? No.,"I've wrecked each and every piece of this Corningware by one of two things. Either I stacked them in such a way that they bumped against each other, or I scrubbed them with ""scratch safe"" sponges, and in each instance I got the same result: permanent streaky black marks in the white ceramic finish. So please learn from my pricey mistake. Go straight to the Pyrex or Marinex instead."
1,The 2.5 oval was broken. Im getting really tired of this. There is no need to say any more. Broken.,I have to write 20 words on broken. The rack cant even be used with that dish broken. By the way one of the lids is too small.
1,Not the same color as advertized,"The color I received is not the same color as the one shown in the picture (the color I currently wear all the time, Pistol Packin' Pink)...It has the same name, but the color of the polish in the bottle I received is more orange than pink.All I can say is: What happened?The shipping was excellent, but the product's label was switched, perhaps?I won't order polish on line again."
2,"Too hard, too slow!","Although well reviewed in the press, I, too, found this virtually unusable. It is not very intuitive, and like the other reviewer I found it to be buggy and the cause of a multitude of GPFs. The furniture styles are limited, and it takes alot of time to build a floor plan for a house without square rooms. Then you try to furnish the room, and disaster strikes. I give up."
2,The only thing that was deluxe was the price...,"I was extremely disappointed in Total 3D Home Deluxe (v1.0). This is the first software that I have ever bought that was unusable as shipped.Entire rooms would disappear on walk-throughs, leaving only lonely door frames to mark their absense. The 3D rendering software generated almost photo-realistic images of rooms, but left ugly black visual artifacts on surfaces. If you wait 45 minutes for software to render an image of a bathroom, you shouldn't have to spend another 20 minutes in Photoshop trying to repair it!Don't buy this -- wait for version 2.0."
2,Low Quality,This is very low quality. It lasted a couple of months before the clear vinyl interior portions began to tear awaay from the faux leather external portion of the case.
4,for fans of fellini,"i'm a lover of nino rota's music scores for fellini's films, so, of course, i had to love this cd even before i bought it, providing pieranunzi's interpretations did not stray far from rota's melodies, and they don't. i suppose i should say something about the line-up: chris potter on sax, charlie haden on bass, paul motian on drums, and kenny wheeler on drums. and i admit, for me, hearing chris potter is often a treat, but as far as i'm concerned, just about anyone can record rota's music and if they stay close to the melody as written by rota, i'm happy.when first watching fellini and hearing that marvelous dreamy music i knew i wanted to find a jazz recording of the music that added so much poignancy to the films. i'm very pleased enrico pieranunzi recorded these songs."
3,Could have been better!,"I am a big fan of Fellini/Rota. This recording could have been great were it not for Paul Motian's one dimensional drumming ----- what's with the ride cymbal? Obviously he does not connect with this music. This recording needed a ""set"" player; i.e., Peter Erskine, Jack Dejohnette,Joey Baron,Bill Stewart, Billy Kilson,Brian Blade,etc."
4,Leviton Switch,"I have not used this product as of yet, because we went and bought a switch at the hardware store. Could not go without the light.They look very good though, and I like the packaging of them all together. If you need a switch or just to have some in stock this is a good deal."
1,Broke Right Away,This product was shipped in a plastic bag with a small piece of paper for padding which was not enough to protect it on the way here. The screw to hold the battery cover on was missing and the batteries were loose in the bag as well. The wand had to be shaken to make it work though it would only go for a few seconds. I let my little one hold it for a few minutes and when I took it back the spinning part in the middle of the globe had come loose so none of it works now. The recipient of this wand is thankfully too young to really care but I'm disappointed with this product. I would not recommend purchasing it.
1,Stopped Working Immediately,"My girls loved it but I had to throw it away after the first week. It would only work after I jiggled it around for a while, and this was with brand new batteries in it. I even tried another set of batteries and it was still defective."
5,Pure magical delight,Adults can have fun with it too! Try bringing it to your favorite watering hole. I did and it was snatched out of my hands immediately!
3,"Fun, but not very deep, which I think is fine for this fluff","This is a book of very quick hit psych tests, or facsimiles of psych tests, that are supposed to give you a well rounded idea of who you are. At the end of reading it, I didn't really feel I knew anything more than I did beforehand. But the types of tests they go over are both varied and fun, so I think the book was overall fine. Just don't go into it thinking it will reveal all the deep secrets of your soul. It's purely fluff. By it for fun."
2,"Good content, but not complete","I spent a whole day figuring out the 4 different aspects of my personality, but it didn't give me any practical ways in the end to apply the findings (pick the right career field, etc.). For that reason, I was very disappointed & it feels like I wasted all of that time without much to show for it..."
2,Slightly Inaccurate,It's fun to go through this book as other reviewers have stated. But I really don't think the defining aspects of personality types reflected in this book are that accurate. It's not so cut and dry as the book portrays.
3,Burn a copy.,"Well De La Soul is one of the first hip hop groups I ever listend to. So I have alot of respect for them. They came out when most where raping about compton, south central, and how many gats they had, but De La just did there own thing. This album though was disapointing, it isn't even De La look at how many people they have featured. It seems as though they are changing to sell records. Just the cover doesn't seem like De La to me.So my advise is to listen to it first before you buy it, I wish I had."
3,WHAT HAPPENED?!?!,"De La Soul is definitely one of my favorite hip hop groups. But I think this album was definitely a flop. It doesn't show their true personal flavor. Where is that sophistication that they carry? It seems like this is just an attempt for mainstream success. I recomment people get Stakes is High or Bulhoone Mind State, anything earlier before this. This isn't their true self in my opinion"
3,De La Soul is Dieing,"Pretty good comeback to hip-hop, but lacks the upbeat quality that De La soul used to have. Worth buying if you were a big fan, otherwise I'd stay away."
2,Lukewarm De La,"Put very simply, this album is a lot of fluff and not enough true De La. They included a whole mess of guests and so none of the tracks really sound like all De La Soul, but rather a joint project. I just miss the days of song after song of De La with a guest here and there, but not enough to take away from their style. This album also lacks a solid core like 3 feet and De La Soul is Dead had.. instead it ends up like a bunch of individual projects with other MCs... sorry, there just aren't enough of the Plugs here."
2,Room for improvement,"I have always looked to De La for an escape from the average shoot 'em up rap garbage that is littering the airways. Unfortunately, Artoffical.... didn't provide much of an escape. De La has always been a sure thing. This time, they missed the boat."
2,Oooh! - No!! Ouch!!,"I never know what to expect from De La, and I definetly wasn't expecting this. After waiting 4 years, they could have definitely done a better job. After hearing the first single, ""Oooh"" I was expecting great things from Art Official. However, that is the best cut on the album. None of the guest rappers seem to fit in. Originality was why De La was great. This album seems to just go by a formula similar to all other rap albums. They were once pioneers, now they seem to be just followers. As the first part of their so-called trilogy album, I hope they change things up on part 2."
1,De La Soul is more De La Sold,"Like all true hip hoppers, I've been listeneing to De La Soul since I was a youngin'. This album is the most commercialized failed attempt at being hip hop. This album is plain wack. I've listened to this album more than a dozen times, and I hate more everytime. Everybody is going commercial, and it makes me sick to my stomach. The only thing I can go over in De La's favor, is they have paid their dues in hip hop, and if the want to get extra chedda then thats their business. The down side is as more mc/groups justify selling out for more money, we have no more hip hop."
1,Art Official Intelligence...A Bomb!,"I've always found De La Soul to be very annoying, with their non-sensical lyrics. This CD is no different than any of their previous efforts. With the exception of ""All Good"", which features an outstanding performance from Pop legend Chaka Khan, the rest of the CD is very annoying. Just goes to prove that talent is no longer a requirement in the music industry. What a joke!"
4,De La Soul rocks on,"Maybe I'm biase,d but I like rappers who actually say something in their rhymes instead of just saying how good they are. De La Soul's days of commerical success are behind them, and this album is no different than the underratted intelligence of their last couple releases. There are no ""Me, Myself and I"" type hits here. However, it is a good piece of work if you look at it as a complete album."
4,Where to begin?,"I'm kinda sick of readin all these reviews sayin how it's not as good as their old stuff or there are too many guests. If you like their old stuff you gotta be 30 years old. Thats not really a dis but it's true. If you like hip-hop from '89 your old. period. The beats from then are different from the mid to late 90's and i think you would have had to grow up then to like stuff from then. ""Newer"" hip-hop started around the time of The Chronic. Thats when the beats started changing to what the kids listen to today. As for the record. Good. Not great, not bad, but good. Like many said there are a handful of standout tracks but the others are still listenable. It's not like theres only 3 cuts and then i take the cd out. I can listen to almost the whole thing. Theres also only like 2 or 3 ""skits"" out of 17 tracks which is good (I can't stand albums where like half the material are skits). Overall it's got fresh beats and is a good listen and worth having in your collection."
4,Dont Cut it so much,"11 years after their first CD De La is still puttin out rhymes that will make your mind twist. De La shows how diverse the group really is. Every CD De La changes their sound and elevates their beats to fit with the age. They've done it once again, a totaly new sound to get on down to. You wont find 2 songs that sound alike on this CD, using the beats that suit their featured guests De La throws their lyrical influence and Maseo's unique style of cuts on every track. It's true that once and a while you'll probably reach for the skip button, but really is a CD that has at least 8 dope tracks not worth getting? Track 9 ""All Good"" alone makes this CD All Good. If you are a De La Soul fan then you'll definetly respect what they do on this album."
2,Disappointing,"The only reason I see why any true De La or Native Tongues fan would give this album a good rating is nostalgia. De La was incredible, but this album simply is not. It does not flow, and the beats are only beats. It is not the music that people who don't even like hip hop can fall in love with. I can only compare this album with Q-Tip's solo release last year. They are both incredibly disappointing and leave me wishing that they had not released them so that the wonderful careers of some of my favorite artists would not be tainted. Buy '3 Feet High and Rising' and 'Midnight Marauders' for the greatest hip hop ever made."
3,Just below De La par,"After the excitement of the new De La album war off, i previewed the disc. My original go-through left me wanting more. The disc did get better the more I listened to it. But to me, a die hard De La fan, this work is definetely below par.Probably their worst effort of the 5. ""Oooh"" is a definite phat track, Redman lends a helping hand and the beat is dope. ""Squat"" is another phat track featuring Mike D and Ad-Rock of the Beastie Boys. But the rest of the disc is average at best. For all hip hop lovers, check out Common's new one, ""Like Water for Chocolate."""
4,A True Awakening,"Having only recently gotten into music (the past two years at college), I get the opportunity to rediscover people that I've been hearing about for years but never listened to. I got this CD today and I have to say that it is a memorable experience. Normal CDs of this calibre I would give 5 stars to, but De La gets four... because I'm almost positive that some of their older works have the potential to blow this out of the water. One thing I kind of got tired of on the album were all the guest appearances, and I have the hunch that they could rise above all their guest stars - and have in the past.All in all, it's a fabulous CD and I do not regret the purchase. I'll probably be bumping this thing for quite some time."
5,They only get better!,"I challenge anyone to find a hip hop group more dedicated, practiced, and proven than De La Sol. For years now they have stunned the rap world with their genuine good-feel hip hop message. You can't help but to bob your head at their past albums and Art Official Intelligence is no exception. De La makes it clear that they will hold true to what hip hop is and what it was meant to be. Rather than punk out like today's fake rap artists and put out bad records in the name of money, it is obvious that De La is dedicated to putting out only their best stuff for their fans to listen to. They respect your hard earned money and are committed to giving you your dollar's worth from start to finish. GO BUY IT!"
3,great fun,"this is a good album, no doubt. this album may not quite so intellectual as others have been, but they've not lost their sense of humor, and they are still representing the old school quite admirably. while the album isnt consistantly stellar, its much better than so much of the tripe that gets pumped out these days. by the way, ""the lady"" on All Good? that one of the previous reviewers had such a dislike for was Chaka Khan, and i think shes adding her own wonderful voice to an already wonderful track, i guess that could just be me, but damn..."
3,A lot of potential.,"De La Soul is a pretty cool group and at times their rap is pretty tight. I'm starting to get a little tired of Redman & Busta being on everybody's albums but Redman's song is pretty cool. I didn't like the one with Busta that much. Busta has lost his intensity which was one of the reasons I enjoyed his rap. The song with Redman is one of those songs that gets stuck in your head for about a week. Probably doing pretty well as a single in the States. But why the Beastie Boys? I'm all for white rappers, but not these guys. The song with Xzibit and the Lics is pretty good. It's a different type of rap CD and in the end it has an equal amount of good and bad on it."
3,Art Official Sound & Feel,"I have to admit i was very, very excited to pick up the new de la soul cd BUT it hasn't lived up to the wait. while the cd is good musically and there are some excellent ""guests"" on the album . . . art official intellegence is a HUGE departure from the sounds of de la soul that i am used to and the overall feel of the album is not what i expected. the cd is not terrible by any means though. true, an artist doesn't HAVE to sound the same time and time again and TRUE de la soul does not abandon their beats or rhymes BUT as for me, myself and i - - - i'll give it an ""eh"" and move on."
3,Pretty Good,De La Soul Breaks no New Ground.it's pretty much like the past couple of Releases.The Beats are still cool.having Chaka Khan is Cool.but overall Compared to what De La Could Have&Should Have Been as A Group Of Native Tongues nothing Really Challenging.Cleaver Grooves Here&there.but this isn't De La at their Best.
4,Abide With Me,I enjoyed Abide With Me. It has a beautiful pace and took me back in time. I would read other books by Elizabeth Strout.
4,Abide with Me,Excellent. She demonstrates in this earlier novel the gifts that will mature in her latest book.
2,Just OK,"I didn't even like this book until more than halfway through it. And then, I only went ahead and finished it because I was curious where the characters would end up in their situations.This novel was not satisfying; I did not finish the last page with a ""wow,"" or ""that was a great book"" and have no drive to continue reading about the characters. I really did not end up getting attached to any of the characters; I don't feel they were fleshed out enough.Meh."
3,A Hasty Finish,"I read Abide with Me after reading Strout's Olive Kitteridge and I think I was expecting the same fictional approach. Olive Kitteridge is a collection of connected short stories and I think that format would have made Abide With Me a better book. Both books detail existence in a small New England town and the connected, deeply personal lives of the townspeople. The many characters in Abide with Me are wonderfully rendered but their stories run out of steam at the end. It's not that it isn't wonderful they all drifted into the story, but they didn't advance the plot. The entire denouement feels forced and too many plot lines are resolved in a quick fix.I did enjoy this book. It reminded me of Haven Kimmel's The Solace of Leaving Early, another story about Christian existentialism in a small American town."
2,Small town life documented --- but drearily,"Strout captures the essence of small-town New England in Abide with Me, but that is about all. This book was darker than ""Amy and Isabelle"" and ""Olive Kitteridge"" and does not hold up well in comparison, in my opinion. Just too sad and melancholy and fairly boring, to be honest. And too many characters that I just did not care about."
2,Perplexed by the glowing reviews,"I liked Amy & Isabelle so I looked forward to reading this latest work. I will give anyone credit for being able to write- it takes a lot of disclipine to sit down and craft a story (hence the two stars). However, this particular story really bored me. I found the overall tone to be pretty dark and depressing. Perhaps b/c I just came off reading a pretty inspiring book (Eat Pray Love), this book seemed really sad and slow to me.I'm really not getting all the strong reviews here. Its an easy book to read, but I ended up not caring about any of the characters, not liking the town, and overall tired of the book. I was glad when it was over."
3,Slow reading...,"While I ended up enjoying the story I found it to be very slow reading. If I had not heard such rave reviews I doubt I would have finished it. I did like the story line but it was work to read it. I will try her first book, as it too has such good reviews, and hope for the best. I was disappointed I am sad to say."
5,SMALL TOWN / LARGE TOWN BOTH CAN BE VICIOUS,"It was wonderful to find this lovely book about a New England minister so mesmerizing. I hated to put it down. No violence, little action, but plenty of sharp roiling passion in what is a quiet community. The writing is so skilled and beautiful.I enjoyed this more than Strout's first novel:Amy and Isabelle: A novel. Reverend Tyler Caskey's struggles with grief remind us that it is not always just the steps so neatly outlined by grief counselors. We go through so much more.With each book, Strout gives us greater insights and understanding of complex human salvation."
2,Disappointing after Amy and Isabelle,"A letdown after her first novel, which to me was a real page turner. This book is VERY slow starting; I was half-way through and I really didn't know where it was going! Very unsympathetic characters in the townspeople with Tyler's character not very clearly drawn, apart from his reglious beliefs, which he didn't seem to have a strong hold on. I would have liked to know more about Lauren and her early life. Not much better than an OK read, I'm afraid - won't keep you up nights."
3,Easy Read,I came away from a long read of 'The Terror' looking for something light and ran across 'Abide with Me' in the book store. I admit it was the cover that caught my eye of the sad little girl. This book was exactly what I expected. It was an easy read set in a somewhat depressing time about a minister and his daughter and what happens after his wife dies. I was a little let down that the issues with the daughter were not more played out and came to a tidy end after one converstation between them. The author seemed to hint at some sexual abuse between the wife's father and her sister and perhaps even her friends but that too was never made clear so we were left to wonder if this was what played into the wife's kleptomaniac/shallow/self centered personality. Still a very good read that I looked forward to picking up everyday and reading.
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"This book was among several on the ""Free-Help Yourself"" table at the library. The blurbs on the back cover made it sound interesting and I wondered if it had been placed on the table by mistake. Au contraire. The writing was uneven and, in places ugly. It reads as if Ms. Strout had resurrected some old papers from a religious history course and tried to incorporate them into a story sequence while visiting a locker room. She seemed to be striving for ""holy"" with many references to Bonhoeffer and cheap vs. costly grace, but her plot was weak with threads that went nowhere and the result was more ""holey"" than holy. Characters were wooden, not fleshed out and inserted awkwardly. Search elsewhere for grace."
4,Great story...and the author presented it well.,It was chosen for a book club and I'm glad it was. Our group had a great discussion about the characters as well as the story the author told.
1,No redeeming features,"This is a very bad book. It is poorly written, the characters are caricatures in misery, and it is almost impossible to develop any empathy for them except for the older daughter, who suffers in silence after the devastating, and, to her, mysterious, death of her mother. Her father fails in both his calling to ministry and his responsiblities to protect his daughter. He is so distant that he believes what teachers tells him about his child's behavior, which is a perfectly legitimate childhood grief response, rather than the bad behavior that others choose to label her with indifference to her deep pain and confusion. He fails in his responsibilities to his parishoners by not realizing that he himself is mired in grief and needs a break. I couldn't finish this. It is drivel."
1,The worst book I have read in 5 years,"After reading the accolades about Amy and Isabelle, I was truly looking forward to reading Abide with Me. But I can honestly say that it is the worst book that I have read in years. Here I was hoping that perhaps it was a Jodi Picoult or a Sue Miller....but it ended up being a hard-covered Harlequin Romance. The story was shoddy...it was written for someone in a nursing home. The best page was the last page. Thank god....I am done the book. Definitely do not recommend...except for someone born in 1920."
2,Very interesting character study...but...,It goes nowhere...and I mean nowhere. It just ends leaving all sorts of loose ends lying everywhere. Preachy sometimes too much even thought the main character is a minister. Ending horrible!...but getting there wasn't too bad. Pick up a different book...life is too short to read this one.
2,Left Me Cold,"It's so fascinating to read reviews by ordinary readers like all of us, not literary reviews. Human nature is so diverse. The latest edition of The New Yorker gave a very favorable review of this book. But for me, I don't know that this was the worst book I've read in the last few months, but it came close. I couldn't have been less interested in the characters, the subject matter, the location - the whole book left me cold. I have read comparisons to Gilead - a wonderful book. Abide with Me is not in the same league, not even playing the same game."
2,So Disappointed!,"What could have been a wonderful read, and a well-written story, was interspersed with detailed, pornographic accounts of one man's sexual infidelity. Stout is a good enough writer to have gotten her point across without the obscenities.I would love to be able to recommend the book to others, as the story was otherwise nicely done, but those sections have made me choose to not recommend it.What a disappointment. C'mon, Elizabeth, take the high road next time."
1,A Pulitzer Prize author's second book,"Interesting characters, authentic settings, a plot based on characters' ' reactions to each other and their circumstances, and a hope for some sort of redemption at the end. What more could a reader ask? I truly enjoyed this and Elizabeth Strout's other two books."
1,Moving toward euthanasia,"Rather than accompanying another in their suffering which ends indeath, the author seems to convey that the compassionate way isto either to end another's life or give her the means to do it.Because of this view, I threw the book in the trash rather than passit on.I did think the author did a good job in portraying the foibles ofpeople in jumping to conclusions and, as a result, not being ableto be there for someone in the throes of grief and, at times, beingdownright harmful."
3,I wanted to love it,"I wanted to love this. The 1st book I'd ever read by Elizabeth Strout was Olive Kitteridge and I LOVED, LOVED it, so I had high expectations. Really high expectations, in fact. Maybe this was unrealistic, might even have been unfair, but how could I not? I found the prose itself elegant and flawless. The characters, though, were less engaging for me. Same with the storyline. It was slow going and I had to invoke my daughter's you-must-give-a-book-50-pages rule and then again. At about the halfway mark, I felt like I was finally engaged. More of a struggle than I wanted it to be."
4,Abide with me review,"I am a big fan of Elizabeth Strout and have read her other books. Her characters make lasting impressions as do her descriptions of the surroundings in which she places them. I was not really into some of the religious philosophy discussions, but I benefitted from the book nonetheless."
3,Really depressing,"Throughout 90% of this story, it is really depressing. At the ending it brightens, but the balance of how a book makes a reader feel could have been better. Not Elizabeth Strout's usual great writing."
4,Joy to an 8 year old boy!,"For a kid heavily into marbles these are just about perfect. How little it takes to see someone happy. Plenty of different sizes it even made other kids in the group ask me if I could get them the same thing. Too many to count I played it diplomatically and did not agree or disagree for I do love all kids to feel equal, but my wallet was not ready for a mass purchase. Cody loved these marbles and for the price I thought it was a great purchase, specially for those who find in marbles so much fun. 4.5 Stars!"
1,Mega Marbles New Generation Marble Set,Not a good choice for our little grandchild as the marbles are too big to use in Quercetti Marble Run with Motorized Elevator. Sad part is it broke that other game on Christmas Day!
5,Great set.,"We use these for our marble run, so it's Jo that some are bumpy. They are beautiful! It is really a nice variety pack!"
3,Where's the theme song?,"I guess the video company that purchased the rights to these episodes decided it would be less expensive to compose their own theme music instead of paying the copyright holder to use the familiar ""whistling"" tune on the tape. Whatever the reason, it doesn't work.The episodes are the same great shows we all remember, but the music isn't the same and the visual quality of the tape itself is a little bit shaky. Be aware of this if you're considering a purchase of this cassette."
1,Great Depression or War on Business?,"First of all, why would you want to listen to a statist like Mario Cuomo talk about another statist FDR and his failed policies that only prolonged the depression. There needs to be a fresh documentary from someone that wouldn't have just worshiped FDR like so many people did. This excuse for a man hurt our country in so many ways.Roosevelt either wanted to start a Stalinist revolution or he just didn't have a clue. Actually there is a copy of a letter where FDR wrote to his treasury secretary for help in filling out his taxes, this guy gets way to much credit for being even close to smart.The one fact to remember about the Depression is that it ended only after Roosevelt's War on Business and Prosperity ended."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I ordered this after reading the other three reviews. I was expecting to like it more. I didn't. It has a lot of what I'd call fluff - for example, they could have covered more relevant things than marathon dancing, and the advent of TV.I don't think I would buy it again."
2,the democratic view of the great depression,"I really thought this CD was biased in favor of FDR and his policies.Maybe I should have expected that point of view since it was narrated by Mario Cuomo, but I was hoping for a neutral perspective. I also agree with another commentator, why did they spend so much tape covering marathon dancing?!A bette CD for your money would be The emergence of Modern america in both the roaring twenties and the great depression series.terry Jennrich"
1,Pedestrian,"I was completely disappointed in this pedestrian rehashing of the story of the Depression...why must we see the same footage of breadlines and wall street panic that has been used countless times in documentaries since the 1950's...There MUST be fresh images and film that we haven't seen to death..how's about a little research!!!...anyway, it IS the story of that period in history but there is nothing fresh here!"
3,Mr. Piotrowski offers thought-provoking analysis!,"It is surprising to see Mr. Piotrowski give us such a broad and mostly fair analysis of the issues in Poland during the 1918-1947 period. Having read his ""Genocide and Rescue in Wolyn"", in which he presents such a biased and distorted Polish view of Ukrainians and their struggle for independence, (which he terms as ""genocide"", but which in reality was a struggle against Polish colonialism in Ukraine), I had to check and see if perhaps there were two Mr. Piotrowskis. In this book, Mr. Piotrowski examines the role played by the various ethnic groups, and in particular, focuses on the role played by the Jews, both in their complicity with the Nazis and, most of all, with the Soviets and the International Communist movement. This book helps to debunk the myth of Jewish exclusivity of the Holocaust."
4,Health O Meter Scale,"Upon the advice of my physical therapist, I ordered this scale. The first opportunity I had to compare its accuracy to my doctor's scale, I did and found it to be very accurate....within 1-2 pounds. The numbers between each of the increments are a bit difficult to read, although if you have ""young"" eyes you may not have a problem!"
2,Where's the dial indicator?,"looked like a nice enough scale, but it had no indicator. After a few quick shakes i heard it rattling around around inside the scale. Thank God for Amazon's easy return policy."
4,Reliable and accurate,"This scale is accurate and the readings are consistent, unlike an overpriced Weight Watchers digital scale that I bought awhile back (the reading would swing around 7 pounds when I stepped on the scale consecutive times, seconds after each other). I realized that I would rather have a reliable scale than one that comes with all the bells and whistles (water weight, body fat percentage, bone mass, la-dee-da). The delivery came at the end of the shipping date range, but that's fine with me. My only complaint is that the scale is a little bulky, but that's worth it to have a consistent and reliable scale."
1,Junk,"I foolishly ordered this scale even after reading negative reviews about the needle not being attached upon opening. Sure enough when I received the scale and opened the packaging, there was no needle on the dial. A slight shake confirmed that the needle dislodged and was loose inside the scale. As I am stationed in South Korea, returning the item would have been more of a hassle than just junking it. I opened it up (thus voiding the warranty) and retrieved the needle. After some painstaking problem solving to figure out how to reattach the springs that hold the two pieces of the scale together, I was back in business, or so I thought. The scale needs to be massively adjusted every time someone gets on and off of it. I just placed a water bottle with exactly 24 ounces of water in it, 1 1/2 pounds, on the scale and the needle didn't even attempt to move. This thing is worthless. Save your money. I now have a $40 door stop."
4,Consistent!,"I replaced a still-working electronic scale because it varied as much as two pounds from one day to the next, and the variations made no sense. After a few initial weighings and easy adjustments, this HealthOMeter scale is much more consistent. I've had it and used it daily for over two weeks now, and it returns exactly to zero every time.I agree with some other reviewers that the per-pound lines are a little difficult to read, but even in dim light without my glasses, it's not hard to judge where the indicator lies between the five-pound lines and get my weight to the nearest pound. If you need more than one-pound precision, you will have to go for a digital scale.I would definitely buy this scale again, especially at the price it's going for now."
3,Still had to squint :(,"Even though the numbers are big enough, the lines in between are just as hard to see as any regular size (and cheaper)scale."
3,Some considerations,I use this scale in my office which is carpeted. Unfortunatlely it possible to get different weights depending on the balance point chosen by the person weighing himself. Lean foward more weight. Lean back less weight. Also the needle does not return to zero. It must be adjusted.
3,Excellent Brake Pads...But not for a Subaru WRX,"I have a 2004 subaru wrx and these Brake Pads are not for my car. I have put around 3,000 miles on them now and they have given my rotors Hot Spots. I have spoken with guys at EBC and they have confirmed that I purchased the wrong pads for my car and that is what caused the hot spots and have taken care of me by giving a a set of Yellow Stuff pads to replace the Red Stuff pads. 100% A+ Customer service for EBC. AFter explaining to them that their website tells you that the Red Stuff is great for my car at a race event ... they told me I purchased the wrong pads. So If you have a subaru wrx don't buy the red stuff buy the yellow stuff. The Yellow Stuff is for ""Heavier Vehicles""(according to what EBC says) I have had them on my car now for about 500 miles and these things are way better. Hopefully it stays that way."
1,Full of grammatical errors,"So full of grammatical errors that I even question the substance of the book. And, no, I'm not an English teacher."
1,So sad...,"I think it is so sad that Brad Knight is profitting from this TERRIBLE piece of literature. He goes off in tangents about his own life, his own restructuring of his house and is constantly adding his own biased opinion at every turn! His facts are incorrect and I feel sorry for family members of not only Laci Peterson but also for Amber Frey and her relatives. Brad Knight should never have been allowed to print this book of bias and his editor should have known better to help in this projects. There are many miss-spellings and grammatical errors throughout the book. The editor needed an editor- or spell check at least! It is not worth the cost! Read Witness by amber frey instead- it is much better!!!"
1,Awful,"Do not waste your money on this one. Aside from the fact that this book is filled with grammatical and spelling errors, it has little to do with the actual facts regarding the Laci Peterson case. Mr. Knight spends more time giving the reader different scenarios of what could have happened, or what could have been said rather than presenting the facts in a legitimate light. I couldn't care less about when and where he bought his home, what he would have said or done if he were Scott Peterson, or how he would have handled the defense differently. Besides, the fact that he was not only picking up women during his volunteer work in the search for Laci, but that he was dim enough to share this less than admirable fact with the reader speaks volumes. Do yourself a favor, buy the Catherine Crier book on this case instead, it will prove to be money much more well spent."
2,Just ok,The beginning of the book was ok and there were maybe one thing in this book different from anything else i read but the whole book was more about the OJ trial and other trials then the peterson story. he talked to much about how he felt then what really happened.Sorry but I like the Amber Fry book better it gave you more information on why scott would kill his family.
2,Who cares about Knight's opinion?,"There was some interesting info in this book about the murder case, but way too much info about what Knight thinks! Who cares what he would have done? His claim to fame is living a short distance from the Peterson's (Scott & Laci). If you are curious and facsinated with this story you'll probably enjoy it for the most part, I literally stopped where Knight gave ""his"" opening and closing arguments,I just found his ""what I'd have dones"" annoying."
1,"Awful writing, uneducated author, so many mistakes...","How odd that someone who knows so little about the Peterson case would choose to write a book (Books!) about it.First, there is nothing in here (aside from the frequent errors of fact, that is) that you can't find in, for instance, popular media articles or even the Wikipedia page. This man Brad wasn't an ""insider"" by any stretch except perhaps zipcode.The writing is atrocious; the author should be ashamed at his poor grammar and writing skills, but also in his poor grasp of the case and lack of a good editor. It was also poorly researched, contained a lot of odd asides that allowed for easy interpretation of the author's various emotional issues, and wasn't especially interesting.Glad to see the majority of the reviewers were honest about the content so folks interested in this case could get steered toward more accurate and interesting books."
5,"Without hesitation, it is the best.","I guess you could say I'm a bit of a Laci-buff. After reading all the books on the Laci Peterson case (including Amber's book), if you only have time to read one book about the Laci Peterson case, without hesitation, Brad Knight's Laci Peterson: The Whole Story is the one I'd recommend.In following the investigation I had remembered hearing bits of information on certain witnesses and evidence to be presented, but then never heard anymore on these issues. The author took some of these overlooked factors, did research, and came out with startling revelations that otherwise simply would have gone unnoticed. Brad Knight must have put a tremendous amount of heart into this rendition, because he brings new life to this on-going and highly popular murder case.The only other thing I can say about this book is: I can't wait for this author to release another book. I'll be waiting.Ken StevensArizona"
4,Good Book - Inside Case Info,"I found it hard to put this one down. Almost every paragraph I found intriguing. For anyone who has been following the Laci Peterson case, I'd definitely recommend this one. Like some of the other newly written books on the case, it contains tidbits of new and different information I haven't seen anywhere else. At times I even found myself close to tears, either in sadness or humor during certain intense moments of the story."
4,Bestseller in England,"I read Brad Knight's book on the Laci Peterson case, which was quite well-written. Someone complained that the author gave his opinion in the book. Well, what do they expect him to do?...Not give his opinion! He's an author for God's sake, of course, he's going to give his opinion!This book is a bestseller in Great Britain. This guy is a surfer from California and he got rich off writing this book! Scoff at this one all you want, but this author made it in! Congratulations, Brad! Keep up the good work jolley 'ole fellow. I look forward to ya next rendition.Stewart James, Manchester"
4,"Long, but good.","What I liked about the Brad Knight book was that it was almost 500 pages, whereas all the other books are only barely 200 pages each. Just more bang for your buck here. Better quality writing and information too."
2,"Book was OK, software was not","This book was useful, but the software was a disappointment. the sofware was not very similar to the actual GRE test."
4,Pentax 330GS,"The camera is great to use and has a lot of neat features quick capture, flip out display, one step review, small size avi viedeo. It would be better if it could record sound with the video.I would have given it a 5 star rating except for dissappointng performance using 2 AA batteries. The CR V3 lithium battery is not rechargable and very expensive, however does last a long time. The instruction book says that you can use normal alkaline AA and get about 50 shots (acceptable) but I found that I could only get 2 or 3 (unacceptable) before I started to get ""battery depleted"" warning. Forget trying to use normal AA batteries.Note that the 330 RS comes with rechargeable Lithion Ion batteries, in hind sight it would have been worth the extra bucks.I brought the camera in Hong Kong"
4,hot!!!,"this is a young group from memphis. they did a concert in my city their lyrics are deep and, these rappers have come a long way . this is a nice album !!!"
1,DVD manufacturering quality is SUB PAR DO NOT BUY,bought all 4 seasons and while I love to watch the A-team I have to say stay away from the dvd set as the manufacturering quality of these disks is the WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN. Season 1 was the only season that played without incident. Season 2 disks refused to play side 2 of any disks and season 3 the last disk would only play the first 2 of the 8 episodes on the disk. Seanon 4 opening disk caused the player to stop when you selected play all....wish I would have gotten it through amazon......
1,Amazon Customer Service Sucks!,"Amazon has just lost two customers. My room mate and I have shopped Amazon for years and almost exclusively shop Amazon for Christmas. We also found problems with Season 3, ""Bend In the River"", as well as problems with Season 4. Amazon's Indian help desk has offered no support in replacing these bad discs because they were purchased in October. They only offer 30 day replacement, so better not shop for Christmas before December folks. We had to go through every disc in all of our dvd's (and we bought a lot) and check them for damage. We found a lot of stains, finger prints and scratches on what were supposedly new dvd's. We will be taking our business elsewhere in the future."
4,Defective disk?,"Disk 3, Side B""The Little Town with an Accent"" ....... the disk fails to play at speed after Murdock is discovered undercover as Carlos Mendoza with a Z. Sameproblem on another player too."
3,Nice season Dvds have problems,"Again Universal Studios has done it.Some episodes hasn't got preview some has sound effects missing and the menu episode summary has been ripped off as well the episode chapters.The season starts with a 2 hour premiere called Judgment Day.The rest of episodes are fun to watch and include some guest stars such Boy George,Hulk Hogan and others.The episode formula is always the same:the bad guys threatens the nice and innocent people,the A-Team is called and hired,then they move on the goons and finally their boss is beaten after the team is locked up in some warehouse with plently of tools and acetilene torch to make a Mcgyver style a weapon or defense.Of course noone is hurt and all the bullets never hit anyone.The show success is based on the chemistry between the characters and how they interact.Until fall the Fith and last season won't be released and I hope that a nice docummentary on the phenonmenon can be included."
4,Untainted Talent,"Frank Fradella is certianly a writer who has not been tainted by the usual pitfalls of trying to become an established author. In this book, Dead Things, he writes from his soul and his own personal outlook. The title poem talks about how his cat brings him captured or killed animals or birds. It doesn't focus on death aspect, but the factual aspect and what it might mean when a kitty puts forth the effort to bring you such a prize. It is a little dark, but the subject matter hides a certian humourous and sweet outlook on life. This seems to be part of Franks personality, it's him and it's his way. A very good read."
4,Don't Let the Title Fool You,"This may seem like a gothy, angst-ridden book at first glance, but while the poems contained herein touch on the subjects that fascinate the aforementioned subculture, overall they provide more a theme of hope and insight than the drear morbidity you'd expect from the cover. E A Poe he is not; Frank delivers a wonderful collection of nifty little poems ranging from no more than a page long in the dimensions of the book (and it's pocket sized! carry it everywhere! even legal to carry onto airplanes!) to a few pages of verse and story that hit all the prime topics a poet is prone to investigate in their meandering through realms of writ and ink. It's good stuff, folks."
2,Fits like a glove but no screen protection.,I admit it is shown clearly in the product photos but I was hoping it was just a trick of the light. While this case fits your Blackberry 8700 like a glove it is totally open over the the keyboard and screen. I was expecting that area to be covered in clear plastic as is normally the case with these kinds of cases. As it is now there is zero protection from scratches or impacts on your screen. Only the sides and back which are the toughest parts already are covered...
1,Not a good case,"I have the Krussel setup for my Razr,including the car adapter which works very well. After I the Blackberry, I wanted to use the same setup for my belt and car. The belt clip is fine, but the case fit on the Blackberry is poor. It is too thick on the sides, such that you cannot get to the buttons easily, especially the thumbwheel. The screen also faces outward, rather than inward for maximum protection, so it's more prone to getting hit or scratched.I would not recommend this case to anyone and wished I would have saved the packaging, so that I could get a refund. As it was a waste of money.Do not purchase this particular case."
2,Not a good buy,It really makes the phone twice the size it already is and its hard to press the buttons on sides. The scroll is hard to get to and you use that for almost everything. I wouldnt purchase it again.
2,Good reason why this book is no longer in print,"Full disclosure - I am a Calvinist. The author of these letters, Randall Foster, was quite negative toward this theological position. In this book, he brings up the ""logical"" fallacies of God decreeing all things. He claims the Westminster Confession is filled with contradictory statements. In all my years of studying theology, I've never seen such dreadfully weak arguments and virulent attitude toward those with whom a fellow Christian disagrees.This book is useful only so far as it stands as a good example of the kind of human, un-biblical argumentation some choose to use against the sovereignty of God His right to be Potter over the clay."
3,Nuts Review,"I love the orchestrated music on this CD, but wish there was more to it. If I didn't love the music so much on this, I would have passed considering the cost. But it's a collector's item, and hard to find. I gave it a rating of 3 due to lack of more music and the price this CD commands in the market. Still, i'm glad I bought it and play it a lot."
1,Jesus Seminar Gone Deconstructionally Amuck,"Yikes! Scott's aproach to the parables of Jesus is part commentary on IF there are His parables, and part deconstruction of said parables. How many people are comfortable with the idea of Jesus telling bawdy stories?Scott, like so many of his colleagues in the Society of Biblical Literature, are so interested in seeming ""objective"" in approaching Scripture, they treat it with less respect than they would any other peice of ancient literature. When was the last time you heard of a Q source for Homer? Or of multiple authors for The Republic? Or a discussion of which lines of The Frogs are original to the play's author? These guys want to look intellectual, but end up looking petty."
5,nice lap,"I was not expected such performance from this lap..I install windows 7 on it and it works very good, without hanging.. thanks to seller"
2,Not fine jewelry,"I was looking for some nice jewelry to give our 14 and 16 year old nieces. This is not it. This will end up as a present for the 10 year old niece because we got it at the Friday sale price of $15. The pendant is smaller than the on-screen picture, smaller even than the fingernail on my ,ittle finger, and the stone is so small it is hard to see.If I had paid the $45 they ask for it regularly I would have been even more disappointed and asked for a refund... evven at only $15 I am tempted to send it back."
3,amethyst pendant,"this is cute and i have the matching earrings. the stone is quite small so it's hard to see the color, but i like it anyway."
3,Jura-Capresso J-5,We have had several of the Jura-Capresso machines. We currently have the Impress J5.We love the coffee and lattes it makes but there is one very annoying and potentially dangerous issue.The frothing tip on the machine flies off intermittently and sprays hot milk on us and allover the cabinets and floor. We make a point of blowing steam through the tip for about 30 secondsafter we make each latte to make certain no milk remains in it to clog it and we also clean thetip in solution as directed -but the problem continues. We had this issue on other Jura-Capressomachines as well so we don't understand why they don't have screw on tips to easily solve this problem.Making lattes has become a stressful event!
3,Stopped Working,"We purchased Kathline and Lacey - one of the bases stopped working within minutes...cute toy and my kids like it, though..."
5,Great series,We are SO addicted to Breaking Bad !! Such a great series....definitely 5 stars + When is the second 1/2 starting?!?
2,breaking bad streaming video,"the sound was out of synch with the video throughout. very disappointing, first time this has happened. not sure I will purchase further episodes."
2,This show is NOT OKAY!,"Its a very violent show that leaves you feeling horrible every time you watch it. The main characters get away with killling, drug dealing...shooting young boys. With all the tragedies in our country, this show is an extremely violent and bad example to the young generation who may be watching. The only proper ending would be for the main characters to get caught by the DEA!"
3,Kinda dull really,This was my first time to watch the new season. I hope the rest of the season is not on this level. Where was the dark humor as well as the Keystone Kops gone gangster as found in previous seasons? I'll give it a couple more epsiodes but based on the writing and plot of this episode I would never have watched any of the previous seasons.Right now I am thinking they should have stopped after season four. We'll see though.
3,"incredible show, incredibly short season","So if you haven't seen the show before, what all your friends tell you is true: it's one of the best on TV right now. The acting, the writing, the plot twists are all very well done. Lots of subtle things to pick up on.I give this 3 stars only because they split season 5 into season 5 and 6 to make more money. Look at the price of this set. Right now it's available for pre order at just under 40 bucks. Well there are only 8 episodes in this. 8 episodes which I'm sure will not wane in quality, but that is still nearly $5 per episode. These episodes are 1.99 each on Amazon instant and I think you can get the whole season for twenty something dollars on iTunes, and be able to watch within a day of the air time. What are they thinking with this?"
5,Chillingly smart and continues to intrigue me.,I've been following Aaron Paul on Twitter. You know a series is great when even the actors don't see what's coming next.
4,What was that all about?,"This was a good season, but just as it began to ramp up, it seemed to stop short. The plot was left dangling."
2,BOOOOOOO,I really don't care at all about this show anymore. but I'm to far invested to not see it through. Thank god it's the last season I just don't want to do this anymore
2,Poor quality,Took a long time to load and then was terrible quality. Very grainy picture. Awful awful awful awful awful awful.
2,Picture quality poor,I love this series and I am not critiquing anything but the picture quality which has been very poor. The movie has to constantly buffer so stops intermittently. I do not have this problem with Netflix. Ever.
4,Suprisingly creative.,Very good show. I love how the writers keep creating hillariously stupid stunts for Walt & Jessie each episode. Could have been a comedy.
5,Epic!,"For anybody who loves drug/mafia/mob movies this show is the epitome of exceptional character development and exceptional plot writing. The transformation of the main character ""Walt"" from high school chemistry teacher diagnosed with cancer to drug king-pin is monumental. Love every second of every episode!"
5,Stick the landing!,"This review is of the first half of the season.Breaking Bad is the best show on TV, and this half-season was some of the finest storytelling of the show's run. The show's technical merit and performances have earned their place in TV history.Unless the climax completely blows the story, this will be in my top 5 of all time. Stunning."
5,Breaking Bad Season 5,"Breaking Bad Season 5 (really the entire series) is really off the charts, it deserves more than five stars, you need to amend your rating system for this show. It's a shame Season 6 doesn't start until July, 2013, and has only eight episodes. This series is better than many Acadmy Award winning movies. The writing and acting are mesmerizing, I don't expect to see another series this good in this lifetime."
5,Amazing!!,This show is nothing less than amazing. Being able to instantly order season 5 and watching it when I had free time was very convenient. Amazon video is great.
5,Smart and well done!,"Once I started watching it, I couldn't stop! Walt was smart, ominous and good, faithful, drawing you in with inconspicuous force... And Jesse, lovable at first site, yo... All of the characters were so good!"
5,One of the best dramas out there.,"Breaking bad is great because it is unpredictable and does not follow a formula. It's full of ""I cannot believe they just did that"" moments. But the acting is the main draw. It has ruined almost all every other TV experience for me because I see actors playing parts. In Breaking Bad, Brian Cranston IS Walter White and Aaron Paul IS Jessie Pinkman. Wrong on so many levels but THE BEST as far as acting and entertainment that is out there right now. The story really is unbelievable but I BUY IT, hook, line and sinker! It's that good."
5,"Well written, well performed.","Well written, well performed. Can't wait to see what happens next and I hate that Season 5 is the last season."
4,Great First Half!! Can't Wait For Part 2,"The Final Season of Breaking Bad is upon us... slim to no spoilersWalt is now king and what a ride it will be.Damn Dish for not having AMC, anyway...Some episodes can be slow, especially anything that involves Skyler lol.There are some great moments, Magnets Yo! and Jesse is becoming wiser under Mike's wing. Walt is becoming more cold hearted by the episode and greedy, will this be his downfall? There are many twists and shocks in the episodes of the first half that won't disappoint any fan of Breaking Bad, can't wait for part 2 of season 5!"
4,"Great series, can't wait for season 5","I really enjoyed catching up on the first four seasons of Breaking Bad. I'm excited for season 5, but thinking I might wait until it is all available before watching. I'm not sure if I can handle waiting a week between episodes."
5,The End is Near,I'm sorry this will be over soon.I rate this series at the top along with The Sopranos and Deadwood.
5,Amazing,If you haven't seen any other season of breaking bad...SHAME on you!! go back and get season 1... If you have seen all other seasons then you don't need a review to know you are going to buy this so why are you even reading this???
4,Addictive Series,"I couldn't wait for more to come out on Netflix, so I had to buy the series on Amazon. The series is engrossing and keeps your attention. It is definitely winding down and not quite as thrilling as the first few seasons."
5,love it,It keeps you so into what might happen next. watched season 4 too. Can't wait for season 5 to come out!!
4,This Sucks,"I LOVE this show!!!!! The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is because we are being ripped off!! (not by Amazon but by the studio), I now have to wait another year for the final part of the final season?!?!?!?!?!?"
4,Darkest yet!,"The story line in season five is probably the darkest of all the seasons. Walt and Jesse, who have always managed to maintain some sense of morals and values, - a quality which has kept them likeable and real - are close to losing touch with who they were in season 5. Am particularly troubled by the ""say my name"" episode in which Walt exalts himself into some kind of meth cook god status. Unless next season presents a Walt and Jesse who can find some semblance of individuals who know right from wrong AND can refrain from the wrong (rather than revel in it)- season 6 may be the last Breaking Bad Season for me!"
4,breaking bad season5,"Walt is on fire,taking out anyone and anything that gets in his way.His ruthless and elaborate tactics are borderline on genius and demonic at the same Damn time,which gives him the ultimate edge above the rest.Talk about playing real life chess,Walt uses just about every pawn at his disposal...I only wonder what he has in store for his DEA agent brother-in-law who seems to be getting wise to""The Great Heisenberg""..."
4,Where are the writers going ??,"This series has kept my attention for 4 seasons - but - killing off all his infastructure - Whats Walter White thinking - hope he can get it together - Me thinks its too late, now that the east Europeans are involved - and Walt wants out - ha ha ha.Cant wait for the next oneMike"
5,THE Best show on television!!!,"The best writing and acting in television period!!! Highly recommend this gritty and raw story about a highly intelligent, passive High School chemistry teacher, who turns seriously Bad Ass after finding out he has cancer around his 50th birthday! Multiple plot turns will keep you on the edge of your seat! Watch it!!!"
4,Same greatness,"Did not miss a beat. Can't wait for 2nd half of season. Character development culminates with telling, and rich scenes."
5,Great show,I'm crazy about this show! I paid a great price for season 5. I was very happy with everything involved
5,"It's dark and shocking, but oh so good!",Strong performances by some of the best actors on the small screen. The characters are so well written and played that this long running dark and gritty story takes you along for a wild ride. You just can't stop watching because the creators of this saga brilliantly pulled you in back in season one. This is the BEST long running serial I have ever watched! Alot of people are suprised when you say you watch this faithfully and frankly I'm stunned that I love it so much. Just watch it from the beginning!
4,Leaves you wanting more,"The ending of this season just makes you want to see more. Great show, Great cast but I would have liked to see it go in a different direction."
5,Breaking Bad FANTASTIC,Its ashame it has to end after season 6.They should make a movie !!!!!Was pleasantly surprised from season 1 episode 1.
5,Amazing show!,"This is one of the best television series ever, giving the best entertainment and production value. The cast is incredibly talented, as is the production crew. The subject matter may not be for everyone, but is absolutely worth giving it a try. Watch this show!! The only thing you'll regret is the empty feeling you'll have while waiting for the final season to start."
3,the playback kept skipping,The show was great but it was really frustrating when it would skip or altogether freeze my computer. This happened numerous times on different devices.
4,Always excellent,This series never disappoints accept for the fact that season 5 was only 8 episodes! I'd like to have a job like that where I only have to work for possibly 3 months! Seriously 8 episodes! Ridiculous!
4,Disappointed with the HD quality,"I love the show but the quality of HD hasn't been good as it keeps stopping the feed of the show stating that the bandwith is slow. We have Verizon FIOS and have the highest speed available, so not sure why we paid extra to not be able to watch it in HD"
4,Very good at this point,"So far, it is an excelent show. Other seasons have been better but I am not quite finished this season yet so I won't be too quick to judge."
5,Very nice show,"I couldn't resist the temptation, I actually watched all of it In two days, that means four episodes a day. It's the best show I ever followed. Just wish it wouldn't end. Very good quality with HD."
5,More spine-tingling than a 5-Star Film,"I watched all 5 seasons over two weeks. Just when you think it couldn't get better, it eclipses all other tv dramas. You won't regret it."
5,Fantastic Show,"Every time Breaking Bad ends a season, it gets better and better. Season 5 was no different.The difference this time was each episode in the season was amazing, including Say My Name. No filler shows this time around."
5,Breaking bad,Love this show. Cant wait till next season starts. Hurry up and get here. Walter is an evil man. Love to hate him.
4,Breaking Bad is a fantastic series~ the only reason that I don't give it 5 stars is that Skylers character is very lack luster.,The only reason that I don't give it 5 stars is that Skylers character is very lack luster & boreing in season 5. They could have portrayed her much better.
2,No closed caption or subtitles,This is too expensive for not having cc. Nowadays all services of this type have at least english subtitles. I will avoid using amazon for watching shows while they don't fix this.
5,Great,The whole Breaking Bad series is simply a masterpiece. If you have yet to watch it please start at the beginning.
5,GREAT,"This is the best season. I am just so sad that it's the last season. And since DISH cut out AMC, this is the very best way to watch those shows! Thanks Amazon!"
5,Compelling,"This is one of those TV shows that is habit forming. That's why I had to buy the 4th season... I couldn't wait to watch it one week at a time. Great cast, writing, story, direction. It's a lesson in how to write and direct."
4,No caption,"Breaking bad from Amazon is still a Rey good show, but difficult to understand some of the conversationsp. Would be much much better with captioning. a good job of restarting the ,dope scheme'. Bbj"
2,The show is great but...,The episode was great but there were constant streaming issues despite having internet speed @ 19.53/Mbits. Something just wasn't working right. The constant errors and stoppage made watching it impossible when using my PS3. The help center was great though and my money was refunded. I had such a poor experience I'm not sure I'll try again but we'll see.
2,quality,"Love the show. Unfortunately, the quality of the video from Amazon was quite poor. The audio was okay, but the video was pixelated and had abrupt color changes."
4,Good but not quite as good as previous seasons,The first 4 seasons were all riveting. The first few episodes of season 5 were a little slow but it picked up in good shape by the end of episode 8. Looking forward to the last 5.
5,Breaking Bad,"fantastic....loved it....even though we had to pay for it, it was worth it. want the whole season to continue. again loved it"
4,Cannot stop watching!,As always this show draws you in an won't let go. I will be sad when this series ends. The fifth season builds slow and I suspect it will end with a bang.
5,A Greek tragedy,"Don't let the subject matter put you off from one of the best shows on TV. This isn't about meth, this is about the morality of a man and how his continual bad decisions turn him into a monster. It's not all dark and grim either - there is some signs of hope and redemption of one of the charicters.I resisted watching this show because of the subject matter, but I'm glad I got over it and watched this near perfect show."
5,Five Stars for Breaking Bad Season 5,This has been one of my favorite series; and season 5 is living up to the past 4 seasons . . . . totally.
4,Breaking Bad,"What a show! Not as edgey as the 4th season, but really, what could top the 4th. The personality cracks of Walt and Skylar, Jesse and Mike are now more apparent and established in this short--8 episode--season and the brutal tragic end to their surreal fantasy is looming."
5,We hope there is more to come,"This season was excellent and, if there's no viable way to continue the storyline without sacrificing the quality and integrity of the storyline, this may be the perfect ending to one of my favorite tv shows. However I hope there's more to come!Netflix is a better format, ps!"
4,season 5 - not like the others,love the show. season five offers more character development than past seasons. still in the middle of Five and hoping for more excitement ahead.
5,Breaking Bad Excellent to the End,"I have been watching this season of BB thru Amazon IV because of my provider Dish-TV's ongoing dispute with AMC. I hate paying twice for anything, but I have followed this series from the beginning. It is fine t.v. along with Boss, another one that has me hooked.This season in my opinion is the best ever with slick direction and camera work, dramatic, more intense focus on the central characters.Walt's metamorphosis into criminality is completed. Mike is the consummate mafioso type. Jesse the conscience. Skylar a wild card lurking in the background. Hank a bulldog who may yet somehow discover the wiretap. Who knows how this will end, there are so many directions it could take.I will really miss it when it ends even though it is costing me $1.99/episode! Money well-spent."
5,Amazing!,Most amazing show ever period. The production value per episode is great like watching a 45min mini movie.highly recommended if you likr crime dramas
1,Can't Even View It!,"I purchased Season 4 in April and 'consumed' it all in a weekend! So I bought Season 5 and find out Amazon no longer supports the Android Tablet!!! CAN'T EVEN WATCH IT! Amazon, come on, don't make us buy a ""Kindle"" or Ipad!"
1,I Unfourtunately Jumped On The Bandwagon,"THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT I DOWNLOADED BECAUSE OF ALL OF THESE WEIRD POSTERSAND GIANACARLO ESPISITO (BACK IN THE DAY)I HAVE NOT WATCHED THE SERIESYET, BUT I HAVE ALL OF THE EPISODES, WAITING UNTIL SERIES FINALE TO VIEW SOMY OPINION DOESN'T SWAY MY THOUGHT S ON CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, REALLY LIKETHE POSTERS I'VE SEEN 4 THE PRODUCT THOUGH"
2,Breaking Bad season 5,"I love this show, and after I moved Dish Net, and AMC are fighting, so I can't get this on AMC anymore, also when the Walking Dead starts I will have to get it the same way, the only problem I have is the picture doesn't fit the screen, the seen is set to high, I tried to correct it but I can do nothing to change it. but because I lov the show I can deal with it. thanks Gary"
5,Great Season,Season 5 shows why its cakes breaking bad and not breaking nice. Watch and enjoy after this you really wanna see season 6
5,Season five and still got it,"I have enjoyed Breaking Bad since I first started watching it, and I honestly had my doubts about this season. I should not have worried. The first half of Season Five was gripping television, and I highly recommend it.The HD episodes via streaming were flawless. There were no glitches or halts, and on my 28 inch monitor the picture quality was superb. The viewing experience was literally as nice as watching on my home theatre setup. This is the first time I've purchased a streaming video product, and based upon this experience, I will do so again.Most excellent!"
5,Best Show Ever About A Chemistry Teacher Turned Drug Dealer,"This entire series has been remarkable. It is a morality play, black comedy, situation comedy, and Greek tragedy all rolled into one. I have enjoyed every minute of the series. ""His life was gentleand the elementsSo mixed in him, that Nature might stand up, And say to all the world, THIS WAS A MAN!"" Shakespeare could have been speaking about Walter White."
3,Ok,Nice. Can't wait to watch season five! It's going to be insane!Just a boring preview! But hey it is free!
5,Breaking Bad is Bad A**!,"This season picks up right where season 4 left off. Since Walt eliminated ""Gus"" from last season, there is a void in leadership and production. Season 5 focuses on how Walt, Jesse, and Mike join forces to restart the business, but do it in a way that ""breaks"" new ground. A number of the episodes highlight their ability to come up with creative solutions to complex problems. Season 5 highlights Walt's insatiable drive to create a powerful drug empire.The writers, directors, actors, and cinematographers all seem to be reaching their ""creative stride."" The show is more engaging and compelling than ever! It is definitely ""must see"" television!"
5,Exceptional,Best series on TV today. Cant wait to see what happens in the final episodes of season 5. Worth paying to see.
5,awesome,"Breaking Bad just gets better and better. Jesse's character is more deeply developed here, and Walter's goes through a large spectrum of emotion and circumstance."
5,Greatest show ever! Thats all!,Great show. Full of violence but without a doubt one of the best shows on TV. Can't wait for the final season.
5,Breaking Bad,We have become a HUGE fan of Breaking Bad late in the season so we are thrilled to be caught up and looking forward to it starting up again next summer.
2,uneventful,What a boring season I'm so disappoints .there was no point . Was there always only 8 episodes .hope better next year
4,Watched on Amazon due to Dish Blackout,We watched season 5 on Amazon due to Dishnetwork dropping AMC. It would be nice if Amazon could get hooked up with Western Digital so we could watch on our WD box. This is primarily Western Digital's problem. Is there anything Amazon could do to get them to add Amazon streaming video to its complement of services?
5,Great!!!,Every episode leaves me wanting more... So good....I definitely would recommend.. As the episodes move ahead you don't know what to expect.... Keeps getting better and better.
5,Breaking Bad Season 5,"This is a spellbinding series that could be your neighbor! Just can't watch it over enough to grasp it's impact. Every session is as good as the last one, every session leaves you on the edge of your seat! Real, Raw, one of the best I have ever watched."
4,three good episodes and two duds so far,I just cant stand Skylar this season. She makes no sense and is making me crazy. First 3 episodes were great then crap for 4 and 5. Haven't finished any others so still hopefull.
5,"Breaking Bad season 5, episode 8","I am not sure how I managed to miss this episode on TV. So I had to buy it.Well now I can't wait for the follow up in spring 2013, I beleive."
5,AWESOME SHOW!!!,This is just a preview for season 5 of Breaking Bad. I've been waiting for this season for a long time!!! I just love this show and season 5 looks like its gonna be really really good!!!
5,Breaking Bad Season 5,"This show is so crazy, it is very hard to walk away from it. I spent four hours watching Breaking Bad one day and I would do it again."
5,Breaking Bad Rocks!,Such great acting! I love this show! We lived in Albuquerque and it is so cool to see something filmed there!
4,Was hoping for more after Season 4 closer,"I have watched and loved this show from the beginning, but I have to say this one wasn't the best I've seen. Walt's oversight regarding the camera was surprising given the level of detail with which he has conducted business up until now. Especially given his annoyance at Gus using the camera to track his every move. Knowing Gus as he did, it should have been obvious there would be a record somewhere. Of course, had Walt thought to look for the storage device before torching the lab, we wouldn't have been treated to the excitement of the giant magnet. I did enjoy seeing the three guys working together; Mike is a great character."
3,Walt is so bad now!,"The streaming quality was awful for a purchased show so hd is a must I guess..Man, I despise Walt this season so far (but only 1 episode so maybe he gets better...)"
4,Worthy of the show,Show is well done and is teasing with you the end at the beginning of the first episode. The characters continue to develop and there is a pretty big surprise.
5,Best Show ever made,"I'm glad I took my friends' advice and starting watching Breaking Bad. I watched the first four seasons on Netflix and bought the first half of season five through Amazon. I prefer Netflix because it runs better on my IPad but the show itself deserves 6 stars, an I'm obsessed with category! Although I was bummed Gus died, he was so badass"
3,Just not into this anymore,We already know this is not going to come to a good end. What is the point of watching any more?
3,Not loving Mr. White,"I don't know what happened between the fourth series and the fifth. The fourth had me on the edge of my seat and slapped on the face nearly every episode. The fifth series Mr. White is just a despicable person, His once lovely wife seems to be along for the ride. I don't know why I'm watching it anymore."
5,As addicting as drugs!,I watched all four seasons in a space of about six weeks-after my son told me about it-and was blown away-no pun intended-when I saw the last episode of season four. I am pacing myself with the first part of season five so that I can watch it on AMC in the summer.
3,So far not as good as season 1 thru 4,"Seems like a lot more action on previous seasons.I dont really care for the high speed action.Still enjoy watching,when the time is right , I will watch the remaning episodes."
5,Breaking Bad 8 or more stars,Breaking Bad was one of the best shows I have ever seen. I would have given Breaking Bad many more stars but I was only allowed 5 stars.
1,unhappy with amazon.com digital download,"I would not have made this digital purchase from Amazon.com had I known Closed Captions were not available. I watched the first 4 seasons of Breaking Bad on Netflix and was completely satisfied. I have been unable to understand virtually any of episodes 1 & 2 of season 5, and have completely given up with even trying to watch the remaining 6 episodes. Additionally, I experienced frequent periods where there were 30 seconds of streaming followed by 15 seconds of downloading then another brief period of streaming followed by more downloading. These cycles often went on for 8 - 10 minutes. I would not recommend Amazon.com digital downloads to anyone. As far as the content of Breaking Bad Season 5, I gave it one star due to both audio and video problems which made the 2 episodes incomprehensible to me."
3,what the?,subpar plotline compared to season 4 and 5. they should have quit while they were ahead and done a movie instead.
1,Extremely disappointed,"The quality of Amazon's video is much inferior to Netflix on my Roku device.I opted for the more expensive HD version of Breaking Bad on Amazon Prime, but the quality was miserable. If customer service means anything to Amazon, you should offer me a refund. I will definitely NOT be using Amazon Prime in the future.But thanks for asking.Despite Amazon's lousy video quality, Breaking Bad is definitely one of the best TV shows ever produced!"
1,I never bought the item,Somebody please tell me how I was asked to review Breaking Bad when I never purchased it. Did someone steal my cc number? My identity?!
1,Price verses quality was 0 over 0,Extremely over priced for the quality of transmission. Do not buy. Tried three different times same result every time. Will never buy again
