4,A good writing tool.,"This is a top shelf book in my writers tool box. It is clear, concise, and informative. It has many good examples, and its flow chart approach to identifying and correcting typical grammar errors is easy to use. As a new writer, I find this book very helpful."
5,A rule of thumb,A formidable book aimed at helping young students to master the rules and syntax of the English grammar.
4,A gift,This was bough as a gift so I can't say mug about t though I do know there was slight disappointment since only used was available and it looked kind of beat up. Other than that I believe it served its purpose well enough.
2,Wrong book,I ordered the book because it was the book I needed and it was the correct book on the picture but when I received it it was an older edition I believe. Same book but you should have just put the picture of the thee book instead of the one it has now....Other than that price was god and shipping was fast.
5,Rules for Writers,"The book that I purchased Rules for Writers has helped me tremedously with my writing projects. The book that I received was in excellent condition and the process was quick and delivery was great. This is the 2nd time that I ordered through the Amazon, and I will continue to do so, the prices, condition of the book and the delivery is wonderful."
5,Rules for Writers 6th Ed - Diana Hacker,"If you are a college student, you have GOT to get your hands on this book. APA formatting and loaded with info. Document Design, Grammar, Punctuation, Academic Writing, Conducting Research, MLA writing format, AND its a SPIRAL bound book - lays flat on any open page to review and type at the same time. A++, 5-Stars, Absolutely the best reference book that I have on my shelves ! Saves you hours of web surfing to find an answer ! Makes a great inserted reference for your word documents ! I use it daily !"
4,Good College Book,"I have used this book during my college writing class, and I definitly learned about how to avoid a few gammar mistakes. The best way I can think to use this book is to read over previous works of writing( or get someone with a trained eye) and find common grammar mistakes. Then use the book to figure out how to fix them."
4,Brand New,"Even though I have not use it once yet, I will be benefit from it for more than years. Customer satisfaction seems guaranteed."
3,"""For students"" is right","While this may indeed be handy for students working on papers, I found it too cumbersome for daily on-the-job reference. My fault for buying it without giving it a thorough look.The detailed index is nicely done.This one will go back to the store, to be replaced with Karen Gordon's Transitive Vampire. Meanwhile, I'll stick with Strunk."
3,The least imperfect of available handbooks on grammar.,"Retains most of the necessary regulations, but permits the split infinitive: p. 113: ""We decided actually to enforce the law"" IS perfectly natural; those who disagree should revise to ""We decided that we should actually enforce the law."" Also, indefinite singulars, like ""everyone"" should never be equated with ""their""! ""Everyone"" always must equal ""he or she."" I shall require the text again for my Quality Composition course, but with a lengthy note-sheet of qualifications."
2,Feminism has no place in such a book,"This book has some good information in it but it was a turn off when the author deals with gender and pronouns. She correctly states that to use ""they"" when referring to a singular person is incorrect. She advocates that singular pronouns also be avoided when the person to which it refers is unknown. She states that the use of the masculine pronoun in such cases is ""offensive"". This is a change in the rules of English grammer. She has allowed her feminist views to influence the book. I found this book distastful for this reason because I don't like this kind of propaganda and especially dislike the use of this book as a vehicle to promote the feminist agenda."
4,I will never be the same,"i just got this cd.where have the the prayer boat been all my life?i dream their music.finally a band who is unique,talented and emotional.a singer who really can sing!i have no words to say how beautiful this cd is.you will just have to get it and experience it yourself."
3,Hebrew-English Bible,It is good but it translates word for word and the Hebrew is verbatim. The Hebrew meaning just doesn't come through.
3,"too bad, it had a great potential","Funkstar de Luxe picked absolutely amazing songs for his album. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the execution of these great songs into his hard-hitting, funky, house music was a bit short of perfection. Funkstar's style is a bit repetitive and predictible, so, listening to the entire album at once is not as exciting as one may have thought looking at the phenomenal song list. In addition, the songs aren't continuous. I like albums that are seamless/continuous between songs because I want to know the DJ's ability/capability to pick different music and mix them. I guess if you're into mainstream house music for dancing, you will like this album. If you are like me, who likes to pay special attention to the DJ's talent in his mixing abilities, this album will be a disspointment. Did I already say this album is very repetitive in its style?"
2,OKAY - BUT NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"This book is an easy read. I found many of the stories very interesting but for the most part I thought the book was rather boring. Some of the things I read I already heard about throughout the years and yet there were some that I had never heard. If you are really into the ""new"" NASCAR you might find this book interesting. Again - it was okay but not what I expected."
1,Inadequate and dull,"An expose of the network that replaced News with lies and deception? Not at all. Everything suggests Faux News paid for this book to draw readers away from in depth inquiries.Kimmel must have been working from clippings, because you won't find any personalities here. The people who made Fox are characterless names. Fox may not have news but at least they are entertaining. This text provides neither one."
1,Too wordy,"It should have been a wonderful book. The story is great; its the telling that is terrible. She uses too much description. It does not seem realistic, not even close. In the beginning she writes that Kathy can't gain weight, and eats whatever she wants, in huge quantities. Two chapters later Kathy is buying a dress saying she is either a size 10 or 12 depending on whether she ate a danish or not.Usually I can read a book in a day, if its a great book and I have the time. So far I have been reading this book for 2 weeks! It is very easy to put down. I find myself watching tv commercials instead of reading. Save yourself the agony of reading this and choose a book by Nora Roberts."
1,Wish I had received the books,"I have seen Christie speak, and saw her most recent presentation based on this book. I am always impressed with her ability to explain the marketing approach, and put it into actionable steps. I ordered 10 copies to give to my senior managers and a couple of key customers for Christmas. I was disappointed that the shipment never arrived, and they had no more to replace them. Amazon was great, and I got a full refund immediately, but I really wanted the books!"
1,Don't bother!,"This book cries out: for a proof-reader, an editor, and a really good therapist for the ""author."" As Nancy Truax herself asserts, she's college educated and details count: so how do you explain a ""one carrot diamond?""And the reason for this book's publication would be....catharsis?If you're dying to read a good book about women's history and struggle for equality, please buy Lalita Tademy's CANE RIVER. The women in her book are black, born into slavery and have a story to tell. Poor Nancy~ white, middle-class and with a choice about where she works...The good-ol'-boys club needs some serious re-vamping; I know because I was one of the women police officers who worked with Nancy. What I can't understand is how she makes excuse after excuse for an abusive husband, but is mad as hell at the men she works with who treat her as badly, or even just indifferently. Please Nancy, get a therapist before you write another book."
1,This is a terrible read.,"This is the worst book I have ever read. Where was the proofreader and editor before this book was published? By talking to contacts in the Portsmouth, NH area I also learned that this publication is, very much, fictional. Apparently, although certain stated facts were true, such as her employment and status, most everything else was a far stretch of the truth. Apparently most of the events cited in the book never happened or were vastly over stated. This book was a BIG disappointment."
3,"If you know about the PPD, you do not have to read the book","I personally I have not read Nancy's book but I would like to get ahold of her to discuss a situation our family has with the PPD. I have read he other reviews and I bet they are all from PPD officers who wish to cover themselves or just so they can continue to be an officer. Certianly everyone has heard the old expression that birds of feather stick together. Anyone who says anything bad about the PPD is going to end up being harrassed. I could certianly share information about them that the community would never believe because they think the police are there to help them and they are not. They are trained liars, which in my opinion makes them no different than the criminals they arrest. I gave her 3 stars just for standing up for herself and editing problems are not really what the book is about now is it?"
4,comprehensive,Seems to be the authority on C++. Gives all the details. Can be a little much if just learning C++.
4,it's a good book.,I liked the way the author wrote it and the point of view he wrote it at. It was my first time warp trio book and it made me want to read more. Another book I liked was Da wild Da crazy Da Vinci. There's tons more books in the series and I can't wait to read them!
3,One problem....,STOP TALKING SO MUCH! Nothing can ruin a CD as bad as a chatty DJ. There should be another version of this CD where he plays with Duct tape over his mouth.I'm going back to Tony Touch.
2,DJ Clue = Loudmouth,"If DJ Clue could keep himself from shouting the most annoying interjections every 5 seconds of every song, this CD would probably be one of my favorites. Almost all the tracks are really good, but DJ Clue successfully ruins every single one by either giving himself props every few seconds, telling us who's MC, or just yelling ...with his stupid stadium effect mic. CD is a would-be-good, but loudmouth Clue makes it a waste of money."
2,it is sooooooooooo annoying,"thr pros about this album s that there alot of tight rappers and beats the cons about this album is that clue calls himself a dj but he's a dumb phony who doesn't know when to shut his mouth all he does is yell out throughout the whole album saying stupid stuff and giving shoutouts while the rappers rap he nees o shut up an lets us hear the song if u want this album still, go copy it off the net cause the is not worth the money ohyeah he dosen't even scratch"
3,DuVII,This is not a bad album...there are definitely some good tracks on it but I have to agree with the people saying his annoying voice ruins those songs. If it wasn't for his connections he wouldn't be where he is now in the rap game.
2,Disappointment....,"Wow...Clue REALLY changed his style from the last professional huh?!Man, that's just ker-a-z. The last album was better but i guess this one wuz ""AAIGHT""..not exactly somethin you'd wanna waste your money on though..i just peeped the trax offa amazon and just listened to a few seconds of it but uhh...a few seconds still makes a difference..yea..i'm really feelin that ""Change the game"" single with Jay-z.That single is HYPED..sounds like the only tight songs on this cd are THAT (change the game),What the beat, the best of Queenz, and maybe even..the Trick Daddy song if i can get a listen but uhh..that's about it..just FOUR songs..but hey..different strokes fo' different folkz right? I wouldn't reccomend this but u can peep it if u want.Peace."
2,"SHUT YOUR MOUTH, CLUE !","What a waste of a good CD. Clue knows exactly to chime in on his songs with stupid ""Yeah!"" ""DJ Clue!"" and other inane comments. At the start, in the middle, towards the end, it don't matter to him.Clue, we already bought the stupid CD, theres no need to advertise anymore!If your going to blast these songs in your ride, get ready to start bleeding from your ears once he chimes in with all his echo voice idiocy."
1,Worst I have heard in a long time,"I am a BIG DJ Clue fan, or should I say WAS>>> I was so (mad) at this cd. Every song starts out the SAME way.. He sounds like a broken record.... I mean I know he wants us to know who the RAPPER is but good Lord.... I gave the CD to a friend... I own around 600 cd's, and it wasn't even worthy of joining my collection.... I hope this helps you so that you don't waste that (money)like I did.... Spend it on something better like D-12!!!!!!!"
2,This CD is pure fluff,"Aside from the Raekwon, Ghostface collaboration, this CD is a surefire enema waiting to happen. Just don't slip this one on the hi-fi when you're entertaining one evening. You'll be kicked off the social register for sure.And what is the deal with DJ Clue's constant yappering in between cuts? I thought DJ's were supposed to be quiet and PLAY RECORDS, not yell out shots to his granny, his momma, his momma's uncle, cousin PeeWee, Crazy Lester, Lester's baby's momma, and so on and so on. Save it for the liner notes, Mr. Clue."
4,Italian Ice,"This album is hot, no doubt. The songs, the freestyles, pretty much everything. However, when I listened to the CD I got very sick of hearing ""New Sh*t"", ""CLUE"", ""Mad Shout"", etc. because I would much rather hear the song with no one talking over it. The album's hottest tracks are Beans & Freeway ""Coming For You"", Redman ""RED"", and Mary J. & Jadakiss ""Back 2 Life 2001""."
3,Hot...but for how long???,"DJ clue did his thing with this one. All the top names in the hip hop industry are here: Jay-Z, Nas, Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Lil Kim and even a new comer (Billy Bathgate). This album hits you hard from the start. I found myself a little overwhelmed with all of this new music from some of my favorite artist. But unfortunately, after the third listen... the album lost its' flare with me. I only listen to certain songs and I find that I'am skipping too many to say that this is an excellent album. My advice....if your not a hard credit and you just want some new music...this should do you well."
1,DJ CLUE (BOO),"DJ.CLUE has no clue of what is is doing. First off he is wack, no doubt about it, this is true. Second I think he could learn a thing or two from Tony Touch. He is real. I don't understand want the music world is going though right now but someone needs to get it together quick,fast and in a hurry because people can't keep listing to mess like this. If DJ Clue was in Iraq and he put out this kind of c.d he would have his hands cut off. To be honest he needs them to be cut off right now. Yes DJ Clue has made it into my wack list along with others."
1,WHACK RAP B.S. LIKE MOST OF TODAY'S MUSIC,"DJ CLUE NEW ALBUM REPESENTS EVERYTHING THAT IS WRONG IN HIP HOP TODAY. MAINSTREEM RAPPERS SAYING RHYMES OVER AND OVER (NOTHING NEW) LIKE THE ROOTS SAYS. THE ONLY OK TRACKS ON IT ARE CREAM 2001 WITH GHOSTFACE AND RAEKWON KICKING ILL VERSES OVER A WHACK BEAT BY CLUE, AND BUSTA AND RAW DIGGA TRACK. EVERYTHING ELSE IS GARBAGE ON THE ALBUM. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP. GO PICK UP THAT SELF SCIENTIFIC ALBUM ""THE SELF SCIENCE"" IF YOU WANT REAL HIP HOP. PEACE"
1,WEAK..............,"I used to bragg about this man skills. Maybe he had the flu or something. Then there would be an excuse for the wackest joint I've heard in a long time. If I could have I would have given this CD one minus. ** WARNING, EXTREMELY WEAK CD. PROCEED WITH CAUTION **"
3,lets lose the voice clue,"ok the dj clue cds are by far the best cds out there they have the best rappers with great songs all in one cd one problem though......clue u gotta stop talkin during songs its real annoying i would have given the review 5 stars but his voice has to deduct 2 of them.......his voice only comes in handy in the song what the beat with method man, eminem, & royce da 5-9 other than that its useless we know what cd were playing u dont have to remind us clue-mike"
4,Clue's voice dosen't annoy me...........,"Yo, this is a great album. Mary J., The LOX, DMX, Freeway, Beanie Sigel, Jay Z, Queensbridge,Cam'ron, Fabolous, Flipmode(some of them anyway),Raeqwan, Ghostface(I don't particulary like this guy I think he is wack), Slim Shady, Royce, Meth, The Dogg Pound, Some of SNS, Foxy Brown, Lil Kim, Memph Bleek, CNN(part of QB), Mobb Deep(partof qb too), and Redman make this album attractive to almost all rap fans. The Jay-Z freestyle is weak, But everything on this is tight except The Foxy Brown and Lil Kim songs everything else is straight. The hottest tracks are RED(Redman), What da beat(Method Man, Royce, and Em),Coming for you(B.Sigel and Free), and Best of Queens[IMD, (Mobb Deep that is)]."
2,Track selection good worst DJ ever,"If this guy has the guption to call himself a dj well then Barney could be a DJ that same repeated sample throughout this LP shows just how much talent he has. he has a very good compilation of artists on this but, he lacks in turntabalism, have DJs sold out like MCs now?"
3,If Not For This Guy,"I bought this album because of the MCs featured. The beats are stellar, but I find it hard to bump along with DJ Clue's irritating and nonsensical shouts, which are littered all over this album. Anyway, once bitten twice shy. I would give DJ Clue's album a miss if he still insists on making himself heard in this most inappropriate manner."
1,Annoying voice ruins great songs,"This cd has some really great songs, but DJ Clue just totally ruined the songs for me yelling through the beginning and often right in the middle of songs. If you're going to by a DJ's cd, buy one made by someone who knows how to."
4,Good Quality Material,"DJ Clue has recieved an unfair rap over the last year. His CD is the best chance to catch hip hop at its best. Rappers rap 1 or at most 2 tracks and lay it all out. All most every song was hot. Only So Hot and Chinatown were misses. For those who love phat beats and crisp tight lyrics, cop this. And cop it quick."
2,This is DJ Clue? Funny - he doesnt do much!,"DJ clue - the name would suggest that he could DJ , however, this just aint true. If you're lookin for good DJ skills (mixin, scratchin etc.) - don't look here, try Jam Master Jay, DJ Babu, even DJ Lethal! However, if you look past the fact that the man has little DJing talent, and ignore his annoying voice for 30 seconds per song, the actual tracks are pretty tite. The Jay-z freestyle is brilliant, the Nas and Mobb Deep tracks are both amazing, and the rest are pretty good as well."
1,If you want to hear a real rap mix CD...,"...pick up Soundbombing 2 on Rawkus Records. You'll not only hear some high-quality hip hop, but there's no yapping between or over the tracks, and the tracks are actually BEAT-MIXED, like a dance mix CD. I never thought rap mix CDs could be done in this fashion, but Soundbombing 2 pulled it off, giving me hope that not all hip-hop DJs are unskilled hacks like Clue or Funkmaster Flex."
5,A Beautifully Told Story of an Interesting Life,"Isabel Allende by Mary Main is a most interesting book. Ms. Allende has lived a fascinating life and triumphed over adversity. What makes this book so special is its balance between talking about Allende's work, and the telling of her life story. The author's tone is informative, interesting and compelling. This book would be an excellent choice for anyone- adult or child- interested in learning more about Isabel Allende.I highly recommend it."
5,Isabel Allende,"Mary Main knows how to tell a story-an especially valuable gift when it comes to writing biography. The author captures the spirit of Isabel Allende, from her early years in Peru and Chile to her life in America. And along the way, she shows us what it is like to create a great novel and how it is possible to overcome suffering and live with grace. This is a compelling and stunning book, one that's guaranteed to intrigue young readers."
5,Best Bra Ever,"I'm the pickiest person in the world when it comes to bras. Comfort is a must and I never care what they look like. The is the most comfortable bra I've ever come across. Sadly the stores in my local area have quit carrying it and I hope that doesn't mean they quit making it. I've searched years for this kind of bra, I'd hate to start over."
4,good stuff,"articulate modern poetry, a bit disjointed for me, but the person i got it for will love it."
4,"Not splendid throughout, but good enough.....","At his best, this poet is one of the best of his generation. Certainly more bookish than Kerouac or Bukowski (and perhaps even moreso than Ginsberg and Burroughs) this poet in this book is allowed to be more relevant because... well... he's still alive....Some of the poems in here are wonderful and could stand beside the best of any other poet. As in most anthologies, though, some are forgettable and would be best exised and forgotten. Those are few in number but they keep me from giving the whole book a five star review...If you like the 'beat generation' but are full with the more well-known writers (not that this poet is in any way unknown) this might be a good book to check out...."
5,The Work That Keeps On Giving,"Ferlinghetti's work is still being read by aspiring poets and artists at poetry readings all across America. I am still impressed no matter how many times I hear different poets read ""I Am Waiting."" For this poem alone the book is required reading, however the work ripples with great poems. If you love the spoken word or just reading poetry in a book, this work is an icon of modern American literature. Don't miss it."
4,His arms around the world.,"Ferlinghetti is a man with his arms around the world.These poems are still moving after more than 40 years. The poem I Am Waiting is typical of all the other writing in this small book. In this piece, he is waiting for a rebirth of wonder in man. The love of the innocence and of the wonder in his fellow man is a fine thing to say in poetry. Get outta here, Ferlinghetti!"
3,Beginner's beat,"I'll begin by saying I'm not a big fan of beat poetry. I'm even less of a fan of mediocre beat poetry. While I'm not entirely comfortable calling Ferlinghetti's work ""beat"" in the strictest sense of the term (as if ""beat"" and ""strict"" should turn up in the same sentence), it is a sort of proto-beat which shows the promise (if you like beat poetry, ""shadow"" or ""spectre"" if you don't) of later poets.Nothing to scream about, but not the worse book of verse I've ever read."
2,"Unlike others, I am not impressed","After purchasing this book on recommendation of a good friend I was highly expectant - almost excited. I expected a labyrinth of capturing poems and prose. I am highly surprised at what I did receive however. Compared to Emily Dickinson, Wilfred Owen and other such greats, this poetry did not strike me at all.I recognise that it is popular with many but for people who expect poetry to be colourful, captivating, evoking and grasping, what is delivered here are consistently unrecognisable words and phrases (my interpretation - yours may be different), not related to personal experiences that hurt, entertain or allow poetry to be written effectively.Whilst the poet is well recognised and I have no problem with people who are fans of Lawrence, I am not impressed at his inability to make be breathe sharply and say ""Goodness. This poem has affected me in an emotional way"". Sorry about these comments, but it is what I feel."
4,Easy to install,"The filters were surprisingly easy to install. The instructions provided in the package were well written and understandable and I had my new filters in place and operational in a minimal amount of time. Our water is now drinkable again.As for the vendor, we received the order in the amount of time stated (7 - 10 days) and had no billing errors so we're happy on that front as well."
2,Hair pins that shouldnt go in your hair.,"They are a perfect match to the actual pins from the anime. However, they are made with metal bobby pins that have no give at all. Getting them in my hair was hard enough, but getting them out left me with a few less hairs in my scalp. These will be great for my halloween costume, but overall they are cheaply made."
5,Not really a toy but a functional enthusiast hairpiece,I was really supprized at the quality of these things my sister loves them. she just complains about the weight seeing as how they are metal.
5,as pretty as the picture,"i loved the hair pins as soon as i saw them, they are very pretty and i am sure wont break because material is very good but they don't really work for a hair accessory. it falls off everytime. but if you just want it to be a collectible something from the anime than this is it. for hair, not so good :)"
2,Disappointed,"When I got them, I was quite pleased. They were bigger than I expected and absolutely lovely. But the pins can't hold hair. At all. I put them in and they just slide out."
2,Not good for actual use,"I was surprised by the size of these hair pins. They're also pretty. However, they don't hold any hair. The ends are kind of blunt and it's easy to hurt yourself while trying to get them to stay put. I actually used regular bobby pin to hold the hair pin in my hair. That's so ridiculous. If you like Bleach, they're a good collector's item, but the practicality is 0."
5,Just perfect,I worked them August 21st and not just for my uniform but everyday use. They are the same ones I saw in hot topic four years ago even have are made under the series name. My hair is very thin and fine so I did have a problem first but if you open the pins up more it helps :)
4,Weeping Willows,"After hearing Dakota Hill's ""Signal Hill"" I can't help but think about the Red House Painters. The gentle slow moving rhythms. The melodic, tear jerking cord progressions all hint of the same sort of despair Mark Kozelek has conjured up on his solo debut ""RocknRoll Singer"". It's no wonder both releases can be found on San Francisco's Badman Records. Beautiful in scope, somber as a dark, rainy day Dakota Suite have made a fine record here although Red House Painters still hold the torch to light the midnight air."
5,Very nice foundation,"I grabbed one of these when my expensive department store makeup ran out and I forgot to buy another. Glad I did! This has been one of those ""finds"" that you discover once in awhile. I'm not sure that it really makes me look younger, but I like the lightness of the makeup - you don't feel like you're applying clown makeup. The coverage is light but you look very, very natural and just pretty. I really like this and I haven't gone back to my expensive department store makeup in two years! Highly recommend!"
2,Not very durable....,"I used this to cut a kinda thick metal pipe and it's totally obsolete now.. but amazon sent me another, so we'll see how it holds up..."
1,bad reaction to this product,"I bought this product from another company for my husband. He tried taking it several times, but each time he had stomach cramps and felt like he was getting sick. Then he would have diarhea. So after ruling out that something else was causing his problems, we decided it was caused by this product."
3,Book Club pick,My Book Club chose this book and we all liked it. One of our group was an attorney for local Social Services and she had some interesting insights to share with us.The rest of us were shocked by some of the foster child situation descriptions. But we felt that we learned something about a subject very much outside our comfort zones. All of the characters are interesting and there's just enough mystery surrounding them to keep the reader's attention.
1,LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS,IM HAVING TROUBLE TRYING TO DOWN LOAD IT TO MY TABLET KINDLE DEVICE AND I CAN TELL YOU HOW THE BOOK IS RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT.
3,Diappointed,I thought I was ordering the novel and ordered this by mistake. Lots of pictures and poems.Just be careful to read the descripton of the item.
3,"Arrived promptly, but ...",The book was well described except it had a dedication on the facing page that would've made me reconsider buying it.
1,For fans and wannabes only,"This CD is boring and derivative to the point of being cynical.A better alternative would be to listen to either:a) the original artists who influenced this bandorb) someone at least trying to do something new with music.To enjoy this CD you'd have to really want to like this band, either because you liked Dig or because you're attracted to their super-cool reputation.If you're afraid you're missing out on something by not owning BJM's back catalogue don't worry, you're not."
2,WARNING: HARD BOOK!,"I am a huge C.S. Lewis fan. I have read most of his works and I think they are great. This one is, on a scale from 1 to 10 in ease (1 being Dr. Suess and 10 being a Neurologists formal report) about a 9. Much more in depth than his other works I have read. A lot of backround knowledge is required. If you are a beginner I would suggest something easier and more fun to read such as ""The Screwtape Letters"" or ""Out of the Silent Planet"", for intermidiate I would suggest ""The Great Divorce"" or ""The Four Loves"". If you are advanced then go ahead and buy this one, I'll be puzzling over it for the next month."
2,You will learn how not to think.,"Just read Dan Lawler's 2 star review and the subsequent conversation he has with Wessexman. It's better than the book. Lewis basically rips apart a book called ""The Control of Language: A Critical Approach to Reading and Writing"" but changes the name of the book and it's authors as if he didn't want you to read it for yourself and come to your own conclusions. Shame on Lewis."
3,morality,"I did not particularly like this book because it was a very hard reading. The moral lessons it teaches though are lessons that we cannot avoid. Yes, there is morality, but it would be almost impossible for a teacher to teach these lessons these days. Too many lawyers around."
2,A difficult read.,"While the premise of the book is true, I found Lewis' writing style difficult to follow. I cannot recommend it to the average reader. Perhaps it would make a good supplement to a university level philosophy course."
2,"Biased, religious, and logically flawed.","While this is a great piece if you want to step inside a virtue theorist's mind, as an actual philosophical text it is rather poor.While it is obviously religiously biased, it is Lewis' own circular paradoxes that lead to a flawed system of logic that can not support itself."
4,Men without chests,"With this book, C.S. Lewis became a prophet. A great deal of the things that have transpired in education and society in the last 40-50 years were predicted here. I exhort educators as well as all those concerned with the current state of western civilization to read this book and take its lessons to heart."
5,excellent,"Although this is probably the Lewis book most thick with philosophy, and is a bit difficult to read, it is defnitely my favorite. Since reading this book I have been haunted by Lewis's theory that in attemp to control nature we only gain control over our fellow men.Lewis proposes that the philosophy of moral relativism, guised as freedom, is actually an archetype for enslavement for both those controlled, and those controlling. If society is reduced to no values, power becomes the only thing worth attaining. Those in power, unchecked by morals, have the ability and freedom to manipulate the subjects in any way they choose. Lewis is saying that man, in his attempt to make progress, learns to control more and more of nature. However, in his attempt to control nature he only gains control over fellow men. In giving up the Tao and allowing himself to do this, man succumbs to cruel nature which, as is obvious by this pattern, he has no control over at all."
3,what is our nature?,"Lewis provides much food for thought, and I agree that he is prophetic in many ways. However, I object to his continual use of human ""nature"" as synonymous with selfish desires. Human beings have always been social creatures, and our survival depends not just on satisfying individual drives but also working together and caring for each other. This could be why some form of the Golden Rule is found throughout the world's cultures. Whereas Lewis personally ascribes the origin of morality to God, or at least an abstract Tao, in fact kindness, compassion, truthfulness, etc. may have evolved as a keys to our survival.Even ants are hard-working, cooperative, solicitous of their young, protective of their Queen, defensive of the colony, and self-sacrificing. Why do we need to ascribe these characteristics to only spiritual creatures?"
3,Pleasant and informative,Provides people new to breeding a good overall view of the process. It is easy to read and a good reference. This is not the highly technical manual that would turn away the amatuer. At the same time it lacks depth to be a truly serious resource.
5,Excellent exercises pinpoint common challenges,"I highly recommend this book for lawyers at all levels and in all practices. Challenging and yet realistic, the exercises hit such common problems as conciseness, paraellelism, and ambiguity. Some may want to work through the book in a series, while others could target a chapter a week. Anyone who devotes enough time and thought to tackling the exercises--as opposed to just skimming the examples--will see improvement.As a side note, I devoured this book as a law student and young lawyer, and now I work with lawyers all over the world and have written a book of my own called Point Made. I am more convinced than ever that working through exercises and analyzing short examples are the most effective ways to improve writing skills."
1,So disappointed,"I found something strange in most books that talk about style; they all another copy of William Strunk book ""The Elements of Style,"" and the authors try to add one or two chapters without any practical examples. When I am looking for a book about legal style, I need to get benefit from/gain the author's experience in the field not to just read academic crazy things.I am so disappointed with this purchase and I do not recommended at all."
1,Legal Writing in Plain English: A Text With Exercises,"Garner's book helps to answer the many lawyer questions you get asked when trying to write legal documents or multiple-user documents in Plain Talk. Garner's approach reinforces Plain Talk and shows ways around the mountains of ""What if?"" and ""How can we say it without risk?"" issues. Because of its publication date, it lacks the most recent changes in punctuation as found in The Gregg Reference Manual. Also, some courts want things written according to their own ""Red/Green"" book standards. Even with these detractors, the book provides excellent advice, examples, and exercises."
1,where is my product??????????????????,"Due to the fact that my seller has not sent me my copy of this, i can not give a proper review. where is my book???"
5,Why is This Out of Print Still?,"""Gotham Noir,"" one of DC's final ""Elseworlds"" tales from 2001, is a knockout story from Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips. Brubaker's takes on the Batman, Joker, and Dent partially influenced Chris Nolan's ""Dark Knight""--witness Sean Phillips's Joker with his mouth slit on both sides into a smile. Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent battle a corrupt Gotham City government and mob. It's an awesome noir and an iconic look at Batman's supporting cast...so why is it out of print?"
2,Marred by Error,"This book is not without error and at least one of them is significant because it involves a major player, Senator John Tyler Morgan.In the verion I read, the author has Morgan as being from Louisiana. Tyler moved to Alabama from Tennessee as a very young child and was involved in that state's politics for more than 50 years, 30 of them as a Senator. Louisiana never sent anyone named Morgan to the Senate (and only one to the House).The book reads well, but a sloppy error like that makes you want to backtrack a lot of other information."
1,GOOD TITLE BUT MISLEADING,"A key document in this book is shown on page 185; it is a copy of a list of rich New Yorkers who had subscribed to the New Lesseps Company, when it was formed on October 24,1894 and sold their shares at a profit in 1903-1904, when the Company was sold to the US Government. But these shares represent only 4,662 out of a grand total of 650,000, which is less than 0.7%! The reader will decide if this is enough to justify the title of the book: Wall Street was there but for so little!The whole book is like this, based on ""personal"" interpretion of facts by the author to serve his goal.It is nevertheless spectacular for its title. A well thought marketing gimmick."
5,Pleased with purchase.,I spend a couple of nights a month out on business. Looked around quite a bit for a replacement for a bag that was coming apart after many years. This bag is much more sturdy than the one it relaces. Love all the pockets/compartments. Couldn't be happier.
2,"too big, too heavy, poor internal design","bulky, bulgy, hard to pack. it looked like a good idea, but this is really hard to deal with if you frequently travel light. by the way, it's hard to hang, too."
5,Another Great Collection from Kirkman & Scott,"Ever since I started reading the Baby Blues comic strip, ages ago, I have loved it. I truly think these two gentlemen sit under my kitchen window, listening to what goes on in my house and taking notes!You'll laugh out loud when you see your own families' trials and tribulations drawn out in these strips -- and you WILL see yourself! That's the appeal of Baby Blues. Wanda and Daryl are typical American parents with typical American kids, and the typical American problems, joys, and laughter that we all have.I highly recommend all of the books in the Baby Blues series!"
3,Art Hodes Keepin' out of mischief now,"I love Art Hodes, always will (saw him perform live in the nineties when I believe he was about 90), but this CD was a disappointment to me, not the same standout-out quality as ""Up in Volley's Room"".Enjoyed his version of Lil Hardin's ""Struttin with the BBQ"" (Hardin was an early wife of Louie Armstrong)."
3,"Real Clutch fans, anyone? hello?","OK, I own every Clutch CD but this one, just because I havent gotten around to previewing or buying it yet (not to mention lukewarm reception by TRUE Clutch fans) ... I was hoping to find some REAL reviews here by real Clutch fans, but all I see are ""gosh i never heard these guys before but they rock"" WELL Yeah we knew that already..So Im not sure what to think, as these reviews are fairly worthless, unless youve never heard Clutch before. I'll come back and write a real review once I hear this one."
5,"Sex, Beer and Pizza: the only things in life as good as Clutch.","Well, not much to say here. Neil (the bad man with a thousand voices) and company do exactly what the title says: they unleash Pure Rock Fury. Clutch is one of those bands where you can't just listen to two or three tunes off the CD; it demands to be played in its entirety while you and your friends are hopefully partying and freaking out because no band you ever heard in your life jams the way Clutch does. A lot different than the classic Transnational Speedway, but it's still Clutch and every tune is a ten out ten. Don't pass this one up. If you're new to Clutch and want to check one CD out before buying a bunch of them, get Tranational Speedway League first. After that you'll grab every other one: trust me. And don't forget to raise a glass of beer to the live version of Spacegrass on here!Necrosoul."
3,"OK, but a step backwards","Clutch have always been influenced by various styles, from the early noise and metal to the later space rock and funk, all channelled through heavy rock music. On this record, they are wallowing in doom and stoner rock. To be honest, this does not exactly excite me. Don't judge a book by it's cover, they say, but you'll find the general mood of this album on the heavy grey clouds on the front and back pictures. Still, Clutch are delivering quality work, and I like several tracks when I feel pissed enough, but all in all, this release only made me listen to Elephant Riders again. Pure Rock Fury? Motorpsycho's Barracuda is hotter."
3,Clutch makes the best of a poorly mixed disc,"Who is kidding who if you like Clutch then you will probably like this disc. Although you may agree with me as I say ""this disc has some of the worst sound quality and productuion values I have ever heard"". I realize that the band was trying for a vintage heavy guitar sound but most of the fuzz only comes through as static and poping. Neil's vocals are hardly even audible due to the garbaled mixing job and over all poor sound quality. At first I thought something was wrong with my sound system but after extensive adjustments, filtering, and comparing with other discs the conclusion was that this disc just dosn't sound very good. Don't get me wrong I really like clutch but not so much that I will convince myself that this disc is better than it really is."
5,Histerical!,"I loved this book!! It's a short, quick read, and definitely worth your time. I really enjoyed it and I would recommend it to anyone. Very funny and enjoyable to read."
3,Importance of being the correct version,"Though I'm a big fan of Wilde's work, my order specified a certain published version. When I received the book, I was surprised to receive a different version (i.e. different publisher, different cover). In the future, please make sure the orders match the advertised image."
4,Oldie but goodie,This is a subtle comedy at its best. Good to read from the perspective of a young or older person.
3,Strange premise but ok,The book had many wit full sayings and was short but it was memorable. The importance over the name Earnest is quite strange and stupid.Recommended for readers who like plays and Shakespeare.
5,"Funny, Easy to Read,",This was a funny little story. Easy to read from the beginning to the end. From the first page you jump in and you are immersed in the lives of the characters. It's funny.
5,Glorious Story,"Such an amazing play! The dry, Victorian-era humor left me laughing almost every page. I love the coincidences and love-triangles, and the plot line confusion was absolutely brilliant. Completely rife with quotes about life and marriage, I bet I'll be repeating lines for weeks. Absolutely fabulous."
4,Laugh out Loud,"I resisted reading this for the longest time just because the topic didn't excite me. However, after spending a little over an hour reading this, it was actually pretty enjoyable. There were some areas that I openly laughed and got these weird looks from people in the coffee shop. I didn't care, I enjoyed the read and the good laughs. Wilde wrote and edited a nice story."
5,One of my all time favorites,The Importance of Being Earnest is just so damn funny. It was written over a century ago and we can still relate to the story. Here's a great play and they just don't write them like they use to is all I can really say about it. This is a classic all the way through.I can only highly recommend this.
4,Partying and Good times and thoughtless happy endings... satirically?,"This fellow gives new meaning to irreverence and ""farce"".His views on the virtues of having a satirically empty headas written by one appears to be the well written best example?His characterization of the English upper class as both idleand clueless came too close to the truth.Yet he mostly has happy endings and a good laugh for all."
2,"Stellar example of too much hype, too little satisfaction","Mother once told me ""Strawberry shortcake is such a wonderful dessert..."" but when I tried it - it was just strawberries and whipped cream on angle food cake.I felt the same way about Earnest. I'd always heard it was a really wonderful play, but halfway through I still had no idea who was whom and what was going on or what they were going on about. Perhaps I'll try it again, later - but I doubt it."
2,Take your time,Did not read much of this will come back to it when i can spend more time with it. not light read
3,It was free.,"I'm not well versed on the classicals. This was a chance to read something light by Oscar Wilde. As a view into an attitude of frivolity of the very rich of that time, it was enlightening. I guess it made a bigger impression than I thought because I am reminded of scenes in the book by things I see in real life quite often."
4,Classic & Clever,"The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde was witty & clever. It's comment on social classes and ""being proper"" was very interesting and there always seems to be an old over-bearing aunt or mother in these sort of classics to make sure everything is kept that way. I found it an easy, quick read and did so in one sitting. I think everyone should read a classic like this at least once in their lives."
3,I thought that it was pretty funny.,I thought that the book was pretty funny and kind of intelligent the way the words where so often spoken. I think that anyone would love this book.
4,Not too shabby,"I mainly appreciated this version of the play in audio format because of its length. It runs just under 2hrs as compared to one of the other ones that is almost 40 minutes longer. I was having to read the play again (I've read it several times for different theatre classes), and it was a great way to refresh myself with the text and to shine new light on some of the ideas. I enjoyed Lady Bracknell and Jack's performances more than the rest of the company, but overall, I feel it was true to the text of the play itself."
4,The Importance of Being Earnest,"It's a very funny, satiric look at life in England at the turn of the century. The wit and humor is possibly dated. I don't believe a young person today would find it as humorous as I did (as a boy) and still do. I still recommend it as a good ""vacation"" read."
2,Inconsequential Style,"Oscar Wilde is a witty man. The Importance of Being Earnest, Wilde's most well-known work, is dripping with sharp humor and clever epigrams. But let's face it, it's fluff. The ""social satire"" that most reviewers cite to hold this book up as High Art is as pointed as a teaspoon and as sincere as a used-car salesman. Wilde was a libertine dandy who admired the snobbery and elitism of blue-blooded Britons. The Importance of Being Earnest is, in many ways, like MTV--stylish and entertaining, with some pretensions, but ultimately just a vacuous time-killer. If you need to read it for class, or even better want some literary [bathroom] reading, fine. If not, don't waste your time."
5,An Earnest Classic,"A quick and entertaining read, Oscar Wilde's comic portrayal of 19th century upper-class intrigue is filled with witty, bantering dialogue. Two friends, Algernon and Jack, perfect the art of ""Bunburying,"" which consists of inventing ill or troublemaking friends and relatives in order to get out of social engagements. Of course, this can only backfire and lead to confusion, particularly as Jack's fictitious brother Ernest shows up unexpectedly at the home of Cecily, Jack's ward and the woman Algernon hopes to marry. As Wilde pokes fun at the upper class and the deceptiveness inherent in its elaborate social protocol, the final irony comes when the hapless deceivers find they may have been inadvertently earnest all along."
5,Hysterical!,"I loved this! Generally I detest reading plays for some reason, but I enjoyed every minute of this one. The characters were excellent, and the plotline creative. Actually, the plot alone is amusing. The dialogue (ooooh, the dialogue!) is absolutely hilarious. I laughed out loud many, many times while reading this. I found Lady Bracknell to be one of the more entertaining characters, with her stereotypically lopsided priorities. Algernon and Jack's many angry (well, on Jack's part, at least) exchanges were marvelous (the bit with the muffins is an absolute classic, in my opinion). The satirical side of this was well-done and rather interesting for those interested in such things, but ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" is, overall, a superb read just for the entertainment value of it."
5,amazing play,"Oscar Wilde never fails to intrest me. This is his most acclaimed and recognized work. The plot was everyday and trite, but with meticulous details Wilde was able to overplay the happily ever after concept-of-a-plot. I'd definitely read this again. If I could only pick one play to read by Wilde, this one would be it."
3,Classic,"Wonderful, light, fast read by a great author who I am never bored with reading his works time and time again."
3,Great book but pages were folded,I don't know what happened when they packaged my item but in the middle of the book the corners of 20 pages were all bent! Other than that it is a good book.
3,Stick to the book for English Class....,"As an English teacher, I bought this recording so that my class could hear Wilde's witty repartee at stage-speed (we all know how slow reading in class can go...). I thought the recording was a fair representation of this quite hysterical play, but there were a few weaknesses that made it less valuable than I had hoped. The women mumbled a little at low volumes, which didn't work in my large classroom and old tape player. Also, the guys didn't like Algernon's voice, which sounded like a woman's and not at all like the rogue we pictured him to be. It was also necessary to keep the text out to read along, unless you've read it before, because the quick English clip of the actors masks some of the funnier lines.Over all, I would recommend this for Wilde lovers who are already familiar with the play and looking for an amusing car-stereo companion."
3,Audio CD is abridged on one CD,"I have not listened to this audio CD version. I purchased it and returned it without listening to it. I opened the case and realized that this is an abridged radio play version on one CD. The play itself is delightful. I don't care for abridged versions of most material, certainly not a play that takes less than 90 minutes in its entirety. I urge Amazon to update the catalog entry to indicate that this is abridged. An unabridged version is available from other vendors. Thank-you."
2,Oscar doesn't age well.,"While Earnest might have been delightful 100 years ago, it becomes a chore to finish these days. All the synonyms for trite and stuffy apply. I was taken back to high school Literature days, when some of the assigned classics felt like punishment. Sorry Oscar, this one isn't timeless."
5,Farce for the ages,"I listened to an audio performance of this hilarious farce. Even over a hundred years after its original publication, this tale of mistaken identities and silly social interactions continues to entertain.Jack Worthing and his irreponsible friend, Algernon, both pretend to be named Earnest as they pursue love with Gwendolen Fairfax and Cecily Cardew.When the four lovers visit Jack's country home at the same time, the proverbial s**t his the fan. But never fear, a convienient twist resolves matters to everyone's satisfaction."
5,Brilliantly Funny,"This book has remained one of my favorites since reading it in high school ~5 years ago. I have re-read it multiple times, seen it live & as a movie, and never seem to tire of Wilde's excellent knack for satire.It is a quick & fun read full of irony and hilariously awkward situations. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys play-format comedies with strong irony."
5,Timeless!,The Importance of Being Earnest has always been one of my favorite books ever! I read it out in no time again after downloading the Kindle edition which I found well presented. I thoroughly advise anyone to get it.
4,"Quick, Clever, and Amusing","I am not a very big fan of plays, but I picked this up while in Dublin and couldn't put it down. It is very amusing and can easily be read in one sitting. The story is quite clever: through hilarious twists and turns two socialites somehow become engaged to the same man. And the kicker is, he doesn't even exist!"
4,Funny and sarcastic,"I found myself in the break room at work, as I was reading ""Ernest"", laughing out loud. I love the sarcastic wit of O. Wilde."
1,contains too much hype!,"contained too many unrealistic income expectations for person to attain. Also, no such thing as an independent contractor status instead of ""employee"" status according to Internal Revenue Service definition for pet sitters, could result in fines and penalities to owner! Where's the true facts instead of selling her products!"
5,Wonderful for anyone thinking about this profession!,"I am thinking of starting up my own pet sitting business in the near future and this book answered all of my questions and more. Patti Moran provides an abundance of great information and points out things I've never even thought of. The only downside of this book is that it is a bit out of date, but not so much so that you wouldn't be able to relate to it. It is a great tool to have before starting up. I am very pleased with this book and will more than likely buy the next version should one be written.Shame on all of you who are putting down Patti Moran for mentioning her products in this text! She only mentions her products a couple of times throughout the book and I find these mentionings to be quite appropriate and helpful.I urge anyone thinking of starting up this type of business to purchase this book."
5,Great book,"If your looking for great advice on all aspects of the pet sitting biz, this is the book to buy!"
1,Pet Sitting for Profit,The content of this book was not very helpful. I don't see how anyone can possibly make a livable profit from this business. It just doesn't add up and the book was a waste of money.
3,"Good, but general information","I bought this book with high expectations, since Patti is billed as the ""guru"" of pet sitting. The information provided in the book is extensive, but it seems to me that the book is actually an advertisement for the products Patti Moran sells on her website. I thought for the price of the book, we should expect at least one business form to start our business! If you want to buy those, the catalog is free! Overall, the book helps you decide if pet sitting is really for you, and how to go about setting up the business (insurance, bonding, office practices, etc). If that's all you expect from this book, you won't be disappointed."
2,too much like a business textbook,"I felt that Patti Moran spent too much time talking about personnel issues rather than the day to day issues of a sole proprieter business. You could find most of the information contained in her book in any generic business text. I would have liked to hear more of the personal experiences of pet sitters, the best and worst parts of their jobs, what to expect, etc."
5,Best Synonym book ever.,I bought this book a couple months ago and it hasn't left my desk since. Highly recommend.
5,Necessary,"I've worn out one copy, and have one at work and one at home today. I write a lot (though, of course, not as much as Joel Brinkley who also gives 5 stars), and the Rodale book is the greatest help I know for finding the exact word to express a thought, a feeling, and an opinion. I don't know how a serious writer can function without it. Well, I suppose they could have memorized an unabridged dictionary.Would that I could get it on CD so it could be a plug-in for WordPerfect and MS-Word instead of the clumsy ""thesauruses"" those programs provide."
2,Poor Binding,"I was unaware of how poor the binding is until it was delivered.Regardless of how careful one is in handling, the binding will not last long.I now see that there is a hard copy edition available.I have returned the paper copy and may order the hard copy/"
4,Why not on CD?,"No doubt great but in this day and age, should be on searcheable CD format. Why publisher does not so provide doesn't make sense--would really be perfect then."
5,Buy it!!!,Don't waste your time or money on other competitive products. This is THE best. I've loved this book for about 20 years. I gave my first copy away to someone that loved it so much that he kept borrowing mine :) Highly recommeded!!!
5,THE BEST,"This is the best thesaurus ever. I have found this book very helpful, this book should be in every house."
4,Seems good so far,Wow! What a book. The only reason it isn't 5 star is because I didn't realize that it was going to be so big and heavy! I originally wanted this book to be able to go in my purse but that's completely out of the question now. I should have realized it'd be so thick. It has quite a lot of material.
4,Worth the purchase!,I was introduced to this book by a college professor. She allowed me to borrow this book and I was amazed with the amount of words contained in this book.This book is extremely usuful if you are interested in increasing your vocabulary and/or you do a lot of writing.I'm using it to help prepare for the verbal portion of the GRE exam.
4,The Synonymn Finder,"I found the book useful, as it covers quite an extensive area of words. I particularly liked the addition of grammatical detail for some of the entries. However, I would have appreciated perhaps a similar style of presentation as for a Harrap's Thesaurus, with the inclusion of antonymns. Generally, I felt the book was a good buy, as it offered an alternative to my use of some other similar kinds of books, as this would mean that I would have within reach, a number of books to check up words and expressions."
5,Excellent,We were very happy doing business with this dealer. The book arrived in a timely manner and is in perfect condition.
4,Positive,"Other than being a little old, book received was in really good condition. Was delivered faster than I expected which was a nice surprise. Content is somewhat helpful, provides a lot of different synonyms that I may not have thought of. However, flipping through all the pages (1300+) takes time. I prefer the ease of searching on the internet. But I do use the book occasionally, just not as much as I had hoped when purchasing."
2,Not for Me,While I love the concept of this product I found it difficult to apply and did not like how it felt on my skin. I prefer lotion sunscreens.
5,Excelent,This CD .The Hollies were in their top form. Live and sounding better than ever. The tunes had sort of a slight disco touch to some of them.I've heard alot of groups through the years. They are a solid good clean group that stands up to time. From the 60's to present. They've produced alot of great songs.Every so often i here a new and different song that i havent ever heard before. Hoping to hear more comming from the hollies in the future. These guys bring back great memories from the 60's and 70's . Great stuff. A great addition to anyones libuary.
4,hollies live in 83,"This is basically the archives alive cd with several other songs on it.I personally like the live hollies sound from earlier recordings like the one they did in the 1970's because this is more toned down guitar wise. However this is still a very good live show from a 2009 Rock and Roll Hall of fame inductee, that laid it all down in harmonic goodness. I have all their studio recordings and they were all great to very good at least. The hollies sing dylan was my least fave , but most of their output is just very well done , from early british invasion to power pop and rock they were a great band to listen to on many levels. This one is the band in the 1980's still sounding and playing great. It has many hits on it and is alot of fun to listen to. This one is very clear and pleasant to listen to. The best music is made by real musicians who play live on thier concerts and you get that with this release."
4,Excellent Buy,THE PRODUCT MET MY NEEDS AND IS QUALITY MEETS ALL COMPARISON OR SIMILAR ITEMS. EASY TO CARRY AND CAN ANYWHERE.
4,Victorian Writers having fun!,"This is one of Dickens' first compilations of Christmas stories. At this point, he wasn't using a definite framing device (snowbound hotel guests, shipwreck survivors, etc.), just a group of people sitting around a fire. This collection contains the classic ghost tale ""The Old Nurse's Story"" by Elizabeth Gaskell."
5,great CD,"This CD is great, my son Noah and I listen to it in the car and although he is only 12 months he gets excited when I turn it on.Andrea"
3,A slower Fletch installment,The bar has been set so high by the popular Fletch and Fletch Lives that this installment does struggle to quite get up there. Fletch is in the States to chase after paintings presumably stolen from his fiancée's family. His first encounter upon arrival is that of a dead body in the apartment he is renting. Things move slowly and unevenly but he solves both the case of the stolen paintings and of the dead girl.
4,Fletch Fun in this Book,"Yes, that Fletch, the same character from the 1985 movie with Chevy Chase. After I saw that movie in high school, I read a few of the books on which it was based. Gregory Mcdonald has nine books with Irwin Maurice Fletcher as an investigative reporter sleuthing, disguising, and lying his way through the mystery. The two Fletch movies portray him as more goofy than he is in the novels, but the books are good reads before bedtime.Confess, Fletch is the second in the series, and has Fletch fly in to Boston to find a murdered woman in his rented house. While trying to solve that murder, he is also trying to track down stolen paintings from a family heirloom from a possibly crooked art dealer.Mcdonald's writing style is breezy and quick, with lots of dialogue to move the story along. If you are interested in mystery novels, this could be for you. I'm not a mystery reader usually. I just like spending time with arrogant smart-alecks."
4,A Fun Read,"Confess, Fletch is a good time. It feels much more like a Fletch read, along with the introduction of Inspector Flynn. It's a well-crafted whodunit and Macdonald's writing still seems edgy and fun."
1,Disappointingly dry reading,"The reader just reads the sonnets mechanically, he doesn't act them out or give any interpretation, there's no performance, he sounds like a smart kid reading the sonnets to get a grade. Pass on this one and go for ""Midsummer Night's Dream"" also on Naxos which is really good."
5,Incredible!,"I thought that this was an incredible book! It left you wondering.... whatever will happen between Tristan and Zoey? And, what about Summer? I guess you'll have to read it and see what I'm talking about."
2,HUBBARD AND GROUP GREAT; RECORDING VERY POOR,"This is a companion album to Vol. 1, Keystone Bop Sunday. Both cut at the same time. Hubbard at his usual post BlueNote best as are the other players. The main negative with this and the companion album is the very poor recording quatity. Both were recorded using the house PA system--not the best for recording players of this quality. I do not think the effort was originally intended for release. If you are a die-hard Hubbard fan like me, then go ahead and get both albums. Just do not expect much in the way of sonics.Whoever was recording with the house PA system just let the tape run between tunes. This is one of the novel features that can make a live session really come off as the banter between players and the sounds of the audience lend a feeling of being there at the club. Unfortunately, the very poor recording quality renders this between-tune chatter inaudible. A shame."
2,BEWARE OF SIZE,I bought this clock to put on our mantel however it is much too small for that purpose.The face cover is plastic and is loose on the clockPretty cheap construction for $80
5,the best for a bigger kid!!!,"When my daughter turned 3 we wanted a ore comfy stroller for her to ride in, especially for days at Disney etc. I debated over this one and the BOB. Went with this one because it could seat a taller child better. this is the best stroller I have used in terms of kid comfort and easiest to push. I am not sure it would be as great for a younger kid because of no snack tray and a baby might 'swim ' in the big seat but for older kids it is the best. I couldnt be happier!!! Storage and drink holders are great too, and I have never has trouble with the brakes!"
2,dont bother with this book,"i bought this book because it was cheap and I needed information before bought my python to see if it was the species for me. This book tells you to do things every experienced reptile keeper has told me not to. I have had my ball python for three years and this book has never come in handy, dont bother with it, get yourself a real handbook. Its really just a skimpy overview of anything to do with bp's."
2,Too general,"Some helpful basic information, but overall, too general. No specifics on temperatures, humidity, what to feed at what age/size, what size/age to start breeding, etc."
4,"""Hand me the rhinoceros fan. It's broken? Then hand me the rhinoceros!""","HAND ME THE RHINOCEROS is a brilliant little book on Koan practice in Zen. Koans are little riddles (""What is the sound of one hand clapping?"") the contemplation of which can cause an enlightenment experience.Tarrant illustrates a number of Koans with a series of chatty personal tales. There's nothing of the esoteric in Tarrant's writing. These obscure epigrams are attacked in a straight-ahead manner that both illuminates the nature of Koan study and (less importantly) provides some guidance to the answer.Whether the reader is an experienced Zen student used to working with Koans or the rankest newcomer to the cushion doesn't matter. BRING ME THE RHINOCEROS will bring you to a clearer understanding of the Great Matter."
5,Bring Me the Rhinocerps,"John Tarrant is a superb writer and poet. I've read this book at least 4 times and always find something new and delightful. l have also sent this book to 3 other people, and they loved it, too. It contains much ancient wisdom."
2,Starrett 734,It would be nice if I would have actually received a Starrett 734 mic as the description states. Instead I received a Starrett 3734 which is a cheaper copy of what I was supposed to get. I am very unhappy with the product I received.
2,Dissapointed with result,"My hair stylist recommends not shampooing my hair every day to keep my red hair red longer after a dye job. However, since my hair is quite fine it looks greasy if I don't shampoo. I have tried baby powder in the past but it ends up looking white and going everywhere. I bought this product in the hopes that it would prevent greasy roots and allow me to shampoo every other day. I was dissapointed because it didn't have the effect I wanted. My hair still looked greasy and dull and the only difference was that it was bright red at the roots from the spray."
2,Manufactured poorly but maybe that's just mine...,"I recently got one of these. I am an artist who specializes in stippling. This was among the cheapest rapidographs I have ever purchased. The thing leaks ink, the box was broken new and the nib is bent. I contacted the seller, who directed me to the manufacturer. I would have to pay to ship it back myself; I think I'll just buy a better pen (it's really not worth my time to drive to the post office, package it, possibly insure it, buy stamps for it, and wait a month for another one.) Anyway, it looks really pretty in the picture."
2,Return policy,"Careful! The item itself is made well. When opening the box I like it immediately but once out of box I noticed the weight. Bit heavy & of course with the CD's it's heavier. Some people might not think so but with a neurological disorder, MS, weakness increases.I read their return policy & couldn't believe it. ALL sales final UNLESS you get a ""code"" from the company giving permission to return an item. This is NOT anywhere on the description, if it was I would not have ordered it.I e-mailed the company twice & still have not received a reply, not even saying that they would not give a credit. Not very professional!"
5,A very touching and emotional book about a serious problem.,I feel that this person has written from the heart about her experiences and struggle to overcome a serious problem in our country. I think that it took a lot to express her feelings to possibly help others.
1,It was too short.,"It's a great book, I just hated that it ended so quickly. I could have kept on reading, the thoughts and ideas are encouraging and inspiring. Good read!"
3,Text Book,"Its a ok book it is kinda boring at parts, I had to buy it for class which is why I have it. but It is a good book for class purposes"
4,It's good once you get past chapter 1,"When I read chapter one, I thought I was reading a foreign language. I decided to read the summaries first at the end of each chapter. This made reading much much easier and the topic friendlier."
4,Good Beginer's guide,The book is well written and researched but is very preliminary and recommended for beginers. Its a great starter book to those who are not familiar but are interested in the law from a sociological perspective. The author writes well and has thorough research and provides references for further information but can be somewhat repetitive.
2,Good For a while and then the screen starts to go!,"It started out good, but now there are big blue blotches on the screen. I've had this TV for almost three years and about a year and a half in, it started to get these blue blotches. I called Sony and they had someone call to see if it was one of their common problems, then said it wasn't and that we would have to pay $100 just to have a guy come out and check to make sure and then pay for repairs on our own afterwards if it wasn't a problem that they were already aware of. My in laws and sister also bought the same TV and they are both having the same problems....If you buy this TV get the extended Warranty!"
1,SONY DOES NOT STAND BY ITS PRODUCT,"My Sony Vega 60 inch operated for only ten months when the screen went black. It appears to be the lamp b/c the lamp light is blinking. Sony has said it is NOT going to honor the warranty, even though the tv operated for only ten months, b/c the warranty takes effect from the date of purchase, not the date of install. I called 3 days out of the warranty. So even though I can prove the tv was still in the box at the store, I have to pay myself this expense. No TV that costs this much should operate only ten months. SONY YOU SUCK."
1,Don't believe the hype.,"Nothing more than hyped up silicone in a bottle, this product is so full of silicones it would prevent any of it's ""anti aging"" ingredients from penetrating at all, their ""study"" to prove this stuff ""really works"" was funded by, none other than guess who? Boots! one of the many silicones listed in this is known to build up for months and can be dangerous, this is example of how advertising can really fool people."
4,Boots Restore and Renew,"Being a licensed hairdresser for many years, skin care is extremely important to me. Although I was blessed with good skin time does take an effect. I have spent hundreds of dollars on the best skin creams and seriums on the market with the leading physicians, product being my line. Anyway. after trying Boots No7 Restore and Renew, I find it does just what it says it will. My skin feels so soft with the deepness of wrinkles decreasing. There is no magic potion beyond surgery or injection however this is one of the very best skin care lines on the market and price makes it even that much more valuable. I am sold and will continue...THANKS"
4,Really see a difference,"I have been using No7 Serum and moisturizers for 2 months now and I can see a difference in my skin. I am in my 70's and have tried other skin care that promise results, but Boots works."
1,No effect,"I had high hopes but unfortunately, the product did nothing for me. My bottle lasted about a month although I used it sparingly. The pump stopped working when the product ran low. Trying to get to the remaining product by removing the cap didn't work either. It was just too thick and the opening in the bottle was too small.There are products costing the same or less which last longer and perform considerably better. Any lotion or cream containing Alpha Hydroxy acid (or other alpha or beta acids) in a 10% to 12% concentration and a pH of around 3.0-4.0 will give your skin noticeable improvements in a matter of weeks. These products have been around for years and they continue to improve upon them. They can be purchased at just about any department or drug store and they last for months. I'm going back to my trusted Neoteric Alpha Hydrox."
2,Nothing special,Moisturized my face but I didn't notice anything extraordinary with my skin once the bottle was empty. Not sure what the fuss is about.
4,Boots # 7 Beauty Serum,Love it. I've been using this serum for 1 month now and the biggest difference is a improved feel in my skins texture. Much smoother. I'll keep using it for sure.
2,Had to stop using it,"I started using Boots No. 7 and within a week developed sensitive lips and tongue numbness. My lips felt as if they had been burnt. I had to constantly apply lip balm and vaseline to help with the discomfort. It was almost two months after I started using the serum that I realized it was causing my lip sensitivity. Even though I liked the smoothness the serum gave my skin, I immediately stopped using it. Within two weeks, my lips were back to normal. I don't know what ingredient in the serum caused my sensitivity, but be aware if you start using it."
2,I believed the hype,"I have been using the cream for about 3 weeks now and to be honest, I don't notice any difference. I will keep using it and report back if I notice any improvement wrinkle-wise then"
3,Restore & Renew Beauty Serum,After 30 days of use I'm seeing subtle improvement in facial lines--the product feels great going on and I will continue to use it.
1,The product caused an allergic reaction,"I'm sitting here with a red, blotchy rash on my face that's very uncomfortable. I've also got huge, puffy bags under my eyes. All of this happened within a couple of days of me starting to use Boots No. 7 Protect & Perfect beauty serum. Apparently, I'm allergic to something in this product. My face is bumpy and discolored, and it hurts. The package says the product is hypoallergenic, but be aware that it can cause an allergic reaction. Believe me, this product has done nothing to increase my beauty - in fact, I'm embarrassed to leave the house. This was my first Boots purchase, and it will definitely be the last."
1,Major breakout!,"I broke out in a big way within 3 days of the trying the Day Cream. I have never broken out from any other skin product, don't have a skin problem, and did not use any thing else that was different. Boots No 7 is the ony explanation. Caution!!"
4,No 7 Protect & Perfect,"So far i like it but i dont see any miricles. It does makes my skin feel really nice, but i think i have to use it longer to see the true effect."
1,Awful Product,"Do not waste your money. I ordered 4 Boots No7 products, returned them all. Broke out my face, product was expired (that's what the bad smell is). I would never order any of these products again."
1,Boots will not stand behind product:,"Asked Boots for a refund on their poor quality MASCARA and this was their reply:""Thank you for contacting Boots.Boots does not offer refunds for general dissatisfaction and apologize for this inconvenience. Everyone has different skin types and will have varying levels of skin change.Sincerely,Boots Customer Service"""
5,No7 Beauty Serum,Saw this product on the Dr Oz show tried it and just love the way it makes my face feel.
3,Disappointing,"I've used the previous version, The Pocket Holt Handbook,in the past and loved it because it was slim, visual,colorful, and easy to use.All the things I liked about the Holt are missing here.It's thicker and more bloated. It's more expensive --as usual for these things. And it's harder to findthings. All the color markers are gone. The brightnessis gone. It looks exactly like every dull, boring,grammar handbook out there.I guess I have no choice but to order it for mystudents -- the alternatives are monsters thatweigh a ton and cost a fortune. However, I'llcontinue to use my little Holt -- and encouragemy students to look for used copies if they can."
4,Better than the last few Paddington books,"The seventh Paddington book includes the following stories: A Bear at Sea, Anchors Away, Paddington Buys a Share, A Visit to the Stock Exchange, Paddington in a Hole, Too Much off the Top and Paddington Steps Out. My favorite of these are Paddington Buys a Share, A Visit to the Stock Exchange and Anchors Away. In this adventure Paddington comes back to England from his visit to Peru with his Aunt Lucy. While back in England he gets a job at a barber shop, buys a stock and goes to Judy's school and ends up performing in a ballet. It's your average Paddington book but I felt like it was better than the last few have been."
3,A decent buy for pickle lovers,"This books provides some good pickling recipes with introductions describing the history of that particular pickle, or where the recipe was obtained. It is a cute and often nostalgic book that would be a good addition to the bookshelf of any pickle lover. However, if you are looking for a comprehensive guide to pickling then you should look elsewhere. This could be considered akin to a small cookbook with some varied basic recipes, many of which are easy enough to do without much prior experience, but it lacks going into any depth into the pickling process and first time picklers and canners may be more comfortable starting out with a more thorough book such asThe Joy of Pickling, Revised Edition: 250 Flavor-Packed Recipes for Vegetables and More from Garden or Market."
1,Definitely not preserving traditions,I was aggravated I even paid for this book. It has very little to do with actual pickling and fermentation. Most of the recipes are simple modern day pour vinegar over your food type of pickles rather than actual lactic acid fermentation. Traditional recipes involved fermentation and had the added benefit of probiotic content. This book modernizes a lot of recipes and destroys that added benefit. The sauerkraut recipe even says to only let it sit for one day. That wouldn't even begin to be long enough for making sauerkraut. I showed this book to my grandma and she was very disappointed as was I. The traditions have definitely been lost with this book.
4,Delicious canned mussels from Spain,They are really good. It seems as if they improve in the can. I really prefer this canned mussels than the fresh ones.
3,Its ok when you're hungry,I bought these after watching the Anthony Bourdain episode where he goes to spain and eats super expensive canned seafood. These are probably not the same ones from the show but its better than nothing. These are a bit too oily for my taste with a metallic tangy aftertaste. They could be pretty good with some wine or some type of alcohol but then again everything is better with alcohol. If you don't mind the metallic aftertaste then I would recommend this.
2,received by mistake! Ordered octopus!,"I ordered Octopus and received this by mistake, I decided to try them since i like mussels. I had only had them fresh prior to this!I found them to be very hard to open and they were VERY salty to my taste!I gave them to one of my daughters and she agreed that they were too salty and the can was very hard to open !I Would not buy them again, After looking at the nutrition facts they have 250mg sodium 25mg of cholesterol and 1 gram saturated fat!I will get fresh ones when I want clams again!"
4,The Queen of Death from John Milne,"I think the book is especially for young but not advanced readers. Simple vocabulary and sentences are used to relate the story. Despite that, the mistery might interest grown-ups as well. I really enjoyed reading it because the book presents some surprising twists and it has got an exciting plot."
3,"Good to read, but problematic","The basic premise of the ""Be blessed and pass those blessings to others"" is good, and very insightful, but that only goes for about 5 chapters, and then he changes the whole premise for the book to ""missionaries are only those who go to unreached people groups"", which is a common theology of missions today. It seemed like he wanted to use the first to prove the latter, and that seemed like a stretch. I wished he would have kept to the original subject, as he could have gone a lot deeper into it. Still, the first half of the book is really good, worthwhile reading.(It's a required text for mission majors at Liberty University, and everyone gets it online because the book supplier for the school is awful, so that's why Lynchburg is #1 for buying this book... :)"
5,Who does not love the sea,This album will certainly make you want to love the sea. I was looking for some old songs from my youth and I found them here. Other titles like 'Ein Schiff wird kommen' and 'Santo Domingo' came back to me when I listened to this 'sea-worthy' album.
5,"Everything the title says, the DVD is!","Well, Im not going to list all the matches cuz you got lists of people jotting them down... But this DVD is well worth the money and all they matches on this Card is great... He is the Game and that Damn Good!"
4,The Lords return,"Being woefully dissapointed by their previous album, Our Little Secret, I orignally listened to Farstucker with more than a little reluctance. I was almost instantly surprised to hear tracks that would have been right at home on Lust or Voodoo-U, if not for the clearly more mature and evolved feel to the tracks. Listening to Farstucker I can forgive the money I wasted on Our Little Secret. A few of the tracks are ""fillers"" - simply providing ambience for the next song, but the disc has plenty of full length songs to please your stereo and annoy your neighbors through the night. I would recommend this disc to fans of oldschool LoA, Praga Khan, Astral Projection, or Apollo 440."
4,Best LOA yet...,"I have almost all of the Lords of Acid CD's. For the most part they are all great late night coding music for me. Usually an album has 2 or 3 really great tracks, and the rest tend to range from good to just ok.This CD contains many awesome tracks, some that you will want to play so loud your ears bleed. All of the tracks seem very well polished and professional (gasp!). A few have some repetitive bits in them.All of the LOA albums are pretty edgy, but this one seems a little tamer than the norm. Perhaps with a few tracks that could even play on the radio. Now, don't get me wrong... even a tame LOA CD is MUCH MUCH more graphic and vulgar than any other CD you are likely to purchase. They are definitely out there, so be aware.So... if you are an LOA fan, buy it, you won't be disappointed. If you are hard core techno fan looking for something edgy, buy it. If you are easily offended or you are under age 18, buy something else."
4,Fly mix of phat beats,"this cd is just friggin awesome. it just makes you dance. ""I like it"" is one of the greatest songs they have ever made. probably number two next to ""pussy"" this cd is great and if you don't buy it you will be hunted down."
1,Disappointing!!,"This album is a huge letdown from start to finish. Monotonous and uninspired. I always expected the Lords to keep getting better with every album, but this album is just louder. Bring back the keyboards!!"
1,Never got it,"Bad service, never even got my book. Paid $20 on it and they gave me $10 back and replied to my complaints with automated emails. Not helpful."
4,American Indian Politics .. what a history lesson!,"As a descendant of the Lumbee Indians of North Carolina, David Wilkins is the perfect person to write this very informative book. If you are interested in the history of the native American peoples, I recommend that this book is in your reading list."
1,wing nut,"Spectre 4780 Muscle Car Air CleanerBe careful,don't count on getting the ""deluxe wing nut"" as stated. I ordered six(6) of these and only one(1) had a wing nut with it. I checked at my local auto stores(AutoZone,Kragen,Etc)and they ALL had wing nuts with them!!!!"
1,"A confusing, poorly written book",A very poorly written book. Many grammatical errors. Tries to justify the Jews as the cause of all problems. No coherent theme. Does not make the difficult Middle East situation any clearer. I'm glad I didn't spend the money to buy the book.
1,Don't waste your time with this one,"While the subject matter is highly interesting, the presentation does not justify the waste of paper. This reads like a high school term paper with many grammer errors, punctuation errors, misquotes of references, references from unreliable sources, and quotes used out of context. The author shows a deep inner hatred of the United States and a deep hatred of Jews. It's too bad this subject couldn't have been addressed in a more objective writing."
2,Better atlases are available,Something of an outdated dinosaur. Pictures are consistently less clear than Netter's anatomy atlas. Look at it before you buy to make sure you find the pictures acceptable.
1,wrong,i got sent a electric charcoal starter and not a knife. i sent it back and have heard anything since.
4,"Good Movie, but DO'NT buy DVD ""Madacy"" copy!!!","The movie itself is good. But the ""Madacy"" Company copied a lousy, badly worn, faded, repaired 16mm copy on to the DVD and is miserable to watch! The film must have been shown 100's of times. It is so badly spliced, in some scenes you can't even understand the dialog! The whole last half of the movie, the sound is extremely garbled! Very poor visual quality. You would expect a DVD to be higher in quality - not this one. Record the movie off of TV!"
3,VINTAGE SWANSON CURIO.,"In this early talkie from 1931 - in which everyone does their best in an essentially mediocre film - a 32 year-old Gloria Swanson plays a lady with a past. Gloria, who is involved with a writer (Ben Lyon) discovers that Lyon's sister has her old flame as her new fiancee... With good reason, Swanson had misgivings about this film which is weak both plot-wise and musically: her fears unfortunately proved right. Leo McCarey, the director, was promised his ""big break"" with this film and Ben Lyon was - rather unbelievably - considered a major coup for a leading man, therefore, Swanson agreed to do it for United Artists. Perhaps the most capable performer is Arthur ""Dagwood"" Lake as Buster Collins. Swanson had just priorly turned down Paramount's offer of a guaranteed 1 million-dollar-a-year contract (!)."
2,You think it doesn't matter but....,"Not too much to say about a product like this, but I tried this brand and found them hard to apply and inferior quality. I threw them out and bought the (mroe expensive) Palm brand ""Anti-Glare screen protectors"" and am elated. It was easy to apply and you can clear the fingerprints off of them. The Palm ones were more expensive but a much better product - I've had the same one on my Treo for 7 months now and don't see why I'd ever need to replace it."
2,Sufficient Protection But ...,"Palm Treo 700p ClearTouch Anti-Glare Screen ProtectorThis product cannot support some of its selling points. Based on my experience over the past 6 months, I replaced it once on my Treo 700p because it did not fulfill the following claims: Dust-repelling, Fingerprint Free, Improves Handwriting Recognition. And the sensitivity of the touchscreen was inhibited by the screen. It does protect the Treo touchscreen from scratches and is completely washable and reusable. But application even with the supplied applicator does not easily flatten out the air bubbles when applying to the Treo. The screen is a dust magnet and natural oils from your fingers cannot easily be wiped off. So, once applied, the dust and fingerprints are visible to the naked eye. I expect much improvement over the next year if I am to purchase this again. Hence, I only give two out of 5 stars to the Boxwave anti-glare screen protector."
5,ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!,"I stand by my title, it was ABSOLUTELY AWESOME! I loved every minute of it--and Reiji-sama too! I love crazy chicks! lol"
4,Great toy for older babies,"I really wanted to buy my son a set of wooden blocks. We had some other Haba wooden toys/rattles so I thought these might be just as good. They are a great toy for wooden blocks. My son is 9 months old and he'll throw them, wave them around, and knock them over if I stack them up. However, entertainment value is limited because of his age. I think they'll be better for him when he's about a year or so and can do more with them.As for the other reviewer who was upset that the blocks split when left soaking in water, the directions that come with them specifies only a damp cloth for cleaning and to specifically NOT soak them. They are wood after all."
5,Beautifully bright durable blocks,"Great to find safe non toxic blocks with such bright beautiful colors. These are nicely made, quality looking blocks. Highly recommend them"
4,Excellent first blocks and great fun for years to come,"These are great, durable, colorful blocks for infants learning to grasp. They're also excellent for putting in and taking out of containers, building, etc. Both my infant daughter and 3 year old son enjoy these blocks."
3,"Runny dye, not as durable as expected...",Unfortunately dye is fading and wood pieces are splintering due to recent light wash of blocks...
4,Baby's First Blocks,"These blocks fit their title and are appropriate for first blocks. They are small enough for my 9 month old to grip easily, and he is attracted to the colors. The colors also seem pretty chip resistant. These blocks get thrown around quite a bit and none of the color has come off."
2,BE CAREFUL!,"We purchased these based on the great reviews, and when they arrived they seemed to be everything people said they were. Loved the colors and the quality looked great. Our daughter also seemed to like them. However, two days after receiving them I went to clean our toys, and noticed that one of the blocks had developed a surface splinter! I'll try and attach a picture as it's hard to describe otherwise.She only played with them a couple of times, and both times were under supervision, so it's not like she was throwing them around or chewing on them that caused the piece to do this. We have since returned the blocks, and are debating whether or not to get another set. Probably not as there are so many other toys out there, but it's unfortunate.Anyways -- parents please be careful and check all of the pieces periodically! I shudder to think what would have happened had we not noticed this. (Our daughter is still at that age when she will put things in her mouth)"
2,Great but fatally flawed software,"The functionality of this software is excellent. It is easy to use but also sound in its project management logic. It is possible to see your project represented as a PERT chart and as a Gantt chart, as well as seeing all key parameters: staffing, utilization, budget and so on. The software performs good analytical calculations, including PERT time estimates. It is very, very well designed and a dream to use.There is, however, a fatal catch. The software is simply not reliable in terms of availability. I have been using this software for several years, and so far (March 2009) there have been times when the software simply refuses to load or the licensing protection prevents the software from loading, i.e. the licensing protection claims that I have no license when in fact I do. This means it is very risky to manage a project on this otherwise great software because it is likely that when you need it you will be unable to use it. A pity."
4,Overall good transformer,Pros: ability to widen wheelbase and lower body for speedier pursuits (something I wouldn't mind seeing on a real-life vehicle)Pros or Cons: simple transformation; color scheme is not tough and rugged like Dirt Boss's personality; light weaponryCons: my vehicle's wheels have some trouble spinning
1,Poor quality/workmanship,"WEBCam kept on freezing and needed to reboot often.It does no have a built in microphone, so one need to get a seperate mike."
5,"This is by the ""Passion"" guy","KJ is of the group K5 who had the awesome hit ""Passion"" (the song with the moans) a few years ago. This CD is packed with club hits such as Sharaz's ""Just Can't Wait"" & ""Lift Me Up(My Body Up)"", Robin Fox's huge ""I See Stars"", Xirtam or Matrix's ""Red Pill""(the rabbit hole song), and ""Precious Little Fantasy 2000"" by Precious(who is a member of K5). These songs alone are worth getting your hands on this CD. The rest of the songs are solid breakbeat/dance trax that will not disappoint. This is not a trance disc like the other reviewer thought, and found out differently. Just look at the beginning two words of the title...they say it all. If you can find them, you may want to check-out KJ's Vol.1 & 2 of this, and K5's single of ""Passion"" which is sweeet! (Note:If I ever find them on here I will post my reviews of them.) If you liked my review then don't forget to vote. THANKS!"
3,Awesome for breakdancing!!!1,"Well i'm new to the whole trance and rave scene so I purchased this thinking it was going to be a great trance mix, but its basically a great buy for breakdancers. Overall the mixing from track to track is flawless, but if your a trance fanatic then this cd would not suit you.."
3,Quality suspect,Last one only lasted a year but when it works it sounds good and is the right shape for my needs. Would buy again based on the price.
5,Another treat from 32 Windsor Gardens,"In this third Paddington Bear volume, we discover other adventures involving our good bear and his new family. Whether it is at the river, at an auction or at a restaurant, the comic situations in this volume are a treat for everybody. Of my favorites, the one at the restaurant and the home while Mr. and Mrs Brown are sick remain the most memorable to me. With Peggy Fortnum's ink illustrations, also available on the Kindle, this electronic edition of Paddington Bear is another good read from Michael Bond."
4,Great starting book,"This book takes a quick casual look at certain facets of low limit Hold'em, and sprinkles in some Omaha and Stud for good measure. This $10 book has helped me net over $400 in poker winnings online and in a casino in the last 2 months, never higher than $2/$4 stakes. The starting hand table is absolutely necessary for beginners, and easy to master. Once you see how well it works, you'll be ready for the more advanced texts about tells, betting strategy, etc. A must-read for anyone who wants to change their bad card luck, and only play when the odds are in their favor!"
3,Winning At Poker...,"So I just rented this book from the library and finished reading it. It was very well written in easy to understand terms. It was quite insightful, but there was nothing really groundbreaking in here.Btw, it focuses primarily on limit holdem and 7 card stud."
5,A low limit texas holdem masterpiece,This book is the best. The starting hand guide and explanation of the same on pages 64 and 65 are a stroke of genius. If one follows the guidelines the title of the book becomes a reality.I ordered 4 more copies of this book to give to my sons and friend since it is no longer in print
1,Impressive knowledge of grammar,"The author is very competent in his use of grammar and has a good grasp of the English language. If only he had a proper understanding of the art of telling a story, this book might have had a chance of sustaining the reader's attention. This pedestrian attempt at 'spinning a good yarn' was laughable in its cumbersome but predictable plot development. The characters were no more than silhouettes projected on a gossamer screen, so transparent that they simply expired in the overblown prose."
5,All Aboard for a GREAT TRAIN BOOK!,"CAN YOU HEAR THE WHISTLE BLOWING? . . .ummm, yes, you sure can! It's coming down the track, coming down the track, coming down the track!Patricia Newman delivers a zesty read about the world of trains. Told from the point of the engineer, you will learn train terms, facts, and just a fresh appreciation for the chugging world of transportation.Perfect resource for a transportation unit in the classroom.I also love the title. . .and I LOVE THIS BOOK!"
4,A good classic,"Good for those who may desire to know fundamental concepts of meteorite research with a historical perspective. When I pick up journal articles on the subject (i.e. ALH 84001--the ""famous Allan Hills Martian meteorite""), I realize the ""smallish"" volume delivers in the fundamentals but elicits a lot of curiosity and an honest desire to say: there must be more within the subject area. Having said that much, the book retains the original author's intentions of rigor (although it is updated to approximately 1992). I do recommend the book with caveat: if you need up-to-date information you will need to ""comb"" primary literature or spend much more cash on other volumes on the subject. But, it is a good read!"
4,"Very good, though not the best one","The explanation and examples are clear and useful indeed. Besides, the final test is a good idea. However, you'll find you got more right answers than the ones the book shows. :-)Finally, you might want something more advanced for some topics of the book (it's maybe too small to have all the rules); if that's your case, I recommend you ""A Handbook for Scholars."" Beware: this last one is not as ""reader-friendly"" as ""You Don't Say."""
5,Optimum Technologies Non-Slip Rug Tape,"Great stuff to have around the house, especially with wood floors or tile. Its even held up great in high traffic areas on the kitchen rug or mat by the back door."
4,Pretty Good Rug Gripper,Just tried out this rug gripper tape. It stuck to the concrete floor good but only time will tell if it stays put with traffic.
4,Its not perfect but it works,"You need a decent amount on a large area carpet (4'x8'). I placed three 3 foot strips and i feel it could be a little more grippier, maybe since i just laid it down it might need a while or if i put 2 more strips it would be real solid. Needless to say, its WAY better than before. The carpets not moving all over the place for sure. Great item overall."
4,Rug tape,"I used this product together with ""Optimum Technologies 425R-6 Rug Gripper Non-Slip Rug Tape"" for a long rug. Stays good for now"
1,Not what I expected,"I thought this would be easy and efficient to use. However, it was not and I put it in the trash. I followed the directions but found the gripper comes off as soon as you move the rug in any way. I would not recommend it."
3,To Slip or not to Slip...,"For the most part the product has worked but it is hard for the tape to stay put at the end of a runner. However, I do have a very energetic cat that races up the hallway, hence the slipping!"
4,Okay for rug on carpet,"We bought this to try to get our doormat from creeping under the door. The creep is definitely much less pronounced than it was (we used to have to reposition the mat every day), but I still have to tug the mat back into place once a week or so. So, it works better than nothing, but it's not a perfect solution if your floors are carpeted. I would definitely recommend this over carpet tape, though, which is not intended to be removable and will leave a mark on the carpet under the mat/rug."
4,Recommended for low use/budgeting,"I bought a couple of these rolls because I'm cheap and didn't want to pay for a bunch of area rug grippers. We have hardwood floors in our house and this tape sticks to them quite well.It's a simple issue though, these cover less area then your standard area rug grip. If you place this tape underneath rugs that are frequently traveled, they will shift. They do an ample job holding your rug in place but only for a limited time. If you're trying to save some money, these will work just fine. If you have the extra cash and you want your rugs to stay put, go with an area rug grip."
5,Great product!,This rug gripper works great. There is a large quantity of it so I was able to use in for several different rugs in my house. It's removable so it won't damage the floor and can be re-stuck if needed.
2,Does not hold stair treads,Optimum Technologies 425R-6 Rug Gripper Non-Slip Rug TapeBought this tape as it was recommended by the store where I purchased a set of stair treads. Even after using more of the tape on each tread than was indicated by the directions the treads still will not stay in place.
2,Only worked for a few weeks,"We are working on child-proofing our house and bought this to help with a big rug we have in the family room. It seemed to do the job for the first 2 weeks and then it stopped gripping the rug strong enough for it to be effective. The ends of the rug are now loose, which defeats the purpose..."
2,A disappointment.,"It's okay in dino mode, but not okay in robot mode. It's very hard to put together and keep it together. Some pieces come off easily, and then they are hard to put back on. I wanted to return it right away and get somethng else."
5,cows,This toy is really cool.I dont have it but my friend Jacob does he showed me all its features.It has great details.If you are a transformers fan this is the perfect toy.I give it an A+.
1,The Book of Myself: A do-it-yourself autobiography,"Had I known that the book was set up as it was I would have never purchased it, it was a waste of money in my eyes. I might just give to one of my grandchildren to use as a diary, as in my estimation that is all it is. Sorry I purchased it."
1,Do It Yourself Autobiography,"This book has no depth to it, no feeling or connection to feeling of any period of their life. It is juvenile and infantile.If you want a true discovery of who this person is/was, this does not make it!"
5,A wonderful gift to give.,"A gift for all ages. It says you are worth listenig to. The questions evoke pictures in one's mind making it easy to begin the journey. These are questions that one may need to share or just for private reflection.At first those who receive it may be intimidated by the idea of an auto-biography, but once any of the questions are read, the person becomes thoughtful and interested.I gave Two to my 16 year old niece, with a nice fountain pen, and asked her to keep one and give one to someone special. Some pages she will not be ready to fill out yet, and, I told her to leave a little space at the bottom of those she did fill out, some will be added to over the years.Everyone should have one. I just bought six more!"
3,It's a good start...,"I would disagree with the comment about this book being a waste of money. The book definately has a baby boomer slant to it-- if you're younger, entries such as ""I remember where I was when man first walked on the moon"" may be difficult for you to elaborate on (I was born a few months after that event...). My intention is to give copies to my parents and remaining grandparents. Someone commented that there was no place to write in the biographer's name so definately do that yourself. I would also recommend reading through the whole book (10 minutes?) before giving as a gift in case you want to change some of the questions or ask for other details."
5,Great,These are wonderful - I ordered this for a friend that was a teacher and just retired. She couldn't have been happier.
3,good,"This book is okay. It's not the best if you are mid twenties because it asks you about marriage, kids and later years. If you plan on keeping it and filling in the blanks later in life then it's fine"
3,A more serious alternative.,"Definately a more serious tone than books like ""Listography"" but that's not a bad thing. If you prefer really writing a record of your life, this is it. My only complaint is the ""early-medium-late"" life layout, it feels like you have to drag it out, not for someone who wants a quick, fun, book."
5,Examining Your Life,"I recently received this book as a sweet 16 birthday present. At first I thought it would just be a fun thing to do when I had some spare time. But now I realize, as I've started writing in the ""Early Years"" section, that this book will serve as the tale of my life -- something I can look back on when I'm older and my children can read with interest. It is not necessary to answer all the questions and you can work as quickly or slowly as you like. I only wish that my parents had written in one of these. Someday when I am in my eighties or so, I hope that I am still writing in it, and still remembering what it was like to be 16 again."
5,Not the same bottle/product as pictured...,"I order the body and face buffing beads as pictured here. Instead I received the body wash bath buffing beads. They are different...I love the product and I order it from Sephora a lot, just got the wrong stuff when ordering through this Amazon link.Update: Amazon is refunding me for shipping the wrong product. I am happy with Amazon's customer service product and I like the face scrub. :)"
3,Peter Thomas Buffing Beads,It does not leave a residue. I used this for my face as well. Sometimes the beads don't dissolve. The price is doesn't match the results however.
3,okay but not amazing,"I would rate this face wash as okay, nothing extraordinary. Its pretty mild and seems to do its job. I have been using it for the past 2 months and no real improvement, I still get the random acne so I'm still on the search for a better wash, but if I can't find it, I'll stick to this."
5,One of my favorites,"When I first bought this CD, it was for a select few songs. But as I listened to the entire CD, I realized that there was more to it than I had saw before. Now it has become one of my old ""stand ins"". Almost every night while I'm reading from my Bible, I listen to this CD. The differences in speed and the lack of singing makes it one of my favorites to help me relax and to help me get more excited about God's Word. I recommend it to anyone who needs a little pick me up in learning about the Grace of God."
4,Truly Inspired,"I've been blown away by this cd. I didn't realize Michael W. Smith was capable of such richly, moving orchestral compositions. I absolutely love it and find it very inspiring. Feels a little like a soundtrack from a great film. Maybe a little like ""Far and Away"". But there's a spiritual dimension that goes beyond description. It is epic in scope, encompassing a full emotional journey. Sometimes melancholy, maybe even tumultuous, but then victorious."
5,ANOINTED,"Since first hearing Micheal W. Smith's work at the age of 9 I have been thoroughly pleased at his progress and success. FREEDOM is a great way to minister to those who prefer not to listen to CHRISTIAN music. Completely acoustic, FREEDOM is a phenomenal collection of the manifestation of talent in Micheal.Out of all of his album's this would be my first reccomendation to buy before any of the other albums. Great as an inspirational option on a blue day, and wonderful for background music to videos.A W E S O M E ! ! !"
3,He's always been a great composer....,"Michael W. Smith has always been a great composer. As a matter of fact, he's composed some of the greatest melodies to ever be sung in the Christian community. However, along with those great compositions, he's also written some of the best lyrics FOR those songs. It's his lyrics that really touch the heart, for they carry teh deep message that we all need for understanding of life and spirit.I will say that this was quite the ambitious project. It was highly awaited by many--even myself. However, when I finally heard it, I felt that the magic in his previous works were a combination of the music and the lyrics. I know that with this instrumental album, I should separate the artist from the music, especially if he's got a body of work that has exceeded so many others. However, as an instrumental album, it's a fair collection of work.Smitty is a talented composer but the heart of his passion comes through in his lyrics and that was quite missed on this album."
5,hi Michael,Hi Michael (pleace excuse my english)my name is Coral and I am from Romania I am a cristian and i love Jesus very much I just whant to sey that i love you veri much and i thanck god for you and your music every dar. May god bless you and your famili! Coral
5,Do yourself a favor. Buy this CD!,"Wow. What an amazing CD.I didn't really know what to excpect from this CD when I ordered it. But after hearing it I am very glad that I did purchase it.Unlike many instrumental and soundtrack albums, every song on this album stands out and is memorable. There are a wide variety of songs to be found here, from the slower piano solos such as ""The Giving"" to the upbeat and triumphant Celtic-style compostions like ""The Call"".Overall, this is the best instrumental CD I have ever purchased. If you like any type of instrumental, soundtrack or celtic album you'll be sure to like this (and frankly, I don't see how ANYONE could dislike this album).Do yourself a favor. Buy this CD!"
5,love it!,"michael w smith comes through with this inspirational cd! the music is powerful and truly makes one feel closer to God. so often i will listen to this cd and feel as though the music is coming from within myself. after hearing it for the first time, i quickly gave my mom a copy and she loves it, too! it's so beautiful. it makes me feel at peace."
2,Hypnosis Lite,"While this book offers a few rudimentary hypnosis skills for those with limited training, it is otherwise the collection ofthe authors' self-promotions as their lectures. I would recommend any number of other books for those seeking to advance their skills including authors Yapko, Edgette & Edgette, Geary, and Zeig.Rick Voit, Ph.D.Author of ""Hypnosis in Clinical Practice"" (Routledge Publishing)"
3,More to old skool than hip hop,"I'm no expert here, but this cd made me realize there's more to breakdancing than Run DMC, Black Sheep, and the host of other beautiful jaw-breaking hip hop beats and tracks. Although this cd really could use more variety in the artist category, close your eyes when you listen and you'll be able to experience the other half of what made breakdancing what it is, low-end elektro beats and crude Speak-And-Spell sampling.This cd could be better, but appreciate it for what it means, rather than what it is."
5,A Have To Read!,"On The Far Side Of The Mountain, is sequel to My Side Of The Mountain. It is about a boy who runs away into the wilderness to live on his own. I liked this book because it is very adventourous and surprising. You never know what will happen next! If you have read Hatchet or My side of the Mountain you will love this book! You will also like it if you like action!"
4,Great Book,"On The Far Side of The Mountain by Jean Craighead George is an amazing book and has all of the right ingredients for a suspenseful survival novel. The main character, Sam Gribley, has run away from home and been living in the Catskill mountains for a year or so now. It is amazing how he uses nature to make things for every day living. His main food provider, a falcon named Frightful, has been taken away for legal issues. Without his falcon Sam is left to fend for himself.To find out what happens, read this great book that will keep you wanting to read more.I highly recommend this book for all ages, it is a classic!"
2,OTFSOTM Review,"On the Far Side of the Mountain is about Sam Gribley, who lives on the Catskill Mountains. He eventually is also burdened with his sister living there, and must leave the safety of the mountain to save her with his friend Bando.This book has some action and adventure, but not enough for my taste. I didn't appeal to that or the characters. It was basically about outdoor survival, which is much better done in other books, like Hatchet by Gary Paulsen.I would recommend reading other, more exciting books, like Hatchet,instead of this one."
5,On the Far Side of the Mountain,"On the Far Side of the Mountain is a great book! I thought it was just as good as the first book, My Side of the Mountain. The author is Jean Craighead George and I wish there were more books to the series. I especially recommend it if you like action and adventure. There are lots of parts when you don't know what's going to happen. It is very exciting. It is about a boy who has to live in the wild. You should read the first book before you read this one. I give it 5 stars!"
4,Visually Stunning,"We own this film, and the movie is just stunning to watch. There is a lot of communication that happens without a word ever being spoken due to the cinematography. It's a great story, and it is told very well."
4,Great characters,"After we all get done with the formulaic hollywood stuff that is drivelled out over us, this was an engrossing study in character. Loved the development of the friendships, backdrop to building of full, lush characters. it's one of those films that grabs you. this goes in my list of ""finds""..."
5,Im In Love!,"After seeing 'Steal this movie', I had no choice but to learn more about this incredibly crazy man. This book is amazing...it made me laugh out loud, think, ponder the idea of getting out there and causing a ruckus in the name of freedom. His writing flows...like old friends reminicing about their life changing experiences. What an insane, beautiful man. I can only hope that there will be more like him to come...our country needs a good jousting in the ribs!"
4,"Very nice, caught a bunch of fish for me!!!",Fished properly these can be deadly on pickerel and perch. A must have in your tackle box for your next hardwater adventure. I wish they made them in jumbo sizes as well.
1,Waste of money,"I am restoring a 1968 corvette so I purchased this book as one of many references required to complete a project like this. After reading through the somewhat small section dedicated to my year, I shortly discovered that some of the information was incorrect. I e-mailed the publisher with the findings they passed my concerns on to the author. I have not received any comment from the author or a refund for the purchase. Be careful of the product you buy. I would not recommend this book."
2,Totally Nuts,"Who the hell wrote this book? Reading the book just makes you crazy, it is defintely for a NCRS corvette restoration, information on any particular year is sparse and to indepth down to what color and numbers should be on your alternator, etc. Good book if you want to restore your vette like the day it rolled off of the assembly line in St.Louis. If you drive your corvette and don't have unlimited funds to restore it, dont waste your money on this book. This book is for old guys who want to spend 5 years (+) restoring there corvette to absolute stock condition."
5,Its awesome.,"I really liked this book and i really want a paddinton bear. Paddinton is so cute and somtimes I get annoyed because he makes trouble, but not on purpose. He reminds me of my little brother. Paddinton seems to get everything he wants because he dosn't really understand things.I wish I found this bear and got to own him!"
3,paddington at large,"I am a 21-year-old college student, and I gave the book 3-stars due to it being hard for me to follow. On the other hand, Paddington's shinanigans were pretty funny."
2,Boring for a child,"My daughter who is 11 thought is was extremely boring and hard to read. Mind you, her reading level is high third grade. It may have been written with children in mind, but my little girl didn't find it compelling at all, even though she is quite interested in spiritual things."
3,Excellent but Too Short,"This is the first Dweezil Zappa album in my collection and I must say I am glad I added it. Unfortunately, I feel like I only added half an album. This album has some great new songs with ""12 String Thing"" and ""Purple Guitar"" being the best tunes. Unfortunately, there were not enough new songs and way too many songs added simply to satisfy Dweezil's own fancies - see ""Hawaii Five-O,"" ""You're a Mean One Mr. Grinch,"" and two opera songs I'm still trying to forget. ""Automatic"" and ""Secret Hedges"" are very respectable tunes as well. But again, 4 or 5 good songs do not make a great album - hence 3 of 5 stars."
3,Superb playing; but weaker than his previous releases.,"Why hasn't ""My guitar wants to kill your mamma"" been released on cd? I had the album, and as every other that I had, I sold it thinking of buying the cd. Bad move. This is the only Dweezil's cd, and I can assure you, although he clearly shows his great talent, MGWTKYM is WAAAYYYYY better. Confessions is better, too."
2,Better than Confessions,"It's definitely taking him way too long to mature. Still a very good guitar player, an excellent shredder, but hardly a excellent musician. This guy may never be visited by the Muses and I am loosing hope."
3,"Definitely talented, but where are the good songs","I am a big fan of Zappa senior, and I recently branched out to Dweezil's latest. It was obvious from the start that the man can play, but I was disappointed with the end result. I just kept thinkin' stop playing ditties and play your guitar for real. Sound familiar? If there is a better Dweezil work out there I am still interested."
3,"An Anthology, not quite a ""Best Of""","Hailing from Canada, ANVIL has released its first album, ""Hard 'n Heavy"" back in 1981. This compilation covers material up to 1998's ""Speed Of Sound"" album, and includes a bonus track only previously available on the the japanese pressing of the ""Plugged In Permanent"" CD. This album showcases many of the most powerful ANVIL tracks. Unfortunately, because the material isn't presented chronologically, the production quality varies greatly, making this set a fair collection of good material but of variable direction. Still worth the money as an introduction to the band if you're missing a lot of their 11 previous albums."
2,Just did not move me.,Well written story that still failed to compel me into investing emotionally in either character. I was actually bored halfway through the novel.
1,"Lovely patterns, important information missing","The patterns in this book are lovely, but I find no indication about what size beads are used, nor is there any information about the quantity of beads. If I rated the book by its eye candy appeal, it would rate four or five stars, but because I might like to create one of the designs, I can give it only one star. I have no idea what beads to use."
1,Inaccurate,This thermometer reads 199 degrees in boiling water and 27 degrees in ice water. There does not seem to be any way to adjust it.
5,Nice intro,"Archie Shepp became one of the leading names in the jazz avant-garde movement of the 1960s when he joined forces with Impulse Records. Shepp received his share of criticism during this time, both for his political convictions as well as for his progressive approach toward the jazz medium. Most of the controversy stemmed from his involvement in black freedom movements and his open admiration for Malcolm X.Shepp's Impulse years feature some of his best music, featuring quite unusual readings of ""Naima"" and ""The Girl from Ipanema"". This CD offers a nice sampling from the mid 60s to early 70s, giving newcomers to Shepp a good place to start from. The sound quality is superb throughout on each of these tracks, making this disc a nice one to obtain if you want to get your feet wet with Shepp before jumping in the deep end."
5,Brilliant Christmas Alternative,"Jethro Tull plays Christmas? After the blasphemous Hymn 43 on Aqualung, and Ian Anderson's penchant for mocking religion, one might be a bit apprehensive. But fear not, O intrepid listener. This is a delightful collection of Christmas-oriented and seasonal songs, some original, others traditional, all with the familiar layered intricacy of Jethro Tull. The stylings of traditional tunes are great fun. Jack Frost and the Hooded Crow lends a nice dark edge to the mix. Bach's Bouree gets another fine rework, here in cut time. Martin Barre's ""A Winter Snowscape"" delivers a nice bit of acoustical guitar work to round out a very good album.So light the log, ye lads and lasses, pour a draught of Christmas ale, kick back and enjoy this holiday alternative."
4,Finally a Christmas CD from Jethro tull,"Ian Anderson has finally graced us with a Christmas CD.It was just a matter of time. Ian Anderson plays the Christmas classics as only he can. He uses a celtic style flute on several of the songs. Ian Anderson as you would expect comes up with exquisite arrangements, that only he would be able to doThe music is the type of music you would expect from Ian Anderson, acoustic music with alot of flute.Many of the songs are recycled songs from Tull's calalog, but there are some new songs that are truely Gems.God rest ye merry Gentlemen is very good. Pavane is also worth the listen.This CD will satisfy your sweet tooth for Jethro Tull and surprisingly will get you into the Christmas mood as well.Enjoy........................"
5,The perfect fit for the songs chosen,"This is another rock band who has been able to pull off a Christmas package and retain their classic sound. My favorite is probably the Ian Anderson composition 'Ring Solstice Bells', but the entire disc is a wonderful mix of original and traditional (I can't recall hearing a more sprightly version of 'God Rest ye Merry Gentlemen') with Anderson's Flute leading the way."
5,Feel Good CD,"I bought this CD for my husband, who is an avid Tull fan. He listens to it everyday. He says it is an excellent fell good CD. It is not a ""normal"" Christmas CD. It is just great Tull music."
4,Essential Christmas album for anyone!!,"This one of the few Christmas albums I own. I recommend this to Jethro Tull fans, as well as anyone who enjoys the christmas season."
3,Great Music,"Jethro Tull has always been one of the most creative artists and I was not disappointed by the music on this album. I was, however, a little disappointed that it was just an LP album that had been recorded to digital, no remastering. You can hear some of the dust pops when playing this CD, but the music is fantastic. A great Holiday album."
1,Seemed Anti-Christmas to me - more of winter solstice album,"After listening to this it just didn't feel right - it was not a celebration of Christmas and all that this holiday represents from either the secular or religious aspects, it seemed more about other things of winter, not at all the kind of uplifting celebration of Christmas that I want in my Christmas Holiday Music Collection - I wouldn't even give this away -it hit the TRASH!"
4,The Beginning of the End,"This album marks the beginning of the end for Jethro Tull. Not because the band is going downhill on its own, but because Ian is driving it that way forcibly.Here is where Ian starts to replace the top-notch, virtuostic players that have always made Tull the most musical band on the face of the planet, with people like his son, James Duncan Anderson, who, forgive me for being blunt, is a hack percussionist and utterly incapable at the throne.Now he has replaced just about everyone else (except Martin) with second rate musicians that just can't play at the level which his compositions demand. And why? to save a buck. So Ian Anderson can die a rich man.Tosh. This album is not bad, there's some really great playing, great fun arrangements of traditional tunes, but, there are a few spots where you wince at James' playing ability... and there will be a lot more of that if this new concert lineup stays. We're going to begin to miss Doane, Andrew and John."
2,i dunno,i listened to this and id have to say this is a horrible cd for jethro. i know them very well i have been a fan since day 1. this cd has no guitar. if you are a fan of tull for their ROCK music dont buy this there is like no electric guitar in this cd. its mostly flute music. i hope jethro comes back to rock soon because after track 5 of this cd i hate it
1,"It's come to this, has it?","I think someone bungled in his jungle and mixed up the intended cover with the cover of ""The Jethro Tull Halloween Album""--gabled haunted house, foreboding bare trees (rather than frosted evergreens) with ominously (and unrealistically) twisted branches.But I'm here to review the music, not the cover....Oh, never mind. What's the point? You've heard these songs before. Now you get to hear them recut by a tired, uninspired, rundown band and a singer whose voice has expired.Whatever. See you in Vegas then?"
5,A CHRISTMAS CLASSIC,"This is an absolutely phenominal collection of holiday treasures. The instrumentals, in particular, are mind blowing. These renditions take you right into the holiday spirit in 3 seconds flat.I was always a fan of ""Songs From the Wood"" era Tull and wished they'd spent a bit more time exploring that avenue back in the late seventies. Well, I just never figured it would happen over 20 years later. This one is worth the wait.This CD was released a few years back but still stands in the front of the line. Other rock xmas albums come and go but this one kicks all of their butts year after year after year!!!!!"
3,Phoned it in,"If the actual music weren't so good, this wouldn't deserve the three-star rating. To be honest, the re-recorded songs (Solstice Bells, Christmas Song, Jack Frost & the Hooded Crow etc.) sounded better on the original recordings than they do here. But they're still really good songs. The newer ones, particularly the instrumentals are uneven, but work as background music, and this collection beats most shrill holiday fare hands down. A good antidote to Mariah or Christina, but if you're here, you probably know that anyway."
4,A Yuletide gem,"This is an extremely eloquent and satisfying work from Ian, Martin & Co. The best of it's genre out there. However, Tull music is hard to catagorize or pigeonhole due to it's eclectic nature. It is, for all intents and purposes, put in the prog-rock catagory, which is fine, but they are far more than that. Ian Anderson is a master songwriter, and they are all masters of the many and varied instruments they play. As is stated on the package, if you liked Thick As A Brick, Songs From The Wood, and Heavy Horses, you will love this album. It's a nice mix of jazz, classical, rock, & folk elements, and captures the feel of the season unlike any Christmas record out there, past & present. I recommend this record to fans and non-fans alike. It will be a welcome addition to any holiday collection. If your're a fan of the flute, and rock flute in particular, I don't think you'll be dissapointed. Ian is an uniquely gifted flute player, truly one-of-a-kind!"
3,Not a must have - but quality,"Good quality Tull material, some quite excellent in fact. Great production-one of their best sounding recordings ever."
5,As Wonderful as I expected!,I would highly recommend this to any Tull fan who also loves Christmas! It was hard putting it away with the decorations after the holidays!
5,Instant Classic,"I hadn't listened to Jethro Tull in over twenty years, when in a mood of nostalgia I put on ""Heavy Horses"" and instantly hooked my twelve-year old son on Tull. This CD sounds like it could be made up of outtakes (and for Tull, even outtakes are often masterpieces; e.g. ""Broadford Bazaar"") from the band's heyday in the 70s. ""Jack Frost and the Hooded Crow"" could have been on ""Songs from the Wood,"" ""First Snow on Brooklyn"" sounds like a return to the emotional and musical terrain of ""Minstrel in the Gallery,"" thirty years later (""I believe it only rained around here these thirty years,"" say the lyrics). And ""We Five Kings"" is a brilliant hybrid of ""We Three Kings"" and ""Living in the Past."" Ian Anderson still has a great, distinctive voice, and his flute and Martin Barre's guitars sound better than ever. Highly recommended for those, like me, who have always wished there was more of ""Songs from the Wood"" and ""Heavy Horses."""
5,Pure Tull,"This an excellent cd from start to finish. Great package, full lyrics/credits. The bonus dvd is a bit short on running time, only three tracks and is in 2ch stereo only, picture and sound are great. I'm sure the purists will go back and listen to the original versions of some of the older tracks and prefer them to the rerecorded tracks as I did. But I salute Jethro Tull for a first class product. 16 tracks/62.18. The photos of the band members inside the booklet, they are indeed starting to show their age."
5,Christmas Music at its finest!,"We saw Jethro Tull in concert and they played some of the music you will find on this CD. I highly reccommend it. It does not diminish the beauty of Christmas music, but enhances it with a fresh new approach. Let me assure you, I have been a fan since the 70s and this is Jethro Tull at their best! Why settle for Bing Crosby when you can have REAL music this holiday season!"
5,"Great music, Christmas or otherwise","I don't generally give a damn about Christmas music, but I listened to this at a friend's suggestion and it's fantastic."
2,nearly the real thing..,"Not as much Bible Doctrine in the lyrics as I thought there'd be...nonetheless, Christ is acknowledged for the time of year we all dig into."
4,Chesapeake Blue,Final book in the four book series left me wanting more of the story! It left off with more to tell and more to learn. Such fun to read!
5,Perfect Ending to a Wonderfully Told Story!!!!,"(Chesapeake Blue, Seth Story bk 4) A Perfect Ending to a Beautifully Told Story....I REALLY loved this Story from begining to END it made me laugh and it made me Cry...I first read this story 12/2009 I LOVED it then and EVERY time I Re-read it afterwards including this time!!!! Amazing Characters,and a BEAUTIFUL STORY!!BRAVO NORA ROBERTS BRAVO!!!!"
4,Chesapeake Blue,"Seth Quinn is all grown up and has returned home. He is a very successful artist, and while his family is excited to see him, they know something is wrong.Gloria DeLauter is Seth's biological mother. She has been making threats to all he holds dear. While he is now an adult, her presence brings out his insecurities and old fears Seth thought he had banished. He has been paying her blackmail for years, but when she ups the ante; Seth knows he has to go to his family for help.This is a good conclusion to the series. In this book we see the family dynamic come full circle. They laugh, argue, but they do it all as a family."
2,Disappointed,"I hated that he had been paying blackmail to Gloria since the age of 14. She had nothing to blackmail him about.The other thing that was even worse was the illogic of Gloria at all. Someone who is a prostitute and addicted to drugs, simply is not going to live that long. If she does manage it, her brain would have been fried and she would have been in no shape to manipulate anybody.I am also disappointed that the romance did not involve Audrey."
3,Liked it better before I read the other Quinn books: SPOILERS,"This is the first of the Quinn books I read, and I enjoyed it enough that I immediately went out and chased down the original Quinn trilogy. After I read them, I started having questions about Seth's story. Spoilers: After seeing how much stronger Seth was by the end of Phillip's novel, I had trouble believing that he'd cave to Gloria's blackmail in Chesapeake Blue. I could see him being afraid enough of Gloria to give in to her when he was a teenager, but not when he was in his late twenties. Maybe if he'd only been 20 or 21 in Chesapeake Blue the blackmail plot would have seemed believable. But not when he's older. Considering the family ties would have just grown stronger between Seth and the adults, I think he would have gone to Cam and Anna if the blackmail continued after he was 16 or 17. I still really enjoyed the book, though."
3,Didn't we already read this???,Unlike alot of diehard Nora fans I can't say I was dying for this story I would have been just as happy for it to have stayed as it was but at the same time I still look forward to it. The best part was meeting up with the brothers and their families. As for the story what bothered me the most is this story was already told. Seth's mother comes back to blackmail everyone and cause trouble sorry but that already happened in the previous books why tell it again. Also if they are such a close knit who are always there for each other why would Seth have been paying her off since he was 14. O.K. she threatened the kids but after he matured you think he would have gone to them so I think it's lame.Plus if Gloria is such a drug user you'd think she'd be dead by now. My review is that it was o.k. but hardly one of her best.
4,A great Finale for the Quinn serise,Seth finally finds love. With the help of his brothers he finally has a fase-off with his Mother. A great ending for the serise
3,Not one of her best,"First let me say that Nora Roberts is an incredibly gifted writer and that for anyone else this would be a really good book, but she can do better. I read the other three books in this series a while ago and they were great. This one is a bit contrived. The story and the romance are much weaker than the previous Quinn sagas. If you read the other three books you will want to find out what happens to Seth and all the other Quinns but I suggest you go to the library or wait for the paperback."
3,I'M NOT SURE IF I LIKE THE QUINN BROTHERS,"SO FAR I'VE READ INNER HARBOR AND CHESAPEAKE BLUE. I'M NOT IMPRESSED WITH THESE BOOKS. I FELT AS THOUGH DRU AND SETH'S ROMANCE WAS FORCED AND THEY DIDNT SEEM TO BE COMPATIBLE IN ANY WAY. I THINK THAT THE ONLY INTERESTING THING ABOUT THIS BOOK WAS CAMERON AND ANNA. THEY SEEM TO BE SO IN LOVE, MAYBE I SHOULD READ ABOUT THEM.ONE THING I DO NOT UNDERSTAND IS WHY SETH DIDNT MENTION TO HIS BROTHERS ABOUT GLORIA. DID HE NOT TRUST THEM ENOUGH TO CONFIDE IN THEM? HIS WHOLE FAMILY KNEW ABOUT GLORIA AND HER TRICKY WAYS AND YET SETH STILL TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF TO PAY HER OFF EVERY TIME. HASNT HE LEARNED ANYTHING IN TWENTY YEARS? ANYWAYS, EVEN THOUGH I WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THESE BOOKS I WOULD RECOMMEND READING THEM, ESPECIALLY INNER HARBOR. THAT BOOK WILL ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT SETH AND THE REASONING FOR HIS ADOPTION."
5,Nora Roberts - quinn brothers,Book arrived well with time limits and in good condition; would order from this seller again.
4,Ok to better,"The book was in good shape on first glance. As I finished reading the book, the last 4 pages were torn making the top 1/3 of the page impossible to read. It was frustrating but I was able to read the rest of the book and get the idea how the book ended."
3,SHOULD HAVE STAYED A TRILOGY,"I think this is the only lukewarm review I have ever given Ms. Roberts/Robb. I generally love all her books. However, in this case the Quinn brothers trilogy should have stayed a trilogy. We already knew they lived happily ever after. This book was a stretch to continue the story. I had a hard time picturing Seth as an adult. Also, to think that he would have kept paying his mother blackmail money over the years was ludicrous. Don't get me wrong--I read the book and still loved the Quinn family, but I could have lived without it."
3,An ok read.,"If you've read the first three books in the Chesapeake Bay Saga, you will want to read this one as well. However, the story line is lacking & disappointing."
2,not worth it,I found this one to be quite disappointing and predictable. Seth's character didn't have the 'meat' to it that I had expected
3,Seth all grown up was Strange.,"I will say starting off, that having read about young Seth for so long in the other books, it was hard to get used to reading about him being alluring to women. I kept picturing him as a little boy and it was difficult to put him in the roll of the adult hero. The whole thing with his mom was strange to me. Were we really supposed to find her threatening? SO anyway, I just love Anna and it was great to hear her yelling again. Other than seeing the others and their progression, I felt like I was watching my little brother have sex and it was just not working."
5,Great Audio Book,"I bought the CD unabridged. It's the first time I read Nora Roberts and did not realize that there is a series. I had no trouble following the story line without reading the previous triolgy. (which I just ordered). If you spend alot of time driving you will love this CD. It's easy to listen to, interesting and gets ""spicy"" in just the right spots. I loved the plot and characters. The ending was predictable, but I'm glad it ended the way it did. I would not have enjoyed it if it did not have a ""happy ending"". Buy the CD....It's a little pricey, but well worth the cost."
5,You thought it was over with the trilogy..then it got better,"It is perfect. I read the first three books and whenever I get finished with one of Nora's books I hate that that's it, that there is no more. But then I was in the mall and passed be a book store and guess what I saw on display. The fourth in the Chesapeake Bay series.It was everything I had expected and so much more. That was the closure that I needed to these books.Don't get me wrong though! I would not object to another book in the series. Wink wink nudge nudge"
5,Just as described...,Received this book in the description described. Price was excellent. Received it in a timely manner.
4,"Great, as per usual...","I love Nora Roberts, and especially when she writes sagas. This fourth book in the Chesapeake Bay saga is great. I loved seeing Seth as a grown up, as well as the closeknit family dynamic. At first, I wasn't too sure about Dru but as the story went along she grew on me, and I think she's the perfect balance to Seth."
3,Romance formula,"Nora Roberts has the romance formula down pat. Readers know what will happen within the first 30 pages of her books, but they still clamor to read the numerous mini-series which she has written. In this book, Seth Quinn returns to his home and family on Chesepeake Bay after honing his artistic skills in Paris for several years. He meets a beautiful woman named Dru Whitcomb (on p. 30) and begins his pursuit of her. She has been betrayed by a man she was engaged to and is understandably reluctant to enter another romantic relationship. Seth has his own secrets, especially his dysfunctional mother who haunts him with demands for blackmail money in return for her keeping their sordid past a secret. This is a cut above some of Roberts' books, but is still pretty predictable."
2,Dont' Bother,Let me first say that I loved this series by Nora Roberts. It was one of my favorite series to read! That being said this fourth book in the series isn't worth your time. This book was nothing like the first three books. I was so excited to read this one because it is about Seth and you get to see how things turn out for him. I was very disappointed. I didn't like the women he falls for...and didn't think they had much chemistry at all. I actually quit reading this book in the middle of it because I was so bored and started another book. I came back to it a few months later and finished it out of obligation to finish the series and know how it ends. It was painful though and I wouldn't reccomend this book to anyone.
1,Chesapeake Blue,Wonderful story - continues the grasp Nora Robert holds her readers in. A true tale weaver - never lets her readers down
3,Chesapeake Blue,"I liked this book and was glad I read it, but I was a little disappointed in the main character. I have read the 1st 3 books of the Chesapeake series by Nora Roberts in which the main character of this book, Seth, was a 10 - 11 year old boy. I was so excited to get this book to finish the series as I had read the first chapter found at the end of my copy of ""Sea Swept"". I absolutely loved the first three books and fell in love with the 4 brothers, Seth being the youngest of the brothers. Seth didn't seem true to the character developed in the first 3 books. He was weak. All the other characters remained true to form. Seth was a boy & Aubrey was 1-2 years old in the first 3 books and her grown up character was much more true to form than Seth's character."
2,How to organize,"Not enough advice on building sales or recruiting skills. The author provides common sense advice like keeping a clean desk, being on time, looking sharp. If you are looking for ways to improve your professional selling skills--this is not the book. For those who need a refresher in using common sense this book is for you."
2,Why did Strathern write this book?,"I've observed that there are roughly two groups of literary people: those who appreciate Dostoevsky's works and those who don't. The author of this book sits firmly in the latter group, which begs the question, ""Why did he write this?"" He is quick to point out the faults of Dostoevsky's major works, but then trips over his words and arguments in meager attempts to describe the positive attributes. Indeed, if I were to base my opinion of Fyodor Mikhailovich and his works solely on this book, I would be quick to label him a neurotic right-wing nut job who couldn't write his way out of a paperbag. In short, if you're looking for a book that will help you better understand Dostoevsky and his works, this isn't it."
3,only if you've already read the books,"Spoiler alert: at the end of the book Strathern says ""his work is not so much literature as raw spiritual experience."" I loved reading that. It nailed something I haven't been able to express that simply myself. However, I bought it for my niece who is just finished Anna Karenina, and I'm not planning to give it to her. He's not Tolstoy, you won't float along in awe. He makes you work. He makes you deliver your own redemption. His novels are not full of pull quotes and famous single lines. But they can change your life. So if you're interested in Dostoevsky, it might be better to start with something short like ""Diary of a Madman"" and see if it pulls you in. Skip this book - he doesn't get it."
5,A GREAT MOVIE,"Some man must think about his life after this film. Superb, stylish and gave things to think."
1,Over rated,This product was fairly expensive and did not perform as well as a Water Pik with the irrigation attachment. It also died within about 60 days. The Water Pik's die as well but they cost about 1/3 to 1/2 the price and last about 6 months. For my money I was not happy.
1,Bad,"This book was in a bad condition....couldn't even read it, had to throw it away it was so dirty...was not pleased with one of my first purchases from this site, which is what earned it this rating."
3,Out of focus,"Compositions and musicians are wonderful, but the recording is not. The production lacks in an accurate recording of an orchestra."
3,Fatally flawed,"The sound quality of this is not even a factor in my low rating of the cd. We do not have any other way to experience perhaps one of the most important moments in all of music. It is the fact that ""Black, Brown, and Beige"" is split between two discs that should keep anyone from buying this. Do whatever you can to find this performance on LP (where the poor sound quality isn't so bothersome, I might add.) The fact that the suite was performed as a unified whole here is what distinguishes this performance as such a gem. I would happily have paid for a three cd set to get ""Black, Brown, and Beige"" together on one disc. Even the 10 seconds a good cd changer takes to switch discs is too much in this case. still, if you have no other way to access this show, it will be far from a waste of your money."
5,adidas hoodie,I bought this for my husband and he is satisfied with the quality and fit. He likes the fact that the hood is lined so he doesn't get fleece fuzz in his hair.
2,i didnt get what i want,"i oder 3x not 2x i ask them if they coule oder big 3x sd they could'nt they were out of stock, but could not oder it, i wil l never order things again from amz thanks dianne wright"
4,It's a Good Sweatshirt,"How to review a sweatshirt...I like Adidas fleece sweatshirts like this. They've got good colors, don't fade much if you wash them properly, and they're stylish. Of this type, I picked up a vibrant orange one which lets people see me from about 30 miles away, and a grey one. The logo isn't overbearing... it's just enough to say it's a good brand. But mroe than anything, this... is... so... soft. With the fall and winter coming up, I'm glad I have my fleece sweatshirts. Although... technically there are others that are great too. But... these are great cause' I also matched them perfectly with several Adidas headbands.And that is my review on this sweatshirt. It's soft and warm; perfect if you went to the gym for a work-out, showered, and want something soft for the way home."
3,Just passable!,"I have read this book and although it was very accurate and well written, it was not the sort of book that I was not able to put down. I would recommend this book to anyone who is fascinated by minute detail."
4,hardcore gods,"Every track an anthem of american hardcore, you can't distinguish if it is LA or NY HC style, and that is what is good in this band. The singer's voice is very similar to Henry rollins's, which is too a positive fact. HC enthusiasts will certainly freak out with this compilation, it is NOT a full lenght, it is a kind of ""best of"". a true blend of bad brains and black flag, just a few tracks will make you wish to jump, scream, mosh, stage dive and start a circle pit."
1,Where's the warmth and feeling?,"This artist, who is imitating 15-year-old Welsh singing sensation Charlotte Church, clearly has no warmth or feeling. While it is evident that Ms. Russe can hit the high notes, her words are sharp and irritating. My advice to anyone who reads this is: BUY THE ORIGINAL. Ms. Church's version, though she was only 13 at the time of the recording, is warm and pleasant, like the song should be."
3,Nice Side arm,This pistol is a great backup weapon. it will fit most holsters and has a decent (not great) range. Great for those times you get caught between reloads and need to get that kill shot out.
2,I don't like it that much,"This gun sucks. I bought this pistol and the trigger mechanism broke. The fps is o.k. for the price, but not that bad. The idea of taking off the top is kind of cool, but the pistol begins to act up until it breaks.(p.s. this is my moms account)"
5,Role of Christian personalism vs. ideological de-humanization,"The role of Christian anthropology cannot be over-estimated as a factor sustaining dissidence and ultimately destroying communism. The role of the East German Church my not have bewn as overt or dranatic as in Poland, but the underlying theology of individual dignity and freedom is at the very basis of western civilization. A valuable point to consider in the future."
5,John Gray is brilliant once again!!!,"Dr. Gray offers guidelines and advice that makes sense. The information is helpful and seems to validate my gut feeling on most of his suggestions.Just as with the Mars Venus advice for adults in relationships,dating, starting over, getting in touch with feelings, or learning how to get what you want, Children Are From Heaven simply stated makes sense!"
1,don't waste your time,"This book was very difficult to read and made me wish the entire time that the author would just get to his point. He also made a lot of statements with nothing to back it up. Maybe he thought we were one of his children that shouldn't have things explained to them and should just happily want to do whatever he suggested. I am a young mother, but I guess my view in his light are old fashioned. I think this type of psycho babble leads to the irresponsible adults that I now unfortunately manage- that think that everything should have some kind of reward. Please if you love your children and want what is best, don't follow this book."
2,So what's new?,"Common sense, but hard pressed to find anything new and enlightening. I was suspicious about the author's over emphasis on the parents being the ""boss"" all the time. And I was even more suspicious why the author left out common ideas about parents investigating their own childhoods and their issues from childhood being resolved, unresolved, or still in denial about. Or, to put it another way, what negative or shadow parts of parents are likely to be put onto their children. A very simplistic book with no guts and void of suggesting current parents deal with their painful past. No wonder he is popular with a society in massive denial and addiction."
3,Good advice....hidden in 350 pages of poor editing.,"I am a huge fan of John Gray's. His books on adult relationships are wonderful. This one confuses me - it's not up to his standards. There are good points made, but the book is a chore to read. Also some conflicting advice throughout. I wish he'd re-think this and re-write it. In the meantime, if you want a good book on positive parenting try one of these: Positive Discipline, Kid Cooperation, The Discipline Book, Perfect Parenting."
4,I'd wish I had this book when my children were infants.,This book provides some excellent advice to parents in child rearing. I only wish I had this book and knew about postive parenting when my children were first born. I am trying to incorporate the suggestions into dealing with my 13 year old twins boys and my 18 year old daughter. Positive parenting methods are also worthwhile for dealing with adult relationships too.I recommend it to all parents and suggest it as a perfect baby gift.
3,Great theories but little editing,"This book has some wonderful theories that I hope to practice,but reading through this book was tedious because of the lack ofediting and repetition. I feel like marking up the book and returning it to the publisher, if only I had time. This book needs to be edited and re-released. Publishing this book in such a state reflects poorly on the Publisher and the Author.I also disagree with the notion that children today are more sensitive than older generations were when they were children. Dr. Gray didn't say much to back up this premise, but I do not believe that this is at all relevant to his message."
4,Read it and think.,This book is better than Venus/Mars books. If you're a parent or want to be or are going to be read this. Even if your children are past 'the formative years'--you may someday have grand kids and the same great advise works for them too.
2,Did John Gray rush to write this or what?,"It seems like a book that was written in a rush. There are even typos in the book (he uses ""where"" instead of ""were"" and other spell check glitches...). Seems elementary. I couldn't read more than the first half and then I put it down. I was hoping for something insightful, but just got a dozen theories all jumbled into one book without much explanation."
1,boring boring boring,"I started to read this book and it lost my interest quick! I read the first 38 pages and never picked it up again. My friends agreed that its very repetitive & boring.There is many excellent parenting books out there, don't waist your valuable time on this one."
2,A few good ideas in too many words,"I agree with other reviewers that there are a few good ideas, but many too many words. Lots of repetition. Nothing really specific and nothing really new. He even uses the concept of Positive Parenting like he invented the term, which has been used by Jane Nelson for years. There are many other better, more concise and more specific books out there."
5,HEY SHADOW,"Opens w/ the punchy, jumpy, Fast strumming vibe of HEY SHADOW. Full of Energy and pop from the very start. Big, big feel to instrumentation and sound on this ep!! Garage grunge feel to the rasp in the vocal kick of this recording over a raw amp sound of crunchy crunchy very true to original punk guitars UNPOLISHED N PERFECT. Every track brings heat feels high voltage, million miles an hour playing. The closing track SUPERPOWER is a Perfect Finale' great screechin solo thrown on it, its a power closer. Each track holds its own on the ep and fits together perfect as a 6 song collection. No let downs. Throwback Old School Punk form and tons of new school Energy. HUMPERS got as close as you can to punk perfection here!! THESE VERSIONS OF THE SONGS THT DO APPEAR ON THE FULL LENGTH LP ARE WAY MORE RAW N TRUE TO THE ESSENCE OF GRITTY RAW SOUND n NOT AS MUCH OVERPRODUCTION."
2,Fire the director !!,"Love Peter , but this DVD is terrible. The director keep change scenes every 2 seconds !! I don't want to see all the unknown in the background more than Peter !!"
4,Could have been excellent.,"The concert is excellent. My only dissapointment was that being released in blu ray format I was actually expecting additional footage or bonus materials but unfortunately this blu ray release has omitted one song Hard To Say I`m Sorry which is found on the normal DVD format. With the blu ray format, additional space could have catered for more bonus material. What happened?????. Thats the only reason this is getting a four star review."
4,Still a good buy,A pitty that the classic song Hard To Say I'm Sorry is not included. Some may find him lack of stage charisma to lead the audience but I'm sure you'll sing along once you play it (which me and my wife did). The orchestra blend in so well the every song is so smooth and easy to the ears.
5,"Really, really, really works","We originally bought this product to clean up messes from our elderly dog with (bowel) incontinence and it worked wonders. It eliminated the smell, did not stain the carpet and kept the three younger dogs from the spots. Mr. Riley recently passed away and someone who shall remain nameless peed onto and into my wife's brown suede FitFlop clogs. She was going to chuck the clogs but then decided to apply this product. OMG! It worked! No staining, no odor. We bought the smallest bottle first, just to make sure that it worked. Now we're investing in the big one. A must have for pet stains."
4,"Fragmentary Pieces Number One, a poem","London Bridge, the sky is falling, and Humpty Dumpty fell off the wall.H. D. came from Bethlehem.And so did Jesus. And they took Him down from the cross.It's in Arizona now, over a river with almost no water.London, so bleak!I came, I saw,and I came again, and then,I conquered.The spoils of war!Venti, Vidi, Vici!And Vico and His-tory, and the end of it.The conquest of Mexico and Peru, they didn't even re-cognize you!No wonder, His-story is coming to an end!copyright, T G Rex, Tucson, Arizona, 16 December, 1999"
1,Best Concept since the Thousand Year Reich,"Manifestos of cultural superiority, a la Huntington's Clash of Civilizations and this wrong headed venture are recipes for excusing genocide. The end of the world described in this book has come and gone just like the end of every other imperial dream must ultimately crumble. The barbarians of China or India will ultimately supercede the dreamed of homogenous world order that never existed and never will."
3,Flawed Theory,"I have to admit that this is not an easy book to read. I struggled to finish this book (therefore you can imagine how dry is the material).Fukuyama's theory of history is made up of the conflicting ideology of democracy and communnism is, I must say, a little too simplistic. History is definitely more than that!"
1,Consider the source . . .,"I did enjoy this book when i first read it two years ago. However, with the invasion of Iraq, I discovered the author, Professor Fukuyama, is a member of the warmongering group (Project for a New American Century PNAC) along with Rumsfield, Pearle, and i think Cheney.Upon relection, it seems this book serves to propagandize to assist in the inflicting of The American Way on weaker nations.Noam Chomsky is a much better source of information on what kind of democracy is practiced by the powerful nations."
1,A fully understood misunderstanding,"Fukuyama misunderstands history in a way that is not entirely his own. One need only leaf through the pages of Hegel to find such unfounded optimism.As a scholar, I recently took a look at what would be the continuation of Fukuyama's statistical work. That is, the growth of democracy, and it's funny how that growth has been curbed in the past 10 years or so. Time will show this book to be Fukuyama's Folly!"
1,what an idiot,"Hasn't this author committed seppuku by now? His thesis is ridiculous. I'm surprised the publisher doesn't shamefacedly order all copies pulled from the shelves.I'm not a history professor, but he is. Thus even back in 1992 he should have guessed what was going to happen when Islam met globalization."
5,One of the most important books of this century,"Contrary to the common interpretation, Fukuyama, in fact, predicts the implosion of liberal democracy because of its inherent contradiction between liberty and democracy. Liberty encourages differentiation among people, while democracy is predicated on equality. Understanding the implications of this contradiction is critical for all of us living in the end of History."
4,Fascinating,"A fascinating analysis of the cultural, economic and emotional aspects of modern post Cold War political theory. Even though the book was written after the breakup of the Soviet Union its principles still hold water in the 21st century as well"
5,A must-read even for the lay public,"This book deeply impressed me. Before I started reading it, I was skeptical concerning the author's views. But after completing it I can only nod my head in full agreement. Not only does he do an excellent job in articulating and defending his position, the seven years that have passed since the book's publication confirm the trends that he describes. In addition, Mr. Fukuyama is a wonderful writer in that his writing style flows almost like a story. Finally, I would hate to think that potential readers would be reluctant to buy the book fearing that its prognosis for society is a negative one. On the contrary, the message is optimistic. Even inspirational. I would recommend this book even for people who have no interest in history, politics, sociology, or even reading for that matter. Enjoy."
5,Great insights,"I remember when Richard Dawkin's selfish gene was taken literally by a member of Parlement, who wondered if the opposition party was afflicted by the genetic disorder. Fukuyama's ""End of History"" has been taken the same way. This is a fabulous work about the philosophical ""Last Man"", not about the final homo-sapien. Once past the title, this work expresses some of the best philosophical thinking about our current society. It's ""final"" supposition may speak correctly about capitalism and democracy but the future is full of other possibilities, so I would oppose that position. However, as a superb explaination of 20th-21st century man, this work has no competition."
2,No Such Animal,"There is no End To History. It goes on in multiple ways, no matter how much triumphalist rhetoric celebrated the illusory, temporary ""victory"" of a fleeting form of neoliberalism (not true democracy) in the late 20C. With such a foundation of sand, the pretentious Hegelianism that rests on it is superfluous and insupportable. Two stars for stimulating debates (mostly the original article), and for coining a neat phrase. But there's no ""there"" there, at least not enough to successfully transition from article to full-length book. BTW, Fukuyama's institutional connections do not impress. Like many intellectuals who align with statist and corporatist views, he prefers to hide in unaccountable think tanks that function as echo chambers. Facing bright students in open and honest class discussion, let alone the peer-review process or independent-minded academics, is not for the likes of him."
5,One of the most relevant books I ever read.,"I bought this book titillated by its title: it was eerily reminiscent of a story I had read or heard somewhere about those who were seriously suggesting in the late 19th. century France to close the Patent Bureau, since ""everything that had to be invented was already invented"". (Can anybody help me find a bona-fide printed source for this gem or is it just an unsubstantiated annecdote?). What a surprise to find how wonderfully and intentionally misleading (or titillating?) this title was.This is one of those books which, in spite of reading it with a pen in hand and marking it up copiously, when I reached the end I felt a compelling need to read it again. It is not a question of agreeing or disagreeing with the author, but a question of getting intellectually stimulated in a way few books did it for me. An educational tool to be highly recommended for any age group."
5,Bravo! A truly educational account of history.,"You may not agree with every point that Mr. Fukuyama makes about history and humanity, but at the very least you should be stimulated to think about historical events with a new perspective. His is a wonderfully researched and developed account of something that I wondered sometimes: why are we here, and where are we going?"
2,Arc of history,"Ideological certitude and its bastard cousin ""the true believer"" have taken this country to places it should not have gone in the last decade. We have fallen far from the Greek ethos of ""white pebble, black pebble"" on true democratic principles. When western democracies are goaded, bullied, beguiled and cajoled into wars that are still reverberating to this day, we are allowing elected officials the decisions of kings.Until we can vote on consensual bloodletting there is no liberal democracy. We have not come very far in the last 1000 years at all.This book and its central tenet are fraudulent."
4,New point of view about human history,"In an economic world, we all analize economic and political facts based on materialist theories (Marxist theory of value). Fukuyama shows us a differnt way of thinking that lets us understand past, present and future events."
5,Read the Whole Book,"Reviews typically focus on the ""end of history"" part of Fukuyama's argument, and tend to forget the ""last man"" part (the former derived from Hegel and the later from Nietzsche). But they cannot be separated, and it is the last man argument that is particularly trenchant today. Are we willing to forgo any comfort or security _at all_ (never mind major sacrifices) to vindicate a closely held value? I think the reaction of the French and the Germans to recent events indicates that we are indeed becoming the ""men without chests."""
4,Sabrent usb 2.0 to sata/ide Hard Drive Adapter,"It was not really easy to set up right out of box. But, thanks to the reviews of people that have used it previously, I was able to get it up and running. What a wonderfull way to access old hard drives right from your desk. It works great and is very resonable in price. Especially when you are able to get files that you had on your old computers hard drive without having to install it in a computer, in order to read from it."
4,Works well but cheaply made,"This adapter works very well. I've had it for almost a week and I've tried a couple 2.5 form factor hard drives, a SATA DVD burner, an old IDE 3.5 form factor HD and a SATA 3.5 form factor HD.It worked great for all of these on my computer and on a secondary computer.The only thing I do not like about it is the cheap plastic. I tend to work fast and rush things and I've already broke the plastic lip off of the SATA part of the connector of the Molex to SATA adapter cable. It still works fine but I have to be careful.Also I am nervous that the main retangular plastic piece that connects either IDE/SATA is going to break. It is very flimsy and cheap.All in all it works fine. I am happy with it.You just have work slow and carfully with this adapter when using it."
1,Burnt my SATA drive,Connected to an IDE HDD several times. It works. But the power supply gets really hot after a few minutes.Connected to a SATA laptop drive. The hard disk didn't mount at all. It made my drive inaccessible that I could no longer access it later when I re-installed on my laptop computer. It seems like it totally fried the SATA drive.I wouldn't recommend this product at all!
4,Plug and Play,Kind of novice working with the inside of a pc stuff but I was able to easily transfer data from one hard drive to another. Simple to use.
4,Worked as expected,Was a life saver when the old computer was damaged in a house fire. Removed the hard drive and plugged it into the port and it was on the desktop ready to copy onto the new computer. Simple easy to use device.Enjoy
1,Not reliable,"Perhaps I just got a bad device or cable, but the connection was flaky out of the box ( I had to hold the cable *just so* to make it work). Now it no longer works at all, even on known good drives."
1,Dangerous Product - Immediately Started Smoking!,"I just received the Sabrent USB-DSC5, connected it to a brand new replacement hard drive and plugged it into the power outlet. I immediately noticed a very distinct smell, and suddenly smoke began coming out of the box connected to the plus. I immediately unplugged everything, and it was still smoking and very hot to the touch.This is a very dangerous product and, in my experience, should not be sold. Especially considering that people using it for its function - transferring data - may leave it unattended and cause a serious fire."
2,Nice while it lasted,"It worked a grand total of three times, then the power supply went dead. I should have read the other reviews here instead of just looking at the average rating of 4.5 stars. Oh well, live and learn.Two stars instead of one, because it actually did work for a bit. Price isn't worth returning it, that's the only plus. :/"
2,Waste of time,"I'm not sure if it's fair to rate a defective product, but I'm still sore over the time I wasted with the Sabrent.I bought this solely to duplicate a failing 320GB WD Scorpio Blue onto a new drive. The fact that it handles IDE -- I still have a couple around -- was gravy. The Sabrent wouldn't get a SATA connection with the Blue so I left the old drive in the laptop and hooked the new HD up instead. The copy process would work for a while, getting slower and slower, and then fail due to an error on the new drive. Came in several mornings hoping for the best and ... nada. Spoke to Sabrent tech support a couple of times, tried their suggestions, and then returned it at their request. At least Amazon makes that part easy.I ended up buying a Cavalry duplicator from Meritline for $45. Not to make this a review of another product, but the Cavalry did its thing in less than two hours with one button press."
5,Great,I needed to connect to my old hard drives. This thing did exactly that. It was easy to figure out too.
4,Problems using the device with IDE CD/DVD drives.,"The unit was bought at Amazon.com. It arrive promptly and in excellent shape.This unit worked trouble free with IDE hard drives. Unfortunately the IDE connector is a bit too large and when inserted in a DVD drive it makes an extremely tight fit with the power plug in case of one drive I tried it with, but in another drive it was overlapping too far so that the power connector could not be inserted at all. You might try a IDE male/female extension cord to solve this problem."
4,Looks can be deceiving,"Bought this product in a bind. PC just died and did not have any other units laying around that could access SATA drives. It definitely saved me, now it is a regular in my arsenal (even with SATA being so prevelant) in back-up and disk management."
5,Works as expected,Worked right out of the box under Windows XP and Windows 7. No drivers or software were necessary. Excellent way to get the data off the drive of a non-functioning computer.
4,Sabrent USB-DSC5,"Sabrent USB-DSC5 Serial ATA or IDE 2.5-/3.5-Inch to USB 2.0 Cable Converter Adapter with Power SupplyThis is a great product if you fully understand what you need it for. It is not a great product for a novice looking for a ""plug and play"" no-brainer answer to an imagined outcome.If you have a decent knowledge of computers in general and are comfortable working within hard drives and other drives, I fully recommend this product. I found the hardware and cables no less fragile than the ones in almost all other computer cases.The USB cable is only 2 feet long, and I wish it were longer than that to give me more room to spread out some, but all-in-all I highly recommend this product to anyone interested in ""benching"" a hard drive and working with it. For the paltry sum of $19.95, it's a great deal, and if you know what you're expecting from it, you won't be disappointed. GOOD PRODUCT."
3,Works ok,"This adapter works ok, but with a 3 1/2 IDE drive (the only type I tried it on) the adapter and the power connector slightly foul each other. This makes it difficult to seat them both."
5,Product worked as I'd hoped,"I hooked up the hard drive to the Sabrent adaptor, plugged it in to the USB port, and Win Explorer allowed me to extract my data from a non-booting drive. No surprises. It just worked!"
5,Great Data recovery tool,"This does exactly what it's supposed to do. Very helpful. I had several old 3.5"" drives from old desktops sitting around from over the years. This made it simple and quick to transfer the data to my laptop.I found the customer reviews very helpful, especially the instructions on how the jumpers should be set for Western Digital drives.Thanks again for making it easy.Highly reccommend this product!"
4,Great for small Laptop drives,"I bought this hardrive adapter for my Aunts Laptop that died. When her Laptopdied, she sent it to me, and we determined the motherboard was dead but not thehardrive. She had lots of Photos, documents, etc. she needed saved so I removedthe hardrive, bought this from Amazon, and made a nice portable drive for her to useon her new computer. Not only did is save her precious pics, and docs, but now shecan use that drive as extra portable storage. She's happy, I'm happy and hopefullyshe doesn't forget about me in the will for saving the day......hehehe"
1,defective power supply!!!!!!!!!!!!!,As with other reviewers I used this thing twice and on the third try the Power Supply Died!!!! Cheaply made Chinese Junk!!!!
4,Neat product,"Great idea. This adapter helps to find uses for old cd/dvd's and harddrives. I have an HP mini and this device gives me the ability to use one of my old internal dvd's as and external for use with the MINI. Also, your old harddrives become useful external usb storage."
3,It works great...if power supply doesn't die,"I've had this item for less than a week before the power supply died.Before the power supply quit, it worked great. I was able to access all of my hard drives with it. I was able to perform drive tests, formats, and backed up files from one drive onto a DVD, which is why I give it three stars. If it had a more reliable power supply, I'd give it 5 stars easily.I read a suggestion from another site that says to be sure to unplug the power supply whenever the drive is not in use, that was not the reason for failure with mine, but maybe it will help others.In any case, I am now awaiting a replacement from Amazon. We'll see if this one lasts any longer."
4,As expected.,"I am very satisfied with this product. It works exactly and described and expected. There is a hang-up on occasion of my XP system not recognizing the hard drive when I connect it using this device, but the hard drives I'm connected to my laptop have sat in a box for a couple years now. It's really no surprise to me. Once I reset my system, connection is typically successful and consistent. On second thought the issue may even lie with my laptop."
5,It just works,"I needed to get all my documents, music, pictures, etc. off a laptop that had died. I popped out the hard drive, plugged everything in. Vista immediately identified the new drive, and I copied over the files I wanted to save. Couldn't be easier.I was looking at other solutions that would have made me plug into the motherboard, etc. No way. This is much easier and could go straight to my new laptop instead of plugging into my desktop.It wasn't the fastest thing in the world, but it just simply worked. No hassles, no errors, no fuss.Great product for a really great price."
4,Good product for IT Tech,"This is a good product for any one who works with computers. Saves me time from opening up and installing a HDD so i can retrieve data. USB is hot swappable, for those who do not know, so you can plug and go. One note: connect then power first then your USB."
5,Awesome,Works perfectly! Affordable and easy way to connect your old hard drive to any computer with a USB port. Mine arrived a day after ordering and I was able to retrieve all the files from my old drive.
4,Handy Kit,"Handy collection of cables and connectors that allowed me to salvage data off a 2.5"" hard drive. Instructions are sparse."
5,buy it,Our computer died. I pulled the hard drive out of it and used this thing to connect it to our new computer to get some files off of it. I was worried because this thing was cheaper than the other stuff for sale. not worried now this is a good product. hellah simple to use effectively and it comes in a nice box. Paid $3 for shipping from tiger direct and it was on my front porch 3 days later.
1,pretty cheap,"This item was useless. The plastic plug for the hard drive was not manufactured properly. Some of the pin holes were still closed with the plastic from the manufacturing of the item. I carefully tried to open the pin holes with a needle, but the plug never worked. The pins of my hard drive would not go in and were bent which ruined the hard drive. Very cheaply made low quality."
2,Power Supply Died Right Out Of The Box,"I will have to say it works quite well. However, the power supply died the first time I used it. Looking around at other reviews I have found that this is a common and frequently occurring problem. If you plan on using this as a stand-alone product, go elsewhere unless you have a spare power supply to donate to the cause. Other than that, the product works great. Just trash the power supply and get another one."
1,Corrupts target files,"Bought from Amazon 4 months ago. Found this week that almost every copying of files 3 GB corrupted 2-4 bytes in target files. First encountered this issue while using Acronis for files 90-50 GB. Checked also with fc f1 f2 /b. Tried to put the contacts far from electrical cables and SystemPages tweak. Didn't help.As soon as HDD was placed into enclosure (Acomdata Samba is pretty solid, bought it from Amazon 2 years ago) files copied OK.Can't be sure in quality of smaller copied files.This device seems unfit for files transfer."
5,Sabrent USB 2.0 to SATA/IDE Adapter,"This worked very well with a 40GB laptop IDE hard drive (sister-in-law's dead laptop). Plugged drive into the USB adaptor, connected the power adapter, then plugged into my computer (Vista 64-bit). Windows detected it and I was able to backup the files from the laptop drive to my computer. The price was reasonable, contains all of the cables I would need if I were a novice needing to do it for myself. I will be putting it to good use in the very near future for other family members I'm sure!"
5,Everyone who knows how to swap out a drive needs one!!,I am a drive killer - sometimes an operating system killer. This has been a life saver for me. When your other hardware fails a kit like this is often the only way to recover files from a hard drive. It's been absolutely invaluable.UPDATE 1 YEAR LATERThis cable hasn't seen a lot of use in the past 6 months but when I tried to connect to 4 different drives last night none of them would mount. I can't imagine that all 4 of these drives died at the same time and I don't have a a 2nd computer to try it from but I suspect it's the connector that has died. Kinda bummed cause I needed to do some backups. I just ended up using Dropbox online backup in the interim.
4,Works well but needs instructions.,"This kit is good, but different IDE hard drives, DVD and CD drives are labeled less well than this equipment. As such, the overall user experience would benefit from instructions and advice on how to connect to unlabeled or incorrectly labeled equipment.I had an old internal Pioneer DVD-R drive with an unoriented molex connector. I attached the connector in the wrong polarity and the drive slowly started smoking and burned out; a total loss. Be certain to understand your equipment's eccentricities before making all final connections.However, this connector did help me successfully copy info off of the 4 other IDE internal hard drives, taken from old computers going back to 1997. I was able to move all the data to a new external terabyte drive and reformat all the old IDE drives with the latest Mac HFS+ file system."
4,time saver of the month,"I am very happy that i purchased this HDD adapter. it saves me butt loads of time when im working on my friends' computers. Since you are looking at this product, you are probably ""that guy"" everyone turns to when they break something, like myself. Not only does this device save me time, but also saves me from dismantling my computer to plug in an extra hard drive, and risking shorting out a component or breaking anything off."
5,Freaking AWESOME!,"I use this with my laptop to read from some older SATA and IDE drives. It worked flawlessly. I had some 250GB SATA drives and an 80GB IDE drive in a computer with a dead mobo. I've since bought a laptop and so didn't want to repair the old one, but I wanted the data on the drives. I hooked them up and they worked without a hitch without installing ANY DRIVERS! And, especially for the price, I can't recommend this product enough. VERY NICE!!!"
1,Looks good. Doesn't work!,"I really needed and looked forward to using this product. There is no CD as is mentioned in reviews. It's easy to assemble and attach. It just doesn't work and do what it says it will do. Motor activates but does not do anything. I used it with a Western Digital SATA 250GB WD2500JB (Caviar SE)internal drive. Inadequate and minimal ""instructions"" state to make sure drive is set to Master. Both drives are the same. I researched settings and found evidence that this apparatus will work in the normal configuration as my drives are configured - no jumper strips. It does nothing and just sits there.I read other reviews that are ecstatic about the product and several that say the motors on many are inadequate or defective. I am EXTREMELY dissatisfied with the Sabrent 5 in 1 and find their website lacking in any help, drivers and information.Good luck to all who hope this is a wonder. To me it is a complete and utter DUD."
2,Needs more documentation,The converter needs better and more documentation. The converter doesn't work with Windows 7 64bit OS. The converter didn't help me transfer files at all.
3,good for what it does,"I was under the impression I was getting connectors for any kind of hard drive. Turns out mine's ATA/100. Oh well.Seems to work well with SATA and IDE drives, though."
1,Defective,"+ Nice fit and finish, accessory cables etc.- Did not work with any of my 3.5 inch ATA hard drivesPerhaps this was a single bad apple? I returned it."
4,USB to Hard Drive adapter it just works,"Works flawlessly as advertised with both my PC and my MACS - great little lifesaver when the ports on external drives or the internal boards on externals bite the dust. Just remove drive from enclosure and if the drive is not fried. Hook up adapter, apply power and your good to go. I also use it to back up data to old drives from PC's that I have scrapped."
2,Not worth the risk,"I went cheap and it was cheap. It comes in several pieces that are easy to misplace, some parts are hard to connect to the drives. It overheats drives and in one case caused one drive to stop working. I sent it back and spent an extra $10 for a much better adapter."
3,Works well,"If you are looking for a no frills hookup of various Hard Drives to your computer this works well. My primary purpose of utilizing this product was to hook up hard drives to wipe for various folks prior to disposal. I do not think I would like this product for a permanent HD hookup due to its lack of casing. Because there is no casing, there is no muffling of the HD so some drives are VERY NOISY. The only other gotcha with this hookup is that you sometimes have to fiddle with the HD jumper settings to get the drive recognized, mostly likes when the HD is set to primary via jumpers rather than cable select..."
1,Be careful using it !,"Purchased this adapter so I could load information on a new SATA drive before installing in the laptop.NO instructions come with the adapter, but use SEEMS very straight forward... plugs only go in one way.Literally, SMOKE came out of the drive when I plugged it in (and an awful smell of something burning). Either the adapter is defective or I should have only used one of the cables...no way to know, but I'm pretty certain that the brand-new drive was good. Had to get a NEW drive, as this one was damaged by using the adapter.Not blaming anyone, just WARNING anyone trying this product to get DOCUMENTATION before using it...NO useful information comes with the unit.Find out WHICH plug to use, where power goes (which pin, etc)...Haven't heard of this kind of problem from others reading reviews, but I'm certain I couldn't have been the only one.Good luck !"
2,The IDE socket is too big. It makes it impossible to plug in both power and IDE,"I have high hope for this product but it has a very large flaw. If your IDE socket area is very close to your power plug area, this won't work for you. The IDE plug is too big. I can either plug in the IDE or the power, not both.I will have to find an IDE cable to see if I can extend this out a bit. Poor design."
5,Time Saver,When windows decides to crap the bed and the OS needs to be re-installed this device makes transferring files from a client's drive to a back-up drive a heck of a lot easier than having to crack the case of another computer and slave out the drive. Fast transfer rate too. 480mbps
4,It works...,"Well, it works as per description...Connector is a bit flimsy, butif you are being careful with it - it does work..."
5,USB Drive Cables,Works fine if you know what you are doing. It doesn't figure things out for you though.
4,Works great,"The directions were a little sketchy on how to plug it up, but it works great. Wish it had a smaller power supply so it was easier to carry in my laptop bag. Definitely glad I bought it."
5,"Works great, no problems.",I tried it on assortment of disk drives that I have and it worked great with all of them. I didn't have a single problem.
5,worked without a flaw,I was looking for this device for a while. I was tring to transfer some old file from old hard drive and it worked perfectly!!!
5,Great Product,"Hard drive on my Macbook Pro crashed. Took computer to Apple store and they could not recover what was on my hard drive. They recommended two separate data recovery services for some important files that I wanted recovered. The services were going to cost between $700 and $3500 to recover the data from my crashed hard drive.I bought this cable on the outside chance that it would be able to read the drive. It worked!!! Even though the Mac itself could not mount or repair the drive when it was installed internally, when I attached it to this cable, I was able to recover files. It was slow, but I believe that was because my hard drive was truly corrupt, and maybe this device does more retries than the internal OS?In any case, very happy that a $25 purchase saved me upwards of thousands $$$."
1,Truly awful product.,"I got 2-3 uses out of it. Intention when I bought this was simply to use for wiping drives. It worked fine on the first couple of drives (SATA). Now when I plug the USB cable in only the blue light appears. Depending on if I have an IDE or SATA drive attached, the white light for either of those blinks very briefly and the drive does not appear. I've tried this on 4 different computers running Windows 7, Windows XP and booting from a DOS CD. This is a really bad product."
1,very disappointed,"Sabrent USB-DSC5 Serial ATA or IDE 2.5-/3.5-Inch to USB 2.0 Cable Converter Adapter with Power Supply it didn't work,so i trashed it,i'm done buying junk online."
1,Real Junk,Mine had a short inside and made the entire attempt to mirror a nightmare. A Apricorn EasyGig II case and mirroring software was purchased and the process was a breeze.
4,Life saver that's crude but effective.,This gadget saved my sanity after my computer mother board got fried in a lightning storm. My external backup drive got fried at the same time.The adapter is rather crudely made (the IDE connector was poorly keyed and allowed it to be plugged in off center) but who cares when it eventually salvages a year or more of your work.
2,I wish it worked,"This adaptor said that it works with ALL 2.5"" or 3.5"" SATA or IDE hard drives so I felt pretty comfortable in purchasing it. Well, it does NOT work with my 2.5"" SATA Fujuitsu drive. My drive is not bootable so I was hoping to be able to hook it up to my desktop and get some files off of it. I waited a week and a half for this adaptor to arrive and the cables won't even connect. Am I missing something?? I know HOW it's SUPPOSED to connect, but the Fujuitsu drive seems to have a plastic piece blocking part of the area the adaptor's SATA connector is supposed to go. There is NO way to remove this piece from the hard drive. (sigh) Anyway, I gave this adaptor two stars. It MAY work for some, but this USB adaptor does NOT work with ALL the drives it claims it does. To top it off, Sabrent's website is useless. I am quite disappointed."
5,Works as advertised,"When the processor in my desktop died, I bought this to try to recover the data from a hard drive. It worked. It worked on the 3.5"" SATA drive I wanted to recover, and it has since worked on a 3.5"" IDE from a long dead desktop. The instructions are not detailed (to say the least), but with a little bit of time spent looking at the options (how to connect the USB adapter to the drive, and how to connect the power supply to the drive), it's pretty obvious how to use it. In the case of 3.5"" drives, you do have to connect the drive to the adapter, and the power to the drive, before you connect the adapter to the computer's USB port.As stated in the other reviews, don't plan to use this to create a long term USB drive, it just isn't made to withstand abuse. But for a temporary recovery or data transfer solution, it's perfect.This neat little $20 device saved me an immense amount of trouble, and it worked the first time. If I only use it once, it was well worth the money."
1,Broke after 3 uses,Worked great until the third hard drive.It broke all the power pins off of the drive and when i pulled them out of the power cable it took out the metal sheathing from the power adapter.Now I use it as a paper weight.CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP
1,Complete Junk,"Total and complete junk. Tried 5 hard drives, 3 SATA and 2 IDE. All got ""Device Malfunctioned"" from windows and could not be read. This thing is a total PoC and is getting returned."
3,HELP... I'M COMFSED??? USB to SATA,"Can I Use Sabrent USB-DSC5 Serial ATA or IDE 2.5-/3.5-Inch to USB 2.0 for plugging my old HP PC Pentium 4 comes with USB 2.0, plugging into a SATA Seagate Barracuda 7200.12 1TB Hard Drive (OEM) as a Slave Drive. Not sure to buy this SATA HDD first or wait untill someone knows for sure. I don't want it to be a waste of my money."
1,Do I smell burning circuits?,"I bought this because I am opening a computer service center. I thought it would be a vital tool, and it would if it had worked.I read the instructions and plugged it to a 250 GB hard drive that I would have liked to use again. But,alas, as black smoke rolled of the power connector like an scene from mission impossible, I had to decide whether to let the combustion process continue, or risk electrocution to disconnect it. Being the genius I am, I chose the later and was unharmed, unlike my poor data laden, smoldering hard drive.From now on I plan to read further into reviews and not just look at the cumulative stars. For if I had, I would see that many others have had the very same incendiary experience. I plan to seek legal counsel in the matter, just getting my money back is not going to cut it."
1,Totally useless product,This product is totally useless. The first day i opened this up and plug it in it caused my harddrive to burst into flames. It worked for 8 secs then literally burst into flames destroying all my data. Worst product I've ever bought from amazon.
2,works erratically and hard to connect,"the price is right, but it juest doesnt work all the time. Same cabling on drive and different results. VERY sensitive about order in which cables are connected (usb, ide/sata, power to drive). I am in the business and this was still a PITA to test some drives on. Known good drives wouldnt attach at all. Would recommend for a cheap stationary solution. its not going to be reliable like a Mybook if you are swapping out different disks unfortunately. power cable adapters needed lots of maneuvering to get into connector. I would love to pay double and actually get one of these things that works reliably"
5,Works Great,"I've owned laptop unpowered cases before but my computers always recognized them as mass storage devices and not hard drives, making it difficult to clone hard drives for upgrades using Acronis True Image. This however works great for that purpose. It was plug it in and no problems, very simple to use."
1,Fried my hard drive,"Lost the 120gb hard drive IDE 3.5"" i wanted to copy. One of the components on the board turned white hot and melted.Pretty sad. Not sure what I did wrong. I connected USB first and then plugged it into the HDD. Probably stupid, but not ""fry my hard drive full of stuff I wanted"" stupid."
4,Most often used item in my tech bag,This hard drive adapter is the best. I have tried several different makes from other manufactures and this by far is the most compatible requiring no drivers. It even works on Mac's. You can use it to boot up any Intel based Mac if you have a working system on the drive it's connected to. Only problem I have had with this adapter is the first one came with a DOA power supply. But Amazon's return / refund process was so simple that it did not bother me and I had a replacement unit in 3 days without it costing me a cent. Transfer speeds are good and depend more on the drive that is connected to it and the system you are connecting too.
5,Great hard drive cable,The cable shipped fast. I had 2 hard drives from an old computer that I needed to retrieve data from. I only had to move the jumper on one of the drive pins to the master position and the interface worked flawlessly. Great product.
2,Disapointed,I was exited when I got this product. However I was disappointed when the power adaptor did not work. I had to return it for a replacement. The replacement worked fine and got the job done. I was just annoyed that I had to wait until got the replacement to transfer my data from my old drive.
5,"Macbook pro crashed, this little cheap-toyish looking saved the day! Works Awesome!!","It works pretty well. Comes with all cables, power connectors a power adapter so that you can not only access hard drives but also CD/DVD drives etc.Very very useful. I recommend it.Looks like crap and cheap, but it works great. The transfer speed was also very fast, just like USB 2.0 external hard drives.Great Stuff!"
5,Exactly what I needed,"I purchased this product to recover data from two computers I own. The oldest computer is about 15 years old, and the OS died. I bought the second computer to replace it, and that one was replaced because the hard drive had errors. Using this device I was able to retrieve ALL of the information from both hard drives - files I had thought lost forever. The process was simple and quick. I am very happy with the purchase."
1,Very Dangerous Device,I bought this 3 in 1 cable yesterday and hooked it up to a SATA drive I was trying to remove data from and the adapter fried my drive instantly. This is a very dangerous product and i don't recommend it to anyone.
3,Sabrent USB to SATA/IDE,"This is a product with an interesting and very flexible design. One can change between SATA, IDE, 2.5, 3.5instantaneously. Unfortunately, Sabrent supplies it with a very unreliable AC power supply and apparently, they know it. My power supply was DOA, no light, no spin-up. As soon as I told them my problem, they sent a good replacement. However, the power supply is not needed for the 2.5 drives. Sarbent is one of those rare companies with competent technical ""assistance!""Sabrent USB-DSC5 Serial ATA or IDE 2.5-/3.5-Inch to USB 2.0 Cable Converter Adapter with Power SupplyThere is one design fault, unlike ordinary ribbon cable, it is quite easy to plug a 3.5 in incorrectly. A further problem is Micro Soft disk formatting, both the Windows 7 and XP give unstable results, Seagate's formatting program is stable (what's new?). I got this for older drives, I have not tested it for SATA."
5,Easy to use: don't hesitate,"This thing may not win in the looks department, but it is reliable and painfully simple to use. Do not be discouraged by some other reviewers- I have no idea how anyone could build their own PC from the ground up and be defeated by this kit.The instructions are a bit sparse, so here's a quick walkthrough:1) Plug kit into PC via USB2) Attach drive (this includes power!)3) Reboot computer4) Access drive!Dead simple. I've used this on SATA, IDE, and a few old skool laptop drives of mine and have been very pleased with the results."
1,Destroys Hard Drives,"This device destroyed my hard drive. The failure seems to be with a faulty power adapter. Ensure that you backup your data before plugging your drive into this device, otherwise look for another adapter. This one is too risky (others have had the same problem)."
1,Smoked two IDE Drives,"Bought two, returning both. First attempt caused smoke from my client's hard drive. Dug out another drive to test with and it smoked too. BEWARE!"
5,as advertised,it worked exactly like the product description said it would. couldn't have been easier.
5,does what I need it to do,"So far, so good. It does what I need it to do.It lets me access spare drives, or access drives from computers that won't boot to Windows, so that I can boot into Linux and backup the important files.It doesn't look pretty, but I don't need it to.It's somewhat of a mess of cables, and it's not some sleek dock or something, but again, it works. And I don't need it to be pretty. I use it, what, maybe once every couple months?Highly recommended for fixing computers, not for regular day to day use."
4,Good,"I've used it for the past two months, works well so far. All my IDE hard disks work with it. Would be better if it has a power switch to turn on/off."
4,nice tool,i gave this product 4 stars coz i hav'nt tried it on sata drives. but this product works great on ide's. just make sure you got the right jumper setting (works perfect on master) tested on ide cdrom/dvdrom/hardrives. it should work with sata. great for data recovery jobs!
4,It gets the job done,"Needed to retrieve data from a SATA HDD from a toasted PC and worked swiftly. No hassle. Please keep in mind this is a rescue solution. I you want to recycle an internal HDD to external backup/storage unit, I recommend:Rosewill RX358 RX-358-U3S Full Aluminum Cover, metal tray 3.5"" Silver (or Black) USB 3.0 External Enclosure for SATA Hard Drive Use [notice I recommended a USB 3.0 device since it provides better transfer rates]"
1,Bleh should have read more reviews,"Had a lot of great reviews, so I went ahead and bought it. As soon as i connected it i saw smoke like a previous person did as well. Drive is now dead. I'm not totally sure if i want to go through the hassle of getting a new one or not. I am glad i have quite a bit on backup, but unfortuneatly not everything.If you are going to use it, make sure everything of any importance to you is backed up on cd/flash drive."
2,Worked for two days,"I use one of these at work, different brand, on a regular basis. I wanted one for home use and order this one. Product worked as expected TWICE. The third time I plugged in the AC adapter it failed to light up that it was getting power. I swapped out the 3 prong AC cord and tried other wall sockets. Absolutely pathetic quality on the AC adapter."
4,Solid Product,"The cables worked as promised and helped me upgrade to a much larger drive with the help of Acronis. The reason I did not give it 5 stars is mainly due to the lack of instructions. Still once you figure out how it works, everything worked like a charm."
4,Silver is a great live album,"Having not been a fan of live albums this one is an exception.Cheap Trick put together a 2 cd album from their tours.Although in their 50's they still sound good.Rick insists on telling the audience that Robin sounds better singing.This album brings both John Bryant and its nice to hear Tom Peterson playing his 12 string bass.Over all the hits are here from surrender to Dream Police.They even threw in Woke Up With A Monster in there.The one balad that gave me goose bumps was called Time Will Let You Know.The ending chorus was lifting.There are a few tracks that I skipped just because I never really cared for them anyway.Gonna Raise Hell off the Dream Police album,Woke up with a Monster and the dreadfull version of I'm Losing You. Robin let John Lennon handle that one friend no ofense.Over all Cheap Trick fans won't be disapointed.Just remember its not Live at Budakan and you'll be alright."
2,cheap trick - cheap guitar playing,"First of all, I love Ct. Tom Peterson has always been one of my favorite bass players. That 12 string bass on Gonna Raise Hell is just awesome. I consider myself a die-hard CT fan, but the recording on this cd is really bad at times, not to mention Rick's guitar playing. I couldn't believe the guitar solo at the end of She's Tight. Awful to say the least. His overall guitar playing is really bad. Listen to Budakon, the guitar playing is almost flawless compared to Silver. Even the recording quality on Budakon is better. I've noticed that at live performances as well. The last few times I've seen CT, Rick's Guitar playing was terrible. I own almost every CT cd, but I must say, this one is at the bottom of the list."
4,Elo Trick Fans!!!,"Cheap Trick has been my favorite band since 1978. This latest live CD called ""Silver"" reflects the band exactly as I've always known them to be...melodic, brash, & a little reckless. ""Silver"" has a very diverse song selection which includes many cuts you won't usually hear in CT's live sets. Excellent versions of ""Oh Candy"", ""I Know What I Want"", ""You're All Talk"", ""Stop This Game"", ""Just Got Back"", ""She's Tight"" & ""Woke Up With A Monster"" represent the disc's harder rockin' moments. There are some nice ballads, especially ""Time Will Let You Know"". On the downside, like a lot of concerts featuring special guests the playing & the mix on Silver are a little sloppy at times but overall it's a nice editon to the growing body of Cheap Trick's live recordings."
2,There is a surprize here!,"Every track on here is LIVE. There is not one studio recording on the whole set. I don't see anything on the cover saying so. I almost NEVER buy live recordings so I'm just a bit ticked right now. If it had been all album versions this would have been an awsome collection of thier best work IMHO. If you want a huge comprehensive collection of thier songs live, here it is. I now realize the one I was looking for was ""Cheap Trick, The Hits"" released in 2002."
2,"Great music, poor recording","Scott Joplin was a master, his music depicts the 20's era wonderfully. I was sadly disappointed, however, with this collection. The recording is obviously modern (I could give it grace if it was an old recording) and the microphone was evidently not modulated enough, there is an annoying fuzzy sound whenever the piano gets at all too loud. Also there are artificial echo/twang-reverb effects that are just barely noticeable, and no doubt intended to compliment the style, but it comes off feeling more like it's approaching canned music.The music itself, while brilliant, is very repetitive in style. Be prepared to listen hard to be able to distinguish one song from another."
1,aptly named,kevin bacon voice was dubbed and their was no plot what a waste of time and money do not buy
1,The Demise of Kevin Bacon,"I was sorely disappointed in this film. The plot was dodgy and I actually had to watch it in two segments because I couldn't will myself to sit through the whole thing in one shot. Kevin Bacon's horrible British accent and poor acting really makes me re-evaluate him as an actor. The whole premise of the film was predictable and the violence and action scenes were never fluid or purposeful. The main character of the story, Church, manages to evade bullets and when he does, he heals magically and is ready for combat by the next day. The only reason I would watch the movie is for the cool guns. Otherwise it was a giant waste of time."
2,"Confusing story, bad acting, hammy accents... C- at best","Seriously boring flic... About 15 mins in, you cease to care about anything whatsoever... save your money and more importantly save your time and give this old clunker a wide berth..."
2,"B movie, bad acting","VThe main actor in this movie is Djimon Hounsou, not Kevin Bacon. Djimon Hounsou isn't the most versatile actor, and the producers probably failed to notice that. Kevin Bacon's accent seems like a joke in this movie.Djimon's character is always out trying to get new guns, and threatens to shoot if he doesn't get his guns and does it in a very unconvincing way everytime. The fighting/shooting choreography was horrible, so even if you're looking for an action movie and don't care about the storyline this would still be disappointing."
4,The Windsors Under Glass,"Based on research done for a TV documentary of the same name, this book covers the same ground that Elizabeth Longford's ""The Royal House of Windsor"" does but with a more objective than personal view. This is to be expected because neither author shares the intimacy with the Royal Circle that Lady Longford does. As a result this book focuses more on the historical events that swirled around the Royals than on the personalities of the Royals; yet by their actions, the book still tells a lot about them as individuals.Both books should be read if you want to make sense of current events in the House of Windsor. Read Elizabeth Longford's book first, and this book second. Both sets of authors conclude that the House of Windsor will survive. That is to be expected of a dedicated royalist such as Longford. That Brendon and Whitehead came to the same conclusion appeared more to be a lack of nerve in the end than of reasoned conviction."
4,Great Deal,I have one Kenwood in this box and hits perfectly! This is the best deal I could find on a box and I am confident that I made the right choice.
4,She thought she knew it all,"This is a great little book for any young miss who hates for you to talk to her about manners. The catchy drawings, hiliarous names and 'girl-chat' manner in which the material is presented makes it fun to read ;the letters and questions from real girls give it a personal feel. The manners quizzes are fun and will definitely let you know if your young miss does,indeed, know it all. This is Emily Post and Miss Manners with a sense of humor.It is well worth the price and a welcome addition to my child's growing library."
4,easy for girls to understand,This book was picked up and read eagerly by my 15 year old. The only thing I don't like was the page on nosey questions asking about suicide. I have a 7 year old who is starting to read everything and I wouldn't want to have to explain suicide at this age! Otherwise a very good book.
2,"Pretty, but Useless !!","We purchased this complete set since has a very attractive and colorful pattern. Unfortunately, the set suffers in two huge respects. First, the sizes of plates, bowls, etc., are out of the ordinary. The plates are either too small, or too large and heavy. Older folks will have problems picking up the large dinner plate. Second, and more importantly, this collection is totally unmicrowaveable. No, they will not break, but they will heat up to above boiling temperature and immediately blister your skin if touched. If you need a dinner set that goes into the microwave, this certainly is not it.Overall, I give the set a 9 on looks, a 5 on usefulness, and a 2 on microwave compatibility. Please check this set out in person at a local store to evaluate for yourself before ordering just from pictures."
1,More mold please,I have the napoli set and they are...VERY POORLY MADE!DO NOT BUY!The bottom of these dishes aren't sealed so if they aren't completely dry they will begin to gather mold and smell. Had to throw these out after a year of use because of this.
2,pretty meh,This album is as boring as H.P. lovecraft's short stories. Zenophobia and Better not Born being the two songs I consider worth a listen.
5,Lovecraft meets punk,"The first time I ever heard this album,back around 1990,I thought 'What the hell is this?', then it grew on me like an evil green fungus.Every song on this album has to do with H.P. Lovecraft,who wrote really twisted science fiction/horror stories. These aren't really songs as much as they are snippets from the life of Lovecraft.From his living situation,his aunt's attic,to the subject of his stories this album covers it all.If you love bass heavy punk and Lovecraft then this album is for you."
1,Oh My,"I cannont people have the audacity to rate this movie with full stars!! The only good thing this movie is good for is pure hysterical boredom. If you're a fan of really, REALLY bad acting... this is the movie for you. I have watched it about 5 times,usually while feeling irie, because it is simply made for laughter. The best part is when that redhead is caught puking in the bathroom, oh my goodness...can someone please HELP that pathetic woman?Truthfully, one of my favorite movies of all time, simply because it's so terrible that I can't believe it's real."
4,A fine book on a fine National Park,"Some of my favorite trails in WA--glaciers, high ridges, waterfalls, flowers--a must for exploring the park."
1,Out of Date Book.....,"This is an out of date book. If Michael Minbiole is an engineering legend at Northwestern, he should be able to write a book that you can use. The text does a very poor job in providing information on modeling, assembly, and drawings with SolidWorks.There are some good screen captures and sample drawing information. I expected a lot more. NOT HAPPY WITH THE BOOK."
2,Old Man,This book was written for an older version of SolidWorks than the one I have. It was not much help to me.
3,One Good; One Average,"The original Soccer Dog movie is very good for kids, at least my kids (ages 6 and 10) loved it. The Soccer Dog European Cup is ok (kids still liked it), but less good because (1) Scottish accents make it hard for kids to understand parts and (2) soccer action is less believable (because adults are playing, not kids), so older kids (8 yrs & up) will find it more fake."
4,Master Filmaker at Work,"New Bedford is in Massachusetts, not Connecticut but why carp....John Huston,s ""Moby Dick"" is worth the viewing. Anyone who would dare to bring this great novel to the screen is certainly to be applauded. All the nuances of Mellville,s saga is almost impossible to depict. John Huston stamps his signature on this wonderfull film with his subtle framing of scenes and , with Oswald Morris, a mix of color and sepia that is ""real"" for the period. Richard Basehart does a nice job of narration and I must confess that I might watch the film just for seeing Orson Welles deliver that sermon as Father Mapple..it,s pure Welles. Finally, There will be other filmakers that might try their hand at this drama..I dare say that this film is their benchmark...!!"
5,Excellent :),"I love this older version much better then the Halmark remake. The sea, the ships, the way everyone carried themselves made you actually think you were there =)Gregory Peck plays Cptn Ahab so good I now couldnt picture Ahab as being depict by anyone else!"
4,Moby Dick my review,"Moby Dick is a great book, The movie version is good. Gregory Peck may not have been right for Captain Ahab,but was good enough to show the revenge maddend whaler as the villan of the film. The cast does a good job, Ishmael and Quequeg were well played. The special effecects were good its easy topull for Moby Dick over Ahab. Moby Dick is great look at not only whaling but obsession, hate, and the grim stuggle whalers faced at sea."
4,Call me Ishmael...,"My only objection to this film is that when I read the book I hear Gregory Peck's voice! Despite the advances in special effects that might diminish this work in the eyes of the video generation I found this to be a masterwork, especially the film coloration that served as a ""background wash"" for Ahab's hard-edged reality. Orson Welles' portrayal of Father Mapple is worth the price of admission in and of itself. Visually, this is a magnificent film. A must for coffee drinkers who wonder who Starbuck's coffee is named for..."
2,Widescreen version needed,I have this version I bought some time ago not realizing it was the crappy fullscreen format that crops off much of a movie shot in widescreen. Great movie but too bad we only see a portion of what was photographed.
3,A very dated movie . . .,"The movie pales before modern movies with special effects like 'Into the Wild'. It is severe and dark and their are no light moments as in the book. Gregory Peck, even in wrath, is too suave and amiable a man for Captain Ahab. Movie needs to be remade."
2,Boring!!!!!!!!,"This movie is very boring and is not very good. While watching this shameless movie, I fell asleep. It is about Ahab and his obsession with a white whale (Moby Dick). If you are looking for action this is not for you. It gets somewhat suspenseful in the last half-hour. However, I do not recommend it to anyone!!"
4,Classic movie worth being in your video library,"This is a classic movie worth being in any video library. Although whaling is now taboo, it was an honest and respected way of living for it's time and a very dangerous one for the sailors who engaged in it."
4,Good Movie,"Check-out was easy. Shipping was fast. Emailed confirmations for payment & shipping. Only negative...case was delivered with cut in it. However, the disk was unharmed and played fine."
4,The Movie Drags In Spots,MOBY DICK was obviously a very good movie which presented a difficult challenge for director John Huston. I definitely would have cast some other actor in the role of the crazed Captain Ahab. Even Edward G. Robinson would have been a better choice. The action scenes were better than average and the whale was probably superior by the standards for special effects in 1956.Ray Bradbury helped Huston with the script.My main complaint is that the movie drags in spots.
1,Won't play on my DVD.,Although this movie was one of my favorites while I was growing up. I am rather put off by the fact that it just won't play on my DVD.
3,a well done classic movie in color,"Historically the novel Moby Dick was a serialthat was as popular for teaching whaling as for the story.In the 19th century several species were hunted to extinction or near it by North Americans:buffalo, passenger pigeons, California brown bears and several species of whaleson the high seas.In this book Captain Ahab for Melville describes the migrationpatterns of whales which made the extinctions easier.The literary aspects of Moby Dick are well known as it is required reading in many American high schools.I think that Richard Basehart may have been a little old to play Ishmael,but overall the movies is well written and well acted.Anyone remaking this classic will have to deal withthe beauty of this script."
2,More Huston than Melville.,"More a lean Hemingway adventure than Melville's mad encyclopaedia - and even more a typical Huston fable about men and failure. Ahab the maimed tries to recover wholeness by destroying his destroyer, a non-starter of an idea. It needed someone with a less cautious imagination to make this, someone who didn't care so much about plot, who could plumb the depths, soar the heights, the rites, the lunatic, magical, incantatory pagan/religious/philosophical mish mash. Only the eerie scene of Queequig's decision to die even comes close. The whaling sequences are the best, full of a real, almost documentary danger that brings the film nearer to Herzog. Herzog doing 'Moby Dick'? Now there's a thought...Kinski as Ahab...mmm."
5,a classic!,"They don't make flicks like this anymore! Fantastic character development, acting and cinematography. Sorry that some of the nuances (and scenes) of the book are absent. The depth of symbolism is not realized in the film (as in the book). Still, it's so well-done that it is not missed. Highly recommend!"
2,Moby Dick DVD,"You are never too old to learn something new. I was not aware there were DVD regions - this one was Region 2 - for Europe. It would not run on either of my DVD players (a Sony and a Toshiba), but it did run using my computer.Except for the region issue, everything else was great. I enjoyed the movie, the delivery came as promised, but I don't think I will be buying any more European DVDs."
4,John Huston does himself & Melville proud,"Huston, although necessarily simplifying the complexities of the book, Moby Dick, was faithful to the characters, their dialogue and the plot line. Huston also displayed the dangers of the charismatic leader whose obsessions can doom his followers, perhaps a warning to Americans given the politics of the fifties when the movie was released."
2,"Great movie, false advertising","One of the truly great movies by John Huston and the first to give you a real feel for the old wooden ships of the era not equaled until Master and Commander by Peter Weir. Unfortunately Amazon falsely advertised this disk as a wide screen 1:78 ratio presentation. It is instead a 1:33 ratio, pan and scan with relatively poor video quality. At the moment it is the only disk of this film available.Moby Dick"
4,MOBY DICK Fascinates Live-in Toddler,Three-year-old daughter loves to be read to from MOBY DICK. We have several versions of the story in film version. She'd give this one 3 stars. I'll give it 4.
4,Good Movie,Great movie and decent quality. not much more to say. Amazon makes viewing movies easy as pie. Just as good as Netflix.
2,Movie's great- roku delivery faltered in the middle for no reason,"Never had a movie gum up the amazon-roku system like this one. Had to hard boot everything. If technological problems were fixed, movie itself would be a 4+."
5,"One of the best film adaptations of fine literature, and best films, in my extensive viewing history","Convincing and compelling on many levels. Both the acting and special effects relating to the seafaring and whale chases are superb, 1956 standards surpassing 2012's. True to the flavor of Melville's magnum opus."
5,Fantasic,"As a boy I hear this did not win an academy award because it was not an American produced film. I expect it would have been nominated if it was. Gregory Pecks performance was honored in it's remake with Patrick Stewart. Although I consider Stewart a very good actor, he got beat on this one."
3,"Nice, but no cool special effects.",It was a very interesting but not very unbelieveable. The book was much better than the movie. It was neat to the point that it showed good and evil. It was groovy dude!
4,puts1 Corinthians into a framework for understanding,"Although I haven't read many commentaries as of yet, this one increased my understanding of 1 Corinthians greatly, especially in regards to what was going on at Corinth and how Paul was reacting to it. Although sometimes I felt really bogged down in details, I know they were important."
4,A classic...religious in the best sense,"Arthur Gordon writes great stories. However, realistic but inspirational insight into the joys we often miss will enrich the reader's life. I have probably bought and given away a dozen copiers of A TOUCH OF WONDER since it was first given to me."
4,pretty good for the money...,"It's a really cute backpack, and the ipod function is pretty slick.. although after a semester of heavy use (college=lots and lots of walking) Some of the edges of the fabric are kind of fraying... not coming apart fraying, like some of the synthetic fibers stick out form the fabric. Zippers hold up better than any of my 3 jansports.. including 2 airlift backpacks that retail around 70-100 dollars! Definitely worth what I paid for it!"
3,This rocks,"Diamond Head rocks pretty hard. They are to Motorhead what the Faces are to the Stones - better lead singer, not quite as good, but still really good. Standout tracks include Am I Evil and Shoot out the Lights.You can definetely hear their influence on Metallica. This is what heavy metal should be."
3,I DON'T GET IT...,"I got this cd because i heard it was a major influence to bands like metallica and megadeth, i though i would be getting some kick @$$ nwobhm metal in the vain of saxon, iron maiden or motorhead or even venom. instead what i got was a band thats sounds a little too much like thin lizzy. i don't get how these guys were so influential, don't get me wrong, i like their music, i thought the cd was pretty good strait forward 70's rock n roll, but thats it. this isn't ""heavy"" at all, this is comparable to most 70's areana rock. i write this as a warning so others wont be fooled like i have THIS ISN'T METAL AT ALL! this is just an average late 70's rock band, christ, aerosmith has put-out heavier music then this."
4,Don Patterson review,"I owned this in an LP form some time ago. I enjoyed it then and find it a pleasure to listen to again after all these years. One of my favorite tracks is ""The Good Life"" - a good slow groovy version - for true organ lovers. And ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home"" is a real up tempo smoker! All of the music sounds as good now as it did many years ago!"
5,Fascinating Frontier Tale,"This book is, as I stated in the title, FASCINATING! It is the story of a frontier rifleman's son and it is soooo realistic. You will lose yourself in this book and feel like you are the main character. There are wonderful illustrations and it is written in a way that is easy to read. You just flow from one chapter to the next."
2,There are better books out there,"If you're looking for a fast, shallow treatment of Cuban history, written by a largely uncritical supporter of the Cuban Revolution, then look no further, you've found it.I've read Hugh Thomas' book ""Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom"" (which is 1800 pages long or so, it's only flaw being that its coverage of history ends in the late 1960s). Naturally, I expected Gott's book to pick up where Thomas' book left off. And, while Gott's book does cover the revolution between 1970 and now, it does not provide any real depth or insight. Thomas' book was obviously written by a scholar who is looking to form a complete picture of Cuba's history; Gott's book, on the other hand, reads more like a newspaper article - perhaps because Gott is a journalist by training.If you're looking to really learn about Cuba, definitely get Thomas' book. Gott's isn't TOO bad, as long as it's what you're looking for."
2,The sad truth is...,"Although I found some parts of this book interesting, Mr. Gott has failed to point out the sad truth is that whatCastro has done to this island nation. He has brought equality by bringing everyone(except the party elite)to the level of medieval serfdom. I lived through the revolution, and saw personal liberty squashed into nothingness, in a system where neighbors turn you in for expressing your views criticizing the government, or having too many friends visiting you. Yes, Batista was a thug, but at least you could come and go as you pleased. I do not belong to any right wing Cuban militant groups, but only a blind man fails to see the truth."
3,I Was There,"I was there at the Carolyn Club in Columbus, Ohio when Rusty recorded the original ""All Night Long"", a facsimile of Night Train. Why doesn't some label release the hits he did in the mid fifties. Those were fabulous hits. Some were on the Carolyn Club label, others on Dot. I have all the 45s, some rough. What a treat it would be to hear this great music on CD."
4,"Good, if only for ""lower""","This has 2 old songs (bottles to the ground, dinosaurs will die) which were good on ""Pump Up The Valuum"" Lower, and Myname is Bud are good songs, and for how little this costs, they're worth it."
5,great single,I like all the songs on it! but it's a little expensive for only 4 songs! you know! for NoFX fanatics!
4,Very nice towels,"Nice size, good thickness and have remained color fast through many washings. They have not puckered or pilled.An excellent value, not the best towels I've ever owned, but certainly fine quality for the price."
1,Counterfeit..?,"Are some of these 50 Cent CD's counterfeit. The track starts to play and cuts off, and then starts again a split second later, with some sound effects filling in the gabs...? 50 Cent is my main man and I cant imagine he'd be to impressed with this..."
3,Good book in five years,This is a great book it just isn't for the faint at heart. I would recommend this book if you have a real rating of 1500 or higher or an online rating of 1800. I am rated 1700 on chessmaster and have drawn simulated grandmasters my online rating is 1500 but this book was definately beyond my scope.
3,Office Professional 2007,Took longer to load than expected. Seems to require much longer time to open programs and for programs to respond once open. Not sure if that is extra security checks going on or what. I found the instructions more an advertisement of the products than a help as to adjusting views and basic understanding of functions/functionality. HELP never seems to be very helpful as is typical with MS products.
1,Returning it ASAP,"After I bought it but before I installed it, our hired office geek told me it's one of the worst MS Offices created. I'm glad I learned that before I installed it. Phew! Saved by the geek."
5,Great Office Management Tool / Pricey,Been using MS Office Professional for several years. 2007 made some significant changes including the ribbon. Can't seem to get used to it but overall the product is excellent but PRICEY.
2,I HATE IT!,I really hate this version of Microsoft Office. It takes more steps to do basic stuff than it did in the 2003 version. It is NOT as user friendly as 2003 Microsoft Office. I have not found anything yet that has given me an Aha moment with this version. I personally think Microsoft took a step or two backwards on this one.
2,Way too complicated,"2003 gave me all the feature I wanted and they were easy to find. In your efforts to make things easy to find, you have made the product far more complicated and features I used regularly much arder to find. I'm still looking for improvements."
5,Microsoft Office Professional 2007 is Great.,"I had been holding off on upgrading from Office 2003, but was having problems with Outlook. So I gave in and ordered this upgrade. It is great, and works really well with Windows 7."
4,Office 2007,"About time microsoft issued the next version of windows Office. It's going to take hours on end (a lot) for everone to learn how to operate this software systems but once you do, it's going to make the office task easier."
1,Office 2007 - big mistake,"I excitedly upgraded to Office 2007....'07 Outlook is FAR slower - ties my reasonably powerful machine up in knots (110% of resources) for minutes at a time inexplicably; spell ck doesn't work consistently; HTML emails have lost functionality I used to use often with 2003 ver; Excel opens MUCH more slowly; no real gains in Excel fuctionality; various add-ins essential to my biz no longer work in Excel 2007; Access 2007 was billed as much easier to use - FALSE; Word has a couple of improvements but messes up spell ck with Outlook if you keep both Word 2003 & 2007 on yr machine; the highly touted ""Ribbon"" is mainly cosmetic; I believe 2007's indexing is at the heart of some of sluggisness which might be ok if it worked..but it retruns strange results....NET, NET, I am uninstalling Office 2007 and going back to 2003 with all its stupid faults....it's too bad no one at MSFT actually uses thier products to realize how defective they are."
3,Upgrade - do you really have to?,"Overall, happy with the upgrade but not without frustrations. The ribbon takes getting used to and can be frustrating but other improvements in Excel are an improvement."
5,Microsoft Office 2007,"Works as advertised, a little glitch on install, you have to remove the trial version first (if you are running one). While a little bit of a learning curve for old windows users its feature set and look and feel are an improvement. Also pretty snappy while running Vista Business."
2,Incredibly slow,I have had every version of office and this is the first time I have unloaded the program after installing. It is so incredibly slow that I went back to Office 2003. It doesn't help that they have an advertisment show before it opens each module. Outlook is the worst of all and I have no intension of using it unless they can improve performance. What a disappointment.
1,"Crash, Lose Work, Repeat...","You've gotta love Microsoft. They must spend more time protecting their monopoly than preparing their products properly before release. I have the hardware to run this suite and I installed it on a clean Win XP SP2 system. All patches and updates are current.Excel crashes constantly and I lose all my work (in spite of setting up to auto-save every 2 minutes). It wastes a lot of time. The number of ""error reports"" that my machine automatically sends every time Office encounters an problem must be huge. Here's an error report, Microsoft: If its BROKE, don't ship it!"
2,Review by Dr. Phil,"I have been a loyal Microsoft user for many years and a real fan of Excel.The radical changes in the menus require relearning this software, which appears to be an unnecessary change.It's difficult to find some of the same previous functionalityI want my dog back and the prior menu setup."
3,Time-consuming,"Upgrading from Office 2003 to 2007 is very time-consuming trying to find the functions I USED TO use in Office 2003! Trying to find the right pulldown to get to ""strike outs"", formulas, etc.Like going from Windows XP to Vista; a ""pain in the ---"""
1,SLOW as mud - don't do it!,"I installed Office 2007 as an ""upgrade"" from Office 2003. Word and Excel are OK - the user interface changes in Excel are a little annoying, but the XML capabilities (for pro version) are necessary, and I wrote it down to natural human resistance to change.Outlook 2007, however, was so slow as to be unusable. The thing literally took 2 minutes to open (that's with a 2GHz chip and 3G of RAM) and the normal operations, while I'm sure I'd become accustomed to the slowness after a while - just aren't worth the wait."
1,Don't buy if you have earlier version,I had to purchase the 2007 upgrade when I bought my new computer and could not find the disk for my earlier version of Office Professional. They have changed it so much to look like adobe that I spend more time trying to do simple task as center a column in Excel than working on the project. If I ever find the disk for the last version I will reload it into my new computer.
1,Do Not Buy This,"I believe the next time Microsoft makes a new version of the Microsoft Office Suite, perhaps they should go back to DOS. I have never had the displeasure that I have now since purchasing this software suite. Imagine everything you know about Microsoft Office being stripped away and being replaced with a new program that has the same exact functionality (nothing new what so ever), only every button, check box, function, and flexibility being stripped away. What you are imagining now is the new 2007 version. If you buy this program, the moment you start it for the first time, you will realize you made a mistake. Go back to 2003."
3,MS Office Professional 2007 Upgrade,"The product was delivered very quickly and in excellent condition. The price was very attractive (maybe too much so). The installation went smoothly and the applications work properly. However, this product did not pass Microsoft's Validation test! It states that it was misused, stolen, or not valid. Further, Microsoft states that it is counterfeit or improperly licensed. Since the Product ID shows as valid and the products work properly, I'll keep it. But I would suggest dropping or notifying the vendor of this situation."
5,MS Office Professional 2007,"Microsoft Office Professional 2007 UPGRADEThis is an excellent office suite and it is definitely worth buying the upgrade for the savings. The suite of programs are easy to use, integrate well, and are almost universally compatible with other users. Be aware that MS Works can be upgraded which makes this quite economical."
2,Office Professional 2007,"I have upgraded my office product every time Microsoft has provided an update... this is the first time I am regretting that choice. I like and use all of the suites in MS Professional, I am completely frustrated with all of the changes to the tool bar in Office. It took me 1 day to learn to print and save a document in Word. I may actually have to read the instruction manual after being an Office user for over 15 years. Ridiculous!"
2,"Dumbed-down, slower, and harder to use","The new ribbon design is supposed to make it easier to learn and use. It may be for some new users but for experienced users, it isn't. This version takes away some critical nuts & bolts customization features and many tasks now take longer to perform. This is not due to the learning curve, it is the inherent nature of the way the ribbon works. Once you are familiar with the program, nothing is faster than the old menu structure. If Microsoft added an option to allow users to choose between menus and ribbons, it would be the best of both worlds, satisfying the needs of both new and experienced users. The new version does not run macros as fast however. My recommedation for existing users: keep Office 2003 for as long as you can and consider going to Open Office when Microsoft no longer supports 2003 (unless they restore the functionality in a newer release of 2007)."
1,Do not Waste Money on Office 2007 Upgrade,"Office 2007 offers no new or useful function to Office 2003 users. It does have a new and confusing user interface so that you will have to search for even the most basic functions to save or open documents.So far, I have not found any fault in 2003 that has been addressed in 2004. I only purchased it because 2003 would not load in Vista 32.However, due to a hardware failure I found that Office 2003 does load and operate in Vista 64. Spend your money on a 64 bit processor and keep Office 2003."
5,From a Children's Literature Professor,This is a super book! It is very practical for teachers: easy to follow and to adapt for various grade levels. It is also useful for teachers working with the writing process and writing workshops.
5,low-fat korean cooking,I found that this book was the most authenic and has easy to follow instructions. The foods were wonderful just like my mom would make. The author who is the cooking school instructor at the time she wrote this book knows that people need to see how the food is made and how the finished product should look. By giving step by step instructions with pictures it was very easy to try the recipes. I've ordered her first book in the series healthful korean cooking and can't wait to recieve it.
4,"Great in general, temp/humidity sensor takes time to adjust","I bought this product for recording the weather conditions when I run. The unfortunate thing about this is that the sensors are internal and require almost 20-30 minutes to adjust from your house to new surroundings like the outside. But it is very useful and durable nontheless. I would have loved it more if it had another row of numbers like some other stopwatches. But it works pretty well for the temp/humidity readings if you let it adjust. The heat index seems very off. If it's 35 deg out with 60% humidity, is the heat index really 80-90 deg?"
1,"very informative,many ? answered",Ive sent this book as a gift. My friend in turn is lending it out very popular. Covers alot great for kids to understand
4,Fun for Saturday morning activity,"My son (age 6) and I have had fun on Saturday mornings working through some of these activities. The activities have been both educational and easy to do. The instructions are easy to follow. Some of the activities are too simple and we did not do them. One of the activities sounded simple, but was difficult. It was using thread to cut through an ice cube. We did not ever take the amount of time necessary to get through it.I do not have other books to compare this one to, but this was exactly the kind of book we wanted."
4,"Poorly written, but interesting.....","There is definitely a lot of interesting information in this book (that's why I gave it 4 stars), unfortunately it isn't written very well. Much of the problem stems from the fact that the narrative is from the perspective of someone else recounting Mike Frost's story, and it comes across a little shallow. But the book suffers from more than just poor writing - their is also a stream of hypocrisy running all the way through it. Essentially, Mike Frost says that he chose to be a spy and had no issue with spying on Russians, or any other ""bad"" country. He then goes on to say that he was very uncomfortable spying on Canadians, but did it anyway. At no point does he ever point out that he could have walked away.Over all, the book has quite a lot of interesting information about Canada's involvement in cold war spying. Unfortunately, the book sounds so whiny that you're never sure exactly what is true."
2,So Canadian,The jealousy and immature opinions from some of our northern cousins never fails to amaze me. This book is about an acholholic Canadian agent that gets canned. I found it quite boring and what came across to me was a constant whine from the author. In short it was a drag and not recomended. A boring non fiction spy story. That in and of itself is an unusual literary achievement.
3,Shipping was fast!,Some of the paint colors were dried out... but I added paint thinner to use them. Overall arrived on time and did not have any issues with the Item.
4,"Decent stands for the money, a little stiff though","As light stands go, these are a good bang for your buck. They're tall and they get the job done. On the negative side, the joints are a little stiff and getting it to open can be a bit of a chore some times, but hey, overall, they're great."
4,Good product!,"It's the 1st and only lightstand I own. When put to it's limit extension, it seems a bit unstable, but so far nothing bad happened. If its possible, I use a gaffer/duct tape to make sure it's securely sticked to the floor. Outside, sandbags are a must, of course."
2,Quills soundtrack is mediocre at best,This soundtrack plays pieces I do not recall ever hearing in the movie--and the music itself is very creepy sounding. Not at all what I had expected.
4,old limey hardcore,"this is intense early eighties hardcore brit punk. Not sounding like many of the metal/punk bands of the day (GBH, Discharge, English Dogs, Exploited, Broken Bones, etc.)they breed their own dirty brand of punk. If you like the Subhumans, you will like this. In fact, this is what the Subhumans would have sounded like if they were strung out ... An absolute must for hardcore fans."
5,Excellent book!,"It took me a couple months of my own time reading this book to prepare myself for a second round back to school. I have not programmed in almost 8 years and it was in C. I have to say that as an introductory programming book, Savitch did a superb job. You cannot get any more clear on the topics of the basics and foundations of the Java language than this. If you're just a passerby that just wants to get yourself started in Java, I recommend this book."
1,Would be great if it were 7 minutes long,"Unlike the 30 second and one minute gems on the E.P.s and ""Death Church,"" the songs on ""Pope Adrian"" are *really long.* But the longer track lengths certainly do not indicate more developed songwriting. Most every song here consists of a single lyric repeated for three to four minutes. This tries my patience. Sixty repetitions of a single two-word phrase is too much.""Pope Adrian"" has none of fire, originality, or energy, of the band's earlier work. The song length, repetition, and total absence of hooks together result in an album that consistently fails to involve the listener.If you are new to RP, this is the worst place to start. Go for ""The EPs of RP"" or ""Death Church,"" both classics of the genre. If you are a fan of these two albums, itching for more, I won't be able to stop you. But I'll sleep better tonight knowing I tried."
4,Untitled.,"As surreal as this may sound, the album has nothing to do with music composition or how long, fast or punk the tracks may be. This record is seen as a perfect window into the deamons of Nick Blinko's brain. As written inbetween psych ward visits, it is a main course from the criminally insane. and boy is it yummy:)"
3,"Spunky, Promising","When the rockabilly-tinged ""Pour Me"" crackled over the airwaves, the buzz started around Trick Pony. Although it could have flown higher, the self-titled debut album is a welcome blast of air in the too-often stale country atmosphere. No matter what the trio of Heidi Newfield, Ira Dean, and Keith Burns do on this album, it's chock full of spirit. The best cuts are the ones with energy and attitude -- ""Pour Me,"" the retribution song ""Party of One,"" the high-speed lament about no dough ""Spent"" (co-written by David Lee Murphy), and a great cover of Johnny Cash's ""Big River"" with Cash himself and Waylon Jennings joining in. They occasionally, as in the messy ""More Like Me,"" get stuck in some ill-advised pop/hiphop affectations (a lot of that going around in ""country"" records), but on balance Trick Pony turned in a promising debut."
2,Country Pop Music No Matter How You Look at It,"With the exception of the first song, it's pretty much a country pop album, complete with little snippets of conversation to show how cool they are. Not my cup of tea. If I want honky tonk, give me Heather Myles."
4,Old favorite,"Heidi Newfield's new solo disc is so good that it remined me how much I loved this one when it was new! Trick Pony is infectious fun and toe tappin', I had to go back and buy a copy of this old favorite of mine."
4,Trick Pony Review,"I LOVE ""Pour Me"" -- the first song on the CD! It just makes you want to dance. Woohoo! The 2nd and 3rd songs are fantastic too -- you can't skip any songs on this CD."
2,Not what I expected,"Very thin, very hard, corrugated, the mouse does not glide like it says. Not what I expected, I don't like it at all. Only advantage is that is so thin could be kept inside the laptop when folded."
4,Nice for Travel,"I was looking for a thin pad for travel and this fits the bill. It works fine and the mouse glides easily. It is smaller then most, but that is it's selling feature and why people would want to buy it. It is slippery and doesn't have as much tactile feel as a regular pad, but still works just fine for me."
2,Small and uncomfortable,"Too small for comfortable use. It would not remain stuck with the table, but shift often when I moved the mouse. Get a regular mouse pad and not this thin ""portable"" gimmick"
1,Worked fine for about 1 year max,"Using Windows XP Pro. Worked fine for about a year. Then it started to only transfer data at super super slow speeds. I've tried it on 4 computers that all work fine with other USB devices and card readers, but it does the same thing, complains it was plugged into a USB 1.1 port. I haven't had a computer with USB 1.1 ports for 5 years.The front panel that swings down and becomes the support is poorly designed and can't even support the weight of the reader empty. It will push shut and hit your cards. Buy another model or brand because this one is a lemon."
2,fast when it works,"I have to agree with the reviewer who noted driver problems. My reader worked intermittently on my old computer (sometimes defaulting to USB 1 - incredibly slow) and doesn't work at all on my new one. Lexar maintains that no driver is required, and doesn't provide one on its web site, but my experience is that plug-n-play on XP is flaky with this device.When it works, it's great, except for the minor annoyance of the door tending to flip shut when disturbed."
3,Lexar Media MULTI CARD READER ( RW022-001 ),"Surprisingly enough this device didn't function with my HP Pavillion Desktop computer, but it did with my Dell Inspiron 1100 Laptop computer. I had to acquire a different brand locally for my HP. This may be due to a peculiarity in theHP, which is getting cranky (I may have to upgrade)."
3,Does not work with cards over 1GB,"Realiable, easy to use, but does not work with newer large format cards (works with CF cards up to 1GB, but not SD cards 2 GB and larger)"
3,"Pretty good, don't pay anymore than $19.99 though,",Just paid 34 bucks for this thing at Target and opened it before I realized it was only 19.99 here.Anyhow the product works. It's very cheapy feeling though. Kinda light. It does do what I need it to do though. 2.0 USB so transfers are quite fast. Using it for my Laptop and it is very handy and portable. So if you need and adapter for your camera or phone memory then this does the job for the price.
5,Great Service and Product,I ordered a Lexar Media Multi Card Reader. I didn't know there was such a thing. When it came everything worked perfect and for a price everyone could afford.
1,SD slot stopped working!,"The SD slot stopped working last night - very frustrating. The compact flash card slot still works, though. I noticed a reviewer mentioned that it didn't work with their 4GB SD card. It did work with my Transcend 150x 4GB SD card."
1,Will fail eventually...,"I an now on my second of these readers and this one, just like the one it replaced, now is not recognized by my Dell computer. Both worked fine for 6-12 months but then died."
2,It was surprise for me,Before I bought this reader I considered 2 models 12-in-1: Lexar and SanDisk. I decided to buy Lexar.I bought this reader to use mostly with Memory stick. I have 2 cards: 128 MB and 1 GB. I had no problem with 128 MB card.But I could not insert My GIG card into this reader. It just did not go. I tried hard trying not to break the card - no success. It was a surprise for me. May be because my card was made not by Lexar - by SanDIsk...? I contacted Lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem.Any way I had to send it back and buy 12-in-1 SanDisk Reader.

4,Don't know what will happen next!,"Monster's Ring is really exiting to read.As soon as something good starts to happen something better begins.This book would've been better if Bruce Coville had changed when ""Russel"" attacks his school.Then I would've given five stars!"
3,Like the others.....,"Like the other books in this series, this book focuses on a kid that buys a magic item. This item happens to be a ring, and it turnds the kid into a demon-like creature. This book was interesting and fun to read. I enjoyed it a lot."
4,A Solid Entry in the Magic Shop series,"This book is a fine addition to the Magic Shop series. As usual we have a magic item that may or may not help a middle school kid with his or her problem. Here, the problem is bullying, and while lots of book address that problem, they do so with wildly varying degrees of success. This one takes a turn toward standing up for yourself, which is OK by me. Again as in all of the Magic Shop books there are other issues as well - babying by Mom, poor communication with Dad, not paying attention to instructions and warnings. This all sounds pretty preachy, but it isn't. It just acknowledges that from the point of view of middle school drama, these are the kinds of things that come up.The hero is believable and sympathetic. There are some funny bits with secondary characters. All in all a quick but satisfying read with some excitement, some mild instruction, and a sense of humor. Not bad."
4,Two weeks ols and fallinng apart,"I bought the first three books of this series. The books were so good every kid in the family read it, including the 16yr old. I don't know if it was the easy reading or the unique storyline that taught a lesson without getting in you face, but the book is barely two weeks old and it looks like its been rread a hundred times. This wasn't the best of the three, but it was still a great book for the kids and a great deal. I have already ordered the last two books!btl anglChicago"
5,seperated,it is sooo romantic and peacefulwith a few words usher expresses all what a guy can feel beside a girli love it
1,"Bad, in a truly amazing way.","A historical oddity as well as a very bad and very racist book. In this entry in the popular series, written in the late 1930's, Nayland Smith rescues thinly disguised versions of Hitler and Mussolini from the evil ""Yellow Peril"", Fu Manchu. His only reason seems to be that, well, they may not be our sort of people, but they are white, dash it all.I wish I could have read Mr. Rohmer's mail over the next few years, after WWII started! Here it is fifty-plus years later and I still can't believe it."
5,Great overview of Kim's recorded songs,"The liner notes indicate that Kim Richey picked her favorite songs from each of her four albums. It is a balanced set with about four songs from each album. There is one new song, ""Break You Down"", and a live acoustic version of ""Electric Green"". It would have been nice to have live versions of other songs because I love her as a performer, but this is a very good collection for new listeners and an enjoyable one for long time fans as well. This collection highlights her incredible songwriting, and I recommend it highly."
5,Pull Handles,Handles we purchaced were not the same as I was trying to match in the kitchen so we were able to use them in the bathroom. Like them there and I'm still looking to match the ones I have in the kitchen.
4,"You, too, can be a long-range cyanide murderer","Your rich uncle dies on a London-Paris flight (U.K. title ""The 12:30 from Croydon""; typically loving Crofts details on 1930s passenger aviation). You weren't there, but you did it all right (solid explanation of your factory problems in the Depression and your need for a quick-fix legacy; several chapters of systematic thinking on how to research, acquire, and safely administer cyanide). Unfortunately, Inspector French is on the job, and at your trial . . . ."
3,Haven't I heard this before?,"These guys seem to do a lot better remixes than whole albums. A couple of tracks stand out as being less mediocre than the rest; Like Tears in Rain, Dead Stars, and Tour de Force. Of course, there are singles of these songs, with mixes more interesting than the original. It's not a bad album, and even mostly enjoyable, but not terribly exciting."
3,a few great songs with a lot of filler,"I've decided this deserves at least three stars for the two great dance songs it includes, Dead Stars and Like Tears in Rain. Unfortunately, most of the other material consists of rather repetitive sounds with a chorus repeated over them, as if the band could not be bothered to expend more energy developing the album. This makes me further appreciate bands like The Cruxshadows and VnV Nation, who can produce danceable songs and then back them up with albums where every song is a worthwhile listen."
2,Vanitiy Piece,"I read and loved ""Soul Mountain."" I've lived five years in China myself, and I found the work extrememly moving and meaningful. It's maybe my favorite book. It defies description.This book, ""One Man's Bible,"" however, does not defy description. It is a vanity piece by someone who wrote the book that won the Nobel Prize for literature. Like, it seems, many others, it took me quite a while to get through it.Interesting in places, but that's the best it does."
5,How sweet is this Baumer? I'll tell you.,"Okay...so myspace was actually right when they put these guys among the Top Artists. This band...is great. Half of these songs are on the mellow side, and the other half just make you want to jump up and dance. The lead singer's voice is amazing. The way he can run up the scale is just...wow. I am also really happy about their website, which lets you listen to the whole album, which is great if you want to hear before you buy. The style is really interesting. It's like...techno...but not, because...it's good. So pretty much, you should buy this CD before everyone starts talking about Baumer, because it's going to happen, and Mtv will rape them just like they did with Panic! at the Disco...so get to them while they're still untouched by ""the man""...do it."
5,A Classic From One of Country Music's Best Vocalists,"This album is excellent and I enjoyed it much more than his previous effort, ""Under the Influence."" Alan Jackson's vocals are simply outstanding and the songs are well-written. Given the title of the first song selection, I must note that I like meat and potatoes myself."
5,Alan Jackson Does It Again,"Once again Alan comes out with an album that wrenches the very soul. As always, all songs on the album are potential chart toppers and can be related to by the masses, and especially this ole country fan. I will always be an Alan Jackson fan, I have followed his career and been to many of his concerts, and have all of his music. How can you go wrong with an album like ""When somebody Loves You""? A must have for country music fans!"
5,"WHEN SOMEBODY LOVES YOU ""THEN THATS WHEN LIFE BEGINS""!!",ALAN JACKSON DID IT AGAIN! HE KEEPS THE TRADITION IN COUNTRY SINCE THE VERY BEGINING IV'E ALWAYS LIKED THE COWBOY SEARCHING FOR THAT NEON RAINBOW LIVING THAT HONKY TONK DREAM THANKS MAN.
5,When Somebody Loves You,"I have enjoyed listening to Alan Jackson's ""When Somebody Loves You"". I received the CD promptly."
1,Not up to par,"Really a sub-standard album. I have always liked Alan Jackson and respected the high quality of his music, particularly in an age where ""pop country"" has practically taken over the entire industry. But, with this CD, Jackson has apparently decided to go the same route as other musicians who had previously put out worthwhile albums. Not one song with any substance here--www.memory being the only one with any potential. Cheesy lyrics and overdone themes. While you can still hear his trademark vocal and guitar stylings, they amount to nothing more than empty vessels given the poor writing and lack of substance. Pass on this album and buy some of Jackson's excellent earlier work."
2,Poor recording.,"What? I thought this would rule! But unfortunatley, it doesn't. It's a poor CD, with some poor material recorded on it. Why? Because it's MELLOW. If you're loooking for hot, firey soul jazz, look elsewhere, check out Melvin Sparks' Legends of Acid Jazz CD, or Rusty Bryant's, but please, do not start with this one.I agree, 'The Son of Man', 'The Houston Express' and 'Give More Power To The People (For God's Sake)' rule, no two ways about that. But the rest? FILLERS! Seriously, there are better purchases to spend your money on."
4,A saxophone dream,I am a true sax lover and have played for years. Joe knows what he is doing in every way and will tear at your soul and make your heart jump.
2,Tangles Necklaces,"I got this for my wife at Christmas. We then had to travel across country from SC to WA. During the trip she kept some of her jewelry in this case. You know, the stuff she wears all the time. Well I spent hours untangling all her necklaces. They slip into the top of the case and are held in place by a little hook. The other end is free to move around. Presto! tangled necklaces. There is no way to hold the bottoms in place and if the case turns upside down (which happens when your moving luggage) the necklace slips off the top clip. Very disappointed."
1,leather pocketbook jewelry case,not what i needed in size (too small for all the jewelry my granddaughter like to carry with her most of the times
2,Pretty darn depressing.,"I have a child who also has this disorder. Loving Rachel was important for me to read because there are no other books written which address Optic Nerve Hypoplasia or Septo Optic Dysplasia, but I want everyone to know who considers reading this that Loving Rachel is not a guide for you or your child and that no two people are affected in exactly the same way by this disorder. I could relate with some of the things Ms. Bernstein wrote about but mainly I walked away from this book feeling sad for this family and for Rachel."
5,Sometimes Old Fashioned Methods work the best,"I don't know why I like this book, but it has worked well for us. I am homeschooling my 5 year old, and we have numerous other reading resources in addition to this (Bob books, dolche sight words in flash card form, Phonics Pathways) I picked this book up on a whim, not sure if we would even use it, but its history appealed to me, and my daughter likes it so much we've integrated it into our lessons 3-4 days a week. My 3 year old likes looking at it too, especially the beginning alphabet section. Won't be long before she's reading it as well."
4,Easy read,"An easy read, as well as an informative look on the Vietnam War from an insider's perspective. Had to buy this for class, but made it much easier to bear with."
5,One of the best books I've ever read...,"This book is flat out amazing. It's one of the best I've ever read, and it is at the top of my list of books I recommend and give as gifts to friends. I found the story very gripping, the narration style and point of view to be very unique. While reading it, ask yourself who is telling the story. It gives me chills to just think about that.I know there is room in the world for different opinions, but I just can't help but feel that those who question the books writing style and content just don't get it. This book is very powerful, and I can't recommend it highly enough."
3,These wars have left us without a soul,"When did America lose its soul? Or has it ever had a soul? Alexis de Tocqueville said it had--in the 1830's: ""America is great because she is good. . ."" he wrote. Langston Hughes implied it had when he states in a poem ""Let America be America again.""But what goodness, what soul is there left in Paco, after the hell that was Vietnam?And now that generation has fathered souls that are fighting and dying (and killing) in the hell that is Iraq.Protracted wars harm nations, de Tocqueville warned. And his quote above finishes: ""If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.""Will cease or has ceased?"
5,The Best PTSD Story Ever,"If you've been there done that you KNOW. Paco is you and me. Read it and learn, read it and remember. No offense meant. Just the way it was/is. Peace. bebutt1@aol.com."
2,Disappointing,"I was never drawn into the story. The writing and editing could have been better. The distant narrator left me feeling uninvolved, and I never felt or cared anything for the characters. For a well-written Vietnam story that draws the reader in, read The Proud Bastards."
4,Snapshot of Life During/After Nam,"Paco's Story is about young Paco Sullivan. Sole survivor of his unit's ambush, he has returned to the States to look for work. Left with painful injuries that require powerful painkillers every day, Paco encounters both curiousity and discrimination from the locals in the small town he ends up in.Paco's story is written with graphic, lyrical language that brings his horrific war memories, and his trying to fit in as a veteran of a war that nobody really understood, to life. Heinemann writes in an unusual, dream-like way that just draws the reader in, until they feel like they are feeling what Paco feels. He writes of Paco's seemingly mundane experiences and transforms them into something cathartic. A must read for anyone interested in Nam."
2,Texas Tenors,"I was disappointed in the CD. I was wanting the singing group Texas Tenors, not a CD of Sax. music. The cover did not distingush the contents and has the same name."
4,The Sun in my Eyes vol. 2,I enjoyed reading the second part of Josie's tour of Japan. It gave a good view of the country outside of the main tourist centres and I enjoyed her humerous comments.
4,"""Buddy Holly Story"" is NOT Widescreen Despite What the Case States","I found this double-disc set this afternoon and bought it JUST FOR the WS copy of ""The Buddy Holly Story"" to replace my old FS VHS copy. Although the slipcase, the DVD case and Amazon's website all clearly state ""Buddy Holly"" is 1.85 anamorphic widescreen it ISN'T-- it's 1.33:1. And in case you are thinking maybe I don't have my DVD player's aspect ratio correctly selected, there is a title card at the end of the movie which says the movie has been ""modified . . .formatted to fit your TV"". This pisses me off bad!!!"
3,Good movies,"I had been wanting to get these two movies on dvd for a long time and when I saw that I could purchase them together, I couldn't pass it up.I thought the acting was excellent in both films and even though I had read that not everything was accurate in them, I still found them to be entertaining and enjoyable to watch."
2,Buddy Holly story,"Highly inaccurate portrayal of Buddy Holly, did not even get the name of the members of the Crickets correct.Totally ignored Norman Petty Studios in Clovis, New Mexico, where the best of the music was recorded."
1,Pretty but too fragile,"Buyer beware! Beautiful to look at but you can't actually USE it! Especially if you have kids. All are chipping. And Pfaltzgraff didn't stand behind this product for us. After a few months we called to complain and ask to exchange for another style, but we were basically told, ""Sorry, no exchange. Everybody knows stoneware chips, you should have selected a different material"". Um, what? That wasn't on your product description. This junk chips when you put it in the dishwasher and it bumps against another plate! So after barely a year, we will be throwing out a HUGE set that we purchased during a kitchen remodel. (Same review posted for 16-piece set.)"
1,Do not order this dinnerware set.,"I ordered this set on November 15,2007. It is now December 30, 2007 and it has not shipped yet. I now have an estimated ship date of January 25, 2008. Ships in 3-5 days my eye, more like 3-5 Months."
1,horrible promises - never will buy big items from Amazon again,I placed an order in first few days of February 2008 for Napoli dishes (48 pc) and it never listed as BACKORDER. Week after week Amazon continues to put my order on backorder. I'm disgusted. Now they are telling me that the order will ship early May. I am sorry I wasted all this time waiting for these dishes when Pfaltzgraff would have shipped in two days! GRRRR!!!! I'm done with Amazon unless it costs me less than $20!!!!! too bad. Now I know better. I'm canceling my order. Unless you have a year to waste... don't buy it.
3,"Good product, with limitations","If like me you're using this with an older Macintosh PowerBook, know where to find and download the software for your older Mac. If you're accustomed to the simplicity of setting up WI-FI on a newer Mac, this isn't as simple to set up.You need at least Mac OS 8.6 to run this device on an older Mac, and then you'll need to find and download the Orinoco drivers.The best encryption available for this device is WEP, which these days is pathetically inadequate unless you live in the middle of nowhere. Don't know whether or not you can get WPA encryption support for this device on an OS X system."
1,Terrible card,"The software for this card is the worst. I noticed in another review someone had good luck running it with a D-Link 614+ router, I could never get it to connect. Maybe it's a Windows 98 issue but there is no conflict with card as far as 98 goes. Even the software that came with the card indicates it is working properly. I've tried everything including changing TCP/IP settings directly and the card will not connect with the 614+. Tech support is about a joke. After fighting with this card for hours I went and got a Microsoft USB and it ran 5 minutes out of the box."
1,Late delivery,"This product is advertised as being shipped within 24 hours.I am still hoping to receive it tomorrow, after placing the order two days ago, with an additional 19 USD for a 24 hours shipping..."
5,Reliable product for a fare price,"ORiNOCO PC GOLD CARD. I installed this and updated the driver on windowsupdate.mircosoft.com instantly. I am running both Windows XP and Red Hat 8 and it works great on both platforms. Very cool!What can I say, I love it!"
5,A Great Book from a Great Philosopher,"I recommend this book to anyone who has ever tried to think about ""nature"". This book shows how the concept of nature has changed in Western Civilization, and how we can best think about this abstract concept today."
1,"Spend a few bucks more, and buy a good book","Ralph covered how to run (any) software package, and how to connect to the internet. He also reviewed, in depth, Family Tree Maker, the only genealogy software he seems to be familiar with. If you don't know much about the internet or computers, this book will be helpful.However, most of us are familiar with both (Hey, we're on Amazon.com, aren't we?), so more than half the book is wasted. There are about ten pages of weblinks which can be had simply by going to a decent search engine, like Yahoo!. Spend your money on another genealogy book."
3,Where's the end of the book?,"While I really enjoyed this book (as well as all of the other Suzanne Forster books that I've read), I've got to ask...what happened to the ending? There is a major climax and then....nothing. An epilogue or something would have been very appropriate."
4,"Fast Paced, but abrupt ending","I thought this was a pretty good book. Gus and Jack's characters compliment each other and the plot takes some unexpected twists and turns. A little too much time is spent on Gus's character and how she became the way she is. After reading two other of Ms. Forster's later works (Husband, Lover, Stranger and Innocence) I see a pattern of very intricate plots, but quickly wrapped up endings. You're reading and all of a sudden the book is over. Despite this detail, this book is worth reading."
3,Big Dissapointment,"I normally like Suzanne Forster's books, but this one falls short. Her usual intriguing and exotic storyline just doesn't have that zing that her former stories share. Instead I found myself flipping through the pages just wanting to end it quickly, because i could care less what happened to the characters. All I wanted to do was at least finish the book and make it worth what it was not. Warning to all who are considering this book, skip it and try one of her other books instead or save your money."
1,extremely disappointed!,"I truly wish I had kept the box to send this back! The wheel configuration is so poorly designed, they fell off, and I can't find the parts to put it back together! I contacted the mfg about this, and no response. A very expensive mistake."
1,Customer Service is POOR,"Bought their cart. Came with a bent front wheel. Wobbles when you push it. Notified customer service several days ago. No response, not even to a followup email. They apparently have decided to ignore me now that they have my money. Beware!"
1,Disappointed in product,"The biggest problem with this product was that the front wheels are fixed. I did not even think about this being a problem until I was walking home with groceries. The front wheels should pivot like a stroller or a grocery cart. By the time I got home, the front wheels had fallen off. Just two pins hold them in place. I had no problem putting it together, but the fixed wheels were my biggest problem. I ordered the Wonder Wheeler which has pivoting front wheels instead."
3,Afraid about sturdiness,"This was my first folding shopping cart purchase, so I compared reviews for several carts. This cart seemed to have the best reviews relative to its price. Unfortunately I am a little doubtful about my purchase. First of all, you have to assemble the cart yourself, and some washers were missing (not a big deal, I hope). Everything is held together only with pins and I'm worried about how long this cart will last. Maybe I am putting too much weight in the cart (several drink packs for school functions), but the wheels tend to wobble as I push the cart. I've used it four times now and it still is surviving, at least."
2,Jumbo Shopping Cart,"This cart was of good quality ... but was a bit pricy. Once you compare with those in other stores and add the shipping and handling on it, I ended up paying about $20 too much. However, we want to say we like the cart, have used it many times and it is extremely useful to us."
5,Folding shopping cart,"Great shopping cart that is taller than my older one so that the handle is at a better height for pushing around. It does hold more since it is a bit taller. Very smooth going. Foam around handle bar is comfortable. You no longer have to touch a cold handle bar in the winter. Foam handle keeps the handle from getting cold. This cart is heavier than my older one but it is made out of more heavy duty material that does not bend as easily. Assembly is required but is easy. You just have to know to bend the pins in place like you would bend the clasps on a clasp envelope. I use it for my big loads of laundry and trips to the laundromat. Because this shopping cart is made of more sturdy material, it carries heavier items with ease and you do not have to use as much force to push the cart."
4,it's good,"it' a good product, I had a hard time putting it together and still need my son to check it out, I have to take a bus to get my groceries and could never manage that without a cart."
5,This is a great product!,"I really love this grocery cart. It is exactly what I needed. I can haul heavy laundry, groceries and take out heavy trash bags from my apartment. It is just what I needed."
3,Folding Grocery Cart - Jumbo - Chrome - (Chrome),The item was received damaged due to poor packaging and while we were able to partly correct the bent parts (using special tools) it is an indication that the packaging or structure is inadequate. The supplied cotter pins are too small and my concern is that they will shear and let a wheel come off so we will replace them with larger cotter pins. The cart is large with a pleasing design and folds nicely.
1,its pathetic,"I have purchased this product from the experience i had with smaller cart, but the bigg one i purchased is pathetic. corner pins blew up on the first day and weels are going all over, and more over this piece stikns for 2 days....overall its a waste of money....buy better products and dont waste your money like meThanks,Vijay"
2,Trouble using handset,The handset will not connect despite following all the trouble shooting tips in the owner's manual. Vtech's web site and customer support was use less.Would recommend some other better brand; this phone isn't worth the money
3,"While not terrible, another phone system might be for you","I would basically suggest buying a different phone system. The reception isn't as bad as the previous reviewer said, not that it's perfect, but the features are lacking. This is only a dual handset system in that there are two phones with one base. With the previous system I owned, when you changed the programming on one phone, it changed the other phone as well. It was quite convenient. However, with this system, programming one phone does not change the other phone. More annoyingly, erasing the caller ID on one phone does not erase it on the other.Otherwise it's not a terrible phone system, and might be right for the money. However, you probably can find better out there, with better features."
3,Phone good -- second handset inconvenient,"The phone itself works very well. It also wall mounts reasonably ok. However, the two handset setup is not so convenient in that both handsets cannot be connected at the same time."
4,No major problems,"We've had this phone for about 2 years now, and we like it! We have had no problems with static noise or reception. We have a basic 2000 sq foot home and I have no problems using it in any part of our home. My only problem with it is that I think the ringer and handset volume is too loud even on the lowest setting. We mainly bought this phone because it was pretty much the only phone that we could find that came with 2 handsets and did NOT have an answering machine. We like it and have not had any problems with it what so ever."
4,The dialogue again - at last,"This is the first truly complete recording of ""Man of la Mancha"". It includes all the abduction music , the Moorish dance and the exit music. Most important, it is the first recording since the Original London Cast to include the dialogue. This makes a tremendous difference to the enjoyment of the score. Heard seperately, the songs are good but not great; put into context, they work wonderfully. Ron Raines and Kim Cresswell are the equal of their predecessors. Avery Saltzman gives what seems to be the traditional reading of Sancha - squeaky voiced and is as effective as anyone else playing the part this way. It is a shame that a different approach couldn't have been found with this character. The smaller parts aren't as sharply characterised as on the earlier complete recording. However, as that isn't available and this is and includes all the music, anyone wanting a recording of this score can purchase this with confidence."
2,No one is nice no one is truthful,"I so disliked this book that I did not want to finish it.A marriage of convenience. She gets in the family way has a miscarrage and he sends her away. Enter evil P.A. who tell all sorts of lies to wife while trying to get in the husbands pants, in including walking out of his room which he is not sharing with his wife (her choice) in the middle of the night running into said wife. Her father is a pig, the man she marries is a pig(hot , But a pig) and she is such a wimp. YUCK."
2,No illustrations by Dore,"If you are looking for an edition of this book that has illustrations by Gustave Dore, do not purchase this. As of 01/29/10, if you search for books with Dore's work in them, this turns up. There are no illustrations with this version. My rating is in no way related to the story or any other aspect of this edition, which seems fine, and is quite entertaining."
2,Free SF Reader,"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen is one of those tall tales sort of books. However, in the Baron's case, these are pretty extreme, not just stuff about big fishes. He goes on and on about all the stuff he has got up to, where he has been, who he has been, what he has ruled, what he has invented, etc. It was all pretty dull though."
1,flimsy,"as soon as I used it it broke, made very cheap amd not worth the money. fast return of product"
3,Not what we wanted,This would be ok if all you want to heat is water or coffee. Not good for soups which is what we wanted it for.
3,It worked.,"Ordered one for my trucker husband & he said it worked great. It heated up water to boiling hot, fast. But, then it stopped working after about 21 uses. Well, he wanted me to promptly order another one. He thought it might have broke because he left water in it in between uses. The new one came in time for his next trip & it worked as well as the first & is still working, however he has stopped using it because now he is driving local. Well, if we go on any road trips I guess I will find out if the first one stopped working because of human error."
2,Good while it worked,"My husband is a truck driver and he likes to heat water for instant oatmeal for breakfast. I bought the Hot Pot for him and he thoroughly enjoyed it while it worked. It only lasted two weeks! We were both disappointed.Roadpro 12V Hot Pot, 20 oz."
4,"needs to fit a vehicle cup holder, otherwise great",I agree with the review posted by Mark Lebowitz. Our biggest grip with the product is you need a table to set it on as the supplied clip really is not appropriate if the lid is not spill proof. If the bottom fit a vehicle cup holder it's short comings would be of little note and safety would be greatly enhanced.
5,ON THE GO,PERFECT ITEM FOR THOSE WHO ARE ON THE ROAD MORE THEN HOME. FROM WATER TO CHILI/SOUP ETC ITS GREAT. PLUG INTO YOUR CIGARETTE LIGHTER IN YOUR CAR/TRUCK AND THERE YOU HAVE IT.ENJOY
1,not worth it,Was really excited to try this out ....but the excitement didn't last! it barely heated a cup of water to luke warm...
1,WOW,"The little hot pot reminds me of a toy,and has that made in China standard of quality that we all know and love.My little toy hot pot leaks at the bottom and does not heat consistently.Its my fault for buying it,because you always get what you pay for.LMAO."
3,Difficult to clean (in case of milk),"For water its gud, but for milk, it is not perfect. Reason: The heating element/coil is in the center of container, where we fill liquid, so it is difficult to wash/clean milk remains from there."
1,No directions. Leaks.,Seemed like a great idea for a road trip in Iceland.No directions in box.Tested it out before leaving.Pot leaked all over car.Returned for full refund.
3,It got broken after 4th use,The main disappointment is this item did not last even for 3 days. But I liked the item design. The boiling time was kind of ok.
5,So Awesome!,"I am not kidding - this is the COOLEST thing ever! I recently drove from Colorado to Prudhoe Bay and back and used this thing almost constantly. I only used it to boil water - did not cook in it, but it is fantastic. Ramin, coffee, tea, Cup O Noodles, Easy Mac, you name it. All the crappy food you only need water to make - this is ideal! I was alone and it definately was challenging to use whilst driving, but if you do it long enough, I guarantee you will figure out a way so it's easy. I will say the holder it came with is totally useless."
1,"Heats well, leaks a lot","First time I used this product was with chicken soup. Evidently, the soup sloshed around enough to go up and over the internal ""sealed"" chamber. Well, this chamber is not sealed on top. If liquid reaches within an inch or so of the top, it will leak down the sides and out of the bottom where the cord plugs in. If you were not moving at all, or using very thick liquids, this would probably work great. Don't plan on driving around with it full of liquid."
1,Worse device EVER!!!!,Don't waste your time with this item. I bought it for a camping trip thinking it would save time boiling water on the camp fire or camping stove. After 15 minutes the water wasn't even lukewarm. TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.
2,Not Worth it,Bought the Roadpro 12v hot pot. The 1st one I got did not work. Sent it back. the 2nd one barely worked. Took 20 min to get the water hot. Not worth it as a purchase. I would not recommend it. The only good points it has is it is compact & has 2 cups to use.
1,12V hot pot,The product should not be on the market. Mine leaked and it is impossible to properly clean. I put soup in it and the soup stuck to the heating element. I returned mine.
1,Product sucks,"From day one I filled up that thermos drove to work AND coffee was allover the the passenger floor, made my car stinks for few days, top of thermos and cover will leak, don't recommend it!"
4,Great!,"These tapes are an excellent addtion to(and really a necessity for anyone who uses)the corresponding textbook, HORIZONS. They are fun and interesting in subjest matter. The only drawback to them is that they do not list the vocabulary words from the textbook, that the student might hear each word spoken individually."
4,TLA Film and Video Guide 2000-2001,"My brother gave me the TLA 1998-1999 guide for Christmas 1997 and I've been hooked since then. The 2000-2001 TLA Film and Video Guide seems more comprehensive to me than your typical movie review guides. The only thing I believe that could be improved upon is a larger Stars to Movies index. Many stars are not listed here but I like to keep the book at my side when trying to recall some of the many videos I've seen. It's well worth the money, I believe."
4,good,"I was a child in the fifties and watched superman faithfully. I really enjoyed watching it once again. I think it was more of a nostalgic warm fuzzy than anything else. (It's hard to be objective) I may buy more but if you didn't watch superman growing up, I'm not so sure you would like them as much."
5,The Adventures of Superman,This was the first tv series for Superman.I love the Stolen Costume episode.I still believe George Reeves was murdered.This is probably what led to Jerry Seinfeld's love of Superman.
3,Good memories BUT MISSING DISK 4,Great to see these old episodes been watching them as time permits since Christmas. Disc 4 was the same as Disc 5 so I never got episodes 19-24 just two discs of the Little People Pt1 &2. Trying to see what Amazon can do once I figure out where to send request.
2,Disappointed,I remember watching Superman as a kid and feeling much more impressed. Not now. Got it for my 6 y. old for Christmas - big let down. Too much weak writing and dialogue - not enough Superhero rescues. Spend the dough on Batman instead.
5,"It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a GREAT DVD set!","""Adventures of Superman - The Complete First Season"" is one terrific DVD set.I always prefered the earlier B&W; Superman adventures, they had far darker themes than the kiddy-friendly color episodes that followed.These early episodes had murders and other serious crimes and were played straight.The quality of the DVDs and the prints used for the transfers are first rate.Didn't care for the ""bonus"" commentary and the disc menu is a bit hard to navigate."
5,Adventures of superman,I very much enjoyed watching these DVD's because I had not seen them since I was a kid growing up in Pennsylvania. Anyone who enjoys old TV shows will enjoy this set of DVD's.
5,Kenny's review of the first season of 'The adventures of Superman' DVD set,"There is only one superman,and that is George Reeves.This series has been digitally restored and remastered from the original camera negatives.This show has been shown around the world every day of the week since it's inception 55 years ago.The video is sharp and so is the sound.I remember as a child watching these shows in the early 1960's(I was born in 1958)and thinking how thrilling they were to watch then.Thanks to digital technology we can now enjoy watching this series on DVD.The audio commentary is great and not drawn out and boring as is the case with many DVD sets with audio commentary.Warner Brothers deserves 100 stars for bringing the greatest and most popular television show in the history of television to DVD.WOW!!."
5,SPECTACULAR! THE MAN OF STEEL NEVER LOOKED SO GOOD!,"Growing up, ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN was my favorite show. I had hoped we'd finally get it on DVD, and my wishes have come true.The episodes look fantastic, with great extras (even Kellogg's commercials as bonus features).This is a must-have for any Superman fan who will always love George Reeves as television's greatest super hero."
3,prints,i just picked up the adventures of superman dvd yesterday. i did notice that one fo the shows the stolen costume the print and sound was all faded. i like to to ask warner brothers why this happened. it seemed this was run off a television show print. all in all most of the shows were n good quality except for this show.
4,Superman revisited,"When I was a youngster I would lay in bed listening to Superman because it was too late to watch and I was suppose to be asleep which I would inevitably do before each episode ended. Well, the big surprise watching them in their entirety is that they seem so long. This I conclude is because the advertising in those days was at least half of what it is today and the action is kept at a suspenseful tempo throughout the show. The best part is the one liners thrown around by the cast especially at the end of each show. This is no Rembrandt or Picasso but it is sure fun to watch - warts and all."
5,Adventures of Superman,These are also great shows. Georve Reeves is the Superman I remember when I was growing up. Again the packaging was Great and they exceeded my expectations in shipping time. This is a great buy for any Collector.
4,cowboy boots,The book was quite revealing. I never knew that creating cowboy boots was such an art. Beautifully photographed. It arrived in very good condition.
2,Don't Spend Your Money,"I think I now know more about the person who wrote this book than I do about Celine. Buddy, no one cares!According to Mr. Beauregard, Sony and the entire music media business would crumble and collapse without him. His ""passion"" for Celine goes far beyond being a fan and straight into obsession. I think it would serve Ms. Dion well to post a guard outside her door when this guy is around.There is some interesting stuff in the book, but it's nothing that's not in any of the other books about Celine Dion."
4,Benjy is jealous....,"In this story by Graham, author of the classic ""Harry the dirty dog"" books, Benjy is a friendly mixed breed family dog who feels jealous when Aunt Sarah bring her parrot Tilly to visit. Benjy does something not very nice when jealousy rears it's ugly head, but he quickly learns the painful consequences of his actions.Told in the dog's perspective, Benjy is a good book to teach children the wrong, then right ways to handle jealously.Though not as good as the Harry books, I'd still recommend Benjy to children up to 8.4 stars."
2,Does NOT come with wingnut !,Inaccurate description. Does NOT come with wingnut. Trying to get them to change description. Not easy. Does anyone in customer service speak english as a first language?
3,It came without a stud or wing nut.,It came with no stud or wing nut.I had to travel 26 miles to get them.
4,AFI makes an album equal to Black Sails in the Sunset x10,"AFI's fifth proper studio album. This one takes elements of Black Sails in the Sunset and kicks them up to pre-Sing the Sorrow excellence. There's not a weak song on this album, and as far as AFI goes this is probably their best effort second only to Sing the Sorrow. Hard, Fast and Melodic it doesn't get much better than this. Davey is starting to get into the full-on Gothic Poetry lyrics he dabbled with in Black Sails, and it completely fits the album. Jade's unique guitar style, Hunter's catchy Cure-meets-punk basslines, and Adam's driving beats make this album a great AFI collection. I can't say enough about it. Definitely pick this one up. Key Song(s): The Lost Souls, Smile, The Days of the Phoenix"
5,Definitely AFI's best so far...,"I really do love this cd. I was hooked after hearing the intro and Lost Souls, and I have been listening to this non-stop ever since. This album really showcases Davey Havok's fantastic voice, and some awesome guitar playing as well. The songs are heavy and fast, but there are some slower ballad type songs too. My favorite track is ""Wester,"" but ""Lost Souls,"" ""A Story at Three,"" and ""The Nephilim"" are great too. This is a very worthwhile album, and I can't wait to see these guys live!"
5,ohhhhhh my,"Simply put, this is one of the best albums ever made. AFI rules. If you like this, go out and get Black Sails. It's similar to this and their 2nd best according to me."
3,"Some great songs, some average ones.",Morning star itself is enough reason to buy this album.What a great song! I can't understand why it isn't topping the charts...6 to 8 and days of pheonix are great too....some songs don't work though.
3,"Good, but gets old real quick","When i first listened to this CD i thought it was pretty good. Ya know, i've heard better. I kept listening to it a couple more times and enjoyed it just as much. But after awhile it just got old. It just starts to bug you. Davey Havok's voice is one thing that you can just get tired of quick. And they're style never changes. Each song sounds the same. All the slow ones sound like one long song and all the fast ones sound like one song broken up. If there was a place where you could rent CDs, this one would be one that you just rent and don't buy. The same goes for all AFI cds"
3,A LET DOWN,"i KNEW IT WOULD BE HARD LIVING UP TO BLACK SAILS WHICH IS AN AMAZING ALBUM, BUT THIS NEW ALBUM KINDA <SUCKS>. THERE ARE A FEW GOOD SONGS (#'S 2,4,9,10) BUT MOST OF IT IS REDUNDANT AND THROWN TOGETHER, YOU ARE BETTER OFF WITH BLACK SAILS OR SHUT YOUR MOUTH, A GREAT LIVE SHOW THOUGH..."
3,"Not AFI's best, but a decent album","To be honest, I was slightly dissapointed with this album. The lyrics were really well written, though. The lyrics on this album are also the darkest they have ever been. The playing was good, but could have been better. The album was not very ""polished"". But overall, this was a good, solid rock album."
5,I FELL INTO FANTASY,"Fellow AFI fans, I have only one word to describe this album and that word is.................fjalkfl;aksjlk;asj"
1,"Is this supposed to be the ""mainstream"" album?","I listened to this album several times wondering what the .... was wrong. For example, why did it sound like every other punk band out these days? Why did some of the songs sound like blatant Danzig ripoffs? The whole thing is really boring and melodramatic and I see no positive progression from Black Sails to this album, as there was with all the other albums. If anything, it shows a sharp degression. If you're not ready to put out more material, DON'T PUT OUT ANOTHER ALBUM. To be honest, I expected a lot more from a band like AFI. What happened to the energy? Why is Davey taking this whole Goth/Misfits/spooky image so far? What the .... is going on here? Why is AFI doing ...... 80's metal ballads (the last song). This album is just embarrassing. Don't buy it. It sounds like the offspring mixed with 80's metal."
1,dont buy this.,"i wish i could give AFI 0 stars. all they make i s meaningless goth rock, while claiming to be ""hardcore"". just a bunch of pussies with makeup."
5,Great CD,"The Art of Drowning is more punk than hardcore. It's very melodic, and probably their softest CD to date. Not that it's a soft CD by any means though. The lyrics on this CD are very poetic, even more so than on Black Sails. Davey's singing is better than ever (but still not as good as on Sing the Sorrow). My favourite songs are the Lost Souls, Wester, and Days of the Pheonix. Get this CD! It rox!"
4,Great street punk gothic style album,"I never got into A.FI, but always been into the NYHC scene and love punk rock (Rancid, H20, Sick Of It All, Social Distortion, etc.). Thanx to Amazon, I was just on this page listening to this album the other day when I was blown away and just ran out and picked up a copy. The singers voice, I think is awesome and really distinctive. Reminds me a bit of Danzigs voice, but much more pleasent and fresh. This album i recommend for anyone that loves bands like Rancid, or H20. Actually anyone that loves good hardcore punk. The double bass on the drums are thumping along with great bass lines ( on some tracks it sounds like Matt Freeman playin the bass , it's so good). This album was worth the buy. I heard AFI's newer stuff on the radio, but it just didn't have that hardcore punk sound like this gem of an album."
5,The Best,"Anyone teetering on the brink of whether to buy this album, heed these words: BUY IT. This is not even a choice, it is a required action. This album will completely blow you away with sheer emotion and musical ability. If you have never heard AFI before, this album is a great place to start. It is not as harsh as some of their other albums (The amazing Black Sails in the Sunset and the fabulous Shut Your Mouth), but it contains some amazing songs. Even the worst song on the album, Ever and a Day, is a classic. BUY IT.....BUY IT NOW. Nothing can even come close to AFI.THROUGH OUR BLEEDING, WE ARE ONE"
4,The next step for AFI,"This is a good CD, furthering AFI's musical evolution. Everything about this album is good, the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is becuase it's not as good as Black Sails, but that was an amazng album and hard to follow up. My favorite songs on here are Sacrifice Theory (classic AFI), The Despair Factor, The Lost Souls Club, and Ever and A Day."
3,Even if all the punkers out there would like to kill me.....,"I don't know...I got nothing bad to say about AFI but I think that I don't like them.......maybe their early records are pretty good and fast and all that stuff but there's something wrong with them in this album that I can't understand.....maybe I got influenced by Fat Mike when I bought the surfer seven inch on the track Whoa the Whoas........... ""between AFI and the offspring,I don't think that anyone would say....anymore whoas,we don't whoa we're against whoas...we hate whoas"""
4,AFI goe out with a bang!,"AFI's Art of Drowning, is their last good CD in my eyes. The era before Sing the Sorrow is a different one, its dark, gloomy, but still rocks. AFI died in my eyes when Sing the Sorrow was released. But the last song, Morningstar could of been tacked onto Sing the Sorrow, and it would of been in there perfectly. Don't bother with Sing the Sorrow or DecemberUnderground (their WORST album to date). If you want to see AFI shining in their true last days, buy The Art of Drowning."
1,A.F.I. Has Completely SOLD OUT!,"Next to Sing The Sorrow this album is the biggest pile of junk this band has ever put out. To call this East Bay Hardcore is BULL. Only the little trend punks out there consider this hardcore. I can't believe they sold out this bad. They sound nothing like they good albums like Answer That, Shut Your Mouth, or Very Proud of Ya. You wanna hear good A.F.I. listen to those albums. This and Sing The Sorrow are a disgrace to the hardcore scene."
1,what the hell is this,THIS ALBUM IS A JOKE. Buying it will be a waste of your time and money. I am a meth fan and was really disappointed with this album and was mad i spent money on it.
2,we waited 6 years for this!!!!,"This is easily one of the worst albums of 2004. The single is cool but thats where it stops. Every song on here is some weak attempt to appeal to the commercial fans. The only other decent song on here is ""the turn"" which has been on the net a year before this album dropped. Meth was originally going to have puff do this album, maybe he should of! At least he might of went platinum with a garbage album. Meth you say you say you dont get enough respect in the game, I wonder why!"
2,Sleep on it,"I preordered the cd back in May, and think its fair to say I shoulda saved my money. With the exception of The Motto (track 5) and Turn (track 7), theres hardly a listenworthy track. This may not be Meth's fault from what I hear, something about def jam wanting a more commercial type record, but its still a weak effort. His cameos seem stale except for Raekwons, and who knows what missy, busta, or snoop dogg are doing on his tape. Track 5 and 7 sound like some of the older wu solo tracks, which I think are the only songs worth listening. Do yourself a favor and just download those two and skip the rest."
2,Number of Guest,"Method Man had a number of guest artist-Raekwon,Redman,Busta Rhymes,Missy,and Ludacris there were some good songs but there were many that were very bad and should not be on any album they are all Filler is there a badder artist right now then Missy Elliott.There are a few good joints on here such as""What's Happinin"",""Motto"" and ""Tease"" but there is not enough power to save this album remember Tical-The OriginalLyrics-5/10 Production-4/10 X Factor-2/10 Classic-5/10 Replay-4Total=4 out of 10 Fingers not recommended"
2,POOR!! meth need to stay to tv shows,"Meth's needs to leave rap albums alone, this album had me so pissed. its weak, the intro has the beest beat, with rza saying how wu is together and praising meth i guess the intro was recorded b4 the album. Meth needs to listen to Masta Killa's No Said Date, and pretty tony, cuz he has no clue whats he doing."
3,Method Man Lost some Talent,"14 years ago, Method Man's debut album, ""Tical"" became one of my favorite albums ever. And now hearing this album, I see that Method Man has lost alot of his talent. I liked a few songs like Say What, and Act Rite, but the rest of them I didn't seem to like. Tical is a much better album. It was from 14 years ago, but I can't believe how much skill Method Man has lost. I suggest you pass buying this album."
3,SOlid effort,Okay maybe its wasn't what I expect but method man did his thing.My favorite cut on there is the motto which is blaze like john blaze.Raekwon and ghostface bless the album like I expected them to and don't sleep on the busta rhymes joint.Could have been better beats but alright effort from method man.
3,could have been great,"I really wish that 10 or more RZA produced track could have made it to the CD as Meth wanted but Def Jam are idiots and didn't put them out even though meth's contact says RZA can produce his tracks. The track with Busta and Meth and the second track are a few of the good tracks. The missy elliot appearance was just sad. The RZA track ""the turn"" and afterparty were the only other good tracks."
2,"I dont usually write reviews, but...","I am being very very very generous with my rating, as this album was, sorry to say Mr.Mef, garbage. I can't believe that after all this waiting we get 16 tracks, out of which a couple are what I listen to, and those are even.. eeeeh.It seems that The Jonny Blaze, has become too much hollywood, and lost his thirst. I remember the first album was dope, and the second one was amazing, regardless to what some people said, I thought his sophomre effort was amazing, I still bump those two albums till this day, they havent left my car, unfortunatly the third album will be collecting dust for a long long time."
2,A pretty poor album.,"The phrase 'coulda been better' comes to mind... Some nice songs on it, and Method Man is a great MC but this isn't his best work, and a lot of the beats are annoying and make the album hard to listen to. Method Man isnt BAD on this album, its just he can do better, and there's too many guest features on it. Does have some nice tracks, but you're better off just downloading the better songs of iTunes if you're a Method Man fan.I'd recommend the original Tical album as a better display of Method Man's skills, or Ghostface's 'The Pretty Toney Album' as a better Def Jam/Wu-Tang release released around the same time as this album.Top 5 Songs:The Afterparty feat. GhostfaceWhat's Happening feat. Busta RhymesThe Turn feat. RaekwonThe ShowSay What feat. Missy Elliot"
1,supreme garbage,"its like aliens abducted the real method man. his subject matter is nil, production sounds like some timbaland/p. diddy keyboard bull. what is even the point of this album? it doesnt even sound like method man, or any of his prior albums. maybe all of the sitcoms and tv appearances have finally gotten to him.... i wish there were 0 stars, method man has disgraced his former self in a distasteful manner."
1,Most anticipated crap of the year,"Crap, Crap, Crap, Crap, Crap, This is all i have to say, How could one of the sickest MC's put his name on this."
1,Are you kidding me?,"Is this a sick joke method man?? is this the album we have been waiting six long years for?? Have you and Ghostface completely lost touch with your fans?? 2004 has been a sad, sad year for the WU, and it doesn' appear to be getting any better. There are only a few songs on this album even worth mentioning, The prequel, the motto, the turn...everything else is underproduced crap. the hooks are weak, the beats are weaker, and the guest appearances and poor variety of producers simply ruined this album. I am so dissappointed in Method Man for releasing this album. Where's the dark, gritty, TALENTED MC that we all know? I simply do not know how it could get any worse than this!! MISSY, LUDA, and PUFFY on your album?? Oh please!! This is definetly the last and most dissapointing WU tang album i will ever buy."
3,the realist,i give it 3 stars because meths got lyrics and the 1 track produce by rza .called the turn ft. reakwon.
1,Very Disappointed,"Method Man disappointed me A LOT on this album. I kept waiting for it to get good and it never did. I used to be a big fan of Method Man and Redman. This album has turned me off to them. I was highly disappointed. I really didn't like any song on the whole album, and most of them were just unbearable! I'm sorry Meth, you gotta do better!"
2,a bunch of crap with missy elliot sitting on top of it,"Tical Q is a waster of money, the only track that made me give this cd two stars is what's happening, thanks to busta but the rest of the cd is horrible. Missy elliot should stop rapping, if you can call it that. From now on she should decline every invitation to feature on someone's album because she f***in sucks! And meth lets not have a sequel to the prequel P.S. I hope your show is better!!"
2,Not Being A Hater..,"Okay, this album was too commercial. The only good tracks were ""The Turn"" feat. Raekwon (the best track), ""We Some Dogs"" feat. Redman and Snoop Dogg (good collabo), ""Afterparty"" feat. Ghostface (Ghostface comes tight) and ""What's Happenin'"" (first single, good callabo and dope). The rest were average, not so good or garbage. Every song had a different producer, and why so many guests (not from the Wu-Tang???)? I know RZA is busy and all, but if he could've produced every song on this album, it would've been better, for sure. I'm not hating, I've been a Wu-Tang fan for a long time, and I know this isn't Method Man at his best. This album deserves 2/2.5 stars."
1,Another Reason to Download Music,"I'm glad i didn't waste a penny on this piece of crap. With the push of my delete button, I am rid of this filth. ""Sell out"" is a severe understatement here. I waited so long for this album. Don't look for any Release yo Delf's or Judgement Day's here. Even coming from the p. diddy school of hip-hop this is phenomenally bad."
3,Decent but not on same level,"This CD is ok, but not what you expect from Meth. The main difference between this and Tical, Tical 2000, and Blackout, not to mention all the Wu albums, is all the ""made for MTV"" tracks. I never thought I'd see Meth sell out to move units but I'm afraid this album definately leans that directions. There are some dope songs, #7 is my personal favorite and the one with Ghost is tight, but there's just too many pop sounding tracks, not to mention Missy Elliot. Far from his best work."
2,meth was alright,I like all meths verses in there cept the beats and whoever he is working with i wish i could get this album with all the extra ppl on mute meth is not bad in here
2,Method of Laziness,Method Man is back and worse than ever. This is obviously not a proquel. The lyrical mastermind has finally jumped the shark. A sad time for the Wu-Tang!
2,Dissapointing.,"After hearing he 12"" with ""Whats Happening"" and ""the Motto"" I was sure this album would be great. But after listening to the album its clear that ""whats happening"" and ""the motto"" are the two best tracks on the album. The main problem with the album isn't meth's lyrics... it the production. It just sucks on most tracks."
2,WORST METHOD MAN album!!!,"Okay this is by far the worst METHOD MAN album! If you liked TICAL, TICAL2000, BLACKOUT or any Classic WU TANG release you will not like this album. There are maybe 3-5 good tracks and one classic track being ""afterparty"", the rest it total pop garbage. The lyrics and beats have been dumbed down to suit the current state of Hip Hop in 2004, Alot of party/thugs-in-love tracks that the once grimey METHOD MAN should be ashamed for doing. There are too many cheesy guest appearences by the likes of PUFF DADDY, MISSEY, LUDACRISS, CHINKY, and BUSTA, that are aimed at attracting the 12 year old mall girl market, not the hip hop head. There is nothing CUTTING EDGE OR FRESH about this album. Method Man no longer sounds dope with his lyrics, and after waiting 6 YEARS this album is a major dissapointment for METHOD MAN and WU TANG fans."
1,What happened yao?,I used 2 think that METH was the BRUCE LEE of hip hopNow he's turned in2 the Bruce Springsteen of flip flop (:<)http://cdbaby.com/cd/taki76
1,Oh man........this is just horrible. What happened!,"I am a huge Wu Tang fan, and have listened to their collabo albums, as well as their solo releases.I have news for everyone, Method Man has fallen off.........HARD. This is his second wack album in a row. But amazingly enough, this album is FAR worse than his last.If you want to listen to good Method Man music, just buy the original Tical. It is far too depressing to listen to this album, what a waste of talent.NOTE TO ALL WU TANG MEMBERS. Get RZA to produce every single track, without him YOU ARE NOTHING."
1,Five years for this?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!,"First, I am a hardcore meth fan, until now. I got excited with the intro, a gritty old-school Wu jumpoff, then the next song was gritty, and getting me more excited...and thats where the entire album should have stopped. This is the most disappointing thing that Meth could have done. I can't believe that it took him five years to make this miserable piece of junk. I hope that there will be a good follow up to this, but I won't be holding my breath. Also, why is P diddy on the album? It seems that he is the exact opposite of everything that the Wu is, him being on the album just feels like a huge sellout. Well Meth has the series coming on fox, hopefully his acting only gets better, cuz obviously his music is getting worse. I guess I at least have a new coaster for my coffee table."
2,Meth...What Happened?,"Im a huge Wu-Tang supporter since they first came out. Meth is one of my fav. member, but i don't know what happened in this album. To tell you the truth he didn't give it his all. Meth is a really creative person, but he was creative enough for this album. The beats are boring and the lyrics are just alright. Honestly the only song i liked are ""The Turn"" this song is def. 5 stars. Some alright songs that might catch peoples attention are ... ""The Show"" ""Who Ya'll Rollin Wit"" ""Crooked Letter I"" ""Baby Come on"" ""Say What"" and ""Whats Happenin"". Those songs are somewhat stand out tracks for the commercial fans, but personally those songs aren't my flavor. The other ok song in my eye is ""Afterparty"". But for the most part the cd is terrible, No disrespect Meth. is very talented but not on this album."
3,poor effort poor album,"The previous review from indo was correct.No one should contribute to their profits, although,I did, sadly with Tical 0. They ARE broken up- o.d.b. is officially out of the clan, they cut his lyrics out from track# 11, and put someone else on there. When ones' out, the group can no longer be. Why is this called The prequel? What signifigance is there refering to this title IN THE ENTIRE LP? I would have to say AfterParty and Turn are the best tracks, The quest appearances from Luda and Missy prove that the ex-members of Wu Tang Clan are going mainstream and commercial. This album reaks with Dej Jams hand."
2,Call him Cold Nix instead of Hot Nix,"I just listened to the whole cd from beginning to end, and I'm dissapointed, but not alot because I wasn't expecting alot from Method Man on this CD. One of my main complaints is why in the **** do the good songs such as #7 and #15 barely last 3 minutes, while his ""garbage"" songs, such as #11, last for 4 1/2 minutes!!!!!! The M-E-T-H-O-D Man has definitely went commercial....in other words he pulled what I call an ""Ice Cube"".Yall remember the ""old"" Ice Cube before all the movies and how nobody on the west couldn't touch him. Thats how Meth was, but sadly we may never see the ""old"" Meth again. On a good note #7 is str8 FIRE!!!!!! but too d*mn short. Buy this CD from a used CD joint....there are probably some at a used CD store already."
3,Doesn't sound like a WU album,"This is definitely not what were use to hearing from Johnny Blaze, Ticallion Stallion, Meth we are use to. There are still some hot tracks on here. CD tracks 3,4,7,8,15 should give u suthin to bop ur head."
1,Steamin Pile of...,"This album right here was a total bust, not because of Method Man's rhymes ( they never fell off) but because of the wack beats he rhymes over. Some of the beats border unlistenable. His beat selection is worse than Nas & Jadakiss combined. Wack production. Method Man keeps his usual velvet flow and wit on this album and even gets some interesting wordplay and metaphors in there but they are overlooked becuase of terrible beats and it's a shame. After hearing 'What's Happening' I expected this album to be a surefire banger...boy was I wrong. THe only songs I'm feelin are What's Happening, Say waht, The Motto, The Turn, and AfterParty after that cut the deck. This album is not worth any of your time."
4,"A little Wu, A little Commercial but for '04 it is Nice","Bangin,4 or 5 tight songs. More than you expact for today's artist. Some of the Rymes are kind of bubble gum like Timberland and Magoo. Did not take much to come up with that corney Dog song with Snoop. All in All it splits ya head like an one eye."
2,Didn't live up to the hype,"i love Method Man and hes still sick lyrical wise, but this album really lacks in beats, and there are way too many quest appearances that shouldn't be on here. Meth also kinda of lost his hard own delevery lyrical wise, hes gone soft rapping about women in such. Oh yeah its not THAT bad, buts its diaspointing"
3,could've been better,"i thought Mef was good on this album, but the beats were kinda weak. there were a few tracks i really liked but not enough for a full 5 stars."
3,M.E.T.H.O.D. Man,"it has been a while since we've had a method man album out. How High soundtrack was good, so was Blackout! But, even though this album isn't the greatest, we needed another MEF album. It's worth a listen. It doesn't even match up w/ Tical (Mef's 1st and best album) but it's good. Hopefully Mef will release other stuff in the next few years, and, hopefully, his next cd will be better.......bring back The RZA!(...)"
2,Ehhh...,"I was really looking forward to this CD, with guest spots from Busta Rhymes, Snoop, and Ludacris. My first impression is that I'm kinda dissapointed. Method Man is really lacking in things to talk about, has the same flow on every song, and uses a lot of connectors that I've heard before. The beats are definately below average and some are even just plain weird. Also, I have yet to find a single track that just completely bangs. Some are better than others, but there are no real standouts. Maybe the CD will grow on me, but with the poor production and lack of lyrical content, I doubt it."
2,Not what I was expecting,"After seeing the video with Busta, I thought ""yeah, this is gonna do it."" Meth is finally gonna bring it like we always knew he could. But for, real, the single is about the only song I'm really feeling on the CD. There a bunch of hot tracks though but, for me, the single is the only one where it all comes together nicely."
1,GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Ayo this album is straight up garbage I expected so much more from meth espeacially since he had 2 years to make this. Big up to the t-dot bois on the album (Kardinal and Saukratees). I hope this is not the down fall of meth but if he continues to put out this sold out music he will be another emcee gon' whack.T-Dot What!Ez
3,I was expecting more...,"I got this from 2 weeks, and what I'm going to say is that i'm a little dissapointed... It's not that this is weak or something, but when you getting new Meth you're expecting new quality with same old groove. What we got here is still same old groove without new quality. What's more, I wouldn't expected that Meth, who is a big person on HipHop industry have to invite so much guests to make his record. over 15 guests on 17 tracks? Give me a break... Even on his single (with Busta) he rhymes less than his guest! Absurd, and really sad, that someone who is on the scene for long time, can't hold on his own all track. The other things that bother me is beats, it's not a standart 2004 top production, it sounds rather like made by 3rd category producers. But hey, it;s still same old Meth:)"
1,GARBAGE -PLAIN AND SIMPLE,"Funny that these guys call themselves ""Producers"" when they busy stealing beats (Whats Happening) from 1960's Indian MoviesI guess the well really has run dry . This CD sucks along with every sample that these beat stealing #$$^&%*^* decide to use and call there own TICAL---MY AZZ!"
1,what the?,this album is nominated by me for the worst thing that ever happened this year for music. The lyrics seemed to be written by a four year old who is retarded. I've lost faith in Method man after this album
4,This is a Good Album...Bad Reviews!!!,"I was very hesitant before I bought this CD cuz I had read the reviews here on CDNOW.com. One thing I noticed when I bought the album though (and I LOVE all of Meth's earlier stuff too) is that this album isn't terrible at all.. the beats are catchy (not as old school as I had hoped they be, but thats life) and the rhymes are good. Mostly all of the rhymes off of the original Tical cd stuck in my head, not so much in Tical 2000 (my least favourite Meth album) and did it again in Tical 0...so I don't know what these people are talking about. Meth has still got his game, and his flow has improved SOOO much since Enter the 36 Chambers & Tical...Truth is, only a couple of the songs are mediocre, and you can tell on first listen, but the majority of the tracks are top-knotch and this album is definetly worth the buy. Busta Rhymes, Redman, Snoop Dogg & Ludacris all have worthwhile verses as well."
4,REALLY AINT THAT BAD,"Iight i know that some of yall dont like this album.... but i thought i wasnt that bad ... I think it was pretty good album.. nothing compared to tical and Liquid Swords but If you A WU Fan ... deFfinatly Kop This albumThe Turn,Whats Happenin and The AfterParty are the best tracks"
2,Confused.,"Consider me an ignorant reader, but I was not familiar with the author untill now. I have a set of 5 books written by him, in a large lot I received. The Robe, being one of them, I assumed the foundational thinking of the author would be Christian.Though it began in a very hostile way toward Christianity, it had the feel of a story with a twist in the works, so I wadded on. The continual heartfelt and subposedly intellectual knocks on the foundations of the Bible made me feel like I was sitting in the classroom of an aggresive, atheistic college professor. The profanity, though considered mild by today's standards, was nontheless gratuitous.Though the humanitarian personality won out in the end, it was a hard fought battle that left the dessimated bodies of theology in it's unworthy wake.I give it 2 out of 5 stars, for a some what interesting read but am shocked that this is the work of a respected minister capable of a work such as The Robe."
3,NOT FOR THE CHILDREN,TIS IS A GREAT DISC IF YOU LIKE VULGARITY. THE SONGS ARE FUNNY BUT I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT FOR YOUR KIDS.
4,Another Legend Disappears,"This CD is the first of two ""Legends of Acid Jazz"" titles showcasing organist Jack McDuff (the other isBrother Jack, see my review). While these twelve tracks all feature the quartet of McDuff, Red Holloway on tenor sax, George Benson on guitar and Joe Dukes on drums (though the last three cuts also add a big band, arranged by Benny Golson), and they were all recorded in July 1964, the collection has a bit of a scattered feel. That may be why this material was originally spread out over six LPs, but overall it does give a good overview of this fabulous soul jazz player. Interested parties should act fast as the entire ""Legends of Acid Jazz"" line is being deleted, along with seemingly half of the Fantasy/OJC catalog -- legends indeed."
3,Well what should I say?,"Being a musician myself I must admit it's a musician's album but others would like it as well. But if one would ask me if this is original music, my answer would be not at all.The song Chi Town reminds me very much to a song written by Simon Phillips on one of his solorecords with Andy Timmons on guitar. As I can say of other songs too. F.i. Hidden treasure has many simularities to SP's work.Over all it's a nice album to hear but if you're looking for something more original then I would suggest ""keep on searching""."
5,My favorite,This is a well done graphic novel. It is my favorite along side of Batman. I find the story to be very interesting and I love the biblical/Christian references. My only difficulty is that it is not in the main stream and often Witchblade is not produced efficiently. I have always loved this title and volume 10 does not disappoint.
3,Good ideas- be preapred to work like an Egyptian slave!,"I got this volume to get some ideas on swale construction and drainage for the backyard. I am good with a shovel and wheelbarrow, so I figured that I could find some projects to work on.I did find projects, but they aren't for the faint of heart. Example: many tasks require enough digging that an average homeowner would need some serious free time, a crew of ten small, rugged boys, or a very convenient backhoe rental to complete landscaping in a timely fashion.The author has a great style and is clearly knowledgeable and experienced. However, I was hoping for a little bit more DYI and a little bit less of a reason for inviting all my friends over for digging parties every Saturday. They would come maybe twice...."
4,"Great, Easy to Read Garden Reference","This is a well written, practical little book, with more concrete landscaping information than the many 100's of other garden books I've read. Totally indispensable for the northwest garden, I'm sad to see that it's already out of print."
1,absurd,"i was looking for a good scary ghost story book. instead, i find nonsense theories about physics from someone who know just enough to be completely wrong!"
3,not the best,"This has some good selections but really doesn't have the best because it is so subjective. i certainly got bored with many of the pieces they selected in the group, while others had my foot stomping. i recommend getting the original stuff anyways."
4,Great for a road trip,"This man is funny! I wouldn't listen to him over and over. He points out the differences between men and women very well and his comedy is intuitive. Most of his material is down to earth and easy to understand. My wife likes him, and she is tough cookie when it comes to comedy."
2,specialty thermometer not useful for me,My new toyota lacks an indoor/outdoor thermometer so I thought I might use this to check temperature. I am obviously not too knowledgeable as I needed an ambient thermometer not an infrared. I sent it back.
1,BenQ support,"We purchased a BenQ PB 6100 projector. If the overall quality of the projector is fine, such is not the case of the lamp which blew up in less than 6 weeks!!! and worse BenQ does NOT honor their international guarantee and the support center does not respond to the emails for exchanging the lamp (priced 400$!). Overall a very poor support. My last Boxlight lamp is still running after 4 years. This was my first BenQ but surely the last. A strong suggestion, Don't buy BenQ."
3,Beware if you have win98,"I bought Orinoco silver for my Sony Vaio (win98)to work with the LinkSys's wireless router. I got this one instead of Linksys's own pc card because reviews say it has much better range. It took some effort for me to get this pc card installed. On the first attempt, I lost video, and I took the card out of the slot and got the video back but lost mouse and keyboard control. I called tech support (the most knowledge tech support I've ever talked to!), they immediately recognized the problem and told me to upgrade my BIOS or upgrade to win2000 -- even though Orinoco says that it's win98 compatible. The BIOS upgrade from Sony website didn't work, so I upgraded to win2000 (not a very easy task on a Sony Vaio). After the upgrade, I got the card working with my LinkSys with little effort. Signal strength adaquate to go one floor down without sacrifice in speed."
2,Couldn't get it to work,"I have a Linksys wireless 4-port cable/DSL router which works well with a Cisco Aironet PC card. Unfortunately, the Orinoco card I bought would never talk properly with the Linksys. Neither the Orinoco (Agere/Proxima) tech support people nor the Linksys tech support people could get them to work together. This card may work well with other access points, but not with this Linksys unit."
4,"Idolatry, hardening of the heart",The book is a well disciplined treatment of Biblical theology regarding the first two commandments.
3,Data is over 30 years old.,"A great book and still very relevant, but somewhat outdated. The idea behind the book is the medical profession is riddled with problems and that these problems are, for the most part, swept under the rug. However, this book was published in 1979 and most of the data sighted is from 1970 and before. The author also shows quite a bit of bias against the medical industry and shows this bias more than a realistic view of medical practices.I would like to see the book updated before I would recommend it to anyone. As I said, it's a good premise, but a bit out of date."
4,great seller,"Very very good communication. Despite having an unexpected hospital stay, got my item shipped to me and stayed in communication until I received it. The book was in great condition as described. I'd definitely do business again. Thanks so much!"
1,Unbalanced sensationalism.,"I disagreed with Mendelsohn 21 years ago, and I disagree now. There are just as many patients who want drugs and surgery. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics from their overuse is one result. Most of us don't know Latin and much of physicians' perceived power has been taken over by corporate medicine. There is a lot wrong with the medical profession, but a lot that is right, including the ability to save someone's sorry skin after years of abusing one's body."
5,Learn about the battle going on,"""A hospital is like a war"" Here you have it from a doctor who has been there and done that. As he describes the things that go on in a hospital it is amazing that anyone comes out alive. It does not surprise we when they are several people I personally know who have gotten very ill in a hospital from something COMPLETELY unrelated to why they entered. This book needs to be read by all."
5,A must read for medical students!,"I read this book a long time ago and have recently picked it up again. I'm impressed at how true to life the pictures it presents still are. It should be read by everyone thinking about entering the medical profession, as it provides a very critical poit of view about what is taught and practiced in hospitals."
5,A True Classic,"I first heard ""A Songwriter's Point of View"" in 1993 and immediately fell in love with the high energy of this CD. Donald Lawrence led the Tri-City Singers with true style and grace and I felt God on many of the songs. My favorites are ""You Encourage my Soul"", ""The Mender"" and Miracles. With help from Stephanie Mills and Peabo Bryson, Donald created a true masterpiece that is still a ""must-have"" for today."
5,Everything I expected and so much more,"I discovered the sounds of Wayne McGhie of a San Diego radio show. Long after the song 'Cool It' had been played it was looped on my brain. Those summery horns, soulful vocals and sublime instrumentation had weaved its way into my subconsiousness. This albums is a find, buy it now!"
5,A must have! Very enlightening!!!!,"I ordered Heirs Together, last year while experiencing difficulties in my marriage. When I retrieved the book from the mailbox I immediately opened it and could not put it down! It is very easy to read and understand. I recommend this book for anyone who is married or contemplating marriage. Since reading ""Heirs Together"" I have purchased multiple copies to share with friends and family. I encourage everyone to get this book it offeres both hope and shares God's plan for marriage. You will not go wrong with this book. There is hope for your marriage, Open your heart and receive what God has to say thru the pen of Mac Hammond.I am grateful to Dr. Jesse Duplantis for praying for me and writing me a letter of encouragement and refering me to Mac Hammond Ministries.Encouraged Wife,"
5,Baghdad Burning II - More Girl Blog from Iraq,"I actually read Riverbend's blog as she wrote it. After she moved to Syria, her writing stopped, so I was glad to be able to get her second book. I hope she and her family moved on to a different safe place! I really grew to love Riverbend like a granddaughter and wish her and her entire family well. I also wish most people could read both of her books."
1,Poor little rich loser,"Riverbend is a young Sunni female that writes from the perspective of hating the loss of Sunni power and privilege. She indicates this with her contempt for the Iraqi elections and the new Shia dominated government. She frequently complains of losing the good old days when her family benefited from Saddam Hussein's brutal dictatorship.Riverbend now talks of having to leave Iraq (she is a supporter of the terrorists in Iraq) and going to either Jordan or Syria. She hints that this is just a ""stopover"" on her way to another place. No doubt she is considering moving to the United States that she hates so much. Riverbend is an enemy of the United States and should be prevented from visiting the U.S. or any coalition country."
4,Up Jumped the Devil,"Vivid descriptions, gritty and realistic dialogue, action to spare and a protagonist who's real, not Superman. There's a lot to like about this book and given that I'm not one who reads every author out there, it takes one who's extra-ordinary to keep me enthralled. For me, ""Up Jumped the Devil"" was cinematic. As one who worships at the church of Panavision, that's my highest complement. Highest recommendations and I'm looking forward to more from Blair Walker."
1,Must be two books with the same title,"The Amazon reviews for a book titled ""Up Jumped the Devil"" must surely be referring to another book with the same title. The one I read was a very weak effort by an author seeming to act out his own fantasies about life as a crime reporter. I only hope the author's career as a reporter produced more clear writing than he was able to produce in this uninteresting, predictable book."
4,Great story,"A great story line along a familiar theme around a sadistic killer, a crime fighting reporter and of course a heroine. I found this a bit over done on the racial issues in America between black and white in the workplace. I think the author was pushing his own particular barrow in this regard but it didnt spoil a good well written read. I will read more by this author."
2,Up jumped the Devil.,"I just couldn't get into it. You know sometimes when it becomes a burden, not worth the time. Others may like it, but really wasn't what I had expected."
2,Up Jumped The Devil,"This wasn't something I would enjoy, my husband ordered it for me so he will read it. The story is not what I like."
3,"Not a bad first book at all, Mr. Walker.","I read the mystery as part of a Black Literature discussion group here in suburban Maryland, outside DC. Good story. Humor. Action doesn't fade when the events begin to come together in the denouement. I identified with Darryl Billups more than I did with Easy Rollins in Walter Mosely's ""Devil in a Blue Dress"", although the latter had a better story line. Since our discussion group quickly got off the subject of Walker's book, I missed the opportunity to talk about the newspaper journalist's life, and places and scenes mentioned in the story about Baltimore. I will read Mr. Walker's next work as well."
4,A fast moving read,"I was pleasantly surprised by this book and looked for more by the author. It is a fast moving story with well developed characters and keeps the readers interest to the end. I don't usually like reading dialects but this book manages to use it appropriately and not to irritate the reader.The book gives a perspective on black/white relations in the US and, particularly, in the newspaper business. This focus on newspapers also gives a general appreciation about how stories are chosen and developed. Some of it is as expected but there are some surprises.The book is a good read for men or women and shows signs of being the first of a series. If the next books are as good as this one, it will be a successful one."
3,A manly man's book,"Up Jumped the Devil by Blair S. Walker is a man's book. His character Darryl Billups is an African American reporter, which is a novel idea for a change. Darryl works for the Baltimore Herald on the police beat. He has trouble with his boss, but most of the other reporters respect his work. An anonymous phone caller starts Darryl on an adventure that leads to life-threatening danger to himself and those around him. The finale keeps your interest up to the very end. It is a must for male mystery lovers."
1,Sad but true.,"Great idea, great acting, great production value and crap directing. Unless you get excited by people sitting and talking, noting happens that's even interesting till almost 55 min. into the movie, seriously? Man I really wish this lived up to its potential, not even close. Watch something like ""Dead Snow"", or ""The Horde"" is you want a decent spin on a zombie movie. Don't bother with this mess."
3,Vegan Zombies Doesn't Suck,"I've watched this movie 3 times. Each time I watch I hear a couple more decent lines. By the 3rd time I watched I was drinking shots each time I heard one. My favorite is, ""Die you zombie slut!"" 'Nuf said."
2,I dont even know what to title this,"This movie was strange. There were witches, zombies and lesbian coeds and even they werent enough to save it. I watched from the beginning to the end and it really didnt do much for me. Vegan Zombies were more along the line of grape zombies. One fun thing about the movie was the grapes of wrath. The grapes were just very angry. Regardless, if you have nothing better to do and have some time to waste between other movies you can watch this. Otherwise it is a pass. Unfortunate too because it had a decent premise."
1,This is a bad movie.,"This movie is a poorly written, poorly directed, poorly acted,micro-budget horror film. The attempts at comedy fall incredibly flat.The plot, such as it is, takes forever to pick up, and when it finallydoes things just get worse.With a name like ""Attack of the Vegan Zombies!"" it's obvious that thefilm does not take itself too seriously. However, even with that inmind this movie fails on every level.The special effects are laughable, character motivation jumps randomlyfrom one scene to the next, the comic relief is forced and unfunny, thehorror elements are clichéd and not even remotely frightening.The positive reviews posted here that suckered me into believing thatthis was potentially a clever horror spoof must be written by peopleinvolved with the film. You have been warned."
5,A Most Enjoyable Surprise!,"What's this? A subdued Sonny Stitt?! Impossible - or so I thought until I heard this CD. It's a compilation of two Prestige LPs, both with organ: SOUL SHACK (1963) and NIGHT LETTER (1969). On both recordings Stitt goes out of his way to play pretty; not gutless or bland, but pretty. SOUL SHACK, the tune, is a terrific 12-bar blues taken up tempo, and Sonny just skips over the changes as lightly as could be. HAIRY is another relaxed blues, taken at medium tempo. The second half of the CD features Stitt on Varitone (an electrified tenor) and when I saw that I expected the worst, but I was pleasantly surprised. In fact, most of the time it's hard to tell he's playing an altered horn at all, and he does no tricks with it. Gene Ludwig is on organ on these sides, and he plays with a great deal of soulful feeling. There is not a single misstep on the entire CD. Excellent!"
4,Karcher Trigger Gun,"Bought the Karcher 91120140 Trigger Gun for my Karcher pressure washer. Thought it would be easier to order a replacement part on-line than run around town trying to find one to fit. The item was perfect, looked just like the original, except that the front thread end of the gun was male instead of female. Therefore, it didn't attach to my spray wand. I had to go to Home Depot and buy a double QD fitting to make the connection. While there I looked at their replacement wands. Now I know it would have been cheaper and easier to just buy a universal wand from HD."

4,Funky Organ Music,"The Legends of Acid Jazz series reissued a lot of albums that have long been out of print. Recorded on the Prestige label, the group(s) featured on this Leon Spencer compilation include Melvin Sparks (guitar), and Idris Mohammed (drums). Both these musicians have albums of their own in the same series. Each of these volumes include two original lp's from the late 60's to mid-70's. In this case, as is most often the case with the Legends of Acid Jazz releases, the first album is better than the second. Still, both have great beats, good soloing, and feature generally inspired playing. The lay out of this series is awful. Cartoonish and tacky, whoever put the graphics together should have used the original album covers. The title of this series should be changed as well. If one didn't know what one was looking at, this would seem like a risky purchase."
3,"Sadly, not up to par","I've very much enjoyed the first books in the Cadfael series, but this one fell way short of my expectations. I guessed the plot twist very early on and from that point the story seemed rather cardboard and the characters flat. Maybe Peters had run out of steam for this concept? I'll still check out the other books in the series, but I wouldn't recommend this one."
3,A Medieval Type A Personality,"In this, the sixteenth volume in the Brother Cadfael mystery series, Ellis Peters focuses on one of the less attractive customs of medieval life. Brother Haluin, a monk of Shrewsbury, takes an ill-considered vow to make a penitential pilgrimage in reparation for a long-ago sin. His vow-and the extremes to which he goes in fulfilling it-have less to do with Christian teaching about sin and repentance than about stubbornness, control and what today we might call a Type A personality. The modern reader may wonder about the mindset in which an abbot could approve such a fanatical exercise, but our difficulty is at least moderated when Brother Cadfael is sent along to keep things under control. Mysteries abound as the journey unfolds, and uncharacteristically in this series, the alert reader can understand one key clue before Brother Cadfael sees its significance."
3,A long time to a death,"When you can see some of what is coming at you for pages in a mystery, then it is not doing what it should be doing. This is the problem I found with The Confession of Brother Haluin. Previously when Peters has sent Hugh Beringar to court then we have court intrigue find its way to Shrewbury.This time, we do not. We find very little in the way of additional detail about Saint Peter and St. Paul's though we do hear about the brothers who work in the scriptorium as that is where Haluin has found his skills to be valued.As we delve into the story, we see so much earlier than Cadfael what is taking place, that it leaves me wondering why the story was even written. Then the body. All good mysteries are murder mysteries and so there must be a body.But we don't get to the body for such a long time, and by then we know the heart of the mystery so the motive for there being a body is too evident.The reason to read the story is to pass time and keep up with the rest of the series."
4,An element of romance as well as religious devotion!,"Peters isn't Shakespeare, but she does know how to hook you in. I could see quite clearly Brother Haluin dragging his failing body over miles and miles to atone for his sins, and gentle and wise Brother Cadfael putting all the pieces together (both physical and intellecutal) to make sense of the journey. Peters has a wonderful grasp of human emotions in this book, and draws a very clear picture of Medieaval monastic life with its limitations and its glories, making us feel as though we fit right in even though it's 800 years later. I want to hang out with Cadfael and hoist a glass of ale or two with this warm, compassionate and clever monk."
1,Kindle please!,Is anyone else sick of audible audio editions as the ONLY digital format available for certain books? I really DO NOT LIKE books to be read to me - I want to be able to read these books myself on my Kindle!
4,Share The Guess Who,"On the heels of their number one hit and breakout, American Woman, founding member and songwriter, Randy Bachman left the band to form Bachman-Turner Overdrive. He was replaced by Kurt Winter and together with lead singer Burton Cummings, they fashioned the most socially conscious album of the band's career. Songs like ""Hand Me Down World"", ""Hang On To Your Life"", ""Bus Rider"", ""Coming Down Off The Moneybag"" & ""Moan For You Joe"" all deal with the state of the world in 1970. The title track is the best song on the album and it has an anthem-like sound with Mr. Cummings laying it out there."

5,Read-a-holic,"I loved the suspense element in this book. Althought it's geared towards young adults, adults will love it as well. I recommend this book to all mystery and suspense readers."
5,A 19th Century Tale that Could Have Taken Place in 2008,"I bought this book based on a Newsweek recommended reading list. It concerns greed, pursuit of position, and fraud in late 19th century London, but most of the story line reads as if it could have been set in 2008, during the financial scandals on Wall Street. There is even a Bernard Madoff type figure in the story. There is also a BBC/PBS adaptation available on DVD. It is also excellent, but necessarily lacks some of the richness of detail that we find in the book. I don't think of Tollope's books as page turners, but I got to a point where I didn't want to put this down. Perhaps in a few years the material won't seem as fresh, but right now it's very timely."
4,The Way We Live Now,"Hard going with many despicable characters, and a few upright characters - but worth following through to the end. Values in the making."
4,Best Yet,"This is the fifth of Trollope's novels I have read and easily the best so far. It does not fall within any of his series but a few familiar characters breeze in and out if you are familiar with some of the other books. This novel in particular for me (along with Trollope generally) has been very useful in my ongoing study of humanity, and particularly women, who I believe Trollope has a rare deftness of touch with, unusual for a 19th century male writer. I have read somewhere that Trollope felt his romantic subplots were somewhat tacked-on to the political or business action in his novels, but in this novel in particular I cannot allow him to make such a claim - it is the best among his novels for descriptions of human feelings and I enjoyed it very much for that."
4,Are you sure this was not written about Wall Street today?,"""The Trillion Dollar Meltdown"" by Charles Morris mentions this book and I; a bit of an adventuresome sort thought I would read it.I found the book charming to a fault; I was completely enamoured with the characters; and enjoyed the book immensely.During the entire book tho, I could not help but remind myself that had it not been for the classical style of the writing itself, one would think this book had been written about America's financial industry at present.Definately a great read, and highly recommended that one place it on the Summer Reading schedule.My only complaint is the number of bl&tant; typographical errors, which at times made reading a tad difficult and humourous."
5,The emotional depth of this novel is severly underrated,"Everyone of course focuses on the pitch perfect portrayal of political, economic and cultural corruption as it existed then and as it exists in only slightly modified manifestation now, but because no one commits suicide (with one exception), goes insane, goes into lifetime seclusion, dies of horrible diseases, or starves to death it often seems to be suggested that this story lacks emotional force and psychological depth. I don't share this feeling at all; to my mind some of the portrayals of people trying to find happiness and being thwarted by circumstances, social mores, their own natures and other people compares very well with Austin or Bronte."
4,I beg to differ!,"Did I read the same book as the two previous reviewers? This HISTORICAL romance covers the last period of the war of Independence. It was full of the grit, exhaustion and triumph of both the revolutionary army and the protagonists themselves. War is hell but love endures. I found this to be a moving, engrossing story which I didn't want to end. No vapid Regency this. Good job Jane!"
1,This one is not worth reading.,"I bought this book second-hand, thank goodness. I have read a few chapters and will not continue. This is simply trash. The characters are not worth the time. As another reviewer said, this time period is interesting, but this book is not. It does not ring true and the people are boring."
4,When Angels Dream 2,"When Angels Dream 2 is pretty good for meditation background music. For background music while computer programming, I prefer Davol, Mark Dwane, and Lorellei."
5,"So you are very smart ... don't worry, you have hope!","No matter who you are, thinking is a skill that you can improve.This is not a book for the theory lover. This is a book for the one who loves the power of simplicity and results.The message is this: if you are smart it doesn't necessarily mean that you are a good thinker."
3,No so new anymore,"The book is filled with practical exercises to expand your way of thinking on everyday issues. Its fine as far as it goes but it's basically the same as all the other creative thinking material that's being flogged everywhere these days. Furthermore, throughout the book, the author often refers to his own consulting services and other books on the same subject. Buy the book if these concepts are new to you or if you are looking for specific exercises on lateral thinking."
3,I love Blue!,"Cute book, but rather small. I was surprised at the size. Kids books seem to be so expensive for so small books."
4,Review,This book is great if have the smarts to relate it specific to your needs. Great read so far and have already used some of the suggestions.
5,EXCELLENT - One book you don't want your competition to read,"If you sell ANY product or ANY service and your competition reads this book before you do, watch out! You absolutely MUST get and read this book. It's LOADED with solid, meaty real world techniques that can really help you. You will probably find this book a real eye opener. It will help you make wise pricing decisions and show you unexpected ways to save your business from what could otherwise be failure. Don't let the price tag keep you from getting this book. It's worth many times its modest price. Get it, read it, and profit from it."
1,Not movie soundtrack,This album has nothing to do with the soundtrack from the movie Boiler Room - please stay away if that is what you're looking for.
5,INSANE,"This CD has made me crazy, not literally. This band has very simple lyrics, but they mean so much if you actually take the time to listen to them. I have seen this band 4 times live in concert and they are awesome, so please give them the support that they deserve."
3,"A ""So-So"" Debut from this New York Band","This album was originally due on Roadrunner (which i have), and since the band was dropped, the band signed to a new label.The cd starts off quite well with the energetic track ""Do it Again"" but after the 5th track, starts to go up and down, with no constant energy. It seems as if the first 5 tracks are good, but the remaining tracks seem to lack effort. The vocals are great, i love the variety in style. Guitars use a variety of styles and riffs to create diversity, which is done quite uniquely. Drumming is ok, and at times the bass is non-existant. It is a good cd, but i recommend you to listen to it before buying. Great for fans of the new hard rock bands such as Liquid Gang, and Full Devil Jacket."
3,Great while it lasted.,"This pengion squirter toy was great for a few days. My son could squirt water most of the way across a 25 m pool. However, after much use, the super squirter toy broke on day 3. The part on the bottom that sucks the water in became dislodged and would no longer get water in. He liked it so much, I will try another one if I can get it on sale."
2,Not what I was looking for,"Firstly, these gloves are NOT comfortable. The finger lengths seem weird and inconsistent, the seam between my index and middle finger dig into the area between my fingers and that is unusually distracting. Second, these are much too thick to be able to manipulate most things well, including weapons, pens, and seat belts, etc.The leather seems good, and they seem well made for the most part, but they're too big and bulky for my liking. I'm going to try thinner gloves, especially for when the weather gets hot, and for better manipulation of items."
5,wicked rad,I must say These gloves are wicked rad. The customer service was excellent due to me ordering the wrong size. they fixed the problem mid-transaction without a sweat. i'm very very pleased. dare i say it? ok i'll say it. they fit like a glove! nice. best gloves i own. and that says a lot!
4,Something different.,"Much in the same line as Simcity, Railroad Tycoon2 offers something different: a little more activity while playing. Usually on Simcity, you build and just sit there waiting for your city to grow. On RT2, you not only have to build track and train stations, but you must set which town and in what order your train will visit these stations. you also must advance to faster and more efficient trains while trying to meet the requiremnets for the task that was set for you to complete. Most of these challenges are hard, but others are even harder, especially when you have a dead line. With beautiful graphics and a little train history lesson, this game is a lot of fun to play."
5,Excellent trading Rules - applicable for today's market,I read this book from the library and knew I had to have it to read and review over and over again. The book arrived right away. Highly Recommend this book!
5,Best there is!,"Why the low ratings? I have used this for back-ups for years and it's just flat out the best there is for back-up. Do these ""other users"" really back-up? It's really simple and does it all."
1,Retrospect wants you to buy expensive support and for what?,"I use to swear by retrospect and it never let me down until OS X. Since Dantz started to support OS X its been ""You can purchase Retrospect Support, for $xxx a year...."" and how good is this support? Not very I have a very common DVDR Drive that they still don't support, I wouldn't complain if I owned the express back up, but I own the Pro package and the support is lousy! so many $$$ a call to find out that I need to update to their new software after I had just purchased an upgrade and then they still can't say they know if they support a Pioneer A107 DVDR!? $150 plus a year for support I don't think so.."
2,Unpleasant to use,"Nobody would give the authors of this software an ease-of-use award. From the outset it behaves as if it were written to please IT specialists and others whose careers depend on things being complicated and incomprehensible to mortals. Even when Retrospect is being directed to do something simple, it is not simple to do because it speaks some alien jargon. It could really serve as a model for bad interface design.It isn't much discussed, but the Mac is really lacking quality tools for backup, file synchronization, and similar critical tasks."
1,Giant Disappointment,"'Bought it, and sent it back for a refund. I should have believed all of the negative reviews that Retrospect received (on the Amazon site). I am a skilled personal computer user who has installed and successfully operated a large amount of both software and hardware. However, I was unsuccessful at getting Retrospect to perform properly. My rating of Retrospect is ""Junk"". Worse yet, I could not find a Help Line telephone number to talk with a real person - that might have made a big difference. They want you to use their website for ALL problem solving. Well think of this: if their instructions included in their big manual didn't work in the first place, why would you expect the website to work? They ought to be paying me for time lost and shipping charges."

5,Hobbit Rock,"The View thrill with this their first album, a breakthrough record in the emerging genre of Hobbit Rock. Oddly proportioned small men often communicating in an unintelligible babble, influences are broad and range from the Libertines, Kings of Leon and 1980's underground Scottish performance artists, the Krankies. If you like your rock to be made by small people with big hairy feet, and to sound satisfyingly similar to lots of other bands - Hats off to the Buskers is an essential purchase."
3,Hobbit Rock 2,"This is the album that the whole of the Shire has been waiting for: Hobbit Rock in its truest form. From the squeaky hobbit perfection of 'Same Jeans' through to the tub-thumping beats of ""Sam Gangee and Me"", this album is a corker. I've got a copy translated from the original Hobbitish and signed by Mayor of Dundee, Gilbert D'Frodo. Watch this space for a halfling tsunami of Hobbit Rock, and those 4 feisty fellows from the View will be surfing at the front."
1,...GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH DIE!!!! (yeah I'm running out of titles)...,"...this record was big in the UK...and I've had the displeasure of hearing it...and I don't understand the positive reviews this is nothing new at all...and the singer's voice? Ugh......it's annoying songs like ""The Same Jeans"" which will have people saying for weeks in a gerbil like fashion ""I've had the same jeans on for four days now"" WELL DONE!!! WE DON'T CARE.......so yes more brit pop that completely follows the verse chorus struture...no interesting instrumentals and an annoying singer...bravo england...we've done it again..."
5,"Well-made, attractive cap and patch",This was a gift for my father for Christmas. I was very happy with the baseball cap - American made and a lot sturdier than most. They did a nice job with the SAC patch as well. My dad was thrilled with it.
5,LOVED IT!!,"BRAVO! to Muffy Mead-Ferro's confidence,wit, common sense andsense of humor toward child rearing. I admire her perspective in life. Where was this little book when my children were younger?Muffy doesn't pretend to be a perfect parent and I respect that.While reading this book I wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. I have given Confessions of a Slacker Mom numerous times as gifts and will continue to do so."
2,Mediocre at best,"I really thought I was going to enjoy this book. The author seemed like she was having difficulty filling the pages of this short book and it often seemed redundant. The themes ""less is more"" and ""let your kids figure it out for themselves"" are valid and virtuous, I just wish the book was written better."
2,eh,"talk about condescending! Don't dare to do anything other than what she does in this book!! I bought this thinking it would be funny and lighthearted, but she pretty much toots her own horn the whole time."
3,One mother's memoir,"I was expecting something different too but I don't think the book ever proclaimed to be a how to book. The title does say confessions. There is a lot of family history in this book. I enjoyed the stories especially since I received this as a mother's day gift for my first mother's day. I learned that I don't have to drag a ton of toys around with us when we travel with the baby and I think the most important think I learned from this book was how to ""make do"" as a mother. If you like storytelling you'll enjoy this book. Maybe it could be inspiration for other writers to put down their stories of what they learned from their mothers and family history."
3,Hmmm,"I wonder what Muffy would have done with a child who does NOT learn from mistakes, but taught himself to read at the age of three. She rightly encourages moms to use their own brains in child rearing, but she should not denigrate other people's choices if she does not understand them. She writes with a sense of humor that would be funnier if she were wiser."
1,boring,"I kept reading to see if it got any better. Don't waste your time. After reading The Mother Trip, it was a big disappointment."
3,A light hearted take on the stresses of parenthood,"This book provides a light-hearted look at a handful of ""over-the-top"" things some parents do, for what they believe is the good of their children. It is nothing new, it has been happening for generations, but with such a large middle class, in our current society, it has become more pronounced and visible.I enjoyed the book, though at times I found it repetitive. I have had personal experience with a number of the topics she discusses and both agreed and disagreed at times with her various perspectives. In general, though, I do agree with her concept of simplification and parental instinct; instinct really meaning, do what feels right and makes you, as a parent, happy, because happy parents result in happy children. (On an aside, pretty obvious why the reviewer who does not ""even have children"" and referred to Jesus, and the manger, did not like the book.)"
3,"Good, but marred by her defensive back-to-work approach","I loved her matter-of-fact approach to kid-rearing, and most of the book reflects this attitude... like, for instance, a new baby doesn't care what you put it in to sleep. This approach has stood me in good stead through an often-overwhelming deluge of baby-store paraphernalia.However, I was annoyed later on in the book by her defensive approach to the idea of moms (specifically herself) working outside of the home, and found this inconsistent with her general feelings of caring for her kids. She explains that children are enriched through exposure to a variety of caregivers... enriched, perhaps (if we are lucky enough to afford halfway-decent English-speaking, knowledgeable caregivers -- most of us aren't!), but perhaps traumatized also by the absence of the one person they thought had committed to care for them forever.Anyway, a good book, funny, touching and true in many ways, but the last section was definitely a turn-off for this reason."
3,meh,"I read about 80% of this book and found it to be pretty amusing, but it got old quickly. Sure it was funny, mean in some ways, but funny. But just like the books and articles, websites, and parenting advice columns she tries to put down, she is just another extremist shouting in the wind. I think that this book is a must for anyone that has more than one parenting book in their library, or is spending more time trying to get their 12 hour old infant into Harvard than focusing on spending time with them and enjoying it."
1,Her secret for being a slacker mom: a nanny,"This woman didn't waste that much time hearing or seeing her kids at home, nor even her money. She had a NANNY. The nanny is her real secret, the one who will allows this mother to be a slacker one. Imaging being her kids's nanny, the parents don't waste any cent buying toys, no disposable diapers, save all the money and just pays the nanny to entertain the poor fellas, wash the cloth diapers, hears their crys,etc. This woman is the exact copy of Mrs. X (the nanny diaries), dispensing parenting tips. She never mentioned that her ranch mother had no nanny at all but she needs one. With the kids taken care of (by a surrogate mother), she can be free to earn her money giving ideas to parents on something that she is not doing."
2,Disappointing,"I came to this book as a single mom looking to find some humor and relief in a book that would combine a bit of reality with the goals of good parenting. Instead, I found it to be rather condescending and dismissive of other parenting styles. There are certainly flashes of wit, but in truth the ideas could have easily been contained in a few paragraphs. I felt that my time was not well spent in reading this book. I knew about half way through that I didn't like it, but I kept going in a hope of finding the ""good stuff"". My hopes were not rewarded. The author has a nanny. That's not ""slack"", it's wealth. I couldn't even pass it on to my friends because I really didn't like it."
1,Right message - lousy execution - very negative - not funny,"I agree with the basic premise of the book and I actually am pretty much a ""slacker mom"" as described in the book; don't over indulge kids, let them learn from their mistakes, etc. But...the author feels the need to paint caricatures of moms that do things a bit differntly and to put them down in order to justify her own high and mighty opinions. She accuses moms who do scrapbooking of creating ""shrines"" to their children. Makes her living in advertising but complains about the pressure to buy, buy buy. She writes as if parents who stay home, enroll their kids in a few classes, go to some of their kids games, etc are all idiots. One reviewer said this book has a hidden conservative agenda, a friend thought it was written by an extreme liberal -- call it what you want, it's just extremely bad. This book is not even funny. The worst book I've read in memory."
1,Conservative agenda masked as humour,"I looked forward to reading this book, expecting a humorous take on parents who overindulge their children - the kind of humour of ""The Nanny Diaries"" or the Shopaholic books. Instead, I found a conservative agenda masking as humour. Yes, there were some funny parts and Mead-Ferro makes some excellent points about not buying all the latest gadgets for children, that parents can parent with less paraphernalia and should let children figure things out for themselves (learn from their own mistakes). But a lot of it comes across as whiny justification for Mead-Ferro's ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"", no-nonsense attitude. And when she says it's okay to hit your children once in a while if you're really mad and want to get something through to them, well ... if anyone wrote a book saying it was okay to whack your wife once in a while to get her to listen, there'd be an uproar.Don't bother with this book. Spend the time hugging your children instead."
3,"Great thoughts, but heavy on the self aggrandizement","I appreciate her confessions around her so-called slacker parenting style. I also agree that our parents and grandparents must not have done everything wrong or we wouldn't be here and be semi-successful. Our society does create a lot of pressures for moms to give everything to their child, and Muffy rightly calls us onto the carpet for giving into our children too often. I wholeheartedly support her philosophy on limiting your child's toys, for example.However, she is speaking from a position of privilege - she herself notes that each of her children has their own bedroom even after she has written a chapter telling us it's ok (even preferable?) to bunk our kids together. Additionally, she could have eliminated a few pats on the back of her grandmother and mother (and herself for that matter), and the book would have been much easier to finish."
1,Poor Execution of a great idea,"I bought this book because I thought the premise was fantastic. At what point in our lives did we decide that everything must revolve around our children? However, this book does a very poor job of fully developing and talking about this idea. Additionally, she never comes out and says what the age of her children are which leads to me to believe (at the time of publication) the author was not even in a position of authority to really understand about being a slacker (i.e. she had not gotten into her kids wanting to play soccer, baseball, do ballet, art, cheerleading, etc. etc.). However much I paid for this book was too much!"
2,Disappointed,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. I hoped for a witty novela crammed with wry observations about being a ""slacker"" mom. Instead, I got a Baby Boomer doling out common sense advice.I think the term slacker was used inappropriately here. During the last decade plus, most use of the term usually refers to Generation Xrs. She uses the literal term in this book and her even more dismal book- Slacker Wife. If you want something good- check out Ariel Gore."
4,Refreshing 2!,"I just read this book and it was a breath of fresh air. It doesn't bother me that she has a nanny, lucky for her is what I say. I love the basic premise of the book and realize that it has a lot of good points in it! Our kids are wonderful and I love mine dearly but they don't need EVERYTHING and do need boundaries. The current age thinking is not on track IMO and I think a little throw back to the ""good ole days"" would do us some good. I am not advocating child labor or anything like that but just wishing a little more common sense would come back into style besides hoping that someone else would tell you how to raise your kids right!"
1,Trite and Sanctimonius,"Mead-Ferro obviously felt a need to justify her decision to continue to pursue her career after having children. A fine decision. It is unfortunate however that she had to do at expense of all other parents. She belittles, mocks and denigrates all other parenting models other that one she grew up in (which was harsh even by relative times) and the one she and her family are living now. The humor grows flat half way through chapter two and never regains an upbeat tenor. My time is precious, I do things with my kids, and it was a waste of an afternoon"
5,Great Shoes,These are the most comfortable shoes and they look great too! I have them in every color.
1,Don't buy.,"WARNING WARNING DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! Buying this is an outragous waste of money. Just buy one that saves more on in so that you don't have to buy it over and over and over. This saves maybe one small game but, no more."
3,Get what you pay for,"The color cartridge is complete crap. I already returned the first non-working color one, so I didn't feel like jumping through all those hoops again, but the color cartridge they sent out works mediocre at best.The black cart works great on the other hand, so if you're like me and mostly use your printer for B&W;, you should be fine.If you're into printing photos, don't even consider these."
1,They do not work...,"Don't waste your time and money. Black cartridige worked for less than a day. Color cartridge would not fit in printer slot. They sent another color cartridge. Same thing, would not fit. Looked in phone book under Ink Cartridge Toners and purchased a black cartridge for $18. More expensive than these, but it works as it should."
1,Spotty,"This ink was purchased for my mother, she installed it correctly and everything she prints out has blue lines across her papers."
5,Loved the price!,These work fantastic and the price was great. Couldn't get them to work at first because of an error message then found out that the steel guide rod was horrible. 8 cotton balls with alcohol didn't get it 100% clean. Make sure to do this!!!
1,Ink cartridges for Lexmark printer,"Cartridges would not function! I have spoken with knowledgeable persons about this and discovered that non-Lexmark cartridges usually will not function in Lexmark printers. Thus, I purchased bonafide Lexmark cartridges and they worked properly."
1,The ink was horrible,The black ran out after just a few dozen pages and the color jammed and had to be removed from the printer just to make it work. Don't buy this under any circumstance.
5,Love this stuff!,My second order...love it. After I learned to dampen my skin it goes on like butter. Love the way my skin feels even two days later! I recommend it!
3,A Smorgasbord of WW2 stories,"I agree with another reviewer that this book is somewhat of an anachronism; I too, perceived a similarity between these stories and pulp war stories from the late forties through the sixties.It is a veritable grab bag of stories that vary from quite good ""The Sea Witch"" to the yawner ""Hanger Rat"". To me, the two best stories by far deal with combat missions in a PBY flying boat in the south pacific in early WW2, they are fast paced, have good character development, show the authors spent some time with historical detail,and ,finally,seem plausible. It goes down hill from there to me, but everybody has their favorites on the smogasbord! In short, if you are old enough to remember war pulp stories and enjoyed them, then you will probably enjoy this compendium; if not, you may find many of the stories too tedious or far fetched to maintain your interest. I give it 3 stars solely on the strength of the 2 PBY stories."
3,Uneven,"This is a wildly uneven anthology of stories about WWII. The best of the stories are Stephen Coonts'""Sea Witch"" and James Cobb's ""Eyes of the Cat"" oddly, both are about PBY planes, a definitely unique topic. Both deliver excitement and unpredictability and a unique perspective. Stories by Barrett Tillman and Harold Coyle are standard, well told combat tales. Stories by Harold Robbins and David Hagberg belong in a different espionage anthology and there is a truly boring and glaringly out of place story by Dean Ing, who is a much better writer than this. Ralph Peters does well with his tale of a German soldier's problems returning home.Not up to the caliber of Combat, the earlier modern war anthology, this still offers enough diversion for those interested in WWII fiction if you're willing to accept the uneven nature of the stories."
3,"Cute, but . . .","Landmine isn't a bad figure, but his front scoop has a limited range of motion in vehicle mode, and his special feature of his rear tires converting to buzzsaws doesn't make much sense. Other than that, his transformation process is actually pretty involved for a figure of his size, and his poseability in robot mode is great like most of the rest of the Cybertron series. Also comes with a big gun/missile launcher, which will probably make him very appealing to young boys."
1,This is Blatant Deception,"I purchased this DVD and failed to pay close attention to the previous reviewer (DrNoRush). The DVD jacket claims that this Movie stars Bella Cortez (the Cuban beauty of Sword and Sandal fame), and Ken Clark. This is deceptive advertising - she is not in this movie, and neither is he! Don't be fooled."
5,cowgirl music,"This has my very old favorites-""Someday Soon"" and ""Restless Wind"" and no one sings them like a real cowgirl-Lynn Anderson. Every song is great!"
1,Don't buy this product,"Don't buy this product - it just doesn't work. I hoped that the other reviewers who had problems were using underpowered computers, but I couldn't get it to work on my 3 year old Dell, with 2.4GHz P4, and 1MB RAM, which are far beyond the requirements Pinnacle specifies. The captured video was so jerky, it was unwatchable. I emailed Pinnacle's tech support and got an automatic response that said I would hear from them in 24 hours. I think they meant 24 years, because 4 days later I haven't heard a work. I don't know what works better - maybe a firewire capture would work."
1,Hated this product and tech support wasn't much help,I wasted more time trying to get this to work then it was worth. Tech support was marginal at best. If you have the perfect config and are lucky enough to get it to work than you are one of the lucky ones. I would look elsewhere.
3,"Software Was Good, Hardware Not So Good","The software was pretty good and had a nice feel to it. However, the Movie Box was a pain. Power cable didn't fit the device."
1,Dissapointed,"I was so looking forward to using this software to capture & edit my video tapes, and put them on DVD. The moviebox & software did okay capturing the video. The editing & adding of chapters also went fairly smooth. But no matter how hard I tried I could not get the software to render my finished project to DVD. I checked pinnacle's online tech support & forums. The only usefull info I could get was I was not the only one having this problem. I decided to return it to the store I purchased it from & take a $43.00 bite (15% repackaging fee & shipping back to store). I'm really not too disgruntled, it was a decent product otherwise. I just thought I'd pass this info along. I'm now looking into Adobe Premiere Elements & some type of capture device or card. We'll see. Good luck to you. I know I'll need it."
1,The size is deceiving,"I ordered this bag based on the title ""Large Camera Case"". It is actually a mini case. The description and the picture of this item are deceiving. It can only fit small, compact mini digital cameras. I regret order this item."
1,"And your definition of ""large"" would be???",It is too bad they do not give the dimensions of this camera bag in the product description. This thing was tiny! It barely fit my Canon Powershot A620 camera and had no room for accessories except for maybe a micro SD card.
4,Excellent reference,"Great use of case study, factual detail and explaination is good. My enclosed software was fine, other students complained that it was ""buggy"""
3,Too wordy,"As an MBA student who had to take a strategic management class, I found this book too wordy and boring. The authors of this book tried to explain some simple concepts redundantly. In the next edition, the authors need to imorove their writing styles"
3,Kind of a let-down after his previous books,This book outlines a return to previously traveled places. It has no spark. No exitement in this one. Too bad for a last book.
1,Switched Drives-Will Not Respond To E-mails,Amazon listed drive as a LiteOn 160P6S and they shipped a LiteOn 18A1 drive-I requested the correct drive several times - but they just said that they shipped a newer unit-I explained that I wanted the specific 160P6S - that I was never consulted as to whether or not I would accept a replacement = no response.
5,Highly Recommend - Can't beat Julie Morgenstern,"Julie Morgenstern's books are always right on the money and offer great ideas. I kept getting books about organizing and decluttering, but finally realized that I knew HOW to do it, I just wasn't DOING it! This book helped me to view time in a different way and actually get things done."
4,Good Collection of Ideas,"This was a good book. It had a lot of interesting ideas - think of turning your time into a container, for example. However, I wished that the author would have stuck to a clear system. She makes it clear that no system works for everybody - you have to personalize it. That makes the reader feel like they are back at square one in some sense."
4,My Clients Love this Book,"I just got this book because my business coaching clients often have issues with running a business, often by themselves, and finding enought time to have a life. Julie offers great, easy to implement strategies that help the really busy person get control. I love that she looks at the hidden reasons behind our time management difficulties and styles. I keep recommending it and will continue!"
5,Worth Reading,"I have several of this author's books.... it is all related... organizing, keeping minimal stuff, time management, etc. I have been working on being organized and time management improvement for the last 9 months and feel that I have about 3 months to go! The benefits are there! Get this book, it is worth the order and read. Also recommend her other books as well as Regina Leeds books."
5,"This book is just amazing, excellent and so practical!!!!!!","I recommended this book highly to everybody that need take control of their lifes and be succeful.A lot of people are talking about this book and the reason is because is so useful, practical, ease to read & understand.Well done Ms. Julie Morgenstern."
5,An incredibly simple approach to time management,"I read this book from cover to cover in a matter of days. I find it an incredible and tremendously practical approach to time management. Implementation is simple and straight forward. I feel I am on the road to recovering ""me"" from this hectic world."
3,Better on paper...,"The contents and system is great however, using this type of book on Kindle is frustrating. I am going to purchase a paper book so that I can easily flip chapter to chapter and make notes in the margins."
5,I found this book truly helpful,"It's been a while since I read it, but I remember that there were a number of things that I found really helpful. The one that sticks with me is that sometimes, we budget time poorly because we don't really know how long something takes. If you think it takes you two minutes to get out the door and 10 minutes to get to work, but it really takes you seven minutes to get out and 15 minutes to commute, you're going to be 10 minutes late every day. That may seem painfully obvious, but until you've tested it, you really don't know.Also, I'd like to note that I am a right-brained, creative, mildly ADD person, and I found this book's approach flexible enough to work for me."
1,The Confessions of Nat Turner,"Good read. Can understand why some readers consider this contraversial. Trust we never go back to ""slave owners"" or their likes."
3,Way Too Long,"I read this novel when it came out and was aware of the criticisms of it at the time. I would have preferred to read a novel about Nat Turner's rebellion written by an African-American man or woman because I think such a writer could more deeply understand and depict the pain, rage, hatred, and justified rebellion that a Black slave would feel. However, I had and have no objection to reading such a novel written by a Caucasian man or woman. It's the truth of the story that matters. But on this level -- the story -- I feel that Styron didn't write a compelling book. The book is 480 pages long and felt like 680 pages long. It goes on and on, repeating things over and over. It seems unfocused. And the Nat Turner who emerges isn't knowable in any way that I could discern. Styron was a great writer: this book was not his best."
3,Interesting yet disturbing,"Then again, the whole subject of slavery is disturbing. This was a far more interesting read than I thought it would be. Styron's book is well paced and well written enough to keep you turning page after page. Wouldn't recommend it for young kids, though, for some subject matter. I'd wait until late high school or thereabouts to recommend it for reading."
5,have not read yet,"I have not read Styron's novel yet, but I plan to. It has got to be interesting. It has got to be interesting to read the point of view of someone that has experienced mental illness describing a historic figure that reveals all the signs of psychosis. If you investigate the history of Nat Turner you will note that it is limited, but that he is described as a man having scars on multiple parts of his body. So his life in slavery was not as wonderful as history would have you to believe. Yet most information I have read state that his life was ""okay"", I guess okay considering other slaves. Not to justify mass murder but considering what the life he lived and that he probably also had schizophrenia ..it is not too far to believe the story. So it has to be interesting to read Stryron's novel, only someone that has seen the isolation of mental illness would be able to interpret it."
3,Uneasy,"Is there another book or novel about Nat Turner? I can see why many blacks were disturbed about this novel. Styron took many liberties with Turner's character - especially with his ""infatuation"" for a white woman. I'm not saying that there are black men who are attracted to white women and vice versa, but does he know for a fact that Turner was actually infatuation with one?"
3,Pulitzer Prize winner TheCONFESSIONS of NAT TURNER,not in great shape but readable- the age of the paperback added to its charmIt was a gift to my son who was born the year the book won the pulitzer 1968
2,Book,"The book I ordered came quickly, and it was not expensive. However, the book was very old and musty smelling. BUT I didn't mind as it was such a good price! So far, I have had very good results in purchasing books via Amazon.com.Thanks,Jackie"
1,"The original ""Turner"" Diaries","This book is a white liberal's distortion of the personality and motivation of a black person treated like cattle and struggling to survive being worked to death. The fact that many Confederate apologists want the names of Turners ""victims"" put onto a memorial monument sails close to this joke of a book. A memorial with the names of very black man, woman child killed during slavery in the US would be closer to the truth. Under the guise of ""brutal honesty"" the author just creates another stereotype and uplifts the white man's burden in bad prose."
1,"My Great, Great Grandfather is not gay!",I don't know why this William Styron is trying to lie on my great great grandfather. Needless to say I am a decendant of Nat Turner and it bothers me that this author is trying to lie to make this book more interesting. I cannot say for certainty that my grandfather was not gay or that he didn't like white women and neither can this author but I can say that Nat Turner was married and had children and I am a decendant of that union! As far as EVERYONE knows he was NOT gay and he certainly loved his African American Wife. William Styron had no reason to portray him as such other than to make this book more appealing and that detracts from Nat Turner because it was a falsity. Other than that idiotic portrayl the book was good.
2,i don't like it,the book is written poorlylike a monotone and you get bored easilysame old word pharses throughoutdon't buy it
4,Great Watch.....Great Price,I would definitely recommend this watch to anyone. I have seen it for twice as much as I paid.
5,The REAL history book,Thia is book they are hoping you don't find. Good luck finding a copy in any library.You can really see how everything is a show put before you for you to believe. Essential reading - the REAL history book of our planet
3,An album of previously unreleased Isaac Hayes material from the Stax years.,"In early 1977, Fantasy Records purchased the Stax label's 1968-75 masters and catalog. This relatively obscure album consists of material which had been recorded by Isaac Hayes prior to his departure from Stax in late 1974 and which had originally been deemed unworthy of being released. Isaac's remakes of Roberta Flack's huge hit ""Feel Like Making Love"" and The Moonglows' ""The Ten Commandments Of Love"" are enjoyable but it's easy to see why Stax chose not to release the songs on this CD as they are definitely laclustre and (somewhat) boring in comparison to the material found on Isaac's ""Hot Buttered Soul""-era albums."
2,"Confusing reissue, OK music","Though it's poorly documented, this 1977 Stax album (STX-4102) is, roughly speaking, a reissue of Hayes' 1975 album ""Use Me"" (STX-1043). It's notable mainly for the marathon 13-minute version of Roberta Flack's 1974 hit, ""Feel Like Makin' Love"" (written by Eugene McDaniel), which was also released as a single in 1978. Track listing:1. Use Me2. I'm Gonna Have To Tell Her3. The Ten Commandments of Love4. Feel Like Makin' Love5. Hobosac and MeThe CD has four of the five tracks from the original LP, substituting the previously unreleased instrumental ""Hobosac and Me"" for ""Good Love 6-9969."" ""Use Me,"" of course, is a Bill Withers song, and ""Ten Commandments"" is the old Moonglows doo wop classic.[...]"
1,Don't Buy,"I ordered a NAS drive from CompUSA. They sent the wrong item, which was a regular hard drive ($100.00 cheaper), not the NAS drive I ordered. They refused to replace the erroneous item instead offering a refund and raised the price of the NAS drive by $70.00 rather than honor the original price. BATE AND SWITCH. Their customer service was awful I was on hold for 90 minutes trying to get a refund and still got the run-around. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM. I was surprised to find that AMAZON was equally no help telling me that my problem is with CompUSA not AMAZON who I placed the order with, and CompUSA telling me that AMAZON needs to honor the original price."
5,An essential guide for counsellors and clinicians!!,"This book was recommended during Nancy Boyd-Franklins' conference on 'working with black families' in London a few years ago. I was fortunate enough to purchase the last copy on that day. This book has been instrumental in helping me to further develop our work with clients from a diverse background. In addition, my colleagues, parents of black and multi-racial children and professionals in other organisations who come along to our workshops, cannot but help to broaden their view when presented with Mr. Carter's teachings."
4,I just finished reading the book,I recommend this book to individuals thinking about starting a business or undertaking some other life-changing event. Ms. Hoskins learned and shared a lot of important lessons about business and human motivation.
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book because I am a woman and a entrepreneur and I wanted to be encouraged, inspired. I found the book to be repetitive and I would gloss over the desparate comments aimed at ""whites"" because I am a woman - a white woman. Not my choice, just the genes. I am first and foremost a woman and wanted to be inspired as such. I continued to read, hoping it would get better. I could relate to the mother-daughter connection - I have two. But time and again, the ""white"" issue rose it's ugly head. This book is written solely for the African-American woman and that is so sad - the rest of us women entrepreneurs need leaders to."
3,a bit dry,"I wanted to love this book. It's the true story of how one woman went from welfare to million dollar success using an old family recipe for syrup. It's a truly amazing story but it's not written well. It's too dry, and is too choppy. It reads like it was put together from a taped interview or speech and it's also bit cold. The author's family members are all presented in a less than flattering light and I could have done without some of the spiritual beliefs that were expressed. There was a whole lot of story here. It just wasn't crafted well."
4,Remembering Bugsy Malone,"I first saw this movie in the actual theatre when I was 7 years old. I spent years after lip synching the songs and performing them with friends, as the music is clever and creative.Bugsy Malone has always been one of my favorites, but very difficult to find in the video stores. The concept and choreography were very well developed, considering the ages of cast members, and trying to direct children to act like 1920's gangsters, which could not have been an easy feat for Parker. While the story line is typical, the fun of watching these children take on adult identities was what made me wish I were a cast member myself when I was a child. I don't recall this being a very well-publicized movie, but I know that I will never forget William's musical input as well as the fun of watching Baio and Foster on screen."
1,not what i ordered,"i thought i wqas getting the American version, not he Hong Kong version.Why ndidn't you make it clearer?"
1,DVD won't play in regular DVD players,"My review is about the DVD itself not the movie. I loved the movie Bugsy Malone when I was a child so I was thrilled to see it again in DVD. Well to my surprise the DVD took 4 weeks to get here. Then when it was here it wouldn't play because it's in ""Blue Ray"" formmat. I don't have a blue Ray player and it doesn't mention about it's being only in Blue Ray formant on the order page. So I waited 4 weeks and can't play the DVD when I finally got it. Not to mention paying the postage to return it for a refund."
1,bugsy loada rubbish,ok this film makes me cringe and yes i am the only person to give it a bad review but its rubbish.its basicley loads of kids pretending to be gangsters and miming to cruddy songs sung by grownups in between the rubbish script.also the acting is rubbish and look out for jodie foster as tallola or however you spell it. basicley this aint no godfather its like watching a primary school class on lcd.
4,A great second feature for Chicago,"For a great night's doublebill, Chicago and Bugsy Malone can't be beat. Chicago is pure cynicism and Bugsy sheer innocence. Blousy and Tallulah are like Roxy and Velma before the fall. Why is there such joy in watching these beautiful children playing lowlife characters? Maybe because it's such a brilliant comment on the sheer childishness of so much allegedly grownup behavior. Never mind. What matters is that this movie is such fun for kids and grownups too. Inspired concept. Inspired songs. Inspired lunacy."
4,Relieved! ...it's NOT dubbed or loaded with subtitles...,"This purchase is a huge relief!I have wanted to order this dvd for awhile, but was hung up on the Asian text on the cover. I ordered it as a gift for my kids so I went ahead & watched most of it, and it is as fun as I remember it from my childhood. There are a few dubious intro sequences - for the Dolby sound and perhaps the production company - that made me nervous, but then it went straight to the movie. There was no menu screen to start.I did go to the main menu to verify that it was what I would expect, and it also has Chinese characters along with the English menu selections. Nothing special. Nothing disruptive.The only thing that kept me from giving a 5-star rating is that a hard-core acoustics person (aka: husbands) will probably find the sound to be slightly tin-y. Perhaps, if we had a better stero system the sound would be fuller."
4,Great Musical,"I remember watching this movie as a kid. It really has memorable songs, and cute aspects that make an otherwise violent subject (prohibition-era gangsters) humorous. It was cool finding a clean DVD."
4,Students love this movie!,"I first saw this movie when I was very young. My younger brother and I absolutely adored it, and we watched it quite often. Now, I am a music teacher for children between the ages of 12 and 18 -- I started out showing the movie each year for a holiday treat, but because the students were so positively responsive to it, I am now using it as a teaching tool in my general music classes. The humor behind the cars, dough-guns and ""adult world"" does a great job of masking the fact that this movie is, in fact, a MUSICAL! Some of my students are in my class for several years, and when it's time for me to get this movie out again, they really do get quite excited. Bugsy Malone is great entertainment."
5,"Bugsy Malone, Great Hit For All Ages!","Bugsy Malone is the best movie ever made! No Argument! This is by far the best piece of filmwork that has ever crossed the US's path! I would Gladly do a reproduction of the film anyday; however, I am 45 years old. :("
4,Bugsy Malone,"My grown sons enjoyed this movie when they were young, so I purchased this as a nostalgic treat. It brought back some memories and some good laughs. It,s a new group of people doing ""Little Rascals"" types of activities. It was enjoyable."
5,Bugsy Malone,"I had seen the movie a long time ago and really enjoyed it. I had taped it off cable, but someone recorded over it. I never thought I would find it. Now I can enjoy it again."
3,Clearly a Chinese copy but it works.,"Great musical. Took me back to when I was a kid. I enjoyed it about as much as I did some 30 years ago. I still can sing along with the music. The only downside is the the DVD hits a chapter and it gets stuck on it and it loops. I had to click chapter forward but after that it played through. The DVD does nothing but play the movie so that usually means that it's a pirated copy. So, too much money to pay for a pirated copy so clearly someone in China is cleaning up."
4,Pleased,"I was very satisfied with cd I purchased. It will be a christmas present, so have not see the movie yet. Shipment was quick and as promised."
3,Bugsy Malone DVD,I am happy with the movie but I was very disappointed that the cover and everything was in Chinese. I was afraid that the movie would also be in Chinese.
1,Amazon sent me a foreign DVD - NOT what I ordered!,"I ordered this DVD after carefully reading everything. That's not what I got! I got a foreign version of it. Useless to me. Now I'm out the cost of my shipping and will have to pay to send it back. Needless to say I am gunshy about ordering anything again. I think the catch is that there was no picture. If there had been I would have seen the foreign lettering. Bait & Switch at its finest. If Amazon can't redeem themselves somehow in the red tape of emails I have to send, then I am finished with ordering from them."
1,ALSO RIPPED OFF !!!!!!,I also carefully checked and rechecked my order before placing and then low and behold....... A GERMAN COPY shows up which will not even play. This is ridiculous and is false advertising.I contacted the seller to see what to do and how much it will cost with no reply yet. We work too hard to be ripped off and shame on everyone involved for being butt-heads.
1,WHO KNOWS??,Why isn't this title available in ENGLISH? Sent this back as it is a FOREIGN language!!!
2,Disappointing,"Sadly, this isn't the English language version of Bugsy Malone - something I didn't realize when I ordered it. I can't play it either so it was a waste of time and money for me! I'd like to send it back and get one I could actually enjoy."
1,Still on here to order??,"I ordered this in Dec 05 for Christmas present. Amazon says there was a problem with manufacture delivery. I inquirer again later and they say just to leave it and that I haven't been actually charged yet. Now I check back and either lot of these reviews are faked by Amazon or I don't know (maybe in countries other than the US). Cause my order still says: Delivery estimate: January 13, 2006I think it is really bad of Amazon to even leave this item on here when apparently don't actually have an item to sell for going on almost 2 years.Guess what? Now it is August 8, 2008 and still isn't here."
5,excellent movie and soundtrack... the perfect ingredients,"a phenomanal soundtrack beautifully frames this wonderful movie with a cast that is perfect. this film will stay in your heart forever, as it has mine"
5,My mother loves it,"My mother wanted this dvd for ages. We were excited to find it on Amazon, but couldn't find a US release. This movie, however, does have English audio."
4,Follow The Monsters,"""Follow the Monsters"" is a typically lighthearted Sesame Street book ideal for kids in the 12-36 months range who are just learning to enjoy books, and maybe can even read a bit on their own. The characters are a large cast of furry monsters in search of a way to Sesame Steet. The book focuses on describing the monsters (fat and thin, red and blue, old and young) and how they travel to Sesame Street (walking, flying). No deep messages here, but our 16 month old loves it and, perhaps as important, it is a book we enjoy reading to him."
3,book order,"paid for faster shipping which in same state just miles apart we should have gotten it quickly. It still took almost a week. So book was late. Not in the best of shape, but what we ordered."
4,There raps are much more approved,"unfortunately the beats are not as good yes the quality is excellent but the beats are just good.Its there raps that are better on here then the Production they are much better lyrics then there 1st album and are quite good.I was listening to ""The Hours"" and damn he they killed that track good raps on thisLyrics 9/10 Production 8/10 X Factor 8/10 Classic 6/10 Me 8/10Overall=39/50 This album will recieve a 4 Mic rating solidAlso recommended-Common,Roots,Little Brother see yeah Chris Rating review"
5,i want 2 move 2 detroit.......,"just put it in and get back,an just listen the beats iz a new era in hip hop,jay dee iz untouchable,an has a very good sense of music.his production iz out standing..check this cd out. ,that one cutt that sounds like zapp...iz the bomb check em out the rapps iz very crucial. I dig slum village.the whole cd iz bumpin."
2,"A few head nodders, with a hidden Classic","With all the big name artists dropping albums lately, it's easy to look past certain albums by certain artists that aren't really in the ""mainstream"" of things. Slum Village realized this and collaborated with a man who seems to be on everything right now, Kayne West. With their first single ""Selfish"", they seem to have found the perfect formula for success. I swear I can sing the hook of that song for hours. Now hearing their first single I expected to be treated to some of the same...however, I came to like only a few other songs. If you have a Cd Burner and a good downloading program, just get the selfish song and save your money."
4,SLUM VILLAGE DELIVER A SOLID ALBUM,"VERY ENJOYABLE. ONE OF THE BETTER OF THE YEAR. DETROIT DELI IS GETTIN MAD ROTATION IN THE CD PLAYER, AT LEAST UNTIL THE NEW ROOTS ALBUM DROPS. ELZHI IS THE BEST NEW CAT IN THE GAME. BELIEVE THAT.THETZA OUT."
2,about a 2-to a 2.5,"Slum Village always has a track or two that I can get with&then I'm stuck with so-so to forgetable cuts there after.this Album has good Production but the writing ain't happening&that is my biggest knock here.""Selfish"" is one of those Cuts when they drop a Greatest Hits set that I will Rock this time of the year for it's laid back feel&vibe.much like with ""Tainted"".""The Hours"" is a cool rack.but to me they have a singles Act written all over them&nothing wrong with that at all."
4,Well received gift.,These floor mats were very heavy and it would seem they will last a long time. The deep channels are good for melting snow on the floor and the person I gave them to for Christmas was very happy with them.
3,not what I thought,"The back floor mats have no grip,they slid all around when someone sits in the back of my car,NOT GOOD!"
5,its good,its cool no problems with delivery little smaller then my old car mats but will work well in a 2006 or newer sadan
3,Be careful not what you were expecting!!!,"When I bought these floor mats I was taking out the OEM mats. These mats did not cover the whole floor on the driver side nor anywhere else including the back, However I am such a TAZ I over looked that I also don't like the fact they shift all over the place you have to adjust them daily. But the mats are cool looking.! Be careful when ordering these mats especially on full size trucks."
3,One time fun,I was dissapointed that this was a one time put stickers on a background toy. It only took my daughter a few minutes and it was done. I like the button art toy much better because they can do it over and over.
3,DVD's as promised,"Once again a very cheap price for a fun series. I wish that it had the original music in the opening sequence. Miss the ""Love and Marriage"" song. But a great value for this series."
4,"Married with Children, Funny Funny Funny! Packaging Sucks.","I received The complete series of Married with Children on Sept 27th. This is a great show, extremely funny. The only problem is that the packaging sucks. Sixteen Disks on two spirals. Only one sheet of paper with every episode in very small print that you peel off of the back of the box, but I got the entrie series for $35.00 on a pre-order sale, so even though I don't like the packaging it was well worth this bargain of a price. So many episodes I'll never get around to watching them all. I highly recommend this purchase. I did give it four stars instead of five because of the packageing, but considering your getting it for less than $5.00 a season, its a great deal."
5,Finally came out,"I am so happy that Married With Children series finally came out on dvd, been waiting so long. I watched almost every episode growing up and will continue to watch the heck out of these dvds. I don't care that they don't have any extras I just love the episodes. Thanks"
2,Bad information to costumers.,"According to Amazon's description, the option ""SUBTITLED"" is available, which is not true. There's no subtitles, any language. Considering that MWC is a very funny and classic sitcom, very successful in all over the world, the quality is poor. And that's why I think it could have subtitles for many languages."
5,Great Movie .... .... ...... ..... ...... ....... ..... ...... ....... ...... ...... ....... ...... ..... ...... ... ....... ...,Great Movie .... .... ...... ..... ...... ....... ..... ...... ....... ...... ...... ....... ...... ..... ...... ... ....... ...
4,a lot of bang for your buck,"It's a great show and a long episode list.lots of entertainment value for a low price.it's been repackaged to be cheaper but also more inconvenient.in my opinion, it's well worth the low price tag for all 5962 minutes of this ballsy sitcom.maybe i just love it because i relate to al yet love seeing him miserable.i will recommend to others."
2,review is for packaging only!!!!!!!!,"no list of episodes and discs are stacked on top of each other, its a bitch to search for specific episodes without a listing"
2,packing,This set of dvd's could have been package much better.I had to take a paint marker and re-number them.
4,A Great Gift for the Married with Children Fan!,"Married with Children: The Complete Series on DVD is an affordable but wonderful gift for the television fan of this long running sitcom. Previously, I bought all 11 seasons, one at a time, for a lot more money.I wished all television series on DVD would just come out in a nice package like this one. It comes with all the DVDs and no other information to help guide the viewer though. That's one criticism where I felt that if I didn't have it on my other collection, I would be lost looking for a specific episode.If you do plan to purchase this DVD series, you will get it an affordable price but the packaging needs to include information regarding episodes and specials. Still it's a fabulous gift for the Married with Children fan."
3,You can definitely tell why it seems like such a good deal.,"For the price it's an incredible deal. All 11 seasons for $35 is pretty hard to beat. It kinda bugs me that they cheaped out on the title music and the packaging. The original Frank Sinatra song they used on the opening/closing credits got replaced with a crummy knock-off that sounds more like polka. The packaging is pretty bad too. It opens up with 2 spindles on each side with the discs all stacked on each other with a piece of cardboard holding them in place. It came unglued and pretty much fell apart the day i bought it. But overall it's still a good deal, and I'll just take a hot glue gun to the package, then get my Bundy on."
5,GREAT,A GREAT show to make you smile....good that the entire series is available on one set that has an affordable purchase price. Well worthwhile if the Bundy family can take anyone away from the daily lousy national news we are subject too. I never get tired of watching these shows over and over....Al Bundy thinking never ages over time.
5,Great music,Exactly what I was looking for and the sound is great. Great and quick service and excellent price. Better bargains and more variety than local stores. I will shop for more CD's on Amazon.
5,The Real Quiet Storm,"Imagine you, your romantic partner a chilled bottle of Chablis on a lazy Sunday afternoon. A beautiful rain storm and - Oh Yeah .....it's that good. Nuf said."
5,You have no idea what you're missing!,"I bought this album because I had heard it was good and I'm fond of Funk. However, when I had the chance to sit, chill, and listen to this album in its desired environment, the only thing I could say after the eighteen minutes of ""by the time I get to phoenix"" was WOW! This album greatly exceeded my expectations, in fact it shattered them to pieces. From the classic guitar riffs in ""Walk on By"" to the deep groves of the seemingly meticulously planned string and horn sections of all four songs, Hayes encompasses his talent into something yet to be paralled. Everyone should hear this album at least once, and few should have a reason to dislike it. It encompasses genres from funk, to classic rock, to soul, to classical, and always leaving you wanting more."
3,Overrated...Don't Waste Your $,"1. Walk On By - Everything comes together on the first track - why do you think they put it there...?2. Hyper... - Suffers from terrible female chorus; bogs down to a jam session, and is saved later by Hayes' piano work.3. One Woman - Totally forgettable...it's a song you can't wait to end. Only listenable once; you will skip it from then on.4. Phoenix - Painfully long intro about some imagined fella Hayes thought would fit at the start. Skip this to the song itself, and you get someone who is trying very hard to be sincere, but isn't. Although he does seem at times to be inspired by the lyrics.Judged by today's standards, this would be a 10, but up against the context of the great albums of 1969, this is a 3. If you want a truely sincere, soulful, heartfelt album by a black artist that came out in the same year, get George Benson's ""The Other Side Of Abbey Road""."
4,a great album but is it worth getting the sacd version?,"The album is great...doesn't matter if it is only cd or sacd. The thing with this disc, or at least the advertising is that it is not a 5.1 sacd, only stereo. If you have a 5.1 sound system, you will only get playback through the front two speakers."
1,Not as expected. Poor quality recording,The music was uneven and the volumn was going in and out as I listened to it. Really disappointing. Poor quality recording.
5,An all-time classic album,"Few albums climb to the top of their genre so as to define the genre. Isaac Hayes' album is the very definition of Hot Buttered Soul. The vocals, in combination with the orchestrations on virtually every track on the album, provide a powerful mood-setting experience. I purchased the original album in 1970 based on the recommendation of (the late great) Marty Faye---a Chicago Jazz DJ; But this re-release on CD is sublime."
5,Not long enough,"Being someone who rarely listens to songs over 6 minutes i decided to take a gamble and purchase this LP. That said i could not believe my ears, the 30 second samples give these tracks little justice, just as it seemed i had placed the needle on the record i found myself having to start over, though long they seem on paper, in reality the tracks are so good by the time you realize it you have to replay them again and again making the album not long enough,i must have replayed side 1 four times! though one thing i must admit the intro to ""by the time i get to pheonix"" would have been better in a LIVE recording and not a studio one, but i dont mind, having the vinyl version allows me to set the needle ahead of the intro (but i wont)"
4,Sexy and Hot Buttered Soul,"This recording brings back great memories. My uncle in Houston turned my siblings and I on to Issac Hayes album back in 1972. When I saw the 40th anniversary edition, I bought it right away. I thought it was odd that the original album only had four tracks on it. I loved the mellow and soulful sound of Hayes' music. I call it my ""sitting in the hot tub under the stars with a glass of wine"" music. His redition of ""By The Time I Get To Phoenix"" is a beautiful word picture of a man hopelessly in love with a woman not worthy of that love. If you love soul music and have a hot tub, I recommend this music."
5,Just go back from seeing his show in Branson,We just got back from seeing his show in Branson. If you ever get a chance to see his show you will not regret it. He was the only performer we saw that took the time to greet everyone in person after the show. He's a class act!
1,Second-rate Pat Boone Recording,"Not the original recordings; not even the original recordings remastered. These renditions were made by an older Pat Boone who couldn't hit the high notes, and who didn't have the depth for the low notes. This set of recordings are truly second-rate. I flushed my version off my disk. Instead of buying this (apparently low-cost) album, go for the ""20th Century Masters: The Millennium Collection: Best Of Pat Boone""; these are the originals. I know, because I was in high school when he recorded them and I could not forget his beautiful voice. His voice on THIS album does not have that beauty."
3,Good for the one song I wanted,"I am not a Pat Boone fan. I bought this album mainly for one song,""Moody River"", (though this appears to be an album of re-recordings) because the price was right. The sound quality seemed OK to me. So I got my money's worth."
1,Wrong,"Item listed IS NOT, repeat NOT the 1957 DOT label recording of the soundtrack for the movie ""April Love."""
4,So Happy to Complete my Set,"I have used this pattern for 10 years. Over time, pieces have been dropped and broken. I was very happy to find replacements (plus a couple of extras)"
1,ExStik pH100 Meter Is A Terrible Product,"The ExStik pH100 does not work. If I had the time, I'd make a video review to go along with these words. Even after calibration, using ExTech's own solutions, the pH100 fails to read pH levels anywhere near-accurate. It randomly reports its 'findings', even when using the same sample being tested. The fault may be with the included pH electrode (and sealed solution), which you have no way of knowing the condition or age of, because it's not packaged separately or appropriately for sensitive electronics. For the cost of this item, you'd expect some level of quality. Look elsewhere, because this product will disappoint both you and your wallet. But, if you still want to buy this piece of junk, I'll mail you mine for just the cost of shipping. You'll still be getting ripped off, but you won't feel so bad as purchasing at full price."
1,Two in a row defective,I've been waiting for 3 weeks for the third replacement. Customer service lacking. I have a masters in chemistry so user error not the issue. Guess I'm just the lucky one.
1,Disgusting,"This author is obviously not comfortable in his own skin (whatever colour he decides that it is). He should be ashamed of using a family the way he did for filthy lucre. It is obvious to anyone who knows Jamaica and Jamaicans well, which family is that he has not tried very hardto disguise. Obviously he has an unhealthy obsession with both the colour of one's skin and illicit sex."
2,international edition,I couldn't justify spending $170 on a paperback this small. I bought the international edition for $45 and it seems to be exactly the same except the cover art is different. I have been using it all semester without a problem.
2,The Good and the Bad,"The GOOD: I bought this brand passport holder in RED because it had a zipper pouch on the backside. I wanted to hold a few dollars there as a convenience. Well, it was all that I had hoped for. The convenient zipper compartment UNTIL I used this item.The BAD: The folder that the airline tickets come in would not fit in the case and folding the e-tickets prsented a problem, also.It is fine to keep the current airline ticket out the airline folder but when you have multiple boarding passes and ticket receipts it is inconvenient to have to fold the folder to save it in this passport case. Also the baggage tickets on on the Airline Ticket Folder.I would love this passport case if it was just a smiggin wider to hold documents because it is the only one I can find with a zipper compartment.Just beware your documents may not fit in this case! unless they have revised it."
4,Lost in Polynesia,"Not for everyone is the languid beauty of this film set on a tropical isle and filmed in scintillating black and white. The movie is like time travel back to the 1930s where you set out into a polynesia wonderland that never existed. If you enjoy stunnnibg black and white, and the mercurial Dolores Del Rio swimming nude underwater, or Joel Mcrea showing off his European ingenuity to awe-struck natives, this is the movie for you. Don't expect an honest assesment of colonialism or strongly developed characters. Pure escape and revery, instead."
3,Curious,"None of the reviews have noted, so I have to ask: does the end of the film (Bird.. that is) have McCrae shooting or blowing up the natives who murder del Rio over ignorant superstitions? Prefer happy endings and that is the second level happy ending. Thanks for info, H."
5,Bird of Paradise,This movie shows how the ancient Hawaiian culture was sacred and that it had to be followed out or misfortune can happen to you or your loved ones.
3,Bird of Paradise - Which Version,Has Amazon ever cleared up the confusion regarding the version of this movie. The jacket shows the original 1932 version but the cast is from the 1951 remake.
3,Delores Del Rio at her best,"This film is an interesting mix of pre-code dressing, early Hollywood's fascination with Pacific isles and Joel McCray. Sailor McCray is bewitched by island beauty del Rio when she swims nude around his yacht. He follows and wins her but not as he expected. This film has wonderful island scenery and the beaufiful del Rio. I would recommend Bird of Paradise for 1)pre-code fans 2)Delores del Rio fans 3)Joel McCray fans and 4)those who dream of getting away from it all on some remote Pacific island."
2,not like picture,Does NOT look like the picture in the advertisement. The print should look the same. It does not. I've bought other clings that do and should look like the picture. Not impressed.
5,Oh Yes!,"Oh Yes. This is truly a blessing. The power, the spirit, the intensity of this concert is spell binding. This is gospel music to me!"
2,False claims,I purchased a cd from this seller that was advertised as new. However the cd came in an unsealed cd case and was obviously used. The insert was old and had stains on it and was slightly ripped. When I contacted the seller she denied that the cd was used. The only reason I kept it was because the cd was in good condition and I didn't want to go through the trouble of shipping it back. I won't order from this seller again.
1,Terrible product,"This is absolutely the worst software purchase I've ever made. Never have I had such a problem with an internet security program before. The previous edition worked fine, this one endlessly freezes up my computer, I have problems using the Mozilla browser, the list goes on and on. And in order to uninstall it from your system, you have to go on the Symantec website to get the instructions to remove it. One thing is certain, I'll never try an updated version of this product again."
2,Wrong product shipped,They shipped the wrong product I asked for 2000 they sent 2005 which is not compatable with my operating system so Now I can't even use the product.
1,Norton Internet Security and Antispyware,"I had to send back to Symantec. It would not download on my computer as I have Windows ME. I was told the 2005 edition would download on my computer, but it wouldn't. They are sending me a refund.I appreciate the fast service and the good attitude on the phone, and politeness given to me. They were ready to please the customer.Rita C.Clark"
2,HAVE FUN CALLING INDIA,"""Halo? dis is Shbismeeerischkabob, kahney elp yu?""I loved Norton for years and never had to call them before. So what if they had a cash cow? My computer was fine and it was well worth the 50 bucks a year.Not anymore baby..You WILL be calling them eventually and the people on the other end are HELPLESS. You barely get through reading them the error code (because they have to repeat it) when they (somehow) manage to repeat your email address only to send you a 'stock' fix-it document that MAY work.Eff You Norton!AND GET READY TO PAY 30 BUCKS PER INCIDENT!!!!!!!!!"
1,A Most Unhelpful Upgrade - Internet Access Disabled,"Upgrading two Pentium 4 computers from Norton Internet Security 2005 to Norton Internet Security 2005 AntiSpyware Edition resulted in the loss of Internet browsing capabilities on both machines. Suggested solutions on the Symantec web site were of no assistance. These machines had run earlier versions of Norton Internet Security without any problems. E-mail access works but internet browsing, whether through IE or Firefox, is disabled. Turning off Internet Security does not restore browsing capability, the computer must be rebooted with Internet Security disabled in order to browse the Internet.Live technical support is provided only on a charge per call basis."
2,Resource Hog,"This would be a fantastic product if it did nothog all you resources. I bought it and finallyuninstalled it because it slowed down my systemway to much. If Symantec reads these reviews,which I dought, since this has been a problemfor years, please work on this problem. If theycut resource useage they would probably win backalot of coustomers."
1,NIS will let your computer lethargic,"Norton Internet Security 2005 will completely take over your system processing time bringing your computer to its knees!!. NIS will protect your PC, but it will also convert a P4 2.66 GHz with 768MB RAM in to a lethargic computer. For NIS to run it uses more than 21 processes that take almost 40MB of your valuable system RAM, it is absurd.Worst of all, try to access their inexistent support... you don't have the right for even one call. They only take calls from corporate customers/products.Go for some other product, RUN AWAY! don't use this one!. I did not followed others reviews, what a big mistake!!"
1,Do not upgrade to this package if NIS 2004 is working,"I am a long-time fan of Norton, and have used it for many, many years. Hence my extreme disappointment that when I installed this Spyware version as an upgrade to NIS 2004, it refused to do a System Scan, or to scan my incoming or outgoing email.I spent a full day with their tech reps, priority/work job # 23218850, who were completely unable to solve the problem: ""certain Norton Antivirus components were not installed. [Error] 3019,6.""Initially I was unable to unload WORD attachments until I had unplugged the plug-in for Microsoft Office XP.The Tech Rep conclusion was that I had debris from NIS 2004 which prevented the Antivirus portion of this package from becoming operational. I scanned my stand alone WIN XP from the Norton home site and have NO Security issues and NO virii.Caveat emptor to the max."
2,I could do without the throat clearing.,"This would have been great except I kept hearing someone in the foreground clearing their throat. Not the really bad phlegm sound but still it bugged me. Perhaps this explains the price, too good to be true."
3,Great American Literature,"Having read this years ago and finding it again for my Kindle is a treat. James Fenimore Cooper delivers a great story that allows the reader to understand the era, people, geography and lives they led. As one of the first classic American writers Cooper drew on his many experiences from his youth from the area around Cooperstown,New York. This lends credibility to the story that allows one to enjoy the characters and identify with their drama as the story unfolds. I enjoyed reading this as a freshman in college and it has been great rediscovering again as one of the great pieces in the American literature lexicon."
3,Love the Story But Enjoy It More in Movie Form,"There are several great movies of The Last of the Mohicans especially a silent version and the Daniel Day Lewis film that came out several years ago. I've always loved the story and knew I needed to read the book. I found it a very difficult read however. The story is great but I am bogged down by James Fenimore Cooper's writing style and ponderous wording. He obviously had a good understanding of the area in which he lived and the native peoples but I found his book hard going. So I can say I read it, appreciate the story but didn't enjoy the book. Sometimes the movies are better than the book."
4,review,"a good read with lots of vivid imagery and a great story. Strong characters with good basis of historical fact mixed in, well worth a read."
4,Moving - in both senses: Motion and Emotion,"The language takes some getting used to but becomes less and less an obstruction as the contexts and action of the narrative get going. I watched the Daniel Day-Lewis movie first, then read this. Both are worth the time and effort but if you have to choose, read the book. Much more appreciation for and development of the characters in the text than in the movie."
3,All dressed up and nowhere to go,"I won't deny that ""The Last of the Mohicans"" is a great early-American novel. I won't even deny that I enjoyed it, because I most certainly did. However, it's Cooper's style with which I take issue. Much of his language is superfluous, and renders the text more difficult to read. And, no, it's not simply the problem of an old-fashioned writing style. The text is so riddled with repetition and passive voice that it becomes tedious and boring (even during otherwise thrilling scenes).The only other major problem I have with this book is the lack of direction. Even at the very end, it fails to arrive anywhere. I consider ""The Last of the Mohicans"" a sometimes intriguing, sometimes lagging description of random people wandering around in the woods with no particular reason."
4,Excellent classic and good ebook adaptation,"This book is an American classic. It shows the conflicts between the Old World and the New, between native and colonist, between subject and ruler. In it you can see the development of a uniquely American worldview, marked by independence, strength, anti-intellectualism, and a pinch of suspicion. Really fascinating as you can see all of these qualities in so many Americans today.The e-book adaptation was great with explanatory footnotes included."
2,Last of the mohicans; a challenge for the young mind,"I'm a junior in high school and recently read lotm for an advanced english 3 class. I found it some what wordy and very drawn out. Some where buried underneath a mound of words that I struggled to understand was an interesting and historical plot. I really liked the plot and time setting, but I don't think Cooper's style of writing was intended for my generation. I would definately mention the reading of this book to an adult who appreciates american classics, but I wouldn't even admitt reading it to a younger person."
2,See the movie...don't bother reading it.,"When I was a senior I decided to use this book for my AP English class report becuase I had loved the movie...""and books are always better then the movies made after them...it must be wonderful!"" I thought. Ha ha. When I chose the book the teacher read a quote by Mark Twain criticising it ALOUD in class. I thought it was sort of rude at the time...then I started reading it and realized he had been trying to warn me. The book is AWFUL! Cooper can't keep his characterization straight. One line one character says something and the next, if it hadn't said ""so and so said"" I would have thought it was someone else talking, and these aren't supposed to be colonialists with muctiple personality disorder. I week before my paper was due I changed my book to Hamlet just so I wouldn't have to read the rest of that thing...and I love reading literature--I'm now an English major. But just becuase it's a ""classic"" doesn't make it good reading."
1,So boring. Didn't make it.,"Okay, I gave this book two tries. Not one, but two. A friend of mine in high school recommended it, so I bought it. Tried reading it, didn't get very far, and back onto the shelf it went.Fast forward about eight or so years, find me sorting through my books, and Last of the Mohicans was rediscovered. I believe I got about 200 pages into it over the course of 2 1/2 weeks, and bleh, I just can't force myself to read this any more. It is very seldom that I won't finish a book, even one I don't like, but I just can't get through this one.For the first 200 pages, the characters are shallow and uninteresting. The women are gentle and reserved and know their places, and the men are violent and love to shoot things. The plot can basically be summarized this way:-- Hack through forest.-- Make racist statements.-- Kill some people.-- Repeat.Maybe it gets better on page 201. I don't know. But this one is going in the Goodwill box."
2,Very flawed and over-rated?...,"Everyone knows the story of 'Last of the Mohicans', presumably from watching the Daniel Day-Lewis film. But what surprised me is how poor the novel by James Fenimore Cooper is. Two-dimensional characterisation (eg Duncan Heyward - gallant hero?) worsens a tale which seems to lack any proper structure apart from shoving in as many scenes of fighting and dramatic escape as possible. There are positive elements, such as the cunning but subtle personage of Magua and the basic premise of battles in the forested wilderness of North America. Perhaps that is why the recent film version is so much better - it takes all the good parts of the book, adds some new ideas and mixes them together."
2,An almost complete waste of paper,"This book not only made me groan every time I picked it up, but discouraged me from reading other books by the same author. For anybody reading this and saying that I am wrong, I disagree. The Last of the Mohicans was not a book I would recommend, especially because of all the confusing characters , sights, and places. This book was something I might read again, but definately not until I can understand it better. James Fenimore Cooper, I give you credit, but I still did not enjoy reading you're book. I guess it's just not my style."
5,"Loved the movie, but this was better.","I really enjoyed the book, although I was not pleased with the ending. The book deviated from the movie quite a bit and since it it one of my favorite movies it was a disappointing ending to the book. The character development was great and it was easy to get to know the characters."
4,the film is better than the book...,"well, as I said, if you have watched the film and then read the book, you will probably be disappointed... I am not saying this is a bad book...I enjoyed reading it, but I watched the film first, so it kinda ruined my enjoyment of the book...the book itself is classic and I would reconmand you to read it. :)"
5,One of my favorite classic novels,"Years ago I spent some time reading certain classic novels I had never read before. Last of the Mohicans was one of them. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The movieThe Last of the Mohicanswas a fantastic adaptation of this novel. Overall, a very good read."
2,Hard to understand,"This book is not quite what I expected. I expected a book I could UNDERSTAND. It may have a nice adventurous plot, but it is just way too hard to read. It was more of a burden to read than a joy. I see it as similar to a majic eye. You can't figure out what it is saying unless you cross your eyes. If you like to read books at night to make you go to sleep this one is ideal. Also, I found that I had to stop and think about what I just read because it was so hard to read and understand. I lost my excitement for reading it on the first page."
2,"Dated, does not translate well into the 21st century","I expected more from a classic of American literature. In contrast to some of the other reviewers, I thought that the Indian characters were stereotyped as either ""noble savages"" or bloodthirsty brutes. The actions of the English characters are sometimes incomprehensible and the females are of course particularly helpless. Somehow when I read other period literature I can relate a woman's actions to the society of her time, but I couldn't do that here. The Hawkeye character was interesting, but often came off as eccentric rather than heroic and I'm not sure that was the intent. Well, I can say I read it. My copy is going to the used book store."
2,"If you can possibly help it, don't read this book!","I was assigned this book for summer reading this year since I am about to enter the Gifted English program. I was very excited to read it at first, because i loved watching those old cowboy movies as a little kid. After about the first 100 pages I realized the challenge that faced me, getting through the long gaps between the good parts. I do hope some day to even finish the darn thing (it's nearly 400 pages long, I'm on page 102). I did give it two stars because the action scenes are so well written. If your thinking about reading this for fun don't bother, the movie is much better, or so I hear."
1,"NO, IM NOT A MOVIE ADDICT","Excuse me, but I have read Melville and Dickens(I adore Dickens)and I would please like to ask one reviewer(and if they're reading this they know who they are) what is so intellectual about The Last of the Mohicans? Did you see the word classic on the cover and decide that this must be intellectual and thought provoking? Come on! Its your standard no brainer adventure story! Im sure that if it was a modern book you wouldn't be so enthusiastic! I've saw modern melodramatic crap like this on the best sellers rack at Krogers. Tell me you read it for the senseless violence, or for the one dimensional characters, but please dont say you read it for intellectual reasons."
2,the last of the mohicans,"The Last of the Mohicans by J.Fenimore cooper. This book is a novel about a Native American tribe called the mohicans and their dying population. I didnt like this book at all. It wasn't that exciting, there wasn't that much fighting, and it never really grabed my attention. The plot never really appeared in the book untill a 1/3 of the way in. this book is like me because the Mohicans fought for what they belived in. i'd relate this book to the Cherokee Indians becaus they were forced out of their homes in the east coast and ended the trail in Oklahoma. In the Last of the Mohicans the Mohicans fought for their land and to survive. I would recommed this book to people who like history and peace between humans. I would also like to recommend this book to people who like Native American stories."
1,Third grader characterization,"This was the most awful book that I have ever read. The characterization in the book is lousy. I saw the movie and thought it was great. So, after seeing the movie, i decided to pick up the book. The movie has very little to do with the book. You never get a chance to really""feel"" the characters. Hawkeye, a main character in the movie, is seen in the book as only a small part. There is no vivd description to translate the action taking place. This book was awful, and I urge anyone thinking of reading it to avoid it."
4,"Good story, great illustrations!","The Last of the Mohicans is a classic in any form, but with Wyeth's illustrations, Cooper's story becomes a vivid tale of adventure, peril, and nobility long gone. I thoroughly enjoyed this book."
3,I found the book quite tedious to read and somewhat difficult to follow the characters. I thought the ending was quite good.,I found the book quite tedious to read and somewhat difficult to follow the characters. I thought the ending was quite good.
3,Dissapointed,"The book itself is very good. This copy lacks any references to the author, or the original copyright info. I had no indication of this when I chose this copy to purchase. If I can, I'll never purchase this product type again."
3,Cooper is an aquired taste,"I can't deny the importance of this novel, but in the end this book became more and more difficult to read. Cooper is EXCEPTIONALLY wordy and has a heavy storytelling hand. I can't say it was always boring but it just became sluggish in so many spots, with events dragged out and dialogue often unfit for the characters. Some think Cooper is torturous to read and I can see why. Make sure you have a lot of patience before you start this tale. You will be rewarded though. There are many undeniably exciting action scenes, however Cooper could have made this brisker and just as valid."
2,Awful,"While this book deserves some place in history for being an early work of American fiction and it's rich descriptions of early American geography, it is intensely hard to enjoy. The basic plotline is interesting, but the execution and character development is just plain awful. At many points in the book, Cooper just glosses over action leaving a confused reader wondering just what the hell happened and how. The real killer though is the character development. The unidimensional and shallow characters are stereotypes at best, and the women in the novel are written so thin they practically disappear. One might think that Cooper had never actually met a woman before given his portrayal. The book does have points to recommend it from a historical or geographical basis, but if anyone is actually looking for a good book to read, look elsewhere."
1,I officially hate this book!,"I, also, must second Mark Twain. This book is a waste of time! Why do teachers make us read it when we should be reading Tolkien, GK Chesterton, CS Lewis, and the like? Agh. Then, that could just be my wacky taste in novels...But this was bad. Oh my gosh!!! The descriptions were ALWAYS needlessly long, the conversations ALWAYS needlessly long, the... blah, blah, blah, blah. That's what the whole thing was. Blah. The whole plot could have been totally condensed to a hecka short 200 pg novel and it would have been a million times better! Maybe even good! And I like long books!This book is terrible. Listen to the warning of a fellow voracious reader and do not waste your time!!"
1,UGH!!,"What the hell, this book is BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!! I've always wanted to read this book, for some reason thinking dat it must be good, but the only thing this book did to me was make me loose points in my English class!! Ugh!!!!! I should've chosen the Time Machine instead! This book is just a bucket of senseless violence, pointless romance, totally unconvincing motives, and stereotyped characters. How could a novel be worse????"
2,"Interesting plot, that's about it","The Last of the Mohicans ranks on the lower tier of classics I have read. Cooper's style is tedious, and the captivating action scenes that are so abundant in the movie are few and far between in the novel. I will admit, I enjoy excerpts of Cooper's works, and the plot, if it wasn't so drawn out, would be engaging. You can spare yourself from 400 pages of monotony and excruciating discernment by just reading a couple of pages from the climactic scenes. Although I rarely do this, I can unhesitantly say that in this instance, the movie is far better than the book."
3,"A great book, but...","With the possible exception of Moby Dick, this book tested my stamina as a reader more than any other. Yes, it is a great adventure story but it is written in a convoluted prose style that was outdated in even Cooper's time. I was inspired to read this book by watching the Michael Mann film. If you go into this story expecting it to be sort of a novelization of the film, you'll probably be disappointed."
4,"Lasts all day long, great colors","I have a naturally pale skin, so I usually apply foundation and then blush on top, so I wouldn't look like a ghost. I tried many blushes before but they all tend to come off in couple of hours and I was tired of walking around with my blush all day long and put it on. They my friend told me about Estee Lauder Blush All Day and I bought it right away. Ever since I've been using it. It's great and the color stays all day long. They also have all kinds of different colors. It's a great value for the price."
1,UGH! The Bore Of Fang Rock!,"I have every available episode of Doctor Who on DVD. It should have been called the BORE of Fang Rock. This episode is like torture to watch. If I was to show someone that has never seen Doctor Who, this would be one i would HIDE! Just my opinion, It was SOOO SLLOOWW!! not much action. Some people really enjoyed it, but I guess I like a bit more action."
5,One of the best from the 4th Doctor,"This is a classic episode, which contains some brilliant one-liners from Tom Baker. The story devlops nicely, and good character development. The special effects are typical of the mid seventies - ie. cheesy. Ignore the effects, and get absorbed by the storyline. It's a great story and one to be in any collection."
5,One of the best Doctor Who shows ever!,As a beginning Dr. Who fan back in the late 1980's I was already hooked but this was the show that reeled me in. The Horror of Fang Rock is easily one of the best shows not only of Dr. Who but also in science fiction history. The Doctor arrives with his companion Leela near a lighthouse. Unknown to the inhabitants there is an unearthly creature lurking about determined to destroy all life on Earth. It is up to the Doctor to save the day!Clearly special effects were never Dr. Who's strong point and they certainly are not here in this episode as well but who needs them when a story is so well-written and as wonderfully acted as this episode is? I certainly plan on buying this dvd even though I already own the VHS copy.
5,A TOP NOTCH EPISODE,"This is the Doctor, and indeed Tom Baker, at his very best. This one was always one of my favorites and still is. Even after repeated viewings it still holds up. The story is well written and the characters are realistic. High marks also go to Louise Jameson's portrayal of Leela. She is in rare form here. Her child-like innocence is well played opposite her willingness for battle. The Horror of Fang Rock never lets you down. It's a fantastic story from start to finish. This episode, like the Doctor, stands the test of time."
1,Jr. High,This is the worse rap album I've heard in a long time. The lyrics have no meaning or message. It's just your basic Yo Yo Yo Word Up Ho. Buy Some classic Fat Pat.
2,"Interesting story premise, but didn't deliver","This was a great story ""idea"" but didn't deliver well on that idea. I wish the perspective of all characters were drawn out more and I couldn't understand why the nehphew was so scary and sickly (no explanation at all given). It just seems the book was rushed and could have been so much better with more development of their characters."
