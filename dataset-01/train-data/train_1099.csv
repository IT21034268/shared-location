2,Two solo cursed Careers&a so-so song,"Ralphael Saadiq is a average solo Artist at best. dude needs to get back with Tony,Toni,Tone like 5 minutes ago. He is a Talented Musician,but limited as a Solo Artist.songs like this&alot of his solo work is just kinda there. His vocals are kinda flat like Pancakes. Q-Tip: ain't never gonna hit his mark as a Solo Artist. Tribe still was His mark.He might do alright as a Hook Cat,but I can't see him making it as a solo Artist.both of these Cats solo Careers seem cursed to Me.they were both better suited in a Group Situation."
2,disappointed,"I probably bought this item for the wrong reasons. I saw the artist some time ago on a PBS program and was amazed with her music on the pipa. So I happened to see this item available and bought it on price. I suspect some of her traditional albums of Chinese music would be more pleasing. This album didn't work for me. Still, it was amazing to watch her play on that PBS program."
4,Torture of the Creature part III,"Third of the ""Creature"" movies, it is better than ""Revenge Of The Creature"" but not as good as the original ""Creature From The Black Lagoon"". The Creature is again captured and after being badly burned and near death, it is discovered he has lungs he has never used. Some minor surgery and he is now a land creature. He is also more manlike since his outer skin was burned off to reveal a different look. Well acted and a good classic monster movie. Im still waiting impatiently for this one as well as Revenge to make it to DVD...."
3,WORTH WATCHING!,"Again the gill man is captured and ends up going on a rampage, and killing people, AND falling in love with a human girl, AND!!!!, well I think you get it. Since the first film that formula hasn't changed. In REVENGE OF THE CREATURE nothing is different, but the movie is exciting enough and romantic enough to make you care about the same old story. But this movie barely keeps your intrest, and in the end actually almost makes you ashamed to be human. I won't give away way though. All in all this is a good movie but pales in comparisin to it's predesessors."
2,"Finally, the end of a series","I'll say one thing- the studio sure 'milked' this for all it was worth. The first episode of the 'Creature' was a big hit, and 2nd (Revenge of the Creature) did OK. But this last episode was pretty tame. But, then again, back in the 50's, sci-fi was top dog-right?"
4,The Creature Walks Among Us,Darwin would have loved this one:From fish to man in just three weeks.That's what I call entertainment.
5,Great Gryphon!,Tom Deitz is one of my favorite authors and the Gryphon king is a great stand alone book. This was the first book I read by Tom Deitz and have gone on to read many of his others. His character always seem real even when faced with not of this world situations. The characters in this book later participate in the last few books of the David Sullivan series. So if you are a fan of the Windmaster's Bane series of books this is a must read if you can find it used.
5,LOVE these shoes!,"This is my second pair of these shoes and I love them. The first pair I got at a running store and paid full price. Now that the GTS8 is out I came here to look for a bargain on the same shoes and ended up paying half the original price.They are very supportive, have lots of toe width but as with most running shoes I had to buy 1/2 to 1 size bigger than my normal. I would recommend them to anyone with a mid to high arch that tends to over pronate."
5,Reliable shoe,"I have had several pairs of Adrenalines and am always satisfied. They stand up to more miles than other brands. Amazon usually has better deals than you can find in stores, but beware that the shoe colors can be a little odd."
5,Brooks Adrenaline,I love these shoes. I have been wearing the same make and model for 10 years. They are the best runningshoes on the market. And Amazon's prices are the lowest I have ever found in the ten years I have been a loyal customer of Brooks!
4,Good overall running shoe,"I've tried many running shoes (I run marathons although would call myself an amateur runner), and by trial and error and advice of other runners found this shoe. Brooks Adrenaline is an all-around good shoe. Good support without being too tight through the toes. For long distance running I get 1 size larger than my regular shoes - I wear 6.5 and get 7.5 for running. I tie the laces all the way to the end to avoid my foot slipping forward and banging my toes. The GTS7 is an older model but got this for $30 less than the most recent model and honestly I haven't found they have changed much so it is a good value."
5,Great running shoe!,I love this shoe. This is my 3rd pair of this shoe and definitely not my last. They fit great and are comfortable. Highly recommend.
4,Running Shoe,I have found this shoe comfortable!! It has definitely suited my use. I only would prefer to have a solid whiteshoe.
5,Brooks Women's Adrenline running Shoe,The shoe is very comfortable. Had heel spur pain one year ago. The good shoes relieved the pain.The price was even greater. Thank you....
2,too small for running or walking,"Seemed like a well made shoe, but way too small-probably need a whole size larger."
2,feels like a poor quality running shoe,"I would not buy this running shoe again, feels like a cheap pair of everyday sneakers"
5,"Great shoe, good price","I love the Brooks Adrenaline because I don't feel injured after I run in them. I am in intermittent runner, I don't run far distances, but I am prone to shin splints and joint pain after just a little running. I think that Brooks makes a superior product."
2,Not as good as the GTS 6,"I always buy the same running shoe - the Brooks Adrenaline GTS 6. Unfortunately that style has been discontinued so it has been difficult to find. I thought that the GTS 7 would probably be pretty much the same, maybe even better so I decided to try it.It's not a terrible shoe, but I think the GTS 6 is much better. I do a lot of long runs and the GTS 7 doesn't have as much cushioning. It actually feels like the GTS 6 after about 200 miles of running. I think it would probably be better for shorter distances like 2-3 miles or walking."
4,Keith's vocals live on,"Wherever You Are To Night is a collection of previously unreleased material from the late Keith Whitley. The title track is a touching balad about the memories of lost love that shows just how powerful Keith's voacls are. Then there are the up beat tunes such as ""Tell Me Something I Didn't Know"" and ""Just How Bad Do You Wanna Feel Good"" thats sure to get your feet a tappin'. Even though Keith Whitley's death was all to sudden his emotional and powerful sound can still be felt in this album. It's a must have for any Keith Whitley fan."
3,Gnattali Sexteto,"Radames Gnattali (1906-1993) was a Brazilian composer, arranger and pianist who spent much of his career writing for radio and television. He was also classically trained, so he had a foot in a couple of different worlds. He had a way with tunes and some of his best stuff is very enjoyable, but this recording isn't a very good example. There are only eight tracks and while the players are good, the arrangements are weird, with periodic interpolations of accordion or harmonica, or very clearly overdubbed strings. Some of it would make pleasant listening if the production values weren't so poor. One of those things that sounds like it was thrown together out of earlier vinyl recordings."
3,make sure of size,"be careful when ordering this, i bought these thinking they would fit my mustang. Two weeks later I went to install them only to find out they are sized for a 17 inch wheel..."
4,One of my fav's for learning Italian,"I've bought several books to learn italian over the last year or so and while I don't believe any one book will make you fluent, or even close, this one makes a great effort. It's a fun read, with lots of great info, what I find most useful is the little insights they give you into slang, the natural ways people speak and life in italy. The scenarios are humorous, which makes them fun to read and there's plenty of exercises, examples and great explanations for grammar. The accompanying cd is full of dialogue that is slow enough for a beginner to follow, and if they can't, there are transcriptions. I highly recommend this book as a supplement to self learning. You definitely want to pick up something that focuses more on grammar, and get perhaps a dictionary/flashcards for vocab, but this is a great tool for learning more natural speech, and getting explanations for some things that perhaps other books drop the ball on."
2,Too chatty,"This is part of the annoying new trend of publishing foreign language textbooks that give more space to chatting at you about learning the language than to actually teaching you the language. So much of the book consists of this chatting that it provides the learner with very little practice in the language, when you consider the amount of time spent with the book.If you want an inexpensive book that will actually teach you the language, consider ""Italian the Easy Way"" or ""Italian Now!"""
5,Heavenly and a Revelation,"I first found out about this book when I saw a rave review of it with a beautiful sample image in ""i-D"" magazine's October '05 issue. Then I advance ordered it from Amazon, and received it today.One word: Heavenly - Two words: Big and BeautifulNot only is this book an incredible artistic statement by ""one of the most important and influential photographers of the last 50 years"" (quoting Staticmag.com), The pure and simple subject being only clouds is a revelation!Clouds from the perspective rarely seen in photographs, from within the clouds, above the clouds, and amongst the clouds. In the entire book there is rarely a view of terra firma at all. - This is probably the most exclusive and certainly the most beautiful book of cloud images ever made. Not so much for scientists, but for dreamers. You will love this book."
5,Looking head on,"Glen E. Friedman is an artist that keeps us off our heels. In RECOGNIZE, we find ourselves in a familiar place, off the busy streets, and looking head-on at what we often let pass overhead and unnoticed. We all have been there, more concerned with the destination rather than being in the moment and enjoying the window seat. So few of us have really stopped to look. Thankfully, Glen has captured fleeting moments of weightless bliss on film. Paging through RECOGNIZE is like hitting the slow-motion button on a film that we never really understood because it was going by our eyes on fast-forward. After floating through Glen's latest, you'll undoubtedly recall what you saw on your next trip to the sky. Hopefully you'll remember to slow things down and recognize the beauty this time."
3,So-so,"While not too interesting, it still had a few spots of interest. The flow of the book was good but it needed more plot depth and developement for me to really get into it. Overall, I liked it.If you like books like this one, might I suggest another I've recently come across. The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. It's another fantasy adventure sure to please. I highly recommend it."
1,Hasbeen strikes again!,They really should've stayed with board games. Their programmers all got straight A's (in retentive).
4,Off the Hook,This novel held my attention as I became involved in the lives of the characters. As a first time effort I think I'll be reading more from this author......
4,"Very Good, But Slightly Weaker Than Previous","Moenia sort of goes back to the mellow pop electronic sound from their debut, and it is a nice album, but there aren't as many great songs as we are used to.On all past recordings just about every song is super catchy, but on this one, only about 5 are like that. That having been said, the tune ""Espirales"" is excellent as is ""¿En Qué momento?"" also ""Traicion"" is like an electronic oldwest cowboy tune which is pretty cool.Moenia still has a great sound and they have a magical way of bringing out beautiful sensations from their music, and the lyrics as always are not political or protest, rather they complement the music by being simple and conentrating on the fragil human condition and everyday emotions. Overall I reccomend this album, although it is not quite as strong as the others, also if you are more a fan of their more aggressive material, this might disappoint as it is more ""pop""."
3,"Moenia ""Televisor""","Hi well i was expecting any work from Moenia and having listen to the single ""En que Momento"" wich sound like the old style MOENIA i thought it was going to be the old Moenia beats and songs i loved to listen in ""Clubs and the Radio "" and in which almost everyone new and sang the lyrics to the songs but I have to say this wasn't the case as with ""LE MODULOR"", I think it lacks those good ELECTRO-POP beats they so much talk about.This CD WAS A COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT.I only liked 4 maybe 5 songs on the entire cd.I just wish they could come out with such hits like in ""Adicion""which I think was the best album produce by them.For me: MY MONEY IS WITH ""MORBO"".""MORBO""has the sound and pop ritm im looking for which ""Moenia"" forgot or doesnt have anymore."
5,one to remember!!!!,"This book was writtten so incredibly beautifull!!!!I would recommened this book to teens, even if they don't like to read because its funny and it also portrays the reality of life and the harshness anerexia and bulimia cause. what i love about it most is that its REALISTIC! Most books lack originality. YOu cry laugh and keeps you glued to the pages it s worth 10 stars !!!!! its a must read book!!"
1,Misrepresentation,"Patricia S Klein has simply taken excerpts, in this case, from various CS Lewis publications, selected a title under the AUTHORSHIP of CS Lewis which is simple misrepresentation as she cashes in on the name of CS Lewis to her own personal benefit. Please read the real CS Lewis and not the excerpts from CS Lewis."
2,Not what I was looking for.,"I didn't want to buy a blank notebook for a garden journal, hoping that someone had developed a more efficient method of keeping track of the various info. Sadly this garden journal was a huge let down. It's still usable but I don't really care for how they decide to structure the layout."
1,Crap!,What the hell happened to this band. I liked all their stuff until this steaming turd was released.
1,Kept sending wrong one,"I ordered this for a 2002 Dodge Ram 2500, but they shipped me the dash mat for the 1500 two different times. After the mistake the second time, they refunded my money. Customer Service was great, they just couldn't get me the correct dashmat."
2,Only For Die Hards,"With Perverse, Mike Edwards set out to prove that Jesus Jones was more than a `sunny, breezy pop band', what he ended up proving was that if they weren't no one was interested. Sad to say, but pop hooks were what people expected from JJ, and actually there are some here, but they are smothered by industrial/techno gook. Stick with DOUBT, that's where JJ peaked, even if some claimed they had `sold out'. Here they are pushing the boundaries, but that doesn't always make for a great listening experience."
3,No Surprises - Just What You Would Expect,This was an OK movie. Professionally done but as hard as it is to imagine there is nothing new here. This is a truly tragic story at every level but I just don't find it entertaining. I think it is intended to be a story of hope - if so it just doesn't work as I was only depressed by what I saw.
3,Abortionist going waaay back,"Movie was okay, but to say she saved thousands of lives? C'mon, she actually killed thousands of lives. All those babies she murdered... I was expecting to feel sympathy after reading the reviews, but how could you. She was an abortionist: plain and simple. She was just as bad as Hitler himself; worse even, she was a Jew. We all try to tell others and outselves ""we weren't there"" or ""he/she would have done the same."" But really? To kill babies? She should be tried as a war criminal. She collaboreted with the enemy. During war, collaboratores get shot as traitors. But I guess abortionists and their de-humanizing views makes them sleep better at night. Okay movie, but sadistic central person."
3,Let it go already!,"There's no question that the Jews suffered tremendously during this period, but please let's remember that so did everyone else (from the Chinese to the Gypsies). This horse has already been beaten beyond death and will ultimately create a sarcasm from the rest of the world, if it hasn't already. The exerted accents were difficult to follow and clearly gave the impression that the ""Jewish"" actors were trying too hard. Worth watching once."
5,full moral ambiguity with heart,"When we bought this, I thought, ""not another holocaust film!"" So there it sat for months, unopened. Then last night, I finally got the courage to try watching it, and became utterly rivetted and deeply moved.This is the true story of a remarkable survivor, a doctor from Auschwitz, who suffered the loss of her entire family and took many questionable actions to survive. While saving many lives, she also dealt with Mengele and felt that she had violated her oath as a doctor. She is not a simple good guy, but a full-blown character who acknowledges the necessity of her actions and yet feels terrible guilt. Lahti delivers the best performance I have ever seen her give, not as the beautiful young woman she is but prematurely aged and worn. She is totally believable and charismatic.Though made for TV, this is a great film. Warmly recommended. You will be moved yet again by the one of greatest trajedies of the 20C."
2,Please please please read her book first,"I have read dozens and dozens of books regarding the Hungary Jews during WW2. Dr. Perl's book is by far the most moving I have read to date. When I learned of a movie I searched everywhere for it. After watching the film I was extremely disappointed. I am fully aware that the ""movie-into-book"" films are normally no where near as good; this was the worst I have yet to see. Most of what occurs in the movie did not occur in the book, and the things that were taken from the book were inaccurate. Even the ending ""camp"" scene at the end of the movie is completely inaccurate. I would say, as far as a rating for simply the film by itself, it is entertaining enough, around a 7/10. However, as a movie that was made from an incredible autobiographical novel regarding Auschwitz and Dr. Perl's experiences there, the movie gets a 4/10 at best."
5,Out of the Ashes,Loved the movie. It's one of the great movies we all should own.We received it in just a few days after we placed the order. Amazon is a great place to order anything from.
5,Educator,I have viewed this movie and it was well worth watching it. It is so real that I cried. I recommend this movie to anyone who is studying the Holocaust or is interested in the injustices of humanity. One can choose to do well in life for survival while others do not understand or will never understand why we made these choices in our lives. Truly an amazing movie!
5,A double tragedy...,"""Out of the Ashes"" is a gripping true story of a Jewish female obstetrician who survived the Holocaust, and saved the lives of hundreds of female prisoners, only to be savaged when she finally emigrated to the United States by both a bureaucratic system and latent anti-semitism among the commissioners who reviewed her application for citizenship to enable her to practice here. Difficult to watch at times due to content, despite the fact that it won an Oscar for cinematography, the truth is often tough to swallow. It is the story of a woman who became a doctor over parental objections, who aborted hundreds of women to save them from Nazi extermination, and who survived only to be savaged when she finally made it to the U.S."
4,"""Out of the Ashes"" - a true story","""Out of the Ashes"" is one of the many stories from the holocaust Nazi. As it is a real life story, it's amazing to know what Jewish people needed to do to survive and helping others to survive. It really makes you think on life's injustices and the willing of human nature to keep struggling, even in the hardest circumstances where everything might look dark. I recommend it amply.Iñigo P.B."
5,Out of the Ashes,"Out of the Ashes was a terrific depiction of the horrific depiction of the Nazi behavior pertaining to the Jewish destruction. It clearly displays the need for WW II and how important it was to win the war even though we lost about 450,000 soldiers. It also demonstrates the necessity to defend a defenseless people against such atrocities and to leave a memory for those who were very young or not yet born so they are able to see a need for war in such a time as this was.Bill Jackson"
5,Exceptional story telling,"One of the most ""moving"", emotional movies I've seen since Schindler's List. The cinematography is breath taking, great directing and Christine Lahti has never been better. Some scenes are difficult to watch due to the cruel events of that time, but a viewing experience you won't soon forget."
3,Compelling story; average movie,"1. It almost anathema to write anything negative about the Holocaust, however this is one of those movies where the actual story & book is much much better than the movie. With that being said, if one hasn't read the book--> at least watch the movie.2. The main criticism I have about the movie is that of the acting; the principal character portrays the doctor as being so arrogant and amazingly narcissistic... which is just difficult to watch at times. Otherwise, a decent movie--> but again, please read the book."
5,One of the Best Albums...Ever!,"Kenny Chesney sings one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard with ""Grandpa Told Me So"".Perhaps I'm a little biased, having been raised by my grandparents, Jacob and Louise Flaton, but this song is so deep and heartfelt that it illustrates one of the most important qualities that music can do; it lifts your soul to heights of joy that cannot be expressed in words.Kenny, if you're reading this, I want you to know that I LOVE THIS ALBUM! Well done! Very well done!"
5,HYPNOTIC!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!,"This CD is amazing! LAKUNA takes you on a wonderful journey with it's hypnotic beats! It has something for everyone. Tracks 1 through 5 build up to Track 6 ""SO HAPPY"" - which is the peak for this CD. The drums by DAVE NARCIZO are unbelievable on all songs but especially this one! Songs 7 and 8 are the icing on this cake! Track 8 ""THE VERY NEXT DAY"" is just beautiful! Track 2 ""VEGA"" is very gothic and haunting. BRAVO to this new artist! Everyone involved with the making of this CD is obviously extremely talented! I hope they continue to make this incredible music!"
4,Best Instrumental album in a long while,"I haven't heard a great instrumental album along these lines since Trans Am's ""Surrender To the Night"". Hard driving drumming over nice loops and synth hooks. Almost old-school in it's apporach to the synths, but with actual drumming laid down on top of it. Sounds like background music for a great film."
5,Stunning novel,"Vuk Draskovic, a gifted writer, eloquently reveals the emotional and mental anguish that comes with the gruesome violence in the Balkans over the centuries. Dismissed as too nationalistic by some, the novelist is stunning in his brilliant ability to make the reader feel the anguish and uncertainty of the characters. One comes away from the novel clearly seeing the cause of the Muslim/Christian conflict in the former Yugoslavia and the dangers of political polarization. A cautionary tale for these times of increasing political polarization in the United States."
5,LEARN THE BUDWIG PROTOCOL ON DVD,"If you have, or are purchasing Dr. Johanna Budwig's cookbook, but wish to learn the full healing protocol, take a look at the DVD as well:A Day in the Budwig Diet - Learn the complete home healing protocol to prevent and heal cancer, arthritis, heart disease & more"
3,Healthy diet,"I received this book quicker than expected. It was in good shape. My health necessitated a major change in diet, and Dr. Budwig's cancer protocol was my choice. I ordered her cookbook for additional ideas, some of which were helpful, some not."
1,Was not what I expected,This book does not give much information.I thought it was advice by Dr Budwig..since that is the way it is described. It is mostly recipes of salads and foods that we every day people dont eat on an everyday basis. I found it boring.I got more from her website.
2,The Oil Protein Diet Cookbook,"Just perusing the book, the recipes seem unedible and difficult to incorporate into one's diet. There are ingredients that I've NEVER heard of! The book is a disappointment because I was expecting simple, tasty uses of flax seed oil in combination with food I'm familiar with."
5,"The Oil Protein Diet Cookbook, by Johanna Dr. Budwig","This book is the companion to her first book. While the first book is really a compilation of her various lectures to peers over a long span of years, this book actually explains in more detail how her diet works and also suggests diets that are nutritious to the point of being adequate for athletes in training. If I had to choose ""one"" this would be IT. As a cancer victim myself you can read my review of the other book about how well her diet works. Buying this book and following her diet will be the best investment in your own health you will ever make. Buy and read both her books, but especially this one."
1,Oil Protein Diet Cookbook,"The book arrived in good shape, and we received it fairly soon, but it was the book itself we were very disappointed with. We are following the Bill Henderson Cancer plan, and had hoped this book would help us with some menus. However, there was only one in the whole book that we could use."
1,Not what I expected,I was very disappointed. I thought that it would gomore into how foods contribute to our health.I wasexpecting some detail around this subject.Ymelda M De Vargas
3,Life is unpredictable,"Life is strange. We generally know what should be good for us and what could cause problems, but it isn't always that simple. Some people live clean, healthy lives, but because of some factors they can't control they become ill and die. Others smoke, drink, have unprotected sex, and should be dead before they hit 30, but they manage to live until their 90's.The fact is you should enjoy life, but try to keep things in moderation. It would stink to avoid fats, sugars, animal protein, and do everything you can, but then come down with a horrible illness.I think one trick is to enjoy life and have things to live for, such as family, doing some good, fun hobbies, and allow yourself to indulge here and there without guilt."
5,Good quality rolling pin.,This is a very high quality rolling pin perfect for lefse and other flat breads. We use this every year at Christmas.
5,Rolling Pin,This appreared to be a quality product when received. It was a gift to someone who wants to make Lefse.
2,Deep in Techno-land,"Garmarna continues down the path they plotted with ""Vengeance,"" and is now very far into electronic/techno land. The overall feel of this disk, like ""Vengeance"" is very sedate, contemplative, airy. The techno rhythms and looped samples clash with the Emma Hardelin's delivery of the songs. This disk was an interesting concept that, unfortunately, was not realized effectively."
3,Interesting but not my favourite,"you can't raelly relate this to the rest of Garmarna's wonderful mediaeval scandanavian folk music, because it's nothing of the sort. It's mostly somewhat Enigma-like gregorian chant accompanied by Garmarna's signature fiddles and drums. I love Emma to death but her pronunciation of latin is almost embarassing. Interesting, and a pretty cool idea, but not my favourite album."
4,"Strong, Soulful Delivery","""The Best of Me"" may have come out in the late 90's but it's getting heavy rotation on my CD player right now. Andrea Martin is so talented yet is virtually unknown in the R&B world. Why mainstream radio skips over talented songstess such as this is a wonder to me.The upbeat tempo on these tracks are really contatious. I'm diggin' her version of ""Sorry"". The only thing I'm not so moved by is the Rap addition on the track ""Set It Off.""I, for one, truly hope that it won't be long before Andrea comes out w/her Sophomore CD."
2,Sizing was wrong,"Not sure what the problem was, but this suit was about 4 sizes too small. We buy this size suit often for both my kids so I know the size was correct from my end. Other than the size, the suit looked nice. Good stitching and good quality fabric."
2,Not the best example of the genre.,"The Planets seem to have a problem deciding what they'l be. Are they a band that puts a rock twist on classical? Are they a bloated chamber orchestra? Are they a rather sparse symphony? What is on this album is a good example of mediocrity. If you want good poppy classical music, check out Vanessa Mae. If you want good classical music, look at the scores of albums arranged by truly great composers. The Planets try hard and fall flat. Perhaps in another couple of albums they'll have found their voice, but it certainly isn't on Classical Graffiti"
2,"Has potential, but lacks direction","The CD opens with a fantastic adaption of Rodrigo but goes downhill from there. Too many of the tracks have a generic, slow, elevator music sound to them, something I would not have expected from a CD produced and arranged by Mike Batt. Other tracks lack direction and come off as poor imitations of Vanessa-Mae. The Planets' rendition of Contradanza, a piece composed by Mike Batt originally for Vanessa-Mae, makes my ears bleed.If you're a fan of classical crossover (as I am), this CD is still worthwhile to own. ""Rodrigo"" and ""Classical Graffiti"" show the potential of this group if they can develop more of a style and tackle some tougher material. Buy it with the caveat that you're not going to find the same creativity or dynamism as with the early albums from Vanessa-Mae or Bond.If you're looking for more of an introduction to good classical crossover music, pick up Vanessa-Mae's ""The Violin Player"" and Bond's ""Born"" instead."
5,The Planets- Bravo!,"OK, so the other review was less than favorable. Here's the other side of the coin: If you like this genre of music (Vanessa Mae, Bond etc.), you should love this CD. Spearheaded by Michael Batt (again, Vanessa Mae and Bond), The Planets offer a far better version of this genre of music than Bond's second album, or Vanessa's most recent CD. Bond's latest is FLAT and uninspired- they're more interested in selling their ""look"" than creating interesting music. The Planets' music is fresh, with a great deal of dimensionality- exiciting- classical, jazz, rock, West Side Story, Jethro Tull, Carmen (etc.); there's a little of all of them in there. I've listened to this CD over and over again and still thrill to it (while Bond sits on the shelf). I think The Planets know EXACTLY what they are, and I hope to hear a lot more from them in the future."
2,Great talent ruined by terrible songs,"It is obvious that they have a lot of talent. The first song has a lot of energy and is quite good. But after that, the tempo of all the songs is moderato at the fastest. Most of the songs that were chosen were just to slow of songs. It does not match up to the caliber of Bond, where I thought it would have."
5,Amazing!!!,"This guy is probably my favorite rapper now. Up until I heard StL, Biggie and Pac were the best I had ever heard, which is saying a lot. Christian music is new and improved -- now with subterranean hip-hop. More importantly, though, StL is theologically spot on. His music will definitely help to lead his listeners to the truth. Powerful ministry. Big ups!"
2,Too much focus on the mathematics,"I miss the step to practice and would like to see these mathematical formulas work. For me it contained too much (unuseful) mathematics and proofs. Good maybe for mathematicians, but for banking people on the edge of being unreadable. It is very time consuming to browse more then 500 pages and then still to have to work out all details to implement things. Also the stochastic volatily models are too briefly covered."
2,Not a great book.,"As someone in the business, I had been using Exam Cram and Transcender to gain MCSE. Based on reviews, this book was recommended. However, I didn't particularly care for its style or content. Whereas EC was straight forward and direct, this book tended to be more ""recipe"" checklist than useful for understanding IIS."
4,DYNAMITE,This book really covers the exam-if you want to pass then use this book.Not as a sole source but as a good reference and you will pass. Highly recommended
3,"Best book out there, but you should use it with others.",One book is definately not enough for the IIS4.0 exam. I used the New Riders book and then read this book. It gives a very good overview and the exam questions at the end of the book are very good. As everyone else says you need hands on experience. I used the test success books for all my 6 exams so they worked for me.
4,A good tool to pass the test,This is a good book that is definitely one of the better resources to pass the IIS 4.0 test. Being that IIS 4 is one of the new MCSE demonstrative tests it should not be taken lightly as people have taken IIS in the past. It is not that IIS 4 is a terribly difficult subject but the testing style is certainly a new experience from Microsoft. This is a good resource and as always this book is broken up into categories just like the real test so you can focus on your weak areas. I would definitely recommend this book. Only problem is that it does not always go into enough detail but it is only to be used as a part of a study curriculum and not a sole piece of material. This book does a good job of referring to additional materials if further clarification is needed. Another good book from Sybex.
5,Great book to complete your MCSE!,"This book is covered with all material you need to pass. I scored 900 with this book. Forget the books with 500 pages plus, this is accurate and takes you through all the steps for practical study at home. The questions are not much help though. But have given this book five stars because it has all the important information to pass."
3,Good for a review the day before the test.,"I found on this book answers to some questions I didn't find in others 500 pages books. Brief and concise. Great for that last day review. But, don't depend on it alone to pass the test, that's not the objective."
1,Should have known...,"Who doesn't love LITTLE BILL for the pre-school mind? I received the book in a timely manner, and at a good price. I should have known, for a low price (amazingly) and about $5 dollar in shipping, I received a VERY worn book, with drawing on pages by a child, and ripped, and missing pages. I should have thought better to ever buy ""used"". I expected used to be that a child's name would be written in the front cover, a note maybe by the person who had given the child the book, and for the book to have a non-fresh look. To say the least, it went to Good Will due to it not being in any shape for bedtime readings. Maybe someone will want it for cutting out pictures, but as a book--pass."
5,Van doesn't care what you think.,"He doesn't care what anyone thinks. He doesn't care what critics, fans, or producers think about him or his music. His music is his own and it will not be influenced by anyone. Thank God! Just like Dylan, Van makes music for music's sake only; not for fame or fortune. If only today's dreadful pop stars could make the music as important as the videos, clothes, hair, fame, and fortune, we would all benefit greatly. Take time to learn more about Van Morrison, his music, his roots, and his influences and you will go on a musical journey that will change you forever. This CD is a nice, accessible start, but there is much more to be unearthed. Van is truly one of the 10 most important rock artists of all-time. Will you find many people that admit this? No, because Van won't sell out and play the political games."
3,He sounds grumpy,"To say this album is mediocre is about the best I can do. Believe me, I want to love it, but just can't. Don't get me wrong, the songs are alright, but he just sounds alot of the time like he's going the motions, and in some cases, like he was in a foul mood on the day of recording and it took a superhuman effort to get himself to come across not sounding like he was in a foul mood.It also contains a lyric about the internet, one of Van's worst moments, if not the worst. Van Morrison should be singing about Rolling Hills, Ancient Haunts, or Lords & Gurus...whatever .... NOT THE INTERNET!!! Ouch..."
3,Not Much New Here,"In regards to previous post- Unfortunately, Dweller on the Treshold's ""amazingly catchy tune"" - not High Summer's"
5,He does it once again!!!,"I've been a Van Morrison fan since he was with ""Them"" and I have never been more pleased with any of his work as I am with this.... I loveyou, Van!!"
4,A Quality Mixture,"Lyrically, *Back On Top* revisits several comfortable Morrison metaphors--gardens, exile, mountain tops, autumn, the prickly nature of fame. The rhyme stuctures are always a treat in Van's work, along with the imagery of time and place, and this CD is no different. Musically, the sound withdrawals a bit from the blues and jazz-based structures of recent albums, for the better in my opinion.A couple of the selections are a bit long and brooding, though the rest are a fine mixture of up-beat, assertive stuff. ""Precious Time"" is probably the strongest cut, along with ""New Biography,"" with its sly allusions to other VM songs.*Hymns to Silence* is still my favorite Morrison CD. Just a plug."
4,"strange message, good music","Van is indeed back on top. This is an excellent cd, but his lyrics are a bit strange. Morrison has gotten into a new age or Freemason type of mode when it comes to message. But, the music and the voice are in top form. Even if some of the lyrics are disturbing, this cd is worth having for the Van Morrison fans. Superior to his last few seeforts. Those were good, but this one rises above them. Just keep you ear and mind open to the message and be discerning."
4,The Amazon.com star rating system is not calibrated for Van.,"The man they call ""The Man"" has made 'one star' records the value of which transcend most artists 'five star' efforts. On first listen this seemed to me a little too familiar, themes and melodies reminiscent of any of the non-jazz studio albums of the last decade. It seemed to be in a different league from The Healing Game, somehow less serious, less worked-out, almost thrown out to his new label without the usual care and attention. However, my initial ideas have been confounded by repeated plays. This record is as rich and pensive as any, but seemingly happier and more upbeat. Fine Van."
3,Not My Favorite Collection,"This collection won't become my play it over and over again, Van Morrison. He is a great talent, this one just doesn't grab me."
2,get back to basics van,this cd is one of his worst which is better than anything out there now its ok couple good songs i listen to this one the least and i am his biggest fan lose the hat and shades van shave the head get some earrings and tats and go nuts
4,No middle ground...,"I think you either ""get"" Van Morrison or you don't. If you are a fan, you will appreciate this album and love it for what it is - Classic Van. If not, then Back on Top won't win you over. Goin' Down Geneva is a fun opener, a little more straight-up blues than your average Van Morrison song. It's catchy, but a tad too ""clean"" sounding - I prefer my blues a little muddier. Philosopher's Stone is too bland for my taste and some find the lyrics condescending, but once past this song the rest of the album is great. High Summer has one of the most haunting harmonica riffs I've heard - it sticks in your head for days, but not in an unpleasant way. Reminds Me of You is so full of regret and sadness that you can't help but be a little moved by it. Precious Time and New Biography are a little more upbeat, but a listen to the lyrics will jolt you a bit - Not the happiest I've ever heard. All in all, it's a very enjoyable listen and more than worthwhile, especially for long-time fans."
4,Hypnotizing,"While I have always liked Van Morrison's beautiful voice and knew his big hits ( Moondance, Tupelo Honey, Brown-Eyed Girl) I had never heard an entire album of his until this one. I have listened to this CD every day for the past week and cannot get enough of the haunting Philosopher's Stone. Also love When the Leaves Come Falling Down, Golden Autumn Day, Precious Time.I will say that the first time I heard the album, I was not thrilled. But I decided to give the album another listen and liked it more and more each time I heard it. As a long-time Dylan fan it is a rare album by another artist that I want to hear over and over but this one qualifies. I just ordered Moondance; have to check out VM a bit more.The bonus song ""Valley of Tears"" is a treat.(written by Fats Domino)"
5,Van Morrison at his finest,"It's a new label but it's still Van Morrison. He continues to put out more albums this decade alone than most artists have put out in their lifetime. Van's got nothing else to prove musically. ""Back on Top"" flows similar to ""The Healing Game"" but better. It's more creative with instruments such as organs, harmonicas and horns. A must have for Van fans, you won't be disappointed."
4,I thought it is great,I like this cd but some other Van Morrison fans thought it wasn't his best work. I do think it could've been better but it still rank with his other great cd's
5,Best effort ever by Mr. Morrison. Bravo!!!,"The feeling seems to really come through as Van performs pieces you can sense he's having fun doing. It's the music he's always wanted to record, not just what the studio thought would sell and he gives the show of his life. Great stuff!!"
5,Van is the Man!!!!!!!!!!!!,I love this album. I recommend it highly to anyone who has ever been into Van's music.
3,Stuck in a rut,"I've been listening to Van since Brown-Eyed Girl was a new radio hit in '67. He's good all the time with flashes of brilliance every so often: Astral Weeks, St. Dominic's Preview, Into the Music, No Guru..., Enlightenment, and Hymns to the Silence. In ""Hymns,"" he seemed to be closing the book on his mystical, spiritual creations. After listening to that album, I knew he was about to change gears. His work since then has been pretty repetitive, and I keep hoping he'll create another album that makes you go ""whoa!""--an album that you can't help but play over and over for years. He has good stuff on this new album--Philosopher's Stone, Midnight, Reminds me of you, and Golden Autumn Day are strong Van cuts. The string section in Golden Autumn Day sends chills up my spine. The rest of the stuff...well. To put it in perspective, a mediocre Van album is still better than most of the stuff others are doing. --Tom DeZego"
1,"Yes please ""FIX"" them","I hope someone ""fixes"" this lame band so they cannot poison the world with more lame, no talent, pathetic music."
1,Not available for All readers,Went to download this title for my Kindle reader on my iPad and no such luck. What is with new restriction for only having titles available for Kindle Fire and Android only. I have found that my daughter loves to read on my iPad but now I may be limited on what I can download.
1,Always a five star...,Cynthia Rylant is absolutely amazing. My granddaughter loves all the Henry and Mudge books I have purchased for her. Keep up the good work Cynthia. Always a 5 star with myself and my granddaughter.
5,Good,"My son's words, "" I like the book because it has a dog and its name is nudge and I have a dog named Annie"" This is a cute story I would have rated it a 4. My son is 7"
2,Fun but not engrossing long term...,"Initially this game presented a new look and feel to on-line gaming for me. However, it soon lost its luster. I think it would be great for those with an interest in the comic book genre and super hero themes. These themes simply are not my cup of tea."
3,"It's fun, for a while... but it gets boring.","I bought this game for my husband for Christmas. He enjoyed it enough that I bought a copy for myself. I enjoyed it for about 10 levels. Then it got boring. Typically, I am a hack & slash player, but I still require a story of some sort. And this game did not have sufficient story to keep me interested.Yes, the graphics are pretty cool. Yes, the costume permutations are seemingly endless. But, I let my subscription expire after only 2 months, and moved on to World of Warcraft."
5,City Of Heroes,This is the most addicting game I have ever played and they keep updating the game almost weekly. It cost $15.00 a month to play this On-Line Game andI never thought I would play an On-line game but I play it every nightHighly RecommendedA+ Rating
1,An Absolute Rip-Off,"This game sounds like a whole lot of fun, but what you need to know is that it is a subscription game. ie if you don't agree to pay $15 a month then it won't work!! You do get the first 30 days free but after that expect to be paying out $$$. My kids were very disapointed and you would think that having purchased the DVD they would at least give you some version of the game that you could play for no extra cost...."
1,FORGET IT!,"This seems like a great game and all but I'm NOT going to pay a monthly bill just to play a game, no matter how good it is!I was just thinking about buying this game too.:("
4,A good game gets even better!,"I love this game. New in this version is Powersliding, which is a real fun travel power your character starts with, which is somewhat faster than Sprint.The graphics are phenomenal, and I even enjoy the game music. It's become my addiction as I try out different characters and work on building them up and fighting crime in Paragon City.The one down side to the game is that it's a pay subscription to play ($15.00/month), but the moderators and tech support are so great that it's worth it in my opinion. Servers are maintained on a regular basis as well."
1,poor craftmanship,I would not reccommend this rolling pin. It is rough and before I could use it my husband had to sand the surface and the indentations to remove splinters
1,Near Mama's Heart a heartfelt tribute to mamas and their nurslings.,"Easy-to-read text on brightly colored pages alternate with photographs of nursing babies. Its simple yet engaging prose written from a baby's point-of-view keeps a wee one listening as mommy or daddy read along. And best of all, its depictions span a wide range of breastfeeding mothers, their babies, children and in a way that normalizes breastfeeding and reinforces the concept that breast really is best for all."
4,Funny true book,I bought this as a gift for friends that became new parents - it is an amusing look at raising children!
5,A fun review for grandparents and parents,"This is a cute little book that will provide a great review for parents and grandparents about what it means to be a toddler.The chapters include Updates for Home and Transportation (this was written in 2005, so some of this info is most likely outdated). Chapter two contains General Care and Handling and gives some good ideas for comforting a child, suggestions for toys and travel. Chapter three gives a humorous overview of ""Understanding the Toddler's Power Supply"" which concentrates on eating and food. Programming the Sleep Mode, chapter four, talks about sleeping patterns. Chapter five concentrates on ""General Maintenance and Training"" such as reprogramming the child from diapers to ""self-waste disposal."" You'll find charts and more in Chapter six about ""Growth and Development."" Chapter seven includes some realistic and proven techniques for ""Discipline."" Chapter eight concentrates on emergencies and safety."
4,"No Fluff, Great Stuff","I purchased this book a long time ago and read through it. There's no stories about someone else's brat and what they did with them to keep them happy and in-line... there's not cutsie stories about who their toddlers puked on after eating too much cake...What DOES it have? Great, standard and (most important of all) USEFUL information presented in a comical but simple manner. Great gift for dads who just can't make it through the 500 pages of the other books which are 490 pages of stories about the author's child and 10 pages of actual things you can use.These books aren't not just a wonderful compendium of good, standard information you should know, but they are wonderfully entertaining at the same time."
4,DH got a good laugh over this book,"My husband is a bit on the techy side, so I thought this would be a good book to get him to try to read to get our dd through her toddler years. He often chuckles when he is reading it and seems to enjoy it. That being said, it isn't a book that I really find interesting, so I think it's really geared towards manual type people."
2,Better off Learning on your own,"just like the baby manual which i also have it is simple.You can get more advice from friends , family and the pediatrician even websites. I guess I wish that the manual had more info an was way bigger than it was because truth be told kids are nice but they are a handful especially when your dealing with more than 2.Learning on your own is better any way and much more fun ."
3,Not a bad book for a first time parent,"The ""manual"" language, though amusing at first and funny, does get to you. When you are looking for some real tips for some real problems, you just want to read it in normal language. But it does contain valuable information. However, keep in mind that more often than not, you have little time to read when you've got toddler(s) in your hands. :)"
5,Fun!,"This book is loads of fun, and actually has some good advice in it. i was very pleased by the way it is layed out and how easy to read it is. i'm a bit of a geek and so is the rest of my family, so we had a lot of giggles while thumbing through it. Really like this book a lot and may have to order a new once since my toddler seems to have lost this copy XD"
1,This Book Does Not Exist!,"Judith McNaught never wrote this book. It's a shame that almost 2 years after this was announced by her publisher, amazon.com continues to add to the reader's confusion by listing this as an available book.Ms. McNaught took the initial plot device of a car accident and used it as the beginning of her latest book - Someone to Watch Over Me. She has no immediate plans for a time travel novel."
4,Water's Edge,I was looking for the book by this title by Judith McNaught. And accidentally bought this book. It was a good story and I wouldn't mind reading more by this author if you can find her books.
2,"Gruesome, fast-paced, a satysisfying thriller...SCARY!","Do you like scary books that don't give you nightmares? This book has a nightmarish quality to it, but NO BAD DREAMS! The illustrations are gory and gruesome, as well as the book. A nice, bloody, horror story for night-but don't go out of your way to find it. And if you liked BLOOD WOLF, there are a series of other SHOCKERS books for you to devour...If you dare.."
2,Disjointed Annoying,"I remember buying this LP as a young man, my first ""Forze"". I'd known the opera as a boy and loved it. However, when I put this version on the turntable, I thought I'd bought the wrong work. I never listened to this annoyingly disjointed rendering again.A few weeks later, I bought the strikingly brilliant Price, Tucker, Merrill ""Forze"" with Shippers conducting (1965?) and have never had need of any other. That's the version to get. That, and the Callas version."
1,Tales of old Florida,Terrible book ! I thought it would be settler stories but instead it was made up stories of Yankees visiting and telling how we do everything wrong. Well they should of stayed up north.
5,Tales of Old Florida,Great Book so far! Look forward to finishing it. Have not finished reading it. Both my husband and I enmjoy this type of books.
5,Living History of Florida,"The stories in this book give you a first hand historic background of Florida's history. Also, it is very entertaining, and good variety."
3,Scuzzying upwards,"Refined towards the point of hard hitting believability, the sophomore still proved lacking the necessary ingredients to take the band further."
1,Unfortunately a letdown...,"First off, anyone who fell for that whole ""censored cover/protest"" hoax is an unforgivable SIMP. That said, I'm sorry to say the musical content of this album falls far short of expectations set by the OXES' surprisingly good debut album. They seem to have unlearned the dynamics of uniquely coordinated riffs and time signature trickery that were in abundance on that disc. Oh well. I will know better for next time, but my advice for those gathering curiosity about this band would be to immerse yourself in their only (so far) worthwhile venture, the self-titled first CD."
4,made a great gift for my girlfriend,"I showed her this movie a month ago and she really liked the soundtrack, its not what she usually listens to so I was happy to get her something new and classy. Shes been enjoying it on her drive to and from work and Im happy that she wants to listen to non-top 40 stuff that actually has meaning and class."
5,A perfect compliment to the perfect movie.,"I love Fiona's ""across the universe"" cover. It was quite 'pleasant'..."
2,Disappointed in Connecticut,"After listening to Spirit Trail one time, I was a little dissapointed with the content. I thought maybe if i listened to it a couple more times I would catch on. After all I have all BH's CD's and have seen him in concert a couple of times. He has always been one of my favorites. However, I think he missed the boat on this one."
5,HORNSBY DOUBLE CD WORTH THE WAIT,"Bruce Hornsby delights on this new double disc release from RCA. This masterpiece, well worth the wait, will satisfy old fans and attract new ones. Though I personally felt that the second disc boasted a stronger content than the first, Bruce does not disappoint as he explores a more stripped-down piano sound. Hornsby continues to amaze me with every new recording. Overall, a wonderful addition to any fan's collection."
5,Spirit Trail is simply incredible.,"If you like Bruce Hornsby, OR piano music, OR thought-provoking lyrics, OR catchy tunes, OR just incredibly great music, you will love Spirit Trail. If you like all of these things, you are in for a real treat!"
5,Long time fan,I fell in love with his music back in 1986. With every CD Bruce puts out I feel he has grown. This 2 CD set is so powerful! What I love about Bruce is that he always does what he wants musicaly. He does not listen to the critics who have torn him apart since 1986! He always strives to make the best record he can at that point in his career. He does not rush out an album every year or so just to have something out. He works his craft and then lets the rest of the world in on it. You are great Bruce!!
1,VERY DISIPOINTING BOOK,"I recently purchased a boat with twin ""96"" model 225 SW Yamaha's. I typically do all of my own maintenance and was looking for a manual that basically covered my new engines. The title indicated that it covers all motors from 1992 threw 1998. I was concerned with this broad range but thought that it would have a few good pieces of info that could be useful. I was very wrong in that assumption. The illustrations are of very old motors and the wiring diagrams are so small that the print cannot be read with a magnifying glass. In the entire manual there is not even a mention of my 225 hp motors. Buyer be ware of this very poor publication. Clymer has outdone them self with this very poor book"
1,Substandard book,"I own a 1998 70hp Yamaha. My maintenance, just like most outboard maintenance, is with the carburetors. I have worked extensively with other factory and after market manuals. I was very disappointed with this manual. The carburetors for this motor were not documented. The pictures in the manual are poor (very dark). I found the Clymer manual (also available thru Amazon) to be much better."
5,This is truly the best collection of Selena's greatest songs,"Selena is the best Tejano singer I have ever heard. She had a great personality,sense of style and of course amazing voice. I believe that her death was a great loss to the whole world. Her new 10th anniversary cd ""Todos Mis Exitos"" has many of her best songs including: ""El Chico Del Apartemento 512"",""Bidi Bidi Bom Bom"",""No Debes Jugar"" and ""Dreaming of You"". We Love You Selena!! Rock the heavens like you Rocked the earth! Siempre en mi corazon! Por Vida!"
5,Selena's Comeback,"This cd comes with a rose pin with Selena's name on it, and you know it has to be a great cd if it's all her hits! The following songs are said to be on it.. 01. Amor Prohibido 02. Tu Solo Tu 03. Como La Flor 04. I Could Fall In Love 05. El Chico Del Apartamento 512 06. Que Creias 07. Baila Esta Cumbia 08. Dreaming Of You 09. Bidi Bidi Bom Bom 10. La Llamada 11. No Me Queda Mas 12. I'm Getting Used To You 13. La Carcacha 14. Disco Medley 15. No Debes Jugar 16. Missing My Baby We love you Selena and miss! Ido Pero No Olvidado :O)Tatiana"
5,Selena`s greatests hits come to life,"This was definatly worth it. All the songs on here are really good. This would be a good CD to get someone who doesn`t know about Selena, but you think they would like her music. I can`t wait for Volume 2!"
4,"GREAT CD, BUT......","I LOVE THIS CD AND I AM GLAD I BOUGHT , IT'S JUST THAT SOME OF SELENA'S HITS WERE NOT ON IT.FOR EXAMPLE , VEN CONMIGO WAS NOT ON IT AND THAT WAS HER FIRST #1 BILLBOARD HIT!"
2,Book vs Cassette,"I was impressed with the CD. It is excellent both the story and the music. I was disappointed in the book, however, It is to simplistic for even a four year old. It does not contain any of the Swahili terms for the principles and the drawings are simple outlines. I wish the story on the CD had been shared in tbe book.CD - 5 starsBook - 1 star"
1,Of course...,"...crap is always high proirity. There are about 10 movies with the same title. At least two are worthy of viewing (the french one (1931) with Erich von Stroheim I keep waiting for, and the english one (1942) with James Mason which is not too bad), but the TV crap was the only choice for release, and worse, it is even going to be re-released. Crap-lovers will be delighted, but are they the only customers who need to be served?????? Konrad Lorenz was sure right when he said (about half a century ago : ""The missing link between ape and man, it's us""; what would he say now?"
3,Interesting,"The book provides an interesting discussion concerning all aspects of suicide. Of course outdated, however a lot of the information still applies. Worth reading if your interested in the subject."
1,not worth it,really not worth the money. although it is not expensive. It really just was not helpful to me. The company did ship it quickly and it was exactly as they promised.
3,"Good watching, but NO SAUSAGES!","This is an entertaining little video, but based on reviews I read for it, I expected to see the skit with the suasages. But alas, I was disappointed. No sausages here."
4,A Dip in Form Versus Season 3,"Most KITH fans agree that there seemed to be a swoon in Season 4 driven by a lack of creative spark. I would have to concur. While the troupe have rounded out their performances by this season, the material itself drops off. Still there are high points and I think the idea was that they were hoping to be more daring as shown but their lack of reliance on the old standby characters. Many of the recurring sketches are new, such as the socially edgy ""Steps"" featuring a group of gay men hanging out on the steps shooting the breeze.The format is well-established by now: 4 discs; 3 of epsiodes; 1 of ""Best Of"", commentary, rare performances and everything else to which we've grown accustomed.Personally I think it's worth owning. If you have the other 3 sets then why not just keep completing the collection?"
3,Season four slumber,"I love Kids in the Hall and had seasons 1-3 for a long time. I wanted to complete the series, so I bought the last two season. While watching the last two seasons, I noticed the show got boring. I didnt laugh as much in season four and I was very disappointed by it. Im happy to see that other reviewers fell the same way about it. Still a few laughs, but not as good as earlier seasons."
2,funny; but a poor value,"The other reviews are correct; the Kids in the Hall are great (and are quite relevant to Sausage lovers). This video, however, contains only two episodes and as such, is of questionable value."
3,"Funny, but the earlier seasons were better","There are a few classics in this DVD series, but they pretty much can be seen in the ""best of"" disc. The remaining skits...eh...well...how does one say this...but it seemed like they were running out of steam in this season. WAAAAY too many skits are forgettable or (ack) just overall not very funny. & I could not bear to sit through an entire episode devoted to the Queen of England. Even 3 stars seems pretty generous.I love Kids in the Hall, but unless you're a diehard fan, I would recommend skipping this season."
4,Kids in the hall in their prime,"I love the kids in the hall. The first season I wasn't totally into, I think they hadn't found their groove yet. But in the laters seasons their awesome. Never the less, it's still worth buying. Bought used and you'd never know by the condition. No scratches, perfect condition."
5,The BEST kids CD!,We also checked out this CD from the library and had to buy our own copy after renewing it serveral times. It is great and I sometimes think I like it more than my son does. I've even listened to it when he isn't in the car with me. It's fun without being annoying and we love to sing along with the BKB. It is worth every penny!
5,"If you hate Barney, you'll love this!",I really dug it and so did my kids. (So did my mother)It's fun and smart and cool.Talked to a friend who's a grandad and he listens to it even without the grandkids. It's that good.
4,sweet cd,I work with young children and enjoy cd's that are not the same songs we've all heard many times. This was a great addition to our cd collection.
3,Good album,"I first heard Unearthly Trance on a Relapse sampler disc. I didn't really know what to expect, but I figured I would like it, as I dig most Relapse bands. I liked what I heard so I decided to get ""The Trident."" I am not disappointed that I bought this album. My initial impression was a mixture of Neurosis, Melvins, and Bathory, three bands that I really dig. One of my favorite tracks is the first one, ""Permanent Ice."" I think the third riff and the following guitar solo have a very Bathory-esque feel. This album is pretty good overall. If you like Neurosis, High on Fire, Melvins, or even Mastodon, you would probably like this."
5,Finally On DVD,One of Alice's greatest performances. This was his comeback tour in 86 and it was loaded with theatrics. (look for Kip Winger on Bass) It's great that this unbelivable performance is finally on DVD
4,"It Returns, Indeed","While not as polished in look or sound as Brutally Live, this is classic Alice at its best. All the theatrical elements are here, and it's nice to see Alice going ""back to his roots"" in terms of his music and stage show. After a long and winding road in the early 80's, it's nice to see ""The Nightmare Returns."""
4,80's alice at his best!,"Having seen this tour ,this is a very good representation of the show. Alice had to come back and show all the Alice wannabes such as WASP, Motley Crue, Fatal Attraction and almost any band out of Hollywod in the 80's how it's REALLY done! This concert of course has the classics plus some of the heavier music Alice strated to put out during this time. It's interesting to see kip winger on bass before all the damage he did to 80's metal. And of course steriod filled Kane Roberts who is an underrated guitarist."
3,Older Concert Just Doesn't Make It,"This concert is a bit old and hard to visualize after watching his Brutal Planet DVD concert just last year. The first few songs almost make Alice appear as though he can't sing a note. Once the concert gets going, it's okay, but nothing worth really entertaining. His band wasn't much during this tour and only the classics really make this video worth purchasing. If you want a better concert - purchase the Brutal Planet DVD - that's entertainment!"
1,"Do not buy this download game, at less you have a 80s or 90s computer","I spent 5 hours trying to activate this game. it was a waste of time and money. I guess it will work well with an old computer of 80s. Three diferent people tried to run this this game on two diferent computers, and it was imposible."
1,This game stinks,I can't believe they could make this game. I have more then the requirements. I spent [money] on the game and it won't work! I did everything that the one ... guy who said it was the users fault to do. Nothing worked. I think that guy is [mistaken]. All the game does is freeze my computer and I have to reboot it. This game ... has way too many bugs. We have downloaded every patch off the website and none of them have worked. If I were you I wouldn't buy this game
1,B-17 flying rubbish.,"First I get a game with disk2 missing ""Pacific Fighters""now I downloaded this rubbish of a game.Amazon needs beta testers to check some of these games out.B-17 flying fortress is a real Dog, amazon has lost it`s credibility with me.This game is lousy."
5,the mighty 8th needs a mighty machine : (,"Ive been waiting on this game over a year since its recent release the message boards have been lighting up with warnings about how much machine you will need to run this game .theyre saying a min of 256k ram and a big video card people with the big machines are saying this game is the very best with the exception of a few small bugs that should be patched soon .people with the small machines are crying about how slow the game runs and that the screen will lock up.let me know if its worth the upgrade to buy this game , until then ill be building rollercoasters ."
3,Problems with the Windows XP Professional,I bought this game a few months ago. I didn't have any problems loading and playing it with the Windows NT platform. I was very dissapointed that I wasn't able to play with the XP. Any suggestions?luis.gomez@us.army.mil
1,WOW,"This game was by far the very worst game that i have ever seen. it was unbelieveable how stupid it looked. graphics were horrible, it was boring, all of the enemy planes and attack tactics were the same, and i cant stand how slow it ran, even though my computer is fully loaded with speed, graphics cards, sound cards, and lots of ram, memory, and free space. HORRIBLE dont WASTE you MONEY"
1,DONT BUY IT!,Is as simple as this it DOESN'T WORK. Don't waste your money the game doesn't crash but it could take around 30 miutes just to start flying. and don't said to me that I dont know how to fly I'm an C-130 pilot.
4,Take the time and learn carefully...you will enjoy!,"Ok, i have read all 36 reviews..yes, i agree you need a powerful machine with good graphics but to say the game is difficult to play or use is going a little too far. Look, read the manual and do some practice flying and bombing. It did take a little time to figure out how to play at a usuable level, but i had no trouble taking off, flying, bombing, defending from gunner to gunner, and finally landing. Take time to learn the ""ropes"" of this game. You will enjoy it and have fun moving from mission to mission. Bombs away. Oh yea, why would a C-130 pilot rate this game?"
1,Forget it,"My computer exceeds the requirements listed on the package (PII with 500 MHZ, 128 RAM), however the system crashes each time I launch it. Trying to contact customer support in a manner is litterally impossible. Frustration is high with this product and this company. They sell something that they misrepresented (i.e. system requirements) and provide substandard support to assist you. DO NOT PURCHASE!"
2,just okay,"I have most of the major flight sims and now I have this and have only worked with it a bit but I find it a little too overcomplicated, it's taxing even for someone who is a flight simmer and is already flight tested and combat tested.The graphics are good but first there was the necessity to download a patch which at 25mb is the largest game patch I've ever seen, the list of fixes is enough to make you question why they released it in that form anyway.Although the amount of interactivity is less with the bombers in Janes Attack Squadron so is the level of overhead.If you are really a B17 nut though and you want total realistic immersion in that plane then you'll like the sim."
3,Repetative,"Same thing over and over. I played the OLD Microprose B-17 on my 486 20MHz computer, and other than a graphics improvement, this is not any real improvement. If anything, because the older game had to rely on good gameplay as opposed to eye-candy, the older game may be better in that respect. You take off, you gather in a group, you go to the target, taking gunner spots on the way there, you get on IP, you take the bombier spot, you drop, and you fly back home. Over and over again. It's fun for a while, but not for long. Even the fighters are not that much fun to fly, as it is the same thing as other WW2 fight sims. No improvemetns, no innovative items. Pretty much, this has all been done before, and done as well or better.3 stars. It's as average as it gets."
1,Too much machine needed for too little game,I waited 6 months for this game. Rushed home and started the long road of upgrades. DO YOUR SELF A FAVOUR .. DON'T BUY THIS GAME. Yes I had the min requirements ATI 128 16mb video card. 128 mb of ram and a celeron II 600. It ran < 15 frames per second @ 800x 600 x 32 (16 bit color is way too ugly)Upgraded to 256 mb of ram NO change in frame rate.Install new Maxtor Diamond ultra 100 harddrive with fresh install of win 98se NO change in frame rate.Swap ISA sound blaster 16 for SB live to help the CPU No rate change but sounds greatOverclocked cpu to 750 hz Only 2 fps rate increase.Overclocked the video card to over 107 hz (from 90) about 4 fps frame rate increaseMoral of story you need at least 32 mb video card to get over 20 fps playablity. These upgrade are beyond the average computer user and I'm not going to speed another $300 on a video card for this mediocre game.
5,Gear Up!,"If you loved Microsoft Combat Flight simulator, you'll love B-17. It does require a lot of power so be prepared for crashes if you have weak system."
1,You can't live in past and other tales of modern computing,"I remember seeing this game years and years ago and I always wanted to pick it up. Killing some time on Amazon the other night I saw that this was available for less than $4! I thought this would be a great deal. I was wrong. What were game designers thinking back then? Poor interface, unnecessarily difficult to navigate, confusing game play, etc.I guess I'm spoiled with modern games and graphics. If I had play this as a child and loved it I may have been more nostalgic about it. I didn't and I'm not.Oh well, I would have probably bought a cup of coffee or two with the money I wasted here....didn't need the caffeine anyways.Don't waste your money. Do Not Buy"
2,Ouch,Barber is painfully boring and his views are over the top liberal. Read it for school and would not wish reading this on my worst enemy.
5,All-Glass Aquarium Fluorescent 20 Single Tube Black Strip Light,"Product was as described, packaged well, shipped, and arrived promptly. Very pleased. I wanted a wood grain decor, but this serves the purpose well.All-Glass Aquarium Fluorescent 20 Single Tube Black Strip Light"
5,Drill bits,"Buyers should know that they will not directly fit in a standard dremel bit collet; you will need either a 1/32 collet or I recommend keyless chuck adapter as a very handy accessory. Used for drilling circuit board prototypes - meaning thin copper and 1/8"" fiberglass laminate and many holes. Bits held up extremely well... much better than those I obtained from a local hardware store ... and cut very quickly and easily."
5,Dremel 1/32 drill bit,"I used this bit today, to drill out the string holes in the ukelele that I am finishing building. The ability to drill very small holes, with precision, is just what was needed. I love that the Dremel has several options when it comes to filling the need for small holes, and other jobs that would be difficult without the tool. I wonder how I ever got along without it."
1,IN ONE WORD: BORING.,"BEING A DEVOTED FAN OF BELLINI OPERAS, I EXPECTED SOME FIREWORKS FROM THIS PIECE. WHAT I GOT WAS A WET RAG, IN SPITE OF VERY RELIABLE SOLOISTS. THE PROBLEM LIES WITH THE MUSIC ITSELF, WHICH NEVER TAKES FLIGHT, NEVER ACHIEVES THE REALM OF THE BEAUTIFUL. IN OTHER WORDS, IT DOES NOT MAKE YOU SIT UP AND LISTEN. RECOMMENDED ONLY FOR THOSE WITH PLENTY OF TOLERANCE."
2,"Sound is great, Video is awful","I was delighted to find an opera DVD in widescreen and with Surround Sound. Had modern DVD standards finally get to opera DVDs?Alas, the video on this is very overcompressed, even for two disks. Visual artifacts make this barely watchable on a large HD screen with a progressive scan player. But, with both DTS and Dolby, it is a delight to listen to."
2,Better Heard than Seen,"This is a wonderfully sung and performed COSI FAN TUTTE. The problem is the video quality it terrible. On your HDTV it is like watching the opera from behind an annoying screen. The picture is blurry and anything but crisp. Details are lost, and the better your TV, the more annoying this is. My recommendation is to skip the dvd and get the cd of this performance."
5,An absolute delight!,"Loved every minute of this performance! I will only add that the voices were all stellar - incredible range required for Mozart - and the blending of Manion's (Dorabella) and Roocroft's (Fiordiligi) sopranos skilled and delightful. I was fascinated with Dorabella and Fiordiligi: difficult to distinguish in the beginning and gradually allowing their different natures to emerge along with differences in costuming. This production, like all of Gardiner's, is excellent; anyone wanting scan and pan with lots of closeups is missing a genuine treat!"
3,Time Capsule,"A portrait of Hong Kong, Cambodia, Thailand, Burma, India, Sikkim, Mongolia, Siberia and Japan from the perspective of NY Times reporter's wife in 1966."
4,USB Portable Speakers,Good quality for a small portable speaker. Convenience because it works through the USB port. I wished that they could make the volumn a little bit louder.
3,"If It Weren't for Lou Reed, This Would have Been Perfect","I love the American Masters series. I have a lot of them taped from TV. In my opinion, this boxed set of American Masters would have been perfect had they put somebody besides Lou Reed in the mix. After all, we're showcasing some of the finest African-American musicians here! There were American Masters programs done on Duke Ellington, Ray Charles, even Jessye Norman. It's as if PBS put together two shows people are going to want and added one that they couldn't get rid of otherwise. I took two stars away for that. I have both the Quincy Jones and the Ella Fitzgerald series on tape. I won't be upgrading to DVD just to get Lou Reed. In this case, it's best to buy separately, and buy used to save money."
2,Fantastic Performances Ruined By Abyssmal Sound Engineering,"The performances here are all first rate - I agree with what has been noted before. The sound engineers must have been on crack though, because many passages are recorded at a too high volume level and distort, or ""crackle"" through the speakers. This is a MAJOR problem, not a slight one. The problem is with the original master tapes, not the CD remastering. And no, you can not adjust your treble, bass or volume to fix this, as one reviewer suggested. It was recorded with major distortion, period. There is absolutely no excuse for a major label studio recording to have such amateurish sound engineering. How could the producer not have caught this on playback? What a waste of vocal talent!"
3,Great performance.........Disasterous remastering!,"How awful of RCA to remaster this so horribly!!As the music and voices get louder, the recording crumbles and crackles, almost like in an early live recording. Such a shame when the performance is so white hot! My only complaint is that Price sings a very clunky and unmusical cadenza at the end of D'Amor Sull'ali Rosee, marring a beautifully sung aria."
5,unknown but great,"Not very famous that band, but what a band! This album has been ""made in the shade"" of The Allman's, and the level is as big as the Original...Try it! you won't be disappointed. Believe me..."
2,Avery Matte White Postcards - Not,"I would have rated this high except for one major issue. It is not what it says it is. The item is advertised as POSTCARDS and heavyweight. That is what I expected. However, the paper is thin and bends easily, unlike ""postcard"" material. I found it flimsy for mailing. The material is more like those magazine insert mailing forms; thin, bendable, easily rips, etc. It has a nice texture, might be good for artwork, receipe cards, cut well, prints nice, and states that it meets US Postal Regs. However, not at all what I wanted."
2,"Looks nice, but don't mail it!","I bought these to make RSVPs for my wedding. I got lucky and before I mailed all of them with the invites I got my sister's RSVP in the mail. From running through the mail machinces, half of the toner had come off! I hade to buy ""invisible"" scotch tape and put it over our address on the remaining RSVPs (rather than buying a different product and spend the time redoing them) so I was sure I would get them back. Trying to read the RSVPs was a little difficult too.In short: they print nice, but as for being a ""postcard"" product, these really aren't meant to go through the mail because the ink does not set in the paper."
3,Ok for the money but light bulb sucks.,"The light is not a full spectrum light, it made everything in the tank look greenish. For the price is ok but most likely you will have to get a better bulb if you want to show off your fish or plants."
5,Where have I been?,"I heard Zeca on last.fm and as much as I liked his music, I quickly and mistakenly labeled him as of those ""one time hits"". How wrong I was, actually, it's exactly the opposite: this dude is a ""beautiful melody"" generator. I really love his music and his style: beautiful melodies and exceedingly rich ""drum works"". It's like a fusion between classical music, samba and everything in between.He reminds me of Marco Antonio Solis, with Marco having the edge in terms of voice while Zeca's music is far richer and more interesting.I am labeling him my 2010 best surprise; he is joining my favorite Brazilian collection alongside Marisa Monte, Maria Bethania, Jorge Ben, Gilberto Gil, Caetano Veloso and Milton Nascimento."
2,Do Not Buy This,"This is not a very good co-op game. The lighting is horrible, the graphics are so bad you can walk through people, and you cannot get passed the 2nd level."
4,Andre Rieu,"I am a big fan of Andre Rieu but didnot enjoy this as much as several of his earlier recordings. It didn't have quite the zip as ""Andre Rieu Live"" or ""The Holland I Love""."
1,AWFUL !!!!!,"What a waste, too bad I can't give 0 stars.Extremely slow and boring, but I kept waiting for something to happen (shame on me).Then they played this horrible music - and increased the volume when they did it - during some slow-motion scenes at several points during the movie. I used the mute button to get past it and could have used the fast forward, nothing was missed.Thankfully it's less than 90 minutes (don't remember the exact length) I was just so very happy it was over, but still dismayed that I had wasted time on this movie."
1,awful,The best thing about this movie was that it was really short. The music was so loud and annoying we fast forwarded through it.
1,Waste of time,"What is the point of a murder mystery when you figure out who the killer is in the first 5 minutes? The killer ends up being the only person in the town who smokes, spits and swears. He's only character in the town that is at all suspicious. If you're considering buying, renting or even *gasp* downloading this movie, don't. You're better off watching a law & order re-run on tnt."
2,LAND of the self- righteous.... BLAND!!!,"At the beginning this film showed promise..Good acting and cinematograpy.....but then it switched into the ""club you over the head...'born again'self rightousness mode"" and became rather unsoulfull and dull. There's nothing wrong with somebody changing negative,hurtful behavior in themselves but this, ultimately, felt false and preachy."
4,Wonderful Stuff,"As a long time fan, I have sometimes been disappointed by the lack of consistent song quality on most of their releases. To me Never Loved Elvis was probably their most consistent effort. This CD is a pleasant surprise. We see a return of some of the Celtic elements that were present at various times in their career. The songwriting reflects Miles Hunt at his sarcastic best. The song Angelica Maybe is catchy as hell and may be among my favorite Stuffy tunes. If you liked the Wonder Stuff before you will love this release. My only negative is that, in typical pop formula, a chorus can be repeated a few too many times, but hey that's rock n roll."
5,"The best album ""Miles Hunt"" never released","See my review for Miles Hunt's amazing ""Not an Exit"" for a dozen reasons why this album is so great. Since most of the original Stuffies have departed (or tragically dearly departed), I struggle if this should even be called a Wonder Stuff release. Nice to have Malc Treece back in the fold, along with powerhouses Andres Krau (drums) and Erica Nockalls (violin). That said, Wonder Stuff 2.0 is utterly amazing. Most every song on here is a stunner, impeccably produced, passionately delivered power pop. This is the soundtrack to being alive and living each moment to the fullest. So names be damned. This album (and Not an Exit) marks the beginning of a new band, a new era and new reasons for old Wonder Stuff fans to celebrate."
1,What is with the eyes!,"I have been a Kiss fan for 25 years,so when I heard about this book I was excited.When I got it I was horrified to find all the photo's had been altered from there original prints.For some unknowen reason they decided to add ink to all of Gene Simmons eyes(blacking out his pupils)It ruined a book that very well could have been the best Kiss photo book to date."
3,Could have been better.,"I found the book, not as good as I had expected. there was not much that I hadn't seen before. A lot of this has really been seen before in most fan magazines since the reunion. The write ups have a little bit to do with the picture that they share the page with, but not much. I don't hate the book, but I thought there would be more comments specific to the pictures, and maybe some more (unseen) candid shots from their personal collections. The clarity of the pictures is good, at least hey didn't use the hazy effect on the last calendars."
2,Just pictures...,"I am a huge KISS fan, especially up until Dynasty era.. Anway, this is pictures that are average at best. If I could do things over, I wouldnt have bought it. Just my opinion"
4,Good historical book...from Gene and Paul's view,"If you buy this book be prepared to get more of Paul and Gene's bashing Ace and Peter, more self-indulgence and lots of Gene's ""we are the greatest band in the world"" and Paul's ""Women love my hairy chest"" and all that stuff. On the good side, the pictures presented here are amazing. From a walk on Central Park in full makeup! circa. 1975, to a session of facials the band got in a beauty parlor, the rare pics are worth the price of the book alone. You will read this book in an hour and certainly will enjoy the dozens of pictures Waring Abbott shot from 1974 to 1981. I would have liked for the leaders of the band and writers of the book to comment more on each individual photo and also invite Ace and Peter to give their two cents on the shots. Anyway, a good book on Kiss at a not so high price. Great for any fan of the band."
5,The Classic KISS,"A fantastic book for any KISS fan. The beauty of KISS is they have always been not only a great band to listen to, but even more so, a great band to look at. This book captures the band on their rise to super stardom and includes pictures from the Elder era when the band were rock Icons on their way down. True KISS fans like myself are always on the hunt for new sights and sounds of the band, and this book delivers many new unpublished photos that everyone will enjoy. From pictures of the band applying makeup, to the infamous Cadillac, Michigan high school event. Fantastic color and black and white photos abound, guaranteed to satisfy all KISS fans. A must have."
4,"Not a lot of reading, but good for the diehard Kiss fan","This book is photographs from 1974-1982 with some comments provided by Gene and Paul. Not a lot of content, but a cool quick read for the Kiss Army members."
2,Ernie Ball,These strings don't stay bright. If you like less pesence in your sound these will be good for you. Aloha.
4,Sterling Ball is caca kooie,"I met this guy at NAMM a few times and each time he gets a little more looney. Personally I don't care for men who dress up in costume for social events but if you like that sort of thing, then Sterling Ball is your guy and these strings are what you're looking for.The strings are bass strings so if you're a bassist like me, you either like what you like or like what someone told you. I like them so you will like them. Sterling is a very strange man with a penchant for womans clothing. He probably likes monkeys too."
4,Good Strings!,"Works on my 3/4 bass well, giving it a full bass sound. REally lets you hit those low bass bombs."
2,Well produced but lacks real detail,More an advert for the Russell Crowe movie than an insight into the historical Robin Hood. Good production values make it watchable but as a bona fide doco it is a bit lacking.
3,Victorian-era horror,"I did enjoy these stories, but wanted to warn the potential reader that they may find them highly dated. His ideas are based on the psychoanalysis of the time, relying heavily on Roscrucians, 19th century spiritual faddishness, and the like (a la Crowley or Dion Fortune.) Although well written, with a great sense of scene, our more jaded King era readers or anyone up on modern Magick will find these mild and the ideas just plain passe.Note, of course, we still read the classics regardless of era, but Lovecraft's work is far more durable."
4,black wood,"this collection contains many of his finest. wndigo, willows, glamor of the snow.... Blackwood is great at creating the setting, no the greatest. and in describing the conflict between ancient and modern. also he is great at describing the lure of the dark. some of the stories are nor so great, like max hensig. which is why it's four stars"
5,This book will mess with you,"Wow the stories in this book are all time classics. Algernon Blackwood was obviously well traveled. He definetley had a strange/odd perspective of Life,that would never come to mind for me, and he is able to put that to paper. The stories will haunt you well after you put it down!"
4,Good campfire tales,"These short stories are not exactly ghost stories (well some are) but good creepy tales that are great to read. They are not the general genre of horror, there's no full scale slaughter or people dangling anywhere but are eerie stories full of suspense. Some are a bit wordy, not as in diction, but as in over explaining the scene. This helps build the suspense most of the time, but in a few of the stories it slows things down a little too much. Blackwood has a great style for setting vivid backgrounds and characters that make his stories just so readableand and likable, that I think most people will like it."
5,Pulls You Right In...,"Each story starts slowly but by ten pages in, you will be hooked each time. The Willows is a masterpiece, and the Wendigo is great also. SUSPENSE is the key here. Blackwood was a true artist. Each sentence is perfection- there is no filler! If you are impatient, this book may not be for you. Otherwise, read and enjoy!"
4,A beautiful Portuguese journey,"Portuguese-speaking Lusophone culture is best known globally through the music of Brazil, although this collection traces its lesser-known African crosscurrents, with music from Angola, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, Mozambique, and contemporary Portugal. Featured artists include Ze Manel, Jovino Dos Santos, Dulce Pontes, the Mendes Brothers, and Paulo Flores, whose individual albums can also be tracked down if you are diligent. The opening tracks are a bit florid for my tastes, but the simpler acoustic numbers, by folks like Ruy Mingas, Maneas Costa and Agusto Cegos, are quite lovely. A good introductory overview, although there are other albums, such as the SOUL OF CAPE VERDE collection that may move you more. But this disc may be of special interest for anyone seeking artists a bit off the beaten track."
5,Eight Stars!,"I won't be the first person to rate a CD by how many cuts are worthy of being included on a home-made ""best of"" compilation, but it seems a reasonable measure to use. Of the 12 cuts, I find an impressive 8 to be exceptionally good (and already on my comp CDs), and 3 to be only very good! This is not only very accessible and enjoyable music, it's very good music. Perhaps Putumayo's best, and that's saying something. If you like it, I'd also recommend Putumayo's Cape Verde and, different but worth a try, French Caribbean."
3,good...... price!,"This is not the best book about newts and salamanders, butit is very very ok if you look to the price up there!!Lot of nice images, ideas and some diseases info. I liked."
4,Good $ value,"This amp is a good buy for money & for the power. You can trust the power rating. I have used it to drive a Lanzar Max12D (12"" dual 4 ohm voice coil), subwoofer. And also installed another to drive 2 10"" Dayton Quatro (single 4 ohm voice coil) subwoofers from Parts Express (Amazon Seller of whom I am a wholesale buyer) and it drove both configurations just fine with no over over heating problems."
4,More documentary than concert,What can you say it's the Flaming Lips and if you like the lips than you'll like this DVD. It did feel a bit more like a documentary because of all the interviews in between the songs. Would have been a 5star rating if they offered a concert only mode. The video was taken by a mix of pro and consumer grade camcorders and the audio is superb 5.1 surround. For the price of entry (at the time 8.99+shipping) I'd order it again in a heart beat.
4,Wayne Coyne,"Many of you have said that Wayne Coyne is very humble. I agree 100 fold. I live in Oklahoma City and this guy can be seen anywhere from public charity appearances to mowing his lawn with no shirt and a beer. The guy is cool. Although you may not be the biggest fan of space/psychedelic rock, you will still enjoy this dvd. This is not just a concert, it is a performance. Try to imagine smashing up a Cirque du Soleil show with a Pink Floyd concert. I would put their stage performance on a must see level rivaled only by the likes of bands/artists such as Garth Brooks, Trans Siberian Orchestra, Jimmy Hendrix, Queen, and Eric Clapton. Ok, so you got me.. I have never seen Jimmy Hendrix, or Queen live... I never got the chance.. But I watched the DVDs. Don't miss your chance with The Flaming Lips. A thing- Buy this DVD. B Thing- Watch this DVD. C thing-Inevitably become a fan."
1,YUCK!!!!,"this ya ya ya ya ya ya fricken ya.. song plays every 6th song on our muzak at work and has been doing so since 2007!!!!!!!!!!!!! it's annoying enough to peel the paint off the walls and cause brain damage after a 10 hour work day...hated it the first time I heard it and hate it each of the 2,000+ times my ears have nearly bled from it........horrible tasteless annoying GARBAGE!!!!! I'd rather listen to bad 1960's country tunes BLASTING!!! I want to BARF every time I hear this miserable excuse for noise!!!! Ahhhhhhhhhhhh I feel better ;-D"
4,Very good DVD! Just a few issues....,"The Flaming Lips is a unique band, in the very best meaning of the word!Their music is diverse and innovative. Their lyrics are deep and sincere.I saw them live, and it was a fantastic experience in every way.Now, about this disc...I wish it was a 2 disc pack, with more music!Waynes vocals are good. (4 stars, remember he's not Bowie.)The concert camera coverage is good.The band is tight, and the recording is well-balanced.The mix of concert footage and behind the scenes stuff is ok...but I would have prefered them seperated. (2 discs)If you are a Flaming Lips fan...none of those small complaints should stop you from getting your own copy!I can't wait to hear / see what they do next."
1,Pointless,This material is available legally and free of copyright or charge at Gutenberg and other online ebook sevices in formats compatible with most ebook readers/PDAs. Why enrich someone when the jewels of the worlds literature are available free of charge?
3,Federico Lawrence,The music is good but the sound is not of audiophile quality. This vinyl LP does not appears to have been produced from the original analog master tape.
1,"Los Angeles, Then and Not Really Los Angeles","Perfect as a gift for those whose coffee table is Hollywood challenged. Apparently, the author/editors believe Los Angeles is 9 parts Hollywood, 1 part unimportant. Also, this book is for the advanced Hollywood student who already knows where most of these vital cultural icons exists - addresses are infrequently provided - or doesn't really care. Original camera positions for the ""then"" pictures are not duplicated in the modern version, and worse, the year in which the historic photograph is taken is not uniformly provided. Film star names are essential to the sparse narrative, as opposed to information as to the significance or relevance to Los Angeles/rest of planet of the site/photo chosen."
2,Too many then and now photos basically the same,"Of the 69 Then and Now photos, 30 were basically the same becausethe view had not changed over the years. I lived in LA for over 30 years and there are so many areas that have changed completely it's a shame that they weren't used."
3,L.A. Then and Now,"Was a little disappointed by the ""then and now"" comparison of photos, many of which were not taken from the same place or with the same perspective as their older counterparts. Have seen other such books where there was a more faithful and painstaking effort to duplicate the exact locations."
4,L.A. old and new,"could be better, but i liked itlooked thorough it several times over the years, can't be beat for the price of a movie ticketif you read it with other books about the city you will enjoy it even more"
5,AWESOME!!!! Make sure you get it!,"Far from your average female artist, KRYStAL is a whole new kind of music with her own style and her own lyrics. She breaks the mold of the female industry by far and is absolutely running away with it! Her album is filled with heart felt and inspiring lyrics that make you wanna play it all day long! Her album is definetly for ANYONE who needs a beautiful, inspiring CD from a equally beautiful! This is a definete MUST HAVE! Ask for it for Christmas or give it for Christmas! Just an awesome CD over all... Anyone will love it!"
5,Must have!!,"Woah. This CD is incredible. When I first listened to the whole cd, about every 10 seconds i would say ""Wow."" My favorite song would have to be ""Love is a Beautiful Thing"" it's just amazing. I've never been a backstreet boy fan.. but they are on the song ""Your the Reason"" and it was really good. I have a whole new respect for the backstreet boys now, because of krystal. Anyways, this CD is really good. I recommend it to everyone!"
5,Great CD,Krystal is an excellent Cd. Just enough emotion in each song to keep you listening. 12 tracks that you will listen to and not even realize you are listening to the last track. If you are stressed put this cd in and you will mellow out... Buy it.. its worth it.
5,THE BEST,"This is not another ""dumb blond"". This is reall music. Has some R&B with some soft rock pop. The radio friendly ""Supergirl"" is one of the best song on the album. My Religion is a soft song but get up beat in the middle. Love is a beutiful song . MY FAVORITE. Overall is one of the best CD's out there."
4,This was a good CD!,"This CD isn't my favorite, but songs like : Super Girl, Lead Me, ...Or Someone Else Will,and Angel on My Shoulder, were very good in my opinion. She has a nice voice and I think it's a shame that she's not too popular!!! If you like POP, that has funk and piano mixed in, this might be the CD for you. I know it was a good one for me!"
4,Beautiful & Soulful!,"They only reason I'm not giving this cd 5 stars is cuz I think she has such a great range (sp?) of oice and she uses a lot her high voice, wich is great, but her low voice is OH! so strong I just love it!! I just think she should use it more. I heard her Live and she is just amazing. Neways, I love the CD and I think is worth buying! Peace y'all!!"
2,I don't get it!!!,"Sorry, I just don't get it, she sounds the same in every song and if she couldn't whin, she wouldn't be able to ""sing"" at all. Perhaps she will get better, I will give her that, but let's give her the time to develope her own style and mature her voice."
5,Whew!!,I first heard her on disney surfers and fell in love i just love her vocie. I'd say this for peolpe who like a GREART vocie and a great baet.
4,"Pretty Good, But needs to be more poppish","This is a pretty good CD for this newcomer, who started off by BSB signing her on to a record deal. Anyways,Supergirl and My Religion our one of my personal favorites. Supergirl is about she wantting a strong man.....I guess. So buy this terrific CD with some soft pop/ bubble gum pop."
4,It's okay,"I really only wanted like two songs on the CD but none of her songs are available on itunes. Pity, so this CD was okay."
5,VEGGIE TALES : SWEETPEA BEAUTY,VEGGIETALES IS AN EXCELLENT PICK FOR A FUN WAY TO TEACH YOUNG CHILDREN GREAT MORALS WITHOUT PREACHING. IT GETS THE MESSAGE ACCROSS NICELY AND MAKES IT FUN. WE ENJOY WATCHING THIS AS A FAMILY AND WILL KEEP COLLECTING VEGGIETALES.
5,My granddaughter loves this movie!,This is a movie you do not mind your little one watching! There is a great story line with good morals being taught.
4,So cute!,I chose 4 stars only because I wish the movies were just a little longer. For the same price i can find longer movies; however this has a great message for kids. My 6-year old daughter really enjoys watching Veggie Tales!
5,Granddaughters love it!,"My granddaughters watch this all the time in their rooms and when traveling the the car; it teaches great morals and how to empathize with others, react in positive ways, and seek help when you need it. I couldn't be happier. And they love the story."
5,Adorable,Nice to have something for my grandkids to watch that teaches good moral values and a spirit of giving. Thanks.
5,"Great product, Great price!",Delivered quickly. Packaging great. Bought as a gift. Was very pleased. Kids will enjoy it I am very sure of that
1,Not like the old Veggie Tales,"I have a collection of Veggie tales dating back to the earliest ones made. A few years ago, the producers sold rights to one of the networks. This latest one is a product of the 'after' effects of that relationship. The story line is much darker than you would normally expect from veggie tales. You really don't get the message about true beauty at all because most of the talk and action is done between the queen and the mirror who wants to 'finish' the local maiden. My almost 4 year old was scared and also the other day said, ""I don't feel pretty"" - she's never said anything like that in her life. I asked her why she was saying that and she said because of the queen in veggie tales. I promptly through the thing in the trash - don't buy this - it's just confusing and not a good wholesome presentation of true beauty. Shame on veggie tales!"
4,Another Great Veggie!,"Sweetpea Beauty had a lot of excellent points in it about the importance of looking at what's on the inside, rather than on the outside based on the 1 Samuel 16:7 verse ""The Lord does not look at the things man looks at. Man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart."" Our family especially enjoyed the Snoodlerella story.I, too, was glad to see that VeggieTales continues to produce DVDs that honor God and make Him and His design for our lives a top priority. I would definitely recommend this DVD and have added Sweepea Beauty to my Mom-Approved Family Movie list on my blog."
4,Always pleased with Veggie Tales,You just can't go wrong with Veggie Tales. They have wonderful stories with great morals. This one makes reference to many fairy tales and it's fun to try to figure them all out. Good times for kids and adults alike. My girls are 10 and 12 and still enjoy watching them.
3,"Good, not Great","I have always loved Veggie Tales and when I read the subtitle: A girl after God's own heart, I decided to check reviews. Most of the feedback was really positive, so I bought it for my little girl. She likes it. Yes, I enjoy watching this with her, but there are a few things I didn't like. One was the silly song. The silly song is hilarious, its Larry trying to sell pants, like certain channels on TV. The end made it very unpleasant. Papa Grape pulls off pants from the two guys helping Larry. For a movie that is suppose to be for young children, I find that very inappropriate. Second, Sweetpea Beauty, as pictured on the front, has a very preachy, not very good acting voice. She seemed to be trying too hard. Other than these two things, its a really fun movie for kids."
3,Plastic Casing,"FYI ==> Looks like metal casing in picture but its really just plastic. They conveniently left that out in the description. Metal casings hold up better when dropped on concrete. The hold button is also plastic (Clip is metal). I gave it 3 stars for low price and the fact that the tape is very rugged. Also, the package saying its ""Made in USA with Global Materials"" must be the new lawyer candy for foreign made."
5,Gift for father,Got this as a gift for my father and he really appreciated it. It is a great brand and an affordable price.
5,Recommended by our contractor,Glad we bought it. It feels sturdy and hope it lasts us a long time. It came recommended by our contractor.
3,"good product, bad customer service","the rower works well. i used it for about 45 minutes a day, nearly every day, for about 10 months. then, the rubber housing for the ball bearings wore out. obviously, that's to be expected after such heavy use. what i didn't expect was that i would have to wait 2 months (and counting) for replacement parts! add to that the very slow response from the manufacturer when i want an update on my replacement order, and it's all quite frustrating.overall, i recommend this rower. just be aware that customer service is not nearly as satisfactory."
2,Kind of suckie,If my feet could stay in the foot pads and stop coming out after the velcro comes loose maybe I could get a work out from this product. My shoes are 9 and 1/2 so they are not particularly small. I am heading to the hardware store right now to see if I can find poxy and some plastic to lengthen the heel bracing part of the foot pad. Wish me luck!
4,Picture of South African Victorian Culture,"Written about a South African farm. this book depicts the story of a family and how they interact throughout the book. The most striking dynamic in the book is the relationships of the women in it. It portrays female existence in a realistic light even for today. The story has a lot of character to it, and I would recommend it highly for teachers who want to teach about feminism."
5,This book an absolute must for genealogists.,"This book of Map Guide to the U.S. Federal Censuses 1790-1920 is absolutely essential when researching one's ancestors. It is possible to trace their migration across this land in the earlier years of settlement. In fact, because of the differing boundries of counties and State divisions, it is necessary to place the ancestor in the correct location in his/her day rather than as the current maps show it today. It is the difference sometimes of locating a correct ancestor by a certain name and confusing another person with the same name in a slightly different location who is not kin at all. I am 100% delighted with this book.Susanna"
4,"Map Guide to the US Federal Censuses,1790 - 1920",Very informative with great graphics. Can be of great help to anyone first working with the census forms.
5,american research / must have,I've been doing family research for 25 years and it's about time i got my own federal census map guide. How do you know where your family was in any given year w/out it? I use it every time i turn on the computer-this is so worth it.
5,Very useful Honda Motorcycle book,"This book shows how to maintain and fix you Honda motorcycle. It has clear diagrams and charts, and good photographs. It has clear text, and good advice.It won't help you read the instructions that came with your motorcycle handbook that tells you how to operate the choke and if you don't read or follow the directions like I didn't do you think the carb is messed up and you rebuild it 4 times and clean it 6 times before you read the instructions in the user manual that says how to operate the choke so the bike runs great.The book gives very helpful information."
2,I guess this is why there isn't more music like this,"See my review of Lunar Drive's other album Here at Black Mesa.This is nowhere nearly as good as Black Mesa. Altogether Here has a lot more lyrics than Black Mesa and frankly the lyrics aren't even in the same class as the music itself. They may have been trying too hard.Overall the CD seems to be a random mish with no underlying connection. Most of the music isn't even pleasant or entertaining to listen to. There are a few cool pieces but if there is an underlying theme tying this whole thing together, I missed it."
1,Did not work,"I tried to ignore the reviews on this product and bought it anyway. Overall, it seems to have so many cool features. Save your packaging because it does not work."
5,Highly recommended!!,"I am extremely pleased with this purchase. It is almost impossible to find an atomic clock radio and this one even has a CD player & nature sounds (I particularly enjoy this feature). It is easy to learn to use, it has battery backup in case of a power failure, it even projects onto the ceiling which is a fabulous feature -- this product simply has it all. You won't be disappointed. PS -- the atomic clock is terrific -- within a couple of weeks after purchase, there was a time change from Daylight Savings Time to EST. I wondered if the time on the clock would change automatically. It did. I am very pleased."
2,"Decent CD player, horrible alarm clock","I've owned this alarm clock for a few months now and need to find a replacement. The first problem I have is the LCD is WAY too bright, even on the dimmest setting. And forget about the projection, unless you're looking for a reading lamp. I turned off the projector and cover the clock with a shirt so that I can sleep. Now I've found that the ""atomic"" clock likes to reset itself in the middle of the night, waking me up an hour early OR going off at midnight. For these reasons, it's useless as an alarm clock and now it will be a nice nightlight/CD player for my son's room. On the bright side, the CD player is pretty good, for an alarm clock."
2,"Too bright at night even on low setting, projected image very sharp and clear.","I enjoy the nature sounds of this model. I replaced one by the same manufacturer that quit after many years of satisfaction. I thought this one couldn't be as bright as the other reviewers mentioned. Believe them. It is. Also the speakers are barely adequate for playing a music CD. The best feature is the projection image which is sharp and clear. The nature sounds are very pleasing. I find the sound of running water helps me fall asleep. The projected image all by itself lights up my room so the brightness of the digital display is quite intrusive. I find myself covering the clock face with a book at night because it is so bright. If Homedics had included a feature to completly turn the clock dislay off as they have the projection feature, it would go a long way towards making this model as good as it's predecessor. I don't believe I'd buy this product again."
1,Nice bright nightlight...,"This is my 4th one, the first three had various problems within 30 days of purchase. The nature sounds are rather repetitive, they are short sound loops and you can tell that it is just a recording playing over and over. CD play laser seek is noisy. Actual speaker sound is just ok, not what I would have expected from a ""Premium"" sound spa.The buttons are unlit and hard to find at nighttime. Which is funny when you realize just how much light the display puts out.The projected display is a very nice option for those of use who cannot see our clocks without glasses at night time. This is the only reason why I purchased this item.It would have been nice to have a remote control added to the package as an option.Dec 17 2009 - update. Well number 5 just died... what lousy quality control. I wonder how HoMedics can stay in business."
1,Dont Buy This,"I purchased this clock looking forward to the relaxing nature sounds and cd along with the projection clock. ALL Three of the clocks sent to me had a faulty projector. Don't take a chance, three out of three were not working and all of them were brand new. It is sad to see such a faulty product still on the market."
3,Great CD alarm clock but WAY too bright,"This is my second attempt in buying a CD alarm clock and I do not understand why the manufacturers make the LCD so bright! Even on its dimmest setting, this clock illuminates my room and makes it difficult to sleep. Additionally, the projection feature is too bright even when I've covered the LCD. I'm trying to find a creative solution because it's too much of a hassle to return.I gave this alarm clock 3 stars because the sound quality is good and I like the nature sound options. I would be entirely happy with it if it weren't for the brightness. It's a great option for a child's room or anywhere light isn't a problem."
3,"Good, if somewhat misleading","Overall a good collection of songs, both in terms of the quality of the material and the mastering.But I do have some minor complaints. First, the original intro from ""Where's the Dress"", what got me hooked on the song back in the day, was missing. What's the deal with that? Did someone from Culture Club object to it? Second, only four of the ten tracks are by the duo; the rest are comprised of three solo works from each of them. Not that there's anything wrong with the solo efforts of either Moe or Joe, but they produced enough material as a duo to put out a greatest hits CD from that material, especially if it's only ten songs. And that's my third complaint - why only ten songs, totaling less than 28 minutes?"
5,Super Hits Moe Bandy & Joe Stampley,"Once I put this in the player all I could do is sing along with them. It took me back to the time they came out with each song (I am not young); it really got me into a good mood. I have listen to it at least 3 or 4 times a week, which is a lot for me I own about 100 or more of the good older classic 'Country' by the older singers that put ""feeling"" into it. I totally enjoyed this CD and will keep on enjoying it for a long time."
4,chuck,"this is good ole country music at it's best from a couple of great singer ,songwriters.........some of these tunes will even make you smile and laugh!!!"
4,YET ANOTHER SELECTION FOR MY MOTHER. SHE ENJOYS IT!!!,"YET ANOTHER GIFT FOR MY MOTHER. SHE LOVES COUNTRY MUSIC. I LIKE SOME OF IT, ESPECIALLY THE OLDER COUNTRY. I ASKED HERE HOW SHE LIKED THE CD, AND SHE TOLD ME IT WAS GOOD."
1,A little short of 30 bags...,"Wanna know why? Cuz the box they came in was all smashed up, and even hand-taped,When I opened it, there were tea grinds everywhere, and 5 bags were less than half full.Even the tea bags themselves are poorly constructed - without strings. Two of the bagshave already opened up in the boiling water - without being in there for more than 3 minutes."
4,not too tasty,"I got this tea and read all the reviews beforehand. It said it helped detoxify the liver, so I was game to try it. Some people said to put lemon juice or honey into it because of the taste. My husband and I both put lots of lemon in it and still found the taste to be too much like drinking a tree root. I guess my liver will have to detoxify on its own, because I just can't bring myself to drink this tea!"
2,Tea tastes awful,"This tea took a week to arrive. When it did, it arrived in good shape.Sadly, my husband & I both hate the taste. It tastes like muddy dried leaves.We got this because dandelion root is meant to be good for you but these teabags tastes awful."
1,Dandelion Root Tea,"After several cups of this tea (which tasted horrible), I felt sick to my stomach. I threw it in the trash."
3,Tried it,Tried it but probably would not buy it again. Bitter and needs lots of sugar to get it down and after using the whole box every day did not notice any differences.
5,Cancer treatment??,"My wife was diagnosed with cancer. Imagine my surprise to read of some data indicating dandelion tea has some good effects for cancer patients. I can remember as a child my grandmother making dandelion tea, but back then, this and chamomile was all we had. If you could not find it growing outside, you were not going to have it. The taste is fine but I am leaving most of it to her to drink."
2,"It was just ""okay""",The several of the tea bags were opened at the bottom rendering them unusuable. Had to throw away. Very disappointed
3,"Not very tasty, but it'll do.",I bought this product as part of a Jillian Michael recipe to lose water weight. It doesn't taste very good but it's not disgusting either. I'd buy it again if I had to. I did have to wait two weeks longer than expected to receive this item. I don't know if it was the company or USPS taking its sweet time so I will not point fingers at any party.
2,Didn't last 2 months for me,I used it in my golf rangefinder but sadly it didn't last two months. I usually use it once a week when I play. The last one I had lasted for almost 1 season.
2,battery life,The battery life of the battery was less than half straight out of the package. I guess I get what I pay for.
3,Average,"There is no special reason to buy this soundtrack. I only bought it for sentimentality reasons. I would say that the opening and closing songs are the best on this CD. The rest just seams like your average ""old"" anime tunes that help set the mood in the movie. If you have seen ""Macross II"" and liked the music, than go ahead and buy this CD if you wish. Otherwise I don't think it's anything you should randomly buy and than hope that you will like it."
1,TRICKED BY FRAGGLES!,"I bought this dvd thinking it was a ""christmas special"" only to be tricked by the cover and title to find out its actually 3 episodes from the series that are already on the boxset I own. The episodes are ""The Bells of Fraggle Rock"", The Grapes of Generosity"" and ""The perfect Blue Rollie"". As far as extras, i havent watched them yet but not only was I folled by the title, they add as an extra ""Emmit Otter's Jug-band Christmas singalong""..umm anything original guys? Also included was an animated epiosde, ""a look at Jim Henson's The Christmas Toy"" and 2 games.If you dont already own the seasons or the box set then get this dvd for holiday fun, But if you already own the series, you already have the episodes and we all have to come to the realization that there is no offical ""Fraggle holiday special"" :("
2,Clever...but boring.,"This is the kid of movie that critics love because its something different. (Movie within a movie, etc.) Even though its mostly improvised there is something totally unreal about it all. The women are too beautiful, the lesbian stuff doesn't wash and the gun business is just phony. If you want to see a brilliant example of different stories colliding in an exciting way see GO."
1,FALL ASLEEP or GET A HEADACHE,A little hype for nothing. Many of the lines in this movie are directly taken from other groundbreaking artists -- most obviously Chekhov -- regarding new artistic forms. While the attempt at artistic form was made...the story really lacks anything worthwhile. Enter the world of Figgis and you'll need some heavy duty aspirin.
1,Interesting concept poorly executed.,"Don't buy this. Rent it with NetFlix instead.While the concept is very interesting, the execution is poor. I keep having a hard time hearing the different dialog in the movie... Also, the character are all stereotypical ""LA entertainment crowd"" which, personally, I am not interested in their story/life..."
4,A very original movie....,"...This movie takes advantage of digital photography to allowthe screen to be divided into four seperate views (each a different camera). The story happens in ""real time"" as you see characters move from one part of the screen to another. This might sound confusing but only one or two views have important action going on at a particular time and every once in a while there is a minor earthquake, guess this is in L.A. or something, that reminds you that this is all happening at the same time. The story really is too complicated to get into, it involves a jealous lesbian lover, an independant film studio, and the world's worst musician."
1,Quite possibly the most irritating movie ever made.,"Sure, it's very innovative: 4 screens all at once, no editing, and one take. Unfortunately, not all original ideas should see the light of day. This movie has basically no story, it is just a 90 minute long take of 4 different cameras. THAT'S ALL. There is not a compelling enough storyline to keep a sane viewer engaged. Thankfully the volume is brought up on the important shot that the director wants us to watch, but that doesn't save this mess. I don't understand what people see in this movie besides it's originality. Just because an idea is new, does not mean it's a good one.This is just one big mess, and one of the most ANNOYING AND FRUSTRATING MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN."
3,Innovative.,"4 digital cameras. 4 quadrants. 4 continuous shots. All in real time. All improvised. Mike Figgis (Leaving Las Vegas) is definitely one of the most innovative directors out there. And that's what makes the film worth seeing. It wasn't as challenging as I thought it would be to follow all four quadrants at the same time. Figgis turns the volume up on the shot he wants you to pay attention to. The cast does a fine job, although I'm not exactly sure what Salma Hayak is doing in this company. Stellan Skarsgard is great as usual. Jeanne Tripplehorn is literally on screen in a continuous shot for the length of the film and she is fantastic. Look out for Holly Hunter, who has very little screen time, but who gives her character more depth than this film deserves. The reason I only gave this film 3 stars is that it didn't engage me. Watch it for its stylistic qualities and not for its story. I recommend the DVD format. After all, digital cameras deserve digital video."
4,Great Indie Film - Loved It.,"Time Code is an excellent example of what film can and should be. It's definitely an experiment that the affordability of digital video allows. Shot on a Sony digitial video camera, Mike Figgis has woven a great story. The screen is split into four separate quardants, four intertwining, and simultaneous, storylines. I defy you to follow a single set of characters. Figgis uses sound to draw you through the story, raising and lowering the levels of different quads he'd like you to be looking at. It's excellent filmmaking. It is a challenging watch, but not as hard to follow as you might think. This excellent DVD version has an entire other ""version 1"" of the film which even features different actors. It's great fun. Highly recommended to the Indie Film Fan. Best regards, turtlex."
3,Interesting...,"Mike Figgis' experimental foray into digital media is a film shot completely in real time and played out over a screen divided into quarters. You watch four small screens all at once and while inventive, it's more than a little gimmicky. It does have a great cast though, including Selma Hayek and Stellan Skarsgrd. If you've ever seen the Polish art films of Zbig Rybczynski, this will remind you of them."
1,This could have been the greatest movie of all time...,... if only it had a plot.I give it one star because I admire Figgis' innovation and risk taking. Otherwise I would have to delve into the negatives.Overindulgent is a word that comes to mind.
3,"Split screens, confusion, dizziness, great film!!!!",Time code opened my eyes & ears immediately when i heard it was going to be split into 4 separate screens. The way Mike Figgs came up with this idea is incredible! I have to admit that this film can get you confused with all the thing happening all at the same time. But that's the magic in this whole film. The Actors/Actresses in this film are excellent with improvising their acting capabilities; it really pushes them to the limit.
1,possibly the worst movie ever,"Good Idea. Bad Movie. Not only is there little to no story, there are mistakes like a boom mic comming into the shot and a camera man's hand in the shot holding open a door. Even with four shots going on at the same time nothing happens. I would rather see 4 different angles of grass growing."
5,An Amazing Document for Opera's Golden Age,"This is an absolute ""must have"" for any opera fan. They don't do it like this anymore and it will show you just WHY Corelli, Tebaldi, Bastianini and Christoff are held in such high esteem. An important if not THE most important video document of opera in the 1950's."
1,Defective DVD,"The DVD was defective. About the middle of the 2nd act, ""Error, Cannot read disc"" came on and DVD stopped."
4,Not quite the old vinyl,"The last time I heard Rheinberger's great Organ Concerti was from an old vinyl record of E. Power Biggs at the console with Georges Prtre conducting. Absolutely beautiful! I knew that Spang-Hassen and Bostock had their work cut out for them to approach, much less equal the old recording. But surprise, surprise! Once I got over the differences between the two albums (and there are differences; thankfully these are artists, not machines), Rheinberger's wonderful music unfolded in the most captivating way. Hey, this is wonderful listening, and to be recommended to all organ afficionados! But guess what? The vinyl recording is better!!"
2,Disappointing!,"This book reads more like a tourist guide than a novel. It seems as if the author has visited Mexico and wants to record her reactions to it rather than create artistically structured fiction. Characters are unconvincing, sentences are long and unstructured, and the narrative style shows little skill. A forgetable novel."
3,Mediocre,"""The Zigzag Way"" is a short book, almost novella size, without a great deal of character development. It does have a shifting cast of characters unified by the willingness to change the familiar for something new, Em being the exception, and also the one character with no real connection to Mexico. At the end the protagonist, unlike his father, still has not found what that something new will be. For a slim book, there was an historical dimension which was valuable, but it almost seems like Desai was also seeking a spiritual experience in Mexico which turned out to be disappointing. The concluding scene has some emotional power, but just doesn't add up to anything really significant. While Desai can create fine metaphors, there were times I felt they were inserted when no metaphor was called for, so that they simply brought attention to themselves. On a personal note, I was better able to visualize Em because I had recently seen the movie ""Kinky Boots"", and pictured the fiancée."
3,Routine but moderately entertaining,"The plot has little new to offer and the players are generally competent but nothing special. Nevertheless, this is not a bad way to wile away your time without the need for intense involvement. We start with a failed attempt at a murder which has the look of a series of them which have recently occurred. The potential victim is a student of clinical psychiatry, which works nicely since the focus is on the psychological analysis of the attacker who believes he has lived many past lives. Has He? What is behind his beliefs. The plot unravels these hardly very tight knots with a bit of romance thrown in. Not among the better of the Clark based television films."
3,I HAD A HARD TIME READING THIS,"For some reason I had a hard time maintaining interest in this book. I love me some Fred, but I guess I was wanting to read more about James Brown. Mayby I didn`t give this book a fair chance first time around. I`m going back and read it again."
1,Movies like this give indie films a bad name,Poor quality in story line and acting. Everyone is just trying too hard. I went looking forward to a good laugh and it was painful to watch. Just plain awful. Do yourself a favor don't even bother not worth the time.
1,Painful to Watch,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I was excited when I saw who was in it, but the story line is pitiful."
2,a come on,"I bought this because it says starring Tony Sirico,Tony is more of acameo ,the main guy in this I remember in a oldPacific Blue episode.Kind of funny but just average entertainment"
4,"Well-mixed, thoughtful lyrics, original music.","This sophomore CD builds upon the band's first release, ""Reason"", but it is better mixed (I can hear Michelle singing now!), and offers up even more enigmatic lyrics that really prompt you to think. Great tunes abound, keeping your toes tapping..."
4,Mindy's Debut,"Ten Thousand Angels was Mindy's first breakthrough album in country music, also her debut album. She travelled to Nashville, told her parents if she didnt have a record deal within a year she would return home and go to college, and about 50 weeks after being in Nashville, she was signed with BNA Nashville. The debut single Ten Thousand Angels was a popular hit and made it well on the charts, but the real breakthrough on the album was the woman's anthem Guys Do It All The Time, which will always be remembered for its sassyness and honesty, a fun song which hit #1. The 10 tracks on the album each reflect a different side of Mindy, both playful and fun, as well as serious and strong. Other singles include the duet with Richie McDonald from Lonestar called Maybe He'll Notice Her Now, the anthem A Girl's Gotta Do (What A Girl's Gotta Do). Other mentionable songs include All That I Am, Breakin It, and It Ain't A Party. Go out and get this spectacular debut by one of country's best singers."
2,Hot and Sexy don't mean you're good,Geeze Louise.. how many hot chicks do I have to watch on CMT trying to sing country. Singers like this will never stand the test of time. I can't believe the radio plays her songs. The DJ's just hope she stops by their station when she's on tour so they get a peak. Don't judge a CD by its cover.
4,Jailhouse rocks!,Listening to this album will take you back to the late 80s and early 90s. Amir is amazing on guitar and Danny's vocals are just on. They are definitely a live band so having those live tracks on the album are a plus. Well done boys!
4,Excellent,"Excellent book...well written, painstakingly researched, and extremely accurate. Read this book and you'll know why Southerners still don't trust Yankees and you'll understand why the ""War of Northern Aggression"" is still being fought today."
1,This book is completely ridiculous.,"If you are looking for an entertaining and often hilarious piece of fiction, this is definitely the book for you. If, however, you would like a factual book on Southern history, then you would be better off looking elsewhere. I can't remember the last time I read anything so completely absurd. But I do appreciate the many laughs the author gave me.And no, I am not a Yankee. I was born in the South and my family has been here for generations."
5,A must for every Proud Southerner,This book is the Southern handbook. It Proudly demonstrates ou Proud Southern Heritage.
3,Southern by the Grace of God,"It was good on some History I did not know. For example, it gave good insight on some Southern Leaders.Obviously it was strickly Southern point of view. Don't get me wrong, I am a native born Texan, thereforeSouthern by birth."
3,Just ok for the price,"I have had this projector screen set up and in use now for a month or two and thought I would leave some important feedback for anyone looking as hard as I did before buying a screen. The main thing I want to mention/warn potential buyers about is that the bottom 25% of the screen has ""ripples"" that appear, quite obviously, during movie scenes where the camera pans slowly across a landscape.I emailed Elite Screens customer service/warranty and was told too bad, all of their manual screens have this problem and they wont replace/fix any of it. I was pretty disappointed and suggested that they add to the product description ""All of our manual screens have a HIGH chance of ripple effect and is to be expected"". If that was in the description I would have not purchased it."
4,never had a problen,"Screen arrived on time in g0od condition, easily installed and has been working well since it arrived in my country Trinidad. Good product.Frank Johnetty"
2,Waves,"I bought this screen about a week ago and right out of the box the bottom half of the screen had several big waves. It looks even worse now, with more ripples formed. In still scenes it seems ok but in slow moving scenes the effects of the waves are awful. The bottom of the screen is stapled to some thin pressed wood material.The screen is very cheap but I think I got what I paid for it. I wouldn't recommend this product."
5,Excellent screen,"I have been using this screen for a year now. Works very nicely. It's remained flat even though I leave the screen open most of the time. Personally, I prefer these over the power operated screen: there are fewer parts to break and easier to install."
4,Projector Screen,"Came quickly and is huge! Good for home theatre set ups for those who use projectors for movies, gaming etc."
4,"I love, but now getting waves in the screen","I like this screen, the movies come out really good. However, lately I have seen waves/wrinkles developing in the screen. At first it was a few, now it has doubled. It is becoming annoying, especially on bright scenes (outdoors shots) where this cause a lot of shadows on the screens. I got it back in May 2011, so haven't had it that long. Perhaps I need to store it more often, I tend to keep the screen out a lot. I don't know, but already thinking about replacing with fix screen or the tab tension. I did some research and come to find out this happens a lot with pull down screens. If I had known, I would had paid the extra bucks for an upgrade. Lesson learn, and hope that lesson passes on to others."
4,Its not black,I ordered this because of the price and the pictures of this item is black. Well i got it and it is white. I did not even attempt to send it back because of the cost alone. besides being white it is a good screen. Ive had it for a few weeks now and have it permantly mounted on my wall. I have had to put it up about 6 times with no problems. Well worth the money.
4,Excellent Screen,"My wife and I just purchased a 1080P Projector for our bedroom. We were going to paint our screen on the wall, but after looking into the cost of theater quality paints we decided to look at screens. Of course the motorized screens selling for $2000-$5000 dollars were out of the question, but we were a little dubious about purchasing this screen as it was so incredibly affordable. We took a chance and we couldn't be happier! It was a snap to install, the screen size is perfect for watching 16:9 movies. The screen hangs flat and has a solid feel and the action pulling down and rolling up feels solid. I don't know if it will last 10 years, but for the price, we couldn't be happier!"
1,Worst screen ever !,The screen takes about 20 tries to pull up ! ...I think the problem is the screen is thin and the edges curl inward and create a drag. Also the edge curl causes the Picture on the screen to distort . Not very happy with this purchase. Sorry nothing nice to say about this screen.
4,Good bargain screen.,"It's good quality, but it does not stay planar. It warps and bends and just doesn't stay ""flat.""Next time, I'm going fixed frame. I never put it ""up"" ever anyway."
4,Meets Expectations!,"This screen met all my expectations when I installed it and started watching movies. The installation was very easy and obvious. Dimension published on manufacturer's web site does not include this screen model but I was able to guess it based on similar model with black case (This model has white case and image published by Amazon on product page is misleading). I have been using this screen almost daily since last two weeks- opening, projecting movies on it and closing, and so far its performance has been solid. Picture is vivid and sharp. I really don't know any other way to evaluate the projector screen. I bet more knowledgeable folks would have better technical feedback however it does get two thumbs up from me."
4,Decent screen with few flaws,"OK I am a first time projector guy (choose optoma HD20) and I was looking for a reasonably priced screen for my loft. I came across this screen and it has a good price point and reviews.Pros:* Good price for the size.* The Elite screens website has good information on dimensions etc, with that you can do pricese mount.* The back of the screen has black lining which is very important for drakening when mounted over a window.Cons:* There are small wrinkles on the screen, when you are watching CNN or CNBC where at the bottom letters scroll, you can see them riding on a wave in few places.* They should sold the L brackets with the screen, additional $30 (from [...]) is not acceptable. I can see most people would be mounting using the L brackets over a window etc.Overall I like this screen but with some minor disappointments."
4,Great screen for a great price!,"After reading the reviews, we were very nervous about the sturdiness of the product, but have found it to be great! When it arrived, we handled with care, and had it mounted very quickly once we had visited the hardware store. (Note: if you are mounting into drywall or want to do a ceiling mount, you will need extra hardware!) We have now used the screen for over a week almost every day, and we do NOT leave it in the down position as that is not practical for us. As I said, because of the negative reviews, my husband took a little extra care when pulling the screen down and retracting it, but we have had no issues. The screen looks great up, it looks great with the projected picture, and we really love it and wish we'd bought one sooner. As to picture quality - I think I notice a difference, my husband feels like it's as good as when we projected on a white wall in the past. Overall: very satisfied here!"
1,saved by the reviews,"Based on the reviews that this screen is obviously of very poor quality and workanship, the manufacturer has the nerve to charge $157.50 for shipping on an item that weighs 18 pounds!!!Looking at TigerDirect's standard shipping rate of .50 lb, the item would have to weigh close to 300 pounds to substantiate that rate for shipping! I guess they're trying to make up for such an inferior product by bilking the public for more money.I guess anything is legal now when it comes to screwing people!!"
1,weak construction,"This size screen is long enough that the flimsy method used of attaching the inner roller to the endcaps causes the plastic bits to be broken during shipping. I just recieved my second screen from amazon after the first was broken by ups(once the plastic part it broken it will not retract) and this one shows the same damage. Amazon customer service was great about sending another screen, but I fear that the manufacturing weakness will make any further shipments a waste of time. Elitescreens customer service is disorganised and not helpfull."
1,Doesnt Work,"I ordered this huge screen and took all the time to properly measure and hang. I pulled down the screen and then hung my projector at the proper distance and angle and thought everything was perfect. I then went to put the screen back up. Soon recognized that the screen only went in one direction... Down! The roller is broken and doesnt retract at all. I can get it to go up about 2 feet, but not even close to retracting all the way. Now, I have some big eyesore in the middle of a room that it doesn't belong. Its a permanent ugly fixture. I wish I would have just got a fixed frame, it would look much better. When I took the screen out of the box I messed the box up too much to use it to send it back in. It was such a long box, it would be impossible to find something to send this thing back in. So I am stuck with this huge eyesore!"
1,Piece of junk!!!,"Against my better judgement, I went with this model -- despite its scathing reviews. As soon as I opened it, I knew I was in for it. I could hear a ball bearing rolling around loose in the internal canister of the spool. I held it up, and the screen rolled right out with absolutely no tension whatsoever. Needless to say, it did not roll back up. I took off the end cap, and noticed right away that the plastic clutch drive was broken in half. I put the cap back on and called amazon. Fortunately, I ordered through Amazon -- as the gave no hassle whatsoever. I just packed it back up, and put it on my porch for UPS. They're sending me one more. If it works, cool. If not, I'm being refunded, and going with a different company. Buyer beware. If you're going to buy this one. Buy it through the Amazon warehouse. They are hassle free."
1,Arrived broken,"The projector came with one endcap seriously cracked. Possibly related, the screen won't stay pulled down. So I put a weight on it and hammered down the metal thing that it hangs on. Every time I pull down on it I'm expecting it to come crashing down on me."
1,Very poor quality product,"This screen was delivered with severe wrinkles both vertically and horizontally. I hung it open in hopes that they would hang out, but the vertical wrinkles became worse. This makes horizontal lines appear to be crooked and it distorts movement. This is worse than a white wall for home video. The bottom clamp on the screen was assembled without any attempt to properly stretch the lower part of the screen. The result is an unwatchable image at this size. I have now read several reviews both here and elsewhere online which mention the same issue. It is not a small problem. Avoid this product. I am trying to return my screen and have gone back to my 80 inch DaLite."
1,Poor Poor Poor,"This screen has to be one of the cheapest pieces of junk, if going to retract it up and down alot, don't buy it. If you want really good picture quality don't buy it, I can spot all the little shiny dots and I'm using a benq w500 hd projector, if for instance you are watching something bright like hockey, all over the white ice i can just pick up on all the flaws of the screen. Warrenty is like dealing with a bunch of pot heads, won't get no place with the. I'm going to try a different brand I hope i enjoy it better!"
4,Good product,"This screen was easy to wall mount and work as expected. No issues so far. I use it outside, mounted under patio cover so not exposed to weather. Have to be careful of bugs and moths on the screen when rolling up as they get smashed. So far I have been able to clean off without stain residue."
3,Decent entry-level screen,"This is a good choice for an inexpensive manual gray screen. I paired it with a 720p LCD projector to enhance the perceived contrast. The picture looks great - though this is my first screen and I have no basis of comparison. The whites are acceptably white and the blacks are improved by the gray screen surface.Negatives: The metal case came out of the box with a dent and several scratches on it. This did not affect the screen's performance, and it is not too noticeable from a distance. Also, the screen does curl a bit on the left and right edges, but this is not a distraction for me.All in all, I consider this screen a good deal for the price."
2,It broke on the first try,"The first thing that I heard after hanging this manually operated 100"" screen was the sound of breaking plastic followed by the sight of all the screen pouring out of the bottom never to be retracted again. I took the screen down, took the end cap off and found broken plastic parts inside.After I filled out a long waranty form, Elitescreens promised to send me a new endcap, but it remains to be seen if I will be able to install it myself. I rate this a 2 Stars because it could still have a happy ending."
3,Training Center,"The nominal size of the screen is deceptive as it measures 136 inches diagonally only if the screen is used as a 6 by 6 projection surface. Since most projectors either project with an aspect ratio of 4:3 or more commonly the 16:9 widescreen the actual useful diagonal measurement is only 110 inches. This means that I had to remount my projector much closer than I planned on for the image to fit on my screen. I wish I had ordered a larger screen. Nowhere in the ad description did it warn me that the 136 is a 45 degree diagonal. Gee, makes me wish I still had grandpa's old slide projector!"
1,get what you pay for,"I ordered this Elite screen after receiving 2 defective Ultra 100"" screens. The customer service rep assured me these were more sturdy, yet it arrived with parts loose rattling around inside and the screen just unraveled out instead of the spring-loaded stuff, and will never go back in. The reviews for Elite screens are even WORSE than the reviews for Ultra screens. These under $100 screens seem to be worth it only if you are prepared to leave it hanging down always."
1,bad screen,the screen have folding marks from the top to the bottom maybe an old unit sitting for ages to be sold.I am trying DA-lite a little more expensive but hopefully no folding marks on the screen.
1,not go back into the holder...,"I installed screen, and it was possible to expand it.However, the screen not go back into the holder... I also...I returned it."
1,don't buy this screen,I opened the box to this elite screen placed it on the wall and immediately it began rolling down.The screen would not retract back to any position.I sent it back to the company.I also have a friend that has the same one with the same problem.they need to get rid of thes screens.
1,Damaged during shipping,"Screen is big, bulky and poorly packaged. The first time I received the screen, it was damaged during shipping. The second time, when I received the replacement, it also arrived damaged. This time I opted for a refund. Repacking and handling for return is difficult and annoying. Although the replacement shipment was prompt, the refund was not."
4,still working,"I've been using mine for about 4 months. In the beginning, it was difficult to make it go up, but I read these reviews before it arrived, so I was very careful with it. Now, my wife and 10 year old son can get it to go up on the first try. It takes a lot of finesse to make it retract, but once you figure out the proper wrist action, it usually goes up on the first try.So far, it hasn't peeled off of the roller yet, and I've been using it all summer in a sometimes warm condo. (we live in VT, so the heat isn't normally a factor up here).I like the picture quality of the screen. We used a bare wall with flat paint before this. The only problem is, 100"" is still too small! Our projector puts out an image larger than the screen. Oops."
1,Broke within two months!!!!!!,"Don't buy this garbage. Like another reviewer, I had the screen lock in the full down position. I heard a snap sound and it would not go back up. I did NOT pull too hard.It was in the down position for about two days and then the screen literally fell out of the mechanism!!!! The screen is duck taped to the roller. I found the piece that broke was a cheap piece of plastic inside the roller that holds the spring.VERY CHEAP"
2,Junk screen,"Ok had this for a couple weeks now when I noticed that the screen was hanging at a angle. I took the screen off the wall and took one of the end caps off, the side that dosnt have the wind mech on it. I was surprised to find that the female part that holds the spindle was broken before then glued. Very cheap. I am not going to go through the bull of sending this thing back so I re-glued with some strong epoxy. Dont buy from this company. I find a company who fixes something then sells at a brand new price cant be trusted. If I could give no stars I would. I wont recommend them that is a fact."
2,Limited mounting options and crooked screen despite limited use,"I selected based on price. For a kids playroom to run Xbox etc. I seldom raise/lower the screen, so felt a manual would work fine. Mounting proved to be challenging because there are only two non-movable rings at each end. These unfortunately did not line up with my wall studs. I was able to come up with a solution, but it took some additional time that could have otherwise been avoided.After 2 months, I noticed that the screen did not raise/lower evenly. It was also not hanging down evenly. It looks like the glue at the top of one side side started to not hold, causing the screen to not be even.I've not replaced it because it is not majorly noticeable when playing games..but I'd be fairly annoyed if it were a part of a high end home theater."
2,Wrinkle problem,The screen has horizonal wrinkles about every foot. It was probably folded a long time before it was installed into the casing. Not thrilled with it.
2,nice,"this started. out awesome only 66 dollars but it does not retract now :( i have another screen 144"" and never had any probs out of it ....same brand. ill deal with it and it does have a nice picture but it will get bad soon because it will never roll up."
3,Mounting hardware NOT INCLUDED,"The good: The screen is beautifully made, seems to pull down and retract with ease. Very good color reproduction for a screen at this cost. Lightweight, very good at blocking light as the back is black.The Bad: The instructions included are a joke. It references screws and drywall anchors that are not included, even though it states they are. Comes with more advertisements for Elite products than actual instructions.The description states ""Available in Black or White case color"". I received a white one, not sure if it's a crap shoot, or if I was supposed to specify somewhere.Installation is ridiculously easy even without referencing the instructions. Measure distance between keyholes. Drill 2 holes that distance apart. Insert drywall anchors you probably have in your kitchen drawer. Insert screws. Hang screen. Watch movie.It would easily be a 5 star product if not for the lack of instructions, and lack of installation hardware."
4,Pretty good screen!,"I'm no expert on screens but this screen has worked nicely for the 3 days we've had it up. Installation took five minutes. It has ""keyholes"" for hanging it on a wall as well as steel loops for hanging from a ceiling or other such vertical installation. The retraction mechanism has worked flawlessly so far."
2,Cheap Product,"The Elite screen arrived broken and I spent hours trying to find out why it was not retractable. Then I contacted the seller, the seller told me to contact the manufacturer. Initially they tried to mail me the broken part, it did not help. So the manufacturer mail me a new screen. I told them to test it to before mailing me junk :-). They did test it and it has been working since then. However I don't expect it to last for more than 1-2 years. You can tell it is not very durable."
4,viewing pleasure,"bit heavy but works well, installed quickly and rolls down and up without sticking. Improved my view compared to the white wall but not dramatically so - hence 4 stars instead of 5. Overall happy with the purchase"
2,Very disapointed.,We were very sad to open our package to a broken screen holder. The screen is fine itself but the thing that's suppose to hold it up was broken so we could not hang it.. Just poor shipping i guess...
3,Color is not what it shows on the title.,"I purchased this product understanding that the case will be white. The manufacturer offer in black and white. The title says 'Matte White' and doesn't say anything else about the case. The technical description says they offer in both color. When I received it it was black! There is no option while ordering process to specify the case color - much to my surprice!The title as it appears: ""Elite Screens Manual Pull Down Projection Screen, 16:9 Aspect Ratio-92in (Matte White)""Even the picture shown is white case!There must be an option to specify which one to buy! Even though they offer in both color, how do I select the one I want? - instead of what they decide to provide after you pay!Elite Screens Manual Pull Down Projection Screen, 16:9 Aspect Ratio-92in (Matte White)"
1,Did not even get it up on the wall before it failed!!!!!!!!!!!,"As we lifted the screen up on to the wall, the screen unrolled all the way and that was the end of that! It will simply not retract! What a horrible purchase!"
2,Avoid,"The was screen was partially ripped at the bottom, on its arrival. Therefore, this caused waves to form throughout the screen. However, the picture does look nice but that is surely the Epson 8350 doing. AVOID if you can..strange smell as well."
1,Screen material ripping at bottom,"I was thrilled to find a 150-inch screen (4:3) for under $200 shipped. My excitement quickly disappeared when after only a few uses, the corners are tearing away from the pull-down bar. The screen material is stapled to two small, thin wooden strips on the bottom edge. A metal tube with an open slit (and the pull handle) fits over this. However, the staples are ripping right through the fabric at both corners. So far we have close to 1/4 of the material on each side ripped away. Very weird since the pull handle is in the middle and there it is not ripping (yet). Hopefully we will be able to fix this ... not quite sure what to use to attach the fabric to the wooden strips, but will figure something out. Very disappointing. Unfortunately, there were no other reviews for this product when I bought it. I would not buy this product again. This is in a business setting and did not get installed right away which is why we didn't attempt any return through Amazon."
1,Spring mechanism broken out of the box!,"Brought the box in and when I truned it upright to walk through my hallway I could hear loose parts falling inside the screen housing. Openned box, read instructions and cautiously pulled screen out. The screen came out very easily as if it was not even spring loaded. I was not surprised though, because it would not go back in. Removed the end cap to find the end cap retainer block was in pieces (this is what holds the load on the spring). The plastic is of very poor quality. It is not able to withstand the loads that the spring has on it. So, I am stuck with a screen that will not go up. I would highly recommend another manufacturer. As for me, I will not purchase any other product from Elite."
3,Elite (4:3) Manual Pull Down Projection Screen,Elite (4:3) Manual Pull Down Projection Screen - 113in.The screen was delivered on time and it works. More than I can say for government.
5,projector screen,"its actually 93 inches horizontally, but thats expected, its measured diagonally to be 100 inches. but so far so good, it seems to roll down and back up just fine, looks nice and give you a good image to look at when you use a good projector, looking behind the screen you will notice that no light gets thru which is important so that ambient light or lights behind the screen wont effect the picture quality.overall im very happy and i havent found a better deal anywhere else for a nice 100 inch screen."
2,A poor quality product,"After one year using in my home the internal system pull-down was broken. Its a poor little plastic piece less than $1.00 value. If you contact ELITE screen manufacture they ask you have to buy a new one because they don`t sell the plastic piece. Really a poor product, poor after sale attention. After all for a $100.00 price cost What we can receive ????"
4,Serves its purpose,"The screen is of good quality. It is a little fussy about going back up most times (operator error?). For wide screen (16.9) projection, it is only 70"" wide and gives a 77"" maximum diagonal picture."
4,Works great,"Have not had any problems it is working great. Was easy to install, and not have any problems. Great price for a great screen."
3,"The screen was heavier than I anticipated, but manageable.","The length and width go well with my Epson Moviemate 62 projector. There are a few wrinkles that haven't gone away, even after several weeks. They don't show much when viewing only when screen isn't being used. The viewing is very pleasureable, much better than wall, even painted with projector paint."
2,Not good,"Bad build quality out of the box. First time I pulled the screen down, the roller mechanism fell off and it took me a long time to fix it. The damn thing is to big that shipping it back was more of a headache than fixing it myself. If you plan on leaving the screen down all the time, then yeah, this unit is worth the price. If you are planning on rolling up after every viewing, then forget it. Get a better quality one."
1,Elite Screen projection screen,"I should have listened to the other reviews. The screen does not ""pull down"" or ""retract"" properly. The mechanism seems jammed or low functioning. Much effort has to be taken to ""pull down"" the screen causing a loud clicking or banging sound as the screen rotates. To retract I must manually press my fingers into the roller frame work and work the ""roll"" in circles to get the screen to retract a few inches at a time. Returning is costly. I plan on making due until it completely breaks and I will by another model from another company. If you plan on having the screen permanently deployed this may be an o.k. product."
3,Great screen for the money,"Bought this screen based on price. It is worth the price when compared to how much you can spend on a screen. The picture is good and clear. Also we chose the pull down option since I didn't want a huge white wall to stare at when not watching movies.If you're a videophile, you may want to look elsewhere. The screen is not flat and has many waves and ripples. We spent quite a while trying to square up the picture only to find out the screen is not flat. It curls up on the sides and is wavy across the bottom. It doesn't bother me too much when watching movies but look forward to when I can afford a better screen. In addition, I wish it had more continues stops when pulling down. I need it to come down another inch but if i pull it any more it rolls up.Overall, I am happy with the screen and expect to get a couple years out of it before upgrading. I would certainly recommend for someone who does not want to put out huge money for a screen."
5,This Projector Screen,Great screen! Mounted to wall and looks good! Housing is metal...not plastic. The picture looks perfect on it. Ver happy with this product!
2,Received item quickly but with problem,"Received the item within a couple day, but found couple dents on it and had to return for a refund."
3,"Good Screen, but be warned","As with many of the other reviews, expect this product to come damaged due to poor packaging by the manufacturer. Dented at one end which hindered the opening and closing of the screen."
5,Great Economical Home Theater Screen,"We have a totally dark, dedicated theater with 12 seats in 3 rows. The screen was easily mounted directly to the wall with 2 screws into two studs (measure very carefully if you want to get it right first time). Used two six foot ladders and balanced it on top of both. My teenage son and I completed installation in about 45 minutes.Screen is just what I expected and it has really become the finishing touch for our dedicated room. We do not raise or lower it, so the retractable feature was secondary for us.If your wall will take it and your projector can fill it...this is a fabulous screen."
1,Fell apart on the 7th use!,"The screen itself is OK for viewing projected images if you just pull it down, but not too far, and leave it down forever. Just forget about retracting it, as the mechanism is so frail that it only retracted 6 times, then would no longer go up, and fell out of the case after hanging down a few hours. It is held onto the roller by sticky tape only. Elite said they'd replace it, but want me to pay for shipping and the charge would be more than I paid for the product! Since it came out of the case, I just hung it on the wall until I get one that works."
5,The Lord Is A Wonder,"I love this cd. I dont think there is anything that I could say I havent enjoyed about it. The traditional songs and the traditional sound bless my soul. I will tell you when I get in my car and start listening to this cd everyone on the road is going to church because I play it loud. Wonderful, everyone should own this cd."
3,Its good...in some areas....,"I just ordered my 2nd case. MY first one is battered, bent and doesn't always latch. But it is 6 months old now and I hate to think what my Palm would be like without the case! I tried the B0000665QW from Palm - I just didn't like the feel, or the grip and it stopped latching on me after only 2 months. Yes I'm hard on my cases and my Palm spends alot time in the front pocket of my slacks which means I catch alot of table/desk corners.Bottom line...this is just as durable as others BUT I like the flip up (instead of open as book) cover and how I still hold it in one hand and often times, I holding and pressing the buttons/screens with the same hand! Dollar of dollar, (...)"
4,Preambles of faith,"I can see why Avery Dulles is a respected theologian and a pastoral person. Accessible, lucid, simple yet profound ""The New World of Faith"" captures in such a succinct and attractive style the teaching of the Roman tradition. Not for the expert but for the searcher - the pilgrim needing to be accompanied on their way. Placed in their hand this book provides a tool to help understand some of the divisive issues the Roman tradition holds. Whether inquiring alone or looking for a book to stimulate a group discussion, this book should not be overlooked."
4,Music to make the heart sing!,"I'm giving this 2-cd set 4 stars (instead of 5) because I wasn't intoxicated by EVERY song, although I do like them all. I feel this is a good value for the price. All the songs are good, but my two FAVORITE songs in this set are ""Lucky You"" (Jollification) and ""Like You Do"" (Dizzy Heights). I've played these two songs especially heavily, because they fill me with feelings of elation (they're aural uppers)! It figures that both of these songs are results of Ian Broudie's collaboration with Terry Hall, whose music I dearly love (I assume the same Terry Hall of The Specials, Colourfield, and Fun Boy Three fame). I recently heard ""Lucky You"" on BBC 6 Radio (on the web) and I was hooked within seconds. I had to own it immediately. Of course, when I found out that Jollification was ""unavailable"" in the U.S., that whetted my appetite further. Ian creates music that is cheery without being sappy or corny. Happy, happy, happy!"
4,Good tasting,"This trail mix was good because it had healthy ingredients and lacked all the fake stuff others include. My husband really enjoyed this as did my daughter. We can't buy it again since my son is allergic to peanuts now. Otherwise, I would buy it again. Good price here too."
5,This was my introduction to the Weirdoes,"I love this album. The tunes are catchy, the beats driving, the songwriting is unself-consciously and enthusiastically abstract and nonsensical."
4,"If you enjoy Frampton's work, you cannot skip this one","This is a veryg ood album by Frampton. Of course, we have the all time classis title track here, but the other songs (except one or tow losers) are very good. There's a cover of Vanda and Young ""Friday On My Mind"" that sounds very good. Also, help was hried in the form of guitar solid rent-man Steve Lukather.Good album, it will not disappoint."
4,"Excellent post ""Comes Alive"" effort","I originally bought this album in vinyl, sometime after its initial release. I think it's a great record -- Frampton had descended from his exalted position atop the rock kingdom after the enormously successful live album and a couple of disappointing subsequent studio efforts. This record is basic rock and roll, showcasing Frampton's skills as a guitarist. A lot of the songs sound like they are recorded ""live"" in the studio, which is Frampton's obvious strength."
3,Too far the other way...,"On the plus side, the book is well-researched and reads well. Author is a good writer and the prose flows well. It is also organized logically, and the author is unafraid to make conclusions based upon what he finds in the evidence and documents. The problem is that the author bends over backwards to provide an alternative explanation/interp of GMB. While an author is to be applauded for giving readers a different take on the subject, here we get too much of it. To mention one example, read the author's conclusion @ McClellan's performance during the Peninsula Campaign of 1862. Talk about spin! Talk about putting the best face upon a disaster! It reads liek GBM wrote the exculpatory paragraphs himself. It is one thing to revise one's interp on the general, but to do so with with the gusto of a Mormon apologist is another. Still, if one is interested in GBM, it is worth reading."
4,Pleased to have more of his music...,"This album from Thierry Cham was much-awaited around here; we had been so very fond of 'Autrement,' and were thrilled to see a new cd available via Amazon.We are looking for more of the Zouk style, and less of the French pop sounds, and I'm slightly less pleased with 'Ma Couleur' for that reason. It seems more highly produced, and with more obvious attempts to mainstream the sound (female chorus, english rap) it didn't provide that rich original experience.With luck, we will eventually move back over Cham's career, and somehow find some of his older cds (Simplement, Naturel, Nuit Blanche, etc.) and perhaps rediscover that original sound."
5,Excellent Lifetime Movie,"When I first saw previews for Wisegal I knew that I wanted to see it. It had a great cast and a great storyline. Turns out it was better than what I thought it would be. Alyssa Milano gives a great performance throughout the movie and she really ""sells"" her character. If you like Lifetime movies OR Alyssa Milano then I think you'll like this movie.Short Storyline: Patty's (Alyssa Milano) husband dies and she doesn't know how to support her family anymore. She meets a guy who is in the mob which she doesn't know at first. She needs money to support her family so she goes to work for him. Throughout the movie Patty learns more and more about the mob and the guy that she doesn't like until finally she tries to get out. Watch the movie to see if Patty can make it out of the mob...Again I thought this was an excellent movie and the acting was amazing."
5,one of my favs,"Alyssa milano is a classy but tough mother raising two young boys & taking care of her mother after losing her husband & doing what she has to do for her family to survive, this is definitely one of my favorites movies of all time."
3,One very good scene! It was hot! But that was it...,"Basically, this is a very so-so drama about a sexy redheaded female lawyer who goes undercover at a strip club to try and save her client from prison for a murder he didn't commit.It was mostly forgettable, except for one scene where the lawyer is talking with one of the other girls at the strip club. The girl is explaining to her how lap-dances are the best way to make the big bucks, and when the red-haired lady lawyer asks her to explain what exactly a lap-dance entails the pretty stripper says it would be easier to SHOW HER! And so she then gives the female lawyer a very erotic lap-dance! It was NICE!!! The best part of his entire film! In fact, the ONLY good part of this entire film! If it wasn't for that one scene I'd rate this video a one-star as did the other reviewers."
1,Not for the Gabriella Hall fans!!!,"If you are just looking for some nice hot movies with Gabriella Hall in them, like I was, Do Not get this one. Unluckily, she plays the jealous housewife, upon which she gets murdered at the begining of the movie, and has no nude scenes. No wonder she wasn't part of the cover names, she was in the movie, like 2 minutes.Bummer"
5,"Lovely singing, recitation, and arrangements","This is an album worth owning if you are interested in Maori culture and music. Jade Eru's singing is lovely and clear, and the text is always understandable. The recitations are likewise beautiful, and the arrangements are interesting, including Jade E. playing flute. The children's song is especially charming. Wave sounds and traditional instruments complete the mood."
3,Appealing but limited Euro-electronica,"Fair enough debut from experimental pop electro programmer qualifies as worthy background music but rarely rises to the surface. Few, if any tracks can match up to the calculated subtleties and cold mechanized sheen found on Raum Im Ort, Moist's most impressive configuration, but the album's more casual approach will ensure a promising atmospheric integrity throughout. So what it adds up to is a great alternative to typical trance music; nothing spectacular compositionally or technically, but enough competence and variance to provide noticeable distraction."
4,Up/Down/sideways/circular Groove,"I love this Cd! I'm not a big fan of techno/electronic music, but recently I've discovered a few gems. A few on this one aren't me cup o tea (a bit repetitious to the point of annoying) but those points are few and far between. It's kinda like a soundtrack to an eerie horror/suspense thriller in some parts while upbeat & charming in others. It does have a industrial technological electronic feel, but the rythyms bore deep into the 'ol grey matter!"
1,IT STINKS!!!! THE ONLY REASON IT SELLS IS MASE,"Look , dont waste your time with this bad cd . the only reason i like it a little is because it features mase . but if you wanna hear mase buy Mase it is 10 times better and has more cool songs So i guess harlem world should have tried harder because this cd is garbage!!!"
5,A BASSIST WITH REAL TASTE!!!!!!,"today's modern bassist think that you have to slap and tap a billion notes,just to get some recognition. Iam not saying thats bad.In fact it's a great thing. real musicians are always searching for that sound in his or her mind and heart. veasley's playing is effortless and his songs are a great influence on the modern bassist.he shows that the bass can really touch people! In the hands of course. If you call yourself a musician buy this album. You will not regret it. Trust me."
5,This Is Pure Smooth Jazz!,"This album is pure smooth jazz.You can hear it from the first sounds of the funky ""Coup Deville""(my personal favorite song from this cd).It has a kind of nice warm jazz feel to it.""Sarah's Song"" is another warm, light song that is perfect for listening after a hard days work.""Put On Your Sunday Clothes"" is a happy-go-lucky song that I put in the morning and always puts a smile on my face.""Do You Remember?"" show Chris Farr demonstrating his gifted skills to us with his saxophone and Mark Knox does a pretty good job on keyboards as well.Gerald Veasly is a gifted guitar and bass player and I recommend this CD to anyone who is a dieheart jazz fan, this CD is definetely one of my favorites."
2,Cannot ride this one,"There is definitely no ""A Train"" on this CD. Let's Do It Again was the only one that I could really get into. The rest was flat to me. I really enjoy the bass but there was really nothing there. I am the first reviewer, maybe the next one can explain it better. There is no groove are easy listening here. Sorry Gerald."
3,Good book,"It tells all about why we should have natural nutrition for our pets. But, other than the three basic recipies given in the book, it is lacking on more detailed recipies and guidlines. All I got out of the book was just; 'go down to the super market and buy several pounds of raw hamburger meat for your pet.' This book is very similar to another one I recieved called ""Real Dogs Don't Eat Kibble"". I wonder who copied the other?"
1,Not much evidence for this,"Schultze offers no hard, convincing evidence, or argument for her beliefs. It would seem the natural food is better than the junk from the stores. But who knows? Maybe the animals who are doomed to live with man have acclimated to the commercial stuff. I would like to see real and controlled studies to see if there is any significant difference between what this book touts and doggie bisquits. Personal belief and hype just does not cut it."
4,A great starting point,"Having known relativley little on the subject of raw natural diets, I found this book to be an excellent starting point. It is easy to read, consise, to the point, and is very encouraging for the novice. It has a sample monthly menu which I found invaluable when changing my dogs over to the nautral diet. I have since read many books on the subject but I refer back to this book the most. I would have liked more specific information regarding feeding puppies and their specific growing needs."
2,incorrect medical info,"There is some information that is medically incorrect; so we have lost faith in the author's education and do not feel comfortable putting our dog's health in her hands. This writer might have some correct info but she also has some uneducated ideas that she states as fact. On another note, my friend has her dog on this diet, for only a couple weeks now, and he's less itchy ... with out the raw chicken bones... of course ..."
2,Over States Benefits of Natural Diet,"Kymythy Shultze presents the well known concerns surrounding commercial pet food. All of Her conclusions are established from other sources, there is value in books who's information is established via this methodology, but the author overstates what the facts mean to the health of dogs and cats. The information on natural pet diets is a useful introduction to the subject. Pet owners wanting to know what foods and how to prepare them for their animal will find this text straight forward and easy to understand. The problems is Shultze discusses the positive if not curative effects of the books natural diet on cancer, our research at VitaHound on dog nutrition has found while diet is relevant to the prevention and treatment of all types of cancer, it is irresponsible to make claims as strong as this book does."
4,Not as easy as putting kibble in a bowl,"This book has good information and following it will benefit you dog or cat. But, be prepared for a bit more work, more shopping and more money. The author is knowledgable and gives great information to substantiate the diet. It is highly recommended by my dog's breeder. So, I would recommened reading it and then seeing how you can incorporate some or all of it into your dog or cat's diet."
5,Thinking about a natural food diet for your pet?,"If you are, I highly recommend this book. It's written in a easy to read style and is a great introduction on what is needed to successfully implement a raw food diet. This book covers a variety of material, including nutrition aspects, how to make up a meal, how to switch your animal over, and a basic guideline with amounts of various ingredients listed.The book itself is spiral bound, making it easy to set on the counter the first couple of times you try the menu. There are 118 pages, which includes a natural care yellow pages at the end. Included in these pages are a list of books and newsletters to further your understanding.The last chapter of testimonials from various people who have switched their pets over to a raw foods diet are touching and inspirational. This book made it easy for me to understand the benefits and the mechanics of a natural diet, that I've been left wondering why I didn't switch my dog over sooner."
3,"Nice start in the research of the ""barf"" diet","this book is a nice intro to the ultimate diet. the downside to this book is that it does not go into enough detail. also, half of the book is filled with testimonies on how well the diet has worked. i would like to see more scientific proof, as well as common sense recipes/ways to feed your pet the barf diet."
3,Good starting point,"This is an easy and fast read. I found it incredibly interesting and a great starting point to putting my cats on a raw food diet. Unfortunately, this book left me with more questions than answers. There is no index so trying to find something again is a bit of a challenge. I recommend it for anyone thinking about going raw."
4,Great,Informative and very interesting and it all makes sense and great to be feeding a natural diet to my dogs
5,Good Start!,"This was a great basic book to start a ""feeding only raw"" regiment for our puppy. Every pet owner should read this book."
4,"great album, now on cd","This album was really well promoted when it was released, in 1978 on both sides of the atlantic it shows a sensitive side to the wild one.The album had 3 singles released from it Don't change my luck, If you can't give me love and The race is on. All singles have a great sound. Also Stumblin in (duet with Chris Norman was released for the U S market, Suzi's biggest hit to date in the USA.This cd comes in a well presented box, and is a worth while listen the album tracks such as breakdown and wiser than you are single material.Not digitally remastered unfortunately but still a worth while buy."
4,"Great doll, both in concept and execution","Mary Jo Gardener is super cute and super fun! She's got buttons and a zipper on her overalls (neither of which is that difficult for a child to manipulate, contrary to a previous review). One shoe has a snap strap; the other shoe has a Velcro strap. The flower on her hat attaches with Velcro, and her hair and hat (which is an integrated part of the doll and does not come off) have ribbon ties. The ribbons are sewn on so they can't get lost or swallowed by a curious toddler. The overalls come off and are therefore washable; the shirt might be a squeeze, but it's probably doable. (She doesn't have any undies.) Her hat brim, buttons, zipper pocket, and shoes are more of a hot pink than the purple-y magenta shade they appear to be in the photo. She's very soft and snuggly for a little one to hold. My niece can't put her down!"
5,Very Cute Doll,"I purchased this doll for my Mom. She has Alzheimer's and is very hyper and fidgets all time. I thought this would keep her busy. It worked, not only does it keep her busy it calms her down. It's very durable. Everyone wants to touch it, it's so cute. I'm very happy with the doll."
4,Flower comes off hat,"Bought this for my granddaughter, she loves it. Word of warning however -- the flower on the hat is only velcro'ed on and comes off easily. It could present a choking hazard if your child still puts things in her mouth. Mine does; the flower has been permanently removed."
5,Mom of 3,"I purchased this doll for my 15 month old for Christmas so she hasnt had the opportunity to play with it yet. But based on what I have seen with the doll, it is excellent quality and meets the needs I was searching for. My daughter is my third child and I know how important it is for children to learn these skills and think she will have lots of fun learning!"
2,Pick another,I purchased this doll for my one-year-old thinking that she could begin to work on her dexterity. In the on-line photo the doll is cute but when I got her I was vey disappointed. Not only is she not appealing but I probably could have made something better myself on my sewing machine. The snaps and buttons are difficult for even an adult. I will be returning this. My older daughter got a similar doll when she was one. We found it at Younkers and she is much cuter and more user friendly. I tried to find that one again but no luck so I settled. Poor choice.
2,Very Weak Text,"This text provides little new information on the art and skill of social work supervision, which makes sense since it is only 146 pages long. Spend the extra $10 and buy the 4th edition of Supervision in Social Work by the masters...Kadushin & Harkness."
5,We All Live in A Capital I (and other classics included as bonus features),"I just suggested this to another parent, and when I saw the reviews had to add that I think its excellent. My 17 month old loves this video and I do as well. Lots of well known artists reworking their hits around the letters in the alphabet, but the really fabulous part is the classics included as a bonus. Parents may remember the wanted M who tries to mascarade as a W to avoid the fuzz, the zippy, zippy zing, zing Z, Darling daughter (do daisies have feet? ducks do have ears but they don't do the dishes), and the aforementioned we all live in a capital I song.Steven Colbert is hilarious as the depressive, angsty letter Z. This is an all around great dvd."
2,Colbert is the Letter Z... Always thought of him as a DB,"Colbert, middle-aged and struggling, before his big break with John Stewart, finds himself as the comic relief as the letter Z in this mall trip through the alphabet. Now he is testifying before congress and considering a run for president. His shtick wears thin in this as it does in his Comedy Central program. The kids don't find him and and for good reason... he sucks. Satire shouldn't be beaten to death by a one trick pony."
3,Singing is Great...the Actors Aren't,"One of the things I love about the Sesame Street DVDs are the songs and the liveliness of the characters. This video starts off REALLY boring with the A and Z walking around the mall talking to people about the letters. My son wants to see characters and singing. The parts with the Sesame Street gang and the songs are fun, but the rest is boring. He lost attentinon with this video and normally he is enraptured by Sesame Street videos. I might have to try another alphabet DVD."
5,My guys love it . . .,"I was also surprised by the poor reviews - both my two year old and one year old are riveted, which is fortunate as it's one of the only children's videos that doesn't make me want to gouge out my own eardrums. I will say that for actually learning the alphabet I think the Leapfrog Letter Factory is better, but there again you have the super annoying Professor Quigely - who I must say is no Stephen Colbert."
4,I thought it was great - surprised at poor reviews,"My kids are only 6 months old and this video holds their attention more than Baby Einstein and other dvds. I'm surprised at the poor reviews, but all kids are different and don't like the same things..."
5,It's a winner!!!!!,I ordered the DVD after a visit to see family and my baby really liked it. She now watches it at least two times a day and just can't get enough of it. She still can't talk but can sing along with the tunes to all the songs and the alphabet song. It's a huge hit in our house.
4,Good Product,I got this as a gift for my boyfriend and he just loves it! He has now put it as the guardian to his man cave!
5,new technology paper towel dispenser,"I have never seen such a high quality paper towel holder, or one that is a rachet drive. It is easy to tear off any amount of paper towel with one hand."
3,Mr. Generosity,"A novel, that would today be considered sappy (and even laughable), The Man of Feeling reminds us of the quinesstential purpose of all human beings, to help one another. The main character, Mr. Harley, is more then willing to share his wealth with everyone who asks. His benevolence (to the point of his own bankruptcy) gains him the reputation as Mr. Generosity. In the end, he dies because his heart cannot contain his happiness. As an uplifting change of pace, I recommend this book to all those who have lost faith in humanity. But, if your looking for an action packed thriller, try another book.:)"
5,Superb Recording,"This is by far the most outstanding Pagliacci recording I have ever heard. A young Domingo offers a beautifully sung and dramatically intense Canio. Caballe pairs well with Domingo here, and while her Nedda is a little limp dramatically the singing is gorgeous. I can't say enough about Sherrill Milnes' Tonio. This role provides a good vehicle for his gorgeous dramatic baritone (you must hear the prologue). The only drawback is a stagnat and limp chorus, which in this opera, where the chorus is present so much, leaves rather a pointed whole in this great recording."
4,"Domingo is caught at his youthful best, but the conducting is second-rate","I can see that every other reviewer here has praised this Pagliacci without reservation. I certainly share that feeling so far as Domingo goes. He made a contemporary Cavelleria rusticana that displayed his total involvement in verismo style, and over the years he has returned to the role of Canio often. His voice is glemaing and passionate, his intensity undeniable. If that were all a complete opera recording needs this would easily be a great recording. But despite the fine cast, Caballe isn't earthy enough or strong enough in her chest tones to make Nedda feel completely right fro her (Callas gave a lesson is how the role should be sung), and the veteran Met conductor Nello Santi offers little excitment or passion. It's too bad that James Levine and Renata Scotto, who helped make the Cavalleria reccording such a huge success, didn't come back for this Pagliacci."
4,Good ol' Texas Gulf Coast Rock!,"DITTO THE OTHER REVIEWS. Eric D. rocks steady. Leesa S. on drums makes the guys say ""god damn... she's good!"" Chris King plays faultlessly whilst chainsmoking. Carolyn sings rock, blues, country, whatever-- it ALL sounds good. Getting handy on guitar too. See them live. Til then get the CD."
3,Carolyn and her band play good ol' texas blues-rock.,"A decent outing for Carolyn and her band.Listen to the last track-""Stay""-and you will be convinced of this young Texas gals' amazing voice.Listen to her about 45-50 seconds into ""Stay"" and you'll be converted.All this from a 5'2"" 115 lbs. twenty-something!Drummer Leesa Harrington and bassist Chris King provide a rock solid rhythm section.Guitarist Eric Dane plays well but seems a little buried in the mix-the recording is too bassy.This band can do better but a solid effort nonetheless from these young Texan road-warriors.Check out their ""Play With Matches"" or ""Groove Milk"" CDs'-both more representative of the band.Also, no reason the second track ""Harmonicar"" isn't on the radio-its'catchy,fun rock n' roll.This young band is going places;listen and find out why."
3,This is a gift for my Japanese friend.,He was so glad when I presented this CD to my friend. My friend was so happy!
4,Cleans well,This is the fourth rug cleaner that I have owned & the third Hoover. I like the Hoover. The brushes do a good job of loosening the dirt and it has plenty of suction. My experience is that the brushes eventually stop working. You can extend the life by storing the unit with the tanks separate. Water from the tanks seems to corrode the unit and make it wear out faster. The convenience of having a unit at home makes owning one of these worthwhile & the price was right.
5,Love the Midsomer,"I love Midsomer Murders and look forward to each set. Now that I know that John Nettles is going to be gone within the next few sets, I love them even more. Grisly murders somehow manage to overwhelm these little villages, and there is always a new twist. The family, the drama, the theatre, the scenery. It is all wonderful. Each story is more wonderful than the next, and there are always surprises, so stay tuned."
3,they are just ok,"Not too pleased with the last two sets. story lines are getting off track with what we like with the ""midsomer"" style. too bad. we probably won't be buying again."
5,"Modern, Moral, Intelligent, Intrigueing, Enjoyable, Beautiful","Have been great fans of all the Masterpiece Mysteries since it all became available during the early to mid 1980's. Midsomer, Lynley, Marple, Maigret, Poirot, Frost, and of course Sherlock. These and expecially Midsomer give the viewer all of what is best and can be admired in good drama. And without the unnecessary Sex, Grafic Violence, Cruelty, and Vulgar Language.Anyone old or young would enjoy these programs."
5,As good as ever,"I have watched the ""Midsomer"" series from the very beginning and have seen it go through various changes and some growing pains. The most recent installment (at least on this side of the Atlantic) has four new episodes, nicely subtitled for those who can not always make out the dialogue through music and assorted noise, and offers the usual mixture of suspense, dry wit and quirky British small-town atmosphere. John Nettles and his crew are as good as ever. There is some occasional blurring in the picture when people are in motion. Perhaps a sign of less than careful camera work? The scripts are also somewhat uneven, as can be expected with any series. Regardless, I would not miss it for anything."
5,I'M ONE OF THE OLDER PEOPLE,"In response to ""Older People"", thank God for an intelligent, thought provoking, character building show! I am so sick and tired of shootouts, car chases, extreme violence, gratuitous sex and stories with no substance. Midsomer Murders does not have all these things, just good story lines, excellent character development and real actors. And as far as being ""Cute"", what planet do you come from? I am a huge mystery buff and own all the Frost, Morse, Inspector Lindley, Miss Marple, Piroit, Rough Diamond (another gem) and Sherlock Holmes DVD's and Midsomer Murders is right up there with these oustanding, well developed shows. I'm an American and let me tell you, I would rather watch all of the above shows than all the crap (with the exception of NCIS)that is on American TV. Thank God for British mysteries."
5,A History of My Memphis..,"As a native Memphian and having been born just shortly before Mr Crump left this Earth; I read this book as a history of the Memphis I grew up in and still love. The stories are so well done, Mr Branston is an exceptional writer. He is never mean about his subjects, you get a feel for the humanity of all the players. Read this book."
3,Zipper was stuck!,Zippity Boy is cute but the one I received had fabric glued so close to the zipper I ended up cutting it away and having to sew the edges closed. I would have sent it back but it came 2 weeks late and there wasn't time.
4,Well made and adorable,Cute....perfect for your boy. Well made.My eight year old still likes it. Very cute indeed. You wont regret this purchase.
2,poor quality,The doll was unstitched all the way down the back of it with stuffing coming out. I didnt want to go through the hassle of returning it so I sewed it up myself. Wasnt worth the money I spent on it. Should have cost about 10 dollars instead of 20. very dissapointed!
1,NOT that impressed,I thought you could dress and undress him too for learning... not the case and his air is ORANGE and not like poto CHEAPLY MADE. My son wont touch it. :-(
1,cute but unusable,"Although this doll is cute, it cannot be of any use in teaching a toddler how to dress. The zipper os of poor quality and will only go up half way because the entire jacket is way too small. The button holes are against the doll and the buttons on top--much too awkward to use. The shoelace is made of very slippery material and will not hold a tie at all. The snap on the hat works but requires more strength than a toddler has."
5,cool and jazzy,Very nice toe tapping jazz. I especially liked the renditions of inner city blues and heart of gold. Carla's great voice and scat singing style combined with good jazz and a hint of violin make for a happy listener...
4,wow - very thorough,"this book seems exhaustive - there is a lot of detail and i use it a lot to get around Japan. no guide book is perfect, but this is my favorite for Japan."
3,Just OK,This book definitely has a lot of info in it. I took it to Tokyo and Kyoto with me. It would have been nice if it had walking tours like some other guides have because otherwise it's hard to know where you're at when you're trying to read lines and lines of text.More pics would be nice as well. I like to get a visual sense of where I'm going to be at before I decide whether or not I want to go there.
2,this book is a mistake,I'd say that I'm an experienced traveller and this is one of the worst tavel books I've ever experienced. A lot of wrong information. Too heavy on accomodations/where to eat and not enough cultural info. and background on festival which Japan is famous for.
3,detailed yet confounding,read carefully... there is is good info in there somewhere... other wise you will end up wandering the red light district of hiroshima for a bar that does not exist
3,"skimpy maps, poorly indexed","This book is not marred by the ""where can an English-only speaker find a good place to get drunk and party"" spirit of the Lonely Planet guide. Sadly, however, it falls short of the Lonely Planet in the crucial departments of maps and index. If you're in a rental car the fact that the Rough Guide maps don't show route numbers will be a painful discovery. For train travelers, the book would be a lot more useful if the index were more comprehensive."
3,Don't buy on kindle!,"This is a good general guide for Japan, but don't get the Kindle download! The maps and images are unrecognizable and the publishers are so afraid that you will copy them that they don't give you a size you can even read!What good is a travel book without maps??"
1,The kindle version sorely needs a graphical upgrade,"I was really excited to get this travel guide from the preview, but upon purchase I am sorely disappointed. The layout of the ebook is great, the links are intuitive, and the look of the book is generally pleasing. BUT the maps are completely unreadable. I am using the ipad2 version of Kindle and aside from seeing the lines of roads and train lines on the map images, you cannot read most of the text on the maps. How can you release a book when it's illegible?So let this warning to any future buyers; all the reviews i saw were for the paperback version, not the kindle version. I find this to be completely unacceptable for the price I paid. I'm really not sure how this can be considered a travel guide when you clearly can't use the maps for guidance. Please at least update the graphics to something readable, not some low grade 5k image of an important map."
3,not so hot,"i used this guide on a recent two week trip in japan. although it is packed with practical information, inaccuracies are common. maps were terrible and some reviews unreliable. it's a first edition so i would recommend lonely planet until they get this one up to snuff."
1,Not useful,"Filled with inaccurate information, lack of good, accurate maps. It was almost completely useless. Never again I will buy another Rough Guide. Long live Lonely Planet."
4,Great product,I have had the same Avent bottles for three kids. I do have a problem with the rings falling on the heater part of dishwasher. These were delivered to me in less than 5 days regular shipping....amazing
5,Avent Accessories,"I give 5 stars to all Avent Products. I have had no problems, whatsoever, with Avent."
2,not very helpful,"This book is for those already very familiar with thermodynamics and the multi variable calculus used in it. It would make a nice supplement to a textbook, but should not be used as the text itself (as was in my case) because it is not in depth and not particularly reader friendly."
3,Outdated?,"Page 4: ""A transformation is said to be reversible when the successive states of the transformation differ by infinitesimal from equilibrium states"".It is not enough to the transformation be reversible. For example, see just the title of:""Thermodynamics of an Irreversible Quasi-Static Process"", de John S. Thomsen, American Journal of Physics, 28, 119, 1960.Page 25: ""A transformation of a thermodynamical system is said to be adiabatic if it is reversible and if the system is thermally insulated so that no heat can be exchanged between it and its environment during the transformation.""It is not necessary to be reversible to be adiabatic.The transformation that is adiabatic and reversible is called isentropic.I didn't read the next pages to find more errors."
4,Clear and concise,"A good, concise treatment of the topic. Very readable... The text comes across in lecture style, leading the reader from first principles through the basics of thermo, on to the more advanced concepts."
5,Clear and Concise,"First published in 1937, this book is a masterful treatment by a master physicist. Weighing in at just over 150 pages, it manages to cover all the really essential topics in this subject. Furthermore there are a few excellent examples that nicely illustrate the power of thermodynamic methods. The treatment and use of free energy are notable high points in this work.Sadly, this book is probably still not appropriate for readers who have no knowledge of thermodynamics or the physics of heat more generally, but it would make an ideal second book on the subject. However, The Feynman Lectures are enough to make this book accessible.The chapter titles give a good idea of the contents:1) Thermodynamic Systems2) The First Law of Thermodynamics3) The Second Law of Thermodynamics4) The Entropy5) Thermodynamic Potentials6) Gaseous Reactions7) Thermodynamics of Dilute Solutions8) The Entropy Constant"
5,genius and simplicity: an ageless masterpiece,"This is Fermi at his best. A charming booklet which presents thermodynamics using the elegant Carnot cycle method. It stands out from the competitors by showing many enlightening applications with physics always having the limelight. The study of the adiabatic atmosphere, with the derivation of the dependence of temperature on height,is particularly delightful."
2,"Good graciousness, string path integral ?","Vector Operator Algerba and string path integrals simply do not mix. When you take into consideration of rings, fields, lattices, everything becomes a nightmarish problem of topography that no one can solve. Inviting strings into it is like linear transformation without lines. Two stars for creative title."
2,Not very helpful,This DVD was a waste of money for me. It's too advanced for beginners because it expects you to know basic chords. On the other hand it does virtually nothing to advance the intermediate player. It focuses primarily on alternate base methods with a brief intro to melody. For the same amount of money there are other beginners and/or intermediate instruction videos available that cover a lot more than this does. Not recommended.
1,It wasn't described as being on display for 16 years,Upon reading the discription no where did it say the item was on display for 16 yrs. It was for a collector of barbie and to be given as a gift. The box cover was worn and discolored. I knew it was from 1996 but thought it was clearfully preserved. I was going to send it back for credit but only kept it cause I didn't want a hassel. I ended up opening the doll and giving it to my wife for her collection losing it's collector value by opening it. I definetly will be more cautious upon future purchases from amazon and not happy with the whole transaction
4,Second album...pretty good,"The Girls' second effort, their follow-up to their self titled debut, is pretty good. It released a couple of good singles; R.U Sexin' Me? and Pure (You're Touching Me). Camille Henderson (also known as Sara McLachlan's back-up singer, and played character Shirley in ""My American Cousin"") and Silvana Petrozzi, replaced with Janele Woodley and Celia-Louise Martin are joined with original band member Aimee McKenzie for this album. AWESOME Canadian talent!! My personal favorite track is the Ritchie Valens cover of ""We Belong Together"". Sadly, this was their last album. Liked the first album better, but this was also a great album from that time."
3,Textbook Review,I found the book to be very helpful for completing a course in curriculum and instruction. The book provided me with excellent activities and situations to contemplate. It also had an excellent chapter for administrators who are seen as curriculum and instructional leaders in their schools.
3,Curriculum Improvement,"Curriculum Improvement gives a wealth of information for beginning teachers. I found the book to be difficult to read as there was so much information and it is so technical that I could not follow every aspect. The book, however can be a great resource."
2,Curriculum Improvement Needs Improvement,"The textbook Curriculum Improvement. Decision Making Process by Ronald C. Doll (1996) is hard to read. I found many of the analogies used throughout the book improper and inappropriate. I had to read over paragraphs several times before I finally understood the point Mr. Doll was trying to make. This book is not appropriate for a 6-week graduate level course taken over the Internet. If this were used in a classroom setting, students would have opportunities to discuss the book with fellow classmates and the instructor. Mr. Doll does however, do a thorough job in examining the subject of curriculum improvement."
4,Curriculum Improvement: Decision Making and Process,I found this book to be well written and very informative. It is a good book for someone who is interested in curriculum improvement.
4,Curriculum Improvement,The Curriculum Improvement: Decision Making and Process (9th ed.) by Ronald C. Doll was a very thorough book. It discussed concepts and ideas about curriculum development in depth. The book is a valuable resource for information. Each chapter contained activities that clarified the information in the chapter. The chapters were lengthy and many times had to be read in separate sessions.
4,Great Reference Tool,"Ronald C. Doll's text, Curriculum Improvement, Decision Making and Process, 9th Edition, was easy to read, and well organized. The detail present in the table of contents was a great asset during my studies. I imagine that I will probably use this text again as a reference tool."
4,A Reference Book,"I must be honest the book was used as a reference. I referred to the book when I needed some explaination of a concept or a process. However, I did not use the book extensively. Curriculum Planning by Doll is great for the student who has little to no experience with curriculum and design. It is also a wonderful history book, detailing the history of curriculum design and it's progression through the years. As stated before it is a good reference book. Once again, this text was a wonderful reference and I do recommedend it for that use."
4,Curriculum Improvement Review,This book was very informative and full of examples. I especially liked the participation section that discusses the role of the environment in planning curriculum.
4,A Students Review,"Curriculum Improvement by Ronald C. Doll is an outstanding ""How to"" guide for creating and/or improving your schools curriculum. Although I am for the most part, unfamiliar with much of the civilian lexicon of educational terms, Doll did a good job in explaining most of the terms he used. Although incorporating a glossary would have made it easier for me to research the meaning of some of his text, all of his technical terms were easily found in a good dictionary. The procedures Doll outlined for the creation/improvement of curriculum were easy to follow, and the sequence the steps were presented in made sense. Although I don't have much experience with texts covering this topic, I believe it is a good resource, and more than adequate for use by anyone who desires to improve themselves in the area of curriculum improvement."
2,A good reference,"Wow. This book was really tough for me to read. I had to break the readingassignments into sessions in order to finish! Chapter 1 was a bit too long andunneccessary for the history of curriculum. It is well founded that historical perspectivesare important to the ever-changing curriculum. However, I am not sure that a historicaltimeline of events is really necessary. It seems common sense that schools will changeand adapt to society's needs at the given moment. I feel about the same way inreference to the philosophy chapter. I did find Chapter 5 and 6 to be very useful toexplain how the curriculum design and evaluation processes actually occur. Chapters 7-9were also informative, but very lengthy to make a point that required much less."
3,NOVA student - Eric,"The Curriculum Development book by Ronald C. Doll had much valuable information to offer. Some of the topics in it include Psychological Bases for Curriculum Decisions and the General Process of Curriculum Change. Reading this textbook can be a bit difficult due to lengthy, wordy chapters. Although I found some topics helpful in my own classroom setting, I probably will not keep this book in my personal library."
3,Elementary P.E. Teacher,"This book was required for one of my graduate level classes. It provides the reader with much information concerning curriculum, such as influences on curriculum and the design and implementation of curriculum. Although the book is not easy reading, the author does a good job of providing important information on all aspects of curriculum."
2,Textbook Critique,"This book, Curriculum Improvement: Decision Making and Process, by Ronald C. Doll (1996) was not very interesting for me, and did not do much to keep my attention. It was a struggle for me to get through each chapter, and as a result, I have no interest in the curriculum development process. The book did have very interesting questions and activities at the end of each chapter, which I found were suitable for those persons going into the administrative part of education."
4,Review of Textbook - CIT 501,I found the text to be very easy to read. I gained a wealth of knowledge for my course in this publication.
4,Doll textbook review,"The text by Doll outlines each step for establishing a successful curriculum. The text examines numerous aspects of curriculum design, political influences, cultural influences, selection of subject matter, planning process and numerous other areas of curriculum design."
4,Good Reference Book,Review of Curriculum Improvement Decision Making and Process Ninth Edition by Ronald C. DollThis is a good reference book for definitions and practical applications of curriculum terminology. It has been updated to encompass new presidential guidelines for the improvement and implementation of ideas and goals for this era.
3,Curriculum Improvement,The Curriculum Improvement book is full of usefulinformation. The organization of the book could havebeen better as tget tried to put too much information ineach chapter.
3,Curriculum Improvement,The Curriculum Improvement book is full of useful information. The organization of the book could have been better as tget tried to put too much information in each chapter.
3,Health Education Teacher - NW Chicago,"This textbook provides the educator with an understanding of the fundamental issues, problems, and concerns in curriculum planning. This first part of the text discusses the psychological, social and cultural influences on curriculum. The latter part pertains to the process of improving the curriculum. I found this textbook to be very thorough, but at times very difficult to work my way through. If you have a specific interest in curriculum improvement you may find sections of this book helpful."
3,Curriculum Improvement,"Two texts were required for Curriculum and Instruction-CIT 501 through Nova Southeastern Univerisity's online Master's in Education program.Doll, R. C. (1996). Curriculum Improvement. Upper Saddle River, NJ: PearsonEducation.This textbook was a standard college text focusing on the process of curriculum work in schools and the decisions that are associated with it. Information was presented in a clear, although somewhat dry, format. Chapters were well organized and fairly lengthy. The text served its purpose for meeting course objectives."
3,Curriculum Improvement,"Curriculum Improvement: Decision making and Process by Ronald C. DollThis textbook was required reading for a class that I took on Curriculum and Instruction through Nova Southeastern University. Having never taken a class in curriculum design before, I found the text very thorough on the topic giving historical background, psychological basis and social factors as they influence curriculum design. The text is not light reading, but many valid points are raised and the book is well laid out for easy referencing. Some of the information is a bit dated, written when the first President Bush was in the White House. If you, your school, and your school board are thinking of redesigning your curriculum, take a look at this book for ideas."
2,Curriculum,"I found this book rather wordy which made it difficult to quickly access specific information. However, it was sufficient for the course requirements. I do not plan to keep this book in my professional library."
4,Review,"This text is a typical education textbook, full of good material for use as a reference, butnot a text that one is tempted to read from cover to cover. I found it useful when lookingfor ideas in the writing of papers and for reference for discussions."
4,Curriculum Improvement: Decision Making and Process,"The ""Curriculum Improvement: Decision Making and Process""text by Doll, was insightful. It clarifies the differentaspects of curriculum such as the developemental stages in lifeand cultural issues effecting development. Doll discusses what you should keep in mind as you write a curriculum."
3,Doll Review,"This text contains the historical perspective of curriculum development as well as the process of designing and implementing a curriculum. The information is applicable to current educational settings and the author provides numerous situational problems, thus allowing the reader to apply concepts throughout the text. Although this text provides useful information, the format of the text is not particularly reader friendly. The length of the chapters and lack of related illustrations made it difficult for this reader to maintain an appropriate attention span."
2,Evaluation,I found the book to be easy to understand and useful. The issues covered reflects the necessary issues facing our schools today.
4,Excellent Book,The Curriculum Planning by Doll provided detailed information pertaining to curriculum development. It allowed me to gain a better insight on the process of planning a curriculum.
3,Excellent Resource,"It is a very informative resource. I feel the book was extremely organized. Although the chapters are lengthy, it provides a well planned and thought process for all curriculum concerns. I specifically like the chapter which covers objectives in the curriculum. This chapter provides specific details of all types of objectives and correlates with the thematic unit."
3,Undergrad Aimed,"The book seemed like it was aimed toward an undergrad curriculum student. It is well written, however it can get quite ordinary at times."
4,CIT 505 assignment book review,"This book was well written and easy to understand. It took you through the steps in curriculum development from the history of curriculum, the current trends in curriculum, and how to create your own curriculum (or what you need to develop that curriculum). The book provided several examples to clarify what ideas were being discussed and made the ideas easy to grasp."
3,Fairly Good Reading,The text was fairly good reading. Many of the points and ideas were interesting but not fabulous. I found the other assigned textbook to more helpful and informative. I feel I really could have completed the course without it.
3,Curriculum Improvement: Decision Making and Process by Doll,"This text is a good resource for designing or improving the school curriculum. However, I found that the information in the chapters could have possibly been condensed to form a shorter textbook. The price is also too expensive."
4,Helpful and Informative...,"This text is full of helpful information, which I used in my Master's program. Chapters are structured and logical, the writing is clear and easy to follow. One of the most helpful items in the book are the inclusion of ""situations"" that provide true-to-life examples. These ""situations"" along with the chapter questions allow the reader an in-depth study and understanding of the material. I would recommend this text for anyone interested in improving their curriculum in the classroom or searching for fresh ideas."
3,DOLL CRITIQUE,"THE BOOK WAS OKAY. IT DIDN'T KEEP ME INTERESTED IN CURRICULUM. I DID, HOWEVER, LIKE THE SUMMARIES AT THE END OF EACH CHAPTER. SOMETIMES READING THE SUMMARY TELLS IF THE CHAPTER IS INTERESTING. I ALSO LIKED THE STUDY QUESTIONS. I KNOW THAT IF I WAS ABLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS, I HAD A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE CHAPTER."
3,A Learning Experience,"The text was a great resource during this term. I have learned countless things from the use of this resource. I am even planning to do some restructuring of my class over the summer and based on what I have learned and read from the text.As an English major with no education courses, the reasoning and logic behind curriculum development was not always clear. Doll's test helped me to understand the necessity of it.The Doll text was a little difficult to follow and took a lot more time to read because it was almost too detailed, although it was very informative. I have highlighted information I plan to go back to so that I can fully digest it.I have learned many valuable things that I plan to use to take my students to another level.Corie Thomas"
4,Curriculum Improvement,I took an online course and this was one of the required books. This was a great book. It was very imformative and beneficial. It provided very interesting and helpful information.
3,Curriculum Improvement,Curriculum Improvement is a textbook that contains a wealth of information. It's not a book that gives practical advice that pertains to the classroom.
3,Review,"Curriculum Improvement by R. Doll has some great information, but overall I found the text difficult to follow. As a preservice teacher, some of the information in the text was a bit overwhelming. I found myself having to re-read parts in order to gain a better understanding."
3,Curriculum Improvement Decision Making and Process,"This text was difficult to use. The information needed was available, but you had to sort through it to find it. It will make a good reference book and I plan to keep it, but if revised it should be made more user friendly. For this course, with most of the students working full time, vital information at your finger tips and not having to sift through non-essential information is a priority because of time."
2,review of Curriclum Improvement,"I found the book Curriculum Improvement by Ronald C. Doll to be a very useful resource. This book included current, accurate information concerning all areas of curriculum. However, it was incredibly detailed and had so much information that at times it was difficult to sift through to obtain the necessary information."
2,Curriculum Improvement needs improvement,"The text, Curriculum Improvement, by Ronald Doll, is very technically factual. It provides the most recent statistics and trends in education. However, the book is a bit much for practical application. Some of the chapters are helpful in curriculum planning, but most of them are too detailed for ""leisure time"" reading. For the purpose of the curriculum planning course, the text provides accurate, in depth coverage of every aspect of curriculum planning and implementation. This text, overall, gets 2 stars!"
4,A Book You'll Actually Use In Class!,"Curriculum Improvement by Ronald C. Doll was a well-written textbook in that it was easy enough to understand and was applicable to my course and its assignments. It was a bit dry at times, but it didn't put me to sleep either. Included in the text was the following material: Historical & Philosophical Foundations of Curriculum Decision Making; Psychological Bases for Curriculum Decisions; Social & Cultural Forces Affecting Curriculum Decisions; Subject Matter & its Role in Decision Making; Making Decisions about the Design of Curriculum; Evaluation of Curriculum Programs & Projects; Process in Curriculum Improvement; The Planning Process; Participants & their Roles in Curriculum; the Problem of Communication; and Curriculum Leadership."
4,Curriculum Improvement: Decision Making and Process (9th Edi,This is a well-written text. It was very well organized. It is an excellent resource for teachers and schools that want to improve curriculum.
4,Curriculum Improvement: Decision Making and Process,"The textbook written by Doll, Ronald C. curriculum Improvement: Decision making and process I found to be very informative. It was important to me how the book took me through the stages of curriculum development making the language easy to comprehend. The numerous examples and activities enable the reader to understand strategies and procedures in curriculum not only in the classroom but also in general. The book is a great asset to anyone planning on teaching, already teaching or interested in an administrative position or otherwise."
4,Evaluation of Textbooks,"There are definite pros and cons to the textbook entitled Curriculum Improvement: Decision Making and Process. On the affirmative side, the textbook is comprehensive and current. The research supporting the books' information is extensive. On the negative side, this writer feels there is too much text on each page and the 'figures' are very weak. There is no glossary and a feeble index. Also, the 'activities' are useless to me. Perhaps some suggested solutions to the activity sections would have been helpful."
3,Curriculum Planning,"Curriculum Planning by Doll was full of helpful information when completing my graduate work for this semester. At times it was a little difficult to read, but for the most part it was very useful."
2,Curriculum Improvement: Decision Making a Process by Doll,"Curriculum Improvement: Decision Making a Process by DollI found this book a little dry at times. The reading is very heavy and monotonous, especially in the chapters that dealt with the various historical and philosophical curriculum foundations. I have used this book in two different graduate courses at two different universities in two different states and l just hope that I never have to use it again."
4,Doll Review,The text is very user friendly and was quite helpful in completing assignments. It gave ample views on the many aspects of curriculum. Great text to keep for future reference.
5,Curriculum Improvement: Decision Making and Process (9th Edi,"Curriculum Improvement: Decision Making and Process, by Ronald C. Doll thoroughly covers all aspects of curriculum design. Although, the text is geared more towards individuals planning to specialize in curriculum design, it does give the novice curriculum planner a basis in which to plan design and implement curriculum in a thoughtful and meaningful manner. Whether one is a novice or a specialist attempting to plan and design curriculum, I would highly recommend this text as a starting point for this endeavor."
4,The Foundation for Instruction,"In the dedication to Ronald Doll's book, he acknowledges his wife's influence in his writing career. I think his belief that she influenced his successful efforts provides a parallel between curriculum and education. A strong curriculum is to a school as a supportive spouse is to a writer, it is the foundation upon which learning occurs. A weak, narrowly defined, poorly implemented curriculum will not support the educational framework built upon it. His book detailing the historical, philosophical, psychological, social and cultural influences on curriculum helps us understand current issues facing educator, and after providing this background he walks us through the process of improving education. I think his book provides a guide for students interested in improving education."
4,Curriculum Improvement: Decision Making and Process,Overall the text provided good insight to the curriculum design process. The chapters tended to be a bit lengthy.
3,Curriculum Improvement,"In reviewing Doll's Curriculum Improvement, I felt the text had many interesting fact as read in chapter one dealing with history. I did think the text's chapters were too long and too much information to process. I felt as if I needed to take notes on each chapter to remember all the details. Doll's text is well organized but kind of dry with the presentation of information. Some chapters, I found myself counting pages until the end."
4,great info.,"Curriculum planning by Doll gives an indepth account of how to plan an effective curriculum, as well as how to implement it. This book is useful for teachers, administrators and the like. Vivian B. Rodriguez"
3,Good reference book...,"The Doll textbook was helpful in the historical aspects of curriculum. I feel that it wouldbe a helpful reference to see where curriculum has come from. On a scale of 1 - 10, Iwould give it a 6."
3,Bradley Collins,The Doll text has a lot of information on curriculum planning with some drawbacks. The text a times is very wordy which requires the reader to reread sections for understanding. I feel some sections could have given more information for easier understanding for the reader.
3,Review,I found this book to be somewhat helpful. It did provide good examples of how to design a curriculum but was sometimes too wordy. I would not use this book exclusively but it was a good guide.
4,full of information,"The text Curriculum Improvement: Decision Making and Process by Ronald Doll (1996) provides detailed information in a clear-cut, consise format. The book is user friendly, providing good resource suggestions, follow up activites, and examples."
4,curriculum improvement,"Discussion 6I found the curriculum design book to be a very interesting and excellent book to read. It is a very well written book. The only thing I would wish for would be to use a more current text. So much information changes in the world of education. A book that is even two years old is out dated in this day and age. The other book on thematic teaching is alright and most likely great for K-12 teachers, but does not seem to be very useful to me at the college level."
4,Excellent Thematic Text,"This is a wonderful book to assist in writing thematic units. It gives great examples, is easy to read, and is user friendly."
4,Informative but a Challenge to Read,"This text provides a wealth of knowledge on curriculum development, evaluation, and improvement. The information presented was very relevant and complete in regard to subject matter. The only criticism I have is that it often became difficult follow, and many times I needed to review sections to grasp the full meaning."
1,Never Received,"Hi I am sorry that I have nothing good to say, but I never received the book. To this day I have yet to receive a book from anyone. The semester is over and I never got a book.Mitre"
3,Great warranty service,"My bowls arrived, and I placed them for a quick wash in the dishwasher. The 2 qt bowl came out with giant cracks through the bottom. I emailed World Kitchen and they replaced the whole set immediately.I think the bowls are fantastic value but I gave it 3 star because of the initial bowl cracking incident."
3,Pretty but arrived broken and heavier than expected,I purchased this item in June and it arrived with two broken bowls. I contacted amazon to send it back and have another sent out. I guess my disappointment would be more with the manufacturer for not packaging it for shipment because Amazon did fulfill their end of the purchase by shipping a new item to me at no cost and they did not make me send the broken pieces back (due to safety issues they stated).My only complaint about the product itself is that they are very heavy. I expected something a little thinner due to the Corningware/Corelle style of dishes.
4,Shannon Lee Shines,"This movie is definitely worth viewing and the sole reason is Shannon Lee. She does a great job all around and the potential she possesses is instantly noticeable. It's a shame she is not offered more mainstream roles.The only downside to this film is when Shannon is not in a particular scene and that definitely means a lot. She saves this movie from being a complete failure.Overall I highly recommend this picture, although it's not a masterpiece (far from it) it's a stepping stone for Shannon to expand her career and move onto bigger and better things."
5,Shannon Lee is the only reason to see this movie!,The five stars are all for Shannon Lee. She is absolutely gorgeous and looks good kickin ass. Some of the guys in the flick looked like they trained with Rex Kwan Do from Napoleon Dynamite. Someone needs to put Shannon in a big budget flick with a cool director. She is awesome.
2,don't beleive what you see,"1st off, the dragon fly is backwards from the picture. When I opened the box and set it up, I immedialtely thought the tail should face outwards like it shows. Instead it faces inside the bowl....opposite of the picture. Also, DON'T beleive it when they say it's 10-1/2"" diameter. It comes in a 9"" square box. In reality, it's about 8-1/2"" diameter. They probably measure the diameter to include the dragonflys tail.. anyway it's stupid small.wish I got a different birdbath.Lied to in Woodland."
5,Lego Bionicle,"Purchased for my 10 year old grandson. There are no written instructions, so all directions are from pictures. He had no trouble with assembling various ""monsters"". Great for coordination and being able to build from the pictures."
3,fun 4 Grandson,My grandson Is six years old and with only a few hints from the instruction sheets had these two together in no time. I can't say they are his favorite Bionicles however he does play with maxilos alot and adding it to his massive collection makes him very HAPPY making me Very HAPPY!
4,"excellent content, okay readability","Although I agree with the reader from Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada that the book reads like a university textbook, I have found it very useful for designing and justifying my designs of online instruction. When someone wants you to change your design, you can respond by saying, ""According to Clark and Mayer, people who learn from integrated text and graphics performed 68% better."" Stats like that help to justify budgets!"
5,Buy this book!,"This book is the ultimate handbook to designing eLearning. It's easy to read, straight-forward style makes it a useful guide that you will pick up over and over. It's examples and principles can be used when justifying your design and development choices to clients both internal and external."
2,A little too dry,I was looking for a book that could provide tips on making online education more engaging. This book was rated highly by other reviewers so I pulled out my credit card and bought it. But I have to agree with another recent review: it's just too boring! The book is written in a style that is very formal and isn't very engaging. I'm a little disappointed that a book about instruction techniques isn't better written and a setting a good example of it's content.
2,Too Boring and Academic,"I found this book boring and not all that practical. It reads like a university textbook rather than a helpful resource for e-learning designers and developers. The example screens are often busy and it is often difficult to perceive the point that is being made. I live by the 80/20 rule, and wish that this book focused on the 20% of the content that will give 80% of the benefit."
2,Disappointing,"From looking at the cover, you would think that each of the shows would have about the same material included. Only 4 Voyager novels are excerpted, with only 6 Deep Space Nine novels. The main original series characters each get a chapter devoted to them. Picard is the only not-TOS character to get a chapter. It would be a bit NICE if the book had more balanced excerpts. Don't waste your money if you aren't an original series fan."
2,A re-hash of stuff I already have read!,"I have read and bought every Star Trek book on the market. I was excited when I heard about this book, and bought it sight unseen. I was so disappointed when I got it! I thought it would be ABOUT the books, but is is just re-prints of excerpts from books I have already read! Rip-off!! The timeline is interesting, and that is the only reason I gave this book any stars at all!"
4,A VERY HANDY REFRENCE AND OVERVIEW A GOOD STARTING POINT.,"To my knowledge, the best, simple, handy reference for Trademark available.It's very useful in planning and getting an overview.I give the book a 4 because anyone who can take the complexities and vagaries of legalese and make a useful book deserves it. I can not give them a 5 because they did not (and to be fair perhaps could not) address more of the vagaries of conflicting use and claims of trademark - perhaps that is another book.Very good overall, you won't be dissatisfied especially if used in conjunction with further state and web research."
5,Seriously....these NOLO books are definitive!,"This is my second experience with a NOLO publication and they are both easily definitive on the subjects. As far as this one....not only did it answer all my questions (I've owned 4 business for about 16 years) but more importantly for me brought up potential issues which I am now going to proactively deal with. At 450 pages...its a ridiculous value for those starting business or like myself who already have a business but not a team of attorneys on staff for these issues. This book goes far beyond merely presenting the facts and raising issues it instructs in how to proceed ,how to appeal and more. This is not just trademark, its copyright and domain names, and so much more.If you stumbled onto this item because you have trademark concerns...this will be the best money you have ever spent."
4,Trademark for Idiot Dummies,"Yes, even you, you mentally deficient legal mind can learn to protect your 'intellectual property'. My partner and I currently have two companies that we run and are in the process of amalgamating with a third. All the companies have their own logos and tag lines. I've always wanted a way to protect these logos without spending a lot (or any) money by having to hire a lawyer. Now I don't have to.Just follow the simple steps that are laid out in the book (some where near the middle) and based on what they tell you in the rest of the book, you should be good to go and covered. It's nice to know that in this day and age when people profit by stealing other peoples identities, you CAN protect your business and product name efficiently and effectively.Zeb Kantrowitz"
5,Do It Yourself!,"I wish I'd had this book a few years ago, when I did a service mark the hard way. It can be a long tortuous project, which is why most people opt to pay someone to do it for them. I had more time than money and successfully made it through the process. But it was not fun.Good news! With this book you can save a bundle and do it yourself. All the angles and necessary steps are fully and clearly explained. For any business or artist that needs to trademark or service mark a name or logo this is a must have."
5,still the greatest performance since Toscanini's.,"Both the cast and the conducting are uniformly excellent. No other commercial recording since Toscanini's historic one combines all the elements of greatness as this performance, yet this RCA set has by far the stronger Desdemona in Scotto, perhaps her greatest recorded perfomance."
3,Good stuff,"It's good to listen the last album from EMF, but thought it would be better than Stigma. Anyway Cha Cha Cha is one more to show us how good musicians they are."
1,Did not work,First time ever ordering from amazon and well the product dose even work. there are some items that are great and this is not one of them
1,Do not purchase things that are cheap.,I purchased two of these chargers & neither one worked. I guess like they say you get what you pay for.
1,Worked at first but,"Worked at first, however it shorted out after about a week, I would not really recommend it unless you are VERY good with cords."
1,pure crap...it doesnt work at all,"Yes it was cheap and it arrived quickly, but the adapter fits loosely and it will not transfer a charge. This is junk from China."
5,Absolutely perfect,This is the most amazing line of beauty products that I have used. I started using them about two years ago and stopped for a while. That was a huge mistake. I absolutely love these products and fully stand behind them. They are 100% organic and they are amazing. I was able to use them while pregnant which was a big concern for me since I read too many articles that link certain chemicals and fragrances and perfumes to learning and birth defects.
1,Worst Keel cd ever!,"This cd is not a good ""Keel"" release. All of the studio recordings are like ""The Right to Rock"" without balls and not nearly as good as ""The Final Frontier"" or their self-titled cd.It does have it's good points which are mostly on the Live portion such as ""Rock 'N Roll Animal"" and ""Cold Day in Hell"" the only good song on the studio prtion is the ballad ""Dreams Are Not enough""!Overall, if you want a good Keel cd pick up ""The Right To Rock"" or ""The Final Frontier"". I have a feeling this release was put out to fulfill their record contract."
3,Really?,"To say the studio tracks on this Cd are good is not accurate in my opinion. The live tracks are good, but the studio tracks bring it down. Cold day in hell is the best song and that's because it's from the best album by Keel, Lay down the Law."
1,This is terrible!!!,I listened to this the other day and I was so disappointed. I do not recomend this for anyone. I was terrible!!
5,Tight As Hell,I really like Blaque cuz there r pretty. At our school they play that song in tha mornin and every day. There is a certain point to tha song so we know what time be in 1st period at 7:30. I recorded tha video and took it to school so durin the lunches we would play tha video. I be back to write more. Gotta bounce peace Y'll...
3,Anxiety and Panic Attacks,"I found ""Embracing the Fear"" by Judith Bemis and Amr Barrada to be much more helpful."
1,bait & switch,"Lucinda has a radio add that offers a free tape. I called for the free tape, & was subjected to the most high pressure sales attempt I've experienced in quite some time. They practically insisted I go ahead & order the whole program under a ""money back if unsatisfied in 30 days"" attempt. I told them 3 times & quite clearly NO! They hung up on me...To my way of thinking, the majority of her callers are already depressed and/or anxious, and to treat them this way is unethical. What if I was suicidal (I'm not)? This could have been the final straw. When you market to depressed people, this needs to be considered.Based on this, I'll never read another one of her books. This one was a complete waste of my hard earned $$, & I'll not buy, read, or recomend any of her products."
4,Very helpful advice! Offered hope. Author was sincere.,"I almost cried when I read the first couple of chapters because I thought ""Finally! Someone else understands what I'm feeling!"" It reassured me that being anxious doesn't mean I'm crazy. Besides giving me hope that I can conquer my panic attacks, it gave me concrete means by which to achieve my goal, step by step. Since the author had experienced panic attacks himself, I felt a bond with him. It was like a friend giving me encouragement and guidance. It also made me feel better about myself, which is one of the steps in overcoming panic attacks. Now I just have to put his advice into practice!"
3,Not bad...but nothing to set it above the pack...,"I was impressed with this books approach to working through anxiety or panic attacks. But, I didn't find anything of noteworty exception to distinguish it from other books dealing with this subject.It is also a fairly 'quick' read....which, for anyone dealing with this type of issue, really should spend a little more time on. I felt like it was best served as an 'airport read; it's style just didn't lend itself to the thorough examination one struggling with panic attacks should invest in.Again, well-written and easy to understand...but I don't see this as a 'life-altering' read for anyone dealing with these issues."
5,This book is all you need,"This book is all you need to recover from anxiety and panic attacks. Within just a couple of weeks, I felt much more in control of my life and more confident that I could change my life for the better. I highly recommend this book to anyone with anxiety and/or panic attacks. Before you go and spend money on psychotherapy or doctors, try this book...it will be all you need."
4,A Successful Approach,"The value of this book is that it teaches a successful approach to alleviating the symptoms of panic attacks and anxiety. First, through his story, and the stories of others, Mr. Handy gave me the feeling that ""I'm not alone"" in having to deal with these problems, and that it is possible to get on the road to recovery. He suggests a real plan on dealing with the problems of panic and anxiety, which I have found really works. I strongly recommend this book for anyone suffering from these problems."
3,Review of Parliament Japanese 2009 reissues,I have listened to the Japanese remastered 2009 reissue which is the exact same as the 2003 Island Def Jam Domestic reissue.Both versions have one bonus track which is Mothership Connection single edit. The audio quality appeared to be the same on both CD's. The only thing good about the Japanese version is the packaging. It is a mini cardboard replica of the original LP but the CD is only silver with black writing on it. The domestic release CD has yellow and green artwork on CD.Save your money unless you need the cardboard mini LP replica jacket.This applies to the other Japanese reissues of the remaining 8 Parliament CD's as well.
5,Senior in high school,1976 was the year of the funk and P-Funk was at the top of the list! Keep funkin George.
5,They got a stride in their glide,"This is my favorite Parliament album. This one just has all the things that make Parliament great. Killer grooves, great choir (funk community?) vocals, etc...Night Of The Thumpasorus Peoples has one of the greatest bass-lines of all time. This is one of those tunes that Parliament could have just vamped on for 25 straight minutes and it would have been perfect. Not to mention the layers of chanting that envelop the tune! That and Unfunky UFO are the two songs that really clinch this album's ""best"" status for me. The only song on here that I skip over all the time is Handcuffs. That tune just does nothing for me at all.Parliament certainly has other great albums, but this is really THE ONE that makes me wish I had been born earlier than 1975 and been able to catch this incredible group in concert."
3,Parliament Tape,The music is great. I remember it from when I was a teen. The only reason I didn't give you a 5 is the tape case was broken on one end. I had to get an old one I had and replace it. Don't worry about it...Sandra
5,The Boys are still makin' noise and tearing the roof,"This is the classic and essential Mothership Connection. P-Funk wants to get funk up, give up the funk, Handcuffs, and the title track. This is the best funk album you will ever own."
5,Love It!,"OK, It's not as tasty as Muscle Milk, but that's because it has virtually no carbs or fat- not drinking this cause it tastes good. Like both the fast and slow releasing protein."
5,great protein,"This is the best protein I have ever had, you need to add a little more than 1 scoop to make it taste best, but it is low calorie, low fat, high protein and low carb, what else could you possibly want!"
2,does not dissolve well,"I would like this product except that it doesn't dissolve well in water. Instead, you get these little protein clumps that are unpleasant to swallow."
5,"yay, been waiting this","I've been waiting for this final season for quite awhile. Glad to have it.Being a long time Henson fan, I was excited when the final installment was released through Lionsgate. I didn't want to sell my other sets, just to be able to afford the 'complete collection' that was released by HIT in place of the final season. I loved the artwork and tid bits that came with those previous seasons.This extra content on this is wonderful, the only thing not included is any artwork or similar.With the exception of the missing comp art this collection is perfect and a wonderful addition for any Henson/ Fraggle fan."
5,Fraggle Rock - Rocks,My son has seen the previous 3 seasons and has fallen in love with the series. He really is enjoying the final season. He is almost done with all the DVD's. So glad that he can experience this show as I did when I was his age - 10 years old.Always has him singing and dancing and lots of laughs.
1,Product did not work. Luckily easy return policy worked well.,This product did not play on either of my dvd players or on my computer. I returned it. Amazon's return policy was easy to work with and fast.
1,"damaged product sent, and not replaced, never refunded shipping","i ordered this as a birthday gift for a relative. they recieved it broken, they had to mail it back, and pay for this return shipping, in return , they never recieved another one. Media planet never refunded the returned shipping and never replaced the video, i had to buy it somewhere else."
5,"Love the show, not the packaging","Love the show hands down! But the packaging was a disappointment. I have the first three seasons and have waited a long time for the final season to be released. I was hoping that the packaging would be the same as the previous 3 but it was not. To be honest I would have paid extra money to have the ""extras"" that were included in the other seasons. Such as the booklet and the unique way that the others were put together not some plastic case like this one. But all in all the show is what really matters and I am pleased with that."
4,finally!!,"So Hit Entertainment finally listened. . . Sort of. We got the final season by itself, but the packaging is sh---y and it doesnt have any of the cool inserts that the others do. Worth the 19.99 I paid for it, but not the 29.99 it's MSRP'd at."
3,Full of History,"Touch of Lace is an enjoyable read steeped in Irish history for 1840s to 1850s, but it did not engage my heart. I like to become emotionally attached to characters in a novel, but Stephen and Anna never quite found that special space. Anna had been abused by unscrupulous males since the age of 12. Stephen wanted to protect her and he succeeded though he often was vindictive when he didn't get his way. She thought she was married to Billy Massie who had abandoned her but appearances aren't always what they seem. Thankfully she and Stephen found happiness in the end and could give Rory the family he deserved but the journey was a little tiresome along the way. I will say this is a fast read which was good."
4,"Excellent exhaust system, Weak U- Clamps","The Gibson exhaust is an excellent CAT-Back system. Once Broken in, the sound was really good. power is noticeable at high revs (dont expect much difference though).The only negative thing is the week clamps supplied with the system. I was tighting them to 65 ft/lb (recommended by manufacturer) and the clamp thread snapped. Gibson after sales service is really excellent as they have sent a replacement straightaway. I opted to buy a Stainless Steel Clamps so i would avoind having the same problem.Another negative thing is that the stainless steel Tip was affected by the exhaust heat and i could see rust and colour changes in it.Aside from that the performance is excellent."
4,Good protection while still keeping the system small,"I bought these today because I lost my old black pouch the micro comes with and my screen is all scratched from keeping it in my pocket without a case. I took a look at all the official cases manufacturers make for the micro, but a lot of them seems to increase the overall size way to much which kind of defeats the purpose of keeping the micro in your pocket. I bought it because it was tiny and I could just stick it in my pocket on the go.With these gameboy micro ""sox"" it barely increases the overall size of the micro and can keep the faceplate safe from scratches. I'm giving it a 4 because it's nothing amazing, but practical. And it's not too overpriced, like ipod accessories lol."
5,A gem,"Morgan's Passing is one of my top favorites of Anne Tyler's many books, perhaps because I'm a midwife, and the book contains one of the most hilarious, compassionate, and realistic childbirth scenes I've ever read. Morgan of the title delivers a baby in a car, and when he asks the guy to get some newspaper, the flustered fellow asks, ""The Times, the Post, or the Trib??"" or some such nonsense. And believe me, I know from experience that you just can't make that kind of stuff up. It's true, it's all true.But back to the main theme. Morgan is a very odd and very irritating eccentric, married to a clearly long-suffering wife with whom he has seven children. All girls. Morgan works in a hardware store where he mostly tries to talk people out of buying the stock. Morgan talks and talks and talks and talks. And Morgan is going through a confusing slide into a mid life crisis.It makes for some of Tyler's best writing - and for some of our best reading."
4,Eccentric mid-life crisis and human bonding,"Morgan and Emily's destiny is sealed after the ersatz obstetric delivery when the book opens.Morgan is missing or has missed life so he enacts many roles beyond that of just Cullen Hardware store manager.This ultimately leads to his settling down with mistress-puppeteer Emily and surviving the mid-life crisis that had engulfed him. In addition,I'm surprised Morgan didn't suffer a nervous breakdown given he was living with a stoic wife,a mother with Alzheimers and a sister who never changed out of her bathrobe.And then all those daughters....Great book,great detail and subtlety of prose."
2,grey and dull with a few nice moments,"Having read other works by Anne Tyler, a typically morvelous author, I am extremely let down by the quality of this novel. The main character is eccentric, but not in a remotely charming way. The reader stuggles to turn the pages, only slightly interested and very frustrated with the bumbling mid-life-crisis of a central character. There is the occasional gem of a poingnant, fascinating thought or two, but these are scattered throughout pages of grey. Anne Tyler is a lovely author, and I do recomend that you look into other novels of hers if you are interested, you will not be disappointed (A Pathwork Planet and The Accidental Tourist are both delightful). This novel is obviously just a dud amid Anne Tyler's strong repertoire."
5,Have to finish this book!,After reading about one third of this book I began to wonder why I kept reading. Then all at once it grabbed me and I couldn't stop.
4,Another wonderful read from Anne Tyler,"I loved this book. The main character Morgan is such a funny fellow. A hardware store manager, he enjoys dressing up and pretending to be other people. This leads his life down an entirely different course one day while he is pretending to be a doctor, and is called upon to deliver a baby.All of the characters in this book are so well developed and comical in their own right. Morgan's wife, whom he eventually leaves for a younger woman, is spiteful but in such a lighthearted manner that the tricks she plays on Morgan come off more as harmless pranks than malice. I would highly recommend this book."
2,Not Tyler's better works,"Has this been any other author, I would have stopped reading after the first few chapters. But as is sometimes the case with her earlier works, I kept reading on in hopes that the book would get better - it didn't.After I got through enough of the book (having only about 100 page left to read), I just had to skip to the end to get the experience over with.As another reviewer worded, this was quite one-dimensional and the characters were a bit disturbing, but not in the good sense, and the story just dragged on for far too long.I grew annoyed having put so much time into reading this and it was quite the let down. Tyler's later works are much better and if you want to get of those books, you'd be better off.I don't recommend this book at all."
1,audiobook,Received in a timely manner. In good shape as promised. Audio book is terrible. Boring. Narration is monotone. don't get this book.
2,One dimensional,"It is really difficult to like a book where there are no likeable characters. Morgan is a middle aged man who leaves his wife and many children for a much younger woman (that he seems to stalk for a while). There are so many disturbing factors in this book that revolve around the main character (stalking of his new wife, impersonating a doctor, impersonating a postal worker, etc) that it made it very difficult to empathize with any of the emotions he might have had. The book also seems to 'glaze' over the 'weirdness' of these behaviors."
1,Actions without consequences,"Morgan spends his life pretending he is somebody else. . .doctor, inventor, whatever. He leaves his wife of thirty years and seven kids to break up the marriage of a young couple and their kid. No comment is made as to how this affects the children--the creep is presented as a funny charmer. If you think divorce and abandonment is a joke you will love this book."
1,Ineffably Disinteresting,"I read this book as part of a book discussion group I had joined and it was so wretchedly lackluster it proved to be the death knell of me ever going back to the group. This book was half-baked, boring, and grievously devoid of even the tiniest bit of interest. I can't even give it credit for having any sort of vocabulary beyond the comprehension of an average twelve year old. The characters were so flat that I didn't even finish it. Later I heard from the other book discussion members even the title was a let down as Morgan never actually passed away (`twould have been a fitting end though - much like converting a testy horse into glue, something of actual use.) I've never read any of Anne Tyler's books but after this little gem I doubt I'll ever pick up another."
2,Got through it - somehow,"The Accidental Tourist is MUCH better than this. Tyler has talent; how she ever told this tale is beyond me. Morgan is not a hero; he's a bumbling, eccentric and selfish man who doesn't have a clue. It would have been far more interesting if she had told the tale from the wife's point of view. To have this much home-wrecking in one book, and so little emotional fall-out is unbelievable. I think Tyler can do better."
3,Good but for older kids,"I bought this and two other volumes for my sons (both under 10). It is fun, and they had good time reading it, but when I read it, it was obviously for kids at least 10. That is the only gripe on this."
2,A little too slight for the emotional baggage,"Sorry to rain on everyone's parade, but I found this story too light-weight to work for me.This is a very short book -- 58 small pages with double-spaced text; you can read it in 30 minutes -- and its delicacy is undeniable, the language expertly handled ... but I didn't feel I got that strong a sense of the characters, and its Hallmark-card fable quality just didn't do it for me.It's not that I don't like Gallico; I've loved _The Man Who Was Magic_ (Amazon doesn't even LIST it, in or out of print!), and have just finished _Mrs. 'Arris Goes To Paris_ (for which I will shortly compose a rave review). But this one did not do the job. Too allusive, I guess."
3,'The Snow Goose' by ~Paul Gallico,"The snow goose.Paul gallico wrote the snow goose during the Second World War.The story is about a deformed man who takes care of animals, when a young girl knocks on his door with an injured bird and takes it inside.The young girl really liked the man and they soon became friends.The man wants to go to war to help people but won't let the girl go with him.The snow goose is important because it is made to be a kind of angel.I didn't' really like the book because I thought it was boring my reason for this is because I thought was a dual story, the ending was to sudden and I didn't quite understand it.I give this book three stars.By Jo lynch."
3,snow goose,"I bought this for children and was disapointed when the stories promoted the older man falling in love with the young woman and the women needing a man to save them. I prefer fly away home. However, it does teach that disabilities don't interfere with a person's character or ability to love or be loved and there is pro=nature involvement that I liked."
3,a simple but moving story,"A simple tale, told in a simple, restrained manner...when one reads it, one comes to understand why it has remained in print for so many years. There was too a very nice video years ago, which I have been searching for, including at Amazon.com, but have been unable to find. It complements the book well."
5,Best Book I Was Ever Forced to Read,"The 7th grade grapevine said a substitute would come in for this reading every year because the teacher always cried. Oh brother!I'm glad it happened. It is now my favorite short story.(classified as such back then). It is a heartwarming/rending story about loyalty, friendships, kindnesses, unimagined bravery and love. Each experienced by a girl, a man and a beautiful snowgoose. Recommended for both sexes, and anyone old enough to read.I too, would love to get my hands on the cassette tape, and the movie. PBS ran it about 20 years ago. Please help!"
5,GOOD READ-- A Warm Book of Love and Separation,"I'll rate it a 5 star. It is a short book, but it is really great. It is about a lonely and ugly lighthouse keeper od Dunkirk, Philip Rhyader, with love in his heart to all living things. He respected life and was a loving person, but sadly, people did not accept him for his appearances. That was sad, and he was really, really lonely until a girl, 12 year old, called Fritha arrived in the lighthouse, with a snow goose, injured by hunters... Then it was the second world war, which cruely changed the lives of the 3.As I said, it is sad, but warm. It was also very romantic... but suitable for all ages. In the other hand, it has all elements of literature so it can be used for educational use. It is great. If you don't read it, it'll be your loss."
5,Superb help just when you needed it,"The fatherly voice of professor Ralph McInerny may not inspire everyone to write, but it has provided much motivation to get me going.Let's Write a Novel is a novel (pun fully intended) 12-cassette tape course and workbook by the author of the Father Dowling mysteries and the novel ""The Red Hat"". This series of lessons and accompanying workbook offers step-by-step instructions for writing a novel.McInerny discusses plot, characters, and points of view using his own unpublished novel ""The Prudence of the Flesh"" which is included as well.Writers will find his persistence either endearing or irritating as he urges them to complete their writing exercises and write along with him. McInerny is adamant that the writer must write a set number of pages each day.Vandamere also sells McInerny's popular ""Let's Write a Mystery"" and ""Let's Write Short Stories"" tapes."
5,Helloween at their peak!,"Helloween has always been one of my favourite bands. It's however curious how they became really a top level band after they lost their leader (Kai Hansen, who left to create Gamma Ray) and their great singer (Michael Kiske, who left for a solo career). Beginning from The Time of the Oath they've been on a continuous rise, topping in power with Better Than Raw and in quality and melody as well with The Dark Ride. This album is fantastic: songs as Mr. Torture, If I Could Fly, Live for your Pain and The Dark Ride are absolute masterworks, but the others are not so below. GET IT!!!"
2,Horrible,"Andi Deris is simply a bad singer. 'He was not the right choice for Helloween.Uli Kusch's drumming is annoying, repetitive, boring, indulgent, it subtracts from the music, innstead of adding to it.THE DARK RIDE was the swan song for Uli Kusch and Roland Grapow. They will not be missed. Nor the band as a whole who, to speak the truth, finished for all practical purposes when Kai Hansen left them."
2,ANOTHER AVERAGE RELEASE,"It seems to me that Kai Hansen's Gamma Ray and Michael Weikath's Helloween are on a race to see who release the most predictable albuns... The well went dry a long time ago for Helloween, but they still must pay their bills... so they keep releasing this weak ""metal"" albuns, utterly boring. OF course Grapow and KUsch are great musicians. But Deris voice is horrible, Weikath's mechanical playing is atrocious."
3,Nice map for tourists,"This map is nicely laminated, easily folds to a convenient size, and covers the main parts of Washington DC. However, as I have recently moved to Washington DC I wanted a map to improve my way around the city. The map is nice if you are a tourist to DC who wants to see the main sights, but for myself I wish the map would cover a somewhat larger areas outside of the Mall."
3,Just okay,"The map itself is nice enough, but it never seemed to show what I needed it to. It was useless for driving into DC from MD - didn't show near enough detail and the medium zoom map needed a few more streets to be useful for me."
4,Very Small Print,I currently do not wear glasses but I may need them after reading this map a few times. We will use it for reference in regards to the Metro but otherwise it is very difficult to see anything. Very detailed however.
2,Laminated Maps,"Laminated maps such as this one of DC (where I live) are insufficient. Get the big-sized paper map in a book store or you will wish you had. The one here lacks details north of Adams Morgan's central district, for example."
2,Expected more,I was looking for a detailed map with street finding capabilities for DC and the areas around DC for potential relocation and this particular product does not deliver
4,love these maps,"LOVE these maps, have used them in various cities and can always trust them. I recommend them highly. This product came on time, as described. Very happy."
2,DC Map,This map was too abbreviated to meet our needs so we returned it to Amazon. We used our Rand McNally map to enjoy our visit to DC.
3,Helpful but very small,"This is a very nice map for giving an overview of the metro area, and the detailed view of the Capitol Mall is very nice. However, it is too small and hard to see for navigating around DC. For a visitor planning a trip and having a quick guide while walking around it is great, but for navigating while driving it is not well suited."
5,"Compact, convenient, helpful","Perfect for carrying around for quick reference to the DC area. It is sturdy, and won't rip apart. Having the metro map is a huge plus."
5,Handy Washington DC Map,This map was great to have on our trip. It showed much of the Washington DC area including Georgetown. It also showed all of the subway stops on the street map which helped us to decide which stop to use many times. The lamination made the map very durable and in good shape even when it got wet.As an Amazon Prime member I was able to get free 2 day shipping on this.
5,Excellent map for DC mall details,"Perfect size to fit flat in a purse, very detailed for the mall which you need. Also sturdy enough so it doesn't rip at the folds."
2,Loses Something,"AFter listening to Ten Thousand Angels, I rushed out to by this album and was let down. If I Don't Stay The Night has none of the raw emotion or sauciness of it's Mindy's debut album, it comes off dry and boring save for the title song and her take on Linda Ronstandts Long Long Time"
1,"My word, what an awful book","This book has to be the worst logic book I have ever seen in my life. (And studying logic, I've seen my fair share.) If you want to learn formalized elementary logic, I would suggest going with one of the classics. This piece of junk, written by Richard Jeffrey, had me reeling in pain from page one to the index. His examples are boring and silly, his writing is pretentious and haughty, his problems are mindnumbing and from another era. The whole time you read this book, you wish you were sitting in the dentist's chair getting your wisdom teeth out, because that would be a less painful experience. The way that Jeffrey goes about solving problems is archaeic ... I wonder if Jeffrey has ever read a real logic book in his life. His examples leave you constantly asking ""What?"". All in all, a very sad attempt at teaching first-order predicate logic."
2,disagree in part,While my copy of this book did not seem as inviting as the Schaum's outline its tree method was used by professor McCarthy at uiuc in his explication of Boolos and Jeffries Computability and Logic.
1,bent sticks,"when I got first, the sticks were bent.OM..Gi felt the proverb ; 'you get what you pay for' by buy this sticks"
4,Good pair,"the hickory wood makes these sticks lightweight yet tough., the smoothness of the pair is really great and easy to play fast-paced music."
2,College must be hard to write about,"First, this book was not written by the same Rick Cook that wrote the ""Wiz"" series of fantasy novels.This book is about college in general and sort of about college politics, but rather ineptly executed. Stephenson's ""The Big U"", is similar in subject, but has more to hold the reader.The story is about a college freshman who discovers a 40 year old secret about a department head. The book itself reads as if it was not fully finished. Characters appear, are described and given backstory, and then don't have any real role. (e.g. Jim who is followed for several chapters but who's only real role in the book is to bring the protagonist and the department head together for the fizzle of a confrontation at close). The conflict itself is not that compelling either."
4,Still and always a key reference,"This book belongs on every serious biologist's bookshelf -when it isn't on your desk, in your easy chair, in the clutches of your students, etc. Not as ""easy a read"" as Mayr's more ""popular"" books like the wonderful ONE LONG ARGUMENT, this was and is a definitive statement on key elements of the evolutionary synthesis. Get it & read it!"
5,Breath-taking...,"An amazing video capture of a concert on her ""Vespertine"" world tour, during which she was accompanied by a full orchestra, a choir from Greenland, harpist Zeena Parkins, & electronic duo Matmos. Highlights include ""All is Full of Love,"" ""Human Behaviour,"" and ""Pagan Poetry."" A must have for any Bjork fan!"
5,BJORK BJORK BJORK,this dvd really blew me away.1.quality- unbelievable2.length- plenty of bjork +extras3.beauty- bjorkif your a bjork fan you won't be let down here.****************************************
5,They are the Best!,"My boyfriend and I went to Wherehouse to find some CDs...and he grabbed this one out of the many used CD piles...He was like""oh my, there is somebody who doesnt like The Corrs??? He/she must be an idiot...they are the best..."" anyway, I have heard their music before, but I didnt know that they sing those songs...I mean, you hear those songs from time to time and you can hardly forget them...'Dreams' is one of them... My boyfriend's sisters Wenche, Charlotte, and Vibeke like The Corrs as well as my bf Bjorn does. Actually they introduced their music to him...I am looking forward to their new release... too bad that in US they only released two albums so far...*hoping for more* Its easier and cheaper to get the CDs in Norway though....oh well, all in all, The Corrs's the BEST! =)"
4,The Beautiful Noise,"Do not buy this CD if you don't have an open mind. You'll listen to it once and think... ""Huh?"", then probably never listen to it again. That would be a shame. This is noise, pure and simple. It's also some of the most beautiful music you'll ever hear. He has taken a wide assortment of odd sounds and molded them into something else - something grander.""Kepler"" is an interesting marriage of chime and voice, with the sound of angels floating about. ""Icefall"" is simply breathless in its digital melody. ""Tiddler"" has a nice lullaby sound to it (liked a warped version of Bach). ""Taw"" is the only track I couldn't get into (ergot, 4 stars). ""On a Balloon"" could easily fit into a spaceage version of an Ennio Morricone score.All in all, I really liked this CD..."
3,the mold was free,"This was not one mat but many peices of cocotek, I should read the description more often but I'm a visual guy. They also seemed to come with a nasty white mold that grows fast near water. Soaked them in Hydrogen P and all is well. Mold can come from anywhere damp and may have happened during shipping. The package was a box with the unprotected mats inside."
4,cut smaller than stated,"(ignore the person claiming ""mold"" on their matting, these mats have natural rubber in them that often turns white when they get wet)This is the premium Cocotek matting, cut into pieces at a much more affordable pricepoint than the giant rolls. I took away 1-star for them being cut 1/2"" smaller than stated in the description. The actual size was approx 9.5"" x 19.5"", so they barely worked for my needs."
2,Too small!,The mats arrived unwrapped. They are also cut a little bit smaller than a 20x10 tray. The Sure To Grow mats seem better for germinating seeds.
1,Are you people SERIOUS?!!!!!!!!!,"I absolutely love, and I mean love horror movies..... I don't know what everyone else here saw, but it couldn't have been this movie. This was probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life....just don't watch it."
5,"Solid Design, Rigid Molding, Durable Case","I purchased this case over a year ago and it has stood up to daily wear and tear. The case is solidly designed, I particularly like the cap. Unlike many other level cases that I own require you to push in a nub to release the end cap which over time wears and softens, causing concern that the end cap may simply fall off. This end cap screws on for a solid, clean, tight fit every time. Additionally, the case is molded with a nice heavy plastic with ridges in all the right places to provide structural support to protect the investment you made. I am back reviewing this item a year later as I am purchasing an additional case."
4,An enjoyable weekend story,"Though I don't normally read Regency romances, I tried this one and enjoyed it. I wish though, that there was more detail and information provided. Its hard to do justice to a nice story in 216 pages. I liked all the characters, but again they could have been better developed. I agree with the observations of the previous reviewers, but I still seem to have enjoyed the book much more than they did."
2,Descent to Bigotry!,"We purchased, and read, this book of Judge Armstrong; because we had enjoyed his earlier work, ""The Rothschild Money Trust"". Yet, even in our review of that work, we noted that Armstrong often crossed the line of bigotry, as we quoted Michael Hoffman, in averring that:""Racial obsessions obscure spiritual realities.""Sadly, Judge Armstrong here descends further into bigotry. And his bitotry is not only directed to Jews, but to blacks and Catholics as well. This is truly a disappointment, as Armstrong presents much that is important. However, his work is deeply tarnished by his bigotry. And we can not, therefore, in good conscience, recommend this work. God bless."
3,"Stevie B. is the man, but these are remixes","I just want to echo my fellow reviewers on the question of remixes on this album.In my view, Stevie B's work offers 80s freestyle dance music at its best - songs like Spring Love and Dreaming of Love have to rank among the best 80s dance songs.However . . . I would not recommend buying this album if you are looking to recapture the Stevie B tracks of yore as you heard them all those years ago. All the songs are here, but are remixed - which is offputting for those of us who remember them. I'm sure that these tracks will sound great to first-time listeners. They haven't changed too much to be essentially different songs - the quality is still there.For those of us who remember them from the late 80s, though, I would recommend finding an album with the original versions - he does have another greatest hits collection out (I don't know what kind of mixes are on it). If you're a purist like me, listening to remixes can be distracting."
2,Not what it appears,"These bags don't have a wicket, and so can't be installed in a bagging device. They don't have an upper ""lip"" either, so you can't create your own. I'm not sure how you are supposed to put ice in these, except very slowly and carefully. Great price, but not suited for a bagging operation."
3,Motivation and Personality,"I was assigned to read this book for my AP Psychology class, at first it was really boring to me, I'll be honest. But after a while it started to grow on me, and I began enjoying learning the teachings of Maslow. I agree with Maslow's pyramid of needs, and after reading this book I have began to notice when people's needs arent being met, and how aggitated they will get when trying to achieve the needs that they want. This book will open up a lot of people's eyes and allow people to see things in a different light, if they are willing to get through the very detailed sections of Maslow's ideas. Overall, the book was enjoyable, a little slow because it is basically a giant thesis paper, but still enjoyable and much will be learned from this book."
5,love.at.first.hear.,"I instantly fell in love the first time I heard this album. The first track, just the music alone captured me, then to hear the second track with the smooth, fluid, lyrics that Tumi laid on that track was amazing! This album is a refreshing taste of music that most music lovers crave daily. With a mixture of hip hop and jazz makes this album the perfect live bandish sound cd that I've heard in a while. These cats are very talented and I can't wait until they tour the States!"
5,Tons Of Fun,The jokes are great! It got me right from the start. An excellent introduction to an excellent series.
3,gravitation,"gravitation is a cute little boy loves boy romp ,although him singing the same song over and over again gets on my nerves, I cant stop watching it"
3,RIGGED,"My first experience with a Scottish straight to video..GHOST RIG suffers from a pace that is too slow for a horror movie of this nature to be totally effective. Too much of it is shot in the dark, and the characters don't establish exactly who or what they are. Jamie Bamber as Tom, the hero, and Jaason Simmons as Vincent, the fanatical leader, are well cast and the rest of the cast is adequate, if not thespianically (is that a word) sharp. It's not a horrible move, it is watchable and has some good plot twists at the end.Rent..don't buy."
2,"BORING, NOT SCARY, AND WHAT ARE THESE OTHER REVIEWR SEEING IN THIS??","What the hell have the people here rating this higher then 2 stars been seeing in this?This movie has been so boring from start to finish. A group of press people have landed on an oilrig about to be detonated to save it for some reason. But they can't find the crew that's supposed to be on it. As they search they end up being killed off. ZzzzzzzzzzThis movie is kinda the same thing as LOST VOYAGE. Only LV was enjoyable where as this movie stinks. Its not scary, the attempt at scares are absolutely pathetic, and not in a FUNNY way at all. PLEASE, I'm begging you to ignore these other reviews and understand this movie sucks."
5,Great fun for the whole family,"This is absolutely one of our favorite CDs, and my kids (and I) know it backwards and forwards. Some favorites are ""A You're Adorable"", ""Everybody Eats When They Come to My House"", and ""I'm a Gnu"".While I don't love ""Triplets"" and was a little nervous at first to play it for my kids due to the lyrics some find distasteful, I can only say that my kids have come to no harm by hearing it. They don't hate each other, even after multiple exposures over the course of many years. I still smile every time I hear it, mostly due to the fact that I absolutely could not get this song out of my head during the labor and delivery of my 4th child. Ha! It by no means diminishes the fun of the whole album.I whole-heartedly recommend it."
4,BIg Band,"Wasn't into the Big Band style when I first heard it. But, my son immediately loved it and we both know every song by heart now. We're huge fans of John Lithgow's childrens books and this is wonderful as well."
4,"Swell even for people who don't like ""children's albums.""","While I've never been a particularly big fan of either John Lithgow or kid's albums, this CD is enough to win me over. Despite (or because of) his liberal borrowing from such artists as Allan Sherman, the Hoosier Hot-Shots, and even R. Crumb and the Cheap Suit Serenaders, this is decidedly not just for kids, but for anyone who wants a light, fun, and entertaining album."
5,DEEEElightful!,"What a pleasure to listen to a kids' CD and not want to throw up from the saccharine silliness of it all! This is a terrific CD; great for singing along, dancing, acting goofy. My one-year-old son and I ADORE it. Can't wait to spring it on my husband next time we do a car trip. He'll be realllly surprised, since he is sick of Baby Songs and Music Together!"
3,"Fun, but a lot of the Same","Not a lot of variation in the song styles on this album, but a fun addition to your CD changer."
2,"stop, please!","These songs have too many words and John Lithgow""s voice goes a mile a minute. He sounds like Ethel Merman in a hurry. The band is too big and too much. Over rehearsed and over produced. Ten minutes into this, I couldn't take any more!"
1,BIG Disappointment,I am at a loss to hear what people appreciate about this CD. We were barely able to make it through one listening. This is a classic example of a CD that NEVER would have been produced had the artist (using the term very loosely) not already been famous for something besides music. The lack of talent and originality on this CD is apalling. It only gets a star because that's the lowest rating. I want my money back!
1,Phoney,"We have many kids CDs such as Ralph's World and Dan Zanes as well as the complete Raffi collection. We also play the kids (4 and 2) a lot of Orchestral and Chamber music from the Baroque up to Copland. They also like the Beatles and the Who. This CD smacks of the sort of phoney junk pushed on Broadway, Disney, Nick. The kids rejected it and we're proud they did. If you want your kids to listen to good honest stuff, avoid this disk."
5,Simply the Best Children's CD On The Market!,"I bought this CD off of the internet when my baby was 6 months old. She is now 2 1/2 and STILL loves this CD. She started at 6 months rocking her head back and forth. By the time she was one year she was making all the animal sounds for I Had A Rooster. Now, she sings along to all of them!My husband and I enjoy this CD the most because they are songs that our parents would sing to us and we enjoy the fond memories.It is such fun to be on a car trip with our whole family (5 all-together)and have the whole van singing along!I wish I could also find a video for this, as the one reviewer mentioned. I would be fighting for that place in line!Here's hoping that video comes out soon, if not, another CD as delightful as this one!"
5,Delightful!,"John Lithgow is a wonderful performer. The musical selections on the CD are fun and enjoyable. The only trouble I had was finding a copy of this recording, and here it was."
4,Fun little CD,"Fun CD for kids. Our favorite is ""A your Adorable"". Wonderful version of that song. Another hit at our house is ""Everybody Eats When They Come To My House""."
5,Fun for all!!,"A friend recommended this album and I bought it for my ""kid's stuff"" collection. My frequent visiting nieces and nephews constantly request ""Singing in the Bathtub"". They sing and dance to the lively tunes and giggle at the funny lyrics along with their silly Aunt. Their favorite and mine is ""I had a Rooster."""
5,Sing-a-long fun for everyone!,"Chock full of silly, fun and learning songs! Lots of great rhymes and rhythms - the kids will want to play it over and over so brace yourself; better yet just jump in and enjoy.My personal favorite: Cod Fish Ball which is not only fun to sing and dance to but also teaches the names of different ocean creatures with fun couplets. Those of you who hark back to the original three stooges will remember another favorite: Triplets. And, ""A you're adorable"" helps the little ones learn their alphabet.My nieces (both under 8) had the entire thing memorized in two days."
3,GREAT with on big exception...,"My three year old and I were up and dancing from the very first track..while my 5 month old happily babbled along. The songs are lively and fun. I was about to order it for all my friends with children when sadly I heard track #7 (Triplets). The lyrics are totally inappropriate for any child. They include:""We hate each other very much, we hate our folks.... Mamma says that we're a bore and what is more she didn't want to have us and we didn't want to have her no more"" It is so sad that that one song ruined the entire CD for me. I do not want my girls singing along to those lyrics!"
5,What Fun!,"My two-year-old son LOVES this album. When we come to the end of the CD and another album begins, he protests until I start ""Singin' in the Bathtub"" over again! It's great. He laughs, chuckles, and cheers through the whole thing. He even makes requests --- ""ABC Song, Mommy!"" (A--You're Adorable). And, I love it too. It is so great to be able to listen to children's music without the drone of Barney ..."
5,The whole family loves singin in the bathtub!,"My two year old, my three year old, the five year olds in carpool, my curmudgeonly husband - oh yeah, and me. We all love it. Irreverent, catchy, great musicians. Beats the heck out of Raffi!"
5,A Breath of Fresh Air!,"I bought this CD for my son a year ago when he was one, over the last year it has become a firm favorite, especially in the car. He cheers at the end of the songs that have a stirring finale, and is now learning to sing along to ""A - You're Adorable"". He also loves making the animal noises along with ""I Had a Rooster"". The bonus is, I love listening to it too and never get tired of the songs. It is certainly a breath of fresh air after you have listened to ""The Wheels on the Bus..."" for the hundredth time! So many pre-school music CD's seem to have the same old songs, but we love ""Singing in the Bathtub"" because it is so different and a lot of fun."
5,Must Have Kids CD,I urge you to buy this CD for your kids right now. John Lithgow is amazing. He is so funny and extremely talented. I love all the jazzy tunes and also the lyrics.
5,You'll be singing along in no time!,"ABsolutely delightful! Every song is packed with smart lyrics that are sung with the wit and talent that only John Lithgow can bring backed by tunes that will have you drumming the steering wheel and tapping your feet. I find myself playing the CD even when the kids are not in the car! My family's favorite ""Everybody Eats When they Come to My House"" -- great use of rhythms. ""Big Kids Scare the Heck Out of Me"" and of course ""Singing in the Bathtub"" .. singing all alone... Tearing out a tonsil ... just like a baratone. Hillarious!"
5,Does the job,"This cup hasn't spilled on us, is easy to clean, is easy for my 17-month-old to grip, and fits easily in cup holders. Would certainly buy again."
3,one leaks,"I bought these a few months ago. One cup works well and I'm happy with it. The other one, however, leaks. When you screw the top on the water just leaks out on the sides when you tilt it :("
3,disadvantage,"These cups are kool and very good, does not leak and all those good stuff but the disadvantage is after a while of being used the stuff gets stuck on the underside of the cover in and around the spout area and its very mucky and unsightly. You have to get a knife or some sharp object to dig it out but that isnt 100% effective and it just looks unhygienic and yucky. I had to dump mine. I prefer the silicone nipples. They are more hygienic."
2,Worked for about a month now LEAKS EVERYWHERE!,I have like 6 of these cups because they were one of the only cups my son would use. THEY SUCK! They leak everywhere out of the side! it is like a constant drip and when monkey bangs them then the valve comes loose and we have an even bigger mess. Very disappointing. Hope I can find a great cup.
4,"Great, but not immune to wear & tear","We have 6 of the small size and 2 larger ones. For the most part the cups are great, but about 4 months in, I noticed one has started to leak a bit when the cup is very full. I wash the cups, valves and lids in the dishwasher, and that may have warped them slightly. Oops! They are still better than the other brands, even with a little leaking!!"
4,Great 80's movie,"It took me a while to find this, because they didn't release this on DVD for a long while. FEDS is a great little comedy that is easy to watch and to enjoy."
4,You have the right to be entertained.......,"This movie is a favorite of mine, I lost the only copy I had of this movie to my ex-wife when I moved out so I had to order a brand new one from Amazon, it did not disappoint, Rebecca DeMornay delivers a terrific role as a marine turned wanna-be FBI agent. Mary Gross as her bumbling partner and now presidential candidate Fred Thompson as their chief instructor. The laughs come, however, not at a brisk pace but this is definitely one of those movies you can watch more than once just for the entertainment value. I whole-heartedly reccomend this movie. The only reason it didn't get a 5th star was because it was NOT on DVD, which is a shame it hasn't been released that way as yet, perhaps someday."
5,Very Funny Movie,This movie cracked me up. I have watched it over and over and I am waiting to buy it on DVD. This is a great movie to watch with your friends.
1,Does not work at all on any VCR,This was a defective tape that will not work at all on any VCR that we have. I was very dissappointed with this product
3,Wally George's Daughter And Michael Gross' Sister,"This flick is passable entertainment that meanders between the mundane to the mediocre. Like a Chinese meal it's forgotten after you've digested it. It purports to be a comedy but there aren't many laughs to be found here. Allegedly the makers had the full cooperation of the FBI and therein lies the double-edged sword. The depiction of the Bureau's training program feels authentic and informative, however, the film isn't very forthcoming about the warts in the agency. The film's saving grace is the terrific rapport between Rebecca DeMornay and Mary Gross whose efforts keep the enterprise afloat. A good performance is also offered here by Fred Thompson as the supervisor of the training program whom I would have voted for President if he had the stomach for it. This is an OK flick but it's certainly not worth it's prohibitive list price."
1,Review is not about the movie itself,"The movie is great and definitely deserves to be FORMALLY released on DVD. However, at the time of my review, the movie has NOT been FORMALLY released on DVD. If you buy one, be warned that you are most likely getting an illegal, pirated copy. Check on it before you buy."
2,An funny but not well made movie.,"FEDS review By Emilio TostadoA funny, but not well made movie, FEDS tells about the troubles that two woman trainees go through to become FBI agents. You'll find some chuckles, but this isn't a very strong comedy. It's main problem is that it's so short. 84 minutes is less than a half of an hour. This gives less time for jokes or explainations. The movie is also very, very corny and cheap. Nit-pickers will probably hate this movie. But, If you do like buddy movies (Leathal Weapon, 48 hours), then this will be enjoyable."
4,fun movie,I had to buy that movie coz I loved it back then when it come out on TV.It is just fun to watch two women making their way in the FBI Academy. Two total different characters helping each other to success.fun movie. love it
5,FEDS,"Love this movie. Have had it on VHS for quite some time. Now, I can continue to enjoy it on DVD whenever I want."
5,Seems well made,"The loops at either end are nicely stiched and not riveted -- having had rivets rip out in a flash I strongly prefer the stitching.The leather is a substantial 0.154"" thick (a little more than the thickness of two US nickel coins).Initially the black leather lead is quite stiff. Although I rubbed it down with a bit of neatsfoot oil, I think the leather would have losened up anyway.I use the lead for obedience work on a headstrong 88 pound male Doberman. The lead is easy to handle (once the stiffness works out) and more than up to the task of stopping even an energetic beast his size.I can't say enough about the merits of a thin lead like this when handling a dog. I can easly hold all but the necessary 8"" to 12"" when heeling the dog and yet quickly go to 6' long when working on stays, recalls or jumping.It remains to be seen how this lead holds up on the long term, but at the moment I'm optimistic."
5,Love stories brought to real life!!!,"I was very impressed, I found myself in the lines of Tom's poetry. Read the book I highly recomend it. You will find yourself in the poems you will be inspired and delighted to write about your own romantic life."
2,Jumps in logic,"The author, like many writings on religion, seems to use ceratin passages to back up her own opinion and discount passages that don't suit her agenda. I admit my own biases come into play here as well. I found some definite leaps in judgment. For example, when discussing choice, she uses the fact that God had plans for Jeremiah before he was born to assert that God chooses to create every person (though she begins the chapter talking about how God us gave free will- which should logically extend to the will to have sex). Not only does she therefore allege that we are all equal in stature to Jeremiah such that text that refers specifically to him should apply to us all, but she is basically saying that God plans rapes and other situations where pregnancy may result. To quote Dr. Paul D. Simmons, ""To argue that God either causes or permits rape and incest and consequent pregnancy, or that God causes every hideous anomaly, is to say blaspemous and heretical things about God."""
1,The worst CD ever made,"When a band can't really play or sing they should try to bring something else to the table: imagination, passion, interesting sounds, good lyrics or a sense of humor. Cadallaca has brought nothing. Introducing Cadallaca is without doubt the worst CD I have ever purchased. They are a total disgrace and an embarrasment to female musicians who have a tough enough time breaking into the guitar rock world without groups like this perpetuating stereotypes of girls not being able to play and getting by on their looks."
5,Lo mejor para Cristo,"que Dios te Bendiga Hermanaso en Cristo espero que con tu musica por es de gran Bendicion para mi vida porque dan animo a mi ser cuando estoy cansado. Dios te bendiga, Juan Carlos Chavarria"
4,Everything You Need to Know About Public Domain,"If you don't know, public domain content is basically anything that isn't protected by copyright and is free to use. This includes all manner of material from books and magazines, to photographs, movies, music and more.The issue in the U.S. is that copyright laws have changed numerous times throughout the years, so it can be difficult know is something is still under protection or not. This book has everything you need to know about copyright law to understand if a piece is in the public domain or not. Even better, it contains a number or resources for locating public domain works.As with most NOLO publications, you do not have to be a lawyer to understand the text. The information and presentation are top notch. I highly recommend this resource for anybody who works with content or needs to understand public domain."
2,Not what I was expecting,"I was expecting a book with numerous web links to public domain sites. Instead the book just talks about what public domain is, the legal laws around it, and other useless public domain information. There are very little public domain web sites mentioned in the book. Save your money."
5,Great for Internet Entrepreneurs,"As a budding internet entrepreneur, it's always a struggle to know what I can safely use in my information products, blog, or websites. The copyright law seems so complicated and difficult, and I haven't found any easy-to-understand internet resources for figuring out what I can legally use and what's off-limits.Enter this book - the crisp, clean design is easy to read and navigate, the organization is great for finding out info in a hurry, and the advice is clear and just what I need. Because it's a Nolo book, I have faith that the info is accurate and complete, and this book has helped me find and use a lot of fantastic free info and music that is out there for the taking.If it saves you even an hour of time of research on copyright, which it will, this book is well worth the cover price. It also gives fantastic advice on how to preserve the copyright on your own work, which is helpful for writers and bloggers. Highly recommended."
5,Fantastic album,"This is one of my favorite albums. Every song is excellent. I have been waiting for a follow up album for a long time,please can we have one."
4,An over-looked treasure,"Church's maiden voyage holds up very well even to todays flock of country-pop songstresses. Whats the Matter With You Babe spawned a good concept video as well. the studio released 2 songs from this recording as singles, but neither sold well. that really surprises me because this is a very good recording and certianly worth a listen."
3,Church Lady,"This CD has a few good tunes on it. I particularly like ""Streets of Nashville."" Otherwise, it's O.K. but didn't really grab me as a whole. The main problem is that the tunes are mostly neith catchy nor memorable. It was a good effort by a novice, but needed more development to really go anywhere. So 3 stars."
2,Don't waste your time,"Too much pop, not enough country. After all of the five star reviews of this cd, I was disappointed. Church offers nothing new or different for country music."
3,"Nice sheets, expected more though","These are nice sheets, they are the stretchy tee-shirt cotton knit, but I was a little disappointed in the fact that the only graphic depicting them as ""New England Patriot"" sheets was on the pillow case. There is a white-on-white NFL logo throughout the entire set. They were a gift for my 12 year old son, and he seems pleased with them."
3,Decent Popcorn Flick,"Phone Booth is basically an old fashioned morality play. We all know this playbook, a sinner is forced to face his sins in some way and find some measure of redemption at the end, except this time it all takes place inside of a phone booth in Manhattan. While not a great film, it's another one of director Joel Schumacher filmmaking redemption for his horrid Batman & Robin, a task he will probably have to perform for the rest of his life. So yes the film is short on the answers to the meaning of life and all that good stuff, but it's engaging and thrilling enough to be enjoyed as a popcorn flick. Nothing wrong with that, plus all the actors are great in it."
3,Don't answer that pay phone,"For taking place in a phone booth pretty good movie ,you can't wait to see what happens next,Colin Farrell(stu)a cocky publicist answers a phone in Manhattan and pays the price.To a sniper played by(Kiefer Sutherland)the perfect voice for this part,wants Stu to pay for his sins, the most intensted 90 min I've seen in a long time.For Jim Carey I don't know if he could of pulled it off as Stu,but who knows? Enjoy!!!"
3,A Suspense Movie,"I saw this movie not too long ago and I expected somewhat more of it. The beginning and middle were good, but the ending wasn't good...or at least as good as I thought it'd be. But I do like the storyline, a man who is dishonest and a liar answers a pay phone and finds himself talking to a killer who killed multiple men in the past. The ending is very suspenseful but...well I won't give it away. When you see the ending, you can decide for yourself if it was good or not."
2,non-thrilling thriller,"it wasn't a complete waste of time, but half of the time me and my husband laughed instead of ""biting our nails"".the mysterious caller's voice was in foreground, making it sound oddly like a joke more than a threat, and somehow the whole setup and plot was so contrived, ridiculous and artificial that this movie failed to move us. The tension never materialized as we perceived it as silly instead of threatening.Really, it would take a lot of effort for the stalker to reseearch potential victims to the depths suggested by the conversations with them.I gave the disc away right after the viewing - it is really not worth seeing it the second time."
3,Pretty entertaining,Phone Booth is a pretty Entertaining film and I must say That Collin Farell gave his finest in this film. The plot is very simple and I won't even tell you since there are hundreds of reviews you can easily look down to and see. Who'd think that a movie that takes place in a phone booth would be so entertaining. Yes the whole film pretty much takes place in one spot. I enjoyed it but it wasn't all that great. Pretty average film but enjoyable and I must agree with the other reviewer the ending in this film is kind of lame and sort of a cheap way to end it.Overall I enjoyed this film but not without its flaws and pretty average story though I give Collin Farell Credit for his acting(though I really don't like him I think he sucks at acting but then again what do I know about good acting..)3.1 OUT OF 5 stars..Lates
3,"Not ""morally bankrupt"" and not super but good",I'm shocked at how varying these reviews are for Phone Booth.It's not meant to be a deep movie. It's meant to be impressive on a couple of levels.#1 - It holds your attention for over an hour inside a phone booth#2 - You won't figure out the ending until it really happens and even then some miss it.Listen closely to the shooter's voice. Who is it? Look closely at the shooter when you see him (you will). Surprise actor!
2,"coulda, shoulda, woulda","in all honesty here, when i first saw the movie trailers for this movie on the tube, i thought it was nothing more than another ""hollywood"" thriller not the worth the celluloid it was shot on, so i awaited for it to come out on dvd/on demand tv, well the movie starts out pretty damn good and stays that way for 2/3s of the way, and then theres the ending which feels like, well there isn't much of a bloody ending. and it is baffling because like i said a good deal of the movie is above par hollywood material(notice i mentioned hollywood, lets not get ahead of ourselves here) that actually had potential to be a good dramatic thriller, but then why a non-ending that simply doesn't measure upto what the movie coulda, shoulda, woulda been, and the sad realisation is: this was just another concept movie made to try and make some quick money, its just a shame because this one coulda been more."
1,Phone Booth...,"This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen.I tried to watched it today, but after an agonizing hour, I walked out. It seemed that they had an interesting concept, but there's just not enough to make a whole movie out of. I got really bored and the characters weren't likable at all. Please do not waste your money on this movie."
2,Great Build Up - Disapointing Ending.,"Colin Farrel portrays a smaller-then-he-thinks publicist in this 80 minute 'thriller'. Although I have given this film 2 stars, I will say that the first 40 minutes of Phone Booth were actually quite gripping up until even Kiefer Sutherland's voice acting started to annoy me. And what made the film even more of a time waster was its rather stupid ending, making the whole film pointless as it really is a poor excuse threatening to kill a guy to, in effect, 'teach him a lesson'.Not that the acting was bad or charatcers annoying, its the screenplay that was poorly written, especially for Kiefer Sutherland. Attempting to make him out to be this psychopath, towards the end, you actually think it is in fact a comedian (a bad one at that) whose aquired a rifle and is having fun toying with this guy in a phone box.For Colin Farrel fans, you may as well see this, but for those who hate anti-climax's, don't bother."
3,What Could Have Been,"As with many other films, Phone Booth fell short on its potential. Instead of expanding the horizons of the movie, the director (Joel Schumacher) decided to cut the film in half. Don't get me wrong; I was on pins and needles waiting to see what was going to happen next. But at the conclusion of the movie, I looked at my watch and noticed that it was only 88 minutes long. Katie Holmes' character was a waste at best. I kept waiting to see why the hell she was in the movie at all. However the two main stars (Colin Farrell and Keifer Sutherland) were superb. Keifer had me forget about his day job (the hero on 24). He was back to his evil ways, just where he is at his best. Colin Farrell seems to be getting stronger as an actor but he needs to do a movie that will let him spread his wings."
4,hang up--and you die,"A fairly decent thriller. 3& 1/2 stars is closer to what I would give this film. I liked the direction--and Forrest Whitaker was perfect in the role of a detective who does his best to diffuse a deadly situation. Keifer Sutherland, never a great screen presense in my opinion, wears out his welcome early on, as the nutjob with his high-powered rifle trained on our man Farrell trapped in said phonebooth. The twist ending was not bad at all--although, somehow, the entire damn enterprise could have been a bit shorter.Hey, it's worth $7.50 --that's what I paid at Target for it."
4,Excellent!!!,"O.K I rented this movie and I liked it, who would believe that a movie that takes place in a phone booth will be so good.Great Plot, Great Setting, Great Movie"
3,a tour-de-force performance by Farrell,"starts out as Farrell's strolling down the block talking on a cell phone, talking to his pal, then he goes to a phone booth and calls Katie Holmes, whos hes seeing on the side, then it becomes really good with Kiefer on the other line, tempting Farrell not to hang up or leave or he will be sniped down. Then there's these hookers and their pimp and the pimp gets shot and the police come and the cameras. Farrell's wife comes. (Radha Mitchell( Pitch Black and High Art). Farrell gives a good shattering in the phone booth performance, but the ending is sort of like, WHAT!!!, buts its a good flick"
4,"""Phone Booth""","I just saw the the movie and it was very good. It was very suspensful! And Colin Farrells best proformence to date. He flew threw the emotions so fulentlly. It was great. See it. Especially if you are a fan of the movie ""Speed"". I takes a simple conspect and turn it into a suspensful masterpiece. The only thing I didnt like was the sexual referances. I thought they were unnessary. But overall it was a good movie check it out!"
3,Brilliant DVD Cover design,"I just want to thank whoever designed the DVD cover. In case anyone was curious during this thrilling mystery action flick about the identity of the anonymous mastermind throughout the film, now they need to look no further than the cover of their case to see the killer's face revealed in the last shot. Really, brilliant work."
2,Very predictable movie,I'm not sure why this movie got such good reviews. It was very predictable. I mean who didn't know what was going to happen. I was disappointed. But the movie made money at the theater.I wouldn't recommend it because I'm sure you;ve seen something similar.
3,Entertaining,"I caught this the other night on HBO and have to admit that I sat down and watched it... It was quirky enough to be entertaining and hold my interest, though there are points where the plausibility of the story falls apart..."
3,Great value for the price,"Bought it on sale. It was pretty good, but a bit predictable. Plot was a bit corney though. Enjoyed watching it."
4,Phone Booth,"love this movie, psychological thriller with out all the gore or bad language. would recommend. Very good acting and hold your attention from the very start. Ending very cool also."
5,Fabulous Film!,"I really loved this movie. I had expected very little except filthy language because of the poor reviews listed. Sometimes I wished I had believed the reviews and stayed away, but this was one time I was pleasantly surprised. From the opening shot, I was drawn in and followed each scene with the highest interest. I enjoyed the characters, and felt I knew enough about them to get the most from this film. Under the circumstances, I thought the main character's bad language fit the pressure of his situation, and was not excessive.The pace was quick, and I enjoyed it. Even though the story takes place mostly in the phone booth, the story was more exciting and involving than many movies with multiple changes of place.Take a chance and see this movie!"
2,A forgettable movie,Hardly worth a rental. I wouldn't own it or watch it again. It had a made for TV feel to it. It was very farfetched. This could never happen. Not much scare or gore either.
1,STAY AWAY 4RM THIS MOVIE,"This whole movie was so stupid. The whole time through the movie he was standing in the PHONE BOOTH. That was so stupid. When I went to go get the movie I thought the movie was gonna be good, and went and watched it was very disappointed with the movie. I would never and I mean never watch this movie again. I don't get the whole point of this movie expect that he stays in the PHONE BOOTH through the whole thing. IF I WAS U. STAY AWAY AND DON'T GO AND SEE IT BECAUSE ITS REALLY STUPID."
1,Dumbest Movie Ever!!,"first off, ill be honest i only rented this movie because of Colin Farrell....wasnt disapointed there. Otherwise this movie was horrible. The storyline was just plain dumb. This movie was not at all scary...the whole movie was colin farrell shouting f*** to a pay phone. Save your money. If you are looking for a great colin farrel movie rent SWAT, The Recruit, or Hart's War and you will be happyy"
2,Please Hang Up,"There's about 15 minutes worth of script here. At best this film could have been stretched into a taught half-hour TV show in the hands of a director like Alfred Hitchcock. However, those days are long gone. This is another example of a potentially good story premise poorly executed. The trailer says it all."
5,A TRUE MASTERPIEC E !!!!!!,"One of the best movies I've ever seen. Truly original, very suspensefull and thrilling, very creative. You never know what the hell's gonna happen in this one. Collin Farrel's performance is fabuloso. A must-watch. Own it, not rent it. You will not regret it. If you like original, suspensefull, thrilling and NEW (not the same garbage you see all the time) type of cinematographic movie. WATCH THIS ONE. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT !! I PROMISE YOU."
5,Surprisingly good,"The story is a simple one. Stu is a wide boy, shallow and selfish. One day whist going about his usual business he hears a phone ringing in a public booth and answers it. The caller tells him not to hang up or he will die. The mystery caller soon makes it obvious he is watching Stu's every move and that he is armed. The situation becomes worse when armed police surround the booth assuming that Stu is armed and dangerous. For once, Stu seems unable to talk his way out of a situation and, from initially being belligerent and cocky; he becomes increasingly afraid for his life.It doesn't sound much of a tale but the film is surprisingly good, thanks in the main to the strong leads, Colin Farrel as the wheeling dealing Stu and Keifer Sutherland as the mystery caller. The director manages to keep a good pace going, in spite of the limitations of the set, and the film is fast paced and tense. It's certainly a different film and one I would highly recommend."
4,Classy little thriller,"Joel Schumacher has directed some real stinkers (Batman & Robin) as well as some minor classics (Falling Down). Phone Booth falls into the latter category and is well worth getting.OK the plot is very sparse, but what there is is well scripted by Larry Cohen. The film is short (81m) and packs a big punch in that time. The best thing about it is ""the caller"". Unlike all other sinister phone call films I have seen, the callers voice is crystal clear and this adds another dimension (even if it is a bit unreal).The confessional aspect of the film didn't quite work for me, and there were parts of the final 1/3 of the film that I found a bit contrived. However, the final couple of minutes were a brilliant surprise, especially if you haven't worked out who the actor is playing the caller! You might want to rent it first in case its not your sort of film, but I recommend it anyway."
4,effective therapy,Therapy has never been so interesting or so effective. A creative idea that knows where to end and doesn't lack ambition.Colin Farrell's character is such a jerk that you're rooting for the one whose tormenting him but at the same time you want Farrell to come out of it alive and learn some valuable lessons.The exagerrated premise of the story is its creativity; there are consequences for certain attitudes and the story gives that lesson a lot of spice and suspense.
4,Use this Phonebooth,I rented this movie with a bunch of diffrent and mixed reviews.One person told me it [was bad].The other person told me it was great.The other person said she would rather be in a wheel chair the rest of her life than see this movie again.I say This movie was terrific.Colin Farrell gives an electrifying performance asStu Shepard a publicist who is a typical lyer.He is married to a woman named Kelly and has a girlfriend who he calls from thePhonebooth each morning.One day he walks into the phonebooth to call her and he hangs up after talking to her.The phoen begins to ring.He picks it up and begins to talk to a sniper played byKiefer Sutherland (who isn't seen until the end).When a strip club manager is shot by the sniper the cops believe its him.One of the cops played by Forest Whitaker figures out whats goin on.But I don't want to give the movie away.My suggestion to you see this movie.You will be in for a wild ride
2,"Phone Booth - Enticing Idea Falls Short, Rings Hollow","This film has a good cast, solid performances, and an interesting idea to launch the story. Unfortunately, the plot is thin, too short (less than 90 minutes for a live action movie!), and depends mostly upon the verbal dialogue of a character who is not on screen until the last moments of the film. It also has a somewhat dark ending which may disappoint many viewers (though I think the ending is actually creative by not having a feel good resolution). The film can make the viewer begin to think about the topic of integrity and self-honesty, although it is hard to do so when the character who invites the topic is a meticulous serial killer. The DVD has a wide screen version on one side and the TV screen version on the other, with limited bonus features. This is a movie to see on video or TV - if you watched it in the theater you may feel short-changed and peeved at the director for leaving you hanging."
2,What a long 80 minutes,"I started watching this film and feel asleep about one third of the way through. Had heard it was good so re-wound the tape again and started all over. Hated all the crude and vulgar language which added nothing to the film. Got a little past the part that I had watched the first time. Guess what - woke up when the ending credits were showing. What a waste of time, not only once but a second time."
4,Phone Booth's sound is JUST FINE!,"This is to Jerry from NJ who put up a review on 7-17-03, who is obviously not educated on dvd.When you play dvd's it's always best to select your audio choice. In this case, 5.1 is always the best default to choose, unless you have DTS. But that's another story.The 5.1 allows for the sound to be split into 5 seperate sound channels. When you are watching the film and the split screen conversations happen, those other audio tracks are going to your other speakers! If you aren't hearing them, it's not the dvd's fault. More likely your home theater, or lack thereof, isn't set up correctly. Best way to test a disc? Take it to an electronics store and demo it. 99 out of 100 times you'll find that your equipment is faulty or not able to play the disc, or you were a bonehead and didn't set up your theater right.Next time don't be so quit to point the finger at the dvd. Rather, ask around, and educate yourself. You'll end up happier about the product!"
2,Please Hang Up this Nauseating Farce,"There's about 15 minutes worth of script here. At best this film could have been stretched into a taught half-hour TV show in the hands of a director like Alfred Hitchcock. However, those days are long gone. This is another example of a potentially good story premise poorly executed. The trailer says it all. Did I mention that Colin Farrell is thoroughly obnoxious and downright nauseating? Only Forest Whitaker and Kiefer Sutherland keep this from being a one star zero."
3,Interesting But Not Worth The Call,"This film starring Colin Farrell is interesting at best but doesn't quite fill the bill.Farrell does a great job running through every emotion possible while being stuck in a NY city phone booth at the mercy of a creepy voiced sniper (played by Keifer Sutherland). But the film stays incomplete because nothing is ever explained. Why did the sniper pick him? What is the sniper's motivation? Had the motives been explained it may have been a hit.Don't waste a dime on this DVD, wait until you can catch it on TV unless you are a true Colin Farrell fan."
5,Don't even think about NOT SEEING THIS MOVIE!,"I AM THE BIGGEST COLIN FARRELL FAN! I THOUGHT THAT PHONEBOOTH WAS THE GREATEST MOVIE AROUND NEXT TO S.W.A.T.! PHONEBOOTH HAS A LOT OF ACTION WITHIN IT AND IT IS VERY SUSPENSFUL! I LOVE COLIN FARRELL AND I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS THE BEST PART HE HAS EVER PLAYED! IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE YET, I RECOMMEND THAT YOU GO SEE IT!"
2,big whoop,"This is just another one of those cockamamy real life on steroids type scenarios Hollywood keeps pumping out these days (Changing Lanes, Flightplan, Cellular, etc.). Not very imaginative."
1,"good idea, bad movie","I thought the idea of Phone Booth was great, but the movie is just bad. Maybe Hitchcock or Welles could have pulled it off, but this is just plain sad. Skip it."
4,WE NEED MORE MOVIES LIKE THIS TODAY!,"A SNIPER [KIEFER SUTHERLAND] TRAPS A NEWSPAPER WRITER [COLIN FARREL] IN A PHONE BOOTH THREATENING TO KILL HIM IF HE DOESN'T CONFESS HIS SINS. VERY SUSPENSEFUL AND VERY INTELLIGENT MOVIE. IN A TIME WHEN MOVIES LIKE ''LEGALLY BLONDE'' ARE RAPIDLY DOMINATING THE MOVIES, WE SERIOUSLY NEED SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO ESCAPE FROM THOSE STUPID CHICK FLICKS. IF YOU WANNA WATCH SOMETHING THAT'LL MAKE YOU THINK, GET THIS MOVIE NOW."
3,"Great, but colin farrel?","I have never been a big Colin Farrell fan. You know with the dating the slut thing. This movie looked good so I picked it up. I was very surprised by the films intense look. It is very heart pumping. You wont expect what happens next. Colin Farrell's perfomance though kind of killed it for me. Because he gets shot in the ear and he just goes you shot me. Then through out the rest of the movie they totally forget about it. That is why I only gave this film 3 stars. Also becuase theres no special features But this is still a great film, which needs good acting. Johny Depp or Mel Gibson either would have been better. This is a great film but only watch it for the pshycology."
3,At least it was a short movie.,"At least this movie was short. I can't stand Colin Farrell. You may disagree, but to me, he's a mumbling, bumbling, idiot. I don't understand why he's in so many movies lately. He sucked in Minority Report, he sucked in Daredevil, and he sucked in this. The movie, at least, was short. It kept you at the end of your seat, and I love Forrest Whittaker... but I can't give it a higher rating, because they chose this twit, Colin Farrell as the lead. Hrmph."
3,Not Bad,"When this came out, it sounded silly. Kept putting it off until my movie queue dwindled. Gave it a second chance. Not bad. I couldn't quite give it four stars, but it was better than expected.In some ways, the acting was almost too realistic (which makes it more life-like but less likely to win awards). For that, I would give four stars.But, there is a lack of direction. Too many starts that are abruptly halted. On the flip side, it was pleasantly surprising that it ended when it did (i.e., short film) instead of dragging on and on like some competing films."
3,interesting idea,This film had a very unique plot that would either work well or not at all. It actually did. the whole story revolves arould a phone booth andthe hero is not you typical one. More of an anti-hero with vices but you end up feeling sympathy for him. The directing and casting we good and all in alll a good movie to watch
4,Interesting,"Larry Cohen's flick Phone Booth is an interesting, not to mention unusual, piece of work. It plays like a vulgar movie length episode of the Twilight Zone. Colin Farrell turns in the performance of his life as the sleazy PR guy. On the other hand, Kiefer Sutherland fails to be a menacing enough phone caller and that dampens the fear factor in this flick.Given the profound lack of originality in Hollywood, any time a half way original movie such as Phone Booth comes our way, you simply have to at least consider giving it a try."
4,"Bottom line is Listen well, and speak the truth","I expected nothing out of this movie, and it turned out to not be to bad. Collin Farrell is held hostage in a phone booth in manhattan until he makes amends for his dishonesty. By who, well, I guess it is the world's best observer with lots of time on his hands (kiefer sutherland). It was amazing how the movie did a good job at covering the bases to make it so this the main character couldn't leave the booth. Often times in badly written movies within a few minutes you figure out how they people are going to escape. You do here as well, realizing it will have to be the police that figure out what is going on, but it was interesting and at least entertaining how they got their. Worth a rental, but not really a great thriller for the collection, at least in my book."
2,not too good,"**THIS IS ONLY FOR THE DVD**The extras are not too good, but it is a great movie.*Commentary by Joel Schumacher*Original Theatrical TrailerI dont recommend this DVD, it is recommended if the price is under $10.00, or if you like this movie alot. ALOT."
3,Intense Drama,"I was on the end of my seat during this entire movie. Colin Farrell is an outstanding actor, and he is perfect in his role in this movie. Forest Whitaker was also very good as the cop who helps him. I felt the female characters, his wife and his mistress, were somewhat one dimensional and lacking in character development. I also felt that the voice of Keifer Sutherland came across sounding too much like a newscaster, and was not scary enough. But then again, this movie belonged to Colin Farrell. If you focus on Colin Farrell and what his character is going through, you will be thoroughy entertained."
5,"""You'll be hearing from me""","Are the last words from the caller's (Kiefer Sutherland) chilling voice to the helpless man in the ambulance.(Colin Farrell). In this brilliant pyscho thriller, we follow an arragant publicist, Stu Shepard. Who constantly shouts lies into his cell phone. When observed by a sniper killer who watches him everyday, who thinks Stu should be punished. What better punishment is there by being threatened to be killed? Watch out for the surprise in the end in one of my favorite movies, Phone Booth. Expect a phenominal performance by Colin Farrell and don't forget the very chilling voice of Kiefer Sutherland. This movie is so underated. Be careful next time you answer the phone."
2,Phone Booth,"Phone booth was a complete disappointment. I am 14 years old, and I tried to watch this film with my father. We made it about a quarter of the way through the film and then we had to turn it off. The language is atrocious. The rating is R for ""provasive language and some violence"", but it should say ""extreme profanity"". Despite this, the movie wasn't even good. A guy is stupid enough to answer a ringing phone in a booth, blah blah blah. The ending was probably okay, but because of constant cursing, I wouldn't know. So if you're looking for a family movie, Phone booth is not the right route to take."
2,Terrible.,"This is an awful movie. A terrible premise supported by poor dialog, a snail's-pace plot Colin's ""acting"" and (despite my frequent enjoyment of him) Forrest Whittaker's... poor decision making. The cinematography was actually pretty good, and IIRC this movie was one of the early ones shot in the newer higher-def format at the time (2003?). But there's no way it's worth buying, and certainly no way it's worth buying on blu-ray. If you need to waste an hour and change of your life, go for it."
2,Skip,I could never get into this movie. I never understood the bad guy's motive and they made the lead charater to look like such a prick. Skip.
2,next time just leave the phone ringing.,I didn't really like this movie. At best this film is only average but if I were less gracious I would have to say below average with a mere one star review. I am in a good mood so I chose to give it two stars. If you have nothing better to do you might as well pull up a chair and watch this flick. If you do not have the time then do yourself a favor and don't squeeze it in your busy day.
2,Phone Home,"Considered by many one of the best movies of 2003, ""Phone Booth"" doesn`t have much to offer beyond what we already knew from the interesting premise shown in the previews. Collin Farrell gives a good performance as the publicist Stu, director Joel Schumacher keeps things going with a tight, controlled and effective rhythm, but one feels it could have been better and gone further. Sure there are a couple of intriguing twists, the direction is top notch and the soundtrack appropriate, though it ends way too fast and would be more adequate as an episode of some tv series like ""24"" (it even uses some of that series` camera techniques). It`s entertaining to watch Stu suddently trapped in a phone booth, at times even funny, but there`s no tension enough to make a strong, solid movie, just a nice idea that could have been better explored. Somewhat gripping yet too vapid, ""Phone Booth"" is cinematic fast-food."
3,"I was proven wrong, this movie is pretty good.","Before watching this movie, I couldn't imagine enjoying a movie that centered primarily around a single location. How boring, I thought. Well, turns out I was wrong. The movie is interesting and it kept my attention, moreso because of Colin's acting. Because there's not a lot of action in the film -- there is some, though -- the story relies heavily on dialog, which fortunately, for the most part, was good. In addition, Colin convincingly portrays a character that was under a lot of stress and in a sticky situation that he can't find an easy way to get out of. And believe me, he's trying. The ""bad guy"" is convincing as a lunatic that could do all he threatens to do and more. Granted I had a hard time imagining a similar situation in real life, but in today's world, my imagination has been sorely stretched by real-life events so I was able to accept the storyline. Bottom line, I'd recommend the movie, at least as a rental."
1,The Voice of Kiefer Sutherland is not Enough,All we hear is the voice of Kiefer Sutherland. Kiefer is good but he can't save this movie that is played out in very bad taste. Every other word seems to be a four letter word. It made the movie very uncomfortable to watch. What a shame because the idea behind the plot was very good. Children should not watch this movie.
4,Phone Booth,"I thought this movie was excellent. It was very different from all the other movies out there now. And the script kept your attention to see what would happen next. The twist at the end, made it worth while."
4,"Well, hell. I really liked it.","Phone Booth has gotten mixed reviews, ... but ..., I really liked it. Yeah, it could have been cut, with perhaps the saved time being used to develop further the relationship with the mistress [hopeful] and with the wife. But still. I was on the edge of my seat each time that creepy voice on the other end of the line chuckled and commanded the poor guy to reach for the gun overhead. Although the tension was high, the end was predictable - but if for nothing else, the movie is worth watching just for the scenes with the hookers who want that guy OUT of the phone booth.Four stars."
1,OPERATOR?? HELLO?? HELLO??,This was an absolute waste of time and money. I could have written a better script with half a sheet of paper and a crayon! I am just glad that I rented this and did not pay for it at the movies! Rent or buy something else.
1,"lets face it, this movie ...","it started out as a good movie, but it had no variety..the entire time this guy was in the phone booth, talking to this killer..who you already knew if you paid attention to the first part of the movie..it all became very boring, the commentary is better than the actual movie, its clear what this movie was getting at..but it had no variety in doing so, and i think thats why i was so dissapointed."
3,"Not horrible, not great","Considering that 99 percent of this movie takes place in a phone booth, it's not bad. But, considering that I had to sit there for two hours and watch Colin Farrel standing in a phone booth, it's not great either. Colin Farrel plays a womanizing PR exec who cheats on his wife and treats people like dirt 'cause he thinks he's better than everyone - and, on the unluckiest day of his life, he stops at a phone booth marked by a sniper with a chip on his shoulder. Now he must do everything the sniper tells him to do, including tell his wife that he was ready to sleep with another woman (Katie Holmes) - or else he will be shot dead. If you're looking for an amazing film, this isn't what you're looking for. It wasn't a waste of time, but I've seen a lot better. Not a dvd I plan on owning."
2,"Starts with a bang, ends with a whimper","So this is the movie that was so controversial that they kept postponing the release date over and over again after the shootings in Virginia and the Washington D.C. area. Well... Perhaps that was justified. But the problem with this movie is that you don't like the main character, you don't like the villain... In fact, none of the major characters have anything that makes them remotely interesting. Colin Farrell does a poor Bronx accent and is either trying too hard or not trying hard enough... it's hard to tell at times with his performance. The ending is disappointing and extremely anticlimactic.All in all, it's not a tremendous movie and I would definitely not recommend it to my friends and family."
2,"Fascinating Premise, Poor Presentation","Despite the critical boos, I've wanted to see ""Phone Booth"" since the previews first started popping up in movie theaters last fall. It looked like a truly unique film; what exciting opportunities the claustrophobia of a phone booth offered to the filmmaker who could take advantage of it. Unfortunately, the finished product offers little pay-off. The script barely scratches the surface of the situation; every character and plot twist exists simply to back the premise: a guy stuck in a phone booth, a sniper aimed at his chest. Nothing in this movie makes any sense outside the play-universe of Hollywood. The cast consists of some very talented actors, but they have little to work with. In short, ""Phone Booth"" is one of the more disappointing films I've seen recently, mostly for what it fails to deliver."
4,Not too shabby,"I must say, all in all this movie was pretty good. My expectations were half and half. The commercials made it seem interesting, but the fact that it was directed by Joel Schumacher kind of turned me off (man, the 3rd and 4th Batman movies were awful). Upon seeing it, I liked it quite a bit. It's very suspencful and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Granted, parts of it dragged (and the call girls in the movie were down right annoying), but overall, I really enjoyed it. No, it's not the greatest movie of all time or anything like that, but it is entertaining and definately worth checking out."
3,hmm,"I thought this film was interesting to say the least I wont repeat the plot as has been done above I will only mention that this film has a similar footing as 'Liberty Stands Still' both captors by a sniper. Phone Booth was a very good concept, I just felt that it was lacking in some areas, Katie Holmes character although showing that Colin Farrell was tempted did little else and I think was wasted."
3,Get off the phone buddy!,"Phone Booth Colin Farrell is a suspensful thriller and of course more than half of the film is based aroung a disturibing phone booth call. Kiefer Sutherland supplies the creepy voice as the caller. Katie Holmes isn't the worst actor in this movie, the girl who plays Farrell's annoying wife, jeez she deserved a Razzie Award for that over-the-top performance! Forest Whitaker doesn't get to show his acting chops and by the end you never want to make a call again. This film is a mixed bag for me."
2,Another Kid movie,This movie is supposed to be another action packed thing. But its more like a 2 year olds scary movie. This guy goes in to a phone boothe at a time given and if he puts down the phone hes gonna get shot. Theres this big red dot that stays on him all the time so if he puts down the phone hes gonna get shot.
2,What da heck?,"Just wanted to add my two cents and say-what da heck? The end was a wierd, artsy twist that had me scratching my head and looking panicked and confused as Colin Farell looks like through most of the movie as he saves hookers and their pimps from death and repeats kooky sentences like some modern R rated Fortune teller. Good thing the movie was a short snap of time. That was the high point of this film, imo."
2,"Interesting premise, but","OK, the previews looked really cool, the premise sounded great, but there was only so far this could go and it stretched itself thin.It was entertaining enough to see once, and Colin Farrell is a decent actor, but I can't imagine seeing this twice, at least on purpose. Definately a rental, can't recommend owning it."
4,Phone Booth,Phone booth was a great movie hardly no negatives at all great plot great acting I would give it 4 stars.
1,I felt trapped watching this waste of time.,So Colin Farrell is trapped in a phone booth for three days - well at least it seemed that long. This has got to be one of the lamest excuses for a thriller since waterworld. Maybe they should have put in a couple of gotta go to loo jokes to hightlight the absurdity of this dud.
4,"Not the best, but good","I thought this was a good movie. The acting was great,(in my opinion, Colin Farrell's best performace.) The plot was too predictable though;it reminded me of the movie Joy Ride(especially the ending).If you liked this movie, I recommend the movie Joy Ride."
3,Mixed Emotions,"Phone Booth is one of those movies that make you think what you would do if you were in Stew's position. However, I found the movie not to have any ups and downs...I had the same emotions throughout. I thought the ending was kinda strange, but good, and I thought Colin Farrell did an excellent job.It's a so-so movie and not one i plan to rush out and buy."
1,2003 Mazda Protege5,WARNING: These do not fit this car even though it states it. They were too big so I had to return them. :-/
4,monster and girl in white panties,This is a sequel to the Monster of the Black Lagoon. To me it is not as good as the first movie. the scenery in the first movie made it much more mysterious and compelling to watch. It is time for a remake of the original. I applaud the camera men and producers of the time. I think they did an excellent job with the limited special effects of the time. At one time in the movie they made the creature to be a peeping tom. Why do these monsters want our woman? This puzzles me. Is it for the same purpose as the monsters in Hummanoids from the deep. Later monster movie buffs.
4,Shoulda done it in 3D,I've seen this movie in 3D and that's how it was meant to be seen. Too bad they didn't keep it 3D. Other than that the film is much better than the average monster film of that time.
3,"Not ""TOTALLY AWESOME""","I now know not to believe the ""Customer Comments."" The comment for this movie is obviously so fake and intended as a promotion. What an insult."
1,KISS/Crue REJECTS,"I thought Bruce Kulick was bad in KISS but his work with UNION shows he is only worse by himself. And Motley Crue reject, John Corabi, shows he never belonged in Crue and only belongs with someone as pathetic as Bruce. Save your money and buy KISS/CRUE albums without them on it."
2,Romantic background music,"Although not a classic album, this music compilation creates an excellent background for snuggling or for a romantic candlelight dinner for two."
2,Prefer the BX-10,"Although this is a great product, my biggest turn off was that certain low frequency weren't passing through the unit. So when I was playing a song the bass line would sound weird. I downgraded back to the BX-10 and love it."
4,great film of this genre,"This is a sequel that is just as erotic as the original. This is one of the best films produced by surrender cinama, To bad the main characters in this movie did not have the ability to make people make love as a special power. In femailien I, kara uses this power to create some very hot situations..That one is also great"
3,toned down sequel,"the first one was OH so hot. this one, there aren't quite as many sex scenes, which is all the first even had going for it. the ones that are there are hottt, so i still give it 3 stars, but they're softer than the first movie. so i suggest get the first one (on dvd, it might have deleted scenes that are even hotter, but check on here. amazon, being good people that they are, tell you things like that)"
3,Fem 2,I had read some reviews on this before my purchase and I guess Ibought this one since I had bought the first one and liked it.I didn't enjoy part 2 as much but it was worth adding to my collection never the less...
3,Soft porn Femalien with a plot!,"A definite sequel to Femalien, but at least to go along with a bunch of sex there is a plot. I found it to be entertaining in a good B-Movie kind of way."
2,Not enough Amy Lindsay,"I checked this one out, because I'm an Amy Lindsay fan (she is credited as Summer Leeds in this one). It is a low budget flick, it has decent T&A, but not up to the standards of classic T&A movies like The Great Bikini Off Road Adventure, or Beach Babes From Beyond."
1,Bad Acting...Hot Stars,"I must admit that I am a guy and that I bought this movie before seeing it. I was not shocked with the horrible acting, but was surprised with the hot stars. This movie had both hot guys and girls. The actor that caught my eye was Steven Albrecht ""Freddy"", he is so hot. We get see him completely nude showing off his hot body. He did a great job in his breif scene. Josh Edwards ""Trian"" was okay to look at too. As for the actress...Venesa Taylor is also hot."
3,Not so harmonized,This is one of their better CD's. It's not so harmonized and enhanced like some of the others. It has some translations on the inside for the literal meaning of some of the songs which is nice for those who don't speak Navajo.
3,Entertaining but not comprehensive,The language/tone/ style of the book is really fun and esasy to get but it's not a comprehensive/ elaborate book..Do not expect full information on everything but you can read for fun and a brief summary of the topics..
5,My humble opinion,"I am currently expecting a baby... due in early fall. I find this book very pragmatical(obviously written by a guy). I think it is perfectly described by its title, it covers the daily tasks... it tells you how to manage your baby. It will get you through the day but do not purchase it if you are expecting and insightful book on your baby's intellectual and emotional development and ways to stimulate him/her and so on. Great for first timers!"
3,"Good Information, Gets a Little Tiresome","My wife gave me the Baby Owner's Manual for our baby shower. I like the male-oriented tips in it, some of them are fairly useful. I don't care for the way it stereotypes men as people who won't read a book unless it is in the format of an instruction manual. In my case, I find manuals to be a bit dry, boring and repetitive. My sister gave me another new-dad gift book, ""Keeping the Baby Alive till Your Wife Gets Home"". It's pretty wacky, but funnier than ""Owner's Manual"", and a lot more human. As far as serious baby guides go, I read sections of my wife's books--that seems to balance things out for me."
4,hysterically funny,"This is a good, amusing break from the super-serious tone of most of the how-to books available for new parents. Buy it AND the What to Expect books and you're all set for anything your baby throws your way."
1,Only suitable for gag gifts,"Bought and immediately returned after skimming the first few chapters. I'll give the authors credit for trying to convey actual information and not degrading the role of the father by implying they can't do anything right (as many books aimed at mothers will do), but it's just as degrading to the father to have everything about the baby referenced as a machine/computer part."
2,Very gimmicky,"This book would make for a nice ""joke present"" for a baby shower, but it should not be considered a true baby reference book. It's simply too superficial and gimmicky. Think of it as ""baby book lite."""
2,Not as good as the others,"I don't think this is nearly as good as the authors other book The Action Heros Handbook. It's okay but I have a bunch of other baby manuals that were more helpful and much funnier. I didn't like the drawings. I think it would have been better with real pictures of babies like some other baby manuals have. I was disappointed, thought it would be better."
1,I really can't stand this book!,"This book really bugs me. Okay, we get the ""joke"" -- it's a baby ""owner's manual"" -- hardy-har-har! So every chapter you're forced to wade through ""baby owner"" references and ""baby as an appliance"" asides and quirky stylized blueprint diagrams.There may well be good info in here, but the concept wore so thin after about three pages, I couldn't pick it up again. Let me sum it up: this book is not at all clever, funny or enjoyable. It made me throw up a bit. One star."
1,Soldier Boy,"I dont know what the other 30 people who reviewed this book thought was so great about it. I couldnt even finish the first chapter. It was so dull, boring, and frankly a pathetic attempt to be a ""hip writer"". I wont lie, it had some good information, all of it common sense. I have 2 kids and I got it for the first one. It was a huge waste of money and time. I still have it, probably because I cant just throwing it away. Maybe I'll sell it on Ebay to some other pathetic fool."
1,Objectifies Babies as if they were not already....,"This book does not help in bonding or understanding your new baby. Our culture is very successful at objectifying babies, young children and women. And this book is written in that vain. An important part of parenting in the early days and weeks is the establishment of a connection between the parent and child. The child, willingly waits for the adult to come to them with love and understanding that says they are important and that they are wonderful yet small members of the human race. We all have yet to take a stand regarding the objectification of women and children in our society."
3,Lightening fast delivery!,"A scarce few days went by before this book arrived in the mail. That's what I call service. The book is cleverly written. When I gave it to my niece, she commented that she had received the book from a friend and they had so much fun reading it. Recommend as a cute general read, not as a reference for raising a baby!"
3,Lacks information,"After purchasing the Pregnancy Instruction Manual and enjoying it, I decided to buy the Baby Owner's Manual. However, I was disappointed. It lacks a lot of information I would like to know. My husband likes using this one. I think the compactness of it suits him. We also have the What to Expect the First Year book and I'm certain the volume of that one intimidates him. However, I prefer the latter as it has more information and I need all I can get!"
4,Entertaining and Factual,"The Baby Owner's Manual takes a quality journey into the world of being a new parent. Much of it's common sense but if you give the book a good read you'll have a good laugh, and get some quality information that will likely make your life easier."
5,Love it,"The book is an entertaining way of looking at parenting and is fun to read since it makes the effort of putting everything into a perspective that us people who have never had children, and can appreciate a no nonsense manual such as what you get with a manual for your electronics."
3,so so,"quick not too detail and simple, good to read in 20 min- 30, I do like the charts at the end, book might b hard to read since is all compress so you need to open it and hold it"
3,Great Gag Gift!,This book takes a comical approach to parenting with its illustrations and diagrams. Much of the information inside is useful and nicely laid out by subject matter complete with index for quick and easy reference. Nothing too spectacular as far as information goes; nothing that couldn't be quickly obtained with a Google search. It is kind of fun to read and takes a relaxed approach to walking you through the basics. Great for new parents no knowing where to begin; especially for dads as it has a little humor that may keep him interested.
4,Love it!,"I love this book. I saw it at a friend of mine and flipped through it so I had a good idea of what I was buying. The Baby Owners Manual is written as instructions on how/what to do with your new one in tow. It's impersonal (baby is referred to as item in stead of cute and cuddly), which makes me laugh, but I could see that that's not appreciated by everybody. The overall information in the book is worth it's weight in gold, there a lot of tips and tricks and encourages you to think ahead and for yourself and not to go overboard with trying out a ton of stuff. The tips and tricks in here have worked for years and they'll work for you as well.Good luck!"
5,A great book to keep next to the crib,"This book is simply entertaining; at the same time it provides useful information on the care and feeding of your new baby. It is not intended to be, and is not a comprehensive guide to parenting. It provides a simple to understand guide to ensuring the well being of your infant. It was the only child care book that I could read from cover to cover.Moms, if you expect dad to understand the ins and outs of your new baby make sure to get this great book into his hands."
5,For my nerdy scientist friends...,"It's funny, quirky, and the perfect gift for many of my friends who just had a baby and are looking for something ""different"" than the usual books on how to handle a baby. A few of them actually keep the book close to the iPhone and iPad User's Manuals!"
5,Very cute,"I bought two of these for family members expecting and was very pleased with the copies I received. The information is presented in typical manual format (similar to a tech/electronics manual - with diagrams and all), but it is true and valuable information about baby. As a computer geek, this was the perfect gift to give - and everyone wasn't surprised to get something like this from me. lol"
3,"Ok, others better","I got this baby book because it looked funnier and less overly sentimental than most, and it was, kind of. The whole book is kind of a one note joke about your baby being a piece of equipment, funny in theory but gets tired kind of quickly. The information included is overall good."
3,fun to read the first 2 pages...,"The book explains everything like it is talking about a car, it's fun the first pages but then it can get distractiing and confusing, but the information is generally good."
4,Quick Read,"Had this done in a few hours, it had some great advice and kinda dumbed down the whole baby thing and made it entertaining. I am giving it to my husband to read and hope it will make him feel better about being a first time dad."
5,Good Baby Guide,"Product took about a week longer than expected but it came in perfect condition, literally right in time for the baby shower."
2,"Ehh, not super impressed","I think this book is for the major geek. I love the way it's laid out and the design is super cool. My husband and I just couldn't really get into it. This is our first child and we were looking more for a book with lots of useful information. This is pretty bare bones when it comes to a newborn baby. It's less informational and more, ""this is how to keep your baby alive."""
3,Shanice makes a nice comeback with this new LP.,"Although I only gave it three stars, it is a pretty good album, but not anything spectacular. One thing it lacks is collaborations, which are big these days and better material and music. Some of the more outstanding songs are the released tracks, ""Yesterday"", ""When I Close My Eyes"" and ""You Need A Man"". Some of the others are ""Fall For You"", the smooth ballad written/produced by Babyface, who also shares backgrounds w/ Kevon and Marc Nelson. ""You Can Bounce"", a very uptempo track and ""Fly Away"", which has been touched with that ""Babyface magic"" as well. There are other nice tracks, but those are some of the better ones. Shanice voice is remarkable and really shows it on this album, but the material can become old very easily and isn't anything to different from what you are used to. Nice album to have, but shouldn't necessarily be on your top 10 list."
2,this CD is very DISSAPOINTING,"I HAVE always been a fan of shanice and love her style so when I bought her new cd I was very excited.Unfortunately the cd is not very good as I found just 3 OF THE SONGS REALLY WORTH LISTENING TO.Where is the shanice I knew?,come back!!I would advise anyone going out to buy this cd to be prepared for a not so great cd.WELL MAYBE IT'S JUST ME BUT I PERSONALLY DON'T LIKE THIS CD VERY MUCH."
1,It is Okay,"I am not sure that I am listening to the same self titled album from Shanice that all the other reviewers are commenting on, because short of the first couple of tracks and maybe even ""You Can Bounce"", the album really misses the well anticipated mark. For all of the talent Shanice possesses, the material is weak and non-captivating. Maybe one day she will get her talent and material to conglomerate successfully."
1,THIS WAS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!,"Her last album, ""21 Ways to Grow"", which is now out of print, was way better than this sorry attempt at a comeback. The only 3 songs worth listening to are the first 3 cuts on the album. I am so sorry that I ran out and bought this much anticipated album. Shanice is very talented, but once again, the type of material she has been given or that she has chosen DOES NOT reflect her true talent and musical abilities. Shanice wrote the song ""I Love You"" for Keith Washington's most recent album (he sang duet with Chante Moore) and even that was more the style of music you come to associate with Shanice, not these thrown together half-grooves on her current album."
4,EXCELLENT ALBUM,"Recently i bought Silk ""Tonight"" Tlc ""fanmail"" Ruff Ryder's ""volume 1"" Mariah Carey ""The Ones"" Total ""kima kiesha and Pam"" Inoj, eminem, and others, and this is THE BEST CD I THINK I EVER HAVE BOUGHT IN MY LIFE. Her voice has definately matured since her ""i love your smile"" days. Allthough shanice attempts to hit vocal landmarks Dominated By Mariah Carey, Shanice's High Notes sound Much more as a squeal !!! WELL, ALOT LIKE A SQUEAL ! if she could get rid of the notes on 2 or 3 tracks, this cd would be the best cd around. all together its an awesome cd !"
5,Excellent Album,"Once again, Shanice has delivered a beautiful work of art on this CD...Her particularly strong ballads are Yesterday, Fly Away and A reason...And in terms of style she is able to pull off a great job on the uptempo songs (Doin' My Thang and You Need A Man) as well...She is able to effortlessly display her vocal range, thus, she has the vocal capability and maturity to be groomed for divahood...However, her agents and record label need to do a better job of promoting her...It would be a terrible shame if they did not..."
4,Underrated Shanice has the power to stand with the best,"Although this album peaked at #56 on Billboard and she had a Top 15 hit with ""When I Close My Eyes"", Shanice remains underestimated and has for years. Her fourth album 'Shanice' is one smooth sail through R&B/Hip-Hop Soul waters from top to bottom, with nothing too fast, binded together by Shanice's bold and full voice and personality. The rainy first cut ""You Need A Man"" (co-written by Montel Jordan) is the highlight; Shanice pleads with a woman to keep away from her man. Other strong points include the Babyface ballad ""Fly Away"" (where she demonstrates that her vocal abilities are up there in Mariah Carey's league), ""Somebody Else"" and ""You Can Bounce"". Shanice is not just a vocalist or a diva, she shows a great deal of attention to her music and one would hope it won't be too long before the next."
4,This is Shanice- grown up and talking about the real issues,"I really like this CD. I had to get used to it, but once I listened to all the songs I could identify with a lot of the issues she talked about. Shanice has really grown up from ""I love your smile"". She is really a lady talking about the problems a woman faces in this day trying to be a woman. She is really showing the world what she is all about and I like what I am hearing. If she was getting more airplay and better promotion, I think her album would blow way up, because no mistake, it is a good CD. Teirra D. ATL, GA"
4,Simply marvelous but needs to be promoted,"This is truly a work of art. The only thing missing, like many others have said, is the backing of the label. I believe that if Shanice is promoted the way that the Whitneys and Mariahs are promoted, her album will reach the top. Shanice proves that you don't have to take it all of to have what it takes to make it. I love Shanice (not because we have the same name), but she really needs to stick to a style that works for her and I think this style is it. Fans get confused with a new style per album. The only reason I give this album only 4 stars is because I know she hasn't reached her potential in the music industry. Her voice on this album is lacking that tenacity."
5,"Excellent album, beautiful voice!! Deserves 10 stars! *****","This is one of the best albums I have bought in a long time! With nice pop songs like ""When I Close my Eyes"" and beautiful love ballads like ""Yesterday"" and ""Fly Away"", Shanice displays her beautiful, strong voice. This is MUST BUY!! Great job Shanice! I would give this album 10stars if possible!"
3,It's OK,"This CD has a few good songs, but it is not one that I can listen to without skipping a track or two. However, Shanice has a dynamic voice and she sounds the best on the ballads."
5,This CD will Catapult her to her TRUE status..Megastar,"This is the best CD yet, Shanice has always been talented....Now the rest of the World will finally see What a real singer can do. Thank you LaFace for Recognizing true talent and putting your energy into this great talent!"
5,A Broken Wing Takes Flight,"This is an excellent studio recording from the frequently prolific later period of Chet Baker's career. He is in fine form & accompaniment here playing a repertoire including two infrequently performed standards. Although his vocals are felt to be an acquired taste by some, I find that his fragile delivery can have quite an astounding emotional impact, and the sole vocal here does not disappoint. His star managed to shine despite significant odds, and for those interested it should be noted that another excellent recording titled 'Live At Nick's' documents a live session around the same time period and sharing some of this setlist. I might also mention that the sound quality is quite acceptable. Highly recommended."
5,Chet didn't miss,I am a listener not a critic. I either like it or I don't . Musically speaking I often don't know why I like something.To me Baker hits it with this one.
3,Beck Arnley air filter,This is my first experience with this brand. The air filter I received is not the same as the one in the picture which looks more like OE. The real one is made in China. I am somewhat disappointed but will give a try anyway.
1,Stolen bike,"If I could give this lock 0 stars I would. Yeah, sure, the lock looks great and it comes with a bunch of spare keys, which now that my bike has been stolen means I have no bike and plenty of keys.I only had my bike for about a month and a half, it wasnt a super nice bike (Giant Escape 2) and I always locked it up with care (through the front tire, frame, bike rack and if I could stretch it, back tire too) and then one day when I got out of work, my bike was no where to be seen.When I bought my bike a a local shop one of the employees had recommended this lock when he saw me looking at a larger, heavier and more expensive Kryptonite U-lock. Now I regret not buying that U-lock, if you are getting a lock for a bike worth keeping make it a U-lock, and make sure to get one with stolen bike reimbursement."
3,OnGuard 5029 Cable Lock - OK but not a precision mechanism,"This is the 6ft. coiled bike lock. It came with 5 keys but no lighted key as was advertised. If you think you need a lighted key, look elsewhere. I bought two locks and neither had a lighted key. The lock work is not precision; it feels sloppy, not smooth. Every 5th time, the key refuses to turn and has to be re-seated. Also, the key is not reversible so you may spend extra time fiddling with trying to insert the key into the cylinder. The lock seems sturdy enough and the bike mount seems well crafted. It's worth the $15 I paid for it, but not much more: I'll use it for awhile then throw it away and buy a Kryptonite cable lock... the one I should have bought in the first place."
4,An excellent teaching tool for use with second graders!,"My eight year old daughter and I decided to use a week of snow days to learn a new skill...multiplication. This video provided a straight forward hands on approach for the student learning basic math skills. Although it is no frills, it does provide ideas and examples for a hands on approach to understanding the concept of multiplication. The teacher provides more than one way to approach the problems. Sample math problems are provided and time for the viewer to practice are provided. My daughter was able to apply the information learned and within two weeks is multiplying one, two, and three digit numbers. Explains the crucial concepts clearly. A good foundation before students practice math facts by rote memorization."
4,Hairever scalp treatment,"I am using this treatment to assist in getting rid of springtails on my scalp. If you don't know what that is, long story. I use this product daily and it helps with the aroma of menthol. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that the consistency is so runny. I have already used a ton of it because of this reason. I have started mixing it with T-Sal as a base so it will go further. Other than that, I love it and will be buying more."
4,Mastering Witchcraft,"This book launched my Horticultural career. I became intrigued with the info but had to look up all of the unfamiliar plants, many medicinal and historical. The book is good but lists some inaccuracies for 'Bronze-Age' Wicca such as the use of iron for Sacred Knives. Great source of homemade incense."
3,"A fun book for inspiration, but not for reliable information","This book is not for beginners -- not because it's hard, but because it is full of bad history and contradicting information. It's not something to read when you're first starting out because it conflates Wicca, NeoWicca, and witchcraft with each other.I personally love it, though, because of its value as a vintage witchcraft book and an inspiration for spells. It includes curses, bindings, love spells, and is full of different useful tidbits. Any historical claims this book makes, though, should be researched with a more academic book, so it might be very confusing for someone who doesn't already know their stuff. It's a fun addition to any witch's library, and has been useful to me because it contains many different spells and charms.If you're looking for an introductory book to Wicca, though, look elsewhere. Try the old standbys, Gardner, Valiente, Buckland, etc."
5,Blast from the past!,My son HAD to have this - he lost the CD from when he was younger. I forgot how funny it is and entertaining.
5,"This will put the funk in your trousers, for sure!","For those of you out there who thought ""Musical Barbeque"" was a blast, then you are in for some more unbelievable antics and tunes from the Space Ghost cast! These tunes and tidbits are catchy, and will keep you in a good mood (although you may be irritating everyone around you! Oh well!) all day. Especially funny are Brak's Italian lessons and Space Ghost's attempt at rapping and rhyming. You must buy it. Don't wait!"
5,All Hail Brak,"Funny Funny! A worthy sequel to musical Bar-B-Que, This CD has all the songs I wanted on Musical Bar-B-Que. And If anyone out there is mad about Cartoon Planet being shoved to 1:30 Sunday mornings, E-mail me and we can talk.BRAK LIVES!!!"
1,Listening to this was an ordeal,"I was subjected to this release on multiple occasions by a co-worker. I found it to be not amusing, clever or entertaining, I found it instead to be a painful annoyance, much like a shreiking baby, fingernails on a chalkboard or dental drills, any of which I would prefer to this.This is the Muzak in my Hell."
5,Fantastic Journey,"Betty Elliot goes back to the primitive Amazon tribe who murdered her husband and four other missionaries. She lives with them, with her three-year-old daughter, for a year. She laboriously learns their language (altho her daughter learns it quicker). She isn't sure that she is particularly the better human being."
2,The continuing naivete crisis....,"Why can't these poor indigenous tribes just be left alone? Why all this proselytizing? So they can become shorts- and t-shirt-wearing indigents who hang around Westernized settlements? They had beliefs of their own, for heaven's sake!"
2,I did not like this,"I've been a hardcore Nirvana fan for the past three years, and when I saw this DVD for sale I had to have it. Once the package arrived, I put it in, and after about 45 minutes of it I was highly disappointed. I expected interviews from the band, video, and some music. What I got was still images of the band. The only interview I actually enjoyed was from Kurt Cobain's grandfather, Leland Cobain. If anyone is wanting to learn more about Nirvana I'd suggest biographies or 'Journals', not this DVD."
1,this dvd sucked do not buy,i love nirvana. this dvd is crap. No one from the band had a speaking part or even a silient video part. There is only one 5 second clip of a nirvana song in the whole movie and the woman's voice who does the comentary is super annoying. Do not buy ever even if you want to own everything nirvana. Don't even take the risk to steal this thing. It sucks sucks sucks. They should be sued for making a missleading doucumentry and using five seconds of a nirvana song without the rights they didn't even get the nirvana font correct. this sux worthless
1,courtney love is why,"I am posting this, in response to the reviewers complaing about the lack of Nirvana songs and/or video clips in this documentary:You need to know something first! You need to understand why there isn't one Nirvana song or video clip on this DVD. It's because Courtney Love doesn't like the British guy that is doing this documentary. So, Courtney didn't authorize ANY Nirvana songs or video, to be on the DVD! If the Producers of this DVD put a Nirvana song or video in this documentary... THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SUED BY KURT'S KILLER (Courtney... for the Nirvana Newbies out there)!The documentary is un-authorized, by that (...)"
1,Load of Krap,"First of all, below is my own personal opinion not affiliated with anyone or anything.This DVD does not contain any interviews from band members. I bought this because it sounded like it contained 'previously unseen' interviews from the band, but there is none. No wonder Kurt killed himself. Anyone who spoke to him once in their lifetime comes out to testify and analyze their encounters millions of years ago, probably for a sum of money. What a pity when everyone pretends to be your best friend to ride on the success wagon. It makes you hate human beings.I have to say, though, that the background music sounded pretty good (it's not Nirvana. According to the other reviewer, it's from Earwig.)"
3,OK - but beware - no Nirvana music!,"I have quite a few titles in this series and find them interesting viewing at a bargain price.BUT THEY MUST BE SOLD WITH A WARNING:Please note that ""Nirvana: The Untold Stories"" was created without the participation of the members of the group and features no music or performances by Nirvana.If you want to hear some stories by those that knew them while listening to generic Nirvana-inspired music, then this is probably worth your money - though I would prefer to have a real pressed DVD rather than DVD-R."
3,untold stories,"All in all this is a good dvd if you don't know much about Nirvana already, though some of the facts aren't quite correct and you never see or hear nirvana...you see a few pictures but thats about it. The people interviewed don't really have much to do with Kurt or Nirvana, apart from his uncle chuck, If you just want to find out some facts about Nirvana or Kurt I suggest looking on the web, just search using google you'll get a broader veiw on everything. But it's an ok dvd, and tells you a few thing you won't find many other places and a better view of Kurts childhood and teenage years than on most websites. (If you are having trouble finding this dvd buy i at play.com they have some in stock.) So all in all i say buy it if you have a few quid/dollars spair just to give you better knowlege of Nirvana. :)"
5,Has ANYONE seen this video?,"I dont get it, is it like sold out forever er what? where can u find this movie? if anyones seen it reply please (the only reason i put 5 stars is cuz you cant leave that field blank, i havent actually seen the movie)"
4,A Group with Musical Range,"This CD includes a musical offering with range--classical riffs and ballads. The guitar work is solid and the lead singer's voice is full with range. The ablum opens with ""World's Edge"" that's a synthesis of classical & theatrical rock. At times it will remind you of Guns N Roses. Ballads like ""Those Lips, Those Eyes"" and ""Don't Go Away"" offer a reminscent moment for those who enjoy lyrics. My personal favorite though is ""Empty"" because it just plain rocks!"
3,A Bit More Puzzling,"The mystery in this book was a bit more complex than that in George's first book in this series: the solution was not as apparent. Unfortunately, there were so many secondary characters that it was hard to keep them straight. It was obvious that these characters were there to act as ""red herrings"".I also thought that the coincidence of Lady Helen being on the scene of a murder, and intimately involved, was a bit of a stretch, but was able to accept it with just a grain of salt.George did a fairly good job of giving us more insight into the main characters (Lynley, Havers, Helen, and Deborah) and fleshed out their backgrounds quite well.I thought that the last third of the book was far too dragged out...I found myself skimming a lot."
4,What a Team - Havers and Lynley,"Havers and Lynley are the best Detective Team out there as far as I'm concerned. They are so opposite, but they work. It's nice to see that Havers takes charge a bit in this book. This is a fine example of an English ""cozy"", and I liked the tight plot and the story was good too. Ms. George usually has two or three main storylines going at once, and this book is no exception with two, and she has a talent for fully developing both as she gets through her story. She's an excellent writer, and I really enjoy this series. I can't wait to read another to see how the relationship between Havers and Lynley develops. I hope to see more of the talented Miss Havers in the next books."
3,not as good as her,other books .I was forcing myself to get through it.Her other books were much better ...i will try another of her books and see what happens
3,Love this author,I love reading all these books by Elizabeth George. The only thing the seller sent me a preview copy. That wasn't great. It had misspellings and other errors. Some times I had to guess what was trying to be conveyed. But the book is great.
3,Not as good as others...,"I have read 8 or 9 Lynley/Havers novels and have found all of them, with the exception of this one, absolutely wonderful. There suddenly appeared a subplot which was a surprise to me, and the characters with their peerage titles plus English names were difficult to keep separate in my mind.However, the relationship of Tommy Lynley and Barbara Havers remains fascinating. They are both excellent investigators and supportive of one another and their skills. To me, seeing Barbara Haver's mother before her total decline into Alzheimer's was interesting. You could visualize the downhill spiral she was beginning and the later books showed this.Although this was not my favorite book in the series, I do have 3 more waiting to be read. It certainly won't stop me from being a huge fan."
2,Starts as a real dog,"Other than obnoxious rich people fighting and actors whining about a murder inconveniencing them, nothing happens in this book for at least the first two hundred pages. It's enough that I nearly tossed it to the side without finishing it, but I like DS Barbara Havers and thought I'd stick it out for her. When things finally started to pick up with the Hannah Darrow plot about halfway in, an okay read started. This isn't the strongest novel. One star for the first part, three stars for the second part, gives this cold then not quite hot book a two star total."
2,hard to get into the book,"It was a tedious read, and I didn't finish it. I rarely don't finish a book but I didn't finish this one."
3,so-so at first,"Started off too much like an old Agatha Criste who-done-it, with everyone gathered in the parlor while the had to account for their whereabouts at the time of the murder."
4,PAYMENT is a good read,"I always enjoy a well written tale about ""the yard"". The play between the Inspector and his Sargent keeps the interest of the reader. . . even when the pace slows. Only a few authors capture the English feeling in their stories. . . Elizabeth George does very well."
5,Most Honest Book Ever,"I think this is the first time I have ever read anything about music, hip hop, rap, politics and race that was so straight to the point! Thanks!!"
5,Zakk Rocks!!!,"The solo in ""Cry Me a River"" is worth it alone.I like BLS, but sometimes the fact that Zakk plays most instruments means the whole cd is overdubbed and lacks true spontaneity(sp?). Pride & Glory is a real band with a southern rock feel and this album has a lot more soul that only come from musicians feeding off each other. A must get for any Zakk fan!"
2,Overrated. Where are the hooks?,"Look, Zakk rocks. I've followed his entire career, so when I say Pride and Glory is weak, I mean it. The southern rock twinge is actually pretty cool and Zakk plays some nice solos on the softer tunes on CD. But it always goes back to the same thing for every artist--SONGWRITING. It's just not good here. Too many tracks sound alike and the songs are just thrown together. Track 5 is OK. Rest is mostly filler. Nothing you will remember 5 mins. after you change the CD. Sorry Zakk, but it sounds like you threw this together in 1 drinking binge weekend. Good move to kill the Pride. Now if you want good acoustic and blues from Zakk, get BOOK OF SHADOWS. It blows away this lame effort. Pride and Glory should only be purchased from the bargin bin. ROCK ON BLS"
4,A great start,A very good album. Most of the songs have a great guitar and rhythm . The production is very good and the solos are esay - listening that makes this cd to be listened at any time. It is full of songs and it takes 74 minutes from start to beginning to finish this album. The sound of the vocals reminds me Pear Jams singer . The music is something between rock and metal with a good quality. i recommend this album to any guy who gives a lot attention to good playing and likes rock.
2,Doesn't work,"Sorry, this cd just isn't all that and I went and bought it based on the fact that I love Book of Shadows and read the reviews. BLS earlier stuff is awesome, and I'm into skynyrd and allman bros. and other southern rock as well as heavier music so I thought I'd like this. I don't, it doesn't work. Zakk's singing on this just pushes me away, or not sure what it is but the cd sounds like he wants to be Bob Seger - which IMO is NOT a good thing. Get Book of Shadows, which is excellent, or if you want other mellow metal from Zakk - Hangover Music Vol 6 blows this one away too."
3,Top notch rock and roll,This cd has some truly top notch rock and roll with some obvious guitar and writing skills evident. Some of the non rock tunes have merit as well but dont suit my personal taste making my opinion on them irrelevant.
4,Birth of a new generation,This Cd is among Zakk's best. It continues the Black Sabbath legacy while establishing new directions for Iommi and Rhodes' heir.
2,Everyone please stop mis-leading people w/ 5 stars!!! It's about 2.5,"Look, Zakk rocks. I've followed his entire career, so when I say Pride and Glory is weak, I mean it. The southern rock twinge is actually pretty cool and Zakk plays some nice solos on the softer tunes on CD. But it always goes back to the same thing for every artist--SONGWRITING. It's just not good here. Too many tracks sound alike and the songs are just thrown together. Track 5 is OK. Rest is mostly filler. Nothing you will remember 5 mins. after you change the CD. Sorry Zakk, but it sounds like you threw this together in 1 drinking binge weekend. Good move to kill the Pride. Now if you want good acoustic and blues from Zakk, get BOOK OF SHADOWS. It blows away this lame effort. Pride and Glory should only be purchased from the bargin bin. ROCK ON BLS"
3,Very diverse,"Zakk Wylde (usually guitarist in Ozzy Osbourne's band) have a thing for country (which Ozzy hates...) alongside with his love for distorted heavy metal haze (which Ozzy loves...). Forming a three piece (hobby?) band, called Pride & Glory, enabled Wylde to perform anything he wanted as well as handling the vocals. While some people would say that Wylde and his Pride & Glory have more than a touch of schizophrenia, others find this diverse approach rather appealing. The album includes real chaotic heavy metal-like tunes in the shape of ""Horse called war"" as well as country sounding stuff like ""Cry me a river"" and ""Sweet Jesus"" - two very good songs. I believe this album is worth checking out either if you're a real metal head or a modern country fan."
4,Great Album,"Get this album, It's different, but F--king awesome. Im not a fan of Zakk's ""BLS"" except for a few tunes but his work here is great. If you like his Book Of Shadows cd, you will really like this one. Stop Reading, BUY IT, TURN IT UP, And ENJOY.."
4,Nice and light for the summer,"CK One is an outstanding scent for the hot, humid summer. Light, long lasting, and not overpowering. Great for shorts and a t-shirt as you hang out sucking down cold beer."
1,Worst Cd Of '99. If Not Of All Time!,"This is just plain garbage..no good lyrics..the beats are corny as they get!It Sounds like your riding on a ferris wheel at the carnival!Clown Music from a bunch of losers!No Rap Style. Plus Mase Isn't Even in this group!and Baby Stase, Blinky Blink, Huddy Combs, Loon, Meeno & Suga J can't hold it down by themselves! They have no skills Combined! Cardan should have been in the group permanentely. This is trash!Don't ever buy it!"
3,ok,"this CD is not all that, but I give it 3 stars because it's worth it for about 3 to 4 tracks alone, especially I Really Like It, that song takes me back to the 80's because of the New Edition sample and it gives me a blissful feeling."
3,"IT'S ALRIGHT,BUT ""HARLEM WORLD""WAS BY FAR BETTER.","WHAT CAN I SAY BUT THIS CD IS HAS A FEW GOOD SONGS LIKE ""I REALLY LIKE IT"" BUT IF YOU LIKE MASE GET HARLEM WORLD BECAUSE THAT CD IS 5 STARS. YO MASE U ARE THE BEST RAPPER EVER I CANT WAIT TILL YOUR NEW ALBUM COMES OUT."
1,WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY!!!!,"I AIN'T FEELING THIS COMMERCIAL ""RAP"".This cd isn't for those of you of that who are down HARDCORE RAP, the beats, the rhymes are weak. Them not writing their own lyrics remind of manufactured bands like the BACKSTREETBOYS and don't belong with thug poets like NAS and freestylists like BUSTA RHYMES."
1,I'm sorry but this just isn't what hip hop is suppose to be,"They got people writing their lyrics for them and you can't feel them. Don't that sound kinda phony to yall. Now I'm not saying not to buy it, I'm just saying it's not my cup of tea...to commercial for me, just not real."
2,"DO NOT BUY THIS CD, it is the BACKSTREET BOYS of RAP","Its obvious that with the fairly common samples used in this cd, that commercialism and mase and pratcially synonomous.A good effort to make cash of the younger less understanding generation of urban youth. I think it will sell, but when the smoke clears it has SOLD OUT and SOULED out. No originality makes this a disgrace to the hiphop nation.BUY EMINEM!"
1,commercial rap,"This album is going to be garbage,because commercial rap is garbage.Where are the real Mc's?"
2,this is one of the worst rap cd's i've ever heard,"i liked mase harlem world so i got harlem world the movement and i love mase but this cd is just boring the tracks arent that good and ""i really like it"" got really old real fast. the best track on here is probably the one wit jermaine dupri. i mean come on mase what happened the last cd was the bomb! i was seriously disappointed in the album so dont buy it."
3,Dont let the Featured Artist fool you,You got Nas and Kelly Price but this album isnt really all that I like that song I really like it and Were both Frontin but the other stuff isnt all that but ok to listen to out of curiosity but if you like Mase and Loon you'll probably enjoy this.
5,Who Sings What Verse....,"In reply to one of the comments below, I would like to point out that in the 'I Really Like It' video Blinky Blink sings the first verse as the artist Cardan, who sings the first verse on the album is no longer with the group.All Out, All out"
1,This is not worthy to be called an album!!!,"Okay, I'm a make this short and sweet... This LP SUCKS!!!!!!!!!! Big Time. Don't waste your hard earned dough. Go get a Wu-Tang album. Thank You."
1,horrible,"This is the absolute WORST album that i've bought, i wouldn't even define it as ""hip hop"", its just plain, bad, materialistic rap. these MCs (if you want to call them MCs) lack of good lyrics and flow. What was Mase thinking? You should not waste your money on this, if you want a sample of the album, listen to the real audio clips that amazon has provided. Pure trash."
1,This isn't even Harlem street....WEAK!!!!!!,This album from harlem is the wekest rap album I ever heard. I knew they wouldn't last. Look at the rap scene now..where are they??? Dropping another single??? ..I doubt it. They were only in it to make a quick dollar. They had 1 or 2 good tracks but it was still weak. Mase didn't even do as good either but he went platinum. Maybe next time if they even try to come out again..They will really learn how to rap and not just imitate. Blinky blink and cardan is the only ones who could rap out of that bunch...the rest was wack. This is the weakest rap cd I heard in a while ...ever so buy at your own risk.
2,Let's face it: These cats cannot rap,"In fact, they suck. Yes, including the slowest rapper on earth, Mase. Their some of the worst rappers in the world. I could rap better than them. Why did I give it 2 stars, instead of none? Because of the the catchy chorus and instrumentals in ""I Really Like It"" Otherwise, the album absolutely sucks. THEY SUCK! SUCK! SUCK!"
3,LET'S DANCE!!!!,"This CD has slammin beats, all this CD is supposed to do is make us dance. As we all should know its not real Hip-Hop, there lyrics are very weak. but what the lyrics lack the beats make up for. I like Harlem World, Mase, Puffy, and etc. because I like to dance, but all of there lyrics need some real work. If you can't see where I'm coming from just listen to the CD by Black Moon titled War Zone and you'll not only hear real hip-hop but you'll feel it also. Enough said the CD is worth buying but no rush is necessary there will always be some on the shelf."
1,Pointless!,"God, why does this dmb commercial rap exist!To the fans of the commercial rap, you know who you are, next time you listen, try to get past the beat if you can, and actually listen to the pointless dumbass lyrics. To those who like this whack sh*t you are as dumb as their lyrics are."
3,I couldnt tell which rapper sang which verse?,"what i said up there they should tell you who sang in the song for example, in the all out video blinky blink was the firstto sing and he sounds like a robot but on the cd he sounds nothing like the video."
5,OK....,"THIS IS NOT MASES CD, ITS A GROUP CALLED HARLEM WORLDS CD, MASE IS IN ONLY 1 SONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"The Man Show, Great show, lousy DVD","This DVD is CENSORED, CENSORED, CENSORED!Simply put: The only reason anyone would want a DVD of the Man Show is to have it uncensored and with a lot of episodes. Seeing as there are only 10 episodes in this set (and that they are spread over 3 DVDs for some reason) and that they are CENSORED (Yes, no nipplevision for you!), there is absolutely no reason to buy this at ANY price. I loved the show, I'll admit, but I expect no censorship when I buy a DVD. If they release it uncensored (a costly and time consuming process), I'll maybe buy it (I've seen the full thing, just in case you think I have no idea of what I'm talking about.)Buy this only if you feel like being disappointed"
3,These are the televised PG versions.,"Before buying you should be aware that these DVDs contain *exactly* what was shown on the air - including blurring out strategic body parts. The shows are extremely funny, and worth owning, but don't expect a ""unrated"" versions of the shows."
2,Love the show - disappointed by the DVD,"Gotta say, I love the Man Show, which is why I got the DVDs. The first season is not as great as the rest, but I thought it would be worth it.I was disappointed. The video quality is poor and the editing or censorship done for broadcast television, is still there.The extra clips were nice."
5,It is like Oprah...but for men,"When a show panders to women is is called sensitive and thoughful. When a show is geared to men is called sexist and vulgar.Okay The Man Show is vulgar and sexist. It also happens to be funny and reasonably clever in it's sophmoric humor. Which is far better than most of the programming that is not sports geared for men...well the clever part at least. The first season of The Man Show is solid and if you can just let that egalitarian new age guy out for an evening you should be laughing and getting a few guilty pleasures.It is too bad Fox went to the big bar in the sky, but his drinking chant lives on."
3,good,"man show is great, but i didnt think the first season was the best. i wish there were no visual censers. extras were pretty good. wish there were more episodes than 10, but for the price its pretty good amount. would give 3.5 if there were half stars.whoever released this dvd was too cheap to pay to use songs. Not sure if the names are right but ""She's a lady"" and""Allstar"" were two of the songs I noticed that were replaced with crappy ...music."
4,"Semi-uncensored, but not the best way.","No more bleeped-out words in this version. All the colorful language (well, there's some but not THAT much) is heard in all its glory. Still a wonderful show, and I hope Seasons 2-4 will be forthcoming.Obviously Comedy Central had to bleep out certain language and mosaic over the brief nudity. But so far the language is uncensored for the DVD but the one instance of nudity remains strategically covered. No big deal, really. Most of us are adult enough to not get all googly over a pair of you-know-whats. But it is an interesting ""partial uncensoring"" nonetheless.The DVD extras are only mildly interesting, but the content as a whole is still worth the expense."
5,A Masterpiece,"I have enjoyed these songs for decades, and have finally replaced our worn cassettes with the MP3 version. Michael Card is truly gifted in his way of putting Scripture and reflections based on Scripture to music. The Life and the trilogy from the Old Testament (The Beginning,The Way Of Wisdom,The Word) are my favorites of all he has done, but I enjoy all of his music (I have almost all of his albums in some form or other).If you enjoy The Life, you might also want to check two more recent albums from the Gospels:Luke: A World Turned Upside DownandMark: The Beginning of the Gospel. I gave these each 5 stars. I would give The Life and the Old Testament trilogy 6 if I could."
3,Fairly standard collection of covers,"This is a CD with noble intentions, but that for the most part fails to capture the magic of Blonde on Blonde. Most of the tracks are by-the-book covers of the Dylan songs, not much to grab one's attention. The second half is somewhat better, but still not terribly inspired. The only real high praise I can give out is for Clarence Bucaro (a woman), whose version of One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later) is the only real standout on the disc. She is the only one who actually *did* something with the song, rather than just regurgitating it. Overall, an enjoyable collection for a real Dylan fan, but not much new."
2,IS THERE ANY OTHER SINGER AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET?,"I guess not, and maybe that's the reason the Young Brothers keeps Brian Johnson under their payroll. There are a couple of good songs here, a good sound production, good booklet. Bu the singing...oh My !!"
1,You've Got To Be Kidding Me!,"I can't believe that some people actually consider this to be a good album, let alone one of AC/DC's best. Give me a break! Is there a worse song in their entire catalog than Hail Caesar? I certainly don't think so. The Furor? C'mon! I've been a fan since '78 and I recall when I saw them on this tour, that I sat behind some teenagers who stood up for the Ballbreaker songs, but sat down for classics like The Jack. What a society we live in. I don't know where I was going with that, but anyway, DON'T BUY THIS CD! Is that subtle enough?"
2,Embarrassing stuff,"I just bought BALLBREAKER for like $1.25 on Amazon, and I can see why this is selling for such a low price. There isn't much diversity in the song selection and about every song is between 4:00 and 4:30 minutes and aren't very different from each other except for maybe the first song on the cd. The songs are really stupid sounding and just are embarrassing. I'm kind of afraid to give the cd STIFF UPPER LIP a try because the song ""Stiff Upper Lip"" sounds like some of these songs do, and believe me, I don't want that. The only really blockbuster album they ever made was BACK IN BLACK and that was a long 26 years ago. I think that AC/DC really needs to think about hanging it up, and I think you Amazon customers should think about passing this one up.P.S. I just gave the extra star because it's AC/DC."
1,This is just horrible,"I hate AC/DC, I don't care how far back they go, they are just bad. Maybe I could look past all their inadequacies, if it wasn't for one, single, terrible aspect. VOCALS! PLEASE! I've heard everything from death metal to opera, and I can safely say that these are the worst vocals ever. If you are gonna growl, then growl, if you're gonna sing, than sing. BUT DO NOT DO WHATEVER YOU ARE DOING! Make it STOP"
2,Not another idiotic AC/DC album...,"AC/DC has plenty of good albums: Dirty Deeds, Let There Be Rock, Powerage, Highway to Hell, Back in Black, Razor's Edge... Ballbreaker is not one of them. That said, it is better than the crap 80's discs Flick of the Switch and Blow Up Your Video. That's not saying much, but they manage to squeeze two-and-a-half good songs out of this one: Furor and Hail Caesar for the good, plus Boogieman has a cool riff though it's pretty much a rewrite of the much-better Night Prowler. The rest is just more idiocy... it's about time they changed the mid-tempo rock with dirty lyrics formula and tried something new. Come on, haven't we heard Cover You in Oil, The Honey Roll, Burnin' Alive and Love Bomb on all those crap 80's albums? (Or even the classic ones?)"
1,terrible!,"this was a wasted effort. Burning Alive and Hard as a Rock are worthy of a listen, but the rest is truely embarrassing. Please save your money."
3,Just another album,"Another medium standard album being released by AC/DC. I enjoy their older stuff and had great expectations, but was somewhat disappointed in this release."
2,"Hard as a Rock was really good, but...","The only song I REALLY liked was ""Hard as a Rock"" The rest were OK."
4,A strong CD that is overlooked,"Ballbreaker is their most overlooked CD, imho.It is simple:(1) If you like AC/DC, you will like Ballbreaker, and(2) If you do not like AC/DC, you will not like Ballbreaker.(3) Buy it if you like AC/DC. Listen to Barry Manalow is you don't like AC/DC, for her fits your style, obviously."
3,"Good, fun album","No matter what you can say about this album, it's fun and rocking, and has catchy choruses. The production is different to what you'd usually expect from Classic rock, but that doesn't stop it from being quality rock music. There's plenty of amsuing stories like 'Ballbreaker' and the vocals are gruff and playful."
3,A half step in the right direction...,"Featuring their original drummer,this 1995 effort finds AC/DC exploring older musical avenues,but the corny lyrics will require an effort of patience from the listener."
4,AC/DC,"I'm only giving this albumn 4 stars, because I like about half of the albumn. AC/DC is phenomonal, but a lot of their songs sound the same. If you like raspy-voiced loud, thick rock- you'll LOVE AC/DC, and this albumn."
2,"""Burnin' Alive""? You're not kiddin'","AC/DC hits an all-time low with this painful album. Brian's voice is great here, but it just never seems to change! The problem isn't with the voice; it's with the guitars! I thought the Youngs could get a little more creative than this piece of garbage. ""Hard as a Rock"", ""Ballbreaker"", and ""Cover You In Oil"" are the only tunes I care much for. The rest all sounds the same, and the songs just have the same theme to it. The lyrics have nothing to do with anything but sex! It gets annoying hearing a 46 year old guy talk about having sex. I'm sorry; I can't stand this one after ""Hard as a Rock"". Don't buy it!..."
3,Not that great,"Everyone seems to hate Ballbreaker, and to be honest there's nothing here that really jumps out at me. Ballbreaker and Hard As A Rock are alright. If you like AC/DC, then go ahead and get it. If you want to see what AC/DC is about, get a better album."
2,Ac/Dc Ballbreaker,"I never had been a big fan of Ac-Dc, I brougth this album, and don't fill the expetative of what I consider a Bam Gruop. I only can give 2 star to this album. The best song in this album are: BALLBREAKER, of course... and HAILCEASAR. The other song are the same of the same.I can't tell to all of you, that not to buy it, you can, but to your own risk..."
4,Very underrated album,"While not as good as The Razors Edge, Ballbreaker is an excellent album. I don't understand the negative reviews, most of the songs on here are excellent. ""Hard As Rock"", ""Cover You In Oil"", ""Boogie Man"", ""Hail Ceasar"", and ""Ballbreaker"" are all awesome tracks. The only songs I don't like on here are ""The Honey Roll"" and ""Caught With Your Pants Down."" A must have if your an AC/DC fan! You won't be dissapointed!"
5,awesome ac/dc,"AC/DC is my son's favorite band, and this was by far his favorite birthday gift. ""Totally rad!"" says my 8-year-old Bon Scott fanatic. He says, ""It is the best band in the universe!!!"""
3,Solid,I struggled with 3 or 4 stars....went with 3 because even though I am a huge AC/DC fan I don't find myself searching this album out or digging up the tracks to play. That being said - there are some very good songs and if you can get this used or as a download I would pick it up.
3,NO BIG DEAL,"The great news here is the presence of Phil Rudd aborard drums once againa, after a spell of twelve years. Other than this nothing. The album is clearly inferior to "" THE RAZOR'S EDGE"" ( altough superior to ""STIFF..."", where Brian's voice seems to have quit at last !! ). I'm not complaining about three chords, same formula, etc, etc. THis is not the problem. The problem is that the creativity to combine those three chords is clearly weakening ... Anyway, I'm suspect to say so. Maybe I'm alittle bit angry with the fact that the band came to Brazil only once ( 1985 ) during their glorious career ..."
3,Back to the basics,"This is the first album that AC/DC has put out in the last 12 years where they can remember their roots... bluesy-metal. Brian Johnson can finally get his vocal chords to cooperate again and Phil Rudd is back behind the drum kit. Songs like ""Honey Roll,"" ""Whiskey on the Rocks,"" and ""Cover You in Oil"" remind you of the suvvern style playing of their '70's work. Bon Scott would approve!"
5,Great music,AC/DC strikes again! What a cool album. Have it on a playlist that is played in my vehicle quite often!
4,BALLBREAKEEEERRRR!!!!,"I like the AC DC albuns in the early 90's...Both, RAZOR'S EDGE and BALLBREAKER are full of great songs!!! By this time, AC DC are playing a more calm Hard rock, instead of the fast crazy heavy rock of their beginnings...AC DC will forever be one of my favorite bands!!! Thank you, AC DC...For being part of my life!!!!!"
2,AC/DC=Great Band Ballbreaker=Bad Album,"AC/DC is my all time faviorite band, no questions, hands down. They have great albums like Highway to Hell, Back in Black, Stiff Upper Lip etc. But this album plain out blows.. There are no memorable tracks except hard as a rock.New to AC/DC? BUY BACK IN BLACK2 stars for Hard as A rock (Awesome song)"
3,Lacks depth,"It's one of the worst albums they have. Brian Johnsons voiceis shot on this one. He sounds better on ""Stiff upper lip""and that's nearly 6 years AFTER this album. The strongestsongs are ""Ballbreaker"" and ""Hard as a Rock"" and the albumflops after that."
4,Four and a half,"This album is a great rocking album. It dosent quite have the same feel as the earlier albums, but there experiance in playing is defnitly showing on this album!The only reason i dont give this album 5 stars is because it did not include the great single to the Last Action Hero soundtrack ""Big Gun""! When Bruce Fairbarin passed away (Razors Edge Producer) the looked for a new producer and found Rick Ruban. they decided to do a test song with him and it was ""Big Gun"" and that is one of AC/DC's greatest tunes ive ever heard them do! and it did not appear on the next album :(To this day Big Gun can only be found on the LAH sountrack, and if your lucky enough to find the single... or do that thing that record companys dont like you doing involving the internet :)"
4,"Just like Evil, Thrash Never Dies","Get Thrashed is a documentary on, you guessed it, the phenomenom that was and IS thrash metal. Now it didnt really tell me anything I didnt already know about thrash, but it was very enjoyable to hear the music legends talk about a genre they obviously cared alot for. One drag was that I had to listen to bands like Shadows Fall, Corey Taylor, Lamb Of God, and Hatebreed give their opinions. But it wasnt a big distraction form the overall film. They interview every band you'd think should be in there, and the bonus features covers any they missed, with the exception of a few,(Demolition Hammer). All in all, I enjoyed this film alot, and am glad to have it in my collection."
5,"A ""must own"" for thrash fans","A thorough look into the thrash scene of the 80's. Well, as thorough of a look as you are going to get in a documentary in 2008! Even as someone who lived through the time in Florida, there was a lot of interesting information that I never knew about. In the main documentary and in the extra footage they hit just about all of the major thrash bands of the time. I definitely enjoyed seeing this and recommend it to any thrash fans. My only negative opinion of it is that they should have covered its evolution into death metal as opposed to nu-metal (which is what they covered instead)."
3,I love Kim's energy!!!!,"I still like ""Cafe Racers"" and ""Voyeur"" which to my mind have better songs, but this one is still, like all of Kim's albums, interestingly varied. I like the bonus material, a bare bones, raw demo re-do of Little Steven's classic ""Forever"", and English new wave group Buck's Fizz weird Europop ""I Am A Camera."" ""One Kiss"" sounds like something Stevie Nicks would have come out swirling her skirt to in the 80s and it's transition from minor verse to major chorus works well for Kim. ""Begging for Favors"" is so 80's video you can almost see the wet back alley and dry ice smoke and spikey haired sax player as you listen. Give it a spin for a return to Kim's heyday!!!"
3,An Ok Album,"Not Kim Carnes' best cd,but not her worst.It contains the hit ""Crazy in The Night"".The other tracks are really nothing special.A rip off of ""867-5309"",and some other so so material.It contains my favorite Kim Carnes track ""One Kiss"".If your a Carnes fan and dont have this in your collection,then i say buy buy.If you want her best than buy Voyuer or Cafe Racers."
2,Perhaps for a new teacher,"I was disappointed in this book as it was just a list of items needed in a classroom. I think it might be useful for a brand new teacher, but as a veteran teacher I found it boring and useless for me. I ended up selling it to someone else."
1,"Cheap cloth, missing pieces","Good morning,The person I purchased this '10 pc Queen Size Ivory Sunflower Print Bed in a Bag Comforter Set w/Curtains' was very disappointed. She infomed me that the material was of very cheap quality, 3 of the 10 items were missing, the important one being the Comforter and 2 curtains. I will rethink before ordering from this online service via Amazon.com - merchant visiondecor.com. I hope the missing items will be sent soon, this was suppose to be a surprise X-mas gift for 2005. I would not even consider giving this a 1 star but as no 0 star option was available, one is forced to use the 1 star rating.Disappointed"
1,WARNING: Waste of Money,"With 22 years of mechanical experience, I found this book to be poorly organized, was severely lacking in schematics and illustrations, and tended to describe procedures only half way. It seemed at times that the author was not even fluent in English. This book will only add frustration to the job. Look elsewhere."
1,Tries to cover too much and doesn't cover enough,"By trying to cover 21 years of engines and the full range of sizes, this book is very short on the details. It is very lacking in useful schematics and specifications as well as step-by-step procedures. One would do far better to get the Honda shop manual for the specific model outboard you have. I found this totally useless as a reference. Perhaps it has a value as an historic overview of Honda outboards. Nothing more."
3,Necessary for repair,Purchased for a fried who was having a problem with his outboard.Manual was hard to read as it had too much information not pertaining to his particular motor.
3,Good manual,"The manual has many descriptive details, but it is not practical.Overall good.Il manuale ha molti particolari descrittivi, ma è poco pratico.Nell'insieme buono."
5,Lovely!,This book is lovely! I can't wait to start reading it in December with my kids and add to our family traditions with new stories!
5,One of the most important books I have ever read!,"I have read many books and this one hit home on many levels. Dr. Kreeft used a simple way to show us why prayer is important, how powerful it is, and how even busy, distracted people can make a habit of it for Life. I will read it over and over!"
2,Not really for beginners.,"I think Peter Kreeft is a great thinker and writer. But be forewarned. If you are a person looking to begin a prayer life or you are a person looking to bring more meaning to your prayer life, I WOULD NOT suggest this book. At the beginning the book reaches out and grabs you with its potential. But as time goes by may become mired in lots of philosophical ""if then"" statements.My thinking is that most people buying this book want some help. They are looking for a ""how to"" book and this is not that book. A better book might be Prayer Primer by Fr. Thomas Dubay.I'm sure there are some that will get much out of this, but if you are a beginner to both prayer and a Christian life, you will find this book a problem."
2,"A more accurate title for this book would have been ""Why Pray?"", not ""Prayer For Beginners"".","A more accurate title for this book would have been ""Why Pray?"", not ""Prayer For Beginners"". It starts out promisingly, but then, as another reviewer commented, it is more about why to pray rather than offering instruction on how to pray. I was hoping for practical advice, but found an apologia instead.For example: ""We are already wholly his by right, but because of sin we are not yet wholly his in fact because we do not wholly will what we are by right. We are thus not wholly what we are: we are not in fact what we are by right.""Get Kreeft's other prayer book instead, ""Prayer: The Great Conversation"". That one contains a number of practical suggestions."
5,For readers of all theological and religious backgrounds,"Non-sectarian and non-dogmatic in its approach to universal faith, God Is For Everyone is a powerful testimony to the rich rewards of a spiritual life. Describing God as an ever-present, ever-conscious force that all can tap into, it offers insight into promoting mutual respect and understanding among the religious traditions of the world. Written for nonspecialist general readers of all theological and religious backgrounds, God Is For Everyone is a life-affirming treatise steeped in the wisdom of Paramhansa Yogananda and his disciple, J. Donald Walters (Swami Kriyananda)."
5,An incredible deal!,"If you go to a food store, you'll pay 2 dollars for 3 or so unpeeled garlic bulbs. Here you get over a half pound of peeled and ready to use garlic cloves, packaged professionally. Why spend all your time peeling garlic (ugh, what a nightmare), when you can just purchase them from TasteOfThai. Shipping is incredibly reasonable too!"
1,Not Really for ALL Compaq IPAQ Series PDAs,"This item was meant for the older, larger model iPAQs. My model 1935 was swallowed up by this huge case. I am returning this item for credit. I hope I also get credit for the shipping charges. Of course I am out the cost of paying to return yet another item that did not indicate that this case did not fit ALL iPAQ models. Hopefully, I will end up with some credit. I am disappointed with Amazon.com. I haven't had this much trouble in the past. Two out of the three accessories that I bought for my iPAQ 1935 did not work. I bought the iPAQ Pocket PC from Amazon.com. Live and learn."
1,Negative Stars,"When I received this case, my first thought was that the pachage had been in a poorly cleaned or ventalated area. Then I cut the sealed pack open, and discovered that my initial impression was far too kind. The case was filthy, covered in a gritty textured something, with dark banding on the edges of the metal, as if it had been scorched. The CF card holder looked streached out of shape, as if it had been used. The whole impression was of a used, damaged, piece being repackaged. Only the fact that it was in one of those plastic packs you need a plasma torch to cut through makes them think it was not. I now suspect it is salvage of some kind, perhaps from a warehouse that was flooded or burned down.At this point, I am returning it for a full refund."
1,Buyer beware! wrong size!,"If only I had read the previous reviews before placing my order! This item will not accommodate an IPAC 1930. As a frequent customer, I hope that Amazon will honor its return policy. This experience is all the more frustrating, since Fellowes does not appear to list an equivalent case for the smaller IPAC models."
3,"Decent, but not the series' best.","Brian Michael Bendis, Powers: Anarchy (Image, 2003)Welcome to a world where regular, everyday mortals and superpowers coexist side-by-side-- and, unlike most such worlds, there are a whole lot of people with superpowers in this one. Bendis and artist Mike Oeming pose the question of what such a world would be like, and for the most part, they've given us quite a satisfactory answer.Anarchy, the fifth Powers book, hands us a string of murders of Powers, and a detective squad who can't make heads or tales of it. Finally, they go to the one person they think can get a handle on things: Christian Walker, dismissed from the force a year before for giving an interview to the press.If you like the series, you'll continue to. Anarchy isn't going to change many minds one way or the other about the series; it's good, but not great. ***"
5,Nice tea pot,"Chatsford offers something really nice. This tea pot is really good. The handle is in good position; there is enough room that your fingers won't touch the pot. Big infuser let tea leaves have some room to dissolve well and easy to clean the pot. If you drink various type of tea, you should have separate infusers."
3,Very disappointed!,"Despite the interesting and colorful jacket, the music is very disappointing. Most of the music sounds the same. This would not be a CD that I would recommend to others."
2,I would look for a different product,"My first impression of this course is that I wish I wouldn't have spent my money on it. Before it teaches any signs it has a dialogue with a mother and daughter where they discuss the mothers desire that the daughter learn sign so she can speak to an uncle in a family reunion. Then they start off teaching the signs for man, woman, boy, girl, uncle, etc. I would much prefer a traditional language learning sequence where they start with simple things like ""how are you"" and ""my name is"". When they introduce the alphabet they demonstrate each sign once and go through it very quickly. I wish they wouldn't have wasted time on the imaginary dialogue between the mother and daughter and instead they could slow down on the actual instruction and demonstrate each sign 2 or 3 times before they move on to the next one. Maybe the rest of the course will have some value but my first impression is not good. I may see if I can return this and get something else."
1,So very disappointed,"I am learning ASL and thought this would be a great idea to help speed up my learning. I was so very wrong. This DVD is so hard to follow. The two hosts especially and the single guy signing are way to fast and don't slow down. They also didn't cover some of the signs I was hoping to learn. If I could return it, I would in a heartbeat... Don't waste your money."
3,Something to watch.,Not too bad. A little Scripted. Frankly I am in Afghanistan and a show with a bunch of women in not a lot of clothing caught my eye! It is more than that so I give it 2 and 1/2 stars.
2,didn't work for my bichon,"I gave this product a try TWICE. I did not want to try Angel Eyes. My mistake. I gave this two stars just because the sellers were kind. But it did not work AT ALL. If it works for your dog, then good. It did not work for mine. I will choose my own dietary supplements."
5,better than dear abby,"This is a funny, nostalgic and wonderful book. Miss Abigail has a genuine affection for her subject and it shows.Using texts from the early 20th century and even earlier she manages to find bits of advice that you will want to remember:""The more mature girl knows that she doesn't need to resort to either slapping or running in order to deal with the too-amorous boyfriend. She wards off unwelcome behavior with a firm refusal to cooperate, accompanied by a knowing smile and a suggestion of some alternate activity. She may say ""Not now Ambrose--let's go get a hamburger, I'm hungry.""Miss Abigail covers almost everything from going steady to getting married. Even though the advice is vintage it's still good (hamburgers notwithstanding). Miss Abigail is funnier and smarter than Dear Abby and she has better hair too."
2,Shipping problem,"This one is a little hard to rate... the product arrrived on time , it is what I ordered and the Disc's were not damaged. The problem is with the packing of the prooduct. It was sent in an envelope with some half type bubble wrap and mailed through the postal system. When I got it and opened it up the DVD box itself was damaged. Pieces were broken off. The DVD works fine but the packaging was below standard which is why the container was broken in tranist. I stopped using another vendor for this problem. So now I have to rethink if I will continue using this vendor."
3,Bit of a disappointment,"It was nice to get some of these songs on one collection, but I thought about half of the songs were throw-aways. For instance, where is ""Man in Motion"" from ST. ELMO'S FIRE? Still worth having but not as good as VH-1's other 80's collections."
4,He REALLY wants to be Aphex Twin,"I saw this CD on listening display in some store, and listened to it. It immediately reminded me of Aphex Twin, so I bought it (I'm like the biggest Aphex Twin fan on the planet). However, on closer listening, you can tell that he doesn't live up to his mentor (few do, except maybe Tom Jenkinson [Squarepusher], Mike Paradinas [Mu-Ziq], and Luke Vibert [Wagon Christ, Plug]). The songs have great breakbeats, but they're not as interesting any of the above British guys. Some of the ambient pads sound nice, but a lot of them sound too similar, like he only had one synthesizer patch when he was recording. Overall, not bad, but a bit more simple and minimalist than the Aphex Twin that I wanted."
3,Season 7 of TMNT,"The Seventh Season of classic Turtles, with this set containing the European Vacation episodes that were missing beforehand. While this season set has two ways of getting it, a full season set or by four volumes that feature a little toy turtle with each of the releases, which is nice if you want to have a little action figure to add to your collection. Featuring 27 episodes in this season set, with episodes that some of the fans have been waiting to watch prior to this release. I don't get as to why there were two ways of purchasing this season, though it seems like it was just a little marketing ploy that they dished out. I just don't get why they would go about doing that kind of thing to the fans when both should have been released at the same time to give fans a choice from the start. Overall this set receives a 3 stars out of 5."
3,Finally the old episodes,This season is great I recommend watching this before going into season 4 as the first 2 Dvd's take place before season 4 and makes the time placemnt out of whack
1,Too small to read,This book is physically very small with miniscule type. This was not mentioned in the description. I would never have bought it if I had known this. I can't tell if it is any good because I can't read it. This problem is totally unnecessary and is a reflection of a bad publisher.
5,Let the games begin!,"The game is love is a wonderful book about two people coming together when the are on different sides of an issue.Erin cassidy thinks all men who play sports are loud, dumb and all they are interested in is sports and bimbos. then she meets famous football player Tony Hart when his teenage sister smashes into her stainglass window. Pretty soon opposites start attracting. can erin put her veiws about sports behind her long enough to see the man behind the football player? This is one of the first romance novels i read and i have enjoyed it time and time agian."
2,Don't be misled!,"I own the ""Varekai"" DVD and love everything about it...especially the music. This is NOT the same music that is on the DVD. Some tracks are similar, but not even the performers are the same. To get the true soundtrack to the DVD, you have to order it directly from Cirque. I like this CD, but it is not what I thought I was ordering."
5,Fantastic,"I absolutely love this CD. It is very unique and makes me happy. My only qualm is that some of the songs are too alike, but otherwise I really recomend it."
2,Not as expected...,"I gave this two stars because I felt sorry for Violaine Corradi. This is definetely not the Corradi I was expecting. If you want to listen to his better works, listen to Dralion! Varekai is not what I expected from a Cirque CD. I'm very disappointed."
2,i dont know about that,"I really dont agree that this lp/cd rates with tha reo classics we know, REO COW,REO II ,LOST IN DREAM , RIDIN,TUNA and some of nine or hifi . But it is the last release of any merit of the 80-90 's.Just remeber that reo had a classic 70's sound that was the best of the band .LATER"
1,"Oh, let's face it--this album sucked.","I was 15 when this album came out and I lived in the Chicago area--where REO ruled the airwaves and our lives. I remember my excitement when this album finally came out. As I stood in line at the record store, the album art seemed promising as it depicted, possibly, the next morning after the 'Hi Infidelity' hotel room album cover. Sadly, the fun stopped there. The first single, 'Keep the fire burnin' was tepid, but not horrible. It took me several weeks to admit to myself that there were no other good songs. 'Let's be-bop' had some of the bounce that you expect from an REO song, but what 15 year old wanted to 'be-bop' in 1982? With the pop fun of new wave looming on the horizon, REO be-bopped right off the music scene never to regain their cultural relevance or chart supremacy. They did, however, regain some of their tunefullness on subsequent releases. Good Touble? Bad album."
2,Generic and not that good,"If you like 70s REO, then you probably won't like this CD.You can get this as part of the ""Triple Play"" seris (along w/ Ridin' the Storm Out and Nine Live), which will only give you the discs but no booklet (all the discs are not the remastered versions either).I really like REO's 1977 live album, as well as most of their 70s output. I found ""Good Trouble"" to be sappy and very generic. It just seemed like rather bland 1980's MOR-AOR that was catchy at the time but hasn't really held up."
2,More needed here...,"Several areas of this album are lacking and after about 25 years of listening, I think I've figured out what they are. The vocals for one! They are weak and have too much echo. I also think the lyrics are sappy. The actual song structures of the songs on this album are very good and I like the way a real piano carries many of the songs - as opposed to video game sounding keys that were the rage at the time. Also, Richrath's guitar could be a little more predominant in the mix. So, keep the songs the same, just toughen up the vocals (and lose some of the echo), add new lyrics and up the guitars a touch and you have a classic!"
4,An amateur film for hardcore Ferrickheads,"This self-produced biographical documentary of the singer-songwriter Melissa Ferrick covers roughly the 1st decade of her musical career (hence the title). It includes the high and low points of her career, including being dropped by her record label and her struggle with alcoholism. It was assembled and edited by Melissa Ferrick as a gift to her legion of devoted fans. As such, it's a fun biography if you're already a fan of Ms. Ferrick, and it does delve in some depth into the recording process for her 2nd album with Atlantic Records. However, its concert footage is unfortunately limited and truncated, and I wished it had more of the live performances that Melissa is famous for. It also has a ""homemade"" amateur feel which I find charming, but others might perceive as unpolished. 3.5 stars out of 5."
3,the wutang clan is back,"this cd is really good. Starts off great with track 2,3, and 4 probally the best on the cd. Then it kinda gets kinda boring in the middle and picks up again at the end. There are maybe four or five really good songs but the rest are all just fillers and not worth it. I think if they put some more time into making all the songs as good as the first couple it'd be a lot more, this doesn't live up to wu standards."
1,Wackness galore,They lost 99% of their hardcore fans and traded them for 90% of all the 15 year old boys in the world. They can't even come up with a good title or a so called full album!And why all the ... has been guest while ya got a big fam?The real Wutang died 5 years a go.These fancy boys arent real
5,Return to form,"After innumerable disappointing solo albums and the disaster which was the ""Wu Tang Forever"" release, the Clan are back to their best. The Rza handles the bulk of production duties and it clearly shows - every tune holds your attention to the end, the sound is recognisably Wu, hard and simple but there is more of a soulful feel. Worth buying for 'Gravel Pit' alone which is one of the most exciting Hip Hop tunes of recent years."
3,OLD DIRTY IS IN REHAB!!,"Why is everyone crying about ODB only being in one song? He has been in rehab for about 2 years. Notice how on ""MC Conditioner"" his voice sounds a little off? That's because he didn't record the song with Snoop. They just took something that he did a while ago and put it on a beat and had Snoop do something similar for the next verse."
5,"Awesome album, great tracks. Get it","This album is seriously awesome. There's a couple of really memorable tracks on it, but at least 6-7 that you'll want in your permanent collection too. I've recently rediscovered it in my CD collection and forgot just how good it is. Turn it up loud and make sure you have a sub for maximum effect."
3,The W didnt make the Cut for me,"ok this album is decent for its production, but other then that it wasnt that great, truely didnt really care to hear that snoop dogg is on this album, I would still buy this album because im a fan of the wu but really aspect anything spectatacler"
3,alright,i would say this one is ok. im a wu head to death but NOTHING can compare to 36 chambers. but i would buy this album. you cant deny their talents
2,Reviewers are f***ing stupid (2.5 stars),"""Clearly having learned a lesson from the ostentatious affair that was their last group effort, Wu-Tang Forever""What?? Do they even listen to hip-hop? That album is so much better than this, I'm glad there's 2 discs of it. Wu-Tang Forever is a straight Wu banger, The W is where things start to get weird. Why? Cause it's from late 2000, almost 2001 of course, & Wu-Forever is from '97. More or less there's your answer, & the secret to finding & obtaining only the best hip-hop. Not that there weren't some dope releases in 2000, Kweli dropped his classic album w/Hi-Tek - Train of Thought by Reflection Eternal, Afu-Ra dropped a killer album, the D.I.T.C. cd came out then I think. But a lot of rappers were starting to slow down & deteriorate by the turn of the millenium & the Wu-Tang Clan as a whole are one of them. Some of the s*** on here is really weird, & you can tell by the album cover & the guest appearances this just isn't your good ol' Wu-Tang."
2,1 word,"Retire....as a group the only songs I like is Careful, and Do U really, this CD is not good at all and I dont care who gets mad for me saying that I love Wu but this S..t is dew garbage!"
4,A new wu has arrived...,"As a fan of wutang's early work and all the solo's i have to admit that ""the w"" is nothing like they ever did before... That is not to say that ""the w"" is a bad record because is not with exception of ""conditioner (feut:snoopdogg)"" and ""break your neck ( the jump off) "" this disc has alot of tight songs and worth your money! Such songs as ""under one blood"" , ""hollow bone"" , ""i can't sleep"" , ""let my niggas live"" , and , ""jah world"" plus the other sick songs! If your a fan of 36 chambers and forever you will have a hard time enjoying this but eventually it will grow on you, trust me! Don't think twice and buy wutang's the w as well as irong flag, alright ? That album is sick! Wutang will always bring us the real hip hop and not the w is not commercial at all and wutang is not selling out of fallen off!! Wutang is just more famous but still they brought us underground classic hits along with hip hop anthems so respect them and support them ! Peace!!"
5,Classic,"Good album here. Shorter album than the other 2 albums. But worth it. This album gots great lyrics and beats. Careful is a banger by the way. This album seemed more like a throw in album. Not like something they really wanted to put there time into. RZA pretty much produced every track on this album. Plus they had more of a known single called ""Gravel Pit"", another good track. More mainstream sounding. Good though.This album kinda takes you back to 36 Chambers, because it is super grimey. The beats are more dark/grimey, the style that they are good at. So thats a plus. This album might not keep you listening forever, but its worth the money definately. This album is hott thats why im givin it 5 stars.Peace"
3,very underated,"Basically this is the sweetest album if you just listen to it, dont change tracks, its nice backround music for a long walk the beats arent loud and booming there more laid back and everything is very relaxed. Although i wouldnt buy it i got it from a friend its a nice listen once in a while"
4,Finnaly...weve been waiting,I am very pleased with this the latest of Wu-Tangs records finally they have accended beyond the long song with the constant beat rapped by thousands...they mix it up a little more here and i love it. Plus Protect ya Neck is an awsome dance song....thanks fellas it was worth the wait
5,2nd best Wu album,If U thought the WU was over then you were wrong. The W is a mix between 36 chambers and forever. It's got raw beats and good lyrics. Is not as good as 36 chambers but its pretty close. Don't think twice of getting this cd. You'll love the phat beats and off the chain lyrics go get it now don't waste another second.
4,who said wu-tang was dead...?,"I bought this cd yesterday, and the first time I listened to it I felt like ""ok, there are a few lacks on this one..."", 'cause the record seems short in comparison to their last clan effort:""wu-tang forever"". But the great, innovated beats and the and the participation of various artist's including Issac hayes, make this cd worth having..."
3,aint really feelin this,"Dont get me wrong I Love Wu tang but this album is a dissapointment and they are getting worse. Yeah there first two was classics and there solo efforts waa bangin but this nah. Yeah there is some tight tracks ""Redbull"" and ""lets my N-Ggas live"" but thats abotu it yknow, it aint too good, comapred to there debut this aint really nuttin.And thats all I have to say about that"
3,Hmmmm . . . .,"If you are thinking about buying this one, I probably would advise against it. The CD is really not that good and has some really poorly done tracks. Obviously this CD was rushed or the parties involved could not agree on times to come together to put these tracks down. And this comes through in the quality of the sound. Buy something else."
2,Ummmm....,"Wack..... The beats are weak, and no one raps to the beats..( probably cause the beats suck! ) There worste CD I have to say. Don't recommend it. I actually give it a 2 1/2"
3,OKAY PLAYERS,"WHAT HAPPEN TO THE WU. THIS ALBUM IS NOT UP TO PAR AT ALL. 4 YEARS FOR THIS <SH@T>. YO THE ONLY GOOD SONGS ARE CHAMBER MUSIC, LET MY<NIGGAS> LIVE, THE LAST SONG ON THE CD, JUMP OFF AND REDBULL. DO NOT MAKE THIS CD A GIFT."
4,Great! but where's everyone else?,"Ok, I'd first like to start out by saying if you like anything that Wu-Tang has ever done... go buy this album... you'll like it. However, my main complaint with the CD is that it sounds like a Method Man and Ghostface Killah album produced by the RZA, with a whole lot of guests... this isn't a tragedy... Meth and Ghostface are wonderful on the album... but i would have liked to hear more from the other members (especially ODB, too bad he's in rehab...) and the lesser known MCs in the group. When I buy a Wu tang album i expect to hear great interplay between the group and a cohesive group sound... instead it sounds like everyone came in the studio on a different day and made a good album."
2,This cd over all sucks!,I had wu-tang forever and it was so off da hook that I listened to it like everyday. Almost every song was awsome. When I heard this cd I was surprised cuz RZA usualy produces the dopest beats but this was the main problem with the cd. The rhymes were tight but the beats sucked. The best and only good songs are Gravel Pit and Do You Really. So I am given it 1 star per good song.
2,Weak by Wu's standards,"I never thought I could give a sub-par review to an album produced by the gods of hip-hop, but I must say--this is very disapointing. Wu-Tang will always be my favorite, but I don't understand how they spent 4 years making an album with only 13 tracks, all of which would be below average on their last album. RZA is god, and I think it's great that he's putting so much time into all the solo CD's, but this is easily the worst album they've put out. Because it's Wu, it's guaranteed to be playable, and you have to listen to it. But I waited 4 years for this, and if it was any group besides Wu, this CD would be a frisbee."
2,Wheres RZA?,"Wu is my all time favortie group since 36 chambers.They are the best group of MC's ever assembled other than Onyx and N.W.A but this album disappionted me.No creativity at all the two previous albums were masterpieces, works of art, but The W is by far the worst wu-tang CD ever even than a wu-tang affiliated album.Snoop has no buisness in this album niether does redman, issac hayes or nas.Wu should have made this long awaited album a 2 cd because that made me mad also that it was only 13 tracks.Bottom line is drop cappadonna and the MTV style Beats and go to what you know witch is creative beats and great lyrics.And remember MTV ruins hip hops greatestpeace,"
3,where did all the beats go?,"If you know the wu, you know they are known for their crazy lyrics, and phat beats. This new wax is by far the worst wu production yet. there are a few catchy tracks, but nothing like you have come to expect from a one of a kind click, like the wu. Im just saying, I was really disapointed, but you might want to check it for yourself."
4,What do you expect from Wu-Tang?,"In my opinion, this is the second best album that Wu have released, behind the classic 36 Chambers. If you are a fan of Wu-Tang (and how could you not be?) you know what you are getting. Straight grimey beats, hot lyrics, and a sh*tload of talented emcees. All of the members flow so smoothly together listening to these guys spit is really special. No one emcee is above any other, they join together to form one of the greatest, if not the greatest group of emcees in hip-hop. The few guests that include Redman, Nas, and Busta Rhymes drop some hot verses in the songs they are featured in but this album is all about the Wu, as it should be. I don't know what else to say except go and buy this album because it is a great hip-hop album and is what hip-hop is all about.My 3 Favorite Tracks:Gravel PitProtect Ya Neck (The Jump Off)Chamber Music"
4,Wu Tang Slangin' Again,"Starts off a little slow. In the intro we get a very familiar movie clip. Hard core, classic Wu Tang. First four songs take a little getting used to. Look out for Snoop. The middle of the album is where the meat is. RZA and the boys seem to get their flow on pretty heavy. Overall, after only one listen, I really liked the way the album sounded. As usual with this bunch, I'm sure it will take a little getting used to before I discover its true brilliance. Within the next couple of weeks I probably won't be able to take it out of my CD player. Boo Ya!"
4,bling bling!,"The Wu are back.. and this album is TIGHT! First things first, The Clan are back to their roots with great Kung-Fu samples (which I have found to be missing from some of the clan's solo releases).. The style of this album is reminescent of their first, Enter the 36 Chambers, very pure.. great beats, slick rhymes.. no ""filler"" tracks.. After my first listen, I was diggin' track 2 ""Careful (Click, Click)""-- nice style on the chorus, Track 5 ""One Blood Under W (Featuring Junior Reid)""-- pulling some great reggae stylee, Track 7 ""Protect Ya Neck (The Jump Off)""-- quick, fast, & Blazin! , & Track 12 ""Gravel Pit"" - this has to be my favorite track, it's got it all! This is a must of Wu Fans.. and a great addition to any hiphop arsenal!"
4,Excellence revisited,"The latest album of the 'reunited' Wu-Tang Clan is a must-buy for the fans who expect the same straight, morbide hiphop we're used to hear from the Clan. However, those (like myself), who thought Wu-Tang style hiphop is extraordinary music making, testing the limits of the expected and the possible, well, those fans are bound to end up a little bit let down. The W is ... great, but so were the previous albums. A pitty ""the W"" isn't great in a different way."
2,COME BACK OL' DIRTY!!!!!,"I am one of the biggest Wu-tang fans on the planet, and I have listened to everyone of their lp's, including solo efforts. So its painfully done when I admit that I was not immpressed by this effort. I know what the Wu-Tang Clan is capable of, especially Method Man and the RZA, but this was just not worth the wait. The songs sound like they were recorded in a basment somewhere with little digital sound use. I miss the off-key insight from ODB too! He was the glue of the Clan. I speak for all Wu-Tang fans when i say i miss him. However, this album was not a complete failure, the lyrics are still fresh and different from all the other ""Bling-Bling"" (music thats out)... in the hip-hop world. ""The Gravel Pit"" reminds me of the 36 chamber days. The message is still the same. My opinion on the clan is remains unchanged, but I think they could have done a little better on this effort.KOhls"
1,what a joke,This cd is a total waste of money..i bought this thinking i would get the usual wu tang flavour..little did i know i was buying frisbee material..what is snoop doing on this cd..thats what i'm still trying to figure out. Next thing you know they'll have eminem featuring on the next wu joint that drops. Please save your cash or buy 36 chambers
2,simple and weak,"was any effort put into the making this album? it sounds weak and simple, like no one was really into this joint. this album definitely proves that not everything the wu touches is gold. very unsatisfying work from a great group."
4,Almost a classic,"IVe been waiting a while for the WU to come back, all together, and when this came out i was pumped, but it partly disappointed me. Dont get me wrong, there are some great songs here, like Gravel Pit and Protect Ya Neck, but most of the other songs are lacking the old WU energy, the production is even lacking a little, but overall its a good album, just not what i expected from WUTANG."
1,Cant believe the WU created this!,"Do you like the WU's heavy dark rap?, well you wont find any on this album this cd is sad and pathetic. No good songs what so ever. Wu tang went down hill Big! time since there early releases. dont waste your money on this. 0/100 //.gravediggaz 6 feet deep album is the best ever wu related disc!."
1,The W,To make a long story short this was the worst album i have ever heard what were these guys really trying to do.Except for thre two comercial realeases the rest of the album stunk.i wont recomend it
1,This SUCKS,"I have been a Wu Tang fan for years, but this album makes we want to throw away all my other albums just to spite them. Sorry, but I'm not jumping on the bandwagon for this one. After listening to the entire CD, I realized what ""The W"" was all about - more money, plain and simple. I'd say that 2 of the tracks are decent - the rest are complete garbage. The grips on most of the songs are so annoying I'd rather listen to somebody scratch a chalkboard with their fingernails, and my favorite member of the Clan, the RZA, is hardly featured on the album at all, save for a 15 second verse in 1 song. Anyone who has enjoyed the previous albums for the Wu's dynamic rhyme style and catchy grips should not waste their money on this trash. You will be very disappointed. I know I am."
3,THE W,"I'M DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS ALBUM. IT SEEMS LIKE THEY WU HAVEN'T SPENT ALOT ON TIME ON TRYING TO MAKE THIS GREAT. I KNOW THESE GUYS CAN DO ALOT BETTER. THEY HAVE SOME HORRIBLE SONGS ESPECALLY ""I CAN'T GO TO SLEEP"". THE SONGS I LIKE ARE ""GRAVEL PIT"", ""PROTECT YA NECK (JUMP OFF)"" AND ""CAREFUL(CLICK CLICK"". WU TANG FOREVER!!!"
2,What were they thinking?,"What were they thinking when the Wu-Tang dropped this album? I hate to have to say this being a big fan of Wu, but this new joint is a huge dissapointment. Rza's production is off and there are about 3 listenable tracks on the whole record. The only thing that even makes me want to listen to this cd is GZA and Ghostface's efforts to try and save the album. It may be hard not to if your a big Wu fan, but take my word for it...dont pick this one up"
1,Garbage!,I listened to this cd and was discusted! Obviously just another band re-forming for the quick dollar. I havent heard such a bad album since any No Limit CD!
2,The Wu Is Through!!,"I was bored by this album. Is this suppose to be a comeback? Well it didn't work. I didn't like the first single, ""Protect Ya Neck..."", but ""Gravel Pit"" is undeniably banging. There aren't enough songs. 13 songs are not enough for a regular group so why would a group with so many members have only 13? There should not have been any guest artists either. The guests(Nas, Snoop, Busta) outshined the Wu on the album. The music on the album is depressing to listen to because it is sooooo boring. This album is even worst that Wu Forever. Maybe they should keep the name, but stick to solo albums. That way they can work with better producers. Meth has felt success by working with other producers, why do they need RZA. ANyway,as much as I hate to say it, the Wu is through. Stick a fork in them."
4,"Great wifi router, great price!","I would have given this 5 stars had the interface been a little easier and a better manual been provided. having said that, you will want to download the latest manual on buffalo's website which has more detail and is a little beefier than the one provided in the box. this router provides great speed and features. it also supports wpa for better security than wep. you really should consider this router, download the manual from buffalo's website and take a look at the features. you won't find the same capabilities in most other products from companies like linksys for anywhere near the price. especially the firewall and intrusion capabilities. money well spent."
5,Great router for a novice,"This is a great router for a beginner to work with. This was the first time that I had setup anything remotely like this and I have little computer knowledge. The router came with little paper instructions. However, you can download a .pdf file of the full manual off the CD that comes with it. It took me 15 minutes to setup the router and I was up and running. For the beginner, you may want to read through the manual before getting started. I have not had any problems with the router since I set it up and have not had to call customer service. I primarily use a wireless notebook with this and have never been disconnected going around my two level house or even outside."
2,Vice Manager,"I could access its default homepage by using a wired station; however, another wireless station was always unable to connect to the WBR-G54. Two friends of mine who have the same AP already suggested me to upgrade the firmware. Well, the AP finally worked although the upgrade process failed. I do not know how it works. Anyway, it works now."
5,Kim communicates...,Kim Carnes through her song writing and singing really communicates! From the opening of You Make My Heart Beat Faster you know this song communicates a sense of excitement and some desperation. She switches gears for the sad and sorrowful Met You At The Wrong Time Of My Life. Then there is the hopeful I'll Be There Where The Heart Is.Kim says and sings everything so clearly and so emotionally. As I said...she communicates!
2,A Source Book for Writers,"As an ex-english teacher I found the ""teaching"" part of this book confusing. There were definitions for words that didn't need to be defined like incidents or events to help expain what a plot is. This is meant to be a college writing book and these words would have been defined in grade school. The writer suggests looking at pieces of writing and analyzing for mood, setting and descriptions of characters. Although this is not a bad practice that you might employ once or twice a year, it tends to make a person very negative as they read. I do highly suggest the list of writing exercises in the back for a springboard of daily writing practice to hone your skills."
4,the writing of a short story,"why do I like this book? there are no gimm&#8203;icks--what you see is what you get.instructive; yet, delightful to read.Even though most readers or writers don't know me--amazon-can tell youthat i am very honest in my reviews; even amazon gets it--if they don't sell quality.My friends--the only place i buy my books is amazon. Higly recommend the readingas well as the quality."
4,block madness,"An enjoyable,if short, read. Anderson takes on a malevolent entity ... with predictable results. There's a lot of death, some black humour and a strong narrative drive. It's tightly written and minimal room is given for character development or contemplation about greater themes.That said, its enjoyable and good fun. An understanding of Judge Dredd does help.Oh, and to confirm - it's not a graphic novel. Its a short story."
1,decoration,"Unless you are a total sword fanatic, pass on this. Sword is flimsy and dull; I guess it would make a great over-sized letter-opener."
2,fairly average,I will Always give Shelia E.madd props for Her Musical Talent but this Album doesn't do it for me all the way.soft vibe&missing some snap.there are hints of Funk here&there but overall nothing really cooks to me.She does Her Best Work overall for Others&Live to me.but this is another mild Album which hardly to me showcases Her full Musicial depth.
1,Total Hoax,"Watch Out! this is the same bad, low quality and old Review ""Inside Black Sabbath"" of Classic Rock Productions with another portrait and menus...it don't have any interviws with Ozzy, Glenn Hughes, Geezer Butler, or Bobby Rondinelly as Advertised... Sadly just another hoax to cash with Sabbath Fans..."
3,Overly Sweet For My Taste,"I am always on the look-out for dried fruit w/o artificial preservatives/colors or sulfur dioxide. Product was well packaged and I felt the price was pretty fair. I was however disappointed upon tasting the pineapple rings plain as a snack, IMHO the taste was more akin to the candied pineapple one would find in Christmas fruit cake, of which I am not a fan. The sugar content was overpowering for me and did not sit well on my stomach. As a general rule I do prefer fruit w/o added sugar or a light dusting. I tried using the pineapple rings in baking and cooking with limited success including: Pineapple Upside-Down Cake, Sweet and Sour Chicken. Overall, a quality product just a little too sweet for my taste."
5,White on Rice,"Absolutely hilarious movie. Having lived in Japan for over 6 years and having spent 19 years working with Japanese, I saw several people I 'know' in the characters. Those that don't speak Japanese will find this funny--those that do speak Japanese will be rolling on the floor at some of the antics. My favorite line is between Jimmy and Tim: Jimmy: ""My brother in law thinks I'm retarded!"" Tim: ""Why do you say that?"" Jimmy: ""Because he said to me, 'I think you're retarded!'"" Priceless."
4,NICE BUT MISSING NEEDED INFO,"I enjoyed this video but felt there was information for the beginner that wasn't in the presentation. Vital info like meltpoint of the wax for embeds and the best wick sizes for her projects. She did list size for 9"" pie but not for ice cream,rootbeer etc. I was a bit disappointed as this is the info I needing most. Great ideas though. I don't think it was worth as much as I paid for it."
5,Vive La Reine!,"I am already a huge Victoria Holt fan, and this book made me THE BIGGEST Victoria Holt fan!! It is just wonderful, full of romance and suspense and dispells lots of the myths and lies about the doomed Queen, making a fascinating portrait of a young girl forced into an exalted position. Victoria Holt's legendary attention to detail makes this a book that will educate you as well as thoroughly entertain you. Get the Kleenex out for the last chapter! Sad, yes, but this book is completely satisfying, not to be missed."
3,not very instructional,The person in the video is skilled and an excellent artist. In fact he is so advanced that a beginner may have trouble following his movements. He does not do a lot of teaching--he performs demonstrations.
2,Not a training DVD,This is NOT a training DVD. It is a video of a form and that is about it. You would be better off getting something a bit more specific to how to control the three sectional as opposed to watching someone just go through the moves.
5,Excellent introductory book,"Please also read Sawyer's Mathematician's Delight. My last review was more appropriate for that book, as it refers to the infinite series example. But this also a superb book. I like M.D. slightly better because of its narrative bent."
4,Names of God power point,Excellent resource to use in Sunday School and other small groups as well as background prelude for worship service of any size church
2,Misleading and too...,"The tape was mostly lectures from 2 doctors about what schools should be doing to better help kids. There were only a few minutes of interviews with the adults who had learning disabilities. I was expecting longer vignettes with the adults in order to hear more about their ""success stories."" Little time was spent on the ""Portraits of Success."" At the end of the tape you are directed to another site for the obtaining the video containing the interviews with these adults. Given the expense of this video, I was very disappointed in the format."
3,A very technical history,"It is very obvious that the authors, Oliver and Fage, know their stuff very well, that said I found the book highly technical with little explanation for the historical voyeur, making me constantly have to resort to the Britannica to fill out my understanding as they never gave an general introduction for me to hold onto. By chapter 5, this grew wearisome, and I jumped ship. I think if you have a good understanding of anthropological and archaeological terms you would do better than me but if you are looking for a leisurely general overview, like I was, this is not it."
1,"Euro-centric, pro-Christian non-history of Africa. Clarke and Davidson better sources.","This books perceptive can be summed up from a sentence on page 94- ""... from the eight to the fourteenth centuries [Africa] almost certainly gained more from her partial inclusion in the civilization of Islam than she lost from lack of contact with Europe, then passing through a dark age redeemed only by the surviving light of Christianity."" Tragically for Africa and it's people, when the Europeans arrived in Africa, they used Christianity to rob Africans of their land, resources and Independence. Africa was carved up by European countries and have not recovered yet. Dr. John Henrik Clarke and Basil Davidson's books are true books about Africa and it's people, not Africa from a European perspective disguised as African history as this book purports to be."
4,Positive Look at Associations,"You become like the people you spend time with. That is the foundation from which the book is built. Phillips sees friendships as being mysterious in that they are ""rooted in divine providence, because the hand of God brings two people together and a spark of life cements their souls together."" He talks about God-ordained relationships.Phillips is right on target in quoting Robert South, who said, ""A true friend is a gift from God."" Real friends are encouragers. ""You cannot grow spiritually if you associate with people who refuse to do anything but gripe and whine,"" Phillips writes.There are so many delightful, encouraging quotes about friendship in this wonderful book. It helps you to see the value of making relationship cultivation a major part of your life. Right relationships can enhance the quality of life in every way possible."
4,Fasinating and thought-provoking!!!,I'm not sure if I totally understood everything Michael says but it sure made me think a lot. I'm going to read it again. It was very simply written and yet really powerful.
1,A very hard read,"I am one who always strive to finish what I start. Reading this book brought to one of those moments when I questioned whether to continue or not, but I managed to finish and after which I could not understand a thing. I hope to re-read maybe, just may be I will understand it. The problem for me is, it's hard to understand how can I be without any believe!!The point is, to say you believe in nothing sounds like a believe to me. I could understand if it was about ""expect nothing"" but NOT ""to believe in nothing"". If one claims to ""believe in nothing"", that begs the question, is that true? And if it's true then doesn't it imply one's believe in ""believing in nothing?? And if the implication is true, then what does it mean to believe in ""believing in nothing""??The verdict after my first read?? Confusion!!!!"
3,its OK,"Works pretty good but not always, although it eventually does get the lights on or off. Easier to keep than send back."
1,Doesn't Work,Purchased the item for use in our church's Christmas production and unfortunately it did not work properly. Sometimes (2 or 3 times in a row) it worked and then all of a sudden - nothing. Unreliablity caused us to rethink our lighting for the production. I don't recommend this product.
2,Buy A Different Brand,"I purchased this product so I could turn on my living room light before I entered the house. Though it claims it will work up to 80' away, that must be an unobstructed path. It would work 10' away in the house, sometimes right outside the front door if you pointed exactly in the right spot. Very sporadic. If my garage door opener can work a 100' away, why can't they make lamp control work? I returned the product."
5,Very Handy - Works as advertised,"We recently expanded a screen porch and lightly furnished with a few party lights and a lamp. Problem is that at night, there is no switch to turn lights on/off; this is a great fix - and is secure.We can turn the lights on/off from inside the house which is especially helpful for the midnight bathroom run by the dogs.What I thought was an added benefit (didn't know until we already purchased) was the dimmer feature - so we can dim the lights to our liking.This kit comes with one transmitter that is capable of driving two different devices, but only one receiver. Keep this in mind!"
2,Watch Out the Remote may not work,"I purchase two units one single and one double units . The first unit (single wireless outlet) did not work because of a bad battery which I replaced and now it works just fine. I needed another one so I bought a double since the remotes are able to control 2 different wireless outlets . When I received the double unit the remote did not work this time the battery was good but the remote was defective I emailed AMAZON but no reply I hoped they would send me a new remote.Now I have 3 wireless outlets 2 remotes but with only 1 working remote I can only use 2 wireless outletsHeath Zenith is of poor Quality,lets face ZENITH ain't what it use to be."
1,Not even close,"If you need more than 6 (yes, six)foot range or NOT line of sight, DON'T BUY THIS THING. It doesn't perform anywhere close to its advertising claims. or you can have mine ... its going back."
4,relaxing,The harmony among this group is great and the music is very relaxing.I enjoy listening to every song.
1,I wouldn't know,We waited forever to discover that the toy was out of stock. We attempted to purchase it elsewhere with the same result. We may never know how much fun this toy would have been.
5,Great Songwriter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I caught Greg's last appearance in my local area and I was REALLY impressed!For a songwriter to impart those kinds of emotions and feelings is really what his job is all about.This albums has all the feelings you have had and just weren't quite articulate enough to express!It's like a history lesson of the bad times of the Dust Bowl and Depression with the attitude of surviving it and NOT being beat down by it!The musicianship on this CD is also outstanding!!The song ""A Little Rain Will Do""shows that as bad as it got in Oklahoma during those times,the people would rather depend on the kind blessing of their Lord than a Government handout!""A Strange Kind of Night""is the all-too-true story about that night we have all had a nd were afraid it would either end or NEVER end!Greg's lyrical aptitude is amazing! TRY IT,BUY IT and you WILL enjoy it!"
5,A great CD,"I bought this CD at first because of the song ""Good As I Was To You"". My 5 year relationship ended because of the other woman. Now I listen to all of the songs, they all hit home when you listen to them. Lorrie brings out life in her songs and helps you get through your problems."
1,No new songs.,"I had expected to hear new songs sung in the sultry voice and excellent english she has used this year. Instead, the music was obviously recorded long ago in the somewhat screeching voice she used before. Please ask her to record some new songs in the beautiful voice she uses this year."
2,lookin for more nutty influence,"this cd is hardly what i was expecting when i purchased it. you can tell its definitely more influenced by quin, with nutty kinda thrown in. long story short, it sits in my cd rack collecting dust"
