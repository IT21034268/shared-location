4,Pilot episode,"The pilot set the scene for a very good series.The actors performances were excellent - story line kept you engrossed.Waking the dead is one of my favourite series, along side Foyle's War, and Inspector's Lynley and Frost.In my opinion Trevor Eve is first class in the role of Peter Boyd."
1,A foul and moronic book,"The fascist, anti-semite, and plagiarist Garrigou-Lagrange was the twentieth century's chief exponent of Dominican-style Thomism. This is the most repellant of his lousy books: a vigorous defense of the revolting predestinarianism of Banez and the rest of the Dominican thugs. As with all Garrigou's books, a few faulty premises are used to construct an entirely coherent--and yet obviously idiotic--system. When will this trash go finally out of print?"
4,Not that soft,"While this is defintly softer than the thick pointed curry comb, it is not that soft. I have an OTTB and i still can't use this on his stomach or flank, hopefully with more use it will loosen up."
3,Probably best for dogs with a short coat,Found it a little bit stiff and not as effective for my puppy but overall the quality is good so it might work better some some.
1,VERY DISSAPPOINTED,THE ORIGINAL HOCKEY NIGHT IS A GREAT MOVIE. UPON WATCHING THE NEW DVD THAT I JUST PURCHASED I WAS UPSET TO DISCOVER THAT HALF THE MOVIE WAS GONE. THEY SHOULD HAVE MADE IT A POINT AND STATED THAT THE MOVIE WAS EDITED. IT WAS CERTAINLY A WASTE OF $18.
3,Hockey Night Disappointment,"Hockey Night is a wonderful movie. My husband and I taped it during the 80's and played it so much that the tape finally gave out. We were very excited that there was a DVD version of the movie until we purchased it and found out that the movie had been dramatically edited. It was not advertised nor labeled as an edited version and the portions of the movie that were removed were poorly edited and done so with no taste. When originally aired this was an after school ""family"" PG 13 movie made in Canada. The unedited version of the movie was a true to life uplifting story. The edited version removes reference to actual reality and what life is all about. We would like our money back since this movie is falsely advertised. If Family TV company who creates these DVD's owns rights to this movie and others then they should make an ""unedited"" version available."
2,so angry!,"How could they butcher such a tame and great TV movie? I'm so pissed off! Going to have to get my old ex-rental VHS back off my friend now, cause this dvd was a complete waste of money and time! I just hope some better, more legit company releases the full version soon!"
5,Hockey Night DVD,I was so excited to see this title available on DVD. Order came very quickly and in perfect condition. Thank You!
3,nice,item cam fast and the bottle was much larger than I expected. I feel that this does not actually clean my face so I sometimes have to use a mild cleanser before using this. It worked well enough but nothing spectacular. I have since stopped using it and moved on to something that works better for me. However as far as glycolic cleansers go this one was good and comes in a large bottle.
4,Great Songs...wrongly labeled,"I was happy when I found that these selections were available for purchase. I had this recording on audio tape, and I wore the tape out! However, the songs are mislabeled...so be sure to listen to the tracks before buying...I didn't, and I thought I was purchasing ""God Is"" when what I really got was ""We Shall Behold Him."" Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things because I love that song too!"
4,Wuy this game is sooooooo good,This game is very fun and funny. It's a great adventure game. You can go tong sliding and bungy jumping. This game gos on for a long time and it keeps you buisy. You have to defet the robots and you get shiny objects.
5,You will probably like this game,"Hello, I think that this game is fun, although as you see five starts on there, I would have wished that I could have put 4 1/2 stars on there. Because one of the very, very, very, very few things that I wouldn't like about this game is that in some of the levels, once you beat some sort of bad guy or something then you wouldn't be able to play it again. You would be able to go in that spot but the bad guy wouldn't be there. One thing I do like about the game is you can easily go to any place in the game that you have already made it to. Before you can start with anything in the game you will first have to get out of spongebobs house. In this game you will be collecting certain items to get to certain parts of the game. Remember golden spatulas are what you collect to get to certain levels. Have fun playing this game, I loved it and you probably will love it too!"
4,video game review,"in this game you must stop millions of robots from taking over the city!play as sandy, patrick,and sponge bob as you figure out who is behind the plot and save the town"
4,No drip wood glue,"Great solution for molding installations. I do molding installations (mostly crown) in occupied homes and this has proven to be a no mess solution. Previously I had to put a cloth on the floor lest regular glue drip from the joint as I was fixing it to the wall. Not any more. This stuff is thick and does not drip. Great product. I've been using it direct from the container it comes in and this has not been the best. Difficult to squeeze and bottle deforms and can crack open. I need to find a better applicator. But for field glue ups, this stuff rocks. Highly recommended."
4,leave it to beany,I read this book years ago and have never forgotten the character beany Malone. Was unable to find any of Lenora Weber books in our public library. Would like for my grand children to have access to these books.
1,this thing sux.,the remote is very spotty. sometimes it works sometimes it does not. If you can find this item locally its worth the xtra couple of dollars if u need to return it locally
1,Catholic Music 2007,This has to be the most horrible music I have ever heard. This music is not Catholic. Its the touchy feely disgusting music that our protestant brothers and sisters have brought and you want to call Catholic. Give me a break! This is by far NOT Catholic.
3,Can't reach,This would have been a five star but you can't reach the controls. They should have engineered them to be accessible on the face of the vent.
5,Spot on tuning,"After a number of years of not devoting any significant time to playing, I started to dust off the guitars and basses and began practicing again. As part of the process I began to replace cables, amp tubes, etc. When I recently acquired an '02 American P-Bass, it was sounding desifinado. My Sabine XIP-700 tuner was at least 10 years old and I decided it was time to replace it. The Yamaha is great, accurate and easy to use. I wish the screen was backlit to make it easier to read, but all my axes are sounding better than ever. A great tuner for someone who isn't gigging regularly."
5,fine tuner,This has been a great little tuner. I've had it for around 8 years with no problems at all. It works especially well on guitars with pick-up.
1,What happened to Catherine Anderson???????,"She is one of the few authors who ALWAYS make it to my ""keeper"" shelf. This time???? BIG MISS!!!! I gave this one to the Used Book Store as soon as I finished. Why? The first half of the book was a textbook and the second half was the most forced love story I've ever read. The sad thing is that she did a great job with explaining and portraying a heroine with a disability in Phantom Waltz. In Blue Skies, we get page after page of visual cortex this and visual cortex that.... instead of character development. ..."
1,wish i could have changed the channel,"This book reads like a bad Lifetime network movie. The female protagonist can be dramatic, selfish, mean, and unwillingly to take responsibility for her own actions, yet all anyone can talk about is how sweet and wonderful and strong she is. The hero of the story bends over backwards, jumps through hoops, stopping just short of begging her to be with him. The story was just blah. There was so much more time spent talking about her blindness than the pregnancy that forced them together in the first place, I was mainly bored throughout the whole book. I usually pass on the Lifetime movies and I should have passed on this book."
1,Hated carly,I really hated Carly. She blamed Hank from the beginning. It was her choice to get drunk that night and loose her virginity. He did not force her. I don't care if he was drunk. She is responsible for her own actions don't but blame on other people. Being blind all her life should not have been an excuse. I hate women who use a baby as a possession against a man. I don't care what he has done to you that does not mean you have to keep his child away from him. Carly was just childish. She was 28 but settled things by not talking but acting like a big baby. Everything was about her. I honestly wanted Hank to leave her. She was not a good person . They kept saying how sweet she was but I saw a mean selfish person. Overall story sounded like it was going to be good but only made me mad.
2,A Disappointing Read,"Blue Skies is a dime a dozen, cliche modern-day cowboy/rancher romance with an innocent ignorant heroine and a hunky chauvinistic womanizer hero. The dialogue is corny and clumsy. The characters are superficial and underdeveloped. The plot has been done before. Pickup at a bar, one night stand. Pregnancy. Hero does the honorable thing--marries the heroine temporarily just until the baby is born, blah, blah blah. So what. Secondary characters introduced so that you'll supposedly be compelled to buy the other Coulter saga's--if you have to , use the library instead.And the medical diagnosis for the blindess is written like a clinical college lecture--too forced for me.I've read other Catherine Anderson novels that I thought were a lot more entertaining than this one. Definitely not worthy of the overall 4-star rating."
1,Stolen Plot,"I read this book and I thought the plot sounded familiar, but I couldn't figure it out. A couple weeks later I was watching an older X-Men with my brother and it was about Hank (the Beast) helping treat a woman named Carly with blindness. She's able to see again and they fall in love. Catherine Anderson totally stole this story! At the least she should have changed the names! I was really disappointed, I was starting to like the series..."
4,"Great writing, even if it was a bit heavy-handed",I enjoyed this book mostly for Ms. Deveraux's writing style. The setting was wonderful and I thought the story was well-paced. The characters were well-developed. I suppose the one aspect that kept getting under my skin was the whole labor vs. owner saga. I thought it was a bit heavy-handed.
3,Not close to her best but wasn't her worst.,"I love Jude Deveraux and all her books are amazing especially The Enchanted Land. . Now that book was to die for. This . . I didn't like Amanda's character. She was prim,proper and just all together totally abnocious(sp?). She was very annoying. It wasn't the worst though I wouldn't reccomend this book, I wouldn't condemn it either."
3,Heroine is really not likeable,"I love many of this author's books, however this was not one of my favorite. The hero, Hank, is fantastic, but the heroine in the novel is simply pathetic. It's difficult to figure out what he sees in her, aside from another person to ""save."" The novel points out repeatedly that he has a hobby of ""helping strays,"" and I could never get past seeing her as one of them rather than a true love match."
5,Swoon!,"I love Jude Devereax and have read almost every one of herbooks, but this has to be my 2nd favorite (the 1st is of course AKnight in Shining Armor). Why can't there be real men like the Montgomery's? This book is so full of passion and intrigue I refused to put it down."
2,CRAPPY GAME!!!!!!,This game was PATHETIC!!!!! I bought it because I like the show and it SUCKS!!! I beat the whole game in 30 MINUTES!!! If you really want to try this game out ( you probably don't) RENT IT FIRST ( I have temporarily taken over your mind by making you read this review)
1,This Game Is Extremely Dumb!,"I love The Fairly OddParents, but I hate the developer Blitz Games. Conflict: a Fairly OddParents game was made by Blitz Games. I got it for Christmas and was happy, until I (regretfully) put this piece of junk in my Xbox. After 5 minutes I was bored and still hadn't finished level one. This game stinks! The graphics are horrible, the sound effects are annoying (especially the ""jingle"" noise the collectable crowns make), and this game just isn't funny. It tries to be, but it just seems like they tried too hard. If you buy this game, take it back. If you haven't don't. This game is terrible! }:("
4,awsm,"I loved the game! it is fun because it's funny. i like it when you have to dance, turn into a dog, and be in the video game."
4,Microsoft books and Certification Track,"In Windows NT exams I tried to read some of the preparing materials that were released by MS press but at that time I found them so complicated to be a source for taking an exam. With the new windows 2000 I picked up this book and found that it is much focused on the exam objectives. One thing you should know and keep in mind ""I passed it today"" this books is not enough as the only resource to pass the exam but it would be a very good point to start studying."
3,It's a start,"I could fill a book with what is not explained or is surfed over in this book. You probably should buy it, but look for supplementary material. I used this book in a class structure. But had to buy two other books to get a well rounded picture of the Windows 2000 client O/S.In case you are wondering, I took and passed the big test. Further, I still use this book as a reference, but only for general information. For detail, I use ""another book"" by a famous author of Windows 2000 books. This does not bode well for the content of this book. But without the structure of this book; don't risk your hard earned bucks seeking Microsoft's blessing."
2,Rather Inadequate,"This book does cover a good bit of the material included on the exam. However, it omits quite a bit of it, too. Passing the exam requires much expertise with networking principles, and this book does not come close to covering that subject."
3,Good book if you are holding MCSE NT 4.0,"This book is good if you have MCSE NT 4.0 background. You must have known DNS, DHCP, Networking Microsoft OS's, etc before opening this book which doesn't meet the requirement for the Windows 2000 Professional study guide (for a newbies). This book is not for those new in MCSE track. Sad to say, you must have read the Server, and Networking Guide before you open this book. It falls down very badly from the Windows NT 4.0 Workstation Training Kit. In the case of this book, the exam should be 70-217 not 70-210 because the Server Exam is 70-215 and Networking Exam is 70-216 which you should have known first before opening this book. If you give this book to a newbie, the person will throw a lot of question to you regarding configuring DNS, DHCP, etc which I experience when I lend this to my colleague who is a Unix guy and want to switch to Windows."
2,Useless for the exam,"As a tool to prepare for the W2K workstation test, this book is a flop. Okay basic knowledge for introduction. Be sure to read the resource kit, if passing the test is your main goal."
2,Not enough to make a nice score,"Hello,I also read this training kit and took the exam. I do find that the book is well written and contains a lot of usefull information... but it isn't enough to pass the exam. I got a lot of questions about subjects that weren't covered in the book. Luke me... i passed with a score of 660 (620 was needed). I really hate Microsoft Exams very long questions etc. I've done a lot of Novell exams and they are much better. Also the Novell books did cover everything for the exam. I give this book 2 stars because it just doesn't cover every objective you need to pass the exam.This book is not for people like me who want to know everything and make a big score on the exam.Greetings,A dude from Veenendaal, The Netherlands."
1,Absolutly Worthless,"If your buying this book in order to study for MCSE test 70-210, don't bother. I read this book through and through, and although the information contained therein is relevant to day to day activities, it misses almost all subjects on the test by a long shot. I had everything in this book memorized, and have failed the test twice. I'd wait to buy the exam cram (Coriolis) and the exam notes (sybex) books."
2,Don't waste your money unless your not serious.,"This book was/has been a major dissapointment, I have relied on every source imaginable for preparation for 70-210 and this one was particulary bad in that it ignores many items while putting emphasis on items you may not encounter. This book is ok if you just want to learn windows 2000 pro and be able to work with it, but not if you want to get certified. It completely neglects the novell/w2k enviroment and does not cover RIS/SYSPREP/unattended installations in enough detail. It's pretty crummy when the company who makes the software and the tests cant get it together."
4,Greate... I pass the exam,"This is a good book people who plan to take MCP 70-210 certificate. I just pass the exam today, I spend most of my time to use this during the time that I learn and found it very explaination..."
3,You'll need more than this book...,"How an MS Press book could be published and miss some of the ""Skills Being Measured"" is beyond me. If you're going to publish a book for your own friggin' software, do it right.It doesn't even get into using Remote Installation Services or using SysPrep. WTF?!?!? I felt like I got more info and hands-on reading Sybex's MCSE Windows 2000 Professional Study Guide.I also bought the Academic Learning Series version of this book, hoping it would have more information, new information, or something different. It's no different than this book, except the cover.I'm debating whether or not I'll ever buy another MS Press book."
2,"25 Chapters, 25 Authors","I'm convinced that MSPress comissioned 25 authors to each write a chapter and then come together for the book. The chapters show little (if any) continuity and the layout is questionable at best. For instance - Installation is covered in Chapter 2, but deployment (network and unattended installs) aren't covered until Chapter 23. Hardware is covered in Chapter 4 but you need to wait until Chapter 25 for the Device Manager! HUH? What were they thinking?The material is also too verbose for basic concepts, and way too high level for the more technical concepts. If this is your only study guide, then I weep for your future.In the end - don't do it. Yes, it's MS. Yes, it's from the mouths of babes. But just because it comes from the same company as the OS doesn't mean it's the definitive guide. This book just isn't worth it."
5,Good Stuff!!,If you want to really learn Windows 2000 while studying for the 70-210 exam then get this book. Great detail and practice excercises to prepare you for the real mccoy.
2,It could be much better,"Not very helpful to learn real stuff, too superficial. I found more interesting the concise information of Readiness review of MS Press."
1,terrible,"Common sense tells us that who would know more about a product then it's inventors. Who whould be better to teach us about that product then the inventors. Well Microsoft has not and does not believe in common sense. you rely on this book to pass the test or to know anything pratical about 2000 and buddy you're in for a world of hurt. It leaves out significant details and aspects of 2000 that are need for a complete understanding of 2000. Yes, what little detail and knowledge it prvides are accurate, but they are so few. Old Billy Gates again with a half attempt like everything he does. It seems their idea of common sense is: Well we charge $135 a test and sell the book for $45 and since they'll never pass the test on the first or second try then we'll make a bundle. Save your money and save your time. Buy the Sybex book for preparation for the test."
5,Not for the Newbie,"This book is well written with clear, concise language. It is presented in a logical fashion and is a much better read that the NT 4 kits. I will say however that you do need some experience or already have your NT 4 MCSE to get the most out of it. The book itself states that the intended audience are IT professionals and that a prerequisite is ""A knowledge of the fundamentals of current networking technology is required"" Unlike the NT 4 track, which you can be a newbie and get through it, I think MS has raised the bar on this one (Win2k). If you meet the requirements I wholeheartedly recommend this book. Whether or not it is sufficient to pass the exam remains to be seen."
5,the best book for learn windows 2000 professional.,"i am mcse of windows nt 4.0 and i read this book and he is coverd all you need to know for pass rhe 70-210 exam. but, i recommnded that you will be expiriance beafore you'l take this exam. ( this book is not for the beginners )."
1,"by FAR, the worst certification book i've ever read","this book is by far the worst certification book i have ever been through. it is not simply worse than the rest, it is orders of magnitude worse. concepts that are glanced over are covered in detail on the test. this happens multiple times. the only reason i passed the test is because of the study questions i practiced with. there is no excuse for not covering the information, since microsoft also wrote the test. they know what is going to be asked. they should cover it."
3,carry over from NT 4,"Lots of good hands on exercises, but there seems to be some carry over from NT 4 workstation. As an example the section on editing the boot.ini neglects to tell you about the hidden OS files, only the hidden files."
2,Director's cut sucks!,"I was thrilled when this movie was finally released on DVD. I had taped it off cable years ago, but was never able to buy it on video tape. WHAT A BUMMER...this is a ""directors cut"". It sucks compared to the original theater version. All of the extra scenes should have remained on the cutting room floor, and the subtitles, although more faithful to the actual French dialog, are much less enjoyable and sometimes make little sense in English.I'd love to have the original version on DVD. It was a truly great film."
1,"And Now My Love ""Toute Une Vie""","I'm glad I picked up a VHS Copy of this motion picture, which I had seen in both French & English dubbed during the 1970's. The VHS I received was in English and the dubbing was quite good. The reason I sought out a VHS copy is because I was extremely disapointed with the DVD when it was finally released. As a matter of fact, the DVD is a bloated piece of junk that shows that directors don't always make the best editors. I am going to look for a VHS in French, with subtitles, because at this point, there will probably never be a DVD of the original edition.The movie, as originally shown, is a great story, well made."
2,Disappointing,"I eagerly snatched up this book, as there aren't that many armchair travel books about Chile. Unfortunately I just got bogged down with this one (twice!) and couldn't finish it, and I'm an avid reader who can slog through most any book. Though I wasn't expecting or even hoping for the liveliest of writing, I found it dull in both presentation and choice of material. Too bad. Two stars for choosing an interesting, beautiful country to write about."
5,Journry through Chile,Travels in a Thin Country: A Journey Through Chile (Modern Library)A very intertaining journal of travels through Chile.
5,Without a doubt! The Best War Story Ever Written!,"""The Eagle Has Landed"" represents Jack Higgins at the zenith of his writing career. It is the best book he ever wrote. The characters are real and what is particularly refreshing is that this is one of few novels that showed that not all German soldiers were morally vacuous Nazis. One of the characters, Kurt Steiner, is the larger than life, man of honor that is written convincingly. What is surprising is that the sequel (""The Eagle Has Flown"")to this novel is also a success. I am not a fan of war novels, but this tale transcends the genre. Give it a try! You wont be disappointed."
3,Overated,"I have read so many positive reviews about this book and about Higgins, that I probably set my expectations up too high.Sure, the book is good, the characters have a strong presence, and the plot is well conceived, but in summary it didn't seem more than an OK book.Definitely not the type of book you simply can't put down."
4,WWII fiction at its best,"I wondered why this book was still in print and selling briskly after all these years. Then I read it. The tension, the plot-line, the crescendo, the ending. It's all good."
5,Brilliant...a Masterpiece.,"It's a brilliantly written book, loosely based on fact but so believable!Without doubt it rates as the best wartime thriller i've ever read."
5,Really like this guy,"A real ""page turner"" on my kindle. Great writer and I hope to read more books from this writer. ."
5,If you enjoy thrillers.....,"Lose yourself in this one. The premise is fascinating, and the book is tough to put down. I read it in 2 days.I'm off to the next book in the series!Enjoy!"
5,Excellent,Very interesting historical novel with intense and continuous action. A lot of suspense. Hard to put it down. Definitely recommend this book.
1,Did not catch my interest...,"I tried to get into this book, I really did, but it failed to capture me.I love espionage novels, 'Eye of the Needle' being a reallygood one, but this book... the characters failed to draw mein. It took some effort to finish it.Notice the number of times alcohol is mentioned in this book.People keep drinking as if they are paid for it...Try Frederick Forsyth instead."
4,Diversity of characters make an interesting story,"Unlike some other books, this one presented the characters in a logical order, not cluttering up their backgrounds or popping them out of the blue before tying them to the story.The tale is credible, the characters likable, including the Germans, the Irish, and even Preston could be too if more work had been put into it. It may be hard to accept traditional enemies as being humans and even honourable but that is how life is.As practically everyone knows that Churchill lived to see the end of the war, it was not a real issue whether the Germans succeeded but the Higgins wove the tale in such an absorbing way that the reader actually forgets that and think it really could have been pulled off. In fact, the last part of the book hinted that it could have as easily really happened, that the team succeeded."
5,Great Story!,This is my favorite Jack Higgins story. Only down side is that it shares almost the exact same scene as one found in Solo.
4,i like it,a very good story that made me feel like living in the world war ii era. better than many history books in that merit
3,The Eagle Has Landed,"The Eagle has Landed is Jack Higgins' master piece, an excellent plot, story and development of characters. This keeps you on edge until the end. I have read this previously but can't help but revisit. Highly recommended."
4,Excellent!..But...,"The reader's English accent and pronunciation, intonation are excellent and splendid!However, I prefer that the reader who reads women's lines is woman."
5,First Class Story,"Having seen the movie The Eagle Has Landed more times than I can remember I decided finally to read the book. I was totally taken aback to discover that it was based on an actual event with real life characters. An amazing story. The movie version does not do the story justice and recommend anyone who has seen the movie like me, to read the book. There is so much more involved in the actual event that has been left out of the movie that reading the print version will have you captivated from start to finish."
4,The last pages are impossible to put down,"No doubt, this is the best book Jack Higgins has written so far! Although the story suffers under the bulk of espionage genre clichés, like for example ""no good suspense novel without a good romance"", the basic idea is refreshingly original.The story is told from the perspective of the German soldiers and this is a quite daring and enthralling viewpoint. In the end you are so in touch with the story and its characters that you start to hope that the Germans will succeed in their crazy mission.The pace of the narrative is quite slow for the first hundred pages, but this gives the reader the opportunity to get really involved into the lives of the main characters. This part can easily be compared with the depth reached in a John Le Carre novel. When the climax comes nearer the pace suddenly changes quite dramatically. And believe me: once the show started, you cannot put this book down. Oh no!"
5,Best War book yet!!!!!,"A world war two book that captures the mind of all readers!! Noone ca forget about when their not reading it!! Max Radl never disobyed his master, the Admiral. But his loyalty to the Admiral is only outdone by his loyalty to the Fhurer. So when Hitler starts to think anything is possible, he decides that someone should capture Churchill! The Admiral tells Radl to forget about it ( something that the Fuherer is soon to do). But soon believes it is possible and tries it!! This book combines love and action into one!!"
3,Ted J's review,"I read this fiction right after reading The Bloddy Battle Mt. Surbachi. I don't know when he wrote this but I was not impressed, well researched but in some places I found it hard to follow. Others of his were much better."
5,Interesting story,"Well written, the story was believable and held my attention. A lot of research must have gone into it. I really liked it."
4,Excellent,"Excellenr characters, well written and I enjoyed a walk back into time. The movie made many years ago was good, but certainly cannot replace the written word."
3,Review of the eagle has landed,"The Eagle Has Landed is a very well written fact-based, fictional, historical novel. I am not sure if a cross channel invasion was ever considered or attempted, but the desperate Nazi's needed a victory, so out of desperation they concocted this daring stunt. It was well enough planned that it almost worked in this account.I have enjoyed everything I have read that was written by Jack Higgins. This one was no letdown and was a very thought provoking story that could have happened."
4,bob g.,"Great read, I read most of his books years ago. This clasic does not dissapoint. Even if you have read it before do it again, you will be glad you did"
2,Not for beginners,"I feel like I wasted my money on this book. Although some of her projects are interesting, her explanation of the fusing process in general was skimpy, and of no help to beginners at all. For example, how long SHOULD one leave glass for a cabachon in the kiln? She gives average temperatures, but no times for actual fusing. 10 minutes? 2 hours? The beginner is left standing there holding pieces of cut glass and staring at her kiln, having no idea what she should do next. And as for advancing to the wire wrapping and cutting, no way... There are much better books out there, and I wish Ms. Persico would return my money on this one."
1,No addornment and NOT innovative,Don't waste your money. This book is not for any level of expertize. It is to shallow to be helpful to someone with moderate experience in glass fusing and to non-informative to be helpful for someone just starting out. This book has very few projects and leaves a lot of questions unanswered. The book to buy is Glass Fusing it goes in-depth and step by step into several projects and she is very knowledgable.
3,Jayne could do better,"While I dearly love taking classes from Jayne, this book does not represent her best work. I thought many of the items featured were not up to her usual style, although this book was from a few years ago. She needs a new book."
5,Inspirational and Enjoyable Book,"This is one of my favorite books; informational, inspirationaland excellent. It arrived in a timely manner, in wonderfulcondition. It is perfect for those beginning in the field."
5,Awesome but understated voice,It's like a Nora Jones who can really sing. An extraordinary sensitivity with vocal support. I love it. If you love this search high and low for her Flamenco Sketches you'll love it
5,pretty pretty pretty......good,i once listened to this album repeatedly while driving from las vegas to southern california. i enjoyed it. it was one of the only times in my life that i wept. literally wept. months later while in tennessee on a business trip i had the opportunity to see skippy live and it was amazing. after the show i had the chance to meet skippy (Jeff Maynard) and he was very kind but i couldn't help but notice how truely sad he was. it looked like his dog just died. i mean really sad. He actually wept onstage while performing and to be honest.......i was right there crying with him
5,"Up, up, and away","With Terry Thomas, Robert Morley, Sarah Miles and James Fox, how can you go wrong? Add in beautiful aerial photography, of both countryside and old planes, and a wacky plot, there's over 2 hours of fun."
5,Funny classic movie,This is a very funny classic comedy. It has some very funny scenes and lots of amazing aerial shots of pre WW 1 era planes. I highly recommend this movie! It is alot of fun to watch. You seldom see quality movies like this at the present time. Definitely a classic.
3,Stop playing midway through movie,The Cd stopped twice during the first viewing of the movie. My Cd player is brand new and nothing like this has ever happened to me before. Disappointing to say the least!!!
4,Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines,Classic movie but I thought I was ordering a DVD. My bad but still a very enjoyable movie. This could not be made today.
3,An amiable amusement,"Not so much a ""comedy"" as an ""amusement"", since it rarely achieves ""funny"". It's an amiable film, though, and shows off some great recreations of early aeroplanes."
5,HIGH FLYERS,"Wonderfully entertaining film with a magnificent cast including Jean-Pierre Cassel, Gert Frobe, Albert Sordi, the caddish Terry Thomas, Eric Sykes as his hapless assistant, Tony Hancock, Sarah Miles, James Fox, Robert Morley and many others.Plenty of extras including a narration and interview with the film's director, Ken Annakin. The real stars are the aeroplanes and director Annakin goes into great detail about how scenes were shot and technical difficulties overcome. Because of the cost and the going over budget the whole project was very nearly abandoned. Thank goodness it wasn't - despite the lack of CGI this film looks realistic and perhaps because of the lack of modern technology it has retained an immense charm which all the family can enjoy. And the musical score is wonderful as well.Beautifully restored in anamorphic full screen this is a film not to be missed. Highly recommended!!"
5,hilarious,"This movie is entertaining for people of all ages with comedy, romance, and a tiniest splash of drama."
4,Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines,A Classic movie that includes many of the popular stars of the day. It is very funny and demonstrates the difficulty and reliability of the early planes
5,Those magnificent men in their flying machines,"This movie has been one of my most favourtie comedies of all times. It is a classic that never appears dated. Excellent performances by the very best of actors, a joy to view every time"
4,Fantasicly funny movie,Made back in the 1960's this move is good fun. Many of the classic comics of the day were in the movie and the comedy continues throughout the film with a great story line. If you like aviation and enjoy a few good laughs this film is well worth your time.
4,Very funny movie,"A great cast including Benny Hill, Terry Thomas and many others. Wish that they would bring back Those Magnificent Men and their Jaunting Jalopies"
2,Crash,The Movie is nothing short of great but the DVD disc is damaged in manufacture. If someone had checked it before shipping it should have been put in the garbage.
4,"hilarious, outrageous, historical fiction","I got this for my son, who I thought would enjoy it. Sure, there is lots of good slapstick - he was drawn in by the wonderful opening with Red Skelton trying to fly and failing - but there is also a lot of parody according to nationalities. There are the disciplined, fair-playing Brits, the impulsive and inventive American, the difficult noisome Frenchman, the rigid Kraut, etc. Because we live in EUrope and saw how he played with these stereotypes, we loved it even more. Sure, it is not extremely subtle, but it is a great adventure comedy and it does not seem to have aged.Warmly recommended."
5,Review of Those Magnivicent Men in Their Flying Machines,"Hey - I have ordered a lot of STUFF but this is the best yet! It caused me problems trying to get the order figured out, but now that I am ""in"" I am happy! You might want to go through your own order info for someone who has never ordered from Amazon before though - - - there are different ways to take each sentence you used - - -"
4,Flying Adventures,"Great characterizations, Terry Thomas has a great role as the ""villain"". A good complement to The Great Race! The other characterizations are well done."
5,Fun movie,"I am a fan of movies and have many that I like, but there is a list of about 10 movies from my childhood that are my all time favorites. This movie is on that list. I love the crazy antics,the prat falls, even the plane going into the cesspool that makes me cringe. This is a family friendly film though I think adults will probably enjoy the jokes more.The cast is wonderful and this movie is fully enjoyable."
3,"Strange, weird movie",I bought Magnificent Men because my four year old loves old airplanes and he actually watched the whole movie from beginning to end. When the airplanes are actually moving and the race is on or they're practising is quite interesting and somewhat engaging. The rest of the silliness is just that...silly and fun...esp. for a four year old. Some of it of course is over his head. The anniv. edition has some great info on how the film was made and who actually flew those original made machines.The airplanes are definitely the star of this film.
1,Battery Not Needed,"I bouth this battery (Kodak MAX CRV3 Lithium) but only after I receveid it I noticed that it would not fit -- I had bought the wrong battery. So, I tried to get instructions on how to return it but could not find them anywhere."
4,Wish to recharge,"Great battery, just wish I could recharge that's all. I found the price a good bargin, and it shipped fast."
5,Very satisfied,Would definitely order from these folks again. The batteries were delivered promptly and in excellent condition.Much appreciated!
2,Disappointed!!,"Did not get Kodak Max, instead recieved regular Kodak CRV3 battery. I thought I was ordering a better version, seller NEEDS to change misleading picture!!"
1,doesn't hold charge very long,This battery doesn't hold the charge long enough to take many pictures. I'm very disappointed it this purchase. I was looking for a battery that would hold the charge.
1,Did not delivered as promised.,"The issue is not with the battery. It's with the delivery that I chose for this product. Bottom line, I had paid for two day shipping to arrive at my home prior to moving from Ohio to Hawaii. After five days, it did not arrive and I moved. It was supposedly being delivered via USPS, which has my forwarding address effective the day of my move. It has not shown up yet in Hawaii either. Needless to say, I am very disappointed.I had forgotten about this issue because I received the rest of my order from that shipment. Moving across a continent and an ocean may increase stress. I will NOT be purchasing any additional batteries from the vendor. I have not received a refund either. Buyer beware."
1,Con - Man..........,"After review of your site and after receiving your item, it is clear that your intent was to deceive the buyer.. it is not a CRV3 Lithium Rechargeable battery but a Lithium disposable... NON-RECHARGEABLE garbage for $7 plus dollars OMG... and you wonder why people are run down and seen on the 10 o;clock news..."
1,Dead Kodak Battery,"I used my digital camera on only four occasions where I took over 60 pictures at a time. I was at a wedding reception when the battery went dead on me. I was able to squeeze some pictures out by taking one shot; camera shut down, let battery recharge a little, take another shot, camera shut down again. I finally gave up after 8 shots. The docking station does not recharge the battery as advertized."
1,Problems,"I got to the tip of Alaska, and none of the four batteries worked no power!I missed getting a day of once in a life time pictures.David Highet"
1,Kodak Rechargeable Ni MH Battery Pack,I purchased two rechargeable batteries with my new DX4900 camera. These two batteries are next to worthless; they just don't last and there seems to be nowhere to find relief or a refund!!
3,Works for me,"I put this battery in my much used digital camera in July 2002, and here it is April 2003 and it's just now died. But it doesn't give much notice (about 5 seconds) when it loses power."
1,wrong item rec'd,I ordered Kodak Max CRV3..........I recieved Energizer CRV3.these batteries are not the same and do not last as long I wish to get what I ordered!!!!
3,Wrong Brand Received!,"I ordered 2 Kodak MAX CRV3 Lithium Batteries, as pictured on site, and received2 Energizer Lithium Photo Batteries. Packing slip read Kodak MAX CRV3 Lithium Batteries, not Energizer. What gives?"
3,NO EXP DATE--FOREIGN MADE,"Very disappointed that this battery does not have a freshness/expiration date. I have NO IDEA how long to expect it to last!! I guess it's because the packaging is mostly in a foreign language, and other countries don't require a date. I saved money buying this battery here, but did I get the same value??"
1,Digital Camera battery CRV3,I ordered this battery (CRV3) as it is the number my camera uses. The battery is not a Max CRV3 as indicated in your letter and it also does not fit the camera. It is too long and I can't return it as that is your policy since it has been opened . Do you have shipping label since it was someone elses mistake or the manufacturers and not mine? I would return it.Carol Smith
1,wrong illustration,The battery you are showing is not the correct battery. That is not what the Lithium CRV3 3V looks like! Very confusing. I'm afraid to order thinking I'll get what the picture shows.
3,THIS BATERY IS NOT RECHARGABLE,"This battery is not rechargable. I was so disapinted. The description of this product is not clear enought.The batteries are good, but at the end you will have to purchase new ones."
1,No charge?,"Maybe I am missing something, but I put this battery in my camera and nothing happened. I could not turn it on at all. It was as if I didn't even have a battery in my camera. I guess I'll look for a new one elsewhere..."
2,digital camera batteries,"Well, I ordered these digital camera batteries on July 22nd and on August 21st one of them died already. How long are these supposed to last?"
3,MUST GIVE IT A MIXED REVIEW,"There is a lot of stuff in this book... some fun, little funny, and a lot that's dumb. If the book was intended just as a historical collection of the clever and corny, it succeeded, but if every entry was meant to entertain, it fell short. I do not regret the purchase and recommend it... just don't expect to do a lot of laughing (but you'll chuckle from time to time.)"
1,Deceptive,"I received my pens in a week but only one. I thought by the picture and the way it is set up it was 2 pens it is not it is ONE, this is deceptive."
2,Cheesy Animation Poorly Designed,"This game is not on the level of the other Nick Games we have played. My son and I just finished Sponge Bob: The Battle for Bikini Bottom, which was a very good game. We purchased this game thinking it would be as good as SpongeBob. It is not. The graphics are grainy and many parts have a Play Station One pixellated feel. Wanda and Cosmo talk way too much. The game is pretty easy with a few semi-difficult parts. The problem is if you die in a harder part it reloads, you wait for your system to reset and then you have to start back at your last save point. Then you have to listen to all of Wanda and Cosmo's rambling again (or hit X a hundred times). You can save the game if you find a save point but they are not placed very well. We spent more time doing easy parts over than than we did playing in a new and challenging area. Not worth the money with so many other well designed games to choose from at your local game store."
1,You're looking at this?,You probably don't know this game. Nintendo 64 games are better! They're making the current console systems look bad! Why did a waste 40 bucks?!?! Mouth animation doesn't go with them talking. Story isn't very good. Levels are short and easy. Almost the only thing you do is jump and run. It's also boring. Non-humorous like the show. The Ultimate Challenge(the last stage) is the easiest part of the game! And graphics: TERRIBLE! Don't come near this game.
4,Daughter loves,Ordered this game for my daughter for Christmas and she seems to love it. We still order PS2 games for her to try and this is a good recommend.
5,My son loves this game!,I got this game for my son for christmas. He really has enjoyed it. I recommend it to those who don't want their kids playiing all those violent games they have out today. Takes his mind off of school for an while before bedtime.
1,Bird Refused,"My bird turned up his beak at these ""Birdie Bananas"". Lesson learned - Quaker Parrots don't like ""Birdie Bananas""."
2,This Shampoo Ruined My Hair,"I had high hopes for this shampoo after reading so many positive reviews. I think it might have done good things for my scalp but it kind of wrecked the texture of my hair. It took a couple of weeks of treatments and a hair cut to get it mostly back to normal. Also, the smell? Not so great. Quite overpowering actually and I've used shampoos packed with strong levels of tea tree oil and neem - both of which can be pretty stinky - and they were nothing compared to the chemical smell of this shampoo."
4,Shampoo & Body Cleanser Aqua Glycolic,I love this product. My dermatologist recommended this when I was 16 I am now hitting my 40's and started to have breakouts again. The fragrance smells like baby powder scent and if its too strong you can dilute it a bit with another liquid soap. I can't take alot of fragrance and this has never bothered me. Just follow the directions and leave on for 2 mins. If you use in the morning I would reccomend a sunscreen. I like to use it at night.
2,DASH KIT FOR MY 03 TACOMA ? UNIVERSAL?,"WELL LIKE THE OTHER GUY SAID ... YOU GONNA HAVE TO CUT AND TO ADOPT THINGS IN ORDER TO FIT... AND IN MY CASE IT IS USELESS FOR ME TO USE IT BECAUSE... I HAVE A 7"" SOUNDSTREAM INDASH DVD AND MEDIA RECIEVER/PLAYER... THAT HAS TO BE MOUNTED AN INCH FORWARD IN ORDER FOR THE FACE TO LAND RIGHT WHEN IT FLIPS OUT... DEFINITELY THIS KIT DOES'NT HELPED ME AT ALL... I GOT TO USED THE FACTORY MOUNT (PLAYER MOUNT) TO DASH....THEN LEAVE THE EXTRA DECK UN COVERED ... I NEED TO CUSTOMIZED LOTS OF STUFFS/PARTS GOOD THING IM HANDY CAUSE IF NOT OHHHH... ITS GONNA BE A PAIN IN A BUTT..."
4,"Great dash kit, but be aware","Purchased this dash kit for my 03 tacoma, worked beautifully, however, I had to really cut and change the dash kit to fit properly. The instructions already warn of such possibilities, being a ""universal"" kit you would expect something like that anyway.Assembly is quite easy and the manual makes it even easier as it tells you exactly where you should put the mounts, clips and etc according to your car/truck model.However, you might need to cut several parts of the dash kit(not your car dash) and adapt things to make it fit in your car, like I had to do with mine, but once its done it fits perfectly and looks great too!"
3,"simple tale, nice but not new","I noticed that a few reviewers praised this novel as bringing something new to the coming-of-age genre. While I did enjoy the read, I can't quite agree...the character had her own story but the overall feel was pretty typical. The protagonist is feeling her way in the area between child and adult, exploring responsibility, belief, and sexual contact. Her background is unique...she's 15 and has moved annually with her family in support of her dad's art and she was raised by athesist parents who are concerned when she explores the church-going neighbors...but her voice felt pretty typical.Again, I liked the novel. It was a simple, easy read. But it will likely just blend in my memory with similar stories."
4,Touching story with a,girl that will touch your heart. Tamara does a wonderful job of saying it how it is and I couldn't put this book down for even a moment. I felt sad when this book ended and it will stay with me for awhile.Tamara has been left to care for her sister and brother while her mom is sick and her dad has left to sell his paintings and avoid reality. I loved when they went skinny dipping and I could have just imagined what it must have been like when Mr Murphy went down there and caught them and to have to get up while he was standing there! I wanted to be in that garden with Tamara and Mrs Burns.This is a book you will love and this is an author to keep your eye on!
5,Thoroughly engaging!,"This is a charming, insightful, and intense read, a coming of age story, that will capture the heart ten-fold.The story, set in the 50's, begins with the Anderson's arriving at their new home after yet another move. Fifteen year old Tamara has lived in a different house every year, with only her parents and her brothers as constants. She decides that this move, to yet another rented house, will be her last! The story goes that this one was abandoned by parents who couldn't stand the grief of the death of their beloved son who died of leukemia the year before. Her father is an artist who needs new things and landscapes to paint, hence the moves, and her mom, a radical, too political woman, gets desperately ill later on. There's humor to go along with the serious melodrama and poetic writing that will keep you thoroughly engaged."
5,Some Things That Stay,"I loved this book so much that I mailed it to my Mom, and enclosed an envelope for her to mail it to my daughter. There were so many great phrases on every page that I wanted to highlight them just to go back and reread them.Sarah Willis has an incredible insight into human emotions, and thoughts. After the book makes it's rounds, I will probably reread it!Great Book Club Book!"
5,"""Future Bestseller""","I read this book last year then I read it again this year. Bryant raised questions about spirituality and manhood that really came to past in certain aspects of my life. The story of Hank and River was very well written. If someone does not understand this book, its because they were not ready to read such thought provoking literature. If you scan through then you will miss everything. That is the theme, Bryant is telling us not to scan through life, we should appreciate the small things, be spiritual and patient then blessings will come.His poetry was excellent and went well with the story. This is a great novel, a ""Future Bestseller""! Keep on writing strong stories about black folk, I'm tired of the baby mama drama books."
5,Refreshing,"I was a bit hesitant about this book initially because of the title. I thought it was going to be a book without substance. Boy was I glad to have been proven wrong. I was very pleased...actually, more than pleased with the book. I was somewhat surprised at how the characters came together. For me, the turning point was when Terry went to church and got the ""Holy Ghost."" That was so incredibly well written. I felt like I was there. I loved the way Terry's character developed. I believe you have a great product here!!!""Single Man Screaming"" is somewhat of a rarity because seldom are there books written by such young men with the wisdom that was bought forth here.Bravo on a job well done!!!"
5,SINGLE MAN SCREAMING,"When I met Jerold as he was passing out copies of Single Man Sreaming, he assured me I would love his book, and he was 100% right. I could relate in some way to every character in the book from the Grandmother to the prejudiced boss. My favorite parts were his ""screaming"" sessions, where the beautiful poetry was written.Jerold is a great writer with an apparent God-given talent, and I thank you for sharing it with us all!"
2,I tried to like it,"When I first started reading the book, I kept getting confuse when the author used Terry and Tee for the main characther. Sometime I felt that the chapters never connected with one another, it's like subjects that were brought up in one chapter were never mention again. Terry didn't act like a chrisitan, he was still sleeping around with different women, Only in last few chapters did he started acting like a real chrisitan. I tried to like Single Man Screaming, but it was just too confusing to me."
1,Total disappointment,"Found the book completely useless. Had hoped to at least find one or two new ideas in it, but you must have had an EXTREMELY sheltered life in order to find anything in here that you don't already know..."
1,out-dated & boring,"I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone for three main reasons: it's outdated, having been written in 1975; it promotes infidelity by encouraging a woman to choose a man, married, taken or not and then advises on how to seduce him into your bed; it's more about women than what a man wants and how a woman can drive her man wild in bed. My husband found the same to be true of Masterson's How to Drive Your Woman Wild in Bed. Not much good information, outdated and boring except for maybe a hormone-driven teenager."
1,Thumbs down,"Both books offered little in the way of new information. Rather, it seemed an outlet for sexual stories from others. Little practical information and too basic. Crude and not sensual. We were looking for something new and exciting. Was turned off by the approval of infidelity, especially with the threat of STD's and AIDS. We were rather looking for ides to keep alive the love and joy all ready being experienced after 25 years. Thumbs down."
1,Not what I expected...........,I found this book outdated and boring. If you're wanting to learn anything new and exciting this book isn't where you'll find it.
2,Nothing New,"This book must be written for women who do not have an adventurous bone in their body. If you are looking for some new ideas, look elsewhere."
4,Correction to listing,"The listing for Husa's ""Two Sonnets from Michelangelo"" is here incorrectly listed as being conducted by Robert Whitney. It is conducted by Jorge Mester. The Cd is labeled correctly.I will not comment on the performances, since I have been a member of the orchestra since 1971, but I will say that I consider Karel Husa to be, perhaps, today's greatest living composer. Perhaps more classic examples of Husa's work can be heard on the Louisville Orchestra's CD of ""Music for Prague 1968"" and ""Apotheosis of this Earth.""(Amazon required me to give a star rating, so I gave it 4 so not to change the current average).Raymond Horton,Bass Trombonist,Louisville Orchestra"
2,Drinking Clearly Implied,"Drinking clearly implied--not just on Robert Pollard's part--on the camera man's and the director's, too. Includes snippets of shows, music videos. Most are unlabeled, so determining dates and places is difficult. A hot mess."
5,"This is a fun game for whatever age, male or female!...","I really like shopping with Amazon.com. Every order I have made, I am more than satisfied. There is always a huge selection to pick from and getting in contact with the people that has the product is easily done.Thank You for the opportunity to list and view my review.David Thorpefrom Victoria, Texas"
5,Fun for the Adults Too!,"I rented this game over and over one summer, and would play for hours! It's just the kind of mindless fun I love in a video game (reminiscent of Super Mario Brothers). Now that I have my own XBox, this was the first game I wanted to buy!"
4,I'm ready! I'm ready!,"Not just for kids! The dialogue just cracked me up. I had a hard time putting this game down. Although I did get frustrated with it at times because I'm not that good of an Xbox player. But my 7 year old son and boyfriend were always willing to help me out.I liked the fact that there were a TON of things to do. The game was crafted very well. The music tends to get to me after a while and I keep hearing Sandy saying ""I can't believe I'm wearing Spongebob's underpants"". LOL."
5,Spongebob,This game was awesome its a lot of fun for everyone! I got it for my kids and they really love it!
4,Excellent!,"This game is fun and excellent. Though there is a lot of yappin'which is annoying! Other than that, you get to fight robots,throwwatermellons, you can bunge jump, and more! You don't have to be a fan of Sponge Bob to enjoy this game. So put together in a few words, PLAY IT IF YOU HAVEN'T!!!"
4,Great Game for Sponge Bob Lovers!,My kids watch Sponge Bob all the time. They got this game as a Christmas present from Santa Claus and they absolutly love it. It is a great game and worth the money.
4,AWSM!!!!!!!!!!,"I like the show a little, but the game is AWSM!!!! I really like the sand boarding, missle bubble, and the lasso moves. Great game! A MUST BUY!!!!!!!!!"
4,"OHHHHhH, who lives in a pineapple under the sea?","I wouldn't normally review a childrens game, but this is one of the best platformers ever! Now, I don't play too many games for kids, but I like Spongebob. He is always sooo happy. As proof that I don't play kids games, the latest game I've bought is Serious Sam, and I have been playing Halo for at least a year now.The few things that hit me the wrong way were pretty serious. Firstly, Mermaid Man was not played by the same guy who does him usually and so was Mr. Krabs. That saddened me. Another thing was that it was just really easy up until I hit 50 or so golden spatulas. It was aggravating to me as a gamer, and probably all of the kids who bought this that it got so hard. You have to be anally punctual on every single jump, and I soon found myself cursing up a storm. For more cursing watch me play Mario Party...."
1,BORING,"This game is a sad shell of an even worse tv show. All you do is play a Spongebob (what kind of name is that, anyway?) and friends to stop the ""evil"" plankton (who is 1/10 your size)from taking over Bikini Bottom. This includes you doing simple puzzles and figuring out useless plot elements. Overall, the game has bad gameplay, bad controls, PS2-ish graphics, and a horrible plot trying to connect with the tv show."
2,Loud and uncomfortable,"This is the only spa mat that I have ever used so I cant compare it to others but it was really loud which is not good for me because I like to take a bath before I go to bed late at night when others are asleep so I could hardly ever use it. The bubbles are okay but they shoot out cold air, which makes it kinda chilly, and I noticed no thermal chances like the name states. Also, It is quite uncomfortable because the suction cups dont stay at the bottom of the tub, and I have an old ceramic tub, not plastic and it still doesnt stick. Whenever I sit up the mat floats up and shoots up air on top of the water level and I am constantly struggling to get the mat to stay down the entire time, so combined with the noise level and the cold chills from the air bubbles, i didnt get much enjoyment out of the spa mat and I hardly ever use it."
3,Didn't work that well for my car,The actual cup holders need to be deeper for taller travel mugs. Did not fit well in my car (97 corolla).
2,Least favorite Learning Resources game,"We have at least 5 other Learning Resources games, and this is by far our least favorite. My 4-year-old son has no problem telling us something that starts with each letter of the alphabet, and that is essentially the only learning component to this game. Moving your pieces around the board is tedious. We played a game with four people and my husband and I were bored to tears! The game took 45 minutes to complete. There is a version for older children, but my 4-year-old isn't old enough to write a list of words on a sheet of paper. Maybe in a year or two we'll take this one back down from the shelf and try again. In the meantime, I imagine it will be collecting dust, as no one has asked to play it again."
1,Horrible!!!!,"A friend gave me this to read when I was preparing to leave her house on a long plane flight. She got the book from a friend of the author. I can say, without hesitation, that this has to be one of the worst books ever put into print. I read about 1/4 of it and would have rather jumped out of the plane at 35,000 feet than finished it. It is THAT bad. Who publishes this drivel?? If they made the decision that this was good enough to publish I would hate to see the books that they did not deem too be good enough!!!! Life is too short to waste reading this junk! I have a second grade son who writes with more depth and thoughtfulness."
3,A Girl's Best Friend,"If you like ""chick lit"", then this is the book for you. It has a slow start. It does get better in about the 4th chapter but their is a lot of british lingo in this book. The ending was to rushed for my taste!"
5,I Love Dogs!,This is a great story and best of all.... the main character loves dogs! Elizabeth Young does it again!
2,I really really tried to like it...,"I am an avid reader of Chick Lit, and have read and enjoyed others by Elizabeth Young, so I felt kind of guilty about not being able to get into this book. I found myself, about halfway through, just skimming the pages. My interest started to falter with the ""Murder Mystery Weekend"" with which I found it difficult to keep up. After that, I just couldn't get into the characters. Maybe I'll enjoy her next one more..."
4,Better than Mystic River,"Finnish writer Matti Joensuu gives a vivid description of the no-future generation. His policeman, Harjunpaa, has to work on a series of seeming senseless killings, sometimes in situations that turn unexpectedly dangerous.This story is more convincing than Lehane's Mystic River. There is a feeling for the gang or tribal mentality of disaffected youth. In some ways reminiscent of aspects of Lord of the Flies.Joensuu covers some of the same ground as Henning Mankell, but has his own distinct voice. He is definitely a story-telling equal of Mankell.It is a shame that other books by Joensuu don't seem to be have been translated. The ""Homme Oiseaux""(Bird Man in the French)certainly deserves to be published in English."
3,strange...,"i have not read the whole book, just a small snippet about heydrich (p 200). it says the assassination happened ""at the troja bridge, where the traffic usually ground to a halt""... other sources say it was at a hairpin turn in the road that required a slowdown as curves do (and it was before a bridge but... the point is the curve was the main reason for the slowdown and reason for attack, not the bridge and traffic). it also says that the village of lidice had 'links' to the assassins. other sources say they simply parachute-landed near there. small mistakes... ok.but the book also says heydrich was not a racist, and not a 'dedicated nazi', but just a careerist. that is a very controversial argument but has no citations or discussion, the statement is just made. other sources point out he chaired the wanssee conference, sent orders to einsatzgruppen, and uhm ...... lots of other actions that would seem to be evidence for the opposite argument."
4,really seems to help,I have only used it a few times and I have started to notice a difference. So far so good.
2,Been using for about a week....,and haven't seen any difference in the pain. I will continue to use it but was thinking I should have experienced SOME relief from the muscle pain in my calves and the pain in my knees by now.
5,Grrrreat ointment!,I was amazed that an OTC cream could provide as much relief from pain as it does. I've been suffering from an inflammation of one of my facial nerves and the pain in my right brow area caused so much discomfort that it kept waking me up during the night. I started using Traumeel in the affected area and it reduced the discomfort enough to let me sleep through the night. I also recommended it to my father who has chronic pain in one of his legs which also keeps him awake at night -- he also said the results were great. This is now a staple item in my medicine cabinet!
2,Izzy,I was not impressed with this product. From the reviews I thought it would really help with the inflammation and ease the pain....I've just use until it is used up.
2,Incomplete order w/o cost,My order was for 3 100g Traumeel oitment. The package stated 3 tubes were enclosed. There were only two.there was also no cost paid on the invoice. I called the company and was told the third tube would be sent out and to look for it in 3-5 days. I am presently awaiting that now. The price was checked and correct but that information belongs on the invoice without having to call. That's the biggest reason for not wanting to do business with this company again. Last time I ordered through Amazon it came from Amazon in their packaging. No need to do anything but open it and Bless Amazon again.
3,Hard to say,"Not sure if this product works or not. It seems to help at certain times, then otehrs, it does not."
2,Healing,"Not sure that this product is doing anything for me. I am using it on thumbs thatare plagued with tendonitis and I do not feel any difference, yet."
5,Traumeel works!,"Our veternarian first introduced me to Traumeel when I had a staph infection that was hot, swollen and painful. It is used for animals with swelling. It helped so much that we are never without it at our house. It takes the swelling and pain out of arthritis (unless it is in a very inflammatory stage), mosquito and bee stings, and burns. I keep one in my car, purse, bedroom and kitchen and never leave home without it."
5,Traumeel: The best for relieving muscular pains,"Traumeel was recommended to me by my acupuncturist several years ago. It was recommended particularly to help relieve the arthritis pain in my fingers. I started using it morning and night on my hands; and the relief was quick and lasting. I now almost use it like hand cream. My fingers are much less stiff than they used to be, and I am no longer constantly aware of them. I have recommended this product to many friends, and all think as highly of it as I do.I just recently found that I could purchase Traumeel through Amazon so I now can maintain my supply easily and save some money doing so."
5,Aches N Pains,My Brother-in-law recommended this for plantar fascitis. Now I'm a doubter but I thought I'd give it a shot. Hey Presto! it worked. Now my Arthur Itic knee gets slathered. Not as spectacular but it is cheaper than a lot of prescription drugs and non-addictive.
3,Does Traumeel work?,"I used this overpriced cream several times for knee soreness due to past injuries. In my opinion it works about the same as most external applications such as Ben Gay. The difference is that you don't actually feel any strong heat. As far as its effectiveness, I can't say for sure because I no longer have serious pain. Although it could be psychological, it did appear to help with my minor soreness. Whether it can be attributed to the Traumeel is debatable. According to my many hours of research on pain and muscle injury, I've read that most external applications (not including prescription creams and ointments) are minimally effective at best and are only useful for temporarily covering up the pain as opposed to help with healing. In my opinion Traumeel seems to be a simple over the counter treatment with minimal help (at best) for pain.Nathan"
4,For what ails you...,"This product was recommended to me by my physiatrist (Physical, Medicine and Rehabilitation Physician). She actually uses this product for her knee problems. I was having problem with tendonitis of elbows due to over use syndrome on computers. Instructed to use three times per day and continue for several weeks. I found that it helped in addition to tendon bands. Was able to stop non-steroidal medications like Ibuprophen and just use the Traumeel. I keep it around at home for muscle and joint injuries or overuse and highly recommend trying a non-medicinal approach."
1,BROKE OUT ITCHING ALL OVER MY BODY,I WOULD SUGGEST YOU USE A SMALL AREA TO TRY THIS OUT. I PUT IT ON MY SHOULDER AND BROKE OUT IN A RASH AND ITCHING ALL OVER MY BODY. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE TOOK A COUPLE OF HOURS TO WORK ITS WAY OUT OF MY SYSTEM. I TOOK 3 SHOWERS.NOT A GOOD EXPERIENCE.
5,No More Pain,I have severe and chronic mid-back pain and the Traumeel cream is the only product which provides full relief and allows me to sleep. I use it for leg cramps and achy feet also. A miracle cream!
5,soreness reliever delivers,this product is a very effective pain reliever. i have used it to ease discomfort associated with plantar fascia tendinitis as well as for a contusion that occurred on my rump following a fall. i consider it to be nothing short of miraculous in its ability to deliver relief.
5,Can't live without it,"I broke both my leg and ankle this past summer and my Physical Therapist recommended this cream to me - they were actually using it on me in their facility. I use it day and night and it definitely seems to help. In fact, I've just started to use it on my hand because I'm suffering with carpal tunnel and trigger finger. Traumeel seems to help calm things down and help reduce the need for pain medicine."
1,Doesn't help lower back pain,"I tried a free sample of this cream on my lower back and it felt the same as if I had rubbed any cream on my back. It really don't make any difference in helping my lower back pain. Maybe it is good for other types of pain, but it hasn't done anything for me."
4,Great product,Great for arthritis. Use it faithfully. Also use it for sore muscles. Gives the relief that I need. Recommend it!
2,Disappointed,"I was hoping that this product would help with my sciatica. Unfortunately, itdid not work for me. Would not buy again at $19."
5,Comforting,"I've been using this in conjunction with Traumeel tablets, with very good results. I have bilateral hip spurs and Traumeel ointment massaged over the painful areas is very effective. In fact, any arthritic joint benefits from a nice massage. It also has no odor and isn't greasy; the warmth begins immediately and feels really good. It's like a heating pad in a tube!"
5,Nice Scissors!,"I know that these are $$$ but I think that they're worth the money. They're really sharp and cuts everything with ease. I love knives and scissors of this brand in general. Ergonomic, comfy to hold. Always pretty good quality. I haven't had the same luck with Wusthof scissors. I bought another pair of Henckels to take out with me to cut food for my 20-month-old. Love them too!"
3,yippey ky yay,"die hard is an average film,it's a high explosive action movie starring bruce willis in his best performance,its about a building under hostage with german terriostes but john mclahn becomes the hero and saves the day.the first 20 min of the movie is bloody boreing"
3,too long,"this movie has some great action scenes, but is way to long. It is two hours and ten minutes. They could have easily trimmed it down to less than two hours without sacrificing action."
2,DIE HARD has no value of life...,"But that's not my complaint. John McTiernan's only film worth seeing is PREDATOR (1987). That Schwarzenegger film has action, suspense, humor, and intensity. Now why would I think that DIE HARD possesed the same qualities? Proves to be a major disappointment, and Willis should've used his sixth sense before signing on and reading the script. However, if you've never heard Reginald (""Family Matters"")Vel Johnson curse, then you have got to see this [...]. Are there any good movies out there?"
2,OK,"Hollywood's idea of action entertainment, meaning constant, numbing explosions, cartoon heroes, and forced comic relief. Rickman is a fine actor who shows flashes, but the screenplay never quite develops him into a match for the best Bond villains."
2,Duh Hard,I thougth the movie was highly overrated. Here are the worst things about the movie: 1) Bruce Willis is in it. 2) It made Bruce Willis famous. 3) It's too long. 4) It's so predictable. 5) Bruce Willis tries to act (I think; It's hard to tell)
4,die hard collector's edition,"Over all, a good purchase. it arrived ahead of schedule and in the overall condition stated. Is a relatively old DVD, so not quite mint with slight wear, but was sealed in package, had booklet, and the discs were not scratched and were in perfect order."
5,Cool!,"Best cop movie ever (other than Bullitt). This film put Bruce Willis on the spot. His performance did not seem made up, but as a real guy in a bad place. Alan Rickman played a great badguy and Bonnie Bedelia played a smart part as Willis's wife stuck with the other hostages. A great and believable film with a down right great director (John McTiernan) this film is all the goods. Great sound, music score and visual effects! Also superb action! Grade:A-"
5,Still Rocking After All These Years,"I just watched Die Hard for the umpteenth time, but this viewing was with my 13 year old son. I haven't watched the flick in years, but it's as good as ever. The cinematography, screenplay, and action scenes are golden, and held my son's attention as well as mine. My son was amazed at how many lines of dialogue I could say at the same time as the characters and is now eager to see the next Die Hard. I think this is in the top-3 all time of all action movies, and possibly holds the top slot alone.Yippee!"
4,"Love the Movie, Blu Ray is disappointing","Die Hard is a classic in our family. We watched it on Blu Ray for the first time last night. The audio is fine, but we agreed that the video was no better than regular dvd. If you are looking to buy this on blu ray to see an improved Die Hard, save your money."
5,best die hard ever,when I first saw this movie I loved it is so exciting it is so suspencful bruce willis is so good in it also. I saw the other die hard movies they were not as good as this one the second and third were so bad and way way to violent and way to much cusing this one has a lot of cursing too but it is so so so GOOD!!!definatly get this movie
4,Blu Ray quality,"Several reviewers have stated this is not much better than the DVD OR that it's an upconvert. Neither is true. The quality is true 1080P and looks as good as the original elements will allow. Frankly it looks as good if not better than when I first saw it, which was at USC film school, a week BEFORE the film opened! (Yeah, I was one of the first in America to see it, followed by a Q&A; with McTiernan afterwards.)Oh yeah, also -- I'm a post-production encoding tech, I stare/compare SD to HD transfers all night long at my job, I know the difference. In fact, in many cases, I'm one of the guys in the chain QCing the picture you see in your homes.If you wanna see a bad Blu Ray that really is just a lousy SD upconvert, then buy ""Silence of the Lambs,"" an indefensible move by MGM video. I'm writing them now and sending that blu ray back for credit."
4,Diet,"Despite a lacklustre set of DVD extras, and a better-value boxed set, this is the most essential of the 'Die Hard' films. Influential enough to spawn a genre of itself (even today, certain films are 'a bit like Die Hard'), this film combined the '70s disaster movie with a fashionable set of chic european bad guys and a plot which saw a lone hero use wit, courage and an MP5 to defeat a numerically-superior opposing force. Put like that, the film sounds merely adequate, but the beauty is in the execution - 'Die Hard' is polished. It looks and sounds gorgeous, and is paced so that, after a short introduction, it's constant action until the finale. It took Bruce Willis a decade of solid work to step from the shadow of his John McClane character. Only Willis' hair and the awful, awful trailer have dated from 1988."
5,One of the most exciting movies ever!,"First, I was blown away at the quality of this movie. Very clear and smooth. The difference between the trailer and the actual movie is incredible! Second, the Dolby Surround in this movie is top notch! Die Hard is a ""you are stupid if you don't buy this"" movie."
2,Dies Real Hard on Blu-Ray,"Let me start by first saying that I am a hugh DIE HARD fan, all of them for that matter. They rank amoung my favorite action movies of all time. OK, now for my opinion of the Blu Ray which is reflected with 2 stars. There is no value here - seriously, if you have it on DVD stick with that. I was extremely disappointed when I watched the Blu-Ray as I was expecting the colors to pop and they don't. The audio did however sound somewhat better. Skip this one on Blu-Ray and pick up Casino Royale, now that is a 5 star Blu-Ray."
1,What the hell is THIS?!,"I hate Fox. They're re-releasing all their films. First they did it with Dodgeball, I Robot, Man on Fire and The Day After Tomorrow. Now they're doing it with Die Hard, Planet of the Apes, Fight Club and other films. WITH NO NEW SPECIAL FEATURES!This DVD is EXACTLY the same as the one included in the ""Die Hard Trilogy"" pack. It's a scam. The same DVDs packaged in a new case, so the die-hard fans will feel as though they have to buy them in order to complete ""the collection.""DO NOT BE FOOLED! This has already been released. If you have Die Hard: Five Star Collection, you already own this movie. DO NOT fall for their scam."
5,The Best Action Movie Ever,"This movie should be a classic. Obviously, those who make the lists for the Cops and Robbers section and the action hero section have not seen this movie. The action is intense! A must have for any action fan. In the words of John McLane, ""Yippie Kie yay mother f$%^&*!"""
5,Yippie Ki Yea Mother F****r,"Truly one of Bruce Willis' best performances of his career. I think that Die Hard is one of the best action movies of all time. Every Christmas Eve I sit down and watch Die Hard from beginning to end. And this past Christmas I noticed something, how old Bruce Willis looks. That is, in his recent films. In fact, I hardly could recognize him. Can't wait till Die Hard 4 comes out."
5,The greatest action movie ever?,"""Die Hard"" very well may be. Released in 1988, it was a groundbreaking success, spawning far too many imitations to count. Bruce Willis plays John McClane, a New York cop caught up in the wrong place and the worst time: he's alone in a skyscraper, up against a dozen well-armed terrorists, led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman playing one of cinema's greatest villains). What follows are some of the most exhilarating action sequences I've ever seen in a movie: the rooftop shootout, the famous ""elevator shaft"" scene, the helicopter explosion, and the final death of the bad guy.Make no mistake: this movie rocks. The acting is pretty good for an action movie. Willis is fantastic as the protagonist, Rickman is slightly unsettling as the ruthless villain. All of the smaller roles are memorable as well. ""Die Hard"" is the best of its kind."
5,A Classic,"I have always loved this movie, and judging by the fact it still is not yet a free rental, so have many others."
4,Good movie,This movie was nice to see again. It was very entertaining. Wanted to watch all Die Hard movies again with new one coming out.
5,"Best ""Christmas Movie"" Ever",Action Packed with great one liners. A true holiday classic. Bruce Willis at his youngest and best is a delight!
4,the halloween of the action films,just like what halloween did to horror this did to action it set the rules and cliches for all action that came after it just like speed is die hard but in a bus is like how friday the 13th is halloween but in a summer camp. the film is really good i would reccomend it
4,really good but can't compar with die hard with a vengence.,The first die hard is exiting and has good directing but doesn't compare to Die hard with a vengence's exceptioal acting and roller coaster thrills. I recomend this film to anyone who is a hardcore action movie fan Also you should really get die hard with a vengence.
4,Great Classis that is only better on Blu-ray,"I bought this Blu-ray when it went on sale. Best blind buy ever. I had never seen the movie before, so I took a long shot and ordered it anyways. Great action, great storyline, great picture quality, and great audio quality. I was so happy with my purchase, that now I want all the Die Hard's.So go ahead take a chance, Die Hard on Blu-ray is a must see."
1,inapropriate,"I bought this for my three year old and was shocked to see how violent and filthy it was. The ""F"" word was used many times and there were many scenes with shooting and death and violence.Terible. By the way, I'm posting my name the way it is so nobody will know my E-mAil address."
3,Great movie + DVD loose inside case = Scratches,"I love this movie. One of my all time favorites. I already had this movie on DVD but wanted to get another copy b/c the one I have is old and a bit scratch up. And when this item arrived, the DVD inside was loose and I knew it would have dinks and scratches on the underside of the disc and therefore defeated the whole purpose of buying a new copy. I'm having to reorder again. Since the price was only $9.71 after shipping charge, its probably not worth sending this one back."
3,Die Hard fan--but,"I gave this movie 3 stars because of the main character: the F bomb. If constant, and I mean, constant four letter words offend you then do not buy this movie. I have to watch it in French just so I can get through it. Other than that, it's a great movie classic."
3,Die *#!^ Hard,"This is the first time I have seen this movie but did see the latest Die Hard movie. I found the language to be very expletive driven. I have seen other action movies which didn't have such a bad vocabulary. I bought the movie because I liked Live Free or Die Hard. I liked the Bruce Willis character much better in the sequel. I actually bought this film to see Alan Rickman. Mr. Rickman was so good as Hans Gruber. I can see why he was hired as a bad guy in some further movies (yes, I know he played villains on stage but I didn't see them)."
5,Best Action Movie EVER!,Best Action Movie EVER! Bruce Willis killing terrorists and the guy who played Carl Winslow on Family Matters? How could it be bad?
4,Five Star Treat!!!Yum,"Great dvd,Etras rock,Bruce is cool,FiveStar delicious! Get this DVD now, Big up respect to fox for this release."
5,You're not buying this DVD just for its charming personality,"DIE HARD is without a doubt, the most superior action movie of the eighties and the top ten of my movies of all time. The transfer is exceptional. The sound is the best! Bullets, booms, screams overwhelm you. One thing I love that I think all DVD's should have is a segment that explains the need for widescreen in maintaining the director's vision. Several trailers and T.V. spots, audio and text commentary tracks, state-of-the-art animated menus, outtakes/deleted scene reel, magazine articles, and. . . an editing room for scenes from the movie! Here is a disc that does justice for a movie that does the action genre justice!"
4,It's the original super cop!,"A classic in the genre of action and for those who hate Christmas movies, think outside the box and pick up this unlikely holiday joy ride!"
4,An Action Packed Christmas Eve!!!,"This is a really awesome movie with great action, and great actors! Some terrorists have taken control of Nakatomi Plaza and only one man can stop them; John McClane! He's a loose cannon cop that doesn't play by the rules! Can John kill the bad guys, save his wife, and make it out alive to celebrate Christmas? I highly recommend DIE HARD!!!"
4,Third one's better!! This is good!!!,"The 3rd of this series is the best, which is unusual. This one's better than the 2nd though, huge disapointment with the 2nd one. Anyhow, terrorists take over the Nakatomi Plaza, leader of this is Alan Rickman. Jon Maclean(Bruce Willis) is on a vacation there to see his wife. He's a New York cop, he's the only weapon against these terroritsts. He tries everything to get the dumb cops to listen, except one, who listens and is determined to protect John Maclean, from the other dumb cops. A good movie, 2 thumbs up. Watch this and the 3rd, the 2nd one isn't worth it!!"
1,TERRIBLE BLU RAY TRANSFER!,"I am just reviewing the Blu Ray Disc. The quality is awful. Somehow I had to change the colours in my Sony LCD X series several times to watch the movie with some satisfaction. Mostly it reminded me of video transfer. There are some moments of grain,blur and to what I felt was audio drop.Die Hard with a Vengeance faired much better which prompted me to buy this one as well. They should be more mindful than this before releasing a movie on a new format which boasts superior pic quality.I know it's a 80's movie but still there is no excuse for the drop in visual quality."
5,die hard,this is it! this is the one... this is where it all started!! he just wanted to protect his wife from impending doom... and now he turned out to be one of hollywood's major action characters in the history of cinema. long live john maclane!!!
4,classic,"If you're reading this review... wow. Get this, watch it, and so many cultural references will make so much more sense. Best watched with beer and buddies."
5,a great start to the series,"I think what makes Die Hard rise above other action films of the 80s is that the hero is just a regular guy. At the time, Willis was known mainly for comedy films, so having him be an action hero let the audience actually wonder if he would make it out, unlike Stallone and Arnold's indestructible, muscle bound supermen. When McClane gets hurt, he has the injury for the rest of the film. Another thing that makes this film great is the claustrophobia. Even though it's a big building, you can't help but notice the chances of McClane and a terrorist happening upon each other are significantly increased. Also, unlike its sequels, which are also very good in their own right, there is no gaping hole in the bad guys' plan. The plot, as far as I can tell, is airtight. You'll be guarenteed a good time with Die Hard."
5,"""Gosh, I hope that's not a hostage!""","Everyone else has pretty much covered how great this film is. I just want to make an observation as to how this movie differs from other less realistic and subpar action films:The terrorists didn't kill one another off. Why is it that in every action film the lead terrorist kills off his cohorts at the end. Oh, not only is he evil, but he's not a team player. In this film the bad guys are a team. They were smarter than the good guys. Hans, Marco, Karl, Tito, Jermaine...the terrorists have names and faces as opposed to Rambo style films where 50 people are shot down in five minutes.Also, the DVD is great. I never saw this film in theaters and without that annoying PAN and SCAN, Die Hard is much more effective and exciting."
4,An outer space ABC book,An excellent book that introduces the concepts of outer space and the alphabet all at once. Well done!
5,Fabulous!,"I own a lot of cookbooks, and this one is just fabulous! My spouse has a valid complaint about how long it takes me to make dinner, and with this cookbook fab food can be on the table in a half hour. Food good enough to serve to company, tasty, elegant, simple."
5,Great!!,"Fabulous photography and deliciously modern, easy to achieve recipes. Makes a beautiful gift, but be sure to buy one for yourself!"
5,Good looks and personality!,Brilliantly delicious photographs- a real inspiration to get you cooking! (looks good on the coffee table too!) As for the food... mmmm
4,Insider's Perspective!,I enjoyed this book. It was very interesting to hear about Sammy's life and lifestyle from his child's perspective. The book was written in an uplifting manner. I do wish the author had gone into more detail regarding her brothers' & mother's lives and feelings on things. It's a fast read!
3,Has It's Weaknesses,"The reminisences of her childhood as Sammy Davis Jr.'s only bloodchild is interesting ""remember, you're a Davis"" and adds interesting insight. However, this book is marred by her obvious hatred and long tangents against Altovise, the third Mrs. Sammy Davis, Jr.(which is clearly due to the fact that her mother was the second Mrs. Davis) If you over look this, it makes a good read."
2,Sorting trays too small,The trays were much smaller than I expected. I have sorting trays in my classroom. They are much larger. So I thought the trays ordered would be just as large.
4,Does what it supposed to,Don't drive this vehicle much but so far holding up .I went to electric to eliminate priming when I use it.
1,poor quality fuel pump,"paid $52 plus tax for this POS, it lasted less than 500 miles, professionally and correctly mounted. Don't waste your time or money on this item, Airtex used to be a great product line, not this one. i gave it one star because you can't give 0"
1,Wrong Pump,"The same as the other pump. Right picture on the box wrong part in the box. I need the one in tank, not external!"
1,pay for less than what you get,I justed needed something to play a little music while I'm working on stuff by this little speaker is a pain. It runs on batteries so I had to go get them but they burned out super fast and batteries are expensive. I couldn't hear the music good when I'm cooking or doing much because the speakers aren't very loud. I didn't expect a really nice one but this is pure garbage. spent a little more and get one you can actually put to use.
4,chess set,"I like smaller chest sets. So this one jumped out at me. I would spraycan gloss finish the pieces right away, otherwise they start to chip a little. Gives it some character though. I enjoy the set to this day. Also had to add some foam and felt for the pieces inside, they sort of roll around free in the stone box.The color they show here is not exaclty what I got. The black was true black, not gold."
3,"Service was fine, but did not help me","Received quickly, packaged well, all that, but it did not help my hip and leg. No effect. Some arthritis in hip. Went to chiropractor and found out my hips were out of alignment and I am now much better."
5,BEST,"BEST works like magic. It is not greasy, no smell, completly natural, and works in 24 hrs like night and day difference. a magic healer. I bought 10000 of this item using it for everything, cooking to hot bath to rub to massage to cleaning tables."
1,Now a days anyone could write and publish.,"Mr. Paolo Novaresio's book ""The Explorers"" is of no academic value, unfortunately his book has lots to desire for when it comes to academic history. It leaves me no doubt that the author lacks a graduate level academic degree and research tactics. My suspicions leave me to believe that he only has an education degree and not an academic one, and he is tried very hard to navigate in the academia world without any success. In Paolo's book the explorers he barely mentioned the Spanish and Portuguese explorers (and when he does he propagate the 'Black Legend') of which outnumbered by far the English and Dutch Explorers. And when it comes to the ancient world explorers all I could say is that a secondary private school student could do much better research work than Paolo Novaresio"
4,A Look-at-life movie with eye-catching camera techniques.,"After reading ""authorized"" reviews, you'd have to expect that the movie will be a bore. Afterall, what could you expect from a movie based on a letter written shortly after WWII? I, on the other hand, would like to comment differently. Yes, the plot was fairly weak, but the use of the camera angles, lighting, and cutting to enhance the story was well done. No one can say that the actors did not do a fine job of defining their characters. They were well portrayed and counterweighted the weak story. I congratulate the makers of this film for taking what little story they had and created a movie that was not only entertaining, but made you think as well."
4,This movie is perfect for the restless.,"I know very little about the Beat culture and have never read anything by Kerouac, but I still enjoyed this movie. And as other reviewers have said before, the movie doesn't really have a ""point"" and it's not trying to change your views on the world. What it is doing is telling a story about a young man who is fighting with himself. Neal Cassidy, at the point in his life this movie captures, is torn between a self that wants to settle down with a wife and kid and live in a house with a picket fence, and a self that wants to escape with few ties and see what exactly the world can offer him. I think it's a story that many people can relate to. I, personally, loved the movie. I enjoyed the way in which the told the story, I loved the music, and I thought the actors were fantastic."
5,The legend lives on,"This is by far the best movie ever made.Thomas Jane portrays my hero Neal,exactly the way I would have envisioned him.If they put Jacks'""On The Road"" on screen,he would definately be the prime candidate for Dean Moriarty.{Neal}I had this on order about a year before it finally came out,and I reccomend it to anyone who ever just jumped in a car and yelled""GO CAT,GO"" What kicks are to be had when living free,but there is a price. For those who did not know,........Neal Died on the railroad tracks in Mexico wile out having kicks."
1,Incomprehensible,"Ok, Jack Kerouac's writings may not be the easiest to follow, but this film is worse. What IS going on here? Beats me. The film-maker was more interested in stylization than story-telling. I gave up after about 30 mins, which is 25 more than a movie deserves if it gets off to a thud like this one."
5,Outstanding!,"I love James Quinlan. To me, this is the finest and best in this FBI-based mystery/romance series by Coulter. I have re-discovered Coulter because of this series and love most of what I've read. I especially like the spunkiness of Sally and the tenderness and intelligence of Quinlan. We are introduced briefly to Dillon Savich, who is prominent in the rest of the series. I would love to see more of Quinlan as a major character, though."
1,Terrible!,"Whenever I am off from school and have nothing better to do, I either go to the bookstore or the library and get a pile of Catherine Coulter books. Unfortunately, this time I got my hands on ""The Cove"". I was a bit taken aback from the very beginning, because the hero was not given any depth. Random thoughts and descriptions of other peoples' perception of the man were the only clue given to the reader about his personality. It would have been funny had it not been so painfully annoying and boring. The heroine was a very odd character. She had no depth and all I could discern about her was that she was confused and acted pretty stupid, despite Coulter's attempts at infusing some intelligence into the woman. I would recommend that no one read this book, because it will probably only result in a headache and a lot of wasted time. Read the ""Bride"" series by Coulter. Those books actually seem like romance novels."
2,This book is just too ridiculous...,"I've been starving for good murder mysteries lately and I can't get enough of them. This book does not fall into that category. I read this book all the way through, but I wouldn't have if it hadn't been for all the crazy stuff that happened, which I guess kept it from being completely boring. It really was just ridiculous. I think it was very poorly written, somtimes hard to read/understand, and conversations between characters were too lengthy and sometimes one sided. Just a silly, silly book. Because of this, I will probably never pick up another book by Catherine Coulter."
1,Not Coulter's best,"I've read some of Coulter's historical romance novels, and enjoyed them, but this is not one of her better efforts. I'm halfway through the book, and am persisting only to find out the solution to the mystery. The characterizations are inconsistent--at times, characters change attitudes practically mid-sentence. I half-expect the villains to be wearing top hats, capes, and twirling black mustaches. The dialogue is amateurish and silly. I know that she has re-written other books of hers, and I think that this one needs the same treatment, because it reads like a book written by an adolescent who only imagines what adults say and do. I will probably try one more in this series to see if the books improve, but not until I ""cleanse my palate"" with a few other books. ETA: I have now finished it, and the ending was so contrived that it really wasn't worth my time--time I'll never get back."
2,What is the deal with these books?,"I think this is now the 4th FBI book I've read of Catherine Coulter's (out of order) and I'm not sure why. What the heck is the deal with all these men proposing before they've even kissed the girl? How far-fetched is that? I guess I like a little more intrigue and less romance in my books. I'm not sure why I've bothered to read 4 of them. I like Dillon and Savich but the dialogue is often just weird, and like I said, the whole idea of proposing so quickly just seems lame. But if you like that stuff, these would probably be all great books."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This book was f'ing horrible! I couldn't even get through it. I know it was written in the mid-90s but come on. The way the characters talked was irritating. Who the hell says ""Damnation"" anyways? The heroine - if you can call her that - was flimsy and not substantive at all. I found it hard to believe that a determined FBI agent would fall for her. Whatever the ""mystery"" was it didn't hook me at all. Everything felt disjointed. I'm thinking the latter part of the series may be better since its more contemporary, but I don't know if I'll ever get to it. Definitely skip this one!"
1,Really?,"This is the most ridiculous book I have ever read. I wouldn't know where to begin to try and explain all the things that I didn't like about this story or the way it was told. It was simply beyond belief. That there was any positive reviews just goes to show, to each his own."
2,Tired and Untrue,"I used to like Catherine Coulter's books quite a bit. But I have to say that ""The Cove"" was so contrived that I could barely finish it. The romance was weak, the plot overblown and unrealistic. Plus, the heroine was so stupid she set my teeth on edge. Every move she made seemed like a ploy to keep the book from ending when it should have...on page 50. I'm sorry to say it, but if you want good romantic suspense, go with Linda Howard's ""Now You See Her"". You'll never be satisfied with this stuff again."
3,Decent start to the series...keep going!,"This first book in the series is interesting but there are a few challenges. Most of the characters were fleshed out pretty well and there were quite a few plot twists to keep you turning the page. The pace was near perfect. What kept it from being rated a 4 was a somewhat stilted dialogue at times, especially between Susan/Sally and Quinlan. I often found it problematic to make some of the emotional shifts, which seemed to come out of the blue.Despite the above, this is an interesting story and one I'm glad to have read...enough for me to move on to the next in the series."
2,Sad,"Book started out okay, although I didn't sympathize with Sally/Susan too much. One minute she's smart enough to escape a pschiatric hospital by hiding drugs under her tongue. Next she's too stupid to not be found whenever she runs. She was an idiot. I don't like when women are constantly weak, frail, pathetic, and stupid."
1,"Trite, trite, trite.",This is a less than one star book. It is a waste of time and effort. A huge disappointment. I is just Awful!
1,childish,"This book is a good example of why authors like Elizabeth George, Ursula Hege, Michal Connelly are enjoyed so much. ""The Cove"" was childish, no suspense, and where the author says on the cover that ""Yes, I actually scared myself a couple of times"", I have to wonder what it was she read.I'm disgusted with myself for wasting the time that it took to read it!"
1,"Interesting plot, poor writing","The plot of this book was interesting if implausible. However, the dialogue and timing were odd and choppy. Not well written"
1,Ridiculous!,"I wasted too much time on this book thinking there must be some great ending. Wrong. The main character narrowly escapes two evil men in her life to instantly blow her cover and fall in love with someone else almost as soon as she meets him. I'm sorry, but I don't think the woman would be thinking ANYTHING about love and romance at this point in her life and I don't think she would trust another man for a LONG time. This book has too many ridiculous, unbelieveable twists and turns. If they were believeable it would be OK. It just seemed like it was written by someone with no experience with the attitude ""now what else can I make happen to her?"" Ridiculous, boring, and down-right stupid in my opinion."
4,Please...,I don't know why but I could not get into this book and I love this author. I tried twice. I'll try again in a year.
2,the cove,this a fair writeing. A little outside natural thinking. I am not excited about the authors next wrti=eing. Some things are just out of my mental reach. Sorry
3,very different,"This book really surprised me, I wasn;t expecting the way it was written, or the way the plot went at the very end."
2,Not my type of book,"I have to say that I read this book very quickly because I wanted to see how it would end. Had I known there was going to be sexual violence in it, I certainly wouldn't have read it. I know it's fiction but still, it is very far-fetched. Everytime something happened to the ""heroine"" I kept thinking ""oh not again!""... the bad things kept happening and happening and it was like ""oh, just get ON with the story please"". Really, if you want to read a mystery, read Agatha Christie. No sex, no violence just classic mystery."
1,Why do I do this to myself??!!!!,"I know her books make me mad when I'm done...yet I keep reading them, WHY ME????This book had the typical 2 plot storyline where one doesn't really have to do with the other. This book contained evil geriatrics, sadistic ""fathers"", a weak-kneed woman, and a hunky-yet-burdened- FBI agent. Put that all together, and you've got the COVE...I have to give her kudos, though, she keeps you interested, but the pay off is like buying $100 lottery tickets and winning nothing."
3,The Cove.....it just lacks something!,"I started reading this book and I thought wow...a book that talks about ""The Worlds Greatest Icecream"" how could it be bad? Well the more I read, it seems the more bored I became. I think this book could've been ended about 100 pages before it did. I think that most of this book is so unrealistic, it almost makes it hard for you to develop pictures in your mind, of the story. I'm going to read The Maze. I haven't given up on Catherine yet. I enjoyed Dillion Savich, he seems like in future books he will be one to be reckoned with. I also like James Quinlan. As for most of the other characters, they were just blah! The book is ok, if your into long reads where you absolutely get nothing out of the book, but if your looking to remember this one for awhile, maybe you should pass by it and read something else!"
2,Hmmm.,"I'm not sure if it is just the Kindle version, but there were so many errors. Missing words, misspellings and grammatical errors that detract from smooth reading. Plot is ok, but not developed well. Some parts are hard to follow, where conversations have one character speaking two paragraphs so you have to re read to who is saying what. Again, this distracts from the story. In other words, I had to put the book down (as opposed to couldn't put down), and the sad part of it was not the story, it was tiring to read."
1,Horrible!!!,Looking for a new author to read and made the mistake of checking this one out. This book was horrible! I read for about an hour and decided to not punish myself by reading the rest of the book.Completely far fetched and dialogue very boring.
2,"""Saturday Matinee"" material","I didn't read the Coulter FBI series in order, so I know that this isn't her best work in the series. I went back to this one for background information on one of her recurring characters. It is a good ""light"" read and shows off Coulter's strengths - characters and setting of place. I FEEL like I could drive to this town and know my way around. She has a wonderful way of making you feel the wind in your face and hear it howling around the eaves of the house. As stories go, it's ""eh"". I highly recommend others in the series - The Maze, Riptide, etc."
3,Okay,This is a readible beach book. The plot is interesting and there are a few surprizes. I didn't find any of the characters likible except for the FBI agent who is the friend of the hero.There are two mysteries going on here. One involves Sally 's(the lead female) father's death and the second one is the source of the small town of Cove's income. Some of the inhabitants of Cove are very irritating and so is Sally .The actions that take place in this novel could never take place in real life. This is not a police procedural. It is an FBI fantasy novel. 2 1/2 stars.
4,Ice Cream Special,"Catherine Coulter drags you back to each romantic mystery with just enough spice to keep you reading.Senior citizens of Cove work out a revitalization program for the center of their lives. The hard work entices people to stop and enjoy the world's best ice cream, but visitors go astray and never reach their destination.Sally Brainerd, the daughter of a murdered Washington lawyer is seeking a place to hid but FBI Special Agent James Quinlan is on her trail. What they find in The Cove is not what either expected.Bedtime, beach and dentist office reading at its best.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
4,Great First-- Can't wait to read the rest of the series,"I read incredibly fast and so I am always looking for a good read by an author that has published many titles (so I have somewhere to go if I like the book). This is the first in the ""FBI Series"" Coulter writes. It's pretty good. The plot moves quickly, and definitely has you guessing at the end about what is happening in this sleepy little town they call ""The Cove"". Some of it's a little unbelievable, but that's okay with me. I liked it enough to pick up a couple more of her books in this series. I would recommended it to anyone who enjoys romantic suspense."
4,Great beginning to a great series,The Cove introduces characters that are very compelling. This book is a really entertaining read and sets up the characters for the FBI series. I would recommend starting with The Cove and reading all of the books in this series in publication order.
1,I DID NOT LIKE THIS AT ALL. Audiobook.,"This book was so bad I haven't been able to read another one by this author.It was simplistic, child like and ridiculous.I can handle fiction as being unrealistic.But this was just stupid.If you want to read a good book check out Thomas Perry or Tess Gerritsen or Michael Connelly.Bypass this.If you can check it out from the library, that's okay, it won't cost you anything."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read....,"I listened to this book on CD and while the reading was good the book was one of the worst I've ever 'read'. The plot was very convoluted and the entire book needed a very heavy editorial hand, there was much repetition of past events. I thought the heroine was a mess and the entire story set my teeth on edge. This is my first read of this author and I will NOT be reading anything else by her. I love good writing (Sue Grafton, Jan Karon, Sara Paretsky, Margaret Maron etc) so I don't intend to settle for sub-standard. I think the following quote sums up my feelings: ""Reading good books ruins you for enjoying bad books""."
4,I loved it!!!,"I thought the book was great. You don't know what's going to happen until the end of the book. You feel like you know the characters in the book. Catherine Coulter describes everything in a way that makes you see it all very clearly, you can see it in your mind. I love her books."
4,Very Entertaining.,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I liked the two investigations rolled into one. I don't like books that are to easy to figure out, but this one was just about right.I like a book with twists and this had just enough to keep you doubting whether you had it figured out correctly yet or not.Will be purchasing more by Catherine Coulter."
4,Great for money.,Good for the price and seems to be good so far. Would recommend. Lightweight and I can see where the extra mount is beneficial.
3,Good basic tripod with stiff tilt,"Pros:Construction material of tripod is OK, will last for years no problems.Comes with two snap-in adapters for your cameras & camcorders, makes it very easy to swap them in and out of tripod.Built-in bubble level.Cons:The tilt adjustment is stiff and not fluid, so it is hard to make a minor adjustment if you want a quick turn. Deduct two stars for this."
2,Very flimsy,"When I received this as I was defective right out of the box. I tried to extend the center and it was wobbly and couldn't be secured. Overall, a not a good product. On the bright side, returning it was extremely easy and there were no hassles so dealing with the seller was not bad."
4,Great budget tripod,Can't really beat the price of this tripod. The base is sturdy and the level on the frame is a nice touch. The only think I don't like about it is my dSLR completely covers the level on the lock plate and the wing nut to turn the screw to attach the camera is a little flimsy. Not enough of a hassle to justify spending any more on a basic tripod though. Good buy on a budget.
1,This was my first tripod... could not be a worse start!,"I read all of reviews expecially the bad ones and inspite of people warning that it breaks very soon... I went ahead and bought it. It looked good when I first held it. But it surprised me when it broke just 20 days later! One of the clips on the leg broke, which means that the legs wont hold fast.I recommend that you avoid this tripod. I know that the price looks very tempting but believe me... it is not worth the effort. I am yet to get in touch with Sunpak to see if they are going to refund my money. There are very good tripods that cost just about sixty bucks more.I would give this item zero stars if Amazon would allow me to!"
1,Telescoping geared part stuck/broke,The tripod broke within minutes of taking it out of the box. The telescoping geared part of the tripod extended it but the gears got stuck and now they just grind when I try to roll it down. A poor design and it seems to be made out of cheap plastic from the sound of the grinding gears. The gear also seems to be at an awkward angle. I'm not sure how I'm even going to return this product because the extended tripod no longer fits in the box. What a pain.
5,A good solid tripod,"Sunpak 6601UT Tripod with Extra Quick-Release Mounting PlateI was looking for a light and easy to use tripod for nature photography with my digital camera. The Sunpak has been great for me.I especially like the quick mount. It saves time and wear. The unit comes with two, so that you can quickly swap cameras around.It is light; easy to use; and fully featured!"
5,Great value for the price,"The product arrived well packaged. Accompanied by an understandable instruction sheet. The tripod is quite sturdy and easy to erect, use, and refold. For an amateur photographer that has occasional use for a tripod, I think this is as good as you're going to get for the price. What I bought here certainly negates any negative reviews I read. The ratio of the weight of the tripod to the weight capacity for the camera is excellent. I highly recommend it."
5,Excellent value! money well spent!!,"I was considering spending $95 for a sturdy tripod but felt it was too much of money to spend on a tripod so decided to check out this model.Since this model was much cheaper than the one I had my eyes on, I was skeptical about its build quality. You shouldn't. This is a very well made and sturdy product. They even include extra quick release platform with bubble level (so you know if the camcorder is placed even). This is really handy if you have more than one camera or have both camera & camcorder. You can just quickly release camera without screwing/unscrewing from the tripod. I am sure you can find better built tripod but this unit does the job for a casual user like me. I highly recommend this unit and considering its price, it's a bargain!"
4,Good budget tripod,"For a Jackson it's about as good as it gets. The only major complaint I have is that the turning lever is positioned so that when it's turned, it can easily get knocked into other extensions of the tripod."
4,Decent Tripod,"For the price you can't really complain, this tripod does the job.Nothing fancy, a bit shaky fully extended but looks nice, lightweight and efficient."
1,Broke after only using twice,"Expect what you pay for. The soft, cheap plastic does not hold up, even after very light use. I only used this a couple of times inside, never outside, and only for taking a couple of photos. The plastic sleeve with the thumbscrew to hold the center post in place snapped off in my hand without applying anything but the lightest pressure. Too late to return to Amazon, and to get it replaced or repaired by Sunpak involves me paying for postage. Not worth it. I will try and fix it with super glue, but don't expect it to be the same. Not recommended, spend a little more and get a real tripod."
4,Good for my spotting scope,I got this for my spotting scope - the tripod legs are collapsible so it's compact and there are several adjustment knobs to help position the scope. It feels very steady and seems to be good quality. No complaints. It comes with a second shoe you can put on a second item in case you want to quickly change devices.
2,cheap plastic,The handle that you crank to raise and lower the camera mounting plate is so flimsy it feels like I could break it off with very little effort. I'm still able to use it by grabbing it at the bast of the arm and turning it. Besides that it is a fine tripod.
2,"Good features, poor quality.","The tripod is not terrible. Good rotation on 3 axis. Good height extension, it's lightweight and the quick release plates are very handy. Unfortunately the locking mechanism for one of the legs gave out on me the 4th or 5th time that I used it. Also because of it's light weight it's a little jittery (especially with a DSLR and long lens attached) and probably needs a 5lb sandbag to keep it steady in a moderate wind."
4,Good Value Tripod,"I bought this tripod for its price and because I didn't need anything too special...just something to get the job done. I have been quite satisfied with this one so far, expecially the quick-release mounting mechanism that I can use for multiple cameras (since two of these plates come in the package, you don't need to keep unscrewing it from one camera and screwing it into the other one). It feels relatively sturdy and solidly made, although a hook at the end of the central rod would be nice to allow you to hang your gear bag or a weight from if you want extra stability. Does the job it was designed for and is a good deal at less than $30!"
3,Adequate tripod,"This tripod is adequate. It's of a fairly sturdy construction with the vertical crank being the exception. The crank feels like it could easily break. Otherwise, it operates smoothly and it is pretty solid. By all means you can get a higher quality tripod, but you will spend 3x or more money on that unit. Good product for the price."
1,Not good,"I still haven't received this item. I ordered on 08/20/09 and I never received it.Dr. Susan's Girls-Only Weight Loss Guide: The Easy, Fun Way to Look and Feel Good!"
5,I'm a FAN!,"I only read this book since it was so highly recommended by a friend, who shares the same taste in books as I do. As it would turn out - the recommendation was right on the money. I was hooked from the first chapter, and couldn't set the book down until I had finished. It was captivating. The characters were believable and the plot intriguing. Fantastic! I'm a new fan of Ms. parker's, and intend to read everything she's ever written and will write in the future!"
1,BAD BUNDLE,The battery I received does not fit into my Blackberry Curve and the car charger does not work.
1,VERY OFFENSIVE,"I am Hispanic, yet I have natural blond hair, green eyes and fair skin. My ancestors were Hispanic, and they had light hair, eyes, and skin. I find it offensive that these puppet sets are supposed to be ""typical"" of ethnic backgrounds, and find them in very poor taste."
1,Sad book for kids,"It is a shame this book is geared for young children since it is so macabre. If your elementary aged kid wants to read about kidnapping, terror, depression, murder, and capital punishment, then read this book. Put ""American Girl"" on it and then you find it in the classroom."
4,A Great Book,"My book reveiw is a great book that everybody will like. It givesgreat descriptions, and alot of similes. If you like history mysteries, this is the book for you. Also this book has alot of characters. There are maides that sovle the crime and bad villains. The cool part is that in this mystery, you solve along the way, it also has a good ending, that's why the book is for you."
3,Mysteries in Glasshouse,"This book is about Merry and some glassmakers. One of the glassmakers is her friend,Angelo. His book is stolen and glass is broken in the Glasshouse. Merry has to find out who did it. In the begging it's slow, but at the end it is very good. I would recomend the book because it is exiting."
2,"Broke, not as strong as looks","This trowel looks great, nice soft touch handle and is aluminum so it won't rust.. so why 2 stars? I have used it only a few times, and it did reasonably well, then, all of a sudden it shattered at the handle. Usually trowels will bend, but the aluminum scoop is over what looks to be some kind of carbony shaft that attaches to handle, and it just snapped in two... I think if you use this in any kind of clay/rocky soil you would be better off going with something forged. good luck!"
4,Strong,This little trowel is still going strong.. has not rusted or been bend from digging even in some harder soil...
3,Good for what I bought it for!,"If you are looking for a high-quality shovel, that will last through gardening, digging holes, a bit of rough and tough use, this is NOT the shovel you want. It is extremely lightweight and I would imagine bend at the first rock I hit in the garden.However, that is not why I bought this shovel...I have two big dogs that have free roam of the backyard :D I need to pick up after them and wasn't willing to spend a lot of money on shovel for that job. So, for that use, it's perfect. I gave 3 stars b/c there could be different uses for different folks...wanted those who were looking for a heavy-duty shovel to be aware..."
1,Disappointed,These shears are most unsatisfactory. They do not cut anything but the tenderest of grass blades and are tiring and uncomfortable to use. I gave up on them and regret the purchase.
3,Good tool but needs tweeking - not good for short persons,"This is a good tool but it needs some tweeking to make it great. The handle is too long for a short person, it should be adjustable along the length. The blade should also swivel a full circle (ball joint) to allow for lawn edging, as it is now designed you have to stand directly over the area being cut with the blade straight downward - very painful to the sholders especially with the handles been too long for the petite gardener"
2,Oliver,This DVD did not come with the CD as advertised. My daughter was very disappointed and I felt mislead. I specifically bought this item because it was a DVD/CD combo.
5,Leisa Hart is the best instructor,"I have done 225 videos in 12 years and find Leisa Hart to be the best of the best, she is a great instructor and the Fit To The Core videos are very very good. My body is getting definition in areas that before were defined as ugly! I have some muscles appearing in my abs and buttie and feel energized. Leisa's other videos, the Chisel Fit To The Core and her Gym in A Box are the other two videos I am using to lose weight...she is the best."
2,Would not recommend them,"We bought these letters for our daughter, and although she does have a lot of fun playing with them, and I love using them to review letters, half of them do not stick to our refrigerator! (We live in an apartment, so it is not the newest refrigerator, but all of our other magnets stick to it very well.) They are a great size, very colorful, and fun to play with, but I can't recommend something with magnetic in the name, when you try to put them on the refrigerator, and half of them slide down and on to the floor. They were not that expensive, and my daughter spends a lot of time playing with them (on the floor), so I guess they were worth the money, but I would not buy another set, and I would certainly not buy a set as a gift."
1,I don't recommend this,"I bought these magnetic letters so my grandkids could play with them on our refrigerator. They don't stick, but slide down the refrigerator. The magnets are too small and too weak. I will be tossing these, and trying the Melissa & Doug wooden magnetic letters instead."
2,Weak Magnets,"The good:The letters are bigThey are colorfulThere are enough letters to make some simple wordsThe BadThe magnets are very weakTwo letters won't stick to my fridgeThe company won't replace individual letters, you have to send the whole bucket back to amazon.In my opinion, these letters aren't worth the hassle."
1,Pointless!,"The whole point of my buying these was so they would stick to the refrigerator and the kids could play with them. Half of them fell off right away, the other half slowly slid down until they fell off. Not good! They did stick slightly better to our dishwasher which has a very smooth surface, but still met with the same fate (sliding to the floor). They are nice colors, thick enough plastic....but really! The magnets SHOULD stick to metal, right?! Don't waste your time."
2,weak magnets,some of the letters will not stay attatched to the fridge other appliances. my grandson does enjoy the letters that do stick.
4,"Ok magnets, but some are too heavy for the magnets to hold","These magnets are ok, but the larger ones like M and W don't stick very well as the two small magnets can't quite do the job."
3,Bad B,I bought these for my grandson to play with. His name is Jacob and the only B in the container won't stick to fridge. I am very disappointed
3,Magnets are weak,"I was very excited about getting these letters for my 18 month old. However, so of the magnets are weak and they do not stick well. I expected more for the price."
4,"They are plastic magnetic letters, what could be wrong?","We bought for a one year old to play with onthe fridge, so we are happy to see that the magnets are pretty well secured. We took out some of the smaller letters which could be a choking hazard. These ARE NOT rated for kids that age, so we use only when supervised."
3,Not the best or the strongest magnets,I use it on my whiteboard in my classroom. Not enough letters to be all that useful. I'd shop around.
4,Decent,"Our 1 year old loves them and they're a lot of fun when friends come over. The magnets aren't the strongest, but they hold themselves up...barely."
2,Magnetic alaphabet,Half of the letter magnets seem to not hold them on the fridge. reallyu that is my only complaint. Just a poain when i open the fridge and a bunch fall off.
3,Ambitious book; depends on what you're looking for...,"I went into this book without any true knowledge of the conflict in the Middle East and what made Jerusalem such a holy but yet disputed city. The book did answer my questions and gave me lots of the key information about the birth of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The author focuses on using architecture and history of the major monuments of the religions as her device to tell the story of Jerusalem.I went into reading the book as a textbook so I got the significant dates and times out of it, but the city was controlled by a different group seeminly every 10 years so the book gets tedious and dry most of the time.As an introductory look at the history of Jerusalem and more generally the battle between the Jews and the Arabs, A History Of Jerusalem is a good start."
2,Good History - But Biased,"Armstrong does a good job of showing the history of Jerusalem and how the religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam came to view the city as holy ground. It does give insight into the mid east situation today. That said, Armstrong writes from a liberal (non-faith) point of view. I think this leads her [writing] to have certain prejudices in history and the way she views these religions."
1,interesting but biased,"I have just finished reading this book and A History of God and found them both interesting but biased. Ms. Armstrong explains away all actinos and atrocities committed by Muslims while highlighting and denouncing actions taken by Christians and Jews. for example, in her view the building of mosques and other holy Islamic shrines are welcome but similar activities by Christians and Jews are considered to be ""putting facts on the ground so that they may control Jerusalem."" Repeatedly, muslims defend themselves against the aggression and atrocities of Christians and Jews but their atrocities are justified because the others acted first. I cannot vouch for her ""facts"" but I can unequivocally state that her interpretation of those ""facts"" does a strong disservice to the hope of having Muslims, Christians and Jews understand each other and find ways of creating peace."
1,Certainly not for beginners,"Currently I am reading Karen Armstong's book, Jerusalem, ""One City Three Faiths"", I have reached upto page 60 and it is has not picked any pace. There is too much information crammed within the pages that it is really hard to decipher who is doing what. It is like a maze which has started to give me a headache. Also within a single page there are too many names of person and deities that is hard to retain that information and also very little background as to how or from where they (or that)have originated.One thing can be for surely said that this is no beginners book. You have to have sufficient information on the subject before you venture out with this book. Though the book starts from the very beginning and is trying to cover as much detail as possible there is not any clarity and rather sometimes becomes quite muddy.I hope the book becomes more interesting as it moves on before I put it down and becomes one of the items on the shelf gathering dust!"
5,A very nice cup of coffee,"After having tried many of the coffee pods on the market, the Java One Sumatra Mandheling has become my personal favorite. This medium roast coffee is bold, rich, and strong, with fruity tones, but no bitterness. The pods are full, not half-filled like some other brands.Unlike many other pods which are packaged laying loose in a bag, the Java One pods are individually foil wrapped and placed in a dispensing box. The packaging ensures that every cup will be fresh, and negates the need for a separate storage container.This product is comparable to the usually more expensive Molto Sumatra Mandheling, and much better than the Senseo Sumatra Blend. If you are looking for a bold, rich coffee but do not like the bitterness often associated with dark roasts, then this is the coffee for you. If you instead prefer the milder and blander ""breakfast blend"" style coffees, then this is probably not the coffee for you."
3,Pretty Bad,"I like Too Shorts rap style, but sometimes I wish he would rap over faster beats, that's when he is at his best. That's the main problem with this album, the beats all sound the same and there all unbelievably slow. I do like the cut with B-Legit ""What Happened to the Groupies"" because B-Legit realy sounds good on this track, and because it is the fastest song on here. ""Good Life"" is the 2nd best track on here, with a happy little background. With only 11 real songs coming from Short himself, and the rest of the tracks coming from up-and-coming artists from his camp, there really isn't much to go around. Lots of weak songs, but some good ones. The guests keep this one alive somewhat. B-Legit, Daz, Eightball & MJG, Scarface, Soopafly, Jay-Z, Jermaine Dupri, E-40, Puffy, Badwayz, Slink Capone, Murda One, G-Side, Playa Playa, Zu, Al Block, Hellkilla & Quint Black. It's average.But I Wouldn't exactly recommend it."
3,Why Too Short?,"I am a rap fan of West Coast and Down South music. Automatically that means there are two bad tracks on the album. Because I am not too crazy about Puff Daddy or Jay-Z, and I definately can't stand Jermaine Dupri. They had no business being on a Too Short album. I am a Too Short fan and I know he could have done a better job. My favorite song on this album even though it is a year or two old is Don't Stop Rapping because it has a tight beat and Ball and G is ripping it."
2,what the HELL???,"too $hort too $hort too $hort.... man... he says he cant stay away... cant stay away from what?? because whatever he cant stay away from, its obviously keeping him away from releasing his album... feb. 23... jun. 23... july 13... WHATS NEXT??? sometime next milennium?? damnit $hort... we were all anticipating this.... ...it better be real damn worth the wait....because ...$hort, if we wanted to.. we COULD stay away..... just release the damn album.....amazon.com's had the track names printed out for months.. are you ashamed of your work, $hort? whats keepin it all back? i loved $horts previous albums... but no matter how good those were, none of that was worth waiting this long... and somehow $hort, i dont think youll live up. great move, $horty."
1,I never thought I'd be giving a Too $hort album 1 star...,"There was nothing better than hearing Too $hort lay down those funky tracks back in the days, but years later (man, I lost count of how many albums this guy made), I could barely listen to this CD. Don't get me wrong, it was nice to hear Too $hort's voice again and I still respect him, but this album was flat out boring and horrible. I know Too $hort is known for his non-stop ""brag-rapping,"" which he does with a fresh style, and his ""baller/pimpin hoes"" lyrics, but this time around, I just got sick of it. If Too $hort can't think of anything else to rhyme about, then he should ""stay away."" By the way, all of the artists featured on this album come with nothing...plus they're all wack anyway."
3,"Good effort, but falls way 'Too Short'","Too Short should have stayed in retirement. As you listen to this cd, you wonder who exactly you are listening to. Not enough funk for a true Too Short fan. If this is going to be your first Too Short album, I say skip it and buy ""Get In Where You Fit In"". That album is Short at his best. I give ""Can't Stay Away"" 3 stars out of respect for Short. Very weak album!"
1,flat,this disc is very flat.i saw it coming when Too Short got down with Jermaine Dupri.this album is nothing but a Commercial Project.it's a sad day when an Artist that has defied the Industry and done his own thing stoops to this Level.he has lost his edge&flow.
5,Too $hort gets in ware he fits in,"I'm from Oakland and I'v been waiting for this to come out. A friend of mine let me hear the album but would not tape it for me for legal reason's and I wanted to girp him for it. This album is on hit and when it comes out it's mine. It's clasic Too $hort to the ""T"" and like he said ""I got 3 platnum albums and you still call me weak just because I don't sale records in the east"" the east needs to get up on this. Biiiittttcccchhhh"
1,What happened to the February 23 release date.,"When I got Mystikals new album and saw the release date and album cover I thought it was going to be only a few months before it would come out. But it keeps getting pushed back. Now I have to wait til June 15! I don't want his album no more I going to get Krayzie Bone's new album ""Thug Mentallity""."
3,Too $hort fell off,"This album is about as good as ""Gettin' It,"" which doesn't come close to $hort at his peak. Listen to ""Cuss Words"" or ""In the Trunk"" from back in the day and *then* listen to this and tell me it's good. And who has to wait until June? I already have this album."
4,SHORT DOG JUST PIMPIN AS USUAL!,"I THINK THE ALBUM IS DEFINITELY TIGHT. THE MUSIC IS FUNKY AND BASS HEAVY AS USUAL, AND THE LYRICS FILLED WITH TRUE GAME IN SHORT DOG FASHION. I'M JUST REALLY UPSET THAT TOO SHORT TOOK 5 ORIGINAL SONGS OFF THE ALBULM AND REPLACE THEM WITH 1 REMIX AND 4 SONGS BY NEW UNRELEASED ARTISTS. I BOUGHT A TOO SHORT ALBULM, SO I WANT TO HEAR TOO SHORT ON EVERY TRACK. I CAN LISTEN TO NEW ARTISTS ON A COMPILATION ALBULM OR SOMETHING. NOW I'M WONDERING WILL I EVER HEAR THOSE MISSING CUTS FROM HIS ALBULM."
2,He'll stay away after this...,"What did we all wait 6 months for? This album is full of adds for other rappers, and very little of the independent, unique and serious Too $hort style that's been on his latest albums and duets. Don't expect the quality of cuts like the ones with Ant Banks, Jay-Z, or 'Pac. He hollers ""biiitch,"" but it's unconvincing and marketed just like this album with its CD-jacket full of advertisements. The stamp on the front of the CD ""featuring Puffy"" says it all. I thought Too Short was a rapper with integrity that wouldn't change himself Snoop Dogg style; but I was wrong. As far as I'm concerned, Gettin' It was Too Short's last album."
1,Not one single good song - DO NOT BUY THIS!,"Absolutely hated this. Not one good song, and an utter waste of time and money. Stick with the older Too Short cds (nothing past 1995)."
4,Good to hear he can still rap,"I like this cd because he doesn't change what he started. The only problem is that he keeps rappin what he did in 1983 which gets kind of old, which makes you wonder if he's still a pimp he would rap about what he did yesterday than what he did 20 years ago."
5,"a fiction so true to war, and true to Croatia","Grendel: Devils and Deaths is one of those great comic fictions (like Dark Knight and Watchmen) which reveal so much of the time and culture which produced them. The story takes place in an imagined distant future, but yet is so clearly about the hatreds and terror of the early 90s Balkan wars (its writer and artist are natives of Croatia).I think what I love so much about this work is the constant mix of strength and weakness in the characters-- there are no supermen here. The boldest warriors are gripped with fear, the most murderous generals are not portrayed without sympathy, and even the most oppressed are not innocent. This is real life.It is true to the Balkans, with its myriad factions, and also so true to Croatia-- the beautiful beaches Borna longs to see...This work is sadly out of print, but hopefully not for long. Highly recommended."
5,"Bought one issue of this comic for a quarter, and....","I got sucked in, and had to buy the whole thing collected, as should you. Awesome, cinematic story, with great characters and writing about family, tribal warlords, human nature, politics, love, monsters, violence, confronting death - all perfectly executed and told with economy, understanding and subtlety. The art somehow compliments and adds to the work in nearly every frame. And hey, the introduction to the book made my jaw drop, quite a story; the fact that the book exists is a miracle, obviously it was meant to happen. If you like comics and stories, you should buy this, it's very well done, and that's often rare."
4,Good product for good price,"Personally, the main reason why I bought this was to just delete corrupted data that couldn't normally be deleted, and by doing that I mean re-formatting the memory card. It worked though and everything's back to normal. =)"
4,Old and Funny,"I have not seen this in along time a good classic, one they don't show to often.Lee Marvin, and Jane Fonda, still put on a good performance even though it's almost like a spaghetti western."
5,Another Satisfied Customer,The movie was in perfect condition and it was delivered within 5 days from purchase. Great communication between the seller and myself. Buy with confidence when buying movies from this seller.
4,excellent comedy western,"Many very funny and memorable scenes in this silly, enjoyable western spoof. Pretty much appropriate for all ages."
5,Lee Marvin is great!,I wish that Lee Marvin had done more comedy. He has great timing and is a slapstick master. You've also got yo love Nat King Cole and the musical idea carried to the next level in Blazing Saddles
2,Great Except For Ms. Hanoi,"Lee Marvin is awesome in his role as Kid Sheleen... you have to see him! The story is humorous and a good satire on western flicks. The music (Stubby Kaye and Nat King Cole) is lively and quite enjoyable. A fun movie about the typical western theme -- a crook trying to take over someone else's land and property for his own nefarious reasons. Why then should this movie be rated at only 2? Without the Hanoi Princess (famous for her picture on the anti-aircraft gun pretending to shoot down American planes and American boys) playing the role as Cat, I'd give it a 5. Her presence is enough to lower any rating by at least 3 points."
4,Very Funny; Great Marvin,"I really only knew Lee Marvin as a tough un-emotional army officer in movies like 'Dirty Dozen' and the 'Big Red One'. Here he plays a very drunk cowboy helping out a young woman (Fonda) who lost her father because the people in the town are after his farm. His role her is very funny and also really good and he deservedly got the oscar for this performance.Jane Fonda is very young here and plays a surprisingly comical role as a well educated woman who prefers to read dime-novels instead of Tennyson. Everything she does she even gets out of these novels.The entire movie is funny, dialogue is great and they make fun of a lot of typical western stuff.A special mention has to be made of Nat King Cole who, with someone else, acts as a kind of narrator of the story, but more like a bard/troubador who sings the story. The movie came out after he died unfortunately."
5,A very funny offbeat western!,This original script became a cult movie from its instantaneous release. Lee Marvin received the Academy Award and also the coveted Silver Bear as Best Actor.It's a true treat!
3,Pleasant and well-intentioned,"An innocent schoolteacher (Jane Fonda) returns home only to witness her father's murder and the theft of his farm by an unscrupulous businessman. Seeking revenge, she assembles her own gang and cheerfully embarks on a life of crime. Lee Marvin, in a dual role as the drunken former gunslinger Kid Shelleen and the cold, noseless assassin Tim Strawn, is the best thing about this film. The rest of it is a pleasant enough way to spend an hour and a half but just doesn't have the laughs to make it a first-rate comedy."
2,Not As Funny As It Thinks It Is,"I'm sorry, but this movie misses the mark with me. Too much of this movie TRIES to be cute and funny and clever, and when the trying shows, it's a sure sign that it's not working.Some performances are spot-on. Almost all the bit parts are done beautifully. Tom Nardini as Jackson Two-Bears is outstanding and charming. But although Lee Marvin got an Oscar for his dual role as Kid Shelleen and Tim Strawn, I felt he was just too over-the-top to match the rest of the cast. Obviously the director didn't know how to rein him in...or chose not to.I don't praise the ""wandering minstrels"" Stubby Kaye and Nat King Cole; rather, I find them annoying, intrusive, jarring, and self-serving. As for the songs they sing, for the most part they're eminently forgettable."
1,Don't bother,"I enjoyed this in 1965, but 40 years later, it's painful to watch. Badly directed, the ""comedy"" is heavy handed and extremely forced, made worse by an inept supporting cast. Jane Fonda is adequate, but has zero chemistry with Michael Callan (who went on to have basically no career at all), thus depriving the film of a center, while Dwayne Hickman has nothing to do but stand around. Lee Marvin eats the scenery and the several laughs in the movie belong to him. But he tries too hard and is often as unfunny as he is funny. Despite his oscar, this is one of his worst performances. The song interludes wear thin very quickly, with the songs simply telling us what we've already seen. So even though it's not a long film, the songs make it seems much, much longer. The Jewish jokes are embarrassing, and the slapstick is poorly done. If you want a comedy western, you're better off watching ""Blazing Saddles"" for the 10th time than watching this turkey even once."
4,Wicked through and through,"This is a great little comedy, kind of a musical with lots of laughs, catchy songs, and some classic scenes. Lee Marvin is very deserving of his Oscar, as scene stealer Kid Shelleen. This drunken gun slinger manages to miss the broad side of a barn. Jane Fonda is great as the revenge seeking Cat Balou. ""The face of an angel, fights like the devil.""However, the real treat of this film is the pair of wandering minstrels. Stubby Kaye (Nicely Nicely in Guys and Dolls) strums around with Nat ""King"" Cole providing a lovely soundtrack. Their performance really makes this movie work, and moves it beyond a western parody."
5,Cat Baliou,We loved this movie - it is great to see more than one time and is a lighthearted fun movie.
5,cat ballou dvd,"I love this movie and haven't seen it for a long time, was very happy to find it I buy very few movies but this one had to be added to my small collection, it is so funny and I could watch it over and over"
4,Like gore??,"Great movie by a new independent film studio, good job by all those who acted in the movie. Very well put together with the budget that they had. The score was to die for. If you like surprises you should seriously get this movie.. It has a surprise ending I have never seen in any other movie.S.C"
5,The Argumentative Indian,"This is an important collection of essays by Dr.Amartya Sen for any reader interested in the full range of philosophic viewpoints in India""s cultural heritage. Often portrayed as a land of uncritical religiosity, Dr.Sen brings out India's long tradition of skepticism,doubt and critical reasoning including a considerable body of non-theistic literature. He argues that this rational argumentative tradition has been crucial in the development of India's secular polity and it's application will be essential in the ultimate success of her democratic framework and future social harmony. The book is beautifully written and each essay is a joy to read.A wide range of India's literary,philosophic,religious,scientific and mathematical contributions is comprehensively covered. It should be essential reading for anyone seriously interested in contemporary India and her heritage."
5,Excellent arguments!,"Brilliant discourse on a range of topics connected to India and Indians. More Indians should read this to appreciate how inclusive India has historically been, to understand how Tagore was much more than a poet, and to be amazed by the level of intercourse of ideas over two millenia between India and China. More westerners should read this to shatter their illusions, fed in great measure by the ""simplicist"" Samuel Huntington, about India being some sort of homogeneous ""Hindu"" civilization, and to appreciate that science, tolerance and democracy are not creations of the west. Sen is bound to make many enemies among his compatriots, though, with his implicit support for the ""Aryan Invasion Theory"" and his staunch secularism - but then as he points out himself - less than 25% of Indians over the last few general elections have voted for a certain political party."
1,What about Nazrul Islam?,"I am rather surprised and dismayed that Dr. Amartya Sen did not make a single reference to the contribution of Kazi Nazrul Islam a.k.a. The Rebel Poet--a Bengali Muslim who revolutionized the independence movement in West Bengal and Bangladesh in the 1930s. Nazrul Islam brought Hinduism and Islam together in British India and condemned Islamic fundamentalism. He is the father figure of Bengali Muslims and by far the ultimate ""Argumentative Indian""."
1,All I Wanted Was a Stop Watch,"I must have misread the description of this item. It works well as a regular stopwatch. However: it can't be turned off as far as I can tell, there is no way to replace the battery short of disassembling the whole unit, the instructions are printed in what looks like 4-pt. type and they are unclear (I think incorrect in one case), finding one's way to the correct mode for setting other features is a nightmare. It will work well for me as a stopwatch, but when the battery runs out, it will become a throwaway item."
1,Simple stop watch -- NOT NOT NOT,"OMG - This is the worst! We love Learning Resources products, but NOT this one!I wanted a simple stopwatch for my kids to use to time themselves at various things (schoolwork, outside time, reading time, etc) This is NOT the one. The directions included were printed in a font size of about 2. Microscopic to read. I'm a college graduate (6 year professional degree) and it was impossible for me to figure out how to set, re-set, or anything else that I had planned to use it for.We ended up going with the red Learning Resources one (which is perfect - STOP & START). The yellow one is outta here!"
2,Nice stopwatch with a dead battery,"The stopwatch is nice for kids. I bought it for my five year old son and he really likes it. Unfortunately it must be old stock as it ships with a dead battery. So if you plan on buying, plan on replacing the battery out of the box."
5,Softball glove,"I purchased this glove for my 16 year old daughter to use playing softball. When we received the glove, it stated it was a ""Youth glove-ages 6-8"", which was not mentioned in the description at the time of purchase. Although it fits my daughter's hand and is within the length requirement of her Coach, the review definitely needs to be more descriptive."
5,THIS FRICKIN' R-O-C-K-S!!,"I listened to every hair band in the 80's and Helix was one of the most underrated. Their party mentality made for some great music, and this CD captures it in a big way. If you love 80's metal, don't miss this one -you'll be sorry."
4,The Best of Helix: Deep Cuts - Finally!,"I searched the record stores for years trying to get a compilation CD for this Canadian band. Half-Alive gave me hope but was missing too many of the tracks I wanted. Fortunately, Deep Cuts delivered with almost every track I wanted (it was missing Does a Fool Ever Learn from No Rest for the Wicked album).Wild In the Streets is my favorite (it's just damn fun, especially if you saw their MTV video of it), followed by Deep Cuts the Knife, Heavy Metal Love, The Kids Are All Shakin' and Rock You. Some nice bonuses for me were Gimme Gimme Good Lovin' and Good to the Last Drop, which are both good tunes.Compare these underrated guys to Kix, Y&T, XYZ and Thunder. If you can only afford one album from Helix, this is the one."
3,Missing essential songs!!!,"This a good overview, but not as good as others are saying. It is missing (Make Me Do) Anything You Want. If you want the best greatest hits package, go with Over 60 Minutes With Helix."
5,urban cowboy soundtrack,"IVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS SOUNDTRACK TO PUT ON MY I POD SINCE I WATCHED THE FILM.JOHN TRAVOLTA SHOWS HIS DANCING SKILLS IN THE FILM WITH DEBRA WINGER,LOVELY MOVER AS USUAL EVEN ON THE RODEO COW CONTEST HE LOOKS LIKE HES DANCING."
4,urban cowboy soundtrack,Usually cd's only contain 2 or 3 really good songs but if you like good country music this track is very good and a great mix and is great music to turn up the volume and let it rip
4,urban cowdoy soundtack....... the best music,"I am thoughtly enjoying the Urban Cowboy soundtrack. I purchased two copies and I gave one copy to a friend who had never heard of it before for a Christmas present. He told me that he thought it was great and that it had a wide variety of music that would suit all taste. Urban Cowby Soundtrack, I highly recommend it."
3,A gift,As this CD was a present all I can say is the expression on my friends face when he saw it: Pure joy!
3,Where were the good songs?,"I love this movie, and I like the songs on this soundtrack, but, there are some songs that were in the movie that realy need to be on the soundtrack, but, they, for some reason left them out. Such as the intro song, ""Texas"", by Charley Danials. But, overall, it is a good album."
5,Great Service,Love the sound track of this movie. Takes me back to myyounger days!! Some really good memories! Thanks!
4,Grabbing!,"San Francisco - Earthqauke! was very moving in the beginning. When I first watched it, all of the fascinating footage really caught my attention. I think this movie would be especially helpful for educational purposes. The movie really teaches you a lot about the great San Francisco earthquake of 1989. I thought most of this movie was pretty good, especially the beginning."
4,Booze and violence,"This is one of the funniest comics around today (another being DORK, also by M&C creator Evan Dorkin). Why is it funny? Because Milk and Cheese get away with something we all wish we could get away with: getting liquored up and beating the crap out of annoying people. That's all this comic is, but then that's all it needs to be. Well, maybe that, and a dash of talk-show viewing, but even to do that, they have to rend, pummel, lacerate, and bludgeon anyone who gets in their way. This is pure mayhem, a 2-man riot.Hilarious dialogue only adds to the mayhem. It's apparent that M&C take their mission, to destroy all idiots, very seriously. The question is: how can Evan Dorkin take essentially the same storyline and make it entertaining over and over again? Believe me, he does it VERY well, and the little comments and asides add immeasurably to the fun. I would prefer to give this 9 of 10, so please forgive the 4.Now if only he'd start collecting DORK in trade editions. I need more!"
5,Dairy Products Gone Horribly Wrong,MILK & CHEESE : Alcoholic dairy products filled w/ hate and aggression bent on correcting the status quo and the insipid (are they the same? They think so). It's downright hilarious and completely leftfield. An absolute *MUST* for anyone who sees a riotous playground in seeing an animated carton of milk and a wedge of cheese (my heroes) wreak havoc on everything and everyone.This is the trade paperback that collects the first 4 volumes. Collect them all!
5,Gets better and better!,"These songs are a little more ""grown up"" than some of the Wiggles' previous simple songs but they are still catchy, appealing and fun for all three of my kids. My 1,6, 8 year old and myself love this CD more and more as we listen to it. ""The Captain's Wavy Walk"" and ""Hula Hula Hula"" are our favorites. Definitely worth the money if you are a Wiggles fan."
4,Who doesn't like puppets?,"If you've got even a hint of imagination, you've gotta love puppets. And these puppets are no exception. Human puppets with even the slightest attention to detail are hard to come by. These are neat because you get a good blend of different characters to play with. The only downside is that they're not the easiest to manipulate...is it just my hands? I can't really find a way to move both of the arms and still have control of the head. Maybe I'm expecting too much from these puppets. At any rate, they're still going to be lots of fun as my daughter and I put on a puppet show. Pretending and imagination are developed by toys like these."
5,I would recommend this product!,I was surprised how fast I received this product! It was properly sealed and perfect! I was not sure if my grocer carried it but I did not have to worry about that!
3,Very fast shipping,"Absolutely nothing wrong with the spice, came very fast and was great quality. I just have never used Cardamon before and needed it to try a new recipe but found out I don't like the flavor of the spice."
2,Good while they lasted.,"These finally gave way today, after less than a year. Lower handle cover fell off. Also, blades are loose and can't be tightened. Can no longer make it through 1/4"" green without twisting like safety scissors on cardboard. The bolt is tight but the upper blade wobbles. There's $20 down the drain. For twice the price right now, you can buy Felco pruners which is what I'm going to do right now. 2 stars as they worked nice before they gave out. I would probably risk another pair for $7-$8, but not at this price.EDIT (6/4/10): Kudos to Fiskars for coming through on their warranty. I sent them a picture of the broken pruner and they are sending me a new one. Of course, I've already made the switch to Felco, but a backup will be nice."
2,one season only,"I was looking for a sharp garden clippers that will stay sharp, I have dozens that I purchased over the years and are worthless after awhile.Then I saw this and the description said 5x sharper & last longer. I bought 2 immediately and guess what?They both last 1 season only!! The 2nd year, the sharpness is gone, you have to try several times just to clip a very thin flower stem! Very disappointing.I wish someone would have reviewed after using it 1 year, not just when its newwhich was fantastic, I would not have bought it if I knew, because for lasting 1 year, you can buy the same for 80% cheaper then throw them away!"
1,Not so hot,"I was looking for a professional quality tool, this isn't it. the blade warped and cut into the anvil on the third cut I made. Bad gouge in the anvil means it won't cut clean any more."
2,Hard to use after 1 year,I bought these Pruners and after 1 year of use they don't cut clean through thin or slightly thick branches anymore. The make noise when closing and opening them and the rubber handle cover comes off sometimes. I will need to look for ones that last longer and cut through branches cleanly longer.
2,A so-so pruner,"Jams closed frequently as described by another reviewer.After several years of moderate use the slide button became ineffective and unadjustable. It drove me nuts latching open or closed depending on the angle the pruner was at. Finally I replaced the slide button with a ""Nylock"" nut and bolt. Latches ok now.It fits comfortably in my hand."
2,let's be honest,"I so wanted this movie to be great. Or even good. But it's neither. In fact, it borders on being down right bad. Stiff acting, tired premise, laughable special effects. I give it two and a half stars, though, because it did magage to hold my interest."
3,not so great gator,"this vhs was blurry. needs more gator action & with enough length. i was kind of a long and white lookin gator. if u can find it, widescreen would be better."
5,Love Removable Cover,This product was definitely worth the money. I really wanted something with a removable cover so I could wash it; especially since it goes on my face. The lavender smell has remained strong. And extra bonus--my 13 year old cat also seems to love the smell.
4,fast and relevant,"engaging characters drive this quick-moving story. great for a relaxing weekend. in addition to looming questions of the dangers of a video game generation, much is given to debating the values of religion in history and society. pick it up."
3,Old Cookbook,"The Betty Crocker""s Picture Cook Book is a classic amoung cookbooks. I bought it as condition ""good"" and it was quite shabby. Some recipes are missing or smudged so badly they cannot be read. It should have been rated as ""poor."""
2,Outdated,"The book has some good information for when it was written, but It was published in 2006 and much has changed since then. I also felt that for a do it yourself book that it used some technical terms that a do it yourselfer like myself had to go look up to see what he was talking about. I feel it is not up to date with the equipment available today nor the new systems in automobiles that a carputer would have to integrate with, such as steering wheel controls. It is pretty much useless for today."
3,"Good Ideas, but outdated.","Just finished reading this book. First, the book itself is very well written and easy to understand, but not as ""instructional"" as I would have hoped.I believe this book was written a few years ago and even in that short of time frame, almost everything that is covered is already cheaper and outdated. Almost everything he covers is at the oldest technology end of what can be purchased today. For example he highly recommends Windows XP as the best operating system to have (We all have Windows 7, and 8 will be out shortly).The actual how-to part of this book basically is a review of each item he has. Not really how to use it or the best way to run them. And any instruction he does give can easily be learned with a quick google search. I'm not downplaying the book or the author. With technology like this, anything written a few years ago will be very outdated today.Overall, he presents a few good ideas that you might not have thought of. But other than that, not much else."
1,"WARNING; NOT BASSIST MARCUS MILLER. THIS ""MARKUS"" MILLER SERVES UP AN INFERIOR PRODUCT NOT FOR PUBLIC CONSUPMTION.","Really poor sonic quality. Sounds as if recorded in a cement pipe, and it goes downhill from there. Ultra cheesy drum machine and dreadfully cheap sounding keyboard ""arrangements"" provide lackluster backing for, at best, mediocre guitar ramblings of questionable intonation. The only live instruments, were obviously recorded direct, and in this case the tone is less than remarkable.Clearly recorded in ""do it yourself"" style this is not a professional sounding effort. The whole thing lacks any kind of focus whatsoever and should have been strictly for Mr. Miller and his friends (see reviews 1-4). Access to a PC with recording software do not a recording artist make."
5,Another Hit!,"Markus has music for everyone! Again I'm amazed at what he is able to do. Audubon Park is my new favorite. Once you listen, it will be your favorite as well!"
5,Solid lopper,Very easy to use with it's Power Lever. I cut 2 inch branch with little effort. Very sharp blade! This one is a keeper!!!
2,I should've bought the other one,At first glance the lopper looked like a great tool. It is constantly coming apart where the floating axis hooks in the sliding slot. I'd recommend getting the other lopper for heavier work.
4,Nice contemporary horror,"This is the book based on the John McTiernan's film (not the opposite), and I found it much more interesting that other Yarbro's books (as the overpaged Hyacinths). If you like contemporary fantasy/horror as Lucius Shephard's ""Green Eyes"" or DeLint's ""Little Country"", you may like this."
5,"Relief, finally.","Ever since I moved to Arizona, I have been plagued with horribly dry & itchy skin, and even more so now that winter is coming. This lotion is the first I have found that actually helps. It really does last 24 hours, and the cooling menthol is great. This stuff works!!"
2,"Seems Great, Wish I Could Use It","I have every confidence that this product would perform well, as it is sturdy and well made. Nice that it can go from an all-purpose holder to a round-specific holder with the flick of a plastic piece.The problem is it will not clip to my air vent. It is designed for air vents with directional slots under a certain depth, and my car's vents are slightly too deep, so the clips will not reach in far enough to hold.So be warned that this is not universal. I drive a 1992 VW Passat, so if you drive an early 90's VW or Audi, you might want to avoid this one."
1,Poorly designed & not universal at all,I own three late model vehicles & with tremendous effrot was only able to install in one vehicle. The installation in that vehicle proved to be incapable of withstanding the slightest bump without falling from its location. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
1,vent drink holders,"I am not happy with what this cost, how cheap it is, how little it holds, or how it might affect the vent it is put on. Very sad. I can't even sell it. Don't buy one, you'll be disappointed like we were."
2,Started out a good!,"thought I finally found the perfect cup holder..I actually bought some of these as gifts for my friends. I have a couple in my car..put wet wipes in them, my cell phone as well as my drink. Nothing heavy. After a month or so....the bottom slidder, that holds it in place, kept slipping and now won't hold any more..It would cost me too much to return them so I'm trying to rig them to make them work..What I thought was a good thing...turned out.....not so good!!!Not worth the money!"
5,"Simple design, but works well.","I got really tired of not having anything to put my drinks in, so I thought I'd take a shot and get two of these (one for the passenger side). It was a little tricky to get them in the vents, but after I figured out that all I had to do hold the cup holder by the front and gently push the hooks in until they grabbed, it worked fine. I like that the front and side has a metal bar that helps keep drinks cold or hot (this feature really works by the way, very nice!). I haven't had any spillage or accidents but I would have liked the bar to be a bit higher set on the drink. I'll state again though that I've used this for about a week and haven't had any drinks fall over, so I guess whoever designed it knew what they were doing.If you have vents that are narrow horizontally this may not fit. I found this would only fit on the vents nearest to the car doors, but don't see it as a drawback."
3,"Flimsy, but they work okay","I bought two of them for the truck and they seem to work okay. Be careful though, they aren't made too strong."
4,How to Play Chess Endings,"This is a classic endgame text. Znosko-Borovsky is a smooth, lucid writer. All the basic endgames are given. He concentrates on logical thinking in the endgame, analysing a position, and developing a plan of action. The emphasis is on aims, plans, and ideas, rather than on reams of varitions. If you want that kind of book, pick up Fine's Basic Chess Endings or the series by Averbach. But these books are dull, tedious and for masters and above. Even experts would get a lot out of this book. The value is excellent as well. The best way to improve is to concentrate your study on endings (most people play them quite badly) and tactics. Forget those opening books. (CFC Expert)"
5,By Far the most practical book on the endgame,"If you really want to increase your endgame strength then use this book. The examples are clear, concise and easy to understand without being boring (Unlike the Averbach Essential chess endgame book). Also the book is a great value.Although a bit dated and using Descriptive notion the examples come from pre 1950 and include, Alekhine, Capablanca, Rubenstein, Euwe Botvinnik, Keres etc all greats of the endgame. I have found this to be the easiest book from which to assimilate the required practical knowledge. It was way ahead of its time and includes the theory of corresponding squares which is often only included in advanced texts. Once this book is finished your endgame practical skill will be at the master level. I would also recommend that you also use the Hooper Pocket book of Endgames for additional examples for study."
4,almost perfect...,This is a great book...really helpful...The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the chaper on Rook endings is occasionaly not clear enough (It is apparently targeted towards a more sophisticated reader - I am a beginner-intermediate player) This chapter could use some improvement. Still I am extremely happy with this purchase.
3,Other Books,"A useful guide, for when I was interested. If you are going to a club or other place for a game, a convenient small size to brush up on things if you want a refreshers.Goes over all the major and not so major necessary situations and strengths to understand."
5,"Romantic, lyrical, synphonic; a great find","""The Romance of Paris"" - What a great find. Every song exudes romance, intimacy and a whirlwind of illusion. The music is lyrical and at moments synphonic. It is weightlessand touches the listener tenderly. David Wilson and his muscians bring merit to ""easy listenng""."
3,Warning for Kindle shoppers,"Before you consider purchasing the Kindle version of this title, check the preview. It appears to me to be nothing more than a typewritten copy of the title essay. It is not the Penguin edition at all. It does not, for example, include the satire, Meditation on a Broomstick, for example. Caveat emptor."
4,Interesting comedy,Great satire on the horrible conditions of Ireland at the time. Very creative and elaborate imagery as well. Would recommend.
5,A modestly profound statement,"A tip of the hat to my sophomore English teacher for introducing this work to me so many years ago, showing me the power of well honed sarcasm."
2,for die-hard brass fans only,"Brass instruments always highlighted the shortcomings of the CD format. That's perhaps why Sony brought out this disk, to show that SACD can portray the sound of trumpets, etc., as well or better than LP. They've succeeded. This sounds at least as good as brass on LP. What's the problem with this disk then? Brass, brass, brass. When was the last time you went to your local symphony hall and heard an all-brass concert? You just won't need to listen to an hour of this. If you want to show off your SACD player to friends, pick one of Murray Perahia's piano or piano-and-orchestra albums. Or either of the superb Hyperion SACDs (trios or Busoni piano concerto)."
4,Organizations and people who predicted the collapse of the USSR,"Quote:In 1968 Egon Neuberger predicted that ""[t]he centrally planned economy eventually would meet its demise, because of its demonstrably growing ineffectiveness as a system for managing a modernizing economy in a rapidly changing world.""2020. Egon Neuberger, ""The Legacies of Central Planning,"" RM 5530-PR, Rand, June 1968, quoted in Gertrude E.

1,Look further,"We have not been very happy with this hot water heater. Although it was installed by a plumber- it does not operate well at all. Showers are awful. We often get just cold water for a really extended period of time or have to turn the water off & on several times for it to kick in. We have had to turn the thermostat up really high to get any heat at all. These problems have existed from day one and there are only 2 of us in the house. No help from the manufacturer either. We have troubleshot everything that is supposed to fix this known problem, but nothing has worked. I wish we would have gone w/ a bigger unit or a different manufacturer. We will never buy another tankless from Bosch- we are out over $1,000.00 between cost and installation and really need to replace it as it is never going to work right. A huge disappointment."
1,Run very fast from this piece of junk,I would only recommend this unit if you like cold showers and terrible customer service. If I had the CEO of Bosch's home address I would drop ship him this worthless piece of crap. First and last time buying a Bosch appliance.
1,Tearing it Out,"The unit was properly installed and worked the first time I turned it on. After limited use (a few hours, it's in a cabin) over several months, it failed. Our gas man was able to bet it started by cleaning the sparking unit. It worked alright (at best) for another several hours over a few months, and now will not light.The sparking unit is cleaned, the filter has been cleaned, and the hydroelectric unit has been taken apart and cleaned, and checked for output---it's fine. I'm faced now with taking potluck on getting another control unit ($150 plus ship, plus installation) or just getting rid of this Bosch lemon. (We love our Bosch dishwasher.)Maybe these units don't work well after they sit for awhile. Then again, they don't appear to work well in any case. I definitely advise against buying.I"
1,dont waste your money,Going one 3 years now and yet again another part has broken!I have had to replace the hydro generator the pilot gas limiter and the main limiter. This has been a waste of money. I have now spent more on this water heater than a more expensive reliable unit.I am going to get rid of this pos POS and get a better one.Do not but this water heater unless you got losts of money and don't mind cold showers.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT!,"Wow... am I ever sorry I purchased this ""pilot-less"" Bosch unit! How about getting hot water 50% of the time! What I would have saved in gas I spent in wasted water.Bosch support - sucks, they say you need to acquire equipment in order to do some testing before they will do anything about it (Voltmeter and a Manometer). Oh, the other option is to hire a plumber to trouble shoot with them.I could see this may be necessary for most customers but I have had a the Bosch AQ125B running for 5 years... flawlessly! (in another part of the house). Common sense dictates the GWH1600H is defective.. so replace it!"
3,Cautiously Optimistic,"My plumber installed this one, a replacement for a similar Bosch model 4 years old, same model with significantly higher price tag. Since repairs are nearly impossible, replacement is required. I still have significant savings on my gas bill. Hopefully, this one will last longer. If not, the next tankless will not be a Bosch."
1,bosch tankless water heater,"had a problem with the gas valve on new heater, when Bosch found out i bought it from Amazon.com they said they would not honor warranty. I needed hot water so i had them send a new gas valve which i paid for ( $ 260.00 ) they sent wrong part. As of a week and a half latter i still do not have hot water. Would never buy a Bosch appliance or tool again. This company has been inpossible to deal with. 19 phone calls and no hot water and they could care less."
1,Completely unacceptable,"With the first Bosch AquaStar tankless heater my plumber installed, the pilot came on easily enough when the hot water flowed, but the burners failed to ignite. After 90 minutes of following the trouble-shooting points in the owner's manual, the plumber suggested I get a new Bosch from Lowe's or go without hot water.Two hours later, the exact same malfunction occurred with the second Bosch. After one hour on the phone with the Bosch techs (who merely had the plumber go over all the same trouble-shooting points again), the technical people suggested replacement, not knowing of course, that this had already been done.I then ordered a Rheem tankless heater and went without hot water for two days. The Rheem arrived, was installed, worked from the very first try, and there has not been one problem with it. My plumber has declared that he will NEVER install another Bosch tankless water heater for any of his customers.Bosch obviously has some serious design and quality flaws."
5,Great Book,"I would highly recommend this book for anyone who studies end time prophecy. Especially if you are of the Dispensational mindset. This book lays out and documents how people have always found ""signs of the end times"" in world event for centuries and how those signs always seem to change with the culture and worldview of the time. After reading this book, you will begin to see how people have been misinterpreting Bible prophecy for a long time."
3,Not As Pictured and it Leaks,"What I wanted is what is shown in the picture.THERMOS CO. 7221 - Hot & Cold Food JarThe item in this sale has a solid handle, should have read the description better. This will not fit in a pack well or lunch box. It's much easier to shop and get exactly what you want when they use the actually picture of the item and not something similar. Does keep the food warm and holds a good amount. *After using this twice it leaked (at school). In all fairness it was on it's side but it still should not have leaked, thank goodness it only had water in it this time.I would give this only 2 stars but I can't change my rating after posting my initial review, I can only edit the review."
2,Good for Kids - But Otherwise Get a Metal One,"This Thermos Food Jar is will keep food hot for a few hours or so. It's good for kids' lunches maybe, but not for someone who works long days or spends alot of time outdoors or in cold weather. Take the money you'd invest in this, add a few more dollars and get a wide-mouthed metal U.S.-Made Thermos Food Jar on eBay and you'll be alot happier."
2,Not Microwave Safe,"The glass insulation on the thermos ""busted"" during micowave use. The description of the item does not address whether or not it is microwave safe -- I should have researched better before purchasing."
1,Don't waste your money,"It looks great in the box; but, when you get it wet all the fun stops there. My sub worked for about thirty seconds. Now it only works when it wants to..short somewhere? A nice $40 paper weight. What a rip off."
1,What's worse -- this bad toy or the indifferent company?,"Same problems as the other customers here in the one-stars.Within minutes of exploring the mysteries of my pool, the sub died.Could not get the company on the phone and they ignored my emails.The autopsy revealed that water had breached the port nacelle and the engine flooded.I will never again purchase anything from Swimline/ILP.The toy was crap and their customer service crappier."
1,A water toy that is not water tight. Lasted 1 week.,"I bought this sub for my 10 year old grandson to play with in the pool. After a few days we noticed the whole darn thing was full of water and the electronics wouldn't work any more. We gave it some time to dry out, and found it still wouldn't work. I tried to do a return, but was told I missed it by one day. Basically, I just took 31 dollars and flushed it down the drain. I thought Amazon stood by their products to a greater extent. I will think twice before I buy electronic products from Amazon again."
1,Toy didn't work,Although this toy has great reviews I seem to have got a faulty one. Firstly it didn't dive then after 30 minutes in the pool it stopped responding to the RC (replaced batteries) and would only go in circles on the surface. Looks like a quality toy but it is not.
1,*****Electronic Disaster *****,"Bought this toy for my son for Christmas. When it got warm enough to use in the pool, It worked for about 5 minutes, then the transmitter stopped working to control the sub. I found that if you place the antennae of the controller right next to the sub it would respond. I changed the batteries to ensure it had new batteries again and the same result. What a piece of junk !! I thought this was a quality product being that is was in the high forty dollar range. I will be contacting amazon t try to get this resolved, based on the other reviews, I see that ours is in line with alot of others. Waste of money in my opionion. My son is very sad an disappointed too, he is really into things like this at 6yrs old. He even thinks he had something to do with it not working and he didn't. Will keep you all updated."
4,my son loves it,This is the first water use R/C toy that has lasted more than a week. My son thinks it's cool.
4,My Son loves it!,"My son loves this submarine! If the sub goes too deep, it doesn't react to the remote controller anymore. You should not stand IN a pool while you play with it.I have a recommendation for you if you decide to purchase it - attach the controller to a lanyard or to a cord that will go around your child's neck so that if/when he drops it, it won't fall into the pool like ours did! I took some extra long ribbon and tied it to each side of the remote. If he drops it now, it will just hang there.After each use, you need to open up the battery compartment and let anything wet dry out. We never take good care of our toys, and we are making a big effort to with this toy. All the kids line up for a turn with this toy! I'm purchasing another one for my nephew's Christmas present."
2,Worked One Day,"Nice idea, just doesn't last even when played with by careful adult hands. This was a replacement sub for one that died in the tub. Same issues, sub will only work if placed right next to the remote. When first taken out of the box the range is really good. After using it for say an hour, the range drops to nothing and the sub becomes virtually useless. It is highly probable that water gets into the electronics shorting them out. The only problem is that I can't find any water intrusion. Its a shame because otherwise it seems to be a decent toy. But if its not going to work except for one day, its not really worth it. My advice is to wait for the next revision to see if that works better."
2,Unit pricing screwed up,"Why is every other battery unit priced per battery and these are priced per oz? FYI, it appears these cost out to about 39 cents per battery. I have not used the batteries."
5,About time!,"Most of Vixen's great albums are long out of print! I spent way too much time going from used CD store to store looking for their cataloge. Now you can get all the big hits on one CD. Vixen has always been one of my favorite female hard rock bands. They keep getting better with each album. Check out the last studio CD ""Tangerine""."
5,Great portable guide,I bought this to help plan an upcoming trip to San Francisco. I think it will be the only guide I get. I can look up other info online if I need to but this will be very handy to carry with me while I'm in the city.
2,did not recieve the pictured ruler,"I know the item title says assorted colors, but I was hoping it would still be transparent at the very least. The rulers in the picture are the transparent, flat, flexible kind, whereas the one i just got is raised with a groove down the middle and not meant to be flexible. In fact, the plastic seems very hard, shiny, and cheap. Granted, the ruler was only 60 cents total, but I would have liked to receive what I thought I was buying."
1,poor quality,"The markings don't extend to the edge of the ruler, which means you can't measure anything accurately without guessing where the lines extend to. what a waste!"
4,"Montana, Its Glories, Its People","Wolf/No Wolf is on the sad juxtoposition of those who have lived on the land and loved it, trying to eke out a living, and those who would like to return the Earth to its natural wonder. Interesting to point out that some environmentalists might be a tiny bit control-oriented, and that those against them may have agendas other than just protecting a way of life. Notches takes up serial killers, who prey on young people who may have been bounced from home or run from an abusive situation and are not just spoiled brats. Du Pre's solution to problems recalls Tony Hillerman's Jim Chee and Ellis Peters's Cadfael in which justice prevails, perhaps ignoring externally-applied laws. Additional is telling of a way of life of the Metis, of whom I never learned in school."
5,Michelle's winning attitude - young and fresh,"It is a bit annoying that amazon places it for age 9 - 12 and that reviewers say it's good for their children. (not good for themselves?) Though the book is full of 'childish' languages, the winning attitude here is full of youth and refreshing, unlike those written by professional psychiatrists - I'm not saying they are not good. I recommend this book to all who love Michelle."
2,"Looks pretty, but baby hates it","I love the look of the cosleeper. It is beautiful and I've gotten many compliments on it. Unfortunately, my baby won't sleep in it. The mattress is very uncomfortable and not soft and the sheet is scratchy. It also doesn't incline at all, which bothers my baby with reflux. I think a bassinet that rocks and inclines would be a better option. I'm hoping she'll like this when she gets older and at least it turns into a bench later."
2,Do NOT buy these sheet sets!!!,"These are one of the worst sheets I have ever owned. Your typical K-Mart Wal-Mart variety is better!1) they wrinkle like crazy!!!!!2) none of the sheets match in color: fitted sheet, flat sheet, pillow cases are dyed differently in different batches, they are in different tones3) flat sheet is soooooooooooooo small, not long enough to tuck under the mattress if you wanted to4) fitted sheet can barely go around my 15"" deep mattressOnly positive thing about them is that they are somewhat soft.Please don't bother with them, unless you don't care how your bed look, you won't like these!"
2,Bad Deal!,"I recently bought this set during a promotion. It was a fantastic deal - now I know why. After the first washing, the sheets were nice and soft. But, upon the second washing, the sheets started to pill and the seams started to come undone. I have never had anything degenerate in quality so quickly! My cheapy cotton blend sheets from Target that I bought 3 years ago have held up better than this set!"
2,Twin Sets (2 each White and Sage purchased),"We bought these sheet sets for our children's twin beds. For that purpose, I highly recommend these at the price we paid ($9.99/set). Sheets made in India.PROS:1. Softer than comparable (non-sateen) twin sheets available at Target, Wal-Mart, etc. for children's beds.2. Inexpensive option to have your children sleep on soft sateen, although these are not the super-soft sateen we have on our bed.2. Price ($9.99)CONS:1. The sets do not match in color (shades are off within the set to varying degrees), so if you're trying to impress folks on your adult bed, these are not a contender.2. These are obviously seconds, e.g., the seams don't run straight on the pillow cases. Just like the discount t-shirts you get with the side seams that curve to the front or back. Fine for young kids, because they don't care about such details."
1,BUYER BEWARE - These sheets stink!,"If the rating system had 0 stars, that would be the rating i would give these sheets, they are so horrible, so cheaply made, and very bad.I thought they were a great deal, and like any other new item, i wash all items before using them.After the 1st washing, the colors became mismatched. I used cold water...They also don't really fit my 17"" thick mattress...another person reported they don't fit her 15"" mattress.After the 2nd washing in warm water, the seams started to unravel, and oohh boy do they wrinkle and also the seams rolled so bad, the sheet wouldn't lay flat.By the 3rd washing, the color disparity grew even worse...they didn't even look green.My advice to you is don't buy these unless you need a furniture & floor covering for painting..that's what i use them for, the only thing they are good for."
2,Inexpensive for a reason,"These sheets were soft and comfortable when they first arrived. After one wash in the gentle cycle and low heat dry, they pilled badly. The colors also became slightly mismatched. After two washes the pillowcases were so pilled I couldn't stand to sleep on them any more. Even though they were very inexpensive, I got so little use out of them it still wasn't worth it."
4,For the price there are great sheets!,I bought these sheets on sale for $14.95. I needed an extra set and thought for this price I can't go wrong dispite some of the bad reviews these sheets got. There were some people that said they are too short and they are short lengthwise. For me it's not a huge deal. They drape over the end of my matress but not enough to tuck under. The sides have pleany of sheet to tuck. These sheets are very soft and they are not thin. They are 100% cotton so they will wrinkle. Just as soon as they come out of the dryer I fold them and put them away. They have not pilled on me and the wrinkling isn't that bad. I have another set I paid more for and wrinkle a lot more! The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is because they are short lengthwise.
2,soft..but don't wash!,"After the first wash, before even putting them on the bed, the fitted sheet had two holes where the threading didn't hold in the middle of the sheet. I was so disappointed! Can't imagine what will happen the next time I wash them. Other than that, the fabric is so soft to sleep on."
4,WOW - Way better than I expected,"I bought these for our kids bedrooms thinking that for the price they would do in a pinch. They are much nicer than the ones I bought a large department store at 3 times the price. They are incredibly soft and look quite good. For the price, I am not sure you could get a better value."
3,Nice sheets for a good price but...,"I purchased one set of the white and another set of ivory sheets with bonus pillowcases. These sheets are soft and comfortable. They seem to be well constructed and are not too soft or too heavy. For the money, I think they're a very good deal. However, I must echo the comments of the previous author by telling you that these sheets wrinkle like crazy. They wrinkle far more than any other sheets that I have used. Ever.Another very minor point is that the bonus pillowcases in ivory are not *exactly* the same shade that the other sheets and pillowcases are. They're close, no question, and the difference is probably not enough to bother you, but I can see a difference nonetheless.So in closing, I do indeed recommend these sheets at their current low price. However, it's important to be aware of the wrinkling issues related to these sheets."
2,soft but not smooth,"These sheets lost their smooth, satiny surface after only a few gentle washes in warm water. They started to pill, and developed the look and feel of aging flannel. I would not buy them again."
4,"Nice, soft set of sheets but not true to color","I ordered the sage and I was surprised to receive a much darker color than shown on this site. They are nice soft sheets for children, but I think I would have been happier ordering my daughter a set of flannel sheets. They do not seem to be very well-made, but I only paid $10 and got free shipping (since I ordered more stuff) so at the price of $10 there is nothing to complain about. The list price shown is what the manufacturer dreams of getting, but not what they are worth by any means. A nice set of flannel sheets for double the price would have made me happier."
5,Great weight and washable!,"I love this curtain for three reasons1. Its a heavy, durable weight2. Metal covered holes prevent it from ever tearing on the rings3. Its washable. I just throw it on the gentle cycle with a bit of bleach and detergent. Then into the dryer on a low heat setting for about 15-20 minutes.Much better than buying the cheap curtains over and over. Invest a bit, you will be much happier."
2,Too heavy,"It's really heavy - probably about 1 lb. Otherwise, I guess it's fine.. It's just a shower curtain liner after all."
1,disappointed with liner,Shower curtain liner was too heavy and had very strong chemical odor.This Croscill product seemed appropriate for some industrial use. We sent it back and had to pay return shipping fee ..
3,Great Product ! Large size great option,"Kids loved the product, I have twins and what is great about this product is because they are large in size they can ""hord"" all the alphabets and they both can play without the fights. I am glad I went for the larger size. the only down side is a couple of letters need more magnets, They stick to the frig but slip down."
3,Large Numbers?,"Still smaller than I thought they would be. The magnets are not strong enough to stay put on a textured steel refrigerator. Still, not a bad product for the price."
2,Good price. Magnets could be stronger.,"Not bad for the price. The kid likes them but the magnets are on the weaker side. When he wants to just slid them on the fridge, they will fall off. I would rather him have to pull them off with his fingers. When he tries to put them back on they tend to fall if he doesn't precisely place them flat. Only gave the item 2 starts due to this."
2,Weak Magnets,"I bought these to be used on a magnetic whiteboard. I was able to get 1-2 of each number to stick, and then threw the others away. The students did like watching them slide down the whiteboard while I wasn't watching though!"
2,poor magnets,"The magnets are not big enough or strong enough for the size of the numeral. Slightly dissappointed. I bought some letters from another company that were awesome, the magnets covered the entire back of each letter and they were perfect....might be Lakeshore Learning but I am not sure."
5,clean and neat,"This white fabric liner is exactly as described. Looks cleaner, neater than a vinyl one. It can be machine washed, to make it long lasting. The only thing that would make it better is if there were magnets on the bottom."
3,Croscill Fabric Shower Liner,"Although I like the look and feel of this curtain, they could do a better job of making it water proof. If your shower is flowing toward the curtain directly, you will end up with a floor filled with water."
4,"Great liner, we got white, so be prepared to clean it","Its a great liner, but we knew going in getting white means it will get dirty more. But its easily cleaned by just throwing it into the washing machine with the whites. I like the fabric liners much more than the plastic ones since they are just too hard and cheap looking, like Im showing in a garbage bag."
4,Made in China,"I was searching for an American made fabric shower curtain, and this one came up in the ""made in the usa"" shearch. I thought it was made here. I know you really have to be dilligent. I do like the look and performance of this product, but feel like there should be better designation for where things come from. I'm trying to use as many ""made here"" products as I can."
4,Good Value,"Got my shower curtains fast, they were as advertised.Good value for the price!Definately would order this item from this company again if I needed another."
5,THE VERY BEST,"I have four of these and love them. I do not use two curtains -- just this one). I actually ironed the pleats in so it hangs like a drape and when not using can be pushed back against the wall on the ouside of the tub -- very attractive. I've gotten so many comments on it. The ironed pleats have remained after many washings (cold water, bleach, hang to dry). The package said not to bleach but I use bleach every time I wash it (every few weeks). You will not be disappointed."
1,Rusts at top/ DEFECTIVE,"This looked so beautiful when I put it up, I was so excited, but the holes at the top started rusting within a week, which of course ran down onto the white shower curtain. My mother bought an identical one at Wal-Mart, which she had no rust problems with. I looked up close and hers seemed to be ""closed in"" around the holes & mine was exposed on the back side, which allowed the water in to create the rust. I suspect this is a defective group, as both curtains I purchased here did this."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I bought three of these shower curtains and only recently took one out of the package to use. Some of the eyelets came out while I was putting it up, and I had to sew a strip on the top so that I could put in button holes to replace the eyelets. What can you expect from a product made in China? Once up, it does repel water, but I have only used it a couple of times since installing it."
1,Inaccurate Dimensions,"The package states that the length is 72"". It is not. It is 74"" long and I can't use that in my tub. Had to return it."
1,TERRIBLE!,"I should have followed my hunch with the description saying ""water resistant."" It's fairly attractive and I was pleased at first, but soon some water started appearing on the floor. I'd bought two, so I put up the 2nd one and the two together worked. Then I washed them--they do get moldy. After the 3rd wash all the water resistance was gone and I had water coming through the kitchen ceiling!! Makes a decent shower curtain (although as some said the creases don't go away), but as a liner it SUCKS!!! Off-gassing or not, I'm sticking with vinyl. Before installing a new vinyl liner, hang it outside for a day and it will be mostly odor-free."
5,Love It!,I am thrilled with this liner. It is pretty enough to use alone but I have a beautiful curtain I ordered on Amazon that I have this one hanging behind. It is great! It is much nicer and neater than a plastic one! It is just perfect!
3,Fabric shower curtain,"The curtain works well. I liked the metal gromments for hooking the curtain to the shower rod. I also like being able to toss it in the washer when it needs to be cleaned. If you are using a plastic liner, throw it away and get a fabric one."
5,THIS ROCKS THE HOUSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I hate regular shower curtain liners. I buy the most expensive one I can find hoping it is thick and maybe has some anti-mildew coating on it. I stayed in a hotel that had these liners in their shower and I came home to find one of these on amazon!! So as fast as I could order it and make the UPS man come deliver my daily AMAZON package, I had it hanging in my bathroom. Its thick and definitely polyester. Which is good! I can take it down once a month and run it with bleach through the wash and its looks brand spanking new again in my shower. I love it!!! We have hard water and thus I like being able to just wash it clean. Recommend highly. No rusting on the grommets. I have been using it four months already."
3,Nice looking shower curtain liner but...,"I love the way this liner looks but I'm not too happy with the fact that it is NOT mold and mildew resistant. I cannot say much about how it holds up to machine washing, but for now it is water resistant."
4,hangin in there,"i like the shower curtain. i was looking for cloth instead of plastic. it keeps water in the tub unless sprayed directly with water. i wish it came in different colors or designs though. so far no mold growth, been over a month in use."
1,Mildewed within DAYS,"Ew! This curtain is nasty!!! It mildewed within DAYS of using and turned an entire corner black! It never dried, which is why I think this happened. I usually only replace my curtains once a year, but this one I had to return with a month.So gross!!!"
2,too much water gets out of the shower,it looks good and appears to be good quality upon arrival. but there is too much water on the floor after a shower and once the rust and the mildew set in it's difficult to keep at bay. not purchasing this again.
1,not as promised,sorry folks..water on the floor and lots of mold and mildew after 2 weeks. I now own these 1.5 months and havewashed them once a week just to keep the mold at bay. I Will continue to deal with owning plastic shower liners.
1,Mildews like crazy,"Looks nice for a while, then goes very brown/black. Even bleaching couldn't bring it back. I suppose if you had some way to keep it away from the tub so it could dry, this might not happen. But short of draping it over a chair or something each use, can't think of a solve. Pity, since fabric seems so much nicer than plastic."
2,What leaded beads??,"I got this nontoxic shower curtain liner under the impression that it has a weighted bottom that would prevent it from flying into the tub like my old liner, but was disappointed to find that it doesn't. What's going on? It doesn't match the online or package description. I think I'm going to have to resort to pinning it to my shower curtain."
3,Happy with it until it was washed,"Let me start by saying that I like things clean and fresh. When this liner started to show some mildew (yeeeuck) even after rinsing/cleaning out my tub after each use, I put it in the washer. Perhaps it is my fault for using a mild detergent, but it removed the water-resistance from the shower curtain liner and leaked through as soon as it was rehung and used. Aside from that, I loved the quality."
1,Unhappy with this item,The quality is very poor after several washings and being used the packaging crease's still exist. I could have purchased 10 at my local Dollar Store for the price of this one
1,DO NOT BUY,Like others i had mildew grow out of it after months. started stinking and got rusty on the top... i suggest dishing out a lil more for something better than this crap.
1,How did this curtain get so many good reviews?,"This shower curtain was well reviewed and that is almost always a sign of a quality product. It seemed well made when it arrived and did it main job perfectly, however, the metal rings around the rod hooks began to rust after less than a month (!!). This was a liner on a rather expensive designer fabric shower curtain and I'm not too happy that it left a rust stain on my expensive curtain. Out bathroom isnt overly damp, and it is a shower curtain for goodness sake, its gonna get wet, why make it out of a material that's going to rust?? I'm returning it, I hope I can get my money back."
5,Perfect,"I'm so glad I ignored the negative reviews here. This shower curtain ticks all the boxes:- it's fabric with an attractive stripe design so it doesn't trap water or stick to you when you touch it- strong steel eyelets- weighted hems so it drapes nicely and doesn't billowIn response to the negative reviews here:- if you have a problem with rust or mildew, don't complain about this product, ventilate your bathroom properly.- I don't get water penetrating the fabric, but it will soak through. It's fabric, after all."
2,Rabbits did not like,Not much to say on these would not buy again as my rabbits did not like them and for the price not many in the package.
3,"only good for rabbits, not guinea pigs","In the description the product claims its also ideal for guinea pigs. No way, my guinea pigs were dumping their bowl just to get the wacky wabbit food out of it. These guinea pigs appear to eat anything and everything, but they wouldnt touch those carrot sticks. It might be good for rabbits but guinea pigs dont like them."
1,Carrot and Alfalfa Twist,Not at all pleased with this product ordered from amazon. Yes I have purchased this product many times in the past from places such as Walmart/Petsmart and they have always been a hit with my bunny!!The product I rec'd was a dark brown off color compared to the orange color when purchased elsewhere. I was hesitant about giving these to my bunny as they appeared to be old and stale.. Thought I would give it a try. Bunny was not happy with them and ate them begrudgingly. I still have a couple left and plan to throw them away. The product is made in china so beware.I have now started purchasing the product at Walmart and PetSmart again. I need to find another alternative altogether..(Something that is not made in china) However this may be hard to do as my bunny enjoys the product and it is good for his teeth.
5,Can I give it 6 Stars?,"An outstanding film, Nicholas & Alexandra, brings to the screen the story of the last Russian Emperor Nicholas II and his family's tragic end at the hands of the Bolsheviks.Michael Jayston, Janet Suzman, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a gem of a movie that can be watched over and over again!The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the costumes, and the music are all wonderful!In short, Nicholas & Alexandra is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't already done so)!Highly recommended to those with a soft spot for History and all things Russian, along with the masterpieces Doctor Zhivago and the Barber of Siberia."
5,The fall of the Russian Empire,"As Elton John says in his song: ""It's enough to make kings into vagabonds""; here's a true story about how this happened to someone. This is a well-made film about the last Russian czar and his family. The movie starts out at the time of the Prince Alexander's birth during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05; when the czar's troubles began. We follow the lives of the imperial Romanov family from there to their eventual demise during the Russian Civil War. Michael Jayston and Janet Suzman portray the imperial couple quite well. The supporting cast is stellar with Sir Laurence Olivier leading the way. Fans of the Dr. Who television series get to see actor Tom Baker in an excellent portrayal of Gregory Rasputin. Even though just about anyone who studied history knows about the eventual fate of the Romanovs, the film is very informative and entertaining."
4,Nicholas and Alexandra,"A wonderful movie with excellent depictions of the Tsar and the Imperial family. The only innacurate part is the reference to Grigory Rasputin as ""Father Grigory"" whereas Rasputin was not a priest or a monk and he was never called ""Father Grigory"" by the Imperial family. In fact, he was usually referred to as ""Our Friend.""But apart from that innacuracy, it was overall a very good movie about the Romanov Family. Especially since they have been canonized as saints in December 2000."
4,liked it.,"I've read many books on this subject and felt like this movie told the story consistently with what I've read anyway.It is quite lengthy and unless you are interested in this time in Russian history, it may bore you, but I liked it andfelt that the performances by the main actors were wonderful."
5,Finally arriving on blu ray!,Just a reminder for those interested in having this film in high definition - Twilight Time through Screen Archives Entertainment ( SAE ) will be releasing Nicholas and Alexandria on blu ray February 12. From what I have heard it will contain a gorgeous new 4K transfer from Sony/ Columbia so I am looking forward to finally seeing this film looking as it should. The only drawback is that the blu ray is limited to 3000 copies.
5,a classic,"While it is true that the film does not stick precisely to the real story ( there are some vitals left out), the overall feeling of the times, and the lives of these misguided and imperious people is very well done. As far as the reviewer from Ohio goes, well, Alexandra was not brought up. exactly, IN England, but she visited her grandmother Victoria for all holidays, and it was Victoria who oversaw her education, plus she was raised by an English nanny, Mary Anne Orchard. As Alix said herself, the German language was her the language of her homeland, but the English language was her birthright. She spoke both well, was awkward in French and Russian, and the whole Russian family spoke English in their private home life, in deference to her. Naturally, she spoke Russian with a strong English accent, and any European who learned English spoke with an English accent, as Nicholas did."
2,Not Like Nicholas,"I appreciate other reviewers' lovely comments about the beautiful settings of this film but I was so irked by Michael Jayston's representation of Nicholas that I could not watch to the end. Michael Jayston is an actor I greatly respect and like but in this he showed Nicholas to be a humourless and very uptight man. What really irked me was the argument between Nicholas and Alexandra where Nicholas actually blames Alexandra for their son's haemophilia.Nicholas was a family man first and foremost; descriptions from those who knew him, speak of feeling at ease in his presence, and the warmth of his eyes and his smile. None of that came over in this film - instead he appeared to be permanently on the edge of exploding with temper.Having said all of that, the costumes, the era, the settings were beautiful.Most Beautiful Princess"
5,review of Nicholas and Alexandra,Tis is the story of the last czar of Russia and his family from the Russo Japanese war to theie execution by the bolshevics
3,"Good movie, but what's with the accents?","This movie offers an intriquing look into the lives of two of history's most tragic figures and is quite historically accurate. However it is quite distracting that all of the actors have British accents. Last time I checked people in Russia have Russian accents. While this is only a minor problem, it often distracts from the compelling story. Still, this film is interesting and historically correct and quite good. It would be better, though, if the actors actually spoke with Russian accents."
3,Where's the passion?,"This epic, set at the center of one of the most turbulent times in history, is intelligent and tasteful and may even be largely accurate in its account of events. But there's very little in the way of passion, spark to excite the viewer. It's like reading an encyclopaedia account of the Russian Revolution, written from the perspective of an attendant to the royal family. It's a bit sad, a bit wistful, but the three hours drag on without something more."
5,We are the History.,"It's a story,it's the past that we can't hold back.We must not be so dupe of what had happened.I watched it,I know it and I don't want to ask questions where the answers are there.We know the answers.Somehow rather,the movie is to me,very well done.It's enjoyable to me though there are few afflict scenes.It can happen to me,to you and to anybody.It's a story of the past that has shaped the World.I have also that documentary regarding Romanov.It's just that,when I learnt in school,at fourteen years old,I can't imagine how the Emperor and his Emperesse would look like."
2,Nicholas and Alexandra,I am very disappointed in my purchase from this seller because it is a DVD formatted for the U.K.(region 2) and won't play on a standard American DVD player. I feel ripped off. What recourse do I have?
3,HAS THE FEEL OF A 1970s MADE FOR TV DRAMA,"A fan of the book for some time, I was anxious to see the DVD. It's not bad. The leads have a great task and each has his/her moments, although they both become cloying too often. The film is 'eye filling' and detailed, but it all has the sort of faded look and feel of some 1970s, made for TV movie or mini-series (perhaps it was?), and as I watched it I realized much of this feeling is prompted by the musical soundtrack which intrudes constantly in Dr. Zhivago style."
2,"Nicholas, Alexandra, Alexei and Their Problems.","I must say that after viewing this movie once more, I am horrified at the horrible acting and the horrible script writing. Especially the pious Grand Duchess Tatiana showing her body to one of the Bolsheviks and crying to Olga about how ""I am so pretty, I want a man, wah wah wah""... the characterizations of the Imperial Family, if you have read about them, are just so under-defined. It's pretty much one of those movies that didn't look into the essence of Nicholas and Alexandra, the book, nor the personalities of the two loving rulers."
3,Nicholas and Alexandra,"This movie was alright, but terribly sad. I'm a big fan of the Romanovs (particularly the love story of the Tsar and Tsarina, LOL)! But I just feel upset whenever I watch it, more so when the music comes on. But I recommend it if you're a Romanov fan, too."
4,"Average Fante, but still excellent","I liked this book; and Im a big fan of Fante's. So, giving this book 4 stars means that I liked this book a great deal, but I liked Fante's Road to Los Angeles much much better.Still, I like Ask the Dust a lot more than I like the best work of other writers.For me, Ask the Dust lacked the rawness, brashness, energy... of Road to Los Angeles.It seems that by the time Fante got around to Ask the Dust he was a ""refined"" writer who was perhaps too conscious or guarded about what he let himself put onto the page.In The Road to Los angeles the main character Arturo, took us into the most private areas of his mind: the self-aware, the dreams, the ridiculous, and hurt. In Ask the Dust, were aren't allowed the same level of access.Still, I'd re-read Ask the Dust before re-reading some of my other favorites by Mishima, Tanizaki, Bataille, and others."
5,Ask The Dust - John Fante,"Ask The Dust By John Fante provided an enjoyable escape from life in the 21st century to the romantic, meanderings of a writer living in Los Angeles during the 1930s.Really, I was attracted to the book because of Bukowski's energetic intro and I was not disappointed.Ask the Dust (P.S.)"
5,Ask...,"Fante's Arturo so certain in his passion to create words, and prose, and the great novel, gets lost in his own soul on how to make sense of the passion of his heart. Set in depression era LA young Arturo finds obsession with his Camilla Lopez, instead of creating a torrid love affair with the autumn skin beauty, Fante creates a tumultuous, impulsive story of a young man in the grips of a fight between ego and heart, catholic morals and free spirit, love and loneliness. A wonderful story by a poetic writer."
4,I am the Great Bandini,"The Los Angeles of Fante is long gone. Still, through his story I felt like I was there in all of its beautiful sadness and glory. That is Fante's greatness. Beautiful tragedy. Through grit, he was able to weave a captivating story that made me feel I was in that part of the world in the mid-1930's."
2,"Come on, guys...","Look, I like Bukowski and bought this book... on the recommendations...but so what? It has the reality and Tom Waits style urban edge to it, but too much is off or missing. From his simply wrong attitude towards soft drugs to the unsatisfying gotta-kill-em-off end, I was taken less by the atmosphere of LA in the 30's than the annoyances. Perhaps I should read it again...there is some honest writing here, but by no means five-star stuff. And I like this period and setting, and Chandler for that matter...."
1,"For dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. -Genesis 3:19","This Bible verse is a sober reminder of death- the grim situation of sinful mankind separated from a holy God. What does this have to do with the John Fante's book? The book is as bleak and hopeless as death itself. Some people enjoy reading about hopelessness, monotony, boredom and despair. I don't. Not only is the book uninteresting, but I don't even enjoy the writing itself. Most books either have good writing, or a good story- only the great ones have both. This one has neither, not even close. On top of its total lack of quality, the book is unnecessarily crude. I wish I could think of something positive about this book (usually there is something) but all I can think of is that now I know to avoid Fante's books."
2,What would the dust say?,"I read this book because I like the tragic qualities of C. Bukowski's books; therefore, I assumed I would enjoy the writer who influenced Bukowski. I found Bandini weak and did not sympathize with him. He was his own worst enemy, and he still found it legitimate to moan and groan over his writing, expenses, and love interests. He senselessly degrades people and is perplexed when they do him wrong. Thumbs down."
2,I just don't get it.,"I read this book because several people with normally very compatible tastes in books with me recommended it. However, after reading this work, I just don't get the huge depth most other readers seem to find in this work. It just seems to me like another detached non-romantical romance that isn't very masterfully written. While the book is very non-assuming & direct, it lacks the substance its reputation carries. Want to read an ""Ask The Dust"" that's in your face & is a literary masterpiece, try Frank Norris' novel McTeague. Even though I seem to be the only person I know that doesn't really love this book, I don't think my opinion is off. This book doesn't ""do"" what it's ""supposed"" to do to me. The author's references to Aurturo Bandini (sp?) seemed more authentic than the exploits of the people in this novel."
2,A boring novel,"Despite being a useful piece of literary jigsaw for those interested in the author Charles Bukowski, this book has very little to reccommend it in its own right. It would seem Bukowski took Fante's idea for writing semi-fiction about his own experiences- circumstances, and added a whole lot of decent observation and humour. It does have a good ending but it comes way to late for me."
5,Incredible,Probably one of the greatest short fictions I have ever read. I wish he had published more work like this because he would have even an absolute legend
5,Loved it,"As other reviewers have said, if you are a Bukowski fan, you have to read this book. After going through a series of books that were so dull I felt like I had anvils on my eyelids, I decided to break my no-buy and get this book. Life is too short to force yourself through a tedious story. ANYHOO...This is one of those books that you do not want to put down but you do anyway because you don't want the story to end. I won't go into the specifics because there are probably dozens of reviews that will break the whole story down piece by piece. It's engaging, honest, funny and heartbreaking. It has jump-started my OCD and I now I must own all of Fante's books, and I've since then donated all the snoozefests to the library."
5,"A great American novel, or there's just no such thing","This book is simply essential. It's a gripping, incisive and utterly compelling romp through one misanthrope's astonishing mind.My fantasy course in 20th century literature would include this novel alongside ""Ham on Rye,"" ""Tropic of Cancer,"" ""Hunger"" .... Fante is a truly crucial writer. You're almost guaranteed to finish ""Dust"" in one sitting, so do yourself a favor.Denis Johnson, Sherman Alexie, Larry Brown, Barry Hannah, Pedro Gutierrez -- I'll bet all of them owe a debt to Fante."
5,deserving of attention,"One of the most underrated great american novels of the twentieth century. More honestly american than wolfe and more elegant than bukowski (his disciple), Fante, and ASK THE DUST in particular, deserves to be inserted into the canon of great literature americana."
3,The dust doesn't know,"Beautiful, melodic language and a poignant character drive this novel, and I can see how those who might identify with Bandini and/or like the Hunter-S.-Thompson-style of story telling (seemingly aimless wanderings and interactions) would get something out of it. Not enough happened for me though, and I am not particularly driven to read any of the other Bandini stories."
5,Another ring of the chain,"I was astonished to find another ring of the chain linking my favorite (Jack Kerouac) to the earlier writes: Fitzgerald, Hemingway, etc.. This must have been something really NEW for the times. Great !"
5,Nostalgia I missed,"I've pretty much always been interested in the first half of the 20th century in California & Arizona, where my father's family lived. Ask the Dust feels like my vague 1950s boyhood memories combined with my later emotions as a young man. I think of it as nostalgia that I missed by accident of birth. It's a tribute to John Fante that I feel as if I've been in his story. It was a very interesting place to be."
2,Bad Plot. No Biscuit.,"While The Fig Eater started out strong in story, mystery, and sexual tension, it fizzled out somewhere in the middle.As one review said, the picture it paints of early 20th Century Vienna is engaging. But it seems that Sheilds got so wrapped up in her research (Vienna, language, gypsy and other Eastern European folklore, and the like), she completely forgot about her characters and story development.By the end of the novel, I wasn't sure who I liked anymore (or was supposed to like), who I was supposed to be pulling for, and why I should care. And many themes that started off strong in the beginning (the fig, for one) were sort of forgotten by the end.I wouldn't recommend this novel, unless you're really into Vienna. Or, like me, need something quick to read in the airport and this is the only remotely interesting book the newstand has."
2,"What About Syphillis, the Fig, and the Thumb?","The Fig Eater by Jody Shields was a fascinating journey through Vienna. The details provided a good visual picture of the city, the characters, the method of crime investigation, and daily life of the period. I couldn't put it down until I finished it. But.....the ending did not deliver. Things that were fascinating such as the search and discovery of both the fig tree and thumb stolen from Dora's corpse were left unresolved.The title clearly implied that the ""fig"" was an important element of the plot - it was dropped......who excavated the body and stole the thumb. Clearly the implied murderer was not drawn as a gentlemen capable of getting his hands dirty. So, was it Jofsez the gypsy? How did syphillis figure in? The story seemed to imply that it was going somewhere with the disease. Ultimately, I was disappointed in this book which started out great, held my interest, and fell flat and left me feeling dissatisfied."
1,It's all about atmosphere?,"I was expecting to read about a murder, an investigation and a determination of facts. Instead I was continually drawn in to Ms. Shields research into Vienna's culture and her fascination with Gypsy mythology. Her writing seems to be pointed toward admiration of her own skillful research rather than creating a believable narrative.Only three people are given any voice in the story. She populates the book with a dozen characters who have no personality. I would have liked to get to know Herr Zellenka, Phillip, Otto, Egon, Franz....And, as usual in today's writing, Ms. Shields includes mention of sickening and gory affairs. After all, we have to let people know all this has been happening for centuries. What? Bestiality is still wrong. It doesn't improve by arbitrarily tossing it into a new book.The ""atmosphere"" is heady, but that's all there is to the book. The rest is just a sick plot without a real beginning or end."
1,The Fig Eater or Where is the Fig?,Ms. Shields decided to slap all her meticulous research on the pages instead of turning it into art. By the way could somebody tell me what ever happened to the fig?
3,INTERESTING,BEAUTIFUL DESCRIPTIONS AND MYSTERIOUSNESS OF GYPSY LIFE COULD NOT SAVE THE ENDING. THERE WAS SO MUCH EMPHASIS ON THE 'FIG' BUT NO RESOLUTION. BAFFLING.
2,Full of Loose ends,Things that didn't go anywhere:The figThe burned notebookthe pile of e*crement next to the bodythe cloak in the tree (how and why did it end up there?)The syphillisthe photographer/photographyThe thumbOtto's story (why was he in the tuberculosis ward if he wasn't originally sick?)
2,"Promising writer, weak book","Nothing really special here, although I do think Shields could write a better second book with some solid editorial guidance. It's obvious she didn't get any here. The book starts off strong, then quickly loses steam as the overripe descriptions of period Vienna eventually suffocate and flatten the mystery.The author has an interesting voice. Too bad it's wasted in this flawed and somewhat forgettable first effort."
2,I wanted to throw it against the wall too,"After I bought the book, not secondhand unfortunately, I went online and saw your reviews. I just glanced at the star rating and decided not to read the text of the reviews until I was finished. I was rapt through much of the book but the story did not tie together and what was the purpose of the fig after all the focus? I was so disappointed when I finished the book. My expectations were higher."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"What a waste of the authors time and effort. The concept and research involved in this novel drew me in but eventually I got bored and skimmed large sections. Although there were various lines I was following with enough interest to finish the book I was dismayed at the eventual outcome, which had nothing to do with any of these lines and was totally lame. It made the earlier parts of the book pointless."
2,unzufrieden,"I was intrigued until the end. I thought, `I have no idea who did it,' only to discover, neither did the author!"
1,Extremely disappointing,"This book is so disappointing because it had the potential to be quite good. It started out well, with a wonderful location and time period, unusual characters, engrossing atmosphere, and a shocking crime.Unfortunately, it all came apart very quickly. The Inspector and his wife evolved from unusual to overwrought, needy, secretive and selfish. The engrossing atmosphere went sour as the author padded the book with several contrived and irrelevant scenes. And the crime itself was solved in a ridiculous way that completely ignored the main clues of fig, excrement, and severed thumb.And finally, if there was any link between this story and Freud's Dora, I completely failed to see it."
1,Huh?,"I judged this book by it's cover (okay, so it was nice artwork) But, never again. The relationships were vague and disjointed and downright strange. I couldn't relate to any of the characters. And at the end of this murder mystery there were dozens of unanswered questions. Frustrating! A big waste of time, in my opinion."
3,The Fig Eater,"I was very consumed by the reading of this book. I was compelled to read as the interesting story unfolded. There were Holmes-like crime solving techniques and old fashioned investigating that made it a very engrossing book. However, I have yet to decide if the book was worth it in the end. There are a number of details that are completely unresolved and that are thrown in and given enough attention to in the formulation of the plot to warrent an explanation.As in real crime solving, there are many clues that are followed but that lead nowhere, which is entirely believable. However, there are some fundamental superstitious clues left behind at the scene of the crime that are never tied up. I would have liked to have some resolution to their inclusion in the book in the first place if they were not going to be relevant."
3,Fig pudding,"I have mixed feelings about this book. While beautifully and lyrically written with instances that draw you in and keep the pages turning--somehow it never pays off. All the clues and key pieces of the ""investigation"" by both the Inspector and Erzebet are never made sense of--the book draws to a close without putting the pieces together and leaving a tremedous amount of questions unanswered. Perhaps this was the writers intention, however they are too many pieces NOT in place that don't provide for a pay-oof. Mixed feelings--it could so easily have been a 5."
2,Disappointed,"Ms. Shields definitely did her research, but the result is the book almost reads like a research paper in parts, with multiple definitions and histories of figs, for example, and endless (pointless) quotes from the crime manual of the era, which I learned early on to skip. All of the characters were strange and unhappy, not a likable one in the bunch. I kept waiting for it to get better, but now I wish I had put it down before I got to the ""mystical?"" but dumb ending, and moved on to a better novel."
2,Disappointing,"I am a huge fan of Caleb Carr's The Alienist and Angel of Darkness. I am tired of any period novel being aligned with Carr's works. This pales in comparision to his fine novels. Ms. Shields' attempts at creating suspense are thwarted by her own inability to follow through. I don't know if this is a result of bad structure or bad editing. Either way, I found the novel to be a huge waste of my time."
1,Hated It....,"This is one of the very few books I absolutely could not get through (a rarity for me). By the time I had reached the middle, enough was enough and I put it aside. Though I will admit to peeking at the end to find out ""whodunnit"", I can't say I was particularly surprised at the outcome (seemed predictable to me; I had my suspicions of that character at the outset). What did bother me was the continual references to the occult, witchcraft, etc. Erzebet seemed to change from sweet to evil; but the characters in general were too flat to be bothered with. Overall, the narrative description was well-researched but, ultimately boring. I have no intention of finishing this book and wish I hadn't paid the money for it. A true example of not being able to judge a book by its cover."
1,Not a good book,"Someone chose this for our book club and not ONE person liked it. I tried to read the whole thing, some of the settings were appealing, however parts of it got so bizarre and it was just strange. Sorry to the author or anyone that likes it, but out of 12 women, not one person finished it or liked it."
2,Who Gives A Fig?!?!?!,"As someone who loves mysteries, and adored ""The Alienist"" particularly, this book was a huge disappointment to me. There were too many loose ends which Shields deliberately left undone. It was pretty mystifying wondering why Shields chose to weave the story together the way she did...it's not a satisfying way to construct a novel at all. I re-read the last few pages over and over again wondering at first ""Did I miss something here?""However, the way Shields evoked Vienna made me want to visit. She has a real talent for bringing a place to life even though most of her characters seem pretty wooden and aren't filled out enough.It also made me want to read more about Freud's ""Dora"" which was a more interesting character then the sketched out murder victim in this novel."
2,"Rich in culture and history, but poor story line","I picked up the book because I was intrigued by the description on the back of the book. What a disappointment! The author does a good job describing the life in Vienna in the early 1900's and Gypsy folklore, but the story line is unintersting and at times confusing. It's hard to get into the book."
2,very unsatisfying ending,"I felt this story was difficult to stick with. I put it down and picked it up over the course of over a month, primarily because I generally try to finish any book I have begun. The references to the inspector's criminal training was extremely tedious. It wasn't until the end when I was reading the questions for book clubs that I discovered a primary theme was ""hysterical women"" of the time. I felt the ending was abrupt and unsatisfying. It didn't naturally flow for me."
3,So-so,"I'd heard this was a great book, and I did get pulled in to the story; however, I have to agree that it did fall apart at the end. What started out as a good period mystery, fell apart towards the end with a sudden leap into the paranormal that wasn't really explained. Probably wouldn't recommend."
2,buy it for the cover...,the cover art is the best part of this whole book... the author seemed to have the right intentions but totally missed the mark.
4,Very interesting,"Perhaps if you've read ""The Alienist"" and then every single copycat that came out after it, you'd find this story a bit dull, but if you haven't, this is a very intriguing mystery. I particularly enjoyed the fact that we see both traditional detective work, performed by the nameless Inspector, and the more amateur investigations of his wife, Erszebet. The only thing that keeps me from giving this novel 5 stars is that it leaves a few loose ends. We find out who-dunit, but not other details that are also very interesting."
2,Index Cards,"Ms Shields packed this book full of odd facts, however, she forgot to develope her characters so the reader would care about any of them. After reading this novel in a book group, it was generally agreed that Jody had done her Masters Thesis on Viennese KafeHauses. Things happened for no apparent reason other than she an index card with a fascinating fact that just had to get in the book. All the male characters had major character flaws, or where maimed. The real Dora must have had a brother, and Jodie felt compelled to put him in the story but didn't work to hard at it. Ms Shields being an editor for DETAILS mag I foolishly thought she might have given fashion of the day more than a glossing over. Gloss is an excellent word to describe this book. I believe it would have been a better book if the editor had been stronger that the author and made her do the work."
3,Worth the struggle,"If you make it past the first 100 pages, you won't be disappointed. Initially, the Fig Eater is painstakingly slow. A body is found and all the reader gets is a laborious description of photography in the early 1900s. Were all the dust-jacket reviewers paid in cash for their glowing critiques? But hold on! Around about page 100, things start happening! Secrets are revealed - really hideous ones. Nothing is as it appears. Towards the end, you'll be turning pages as fast as you can. If only the first 100 pages were more enticing, this book would warrant 5 stars."
3,Atmospheric and intelligent,"The details of criminal investigations in historical Vienna are fascinating enough to make this book worth reading. Shields undertakes a study of photographic methods, of investigative techniques - both official and gypsy - and winds them into an intriguing plot. Of all the characters in this book, the Inspector's wife Erszebet stands out as an exceptionally interesting woman who ferociously guards her secret life. She is the perfect vessel for Shields to portray gypsy culture, and she steals the show. I was intrigued by her relationships with her husband and with Wally, but disappointed that those relationships never seemed to reach a proper climax. However, that may just be the way of Erszebet, a fascinating lady worthy of a sequel."
2,Yawn,Extremely disjointed and full of incomplete thoughts.This book had an interesting premise though.
2,I did not get it.....and I still don't!,"I purchased this book long ago...but for some unknown reason it must have fell in the library...anyhow, I just found it & read it. Yes, yes & yes..I agree with all the reviews: nicely written, lots of very specific details which indicate a great research, nice story.....but ...WTF?!! What the h*ll happens at the end?? Actually..Where Is The End?? When I finished it, I thought that, maybe, since I had misplaced it, maybe some parts (explicitly the last chapter!!) got tore up..maybe damaged..the Book Printing Co. forgot to print it. I mean, this could be the only logical explanation...otherwise: the fig, the thumb, the digging of the body, Joszef? What did they have to do with the story??? I kinda guessed who the potential killer was..but I did not care because I wanted to see how those pieces fit all together. Well..they don't.I never ever writing a book review.....but I was so frustrated (still am) that I had to share."
3,"Interesting, but plodding","This book got a lot of advance publicity, and it was based on the hype that I purchased the book in hardcover. I wouldn't advise other readers to do the same. It's an interesting book, an attempt to describe the state of criminal investigation during the Victorian Era, and the advent of psychological profiling. However, there were long stretches of writing, whole pages sometimes, that just went on and on and on - and I skimmed.Life during the Victorian years proceeded at a more leisurely pace than it does in our own era, but lordy, does the writing about it have to be just as slow?I think not."
5,An Entertaining and Peculiar Page Turner,"I couldn't get my nose out of this once I started. It's a crime novel, with vivid descriptions of turn-of-the century Vienna, a methodical inspector who reminds me of Sherlock Holmes, and his intuitive wife - working secretly, and with more occult methods, on the same strange case. Lots of twists, turns and strange, illuminating mental pictures keep your mind working in several directions, as you try to figure out the answers. The details are vivid and at the same time obscure, and worked well to give me the general creeps as I plowed through this unusual, engaging book. I liked it."
4,enjoyed this book,"I enjoyed this book very much. The time and place, the rich Hungarian and gypsy overlays were exotic and encompassing. The book had us follow all the leads, just as the inspector and his wife did. Unlike the other reviewers, I don't resent the false roads we took. If anything, it made the emotional journey -- the disappointment, frustration, confusion -- of solving the murder more real. I especially enjoyed the exacting of revenge issued by the Inspectors wife and Wally. I look forward to the author's next novel!"
2,Beautiful bore,"I adore literary historical fiction, but gave up on The Fig Eater halfway through--something I almost never do--because of the dragging pace (excruciatingly slow even for literary fiction), half-realized and uninvolving characters, and the frequently self-indulgent artiness of the author's prose. The use of the self-conscious present tense (a choice that, in my opinion, should be used only for good reason, and sparingly, to set off particular sections of a novel) for the entire narrative didn't help matters. Nevertheless, it's obviously well-researched and 1910 Vienna is described in lush detail. It's too bad the plot and characters don't live up to the evocative atmosphere the author created."
2,Read the reviews before buying.,"I really struggled with this book and the only thing that got me through it was the hope that in the end, it would all come into fruition. I was sadly disappointed. Too many unanswered questions, no closure, and the ending was just bad, bad, bad. It was not the intriguing murder mystery I was looking for."
2,What a letdown...,"I loved living in 1910 Vienna - the book was wonderfully researched, and was masterful at portraying the characters and times. And, the mystery grabbed ahold and held on - and seemed like it was really going to have a ""whammo"" ending. But no - and don't you feel like you've wasted a bunch of time when that happens. In this case, the read was interesting enough that I don't feel totally robbed, but disappointed - oh yeah! Most of all, I was lured by the title and the search for the fig tree, which seemed to gain in significance with each page, only to end in a total fizzle. We found it - so what? This book had such potential - what a shame. Surely someone along the way - agent, editor, publisher - read it and saw its shortcomings. With all the glowing reviews, one wonders if anybody really read it. Jody, fire them all and start with a new crew. You are a great writer and I'll take a shot at your next one."
2,S---L----O----W,"It starts out intriguingly but then goes nowhere so slowly.....It has lots of nice historical touches, but none of the suspense and pacing that a great mystery requires. I think this was her first novel, and it shows."
3,Annoying/intriguing/meticulous,"The book is well written but without soul or wit. I enjoyed the well researched historical references to daily life, criminal science and the almost drawn characters. But...geez, so many loose threads througout and with the sketchily drawn characters, I'm amazed I didn't just throw the book across the room. However, the writer does keep you riveted even if you can't stand it. I had to know, had to find out! Once I did, I felt I'd been reading a different book. DON'T YOU HATE THAT!!!Well written, but dry."
3,"Hard to start, but interesting nonetheless","I don't really know what I thought of this book. It was very difficult to get into, but once I did, I found myself intrigued. I especially enjoyed the parts dealing with the relationship between Wally and the Inspector's wife. As for what others have said is Shields' overabundance of detail in the descriptions of Vienna, I didn't really notice that. I feel like I should give this another read, though. Somehow unsatisfying but can't quite figure out why. I get the impression that other reviewers feel this way, too. I look forward to seeing what else Shields does."
2,DISAPPOINTING BOOK BECAUSE OF UNRESOLVED LOOSE ENDS,Publisher's Weekly got it wrong with its claim of atmospheric suspense. The murder mystery began with a strong opening and then quickly became a plodding chore to read. The principle reason for the change was that there were just too many loose ends. The author provided three potentially interesting tidbits that provided a real opportunity for exploration and yet there was no follow through. The most obvious missing threat was the figs themselves. The reader is left wondering why this very essential part the novel simply disappeared. This was also true of the uniquely introduced subplots of the thumb and syphllis.The theme of the book had real potential but the delivery was disappointing.
2,Disappointing,"Disappointing is the most appropriate word to describe this book. I thought the premise was exciting and the book really should have been so much more than it was.The amount of loose ends was staggering. And the anticlimatic ending really made me regret my purchase. The book was full of too many minute details that did nothing to help the story along.Although, the author certainly proved that she did a great deal of research on the period and subject matter of the piece."
4,Delicious to sink your teeth into.. if slightly light weight...,I really enjoyed this read. It was both engrossing and stylish... it had elements of the unknown mixed with historical fact and the elegance of a Wharton ghost tale... The only flaw I detected was that the set up was immense and the pay off... ordinary.. I would have liked a more substantial solution to this crime.. but the writing style was graceful and enjoyable... a pleasure.
2,Ugh! Like slogging through mud,"I read this over a year ago, and I STILL think about how bad it was. It looked like the kind of story I really like, historical novel; murder mystery. Ms. Shields made it incredibly difficult to even understand what was going on. I never seemed to know where the characters were, and how their actions related to the last thing they were doing. To add insult to injury, Ms. Shields adds a confusing layer of Gypsy mythology to everything the protagonist does, liberally sprinkled with Hungarian words I immediately forgot. When the story finally resolved itself, I couldn't care less."
3,Slow and laborious reading,"This book was highly recommended by a friend, but I've really struggled to get into it. Shields' writing style, which may be an attempt to capture the period, is a bit grating. The story itself is an interesting one, but the storytelling leaves something to be desired."
3,A taste of the obscure,"This novel was one of those peculiar adventures that comes along to remind the reader of the infinite ways of looking at a murder. The dutiful inspector plods along, doing his forensic research and hoping for insight. He is followed closely by his wife, knowledgable in the ways of women and myth. She is fascinated by this case and wraps herself in the endless permuations of this simple mystery. A bit of a hothouse flower herself, she seems to come more alive and fascinating to her husband through the nights they share with eachother. He is somewhat blinded to all else, and she continues on, as women do, closing the door on the mystery and going home to bed. The botanical descriptions are a vivid contrast to the blinding snow, and the sometimes twisted natures of the suspects. A period piece, I will offer it to friends who will enjoy the unusual and sensuous nature of this tasteful story."
1,Fig Cheater,"Huh? What happened to the ingested fig? To the excrement in the park? To the severed thumb buried in the floor? Yes these are major fuel sources that (up to a point) propel the plot forward. What happens, even in the broadest of terms, to the characters? To Wally for instance? Atmospheric yes and in some ways gripping but what a stinker of an ending.For Amazon to sell this book with (and by implication to compare it to) the exquisite ""Shadow of the Wind"" shows either a seriously impaired scheme for pairing books (set in 20th century Europe seems the only obvious similarity) or a desperate attempt to pawn off an overrun of lousy books on the coat tails of a great one."
2,Boring,"I thought the book started out as if it would be a good read; but after a few pages it became very disjointed and just plain boring. I know the author did a lot of research to write the story, but it just didn't come together, and I never had any empathy for any of the characters. I was glad when I finished the last page."
2,the protectors are too thick,I recently bought these screen protectors with my new Toshiba 335. I like the PDA but the screen protectors are too think. Thjey blurr the image and they are not very transparent. I use to have a handspring and the screen protectors from Fellows were much more transparent. I guess they do the job but I will not purchase this product again.
1,DO NOT BUY,"Please do not waste your money... I pasted it onto the screen and had some air bubbles under... so when I tried to take if off the touch pad screen itself came off along with the screen overlay. I called Toshiba Customer Support, he created an RMA and I mailed the PDA over and I get a call from the Tech Support and they said the screen is not covered under the warrenty and I need to pay to get it fixed. The bad part is I had to pay $129 to get it fixed. The worst part is the tech support guy should have recommended me to sign-up for the SystemGuard Accidental Damage Coverage first for a little bit more and then fix it for FREE under the plan. That way I would have the extended warrenty and also the PDA fixed. I guess now its too late. Anyways, So please be careful when taking the overlay off if you already have pasted one."
4,its a great cd.,"if didnt get it yet, get it. its pretty good - pretty standard for hardcore, if youre a hardcore phreak, BUY IT."
1,SUCKES,"This cd sucks. Why did fat mike sigh this band to his label? All that this band does is scream, and half of the time you can't even understand what he's saying. This band is not even punk half of the time. This band should move to heavy metal. This is a band that has no talent!! Call to arms is a bad cd, and all the other ones are too!!!!!!"
3,Pretty Weak When Compared To the Rest,"As catchy as some of the songs on this album are, the sad truth is ""Call To Arms"" is incredibly weak when compared to other releases by Sick Of It All. Their best work, that I've heard (I don't have any of their OLD old stuff) was easily on ""Scratch The Surface,"" and prolly ""Built To Last."" Although ""Built..."" also had a sound that was more poppy, as this one did, it kept a harder edge that reminded me of ""Scratch..."" or ""Yours Truly"" one of their later albums. Still better than most of the wannabe-hardcore crap you hear on Epitaph and Fat, but considering the bands history, ""Call To Arms"" was one helluva letdown. I still pop it in every now and again, but its been awfully hard for this album to win me over when they have so much better music out there already."
1,slanted summaries,"As one who has extensively researched this area, I was surprised to find many pertinent articles supportive of the existence of ritual abuse absent from the bibliography. Other articles which I have read were summarized to exclude supportive content. The author herself states in the preface, ""My own scholarship on the ritual abuse controvery, which is cited in this annotated bibliography, is critical of both the notion of ritual abuse and the collective reactions to it.""(p. 4) I found myself unwilling to rely on de Young's summaries, but did locate some articles that I wished to read for myself."
1,Below Expectations,I was extremely disappointed with this CD. The music and overall performance by the North Carolina Mass Choir was far below my expectations. The only saving grace was the fact that this CD was relatively inexpensive.
4,I liked it.,This is an excellent book in turning rocks into cute little cottages. I particularly like how Lin Wellford's books are very detail oriented. I plan to use this book this week to make a bird house super cute.
5,Great project for children & adults!,Love these series of books - Great for kids & adults .... Step by step (no fail) instructions - Highly recommend (buy these for all of my favorite crafters) ...Have all of her books!
5,Fun and Useful,"I really love Lin Wellford's Rock Painting books, and I love ""Painting Houses Cottages and Towns on Rocks"" especially! I enjoyed adapting some of the cottage designs to make ""hobbit holes"" instead, and have adorned my yard and garden with a number of her clever designs! The instructions are so clear and well written, with excellent photographs to accompany them! I'd reccommend this to anyone wanting to give decorative painting a shot!"
3,???????????,Never recieved this product. Some kind of mix up in the shipping. When I contacted the seller they tracked it for me and could not explain the problem and refunded my money within 3 or 4 days my money was back in my account!
2,Wrong description,"First, I love pyrex, but the description on this one is entirely off. It says that it is 14x5.2x9.2. It isn't anywhere near that big, more like 8x6. It holds 6 cups but doesn't say it anywhere in the description. The rectangular container that holds 11 cup says it's dimensions are smaller that this one so I would have assumed that this container was larger. The description needs to be corrected. It is very misleading"
5,My favorite book as a small child,"I loved this book so much and still have my original copy. The illustrations are so cute and are reminiscent of Holly Hobby. As a little girl, I loved the fact that Sarah was going on a picnic with her dolls, evey place she stops people give her good things to eat to add to her picnic basket. In the end Sarah realizes the picnic would be a lot more fun with her friend Dan so she helps him finish his chores and they go together. A picnic with dolls and her best friend, plus Sarah could feel pleased that she'd done the right thing by helping her friend. It had a message, friendship with a boy who accepted her dolls :) and chocolate cake - what could be better?"
3,"Ok, but way out of date","This book has some interesting information, but it is WAY outdated. A lot of the information isn't accurate any more. It paints an extremely rosy picture of the airline industry. Of couse, anybody who's interested in an aviation career now knows that the industry is in the toliet and it's a pretty tough career to get into. If you can get it used here for a buck like I did, go for it, it's somewhat useful, but I certainly wouldn' buy it new."
3,kinda' interesting,"gives a little info on the career path, not much new info for someone in the business already. talks about job outlook: extremely outdated! Eastern Airlines? Good book for someone young but keep researching through other books. I don't regret buying it."
5,"Blues and jazz from Basie, Big Joe, Cleanhead and company","Oh, yes, this is so beautiful!If I were being objective I might have sided with the reviewer who complained on the arrangement and choice of big band and/vs small groups,but I enjoy so much listening to Joe Turner and Eddie Vinson singing, backed up by various sized Basie ensembles...AND there are very nice small group Basie style tracks... Whether it's Cherry Red or Just a Dream on My Mind, Everyday I Have the Blues or Stormy Monday, this is great blues and great jazz...There are some VEEEERY nice instrumental solos and obligatos,it's only a pity the players are not listed in the sparse liner notes (well, Basie is on the piano, naturally, while Eddie Vinson kicks a** on alto sax!"
3,Basie and the blues singers,Cleanhead Vinson and Big Joe Turner backed by Basies band and a few instrumentals too. It's great to hear Vinson and Turner backed by Basie but they really could have used the big band a bit more and given the album a little more energy. That's why I gave it only 3 stars. Still worth owning though if you like big band blues.Well recorded.
1,Wrong part; bad search,"I ordered this thinking that I was getting a wrench to remove the water plug on my RV water heater. However, this wrench does not fit an RV and is really a residential hot water heating element wrench. I believe that this product is mislabelled by the Amazon search engine. Additionally, the supplier requires that you call for an RMA before returning the product and charges a restocking fee. I will look elsewhere for future purchases."
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad","Ok. Let me just say that I LOVE the Fairly Oddparents Television show. I bought this game the day it came out. I was horrified when I started to play it. All you do is kill bad guys. It is not even half fun. Another horrible thing about it is that you have to enter passwords to start from where you were, instead of saving. The passwords are like 10 digits long. They're horrible. You can't tell the difference between an I and a 1 in the password. If you are a big Oddparents fan, like me, I suggest that you RENT IT, before you buy it."
1,Baddest Game Ever,"If You Like The Show And You Think This Game Will Be Cool,You Are Wrong,It Is Nothing Like The Show.The Show Is Good But The Game Isn't!So Stay Away From This Game Period!!!"
3,This book the same as The Syndrome,You can buy The Syndrome for a normal price via Amazon. Apparently it has been published in the UK and Commonwealth nations as Trance State.
4,My son loves it!,I bought this for my son and I was wondering how it was going to hold up to the upcoming battles he talked about. 4 months later it is still intact. Of course it did get lost in the woods for a few weeks.
5,Fantastic Staff,This was a fantastic staff that I ordered to go with my halloween costume as I could not actually find a walking staff. It arrived within three days after I ordered it and the Traveling Renaissance Sorceress costume that I was using was a hit.
3,"Written for women, what about us guys?","As a male, I was really disappointed with the authors attitude towards men. This book is written for women. There are chapters entitled ""how to tell if he is a couch potato,"" and one on male chauvinism. Unfortunately for male readers who want to use astrology there are no corresponding chapters such as ""How to tell if she is a critical shrew"" or something like that.I think the title should indicate that this is a guide for women. The astrological profiles are mostly of males for the female readers.As for the astrological accuracy of the book, I have no criticism of that, as I don't have the background to judge it."
1,A disappointment,"I was not happy with the author's general analysis of Air/Fire and Earth/Water signs. All elements should have been broken down SEPARATELY as they are too unique in their own right to be lumped together as they were in this book. The book is extremely biased, making Water and Earth seem good and Fire and Air look awful. As someone who has dealt with quite a few water signs, particularly Scorpio and Cancer, I was very surprised that the selfish, controlling and manipulative tendencies of those signs were not explored more in this book. A complete disappointment."
3,Disappointingly Familiar,"The Bottom Line:The first 30 minutes or so of this drama/comedy, as Robin Williams defects to America and faces quite the culture shock in his new country are quite engaging and amusing, which makes it all the more depressing when the film reverts to a standard, tired film about his relationship with Maria Conchito Alonso; Moscow on the Hudson worth a look if can you relate to the experiences portrayed in the first half, but it's just not a very good movie.2.5/4"
1,Waste of money...,"The part in Moscow is plain stupid and too far from the reality. And using Russian with subtitles does not help, just hurts. Especially for somebody who knows Russian, because they speak Russian with terrible accents (which is not usual there). It's like judging on how to care for a cat by Garfield comics, just take out the humor.New York part is hectic, but for a convinced Mid-North-westener there is nothing new in this statement, so it's probably realistic enough. Unfortunately, it's just not very interesting either."
4,A Forgotten Gem of Robin Williams,"One of Robin Williams Early works and Sadly a Forgotten Gem of him. Sometimes Sad, Sometimes Funny as can be it showed his range and abilities even then. He Plays a Russian Circus Musician Tasked to keep an Eye on his friend who has made ""Noises"" about defecting when the Circus Travels to NYC. Don't want to ruin the Story or Surprises (If you are surprised) but this is a wonderful Story that will take you from Sad to Happy to Laughing and back again.If you liked Dead Poets Society you will LOVE this."
4,Perfect for Russians!,"This film cathces so many elements of the Russian emigre experience, even the unspoken ones that they keep hidden. I've never seen a Russian watch this without breaking into tears and laughter. Although the ending is a lillte contrived, it's a good time for all who watch it."
4,What terrible accents?,"The reviewer who mentioned the terrible accents I think didn't even realize that a lot of the people in this film are actually Russian...as Robin Williams would have said in Moscow on the Hudson...get a clue MEESTOR! This is a great film and very funny. At times it overdoes it on the flag waving, but it's still a charming film!"
4,Good little movie.,We had seen it many years ago and really liked it. It hasn't been on TV in a long time so I purchased it.Robin Williams is a very good and very believable actor. We really enjoyed it.
5,Russia Meets Ny,You Can't go wrong with mr. Williams. This movie is hillarious. i recommend it for everyone
3,Not too bad...in combination with other books,"Well, I went ahead and bought this book despite my reservations. I am not exactly sorry I did, as I find the information useful, but only in combination with other reference books. The line drawings of the designs are alright. The patterns are organized alphabetically, which is great if you know the name of the pattern you are looking for...I don't. However, I think that with time, it will be a valuable resource. Definately not for the novice collector."
3,Quality of Book,"The quality of this book is wonderful, good binding, the cover not damaged. But when I was looking through it, it didn't have the information that I wanted. I was looking for a certain bowl that I broke (it was my grandmother's) and wanted to replace it. I guess I'll have to keep looking for a catalog to replace my item. The book gives wonderful history on Fostoria."
5,Just as described,I love the larger magnets so I don't have to worry about my 2 year old choking on them. Great product!
4,Mostly a good toy,"My little girl loves them, but we did not receive the letter 'q', so 4 stars. The magnet location looks good and it seems these will hold up well."
5,Why oh why stop making this flash,"This is a great flash. No fancy bells or whistles, but does a great job. It was also very affordable. Why oh why did Sunpak have to discontinue this flash? Let's hope they bring it back."
5,SUNPAK 383 SUPER,"This flash is the perfect back-up for a studio, or Main/flash fill for an amateur studio. I use several w/slaves and lines and the images rival set-ups that cost thousands of Dollars. I like that they are light and easy to pack and transport. They are reasonably priced. They have been around for a long time and do not have bells and whistles. The SUNPAK has auto/f-stop and manual. If you are a real photographer, you will know how to use them. The down side is that if your SUNPAK is plugged into a wall, it takes far too long to recharge (sometimes 3-5 seconds). Rechargeable batteries seem to work the best with 1-3 second recharge times between flashes."
5,Bright Flash.,"Real bright flash,work great with my camera.Lights up a long way, away,getting more into my pictures.Camera flash isn't enough flash,383 flash makes up what the camera can't reach."
4,Classic Le Creuset!,"I love this pan! It is perfect for so many things, especially on pan meals! The only problem, in my opinion, is the black coating. I know they use this coating on frying pans so that you can fry at a higher temp, but the inside never looks nice. It is not non-stick, but I definitely prefer the light gray interior. Overall, though, this one is a keeper!"
2,Two stars are all I could find.,"The stars tell it all. The future is not happening for this book. But I don't want to be a shrew, so I'll just say, I don't like to be bored while reading and leave it at that."
2,Secrets of the Aztecs and The Aztec Empire,Okay so the DVD by A&E called secrets of the Aztecs is EXACTLY the same as the DVD by History Channel called The Aztec Empire. The only difference is that Leonard Nimoy is the narrator of one and not the other. Total waste of money. All it talks about is how the Aztecs liked to sacrifice people and babies! No real HISTORY of the Aztecs or anything like that. Save your money!
5,Training simulator,"I have recently ordered 12,000 copies of this game as a battle simulator for my clone army, Thanks to the amazing life like scenarios and effective combat strategies, don't be surprised when you find my unstoppable army of clones crushing all those who oppose us with relative ease. Truly an amazing buy, I truly believe it to be worth every penny."
4,Fun,"This is a fun game (for the most part), probably one of the better Star Wars games I've played. There aren't too many levels to chose from or modes to play, so it can get kinda boring after a bit, but that's when you give it a break for a while and come back to it later! It'll be just as fun after that! So yeah, give it a shot, it's fun. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
5,Best game ever,if you are thinking about getting or rentting this game do it because it is probly one of the best star wars games on the market
5,Best PS2 online game EVER!!!!!,"Although the single player version of this game is fun but not that impressive, that isn't the reason why you should buy this AWESOME game: its all about the online play. With lots of servers out there, you will soon become an experienced player... and then can take it up to the next notch by playing with other experienced, competitive, and very good gamers (HINT: play at night). Its hard to explain how great of an online game it really is, but believe me... its better than any other online battle game i've ever played (including Halo, Call of Duty, Battlefield 1942 and Socom I and II).I have never been a big gamer and I bought this game in February because I had grown tired of it... but 6 months have passed and I still LOVE playing this game. I would recommend a headset which, gives you a more strategic facet of this game.TWO THUMBS WAY UP!!!!!!!"
5,Star Wars Battlefront,"My son loves this game. I can hear him playing it from the other room and it's cool how the game will tell him which way to go by stating comments such as ""over here"". Great game."
3,Gets old,"Star wars battlefront is an ok game. Chose you faction from star wars, chose type of troop, attack enemies. The game in centered around capturing these ""command posts"" which look like hologram projectors in the middle of enemy territory. You can play on many different battlefields from the movies, including 2 not shown in movies. There is 2 battles from star wars 1, 2 from ST 2, 2 from ST 4, 2 from ST 5, and 1 from star wars six. The game is very fun, even better in multiplayer, but don't play too much, it will get old after a while."
2,"Ok, but can't compete with SOCOM 1 or 2","The idea behind the game is to keep attcking and taking over enemy checkpoints. The graphics are pretty good, but operating the vehicles stinks. The X-Wing, Y-Wing, Tie Fighter, etc are cool but it's like trying to drive a dump truck in a two car garage. Online the characters move very slow across a board and you are stuck with the weapons your character starts with. I own both SOCOMs and nothing compares to that online gameplay. The online play here is a constant respawn until one team occupies and kills the other teams reawn points, and knocks out their 250 soldiers/droids. Headsets due work, but it is a constantly open mike. I recommend renting it but don't buy it."
4,thsi game is really good but......,the grapics sometimes can screw up and there could be more battle fields but al and all its a really good game(but star wars battlefront 2 is WAY BETTER!!!!!!)
5,Harmless Fun!!,"Ahhhhh killing in the Star Wars universe, is there anything more fun? Well besides maybe watching a Star Wars movie that is. Battlefront takes us into the world like Metal of Honor or the actual Battlefront games for PC. Where your life is a rather short one (unless you're lucky), and spawning is a common thing. In this direct assult adventure it's very easy to get lost in the intense battles that are happening all around you. The most impressive fact has to be the multiplayer modes both splitscreen and online as well. Playing either against or with a team or one other player increases the fun ten times fold. I'd say the only draw-back is the limited number of maps. However large they are, there just isn't that many to really make your mouth water. There is a second Star Wars battlefront in the works for November release with a larger number of maps and size as well. So maybe you'd be better off waiting. But in the mean-time you might as well go for this title here. Enjoy!!"
4,"Great fun, but not a repeat","This game is an absolute blast the first few times you play it. There are many modes so that no two plays are alike. However, it is not the type of game that you play a million times over even after you've beaten it. Overall, a great buy."
4,Still not sure,"Although not as good as other reviewers are making it out to be (for god sake, do you guys get a percentage of the profits?), this is still a great game. It's not a five-star game, but lots of options, many different battle areas, mixed with some already existing loyalty to the name, and you've got something pretty fun, definitely worth owning. I still haven't beaten it yet, so take that into account, but so far so good."
5,Great Game,"Star Wars BF is a great game, one of the best games available right now. It's best suited for online play and is a nice respite from Socom II which can be overly complicated. Star Wars BF is challenging, take skills, but is easier to play. I play both but right now find it to be more fun. True the combat can be very chaotic and random at time but hey it's just a videogame and you spawn back right away. 5 STARS!!!!"
2,Rushed,"This game had such high hopes. Unfortunately it was rushed out to coincide with the release of the trilogy on DVD. The major draw is, of course, online play. Online play however is truly awful. The PS2 version is totally handicapped by a poor online lobby. You can only see about 6-7 games at a time and you can't scroll down fast enough to choose one. The PC games shouldn't even be listed since you're on a PS2. Why? It just clogs up the lobby. And I'm not a big fan of gamespy anyway, so that's 2 strikes. You can only play against 3 other human players, so you may as well play single player. Oh well. Do yourself a favor and rent this one or wait until it's only 20 bucks or so. This really hammers home the point that George Lucas only cares about the greenbacks."
3,GOOD GAME!,I love this game. My sons and I play it a lot . It was a gift for my son. The only thing wrong was the description said it came with a manual. When it did not..
3,After an hours worth of play...,"I just got this game today and have only played it for about an hour. It is NOT for the impatient. You do not have the flexibility to really choose whatever character/vehicle you want from each of the battles (you get a few to select from). And you can't just choose any battles you want. Some of the battles are unique to the game only and did not appear in the movies. The controls are not intuitive. The control directions in the instruction manual are printed black on black and are difficult to read. Over all, I'd say it's an average game. I don't see myself spending hours playing it, like the Lord of the Rings games."
5,Star Wars Battlefront,Star Wars Battlefront was a great game when it came out for the PS2. i still think its a good game to go back to. 10/10
5,Star Wars Battlefront,Video Game was entertaining.Video Game arrived in a very timely fashion.Video Game arrived in excellent condition.
5,awesom,"I recommend this game to everyone. I am a huge star wars fan and have been addicted to it sience I bought it the day after it came out. I know a lot of people who came over to play it and they hated star wars, but they loved the game. The action is intense and packed full of suprises. The vehicle designs are incredibly realistic and overall graphics are good. My favorite level is the Battle of Hoth. In the mission you can pilot a snow speeder like in the movie and protect the shield generator agaainst the giant AT-ATs and hundreds of invading imperials. There really isnt too many levels yet the replay value is more than any game ever! When you are down to 10 clones verses 40 droids in an all out assault, you will fall over from the lasers flying in every direction. If you like action games you will love this game just like me! THIS IS FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST STAR WARS FANS, and in my opinion, it has more action that Halo!"
4,Pretty good.,"I've owned the game only for a few months. I've been a Star Wars fan for a long time and I just loved it when they came out with this game. I've always wanted to be a Storm trooped trudging through the snow on Hoth to attack the Rebel base and this game actually let's me do just that. The game is overall pretty good, except for the fact that the flying controls aren't really that sensitive so you wouldn't be pulling off any fancy mid-air manuevers in it. On certain levels you also can fight against not only the enemy, but the actual inhabitants of that level. Like on Endor, if you were the fighting agaist the rebels, you would also be fighting against the little Ewoks. Overall a good game, I would suggest buying it."
3,ok at best...,"it's fun for a while. it's nice to drop in to legendary star wars battles like on hoth, but it gets old real fast because there really isn't a lot of depth to the game. if you are looking for a great star wars game, this isn't it... try knights of the old republic (I, not II it was cr@p) as it is a truly wonderful star wars game. this one's ok if you want to drop in with a couple of friends and blast each other with stormtroopers and the like. but no playing as jedi, that'll come in battlefront II. battlefront is an average star wars game."
4,pretty good game,"i like star wars alot, and this game is a really good one because you can be a regular soldier, not just a secret agent or a spy, you can be a minelayer or a piolit. i like the jetpacks and the crab things and the bazooka guys. i also like to blast people's butts with the big at-ap or whatever thing and snipe people on the snow planet. the ships are cool, and i just wish that the guys that made it didn't make the fighters move automtically. other than that, it's a really fun game."
2,A good rental,"Battlefront was fun for about a day or two. It would be best to rent it before you buy it. This game is a little disapointing like some other star wars titles in the past (Clone War, Power Battles)and it's not really worth the $49.99 price tag. There is just something missing.People who are calling this the ""GTA Vice City of Star Wars"" are crazy. The controls for the X-Wings and Tie fighters are so clunky and the big battle campaigns can be completed in a couple of hours on the hardest setting. Don't get me wrong it IS fun but it does not live up to the hype."
3,Probably better for multiplayer,"Disappointing. I've only had it a few weeks and have used up all the entertainment value I'll get from it. Just not that impressive in one-player mode. All the nooks and crannies and hiding places are pointless because the enemy does not attack, but waits for you to attack him. The levels are pretty basic, and don't stand up to repeat playing. Much of the game controls are clunky, especially flying.Overall... some entertainment value, but a game that was clearly designed with multiplay in mind."
3,"Very fun, but repetitive","The only purpose for this game is multi-player. And multi-player on consoles usually blow, so I'd suggest buying this game on the PC.Other than that aspect, the single-player mode isn't bad. It's just plain fun. But it's plain repetitive. Every mission is the same: ""Kill all the enemies to win,"" The only difference is that the difficulty increases each battle. I wouldn't recommend this game to purchase unless you're going to buy it on the PC."
1,Star Wars Battlefront,I ordered this game for my grandson. It is the first time I ever ordered a used game but the description said it was in like new condition. Well the game freezes up when he tries to play it and I no longer have the receipt to return it. I am very disappointed and will not order used merchandise again.
3,Force no more!,"I learned that you can't use the force, because I jumped out of my window and the force didn't save my bungholio, good thing i landed on my grandmom, and her big bungholio made my fall soft and cushiony!"
1,Big disspointment for ps2,"I waited and waited for this game to come out, then ran to get it. Boy, was i dissapointed. Playing the game doesnt have that cinematic feel. You feel immersed, but with no control. There is no real evolution as such. Just a shoot em up. Thats it! Graphics are ok. I sold mine the same day. Am going to buy an XBOX with KOTR. Ive had it wating for ps2 to get some good star wars games together. Never gonna happen......."
4,Fun game,"This is a great overall strategy/combat game (even if it wasn't Star Wars). An easy game to play (some may argue a little too easy!) You can select from a number of specialized troops from any side, any era. I also love hearing the music from all the movies. All around good game with good graphics and a high replay value.The only downside, the battlefronts aren't expansive enough and other planets could be included (Correscant for example). Also the pilots could use better weapons. Otherwise, great game!"
3,Great fun for a few days.,"My expectations for this game were unreasonably high, I will admit. I am a HUGE Star Wars fan and love these type of action games. I thought this would be the best game ever.High Points: Huge battle fields, Awesome weapons, great sense of being in the movies.Low points: Extremely easy to beat even on hardest difficulty. Once you figure out the strategy needed for each map it is no challenge. Extremely long load times. Computer controlled opponents and allies not very bright.While it may seem that I am being a bit too harsh, I did really enjoy this game. It is just the level of difficulty was so low that after a couple of days it was beat and boring. The replay value goes up if you play multiplayer online, but the servers were not reliable and too many online players cheat.My suggestion is definitely rent this game. You will love it for the couple of days you have it and beat it before you have to take it back."
4,Cool,"This game is cool but easy, I played this game for three hours and beat it. There also should be jedi fighting. So if you like Star Wars, get it."
5,most essential primary information,succint and comprehensive coverage of the basics of healthy living .reviews about air water and food .must read for everbody.
1,You'll get weary reading this book,"While 12 mph is a reasonable pace for a long-distance bike ride, the pace through this book is sluggish. This diary is also way too complete. It has the names of all the places they ate and the names of perhaps 80% of the waitresses. I think one premise of the book was simply to talk to as many people as possible and recount their stories - no matter how uninteresting. Many more interesting accounts of biking across the country can be found on the web. I must say that I've only read a little less than half of the book and don't plan on reading any more. There are no photographs, maps, diagrams, lists or tables of information."
5,You won't want to put it down!,"It has always been a dream of mine to bike cross country and after reading ""America at Twelve Miles an Hour"" I'm so inspired! This account goes well beyond a typical travel narrative - it recounts the trials and (humorous) tribulations of life on the road. Phil Shrout gives us a unique glimpse of the people and places in America that most of us will never get a chance to see...but this book will make you feel like you're along for the ride."
3,So far NOT so good,"The stitching on the handles tore out after only a couple of hours of use. The rest of the stitching looks just as weak and prone to tear. This is definitely NOT well built. I fully expect it to fall apart before the 2 year warranty is up. I don't know what many of the other reviewers are seeing when they remark about it being sturdy and well built. One reviewer even said ""It also has strong, sturdy handles..."". I think peoples perceptions about quality have been slowly eroding over the past 30 years or so. It's a good idea, poorly executed."
2,So disappointed,"I bought this container with high hopes as the reviews were great and my neighbor has had one for years. I used to have a soft bottom container and it eventually tore, which is understandable.I have used this container on and off throughout the spring and summer and was quite happy with it until yesterday when I went to move it (while it was empty) and one of the handles broke. I thought, ""Oh well, I can use the other side."" So I grabbed the other handle and it broke off, too! Unfortunately the container with no handles is useless so in the trash it goes.I wish I could return this and get another in hopes that it was just a fluke, but my return window is expired. Such is life."
3,Love Size but...,I was going back and forth on ordering this one or the Fiskars without the hard shell bottom and decided on this because I thought it would be sturdier. It actually causes it to cave-in on the sides for some reason. I have another brand/same size container but no hard base and never have that cave-in on the sides at all. When that happens it doesn't stand up right. Wish I had ordered the one without the hard shell base.
5,yard help,"The rigid base on this product is a great improvement over the soft bottom which gets destroyed by those who tend to drag it around, especially those who cannot lift easily."
4,Well constructed and good value - but could be 10% bigger,"easy to use, fold-able and stores well, solidly constructed, looks nice, color coordinated, robust, handles helpful,solid plastic base prevents rotting"
4,So much better than the standard Fiskars collapsible container.,"Picked up this hard shell base container after my old (5 years) Fiskars, without the hard shell bottom, gave up the ghost and the bottom. The hardshell bottom makes it very easy to drag around the yard. I would not advise dragging it across anything like rocks or pavement. Love the ability to collapse the bag so it can be hung up on the wall and takes up very little space. One thing they should improve however is the upper handle placements. When you have a bag inserted, if you pull on the handles, the bag will shift off the rim because the handles are placed right at the top of the rim, not like it shows in the picture.If you are trying to decide between this one and the one without the hard shell bottom, don't hesitate to spend the extra $ and get the hard shell. It'll last a lot longer and slides around easily."
2,Does not hold up well,"This is the second Fiskars product we have purchased, and the second that does not hold up well to the heat of a Texas summer, falling apart after less than a year's service - and light duty, occasional use at that. The stitching at the handles has come loose, the fabric has torn - not what I expect when purchasing something of this nature."
3,Not as Heavy-Duty as previous model,"The previous model I had from Fiskars was made from a much heavier grade of coated fabric material. This model has the bottom hard shell, which will help since the bottom was the first part to wear out on the previous model, but I am still skeptical about the lighter, thinner, less heavy duty material overall."
3,Hard shell bottom- great! Handles- NOT great..,"I own the Fiskars mower and multiple Fiskars hand tools, and appreciate them for their quality and ergonomic features. The 9413 container lacks both of those attributes.I ordered this container because of the hard shell base. I have similar containers from other manufacturers, but the bottom rims have become frayed. The hard shell base solves that problem.Unfortunately, that feature is overshadowed by the poorly designed handles. While other brands may have four handles (two on top, and two on the bottom), the 9413 has only 3 handles- two on top, one on the bottom. You won't care about that unless, like me, you need the help of a second person to lift the full container. Further, the handles are poorly secured, and flimsy. On the second use, the bottom handle got caught under the shell. The handle didn't just fray; it was torn apart.This product appears to have been rushed into production before sufficient testing to catch the handle issues."
5,Best lawn bags ever,"After I purchased two of these Fiskars lawn bags for my yard work, my husband was so impressed with their durability and light weight that he had me order two more for his lawn mower grass disposal. They're so much better than the brown paper bags from big box stores. The hard bottom base makes them extremely wear and tear resistant. Love 'em!Fiskars 9413 30-Gallon Hard Shell Base Kangaroo Gardening Container"
4,Very handy,"This container works great for holding my gardening clippings. It is lightweight, easy to carry, it seems durable, and it folds flat for easy storage. Basically, it does it exactly what I needed it to do. The only thing I would suggest for an improvement is some sort of little pocket/pouch at the top of it for storage of small gardening tools (i.e. clippers, etc)."
5,Awesome Bin,"This is a great container for yard work. Lightweight, but extremely durable. Perfect size as it doesn't get to heavy, but hold quite a bit. Folds up for day storage"
5,Great help in the garden,"I've just purchased this to replace my old one. It had a soft bottom, and I've used it so much that it has holes in it. Maybe this one will last forever! These are the greatest invention. They're light and easy to haul around. You can stuff things into them, as you would a big trash bag (except these don't break). In my experience, they've taken lots of punishment before they began to break down. That they collapse so easily is a bonus, but I've found that I often just leave them open in the shed -- they're light enough that you can just set them on top of your wheelbarrow or lawnmower. We have desert landscaping with lots and lots of plants (as well as desert trees), which means tons of pruning each spring. I do it all myself and I would be lost without these things. There's also a smaller size (but I don't think it comes with the hard bottom) that's great for smaller jobs."
4,Start reading for a living!,"A unique book to break into script and book reading for a living. A very useful tool for people who want to break into this business. A practical guide to the business of story analysis. With lots of ideas, resources and tips.Needs updating!By Thei Zervakiauthor of Globalize, Localize, Translate"
3,The Christian Book of Daughters and Dads,"is what the title of this should be. It's a pretty good book, the stories are indeed moving and it there are some good insights, but give me a break! How about some warning on this one for those of us who are not Christian?"
5,new england lighthouses,excellent review of all lighthouses in the area. photos superb. recommend it to anyone who loves lighthouses.
2,Fogged up too quickly,"The lenses are intercheable, either that or they just remove too easily, and they fogged up during a woodland/open terrain airsoft match, I had to take cover and stick my fingers in, that's when I realized the lenses came off too easily. It's a nightmarish safety issue, you're better off buying shooting glasses or a non-vented safety goggle from your hardware store that's ANSI rated or real eye-pro like a paintball mask."
3,Its cheap and it gets the job done,"you can't really get a lot for less than 8 dollars, but these goggles get the job done. I ordered these to see how low profile goggles will work for me, and if they worked well, i would invest money into the revision exoshield. However, these should only be used if you fall into the following criteria1. You don't wear glasses or use contacts. Obviously, you won't be able to wear glasses with these2. You have a ready supply of Revision Anti-Fog. These are the only anti-fog that prevents fogging on these. anti fog sprays and gels will not work.These are really good if you use binoculars when airsofting. bino's have really short eye reliefs, and these allow you to use binoculars for spotting purposes."
1,cheap,"I got this glasses to protect my kids from the softair BBs. tHe guns broke fast as we got them and so the kids wore these for ""swag"". Well their swag didn't last long because hte glasses came apart."
1,Not worth the money,"These goggles fog up VERY fast. They are a horrible dark tint that makes it very hard to see. Also, the clear part keeps coming out of the frame.These are horrible. Save your money and buy another pair.Would not recommend to a friend."
4,Good Fitting Goggles,"I generally prefer standard safety eyeglass specs for just airgun use but I found these to be comfortable, good fitting and glare reducing goggles - recommended"
2,Not worth the money,"These goggles are horrible. They fog up way too easily and the lenses scratch. Also, the lens actually fell out of the frame. I have resorted to using these as target practice with my airsoft guns."
3,Not great.,This was purchased for my 13 yr. old son. He found them to be okay. We should have invested a little more for something more substantial. He also found it annoying that the lenses would fog up.
3,I thought goggles were supposed to help you see,"Sure, they're thin and protective but they fog up no matter what you do. You're eyes may be safe from any average airsoft gun but you wont be able to see it to shoot back. i tried anifog but that just made it worse. If your looking for saftey goggles dont buy these."
2,Extremely Cheap Construction - Avoid These!,"First let me say that these are fairly inexpensive, so in part you get what you pay for. But beyond that these are exceptionally bad. It's been a while since I've ran into a product that is blatantly cheap and poorly engineered.Issues:- The lens pops out regularly. From taking them off/putting them on I found several times they didn't fit right because the lens was trying to jump out of the rubber.- FOG. These things fog up on command. In almost every skirmish I tried to use them they ended up be completely foggy.- Only for small noses. I know that sounds silly, but as a guy with a bigger nose I found that the bridge area on these was extremely small and made them sit funny on my face.- The tint is a bit too dark. Unless you're using these on a very sunny day I would wager that things will not be as easy to see if you like.Pros:- They don't talk back when you curse at them for being so crappy."
4,It works!,"These goggles are sweet! I was playing in the bright sun, with snow lying all about, and the dark tinting really kept the glare out of my eyes. They fit pretty weel, and the band is adjustable. I even put them on over my glasses one time! Worth the $10 if you play in brighter areas, and keeps your eyes safe too!"
1,Not safe googles,First off i purchesed these with my first airsoft guns witch i sould of done some more researchpro:none :(cons:there not clear googles so there is no chance you can play a night fightthe glassess come out of the rubberthey are to tight on your headI played with the googles once and havent played since plus they arnt safe they will pop out of the rubber while you play i had to call sevreal time outs with my friends i say dont waste your money on something that wont keep you say in a war
2,"eh, i dunno, i've seen better","the goggles came in a timely manner, however, my two greatest complaints are as follows.1: they fog WAY too easy. the fact that they seal in around your eyes mean that there's no air flow, and your eyes feel like they're cooking2: your's may be different, but on mine, the plastic lens fell out. i put in some rubber cement, and tied some string around the narrow bit, and they work just fine, but i highly reccomend testing yours out. nothing ruins a battle like your only protection self-destructing"
3,"Good book, but not Shermer's best.","Mike Shermer is at his best when he writes in his ""Saganesque"" style, explaining complex or controversial issues in a conversational manner. However, about one third of this book is a textbook style read, discussing evolutionary forces that drive ""moral"" behaviours, and though well painstakingly researched and well thought out, I thought it could be quite dull.The rest of The Science of Good and Evil is enjoyable, written more in the style of "" How we believe"" which I thought was an excellent book. A chapter on mental illness using attempted assassin John Hinckley was very interesting, and I particularly liked the chapter on being moral without believing in God, which was very well argued. Not Shermers best, but a quick book that is worth the time if you like the subject manner."
4,A Good Read,"I'm not sophisticated enough to tender a scholarly review of this book, but I know it's a good read. I enjoyed it throughly."
4,Good book about this subject!,"I haven't read any other books by Shermer, although I have another one on my wish list. I like the way he explains the ""science"" of good and evil (I'm not sure if I would call it a science). It gave me a new perspective on human beings and our behavior as another animal specie. And now I understand much more why some people act towards others the way they do, and why they behave as they do in society."
2,Interesting but more Opinion than Science,"Micheal Schermer's book is interesting but there is little science here and he fails to elaborate on many of his claims. It is difficult to call something science when almost of all of your claims are not based on the scientific method, but based on one's perspective. This is like twinkie science. I kept waiting for a claim that could be substianated beyond a reasonable doubt. Schermer doesn't try to explain many of claims pretending as if they were self-evident. Most of this book is based on a nuanced definition of the word transcend and the invention of a new word ""premoral"". Nevertheless, this was a brave try at trying to explain morality without a God, better than most, but at the end of the day this twinkie science is full of too many ""empty calories"" to be functional as an substantive explanation of good and evil."
4,excellent,"Shermer summarizes the consensus from various scientific disciplines. Since it can read like a textbook, it may be best to skip around to topics of interest. Great source for info and logical argument without being confrontational (offensive) towards religious readers."
5,Still a Favorite!,"I have owned this album since the day it came out and it is still one of my favorites (not just KANSAS albums)! It came out at a time when a fan like me seriously missed new music from great groups such as KANSAS, which could be why I enjoy it so much. I don't understand how anyone cannot like this album as a KANSAS fan. It takes you on a ride from the start with ""I Can Fly"" then brings you home with ""Peaceful and Warm"". I'm not sure what Steve Walsh was going through in his life but I think some raw emotion comes through with an ultimate expression hope. I'm not sure why some people do not like the song ""Need"". I still play that song at the highest volume that I can. There's something about it maybe it's the rhythm or the emotion. Of course, these are just my opinions.To those who love KANSAS and do not have this album, all I can say is that it is still one of my favorite albums!"
4,Underrated Effort,"Freaks of Nature is an underrated and probably under-listened to effort by the boys from Kansas. There is solid, energetic playing and some good material here that deserves several listens to appreciate it all. Steve Walsh's voice is in good form and David Ragsdale brings not only his own tasty style to the violin parts, but co-writes several of the fine tunes as well. Phil Ehart's drumming is just as tight and intense as ever, but also a little more thoughtful...some unexpected moments make the songs even more interesting. They really breathe new life into the Kansas sound with this one."
5,Rocking,"This is the most intense, rocking Kansas release since their 70s heyday. With ""Freaks of Nature,"" Kansas reunited with superproducer Jeff Glixman and reconciled with songwriter Kerry Livgren (who provides the excellent ""Cold Grey Morning""). While original members Robby Steinhardt, Livgren, and Dave Hope are still missing from the active lineup here, there is a lot of the ""old spirit"" infusing this album. David Ragsdale adds very nice flourishes on the violin which further enhances the old school Kansas feel.The songs are topnotch, especially the groovy/funky/scorching/proggy ""I Can Fly,"" the lovely ""Hope Once Again,"" the complex title track, and the epic ""Peaceful and Warm."" The song, ""Black Fathom Four"" raised the hair on my neck (in a good way).Far too few Kansas fans have ever heard this one, making it a lost masterpiece, in my opinion."
4,brilliant,"The past is gone so why try to compare this to those albums from the band's golden years. Throw away the first song and what remains here is great stuff. My favorite song here is Black Fathom with it's angry 'sign of the times' flavor. Other outstanding highlights are Under the Knife, Cold Grey Morning and Peaceful and Warm."
1,Far too small for its intended purpose!,"It's no accident that the product shot is shown open. It CANNOT be zipped closed with the amount of equipment and supplies shown; furthermore, the pockets are not expandable enough to be functional. We tried it with several different meters to the same result.Buyer beware. This is close to useless."
5,amazing story,"I was very touched by the story, is there anywhere to buy the movie? I'd love to see it."
4,A Great Perspective,"I read this book a few years ago for a history class at Ohio State. It is a wonderful book. The story is of an American woman (the author) who marries a Japanese diplomat just before World War Two. She goes with him when he is deported back to Japan for the duration. I liked how the book gave you the war through the eyes of someone on the Japanese homefront. The fact it is a true story really makes you feel for the family as they struggle to stay together and healthy. I got the same feel from this book as I did from ""All Quiet On The Western Front"" in that it gives the day to day Non-American perspective of a war we grow up learning about."
5,Robbie Nevil Rules!!,"I grew up listening to Robbie Nevil. My husband and I spent 5 months on vacation driving across the U.S. earlier this year listening to Robbie Nevil's ""Day 1"" CD. I thing my husband got sick of it, but I was in pure heaven listening to such great music. I can say I'm truly happy now that I have ""Wot's it to ya: the Best of Robbie Nevil"" and don't need any other artist's music. I'm just shocked that he didn't come out with more CDs or catch on with more people like Journey and the Eagles. ROBBIE NEVIL RULES!!!"
4,Fun little toy!,My six year old loves this! It's held up surprisingly well since he got it for Christmas. I only wish it came with more balloons. Ours both popped and its been difficult to find the right size.
2,Kind of disappointing,"I bought this as an add-on to the birthday gift for my 7 year-old brother. He was excited to get it and use it, but I am the one who has to blow up the balloons to make the helecopter go... which it doesn't. The balloon pulls the helecopter off-course, it doesn't actually fly, it kind of falls to the ground, it's really disappointing. I don't know what I expected exactly, but I know I expected it to at least whirl around and fly before crashing to the ground."
4,Easy to use and he loves it!,"What more can I say? Little boys love transportation toys and noise, so this whistling balloon helicopter is perfect for me to entertain our 2 year old."
3,I didn't exactly get what I paid for,"When I ordered this, I expected this book, however, I got a paperback version of it with a different cover and a different edition. Kinda false advertising. It still worked for class, but it wasn't what I was expecting to get."
3,Doesn't have to be a vampire book....,"I love reading vampire books, and I was looking for this for a long time. Over all it's a pretty good book. This is the story of a man who's turned into a vampire and he's hunting the woman to turned him. The problem is that this didnt' have to be a vampire book. It feels that the author wanted to write a book about a man seaching for someone, and the vampire aspect was just an after thought.The characters are pretty good. Mikaelian is a detective and is a beliveable chatacter. Lane Barber is a vampire and her character is good too.The writing style was pretty good too, it just that I was expecting more form the vampire perspective. More killings, and more violence.Over all it was a pretty good read. If you like vampire books, consider this vampire lite."
3,Barbie Was Just Okay,"This game is good for younger girls, but with so many more complicated games around, don't expect it to keep them entertained for very long."
4,awsome death/grind!!!!,"i bought demo of sepsism's back in the mid 90's and it blew me away.i thought they broke up or something,but they didn't.now after all these years i found on of there cds.it's killer!not as good as there demo i had,but it's pretty damn good."
2,A useful but deeply flawed biography.,"Blotner did a prodigious amount of research for this biography. Any later writer who wants to produce a biography of Faulkner will inevitably find himself or herself relying on much of Blotner's work. The reader, however, will not be so grateful. Blotner seems incapable of distinguishing between that which is important and that which is not. It seems as though he has dumped almost everything he learned into this book. And he learned quite a lot. Why we need, for example, to know the names of everyone Faulkner came into contact with? Finally, Blotner is not a gifted writer; his style is typical of the academic. I can only hope someone writes a shorter, more readable biography of Faulkner someday."
1,Crashing Into The Alphabets,I was very disappointed with this book. It is the product of a man with very sick fantasies.
3,The grass is singing,It was an old book with an old story. The book was not in very good condition but I knew that at the onset
5,This movie is great just like always.,"It still has the characters we love like Annie, Tesie, Kate, Molly,Duffy and Pepper that get through the ""Hard Knock""times at the orphanage. Carol Burnette is as funny as ever and is the number 1 Miss HAnagahn ive ever seen."
3,Could've been a contender.,"This movie had it made from the beginnings. A great Miss Hannigan to keep the audience laughing. A sensible Grace Farrel to put in a motherly touch. A bald Daddy Warbucks whose conservative oppinions and naive nature kept it real. Tim Curry and Burnadette Peters as the villains (who could ask for anything more?). The only thing wrong with this movie was the girl they got for Annie. What a cheesball! I think that this was a great movie. It had a great soundtrack and songs which would've been worth buying on their own if it weren't for that sharp, painfully flat voice of Annie's. Take out the old Annie and put in a new one that was not tone-deaf and voila!! You have a hit."
4,Good Musical,"Watched this with my 5 & 7 year old children. I agree that it may be a little claustrophobic due to the adaptation to TV format, but the music and story are still wonderful. My children enjoyed it as well. My only disappointment -- the few unnecessary words of profanity."
4,A great movie to start your kids love for Musicals!,"I have watch the musical and the movie, though there are differences, both are great productions! Be it the stage production or the screen version, both are fun. And absolutely a delight to watch. It doesn't have to be historically correct. Just sit back, relaxed and enjoy the movie!"
5,This is the Annie to buy.,"If you are looking for a version of Annie for your kids, get this one. We have three girls and we bought both this and the 1982 version with Carol Burnett. This one is so much better in every way. It is almost perfectly done, moves along at the right pace and is really entertaining. Get the sound track too. The music is wonderful.The Carol Burnett version is much less PC and not as appropriate for young children. Carol Burnett is too drunk and mean; the scenes where Annie is in danger are a bit too scary for young kids, and the dancing is of the manic 80's Flash Dance genre - comic today.Our girls have watched this Annie probably 100 times and they always love it. As do I. When my kids belt out the numbers, I get to play Rooster - and the Rooster in this version is so much fun - there's nothing better!"
1,WIDECREEN is a MUST,I have wanted this for years to come out in a special edition. I did not know until after I received it as a Valentines gift that it was FULLSCREEN! UGH!! I opened it already & am stuck with it now but would never have wanted it had I known it was 1:33.Why...WHY do studios do this??!!??
5,Annie's a Gas!!!,"Annie Special Anniversary Edition is an award-winning musical using award-winning actors and actresses. Carol Burnett gives a top-notch portrayal of a drunken, no-account keeper of the orphans. All of the children give great performances backed by excellent musical numbers. A must-see for anyone who is jaded by today's societal mores. The extras included with the movie are a nice cap to the main entertainment, which is the best escapism vehicle around today, in my opinion."
4,Certainly NOT charmless.,"Did the reviewer who wrote that this film is 'charmless' see the movie? It is a really great film, solid acting and a gorgeous voice from the little girl playing Annie. Needless to say Carol Burnett is outstanding and hilarious, and her duet with Daddy Warbucks is just great."
5,Annie DVD,"Thanks I've been looking in stores and could not fine this version, Daughter and I love. Was shipped very fast. Thanks"
5,Movie bought as a gift,Movie on our daughters Christmas list. Great movie I think this is the best remake of Anne and would recommend it for anyone who loves Anne.
1,There's Nothing Like a Broadway Show,"I'm sorry but I think that both of the Annie movies are just theatre wanna-be's. I respect the fact that they are trying to get stars into the films and everything, but don't you think that it would have been a lot better if someone from broadway was playing the roles. Like Idina Menzel, or Christian Chenowith...the best singers are really on broadway."
5,Da Bomb,This movie is SSo Awesome! Annie Is SSo COOL! I think everyone should at leest watch the whole movie Annie at leest once! The songs are so Cool/Awesome/The Best!
3,No wide screen is like a fake movie,"I think that the people who originally produced this wonderful movie deserve more respect for their effort. And the public in general deserve more respect for the money they spend in fakes like this. I bag to companies that produce DVDs with art like this one to use WIDE SCREEN formats with the best technology possible. In my opinion, it is a matter of justice and honesty. After all we are already well in the 21st century, (except, perhaps, in the minds of some people for whom ""money"" is the only art they know)."
1,A Travesty! Horrific! Painful!,"Don't misunderstand me. Annie, the Broadway stage musical, is a delight-charming, funny, thoroughly enjoyable. But this film is just about the worst film ever made from a good play. Whose idea was it to have the brilliant but macho John Huston direct a musical about children? The Maltese Falcon, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The African Queen, Prizzi's Honor... Annie???? Oh yeah, that makes sense. Carol Burnett, a brilliant comedienne, is completely unfunny here. The girls who play the orphans are loud, overbearing, and annoying in the extreme. Ann Reinking, Bernadette Peters, Tim Curry-all wasted. And every dance number is filled with flashes of little girls' underwear. Ewwwww! Only Albert Finney and Geoffrey Holder survive with the slightest shred of dignity. But even they cannot save this abomination."
4,I Thought This Was Great!,"Before I saw ths Disney version of Annie I saw the stage musical and then the movie that starred Albert Finney, Carol Burnette, Aileen Quinn, Bernadette Peters and Tim Curry and I thought it was a good movie with a great cast so I bought that movie on DVD but when I heard about the newer Disney adaptation I decided I wanted to see that one too so I bought this DVD and I personally think that the cast of Victor Garber, Alicia Morton, Alan Cumming, Audra McDonald, Kristin Chenoweth and Kathy Bates was great too and I highly recommend this version of Annie! My only complaint and this is with both versions of Annie is that they didn't use all of the songs from the original Broadway stage musical but that doesn't stop me from liking either movie!"
3,"A LITTLE BETTER THAN THE 1ST ANNIE, BUT...","Your kid will love this film. You, on the other hand, might find it a little lukewarm. This Disney version is definitely better than the original 1982 version--the production values are outstanding--but the casting is just plain awful! They can all sing beautifully, to be sure, but, boy--with Albert Finney, Tim Curry, Aileen Quinn, Carol Burnett and Bernadette Peters in the original--they had some pretty big shoes to fill. No one looks like who s/he's supposed to (the guy who plays Warbucks is a little on the young-ish side; Bates is perfect, though), and the little girl who plays Annie, though good, lacks the charisma and cutesiness factor of Quinn. Oh, well--maybe next time we'll get a perfect ""Annie"" remake that combines the cast from the Huston production with the production values of this one.Till then, this one will have to do."
4,Fine show,"If you want the story the way it is presented on the stage, this is not the version for you. You will need to get the new Disney version with Kathy Bates.This film is NOTHING like the Broadway show, its an entirely different animal. Aileen Quinn stars as Annie, with Carol Burnett as Miss Hannigan, Bernadette Peters as Lily St Regis, Ann Reinking as Grace Farrell, Albert Finney as Warbucks and Tim Curry as Rooster.The director, John Huston, has turned the show into a huge, bellowing blockbuster, with huge fanfares and leaping dancers. The show is really a simple tale of a girl in search of her parents, and who finds a home in the arms of a millionaire.The climax, with Annie dangling over a bridge thing, is completely unrealistic.Also, there is no real romance between Grace and Warbucks on stage, and yet here we are led to believe that by the end they are...!But, if you want Annie on hormones, buy this by all means, but buy the Disney version too for the real telling of the tale."
3,Good but Intoxicated,"Be aware that Miss Hannigan is a lascivious DRUNK in this rendition of Annie. Carol Burnett is hilarious, but you may find yourself explaining her actions to younger viewers."
5,Annie,Terrific movie with a great score and cast! Carol Burnett is perfect as Miss Hannigan! Outstanding entertainment for the whole family!
5,This movie Annie,"I bought this movie Annie for my kids. They loved it, great purchase!! It was at a very great price too and great quality made."
3,good movie but not in this format,"Our Daughter loves the movie but the aniversary edition on DVD is in fullscreen (pan and scan). when we got the newly released Blue Ray edition it was in original wide screen. My daughter who has watched the movie many times noticed right away. ""ive never noticed that before!"", the fact that you can see the person the actors are talking to in the foreground instead of just talking heads, and It really adds to the production value of the dance numbers. make the Bue ray version the one to get. It was never released in wide screen in DVD format. It was only released in wide screen on Laser Disk (If anyone remembers those). Also DO NOT ever buy ""Annie 2:a royal adventure"" Worst sequal ever!5 stars for the Movie: good family movie night again and again (for girls)2 stars for the DVD pan and scan format (get the blue ray for the intended wide screen format)"
3,Leapin' lizards!,"Well, I think this is a really swell movie. Albert Finney and Carol Burnett crack me up, Aileen Quinn is exactly what Annie should be, and Sandy is perfect.But WHY OH WHY is this not being offered in a widescreen format? I have yet to see all of ""It's a Hard Knock Life"" and I know those girls are knocking themselves out offscreen. I've seen this movie on three different media. All were pan and scan, and all three showed different parts of the picture! The worst was a VHS release. (...)I don't know which is more frustrating about this anniversary dvd, the fact that it doesn't offer widescreen, or the fact that the dvd menu and the special features show the movie clips in widescreen, teasing me with those brief glimpses.There is no reason that dvd manufacturers shouldn't at least OFFER a widescreen version. Let's get with the 21st century already!"
1,Still No Widescreen!,"I can't help but wonder if ALL the widescreen prints of this movie were destroyed in a warehouse fire. Why would you bother to master another ""Special Anniversary Edition"" with a new DTS soundtrack and not include a Wide screen version? Especially with more and more widescreen TVs on the market. It is going to look pretty silly in a few years showing this pan and scanned musical on your widescreen TV. While not my favorite movie musical, I would still buy it if they ever have the sense to release it in it's original format! Until then...forget it!"
1,Not letterboxed? You've got to be kidding.,"I was all set to purchase this disc Tuesday. I'm glad I checked this site because there is no way I'm buying a pan & scan-only version in the year 2004. I thought the reviewers must by mistaken, there is no way that this would be released full screen--one reason is that it's a musical with dancing! But every site I check lists this as full screen.I wouldn't have bought it full screen when I only had a 4x3 TV and I certainly won't buy it now that I have a 16x9. I'm sure the great majority of TV owners still have 4x3's and I bet this won't really turnaround until the end of the decade, but this is no excuse for the format of this release."
4,Great family movie.,"I was a little cynical when I first saw this movie as I'd seen the show done on stage and had been really disappointed with the last Annie produced in the 80's, but I was pleasantly surprised. I watched this with my four-year old daughter and she loved it. The acting was great. Kathy Bates, as usual, was wonderful. The little girl did a wonderful job as Annie and all the musical numbers were fun. This 1999 version lacked some of the stunts that made the previous movie unbelievable. It was sincere and stuck to the original play very well. My daughter loved it and after one viewing was mopping my kitchen floor singing ""Hard Knock Life."""
1,Dreadful!,One of the biggest bombs of the 80's. There are people still in a coma from watching this movie.
2,this cheesy remake,this 1999 version of annie isnt as good as the original because all the sets in the movie were fake you couldnt even see the roof of the mansion ive seen the original its much betterbut ive got to say annie has mostly had a makeover alicia morton does not have big curly hair like the original annie she has straight hair and you didnt even see all of the ofphan girls. When they were in bed there was only 5 or 6 of them but when they were going outside into the street there were 20 or something orphans this is not a good planned movie they cant even do one thing right
1,Not pleased at all!!!!!,"I was so excited about getting this movie at such a good deal on the price, because I love musicals. When we watched the movie, I was shocked to find that they used the Lords name in vein in this movie. I bought this movie for my nine year old child and when I received the movie I did not want to watch it much less let my nine year old. People selling these movies need to be more specific about the ratings...this movie is not a G rated movie in my opinion. I would buy more movies if they would leave the bad language out or edit them somehow."
3,"""Full Screen"" ...are you kidding?","What brilliant MBA at Columbia Tristar decided that the best way to bring out a ""Special Anniversary Edition"" was to put it in home TV format? It's not the way it was filmed, it's not the way it was shown in the theatres, so why in heaven's name is this not on the DVD (or do a 2-sided flip disk, with full screen on one side and wide screen on the other)? Only people who seriously like the film are going to be purchasing a new edition of the disk -- Columbia Tristar is making a serious mistake -- any desk clerk at a video store would know this is a stupid decision. The film is a good one, some would say great, some say not, but if you like the film - full screen is an insult. The home video screen industry is very rapidly changing into high definition, wide screen format -- a lot of stores are not even stocking traditional screens anymore. Columbia Tristar -- what were you thinking????!!!"
1,"Yes, everyone has said it...","But maybe if enough of us say it, the company will actually DO something about it! WHAT IS UP WITH NOT HAVING A WIDESCREEN VERSION!?!? I was definitely going to purchase this special edition until I saw it was only available in full screen. I'm just so glad that I got the previous release, since they were actually smart enough to add widescreen to that version. I'll skip the special features if I have to. By the way, I would have loved to seen the ""Lights, Camera, Annie!"" behind the scenes documentary that another reviewer posted about. Well, I hope they get it right when they release yet another version in a few years."
3,"Movie great, sound quality: not so good.","This movie is a classic and I just bought it for my 2.5yo daughter. She watches it it at least twice a day. I have one problem though, and it's a fairly large probelm that would make me tell others to ""pass"" on the Special Edition. The sound quality is bad. The singing parts are sooooo loud and the speaking parts are quiet. I'm adjusting the volume throughout the movie. Not good!!!"
4,Better on Broadway,"Having been lucky enough to see the original on Broadway I was looking forward to the transition to the silver screen. Unfortunately most of the magic of the musical was left in New York and never made it to Hollywood. The songs are, of course, very good, though they did drop one of my favorites, ""NYC"", from the score and added the, in my opinion, inferior ""Let's Go To The Movies"". Aileen Quinn does a very credible job in the title role. Albert Finney, as Daddy Warbucks, and Carol Burnett, as Miss Hannigan, also do a good job. Ann Reinking, as Daddy Warbucks' secretary, proves to be one of the best dancers around. Many of the things that are done in the movie, such as the rescue of Annie on the railroad bridge, could not have done on the stage. For all its shortcomings, ""Annie"" is still well worth the watch."
2,Not impressed,"I didn't care for this version at ALL. The bright spots were Andrea McArdle, Kristen Chenowith and Alan Cummings! But the orphans were dull and underused, Kathy Bates was NOT mean enough and Victor Garber wasn't gruff as Warbucks is supposed to be. Alicia Morton has a sweet enough voice, but she is NOT Annie material...she doesn't belt like Andrea McArdle or the other Broadway Annies I've seen! There's no power in her voice at all. Overall I was tremendously disappointed, and the ending was so awful I cringe just thinking about it."
3,Good...not great...good,"Who cares if her hair wasn't curly? Alicia Morton was terrific (besides, it was curly at the end). Aileen Quinn was cute too, but a little on the phony side. I am a DIE HARD Kathy Bates fan, but I don't think she quite beat Carol Burnett here. Here is my biggest beef: It did not show the relationship develop between Warbucks and Annie like the 1982 version did. He brushes her off, and the very next day wants to adopt her? I'm glad they took out all of the hanging-off-the-bridge stuff. They added more African-Americans to the cast which was great. It was neither better nor worse, just different!"
1,"If You Love The Original, Don't Get This!","I was very disappointed in the Disney company trying to remake a classic story. I tried to watch this but it came no where close to being an o.k. version of the original. I didn't like the new Annie, new Mr. Warbucks, and esp. didn't like the new Miss Hannigan. Kathy Bates is a wonderful actress, but she's no Miss Hannigan. If you loved the original and don't like remakes of classic films, don't get this."
2,I'm suspicious....,"While this movie was cute well, movie-wise, I'm suspicious of the fact that the orphans were made up of what seemed like EVERY major ethnic type! ...""I'm not saying that the girls in the movie were not good or even that some of them should not have been cast anyway, I'm just, well, suspicious. ... ( However, Audra MacDonald as Warbucks' secretary Grace Farrell did make sense to me despite the fact that it didn't to some people. (due to the fact that the story was set in the 1930's, and Ms. MacDonald is black) Oliver Warbucks always seemed like the kind of man who Did What He Wanted To Do No Matter What Anyone Thought, ..."
2,Filmed Stage Show,"This film looked as though it was filmed at the Theatre. It is a very subdued version of Annie. Kathy Bates' Miss Hannigan is much too nice, Bring back Carol Burnett! Although the 80's film had its faults it has grown on me over the years. This film looked very dull beside it."
4,A Classic from My Childhood!,"Annie was one of my favorite musicals when I was little, and I was thrilled to purchase this DVD for my own daughters. We've watched it twice this week, and it's sure to be a family favorite. The cast is wonderful and the extra features are fun. I'd forgotten about the sexual undertones of Ms Hannigan, so I had a bit of explaining to do to my kids but overall it was a fantastic purchase."
5,Just as good as......,"It's just as good as when I first saw it when it came out. And my girls love it now. An great classic, and Carol Burnette is perfect in it!"
1,Very Poor Quality,"I am a music teacher and I show musicals to my students. We have watched some of the best...Music Man, Oliver, Mary Poppins, so I thought that Annie would be a great addition to the repertoire. Well, this video is an embarrassment to the musical. The acting is very poor, the sound track and the mouth do not match up periodically. It looks like a poorly made version. I do not recommend this video. I'm sure there are better versions out there. Read carefully."
4,"The sun will come out tomorrow, now that I've got Annie!","I recently seen what Alieen Quinn looks like after all these years, she is in this special edition DVD with karaoke, documentary, fun history trivia about the 1920's-1930's (Annie's era.) Even though she has red hair in the movie, Alieen Quinn never had red hair in real life, that was just a wig! Carol Burnett won Academy award for best actress as Miss Hannigan, she doesn't really hate children. She took Alieen Quinn under her wing on the set. Albert Finney recalls having to shave his head for the part of Daddy Warbucks, he said it was a bit drafty, (J/k) any way Tim Curry plays Miss Hannigan's sleezy brother, Rooster! Then there's Miss Grace, Punjab, & good ol' Sandy! A musical with brightful cheeryness that makes you wanna sing The sun will come out tomorrow again and again, just as long as nobody can hear you, if people are around, allow your heart to sing it for you! Hope this review helped!JM."
5,Brings back memories,"This was a gift for my 23 year old daughter. She must have watched Annie a million times as she grew up. Thank heavens it was usually with her grandmother:) When she opened it on Christmas morning, she saw only the back of the cover but let out a shout of glee as she realized that it was ""Annie"". I would recommend this movie if you like musicals and love to sing along. We all belt out ""Tomorrow"" each time we watch."
5,Great movie,Such an excellent movie. I am going to watch it over and over again. It's a great watch with the hubby.
3,"JOHN HUSTON, OPUS 35","It's pointless to look for a Hustonian thematic map with Annie, the man had to pay his taxes too after all. So what's left? A musical with fine moments, a half Pippi Longstoching half Shirley Temple character who sings and dances correctly, some catchy songs that linger in the head and the performance of Albert Finney and Carol Burnett. Recommended to Huston completists or to parents looking for a rainy sunday afternoon family movie.Final note: if you're looking for a widescreen version of ANNIE and if you own a multi-zone DVD player, you'll have to visit the British branch of this site in order to find it."
4,Loss of charm from Broadway version,"Annie is a great film, I especially enjoyed Carol Burnette, Bernadette Peters, and Tim Curry's performances. However, I find the stage version better because it more thoroughly explains the plot and setting."
2,No cigar.,"This film just doesn't compare to the original film. I liked that they included NYC, but the cast struck me as lackluster. When I heard Kathy Bates I was excited, but she pailed in comparison to Carrol Burnette. If you want your kids to see the story of Annie I reccomend finding a stage show."
3,"Not a huge fan of Annie, but there are exceptions","I'm not a huge fan of Annie in general... something about annoying ten-year-olds. This goes for all versions. (In my day, I could have been Annie, but that's a different story). And I don't like the song ""Tommorow"" so there you go. I happen to like this film version for oh... four reasons. Burnett, Curry, Reinking, and Peters. There's a lot of talk comparing the 1999 and 1982 version, but for me, I like the darkness and the characterization of '82. I would have liked to seen ""NYC"" in this movie instead of ""Let's Go See the Movies"". And of course, neither Annie really impressed me. But that's why I gave it a three."
2,Not for children,"I can't believe some of the glowing reviews people have written on here when they have watched it with their young children. I overlooked the blatantly sexual innuendo by Carol Burnett's character, because my 5 year old has no idea what's going on there. But there were at least two ""D*mn""s and two loud-and-clear ""G#ddamm#ts"" I knew this movie was PG, but it's Annie for goodness sakes! And fellow reviews on here had given it a thumbs up after watching with their children. Please!"
2,Annie Review (1999),I feel that this movie was not as good as the origional because there were some conflicting points. If you see the origional and then see this you will be wishing for the origional once again. This version in my opinion could have been a lot better or at least similar to the first. The only similarities were the names of the characters and the plot.
5,Movie vs. play? Not good vs. Bad simply different!,If you're looking at this movie from an adult perspective and comparing it to the musical show - you probably will notlike it. If you look at it as an adaptation targeted at children (and the children at heart) you'll probably love! I think that's the reason why the reviews describe it as either fantastic or terrible (beauty is definitely in the eye - and heart - of the beholder! I first saw it as a kid - way before I even knew there was a stage original and loved it - I loved the play as well (years later) but ther're not the same thing. Both are great in their own way.
5,One of the Best Movies Ever!,This movie was a lot better than the first one.I wish I could have been in the cast!
1,very disappointing,"I have not seen the broadway show, but I've seen both movies. I was VERY disappointed with this version. It is much too candy coated. Alan Cummings is the only saving grace in this version. Kathy Bates was HORRIBLE as Miss Hannigan. Carol Burnett and Albert Finney win hands down! Bernadette Peters and Tim Curry are great villains, and I love Punjab! Aileen Quinn is a much better Annie. Don't waste your money on this one!!!"
5,annie movie,fast shipment. purchased for sister's 30 th birthday as this move was released in 1982. haven't watched movie so not sure about quality of film
2,Love the movie with crummy transfer,"I can't complain much, however, the Laserdisc was pan and scan, the DVD was pan and scan and later on released in letterbox. Yet another favourite available in proper aspect ratio albeit the nothing-special transfer"
3,Five Stars for Little Girls,"I bought it for my 4 year old daughter and she's thrilled with it. The extra short featuring Aileen Quinn's recollections was charming. I like the casting, especially Finney and Quinn. As for the movie, I think most adults will find it kind of pokey. Wish it was a widescreen version."
1,Not Widescreen!!,Columbia Tristar you are a loser!! You took a great film like Annie (1982) and shortage all of us with 1.33:1 . This is an OUTRAGE. Why this is even called a Spedical Edition. Lucky I already own the widescreen version.
1,WIDESCREEN!!! GET WITH THE PROGRAM COLUMBIA!!!,"Fantastic film, but the existing version is much better even w/othe lovely DTS. It's all about the widescreen factor- In this dayand age the average film airhead obviously will still settle for Pan & scan for Columbia to release this 2MPH edition. Clueless mothers probably still complaining about ""THOSE DARNED BLACK BARS THAT CUT OFF THE TOP AND BOTTOM."" Not even so much as digging around the vaults to find an outtake or gag reel? Could've used the original poster for the sleeve! Betterbring a book for this release..."
3,No Widescreen?,"The movie is great (loved it since I was a very little girl when it first came out) and the special features are well chosen (except the stupid video by ""Play"" of ""Hard Knock Life"" -- what a waste).What I was really disappointed with is NO WIDESCREEN. I've seen others complain, and I'm adding mine to get another voice in on the desire for a widescreen version. This movie is so much better when viewed in its original form.Other than that, it's great."
1,Still no widescreen????,"I grew up in the 1980s loving this movie, I wore out my VHS copy of it. Being a film lover I have now moved on to DVD and I'm very disappointed that this film is STILL not being offered in widescreen. They bothered to add a DTS soundtrack but still no widescreen??? Some of us like to watch movies as the director intended, not hacked apart in the full-screen editions. So I still will not be buying this film, even though it is one of my all time favorites, until it is released in widescreen."
1,Not like the Broadway production,"This 1982 movie version is far from the 1977 musical and Broadway classic. If you want to see a version with songs and plot line more true to the Broadway musical, buy (or rent) the 1999 version produced by Disney."
1,When will we get a PROPER Widescreen release?,"Were all (actual) widescreen prints destroyed or something? I'm not a big fan of this movie, in fact I much prefer the 1999 version that actually adapts the musical. But when I saw this for the first time it was in Pan and Scan and yet during A Hard Knock Life you could see the kids knocking themselves out clearly. Here they zoomed in on the picture so that they knock themselves out offscreen. And this has the worst pan and scan job ever too- half the time we only see the characters' noses."
3,Not buying until available in widescreen,"I watched the 1982 version of ""Annie"" on TCM the other day. I hadn't seen it since I saw it -and hated it--in a theater. My expectations must have been low, because I actually enjoyed it, especially the performances. Carol Burnett is at her best in this. She's like a Disney villain come to life. Awesome. Albert Finney, Ann Reinking and Bernadette Peters were good, too. The worst thing was the direction. John Huston made some really odd choices and the ""action"" scene at the end was just about the worst action scene ever. The second worst thing: the children. They were all really phony. Aileen Quinn in the lead role was good in places and was musically talented (her tap-dancing was especially good), but her acting overall was pretty weak. I'm surprised to find that you can't buy this in widescreen. I'm not buying it until it is available in widescreen--and it probably will be eventually."
4,"Cute, just like the first one.","very cute. annie was a very good singer for however young she is, just like the first one. it's a great musical and the character's voices blend well together."
3,Why shucks! Not the only ginger hair ball on DVD!,"A great film, for its time, but never near what 'Annie' is meant to be.Don't get me wrong, I loved this little ginger fuzz ball for years but sadly the film is inferior to both the true Broadway intention and a more recent Buena Vista / Disney re-make. The latter is much more true to Broadway grandeur and razzmatazz which, in my opinion, could well leave this little orphan waiting for a `tomorrow' which will never come."
1,UnNecessary Repeat,"Who's idea was it to have Victor Garber as Daddy Warbucks? Okay he is a good actor, but once they had shaved his head, did they not see how freakishly Enormal it was? or the shine? THe original Annie was awesome, it was perfect, it didnt need a cheesy remake in the 90's.The new Annie doesnt even fit the bill, no red curly hair, which wasnt the original movies idea, it was based on the cartoon. My niece saw this one first, and then the original, and she LOVES the original even though she saw it second, she said the new one isnt ""as fun to watch"" and i agree!"
1,Horrible,An epic disaster. Bad acting. Poorly sung. The cast are all acting in different movies. Get the Disney tv version which is superior to this film in every way.
1,"A ""special"" edition that's not widescreen?","I was very much looking forward to adding this to my collection, since I remember my parents taking me when I was a child and loving it. I thought for sure this special edition would be a great addition to my collection.WRONG!It's not in widescreen! Does the late (and great) John Huston, who shot this film in 2.35:1, deserve to have the special edition of his film chopped up to Pan & Scan? For those who say you only lose a little off the sides, consider this: for 2.35:1 films like ""Annie"", you lose about 40% of the original picture. 40% in my opinion is much more than a ""little bit."" Imagine having 40% of your family portrait chopped off!If you really love this movie (and many do, including me), you should let Columbia know that you want (and deserve) an anamorphic widescreen presentation (which means enhanced for widescreen TVs) in its original aspect ratio (OAR) of 2.35:1."
4,Loved it as a youngster.....but watch out!!!,"Loved, loved, loved this movie when it was first released in the early 80's, which is precisely why I purchased it, along with the soundtrack for my 3yo. She loves it, too, and at this stage in her life is totally oblivious to the druken/sexual Miss Hannagin (now that I think of it, I was too, even at 13). Why, oh why did they feel the need to have actors screaming GD several times at the end?? This makes me sick they had to cheapen a precious musical with very talented actors. Otherwise it is a classic in my book. Oh, and I agree with others...much peripherial action is sadly lost due to the fullscreen rather than widescreen format."
2,mom2two,"The 1982 version of this movie is much better. This version just seemed too politically correct. Some of the original music was left out. Mrs Hannigan (Kathy Bates) was actually civil to the children instead of nasty. I loved Carol Burnett's character. Daddy Warbucks just wasn't the same, too nice. I liked the the original pompous Daddy Warbucks much better. The ending was completely different. It just seemed like everything was too nicey nicey."
3,You Get What You Pay For,"I received exactly what I ordered - Annie on DVD - the disc was ""used"", which definitely shows on the disc itself. Skips only in the menu, so we're able to watch the movie (which is good); other than the skipping, it was a very smoothe transaction :)"
3,Annie taps her way into a little girl's heart,"Neither the best nor the worst musical in film history, but solid performances by all stars and truly stunning talent amongst the ""orphans,"" especially Aileen Quinn as Annie and the little darling who played ""Molly."" Carol Burnett is a standout as Miss Hannigan as is Albert Finney as ""Daddy Warbucks."" Cannot overlook the supporting cast, especially Geoffrey Holder as Punjab. My young granddaughters love this movie and watch it over and over again. By now they can recite all the dialogue and sing along with every musical number. It's a huge success at my house! ""Annie"" gets a special thumbs up from my 2 year old granddaughter who sings and dances her way through every number and begs to watch the DVD over and over again when she comes to visit me. It's her absolute favorite movie, one she watches over and over again and never gets tired of it!!"
4,Classic,"Granddaughter loved most of the movie (the only part she didn't like was when one character said he was going to ""kill"" some of the little kids - she said it scared her). But the music is fantastic and it is a classic."
5,Great!,"My daughter, age 18, screemed when she pulled this out of her xmas stocking. It was her favorite xmas gift!!!! She had one years ago, loaned it to a friend, and never got it back, so it was like finding a lost treasure."
5,"Great Movie - Great interview with ""Annie""",I've always loved this movie. The anniversary edition is great with a super presentation by the lady that played the part of Annie.Carol Burnett and Annie steal the show but the entire cast is great.You'll love it too!
4,Great movie but someone was out of their Fullscreen minds!,I think whoever put this DVD together hates the movie and wanted to torture us with a Fullscreen version just for yuks. All menu and DVD extras (including the 3 sing-alongs) show it in Widescreen but the main movie is in Fullscreen. Why? It's nuts.Hey I don't know if this has been discussed over the years or not but Albert Finney's Daddy Warbucks voice is an impersonation of director John Huston's. It sounds just like him! Close your eyes during his dialog (especially near the beginning when he's more curmudgeon-like) and check it out.Everything is great about this DVD except that freaking Fullscreen treatment. WHY DID THEY DO THAT ANYWAY???
2,"Not ""Tomorrow"" ..... Today!!!","If you haven't already seen this one, do not wait until ""Tomorrow"", do it today.This is one of the most delightful musicals of recent years. Great performances by Aileen Quinn as Annie, Albert Finney as Daddy Warbucks, Carol Burnett is outstanding as Ms Hannigan and Tim Curry & Bernadette Peters make convincing nasties. The music is great and the easy-to-miss one-liners are delightful. All-in-all, a must see, and a must-possess movie."
3,Dissappointing,"For a Disney movie this is a real dissapointment. It was tacky, and very superficial. Of course Annie has to have curly hair! That's what made the original Annie special and gave it its trademark. Disney had a good story to work with and the music is great but unfortunately they couldn't capture the things that made Carol Burnett's Annie so wonderful. Don't get me wrong my daughter loves this movie, but then she hasn't seen the original. If you want to buy Annie, buy the original."
2,We thought this was horrible!,"I am more partial to the 1982 version. It was fun the acting was sooo much better and my daughter LOVES it. The 1999 version had poor acting, plus they rearranged the plot. I never saw the broadway musical, but...How can they mess with what we all remember as Annie? The ""new"" Annie didn't even have curly hair! Maybe I didn't like it because I already loved the first one, but no one I know has even liked the new one. I would say that if you liked the 1982 version you will probably NOT like this one."
1,Worse than Michael Jacksons Thriller! Worst musical ever!,Just 2 movies in my life scared the crap out of me and traumatized me for life. Michael Jacksons Thriller was one. Annie was the other. And man do I ever suffer. I grind my teeth and go insane every time I think about how bad this movie and it's soundtrack are. I hate it so bad I would rather go to a Barbra Streisand concert or see all 9 hours of Anne of Greene Gables and those evil PBS fund raisers in between than suffer the sheer torture of Annie. The sun will not come out tomorrow until this movie is destroyed from of the face of the planet. Or when the sequel Freddie vs Annie comes out where Freddie Kruger give Annie her worst nightmare forcing her to watch her own movie!
5,annie for all ages,"while i don't own this dvd yet (i'm treating myself tonite for my upcoming birthday)....i adore it...tim curry's hottest gig since ""rocky horror picture show""...and carol burnett..i can't say enough...the love to hate lush ms hannigan!!!!!!!!!! nobody could possibly do..""little girls"" like her....it's as much as classic/must own in my eyes as ""gone with the wind"" or ""the wizard of oz"".....if you don't wanna buy it, rent it or catch it on tv (with the annoying commericals)but you gotta see it!!"
3,Not Really Bad!,"Annie is a good musical, yet not excellent. It has a good cast, good songs and singing and such fun to watch. Annie is a story of a little adorable orphan searching for her parents. Her adventures stretch from being in a horrid orphange to being taken in by the richest man in the world, Oliver Warbucks. Mostly what the story is about is a man trying to get a daughter and an orphan trying to get a family.Carol Burnett is the most hilarious Miss Hannigan. Aileen Quinn is so cute as the little Annie. Albert Finney is pretty darn good as Oliver. And Tim Curry is stupendous as Rooster. Enjoy all the silly fun as you witness the story of love and forgivness. Thanks for reading."
3,What is Hollywood's problem?,"If you saw the Broadway version you be blown over. Then along comes Hollywood thinking that they can out do Broadway and they seem to screw it up every time. The cast is very good but why change some of the lead songs? Why add scenes like ""lets go to the movies"" which was filmed at Radio City Music Hall,,,,a place i love and have worked and admire,,,but there was no need to add that into the film version. Basically why does Hollywood think that they can create a better version than Broadway? They were way off the mark. Save your money, wait till it comes to your local summer live theatre. Remember i love musicals and have been in countless numbers of them but trust me on this one, the movie stinks."
2,Good Story,"I saw the 1999 Annie version by Disney before this one. I loved that one a lot. This one just seems to be charmless. I still love the story, but this movie did not seem to good. It was slow and at times very dull. Only some of the singing was good. Nothing amazing and crisp like in an Annie play on stage. The Annie verson from 1999 was a ton better. Everyone looked a little more civilized and they brought the song Tommarrow back and made it Annie's song again. In this version it is thrown in the back of things and does not make it her signature song. I would not recommand this version, but if you want to see a great version buy the 1999 one."
4,A different take on Annie...,"As I read the other reviews of this musical, I was a little bit upset. Okay so maybe Annie didn't have red hair, and maybe they plot did change a lot, but there were a lot of really good points to this musical. First of all this musical wasn't based on the 1982 version of Annie, it was based on the broadway production of it. And yes, in the broadway production of Annie they did cut a lot of the really cool numbers, but they added a lot of really nice ones too. So if you are expecting the 1982 version then I am sorry to say that you will be disppointed, but this version of Annie is a really good version, and you will be pleasently surprised. All of the actors and singers were great, and it was great to see a different and original version of Annie. A must have if you own the other version of Annie."
5,one of my favorites and my daughters' favorites too,"I do not know why so many people are downing this movie. True, I have never seen the Broadway production, but I HAVE seen Disney's production, and for me nobody will ever be Annie but Aileen Quinn. Carol Burnett was an excellent Miss Hannigan (I just couldn't get into Kathy Bates playing the role), and Ann Reinking was by far a better choice for Grace (I'm sorry but in the 1930s the likelihood of Grace being a woman of color are slim, and Daddy Warbucks giving her an engagement ring even slimmer -- PLEASE!!). I love this movie and so do my children, especially my daughter Lauren who always asks whenever they want to watch a movie, ""Annie!! Please, can I watch Annie?"" This movie rocks!!"
1,\annie,"I don't have much to comment on this item as i could not view it. When I put it in the DVD player it asks you to check your area code. There is no area code for you to check, so therefor I cannot view the film.My children were very dissappointed when they could not watch it and it was a waste of money buying it and having it shipped over,"
5,Did not get it !!!!,"I ordered this and another dvd at the same time. I received other dvd very soon after order. I never received ""Annie""; however, Amazon has assured me they have tracked down the problem and will credit my account. I am still waiting on the final say so on this. Probably would not order from this seller again, but I trust Amazon. As for the movie itself, it is wonderful. I wanted in my collection of classics and for my grandchildren. Too bad it did not arrive."
5,Annie....for the next generation,"I bought this movie for my 5 year old daughter, as she is too old for Princesses and too young for some of the other stuff out there. She LOVES it, and will be getting the CD for Christmas"
4,This Is The Best Version By Far,"The Amazon.com reviewer could not be more wrong, in my opinion. The terrific cast makes this version far superior to the 1999 version. There is just no comparison. The 1999 version is flat and boring; this version is full of life. Carol Burnett and Bernadette Peters are especially good. Go ahead and ignore the Amazon reviewer, buy this movie, it's lots of fun."
2,A children's movie that is not fit for children,"This movie is just plain icky. Carol Burnett's character drinks constantly, is in her underwear most of the time, makes sexual advances to Daddy Warbucks, and does a burlesque dance with Bernadette Peters and Tim Curry. It was embarrassing to watch with 12-year-olds. I wouldn't show it to younger children.The story is good. The visit with F.D.R. is interesting. Maybe the newer version made in 1999 is more appropriate for children."
5,Annie CD,"I am waiting to see this CD of Annie with my grandaughter who lives far from me, am holding onto it for our next visit. But it has arrived, as ordered, in fine condition, and I'm glad to have it."
5,drama club,"Our school is performing Annie this year in drama club. My boys aren't in the play but wanted to see the movie before hand. They sat thru the whole movie. Now they sing ""it's a hard knock life"". Very amusing"
3,Why isn't this a better film?,"This movie has a slam-dunk cast--Albert Finney as Daddy Warbucks. Carol Burnett as Miss Hannigan. Tim Curry as Rooster. Bernadette Peters as Lily. The original Broadway show has a ton of great, catchy tunes and a pretty tight book. And yet, this adaptation just doesn't work. I know it's difficult to transfer a stage play to film, but Annie would seem to be easier than most, as it already has a big cast and multiple settings. This just isn't a very compelling movie for three reasons: 1) They added songs and took out others. The new songs don't have the ""oomph"" of the original show tunes. In a word, they're boring. 2) John Huston's direction drags, drags, drags. 3) I'm going to say it--Aileen Quinn just didn't have the spark Annie needs. She has no edge, no genuine spunk. Mostof her line delivery sounds contrived. Watch this with a little kid--you'll enjoy it more because she/he will. But if you're a fan of musicals, don't bother with this adaptation."
1,Rubbish,"A textbook example of how to ruin a successfull stage musical by translating it to the screen. Pad out the plot to inordinate length, replace some of the best songs with third rate ones, add all sorts of unnecessary embellishments to the plot, etc. Pass on this, and go for the 1999 Disney version, which is far superior."
4,Annie,"This version of Annie is wonderful. Carol Burnett creates such a wonderful character, and the orphans are extremely talented. This film is a step above the rest of the ""Annie"" movies."
5,A Great Fresh Version of The Broadway Show!,"Wow! It was great! The acting was descent. The singing was superb. And who can forget the music. Annie is an orphan who has been treated bad her whole life. But now, A billionair, Oliver Warbucks, Is inviting an orphan to stay with him for a week for publicity. And that lucky orphan is Annie. But when Ms. Hennigan, the owner of the orphanige, gets jealus, her and her brother, Rooster, discuise themselves as Annie's parents that gave her up for reward money. Now Warbucks has to save the child he's grown to love before it's to late. Youre whole family will love it. Buy it today or tomorrow!"
1,Good Movie but the DVD Bites!,The movie is awesome and I totally love it!Hate the DVD. It's only fullframe and doesn't have widescreen and that blows!
1,Annie (special anniversary edition?) DVD,"I maybe ridiculed for this but, I don't even own this editon. Reason: NOT IN WIDESCREEN !!! NEEDS TO BE IN ORIGINAL FORMATT!!!Annie deserves widescreen!!! - 2.35:1 !!!Fan,Lance Lust"
1,Great Film What was Columbia Pictures thinking with this Poor DVD Release?!,I still own the original DVD release for this film which sports the great panavision 2.20:1 aspect ratio... how can you offer a new and better special edition of a film like this and use a Pan/Scan version beefed up by new audio tracks? Who ever was responsible for this should have been fired immediatly nbo questions asked they obviously have no love for the original aspect ratio of any film let alone Annie. What a waste of a release and time and effort.
1,Wait for the Widescreen Version,"This would have been a nice DVD except they made the unforgivable mistake of releasing the ""special edition"" in pan and scan. My family really likes this movie, but we won't buy it on DVD until the studio comes to its senses and re-releases it in widescreen."
5,A favorite in our house!,Our son loves this book! The illustrations are simple and clear. The text is cute and easy for small children to follow. I highly recommend this book for small children.
4,One of my favorite classic childrens books!,"Clifford The Big Red Dog was one of my favorite books when I was little it was one of the books my parens would have to read to me at bedtime, I still have the book too but is not in the best condition because when I was little I ripped the cover and scribbled all over the book, I'm thinking of buying this wonderful classic childrens book for my niece and since she loves dogs I'm sure she will love this book just as much as I did!"
4,Clifford... well...,"Frankly, I can take it or leave it. My nieces love Clifford, so I've added a star to my review and gone with the ""take it"" option. And if you or your kids like Clifford, you can rest assured that the entire series is inexpensive.The original book, at least, is simply written. That's something."
5,Great for Beginning Readers,Clifford The Big Red Dog is the most wonderful book I've ever read because its easy to read. The part I most liked is when they take Clifford to the island in a trailer. I think that ever child should read this book some times in their life.
2,Overpriced,Although the quality of the Clifford plush was satisfactory I thought it was overpriced for the size I recieved.I was expecting a bigger dog for the dollar. Next time I won't buy a stuffed animal online unless they indicate the size.
3,Clifford,I ordered this book for my 21 month old because she loves to watch Clifford the Big Red Dog on TV and she loves books. She really doesnt pick this book as much as I thought she would. I think because its not really illustrated too good and the people are different than on the TV show.
3,"We Never Quite ""Got"" Clifford","I guess some children love Clifford stories but when I read this to my favorite four-year-old he wasn't that interested and simply said, ""I'm glad I don't have to clean up after Clifford.""I think he had a point. How does Emily Elizabeth stay cheerful with all the cleanup a forty-foot dog necessitates? And for that matter, how does the family on the island keep Clifford fed? By the dump truck load? I know these aren't the sorts of questions that are supposed to go hand in hand with a fantasy but if a four year old catches on to them just like that, maybe they're fair game. Shrug."
4,Clifford the Big Red dog: Welcome to Birdwell Island,"Clifford is one of the more famous dogs of all time. He's big, he's red, and for some reason there is always trouble. In the book ""Welcome to birdwell Island"", you see that the yard and area that Clifford is living in is much too small for him, so his family decides to move to birdwell island, so that their favorite big red dog has room to run and play. At first the people pf Birdwell Island don't like Clifford because he is so big. So our favorite red dog is sad. Well the of course trouble happens and the forest catchs on fire, there is no way for the fire cheif to put the fire out. Well that is all I am going to tell you because I think you should read this book! On my book rating scale I would give this book an 8 1/2 for little kids. It is am excellent book for the younger community."
2,Not in new condition,When I received this book it had an ink mark on the front. The outer edges and corners were slightly worn. It was ordered as a new book.
5,A valuable Book with a long sought solution.,"""Improve Your Ability To Speak English"" has focused on the single greatest cause for mistakes in the English language by the average American, and that is ""ignorance of case."" Whether to use who/whom, he/him, they/them, ""between you and me"" vis a vis ""between you and I"" all depend upon understanding the difference between ""subjective case"" and ""objective case."" Sino Chika teaches us how to do this without having to relearn grammar. He uses the mistakes of politicians, TV news reporters, actors and actresses, to illustrate the kinds of mistakes made and demonstrates remarkably simple methods for correcting them. Helpful chapters on the misuse of the expression ""Aren't I..."" and on the proper pronunciation of commonly mispronounced words, make the book invaluable to anyone wishing to avoid sounding stupid!"
2,figure it out yourself,I'm just glad the book was not expensive...use your own common sense and save a penny
3,Not what I expected,"This book, in my opinion, is more of a social illustration of the deaf dog rather than an aid to living with and training a deaf dog.Realistically, training a deaf dog is no different than a hearing dog, except you must use hand signals and you have to find an alternate way to get their attention.I think what the author was trying to do is great, but, except for some statistics and research articles, it was not very helpful to me in our daily life.In one particular case, the author's advice is downright dangerous if you are not an experienced dog handler. DO NOT EVER attempt ""Alpha"" rolls if you have a deaf and or aggressive dog!!!!!!DO NOT hit your dog with a newspaper!DO NOT hit your dog with your hands or anything else!Just a word of caution....."
5,All dog lovers should read this.,"The unusual behavior pointed out in this book described my dog exactly. Since reading it, we have adopted a rescue puppy to be her hearing ear dog. Great book for any dog lover."
5,A life saver,"I was freaking out when I found out my new baby(pup) is deaf. ""Living With a Deaf Dog"" was a life saver. I felt so more at ease after reading the first few pages. I also had family and friends that interact with Kiko read it. Kiko was my wild child and is now on her way to being a well behaved adult."
3,Somewhat helpful,"I really wanted a how to book to help with our deaf puppy. Can't say this was it. It is helpful, but more about encouragement than how to."
3,"Anne Ramsey, you are sorely missed.","I don't really know anybody who misses this movie, but I do know quite a few who miss Anne Ramsey.How do you take an absolute witch of a character and make her not only hilarious but loveable as well? I couldn't do it. Neither could you. Sit back and enjoy Mrs. Ramsey make you laugh at beastly behavior.There's a story in here about Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito doing some sort of Hitchcockian murder scheme. I don't care, do you? What matters is that Anne Ramsey gives one of the most hilarious performances I have seen in a film.""Who are you?""""I'm Owen's friend.""""Owen doesn't have any friends!""""That's because he's shy.""""No he's not. He's fat and he's stupid.""Poor Owen. And yet, you still feel for Momma at the end of the movie. And you will believe that Owen still loves her. How does an actor do that?Not the greatest movie, but Mrs. Ramsey, nobody played the battleaxe quite like you."
2,The Mouths that Roared,"I figure this Danny DeVito film deserves two stars for its two nagging mouths that rage on ceaselessly: Anne Ramsey and Billy Crystal. Ramsey plays an unkillable troll whose repulsive personality becomes a perversely charming refuge from Crystal's incessant sado-narcissism. Crystal's character is so neurotically self-absorbed he can't stop babbling to himself even when he's required to share the screen with other actors. And in a rare change of pace from his usual wise-ass, cynical screen persona, DeVito plays a moron who can barely express himself.If you find Billy Crystal's follicle-shriveling monologues the most hilarious schtick ever, this film will wrench tears of joy from your eyes. In my case, the mute button was what enabled me to tough it out to the end of the movie."
1,This Movie ...,"What is the deal with this movie? Its ... beyond all belief! The plot is dumb and predictable, and its just stupid all the way around!I have a fine appreciation for the work of Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito, but this movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities. Very Stupid. Very unimpressive. I couldn't not reccomend it more."
5,danny devito - underpraised genius,this is one of the greatest movies of all time (in my top 5). just as good and better than the hitchcock movie it spoofs. devito is an unsung genius. glad to finally have this one widescreen to appreciate devito's cartoonish and insane vision
5,made a 90 year old mom very happy,"I ORDERED A VIDEO THAT MY SISTERS AND I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR.IT WAS THROW MOMMA FROM THE TRAIN, WHICH IS MY MOM'S FAVORITE.THANKS YOU AMAZON AND THANK YOU TO THE SELLER. THIS MADE MY 90YEAR OLD MOM AND 92 YEAR OLD DAD SO VERY HAPPY. GOD BLESS THEM BOTH"
1,How in the world???,"How in the world did they do it? Take two of the funniest actors on the planet, Danny DeVeto and Billy Crystal, and make an entirely unfunny movie with them as the stars? The script is horrible and the laughs are few and far between. Watch anything else by these two if you want a laugh, but avoid this bomb at all costs."
4,in your dreams,"Throw Momma From the Trainbilly crystal and danny de vito -- how can you miss? actually, there are movies from each of these guys which i don't like, but this isn't one of them.it's fun and funny, and anne ramsay is just a hoot!"
5,The funniest movie ever!,"In this funny funny film, Owen (Danny DeVito) hates his mother, and Larry (Billy Crystal) hates his X-wife who stole his idea for a book. They meet at a writing class and Owen asks Larry why he didn't like his murder story. Larry says ""There were only two characters, one of which is dead on page two."" One day, Owen goes to see ""Strangers on a train,"" and gets the idea for Larry to kill his mother, and himself to kill the X-wife. He does. Well, almost. Andt hen for the rest of the picture, he wants Larry to kill his mother. The scene when they try to throw momma from the train is so funny! And the other great scenes are ones such as the scene when Owen hits Larry over the head with a frying pan.The DVD should have had more special features. MGM is a lousy company at doing that. I mean, take a classic flick like ""Elmer Gantry,"" and give it only a trailer. The cut scenes deserved to be cut, but if you want to see them, do so.Rent it or buy it!"
3,Momma Is A Potty-Mouth,"Anne Ramsey is a hoot as the brutal old lady whom Danny DeVito wants to ""throw off the train."" She is truly a unique character. The black humor in here and the classic film references are always fun to hear. The story moves fast with no real lulls, so the hour-and-a-half flies by.I was sorry to hear Ramsey use the Lord's name in vain abouty a half dozen times while Crystal and Geiest exclaim way too many OMGs. Otherwise, with all the references, audibly and visually, to Alfred Hitchcock films - especially ""Starngers On A Train"" - it is always fun for a classic film buff to enjoy."
4,This is a must have,I saw this more than twenty years ago. I still think it is funny. My children like it also. They also like to see how outdated the electronics are.
3,throw mama,"I bought this movie from a suggestion from a friend, the movie reminded them of my mom in one particular situation, I have to admit it was strikingly familiar and funny."
4,Warning! - Not for Your Younger Set,"This book contains a lot of nudity, vulgarity, drug references and violence. Fine for adults, but would not recommend for the younger crowd."
3,GUINEA PIG TREATS,My Guinea Pigs really love this treat. They also enjoy the carrot and fruit flavors. I have kept Guinea Pigs for several years and have always had success with this product. I highly recommend this product.

2,Almost Exclusively a List of Varieties,"This is a list of varieties of cacti and succulents with very little information on each one -- a short paragraph. There is very little information on propagating, planting, etc., Not a book to start with."
5,New Cuban Fiction,"(...)""Estevez's second novel (after Thine Is the Kingdom) is a consummate affirmation of life amidst the squalor of Havana, with prose as lush as the Caribbean setting it describes. On the eve of the 21st century, a middle-aged (...) man named Victorio becomes homeless when the manor in which he rents an apartment is demolished. Wandering the streets, he encounters Salma, a young female prostitute, and Don Fuco, an older man trained as an acrobatic clown. The three move into a rundown theater and find solace with one another, especially while entertaining Havana's downtrodden with their clown act. Even when they must return to the harsh streets, Victorio and Salma find the strength and coursage to endure. Estevez's experience as a playwright (Night) is keenly evident in this novel's theatrical spirit. He enriches his novel further by drawing allusions, metaphors, and images from the literature and history of Cuba. Highly recommended for all fiction collections."" (...)"
4,Progress in motion.,"Comparing Icarus with the likes of Photek and Aphex Twin would be appropriate. In this second album Icarus has matured beyond the realm of imitation, and stepped into innovation. Best served cold with a good book and quiet night, FiJaka will rock your introspective world."
3,MARTINIS AND MURDER.,"To old school, not really my kind of reading. Kind of silly. A little to simple. Sort of wanders a little."
3,centaur131,"There was entirely too much thinking/editorizing by the two main characters. There was not enough action or dialogue. There was no plot actually made obvious until almost the end of the book. I always finish a book even if I'm not happy with it. I did not really get involved with this one until towards the end of the novel when the plot became clear. Even though I did like the two main characters, they were both bit stiff and the heroine became angry when there was no reason for her to do so. It could have been a much better and stronger story, especially when the author was dealing with a great era. I will probably read one more of her books to see if she is able to develop her story better. To summarize, there was entirely too much description of emotions/feelings, not enough dialogue and not enough action or explanation of what was going on."
3,"good, but could be so much better","Riders of the Silver Rim was entertaining and at some parts suspenseful, but i've also read Bodie Thoene's ZION COVENANT, ZION CHRONICLES, and SHILOH LEGACY. Riders of the Silver Rim could have been so much better if the plot had been more developed. The book seemed too rushed. One page something drastic happens and then you turn the page and it ends. The main plot was interesting to read, but(like i said)if it had been more developed it would have been a really great plot. Besides this, the book was fun to read and it makes you laugh and cry at the same time. Bodie Thoene you're doing an awesome job!"
1,bad news,"This hose has a very small warning label hidden inside the wraping that says do not drink from this hose,and wash hands after using. may contain lead and chemicals which can cause cancer and birth defects. now isn't this a hose everyone should want/"

1,Lumbar cushion,"Very unhappy. Bought for my husband's back - recovering from back surgery. He is a big man -- over six feet, 200 lbs and cushion was too small. Sides are hard so no give to them. Went to Walmart and bought a round oblong lumbar pillow -- cheaper and works better."

5,A superb work of art in every discipline.,"There couldn't possible ever be a better version of Bizet's masterpiece. Carmen herself could not have been cast any better. She is a spitfire. She is sexy. She IS Carmen.The direction is wonderful. The photography is simply breathtaking. Almost every scene is reminiscent of an old master painting.Even WITHOUT the music it would be a great movie. If I had more stars to give, this exquisite work of art would garner them all."
3,Good casting,"I got this DVD and another from Baltsa/Carreras/Metropolitan Opera at the same time and I enjoy both of them. I enjoy Domingo's Don Jose quite a lot however, I just don't like Migenes-Johnson's singing that much - her singing of Carmen may be the worst that I have ever heard. Anyway, she is definitely better at acting/shaking her body (or dancing) than singing, which is good for a movie. Plus, this movie delivers much better image and sound although I cannot get Dolby surround sound as what I got from the VHS tape. I am more pleased with this movie version since I don't want to listen to the noise from the audience while I was watching it, although the singing is not as good as the others on my CDs. I just bought one more copy of this DVD and I believe my friend will definitely like it."
3,Not bad.,"I think the intention of making this movie was to introduce opera to those who do not really enjoy it. I like this one because it's not a real opera but a movie, although I tried not to pay too much attention to Julia Migenes-Johnson while I was watching it. I wouldn't try this one if I was about to die for an opera, I would go with Victoria de Los Angeles/Nicholas Gedda."
5,I was thrilled!,"The music and acting were supurb. I have seen and loved this opera many, many times. I was not expecting much when I bought the DVD -- I was really suprised how wonderful it was. In addition to the wonderful voices, I loved the setting in which it was filmed."
5,Birthday Present,My mother LOVED her present! She was blown away with copy of Carmen. This has become one of pride possessions.
3,I fell asleep.,"I've seen Carmen a few times, and this one had a less visually colorful scheme going for it, but a unique angle on the story all the same. I remember a line from ""Moulin Rogue"", where one of the dancers tells the young aspiring writer, ""Never fall for a woman who sells herself for a living. It always ends badly!"" So it is with this French tail of a Gendarme falling for one of the local independent women.Truth is I remember the opera, but I don't remember much of this production because after I rented it and popped it in my old VHS player, I fell asleep. It was that boring. Carmen, like other operas given a cinematic sheen, isn't known for a lot of flashy and stylistic gloss, and so it is that this production is pretty plain in the beginning. Hence the reason I fell asleep.If you must see a version of Carmen on your TV screen, then take a chance on one of the more colorful stage production caught on video. This one misses a few marks."
2,Major disappointment,"This production has little to do with the original and includes cuts, additions. changes and endless extraneous footage of irrelevant incidents and stray dogs wandering about. Domingo has the only real voice in the lot and is badly mis-cast as a mama's boy. Migenes has neither the voice for it nor the breath control to sustain what she does have, the Micaela even less so. Even the usually dependable Raimondi has trouble reaching his low notes. For the gold standard go to the 1988 production from the Met with Agnes Baltsa, the world's greatest mezzo, singing a Carmen that will make the paint sag on your walls. Jose Carreras is the perfect Don Jose and Leona Mitchell is a Micaela with a voice to remember. Samuel Ramey is the Escamillo and the whole is conducted by James Levine."
2,This is defintely not the Carmen to own.,"This offering got off on the wrong foot with me with the gratuitous begining scene of an innocent bull being tortured in a bull ring.Opera is a total experience but rests firmly on the conductor and the singers, those requirements are not met here,the visual effects of the on location shoot do not compensate for the mediocre totality. If you are going to own one visual Carmen, let it be the 1982 Baltsa/Carreras, if you are primarily interested in the vocal performance then you must own 1964 Callas/Gedda (finest Don Jose ever)on CD, or the De Los Angeles/Gedda (forgotten performance date)Domingo gives a far more vocally convincing performance in the Covent Garden production w/ Denyce Graves, who not only presents herself well but can also sing."
5,Migenes Proves No One Is a Better Singing Actress Than She,"This film of the famous and often overplayed, overblown Bizet Opera was fresh and vibrant when it was first released in 1985, and that vibrancy is still present nearly 15 years later. Migenes protrayal of Carmen has no parallels...she sings, dances and acts with complete believability and becomes the character. Small wonder the french call her the greatest Carmen since Calvé. Domingo is in good voice and gives a better than average performance. Esham is visually a bit bland, but sings beautifully. Escamillo is fittingly protrayed. But the film belongs to Migenes with her multi-faceted protrayal of the most popular role in the operatic repertoire. For opera lovers, and lovers of good art, this film is a must!Obviously, Leonard Maltin is out of his league with his review of this film. He must have missed the point!"
5,Best of all Possible Worlds in Opera,My God I was mezmerized with this operatic musical; refreshing that many of the lines are spoken and not sung --- I have always felt singing every line of dialogue does not add to the opera. Domingo is so convincing as the crazed-jealous and spurned lover; best acting and singing in this role I ever saw. And Migenes...she is a hottie with a voice and boy can she act. Some of the opera purists do not like this but I say you do have the best of all possible worlds. Buy this film (unfortunately VERY HIGH- close to $200 on Amazon.com since it is out-of-print) and buy your favorite staged performance. I have three Carmen's and they are wonderfully different experiences.
5,"THIS PRODUCT REALLY, AND TRULY WORKS!!!!!!!!!","I think that if you really want the results of disappearing scars, then THIS IS THE ANSWER FOR YOU!!!! I've tried many other products, and I found out that they all were just a waste of money!! They didn't work! They wasted my time, and money! But this product is not a waste of money, and IT WILL BE WORTH BUYING!!!"
2,No face covering,I guess I don't know enough about bucket hats. My keratosis face needs something to cover more of my nose and cheeks.
2,Superfluous information,"I was disappointed in this guide. Though it profiles the three routes to the summit of Rainier and contains some nice color photos plus excellent maps, all of this you can get with a click of your mouse on the Internet. I was crushingly disappointed when this book arrived. It is intended to tote along with you on a Rainier ascent, that is obvious because of the books lightweight nature and the fact it folds into a small area. But the vast majority of mountaineers now use licensed guides, thus the book is irrelevant."
3,Not as bad as you might think......,Beautifully shot. And both Brooke Sheilds and Christopher Atkins are beautiful not just to look at but how they discover themselves growning up. Is the acting great? Brook tends to whine in a rather montone voice. Atkins seems fresher and more willing to play. But there is no denying their chemistry or the fact that Christopher Atkins in a barley there loin cloth is hot (when it is on that is!) The extras are non existent but I enjoyed the movie nevertheless.
1,It's not as good as Paradise,"I love Paradise - Pheobe Cates. I know many people think The Blue Lagoon is better but I saw both of them already and prefer Paradise! I hate many scene of The Blue Lagoon such as blood from Shields' menstruation, Remain of the old man etc. It's not smooth but rough . Infact, Brooke Shields and Pheobe Cates are both very very extremely enormously immensely gorgeous women in the world.Nudity from 2 exellent girls in this planet.... I gave Paradise 5 but The Blue Lagoon 1Sorry ..."
2,Am I the one that caught this?,"So I sat down to watch The Blue Lagoon. It's a great movie, but I couldn't help but notice how young Brooke Sheilds looked. It could have been because she was only 15 at the time. Now correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it illegal to put a 15 year old naked in a Motion Picture? Two words come to mind....Kiddie Porn. Just a thought..."
3,Sappy chick flick,The only reason I'm buying this movie is so that girls will put out when they come over to my place and watch it
2,Can it get more tacky?,"The action and dialog of this film are easily one of the worst ones I ever have seen. The plot is highly improbable, the form how the lifes of these two kids develop impossible. The behavior of the two defies all logic and is a bad transplant from what somebody who seemingly never lived through adolescence nor ever read a book about it believes to be adolescent behavior to an idyllic south sea island. The admittedly very good photography cannot save the moment nor let the viewer forget the stupidity of the movie itself. This is compounded by the total acting incompetence of Brooke Shields - and she isn't even good-looking enough to forgive her for her ineptitude."
3,What about Chris,"I didn't read all the reviews but noticed on the ones I read everyone talks about the nudity ( I know, they're doubles ) of Brooke.What about Chris? That's why I originally saw this movie and enjoyed watching. Very few films show male frontal nudity and it got more sterile as the years have gone on. Treated as complete taboo.Maybe I'm alone in this?Cheers to Chris! He fueled many a fantasy for me and was sorry his career didn't take off."
5,the blue lagoon is a beautifull film,"Brooke shields and christopher atkins are innocent child-like lovers who discover beauty and danger in an island paradise after being ship wrecked and stranded on a tropical island.Brooke shields has a lot of natural beauty and looks gorgeous and great in the blue lagoon.Christopher atkins is muscular and strong and swims naked with brooke shields.They both lose paradise when they try to get rescued and eat a poisoned berry.The music is captivating,great and uplifting and the blue lagoon is a fascinating to watch and beautifull film."
4,lt's a very deep and pesonal movie.,l saw this movie over the summer when l had just gotten over a past summer romance and l can say that this movie was one of the most romantic ones ever. l would say thought that it is for mature audiences only but it is still a wonderful movie that depicts the purity of love.
5,A CUTE MOVIE!,"I think this movie is one of the cutest and coming-of-age movies I've ever seen. If you feel like watching two teens fall in love on a deserted island, choose this one. I prefer this one much more than it's weak sequal."
3,"PUBESCENT LOVE, ISLAND STYLE","Coming of age and sexual awakening on the beaches of a deserted (well, almost) South Pacific island paradise struck a nerve in Randal Kleiser's huge 1980 hit. In this third remake of this archetypal fantasy, a nearly naked, pubescent Brooke Shields became an international star. Alas, not so for Christopger Atkins."
4,Very compelling,I saw the movie aired on the superstation and I absolutlyloved it.I rented it and watched it 4 more times.The movie isabout 2 children that get shipwrecked near an island.Time goes byand they jump ahead 10 or 12 years when they are arond 20.(by the way the children made the island there home)The two are always fighting but soon they fall in love without knowing it.They have a baby and stay on the island for about 2 years with the baby.One day they are in there little boat and they loose the paddlestheyre stranded in the boat for many days.I wont tell the ending.
2,R,"To counter the numerous suggestions by other reviews that this film is suitable for preteens to introduce concepts of sexuality and ""coming of age"", I must point out that the film is rated R, for good reason. If you want to watch it with your children, that's your perogative, but let me say that I watched it when I was 11, and I was quite blown away by the graphic depictions of sexual scenes in the movies, and it wouldn't have made much of a difference if my parents were there with me or not. Granted, these are ""tender"" scenes without violence or disrepect like many other movies, but still, I had never seen anything like it, and it was too much all at once. So, beware."
5,"""I LOVE IT""",THE PERSON THAT DID DON'T LIKE THIS MOVIE NEEDS TO GET A LIVE AND ENJOY ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER!!
5,The Blue Lagoon,It took me forever to find this movie. I was so happy that I found it and I love it. It is so clear and the sound comes out so clear on my surround sound. So I reccomend this to anyone else who would like to buy this film.
4,A true romance,"This movie is amazing. I don't really understand how people can be so outraged about the nudity in the film. First of all, they were stranded on a tropical island, and therefore, didn't have much clothing. I thought it adapted quite well to the plot.I can't begin to describe this amazing film in words. All i can say is it is a must-be-seen movie. Although i wouldn't reccomend young children to see it, even though it would probably fly over their heads.Trust me on this, The Blue Lagoon is one of the best american classics of our time. You just need to see it to believe it!"
2,"""What's the matter with you? Tired of living?""",Even at 62 minutes this cheapo noir overstayed its welcome by about 30 minutes.Some guy mad at his girlfriend stabs her to death at a train station and dumps her body on an outgoing train. He tries to leave town but he can't because the roads washed out. With nowhere to go he stays at a boarding house but a young boy who lives there thinks the stranger looks like a man he saw at the train station earlier. Now he's gotta shut this kid up before people get wise.It might sound good but it ain't. The acting is passable but the script feels like it was slapped together over lunch. Also the Alpha Video DVD is sorry with a sucky picture and a low humming sound.
4,Tom Hanks looks so young!,"I caught this film on HBO or Showtime the other night, after not having seen it in years and I have to say that it's better than I remembered it. I totally loved the non-standup comedy details of the film- Hanks making comments about ""going under"" as he tries in vein to clean himself up before going onstage after not having taken a shower in awhile due to the fact that he's been kicked out of his apartment, Sally Field's portrayol of a woman wanting more in her life than just motherhood, etc. You really get the feeling that these are real people with dreams and you want to root for them, hoping that they'll ""make it"". I found myself getting nervous before each of their stand up performances. Anyway, great film, highly recommended."
5,EXTREMELY UNDERRATED!,"This is such a good movie! Tom Hanks plays a promising, self - destructive comic with emotional problems, and gives an OSCAR-CALIBUR PERFORMANCE! I have been a huge fan of Hanks since Bosom Buddies, but this was the film which made me realize just how great he is! It actually came out about the same time as ""Big"", which Hanks was nominated for, and I never understood why this film got slighted. Check it out, and see the first sign of the greatness to come in ""Philledelphia"" and Forest Gump""!"
4,Very Enjoyible,"They are trying to be stand up comics, its very funny! I got a stomach ache I laugh so hard. Tom Hanks and Sally Feild shine with the help of John Goodman."
3,Punchline - Fairly routine,"The pursuit of one's dream, no matter what the consequences, is what this movie is all about. Tom Hanks and Sally Field have stand-up comedy in their blood. But there are obstacles to achieving the dream of doing comedy: for Hanks it's his father who wants him to be a doctor; for Fields it's a husband and family. Hanks wants Fields to run away with him, but Fields has it out with her husband, explains her needs, and he buys into it. A lot of the movie takes place in comedy clubs where Hanks can play his wacky role to the hilt, but Fields seems out of place and not very funny: when she wins the contest at the end and then refuses to accept the prize in order to join her husband - this is called eating your cake and having it, too - it's the biggest fraud of all. Just not a very believable movie."
2,Mediocre at best,"I remember seeing this movie in the theaters. I saw it on television today for the first time in a long time. It is pretty much as plain as I remember it. If the comedy club scenes are supposed to make you laugh, they did not succeed with me.Not being a big fan of Tom Hanks, he met my expectations of a boring performance. Sally Field should have avoided this movie. It is interesting to see this movie if you are into 1980's movies, but I don't recommend buying it for your collection."
2,This book needs an editor,Don't think this book will help most people. There are too many dimensions missing and wrong. On the Federal mantel the writeup says cut the columns 10 1/2 inches wide but the drawing shows 12 inches. The picture of the mantel shows a full brick clearance at the side of the firebox but the drawing is more like 5 inches.I got an idea of how a mantel could be made but you must work out your own dimensions. There is no bill of materials as stated before. I think there must be better books on this subject. Not too important but one screw is drawn with left had screws. I am a machanical engineer trying to do wood work.
1,Skip it!,"I was looking to build my own mantel, and was looking for a few ideas, this book had very few. Poor models (i.e. dimensional issues) and bad editing made it a drag to get through. And on a personal note, the mantels featured in this book are simply put, ugly, and would work in very few homes."
5,Consistantly Excellent!,"Many of Big Joe Turner's Pablo recordings matched him with big names, but this workout finds him jubilant and in top form singing with some lesser-known musicians (altoist Bob Smith, Herman Bennett on second guitar, pianist J.D. Nicholson, bassist Winston McGregor, drummer Charles Randall and the only ""name"" of the date, guitarist Pee Wee Crayton). The solos of Smith (who sounds like a mixture of Tab Smith and Johnny Hodges) and Crayton are consistently excellent, and Big Joe turns everything into blues, including such unlikely material as ""Sweet Lorraine"" and ""Pennies from Heaven."" This recording gives listeners a good example of what it was like to catch the great blues singer during a club date with a pickup band."
2,not worth it,"There are plenty of other sleeves to choose from; don't choose these. Both were ripped at the corners when I opened the box, and they only included one clear cover to protect the screen. Useless if you're giving one of the sleeves to someone else."
5,A bargain at ten times its price,"The transformative effect this book initiated in my Tai Chi/ Qigong practice of thirteen years has been invaluable. Master Liao's emphasis on chi awareness and cultivation stands in sharp contrast to that of many teachers who focus on a sequence of memory - stretching postures, i.e., placing quantity above quality. That being said, I would foreworn readers that at least several weeks to months of consistent practice may be necessary for most individuals to begin to realize the benefits of Master Liao's teaching."
5,Excellent Reading,"Waysun Liao's words are written in laymen's terms which are understandable and succinct. It give one food for thought and exploration of the ""chi"" within. Excellent reading !!!"
3,If you like soap operas...,"I had to read this for my Contemporary Lit class. I didn't like it, but it was well written. Basically, it's about this guy, Martin Lynch-Gibbon, who's cheating on his wife Antonia. When Antonia tells him she's leaving him for her psychoanalyst, chaos ensues. This book is like musical chairs, except with beds. There's only one character that doesn't have sex in the book. If you like soap operas or books about infidelity, check this one out. It's loaded with drama, lies, and betrayal.Iris Murdoch has put a lot of irony intentioned to be humor, but I just found it odd. I don't like any of the characters, and Martin keeps making the same mistakes over and over. The ending was the weakest part."
3,A strange experience...,"I am not quite sure how I feel about this book, certainly I enjoyed the writing, very analytical and composed, certainly I felt enough underlying cynical tone about the insanity of playing sexual musical chairs...But this book left me feeling that I am not so satisfied...not so convinced...feeling as if exploited..could this be what the author intended to produce in readers? A severed head with a coin in the mouth with all the ridiculous wishes and dreams?...The absurdity that somebody described as treating other people as one's own lottery ticket of all dreams?"
4,Iris Murdoch is a literary genius,"Iris Murdoch, writer of over 25 plays, short stories, essays, and novels, writes about the relationships of Martin Lynch-Gibbons and his wife Antonia. The plot thinckens as Palmer Anderson and Honor Klein enter the scene... A satire on relationships. Truly a great book to read on a rainy night."
1,incongruous,"Incongruous and shallow, full of falsely complex characters who get involved in inexplicable acts. Today the material looks too 'early sixties' - and it has aged badly."
4,Understanding this book,"I read this book in college. Some previous reader had underlined every appearance of the word ""understand"" - and for once I was grateful. I suggest you try that too."
5,Good batteries...great price,"These are good-quality batteries (we're using them in our smoke alarms), and the price (including shipping) is far better than you can get anywhere else...online or in-person."
1,Batteries Not to Buy,"I have been so disappointed with these batteries. I change my smoke detector batteries every December 31st and never have an issue with them lasting a year but here we are April 12th and I have now replaced 3 with low power, mid you these are devices that have little current draw and should easily last a year. The last battery I took out even allowed some acid to flow out it did not hurt anything but it was trash. So I give these a VERY LOW RATING>"
1,Old batteries,I bought these in August 2009. They had an expiration date of Dec 2009. I ended up discarding half of them because by the time I got around to using them they were essentially dead. They would power a smoke detector for less than a week.
5,Fresh and inexpensive; made in USA,"I've used Rayovac batteries many times, and have always found them to be about the same as other brands in terms of longevity (comparing them against other regular alkaline batteries). This pack of 8 was less expensive than purchasing them at a warehouse club, and much less expensive than a regular store.The batteries come in a thin plastic case for ease of storage. I purchased them in Nov 2011 and the ""best by"" date on the batteries was Dec 2016.Also like the fact that they are made in the USA. Highly recommend."
5,Rayonvac batteries,They're batteries all right. They come in a nice little box and work just as well as any other brands. But for only about $13 for 8? That's an incredible steal. The store down the street sells 9v's for about $5 EACH. Next time I need 9v batteries I will just buy another pack of these. Or perhaps several packs.
4,Smoke detector batteries,"I bought these to replace my smoke detector batteries. It's been a month, so far so good. Good price when compared to Walmart, Sam's, etc."
5,Such a deal,I tested every battery in the pack and found them all fully charged.At the price i replaced everything i had that took this size.Mine have a 2016 date code on them :)
1,Don't waste your money on these batteries,Buy these only if you want to keep changing your fire alarm battery every week or so. That's what I have been doing. 8 pack will last approximately 8 weeks.
3,The 9 volt found less price on line,"If you could drop price off my credit card by 2,50 I would buy 4 more of these I use alot in the recording buisnessAND credit my card 2.50I would be greatful and buy only from youtHANKS del"
1,Bad Batteries,These batteries do not last. I've had to replace 3 already in a span of a month for my fire alarm.
3,Good idea; not so good songs,"Guitarrist Steve Howe did a subtle and heartful tribute to his idol, Bob Dylan. The record is good, but some of the songs are not the best from Dylan. Anyway, it's a great effort and a good introduction to those few who doesn't know Dylan's music. It has a different singer in each song, although the rest of the band is the same. Good"
4,don't think twice...pick up this Portrait,"People who know Steve Howe soley by reputation will be suprised after hearing this album. Howe's skillful playing is still evident, don't get me wrong (especially his picking on ""Don't Think Twice"" and ""Buckets of Rain""), but this Bob Dylan tribute sticks to being a song-oriented project, first & foremost.Whenever I hear these tunes, I feel like I'm sitting with some friends around a bonfire late at night. Both Steve Howe & Bob Dylan fans should approve, as well as music fans in general."
1,Bad Case,"The CD case was bad: there was a BB size hole in it. Luckily the CD was good. I gave this CD as a gift for Christmas, and, besides the fact that the recipient already had it, it was not very presentable in its original state. If it was'nt for my good job with the wrapping paper and my known poor status, I would have been very embarrassed. Instead they just felt sorry for me."
4,Great classic salsa,As a matter of fact I had not discovered Joe Bataan till recently. This album is a superb instrumental work and is full of good New York salsa mixed with a flavor of jazz. The only reason I do not rate it as a 5 stars is due to the voices. They are poor and make the album lose a little. Anyway I recommend the purchase. You'll enjoy it. Fantastic rhythm.
3,The Inside Story,"This book presents an academic approach to the subject of ceramic ware produced by Johnson Brothers during their existence as an independant company. It does not convey the romance that the antique collect looks for. I feel that Mary Finegan lost an opportunity whilst visiting the U.K. to talk to the very person that could have given her that insight. William (Bill) Norbury worked for Johnson Bros. for 50 yrs. He had that insight as designer and Master engrave and was still alive during her visit. Prof.Jean Zarruchi conveyed that romance during her lecture and exhibition at Keele Universtity, Staffs.U.K. Sept. 2000. Bill's unpublished record of his experiences conveys that insight into many of the designs contained in Mary Finegan's Book. (...)"
1,don't buy,"This product stains! And it doesn't adhere to the hair. After wearing two pink streaks all day long, every time I'd run my fingers through my hair they'd turn pink. My shirt also got dyed pink throughout the day. If you want pink streaks you're better off bleaching the hair and using cool aid as pink dye. If you want a Halloween pink hair look you're better off with a pink wig."
2,Cheap and unattractive,"I'm a psychology professor and do research with children. I purchased these puppets to use with children in my projects. At this price, I didn't expect extremely high quality puppets. However, when they arrived, I was rather surprised at the shoddy quality. In particular, the puppets are much smaller than I'd imagined - more like finger puppets, as the arms are essentially functionless.Furthermore, the female puppets are clearly wearing dresses; thus their bodies appear to be full-length. However, the male puppets seem to end at the waist. When I unpackaged them, one of my graduate students stopped by and asked why the father was wearing a pink dress! These puppets have been used with children a few times in my lab, but they have been mostly uninterested in them. I can't blame them! Next time I'll splurge and buy better puppets."
5,An early Forbes classic!,"Written in 1969, this blistering action thriller is set in 1940 in occupied northern France. Stranded behind German enemy lines, a lone British Army tank must do whatever it can to reach the Channel port of Dunkirk and Allied forces. The crew use cunning, force and even help from an RAF pilot whose Spitfire is downed by a Stuka bomber with a few token French farmers thrown in for good measure! The action scenes are first rate and the suspense builds as the German Wehrmacht approach and the tank crew hides wherever they can. The horrors of war are also well described, showing how innocent people suffered under the hands of the Nazi invaders. And Forbes describes the French locations accurately - it is another part of Europe I have visited. If you enjoyed Harold Coyle's tank warfare stories such as SWORD POINT and TEAM YANKEE then don't miss this exciting depiction of WW2 from one tank crew's viewpoint."
1,Absolute trash,Pure pornographic trash. I read ten pages and sent it to the trash bin. Poorly written and disguised as a book.I do not have to eat a whole apple to see that it is rotten.
5,Amazing album,What can I say? Brian Crain has yet to disappoint me all of the tracks here are wonderful and worth getting.
4,candi is back and better than ever,"recently in baltimore,maryland i had the oppertunity to meet a music legend..miss candi staton. annd even though i was only a child when i was first introduced to her music ,she still sounds as good as she did in the 70's. hearing her sweet voice ring throuhout the crowd of listeners at the meyerhoff symphony hall i realized that this is a voice that deserves a closer look ,or better yet a closer listen. i went out and purchased the cd and i really enjoyed it that sweet voice is still in top form and the music, although gospel and not disco , proves not only is she versitile , but she is going to be a welcome voice for the new mellennium"
4,Draw sketches!,"I've ever heard that the best way to draw sketches is from life. But how to get sketches that move in a natural way?Glenn proposes to draw from fitness videos, and the books is full of examples on how to do it.A must have to draw figure motion."
2,Clueless,"I have just finished the book of Glenn Fabry ""Muscles in Motion"". The cover of the book was very promising and I thus have pre-order it. I was quite disappointed when I received it. I expected this book to be a kind of step by step guide to draw muscles or at the very least, a book which could teach me a trick or two from a pro. Nada! This book contains quasi no instruction. It's even hard to explain the contents of this book.They are hundreds of drawings made from freeze-frame images from a videotape. Pages and pages of images of bodybuilders or dancers following each others like a broken down animation. The drawings are too sketchy and small to be a book of references and Fabry doesn't explain anything. I really don't know who would be interested in buying this book but I prefer the more easier approch to figure drawing and muscles from Loomis, Jack Hamm or even Bridgman.N.B.: I took the liberty of scanning a few pages from the book. You be the judge..."
1,A thought it was good ... I thought wrong!,"the artist is a good sketcher ... No more, this book is useless for any comics fan or artists ... for me it was a wast of money ...Note: it's about female sketching ... some are porn poses ..."
3,Gothic at its best,"What more can one possibly ask for? Two separate haunted areas, forbidden love, murder, torture, a picture worthy of Dorian Grey, a wing of the house worthy of Rebecca, and a mystery upon mystery. The best way to describe this book is to have you think of every gothic novel's plot you have ever read, heard of, or imagined, and then remember this, it is all in there. Every single gothic plot or image is in this novel. The main character is an interesting and enjoyable character, though she and her lover do spend far too much time weeping, and one really does mean to say FAR too much. She is the exact opposite from Catherine in Nothanger Abby, except in the idea of letting their imaginations get the better of them. Still this book is the epiphany of gothic literature, and any true Jane Austen fan must read it if they truly want to enjoy Northanger Abby"
5,I love this book,"I had to read this for a sophomore seminar in college. I had never even heard of Ann Radcliffe and was more than a little intimidated at the size of the novel. And the first 150 pages of endless descriptions of the Alps didn't help. But once you get past that, you'll be completely swept up in the story, the intrigues, the romance, the danger and the creepiness. It was well over 10 years ago that I read this and I STILL think back on how entertaining and captivating it was. Don't be scared off! And I'm shocked that Ann Radcliffe isn't better known for her legacy to English literature (gothic, in particular!)"
4,An absolute corker!,"Good to see the great man back in action. The Wonder Stuff are long gone (but still not forgotten in my neck of the woods), and this piece is lyrically and musically on par with their finest work. It's been a long time coming, but it's been worth the wait. Although very folky in parts, i could still see 'Manna From Heaven' and 'Slow Drowning' ripping a club in half, and leaving them gasping for more. I just can't wait for him to pick up his electric again.Bring it on Miles......and thank-you once again."
3,Let's not get carried away here.,"Ok, ok, Manna from Heaven is a great song, and I saw a recent gig, which was excellent. But a lot of this album is very boring and is not good music. Miles, stop whining and make some songs to jump around to, like the good old days. And what is it with Paul Weller? All I every read about Miles is him going on about how Mr Weller changed his life for this and that. Jeesh."
3,CD is ok,The CDs are ok. They are a little bit hard to follow. For better learning you have to repeat the same CD a lot of times.
3,To greasy for me!,"I bought this by mistake. I meant to get the Neutrogena Sheer Dry Touch sunblock. I decided that I would try it anyways. It had a funny smell to it. I don't know if they are all like this. I bought it from Rite Aid, so I'm sure it was not old.I also thought it was to greasy for my face. I am still using it so it doesn't go to waste. I did go to the lake and use it and it worked great, I didn't get burnt on my face.I won't buy it again.If you want to try another sunblock try the Sheer Dry Touch by Neutrogena. It doesn't feel greasy at all!! I love it."
2,Flaky,"Thought this would be a great sunblock, and I'm sure it is. However, for some reason my foundation will not apply correctly over it. After the foundation is on, my face starts flaking.....like the sunblock is coming off and mixing with the color. I have to completely wash off everything and try again. Having done this several times to no avail, I stopped using it. Does anyone know why it would do this? Wish I could use it...don't like throwing money away."
3,Greasy....,"I appreciate the price and the UVA protection, but it's pretty greasy. It leaves a sticky shine on my face that does not wear well under my powder foundation. I also think it may be causing small breakouts on my extremely oily, acne-prone skin. I also wish Neutrogena provided some indication of the level of UVA protection, as the European sunscreens do. While the price is excellent compared to sunscreens such as La Roche's Anthelios, because I don't know just how wrinkle-protective this sunscreen is, I may continue to fork out good money for the European brands."
3,"3.5 Stars, if I had a Choice","Refreshing, warm and endearing, ""Birdy"" is a crowd pleaser in the way the inferior ""Gilbert Grape"" but vastly superior ""Rain Man"" were. Families will love it, and the underdogs among us will have reason to cheer for a change. Modine is fantastic, and seeing him again in this performnance made me respect him anew as an actor. While the film succeeds on many levels, it meanders more often than not, with unecessary side stories and a plodding score. Still, it's a winner on the whole, and a great rainy afternoon flick!"
3,Birds make me wanna get naked,"And now for something completely different.This is an intensely dramatic film about coming of age and Vietnam, and it never fails to take itself 100% seriously. But a few scenes, well, they're etched into my brain forever like the scars on Nicholas ""delusions of adequacy"" Cage's face.I'm certainly not calling it a bad movie. Three stars, and I watched it all the way through. But damn, if I hadn't seen the ""1984"" part, I'd have called it a career killer for a naked man in a bird cage. Dude dreamed about birds, woke up naked, and towelled himself off below the waist. That's weird.Put another way, this movie definitely works on the level it's meant to, as a dramatic and moving story. But I could also picture the yahoos at The Agony Booth having a field day with the screen shots and the captions, which I was doing at the same time as I was watching it dramatically."
1,Awful,This movie was so awful it prompted me to write my first review. The DVD is now a beer coaster. I would give it zero stars if I could.
2,Cannibal Smannibal,"Say what ? Some one gave this lobsterfest 5 stars? My _ss.This starts off right on the money with these two bucks picken up a couple ofhoe's at the bar and then it slows to a painful crawl.The cast is great but I need more action in my ""Cannibal"" films.Now the man meat joke and a few other inside pokes in the ribs are fun.I think the idea of the story is cool and I am not saying it's a total waste of timebut by my standard it's to slow and plodding."
5,Cinematic triumph!,"This film is worth sitting through just to see the spectacular cinematography and to hear the breathtaking musical score. However, it is far more than that. A powerful story about a Jesuit priest who has the courage to show solidarity with a poor, native tribe in South America, despite the militant attempts by his fellow Europeans to enslave the natives. Stunning performances by Jeremy Irons and Robert DeNiro. A tribute to Christian missionaries everywhere, who work powerfully to spread the love of Christ around the world."
4,Irons'performance carries the movie.,"Jeremy Irons is one of the finest actors working today, and he makes his character in The Mission totaly believable. The sign of a great actor is that one cannot tell he is acting. DeNiro may be miscast in his role, but the other actors, the cinimatography, the soundtrack, and the story make this a thoughtful work of historical fiction."
4,3.8 out of 5,"Nominated for seven Academy Awards and taking in one for ""Best Cinematography"", THE MISSION is director Roland Joffe's interesting drama. Based on fact and scripted by Robert Bolt, the film is set in 18th century Spain, where a ruthless slave-trader (Robert De Niro) becomes a Jesuit as the Europeans attempt to remove the Portuguese from the land. De Niro is excellent, but without the action of his normal performances, he's almost boring; Jeremy Irons as his ""mentor"" is terrific as well; there's also a good if not small performance by a young Liam Neeson, among others. Ennio Morricone has a smooth, moving score that works well with the film's misty, sometimes relaxing production design. It may not have deserved the ""Best Picture"" award it was nominated for, but THE MISSION is a calm drama to watch in your spare time."
4,The Mission,I saw this video years ago but I still remember it as being very exciting and action filled with superb acting. I think it is one of the best action-adventure film ever made. And it was shot on location. The photography was stunning.
4,A Must See Movie,"The Mission is a powerful movie with a powerful message about sin, redemption, and love. It probes deep into the evils of the Catholic Church in Spain and Portugal in teh mid 18th century. Robert De Niro brilliantly portrays Rodrigo Mendoza, a dynamic character who transforms his life to a murderer who trades slaves to a Jesuit priest who fights for those seemingly 'enslaved' natives - the Guaranese. Jeremy Irons ixquisitley plays the role of a truly Christ-like figure. Father Gabriel is the epitomy of compassion, lvove, and understanding. With an incredibly written screenplay by Robert Bolt (who also wrote A Man For All Seasons), the Mission is an incredible film which explores the depths and beauty of morality and life ont he path to Jesus Christ."
2,INCOMPLETE & LOOSE,"This was advertised as a 2 disc set but only came with one. No biggie for me as the price was low but still, falsely advertised. Also, the lone disc was loose & floating in the case & was scratched. Still plays ok but who knows for how long"
5,Mission accomplished,"Order received as promised. However, there was some conflicting information as to delivery date ( 7 days; 14 days)."
4,This One's an Eye Opener,"The Mission, directed by Roland Joffe is a film that will challenge your historical knowledge. This film targets a naive audience, such as myself, and hopes to spread the truth of what happened a long time ago between Spain, Portugal and the Guarani Indians. Robert DeNiro plays Mendoza, a Spanish slave trader, whose life takes a drastic turn that will leave you surprised long after the credits. This film entails a battle between the work of God versus the power of law. In this film, unity provides a sense of hope for a better tomorrow. Beyond that, chances are taken that may cost lives. The Mission will reach out and grab your attention, but more importantly it will leave you thinking you may not know all you should about our history. This film will leave people with much to wonder and little to forget."
2,Not for the kids......,Movie was harsh and got more difficult to watch as time progressed. I did not enjoy or appreciate this one!
3,Predictable but enjoyable,"When you say the cinematography and music are the best things about a movie, that doesn't say much for the script. I thought the acting was good, but that was eclipsed by the music and setting. Worth renting and watching. Probably not worth buying."
4,Great disk set.,"Great box set I gave my wife for Christmas. Easy to order, quickly shipped, arrived well packaged. Excellent movie, well acted and wonderful location scenery.Patrick"
5,Breathtaking! A movie to view over and over again!,"A magnificent masterpiece, superb soundtrack, and a story that is truly heartbreaking. For anyone who truly loves the cinematic experience, this is the movie that is a must see. I am anxiously waiting to see this on BD."
5,The Mission 1986 - Post review,"This movie was compelling & full of breathtaking scenery in Columbia which was based upon the Indian tribes in the upper regions high above cascading waterfalls, to be converted by Christianity. Robert De Niro & Jeremy Irons were the leading characters of this beautiful movie which encapsulated the heart in a spellbound though dramatic conclusion. I found that these actors put more emphasis on the culture of the tribes people and their way of life which was combined to give the audience a sense of warm embrace towards the suffering and cruelty acts which occurred between the late 1700's to the early 1800 year period. A MUST HAVE for any serious Movie Buff who wishes to transcend back in time to a civilization rich & full of culture. 5 Star rating applicable.*****"
1,Awful,"It is bad enough that these things happen in real life, but to make a movie about it... This film definitely left you thinking - if you could get through all the gory violence."
5,The Mission,Wonderful film. Very inspiring. A must see for almost everyone. The music is incredible and I highly recommend watching the film and purchasing the soundtract.
3,The Mission,"I enjoyed the movie. However, I felt that DiNero didn't fit the character, since he's been type casted in so many other movies."
4,A good movie at a good price.,"This is a great classic movie. I've had a hard time finding it. This DVD edition with all the special features is an outstanding buy. The nudity in the film makes this a movie that you don't want to watch with adolescents (unless you enjoy blushing girls and snickering boys). I would recommend it for adult audiences, however."
3,The Mission is a tale of the struggle for freedom.,"The Mission, yet another movie from the wonderful screenwriter Robert Bolt (A Man For All Seasons), is an inspiring tale of the struggle for freedom. The various characters in the movie all attempt to find happiness within themselves. Rodrigo, for example, wants to be free of his guilt. Father Gabriel was to be free of violence, and the natives just want to be free. This film is an excellent depiction of what South America was like as the Europeans invaded in the 18th century. You will feel the characters pain while cheering the ""good guys"" and booing the ""bad guys."" Happy viewing."
4,Does right or wrong matter?,"Esta película es una de las más fuertes que he visto. Me gustaba mucho y la recomendara.La música que juega Gabriel (Irons) para cultivar relaciónes con los guaraní es un hilo a través de la película. Es muy poderosa y transmite un sentimiento que crea un bono con el espectador.Los temas que se tratan abarcan varios áreas--el político, los indígenas, la esclavitud, el cristianismo, la iglesia católica, el pecado y la penitencia, la lucha entre lo bueno y lo malo--cuando, como siempre por las edades, lo más importante es quién tiene el poder. De estos, especialmente me gustaba la contradicción entre las enseñanzas de la iglesia católica en vista de las acciones de ella."
4,"Not a happy story, but interesting","Great photography, good acting, sad story. Would have been much better if it had included much more of the Iguacu Falls. What a shortcoming!"
3,slow plot,"Maybe I just expected more of a movie starring Robert De Niro and Liam Neeson, but I was disappointed. The plot moved slow from the beginning. The pace never seemed to pick up. The overall theme of the movie was good, but that, of course, made the ending predictable."
5,Breathtaking,"Fantastic actors, gorgeous cinematography and a hauntingly elegant score. One of the most touching scenes (and one of my favorites) is where Robert Deniro's character goes through penance. This is a truly remarkable film."
5,The Mission,An eye-opening true story.Beautiful scenery!We should all think about what happens when we try to change the cultures of these wonderful people.
3,A moving film for the spiritually guilty person.,"This film is one of the better religious movies I have seen. It encaptures the theme of forgiveness in a very touching way. After watching this film I felt inspired to find ways in which I could be forgiven. The Mission also encaptures the ideas of non-violence and social justice. If you are interested in European conquest and how religion was associated, then I would definatly suggest this film for you."
1,the dvd did not work on my TV and I sent another set of the Mission to a friend which didn't work either.,The DVD seemed to be set up for Canada and USA and did not work for us or for my friend who had it from me as a Christmas present.
3,"Mission, almost","So much more could have been done with all they had,great actors,location of some of the last great natural places of the world, and true exploited natives of that land. IT seemed to me halfway in they rushed to cut this thing together."
4,Mission,The movie was is good quality. It instantly uploaded and I didn't have to do much besides sit back and watch.
4,Beautiful,Beautifully made film with memorable scenes and music. The vistas and favourable portrayals of simplicity and virtue capture the imagination.Perhaps overly long and perhaps in need of further character development of de Niro's character. This is nevertheless a worthwhile film which anyone with an affection for the beauty of simplicity and the threat of misguided power will appreciate.
1,The Mission,This DVD would not play and displayed a copy write infringement. I would like to know why and should I reportit to the authorities.
1,Be aware of Regional viewing issues!,"I purchased this DVD from a private seller to view as a requirement for a graduate level class and when I tried to watch it, an error code popped up telling me that I did not have authority to view it in my ""Region."" Upon researching this error, I learned that all DVD players and DVDs are coded by Region, and DVDs cannot be viewed in different regions; for instance, the USA, Canada and Bermuda are Region 1, and Region 2 includes parts of Europe, Egypt, Japan, South Africa, Swaziland, Greeland, etc. The DVD that I bought, purchased here in the US, is only authorized for viewing in Region 2. I have learned my lesson, and write this review to alert others to be aware of something that I had no idea even existed."
2,"""We're going to make Christians of these people! ""","Yep, thats the problem alright.(Insert voice of 6 year old girl) BORRRRIINNNNG!!! Well, I waited over 20 something years to see this, I probably could have held out for another 80 some odd. Deniro looked pretty cool as the Jesus character, he would have looked better in a tie with an orange circle painted around his head. 2 blades, and I'm being kind."
1,The Indians had a religion too you know,"This film is mediocre at best, if visually stunning. The film celebrates missionary work rather than show the truth: Western christian missionaries are largely responsible for the destruction of many fascinating and beautiful cultures around the world. Only ""Black Robe"" and ""At Play In the Fields of the Lord"" had the you-know-whats to stand up and say it."
1,A disappointment,"My disappointment is because, having received the disc, I found it would not work in European format. The subject of the film was the basis of a discussion I had with several friends when the bi-centenary of the abolition was discussed. I told of this film which I had seen in the UK some years back. As I could neither see it nor show it, I lost my argument!!"
1,Hated It!,"Unfortunately, I was forced to watch this movie for my World Cultures class. I really hated it, although it had its good moments. I didn't see the point the whole movie;it went it circles! I wish the writers could have found a better way to get to the point."
1,This Sucks!!!!!! Very Very Sucky and Boring,I just watched this movie in Morality class and it is a really boring movie that just drags on and on. How does a movie end by every one including De Nero and Irons (major characters) along with everyone else die. There is only one movie that pulled off having all the characters die in it and that was Glory. I don't under any circumstances recommend this movie to anyone. If you want to see it thats your businees I just thinks it sucked. I had to watch it last year in Morality Class and I dont know how i stayed up to watch it it was so boring. But I did. Anyway it sucks.
3,It's Good,It's good for parties and if you love to sing songs by Madonna. I recommend this title if you don't even like Madonna but like Karaoke.
3,In-depth technical study marred by deceitful marketing ploy,"The book cover jacket states,""Look into this book for: A custom composite index formula that will diverge against RSI.."" This is also stated on the back cover and with front cover chart examples. Unfortunately the author reneges on this claim in the body of this book only to show the potential of the indicator and direct the reader to her web site that charges $5500.00 for a few select traders to whom she will reveal this information. I have no problem with technicians keeping their proprietary studies to themselves, but this book deceitfully makes an offer, accepts payment and does not deliver. This seems to me like a deceptive marketing ploy that mars what is an obviously perceptive and in-depth study of technical indicators in the futures industry. It is suprising that the renowned George C. Lane would give this his Foreward and support."
2,Not Ethical,"All book writing about a wonderful indicator for the market, and then withhold it. If you go to the website of the author she offers you the formula for about $1,000.00. That was tricky and not ethical......"
5,Excellent contribution to subject of technical analysis,"Technical Analysis for the Trading Professional is a book that I keep close at hand when I am preparing to trade. It's allowed me to look at the use and application of all indicators: oscillators, moving averages, trendlines etc., in entirely new ways. Although the book is advertised as being for the ""Trading Profesional"" the material is presented in such a thorough way that any serious student will gain much useful knowledge from the pages. If you are a follower of Elliott, Gann or Fibonacci analysis the information provided is a new slant on practical and very useful application of those theories. Its one of the books in my financial library that I recommend as an absolute ""must read""."
3,GOOD BUT DISAPPOINTED!!!,"This book is informative and interesting. Her book made me reviving the old concepts about indicatVery indicators are remarkable. In her book, she introduced some new indicators especially Composite Index. However she did not disclose the formula of indicator she introduced. I invested $71 for buying this book. Very disappointed. Next time, I will check the disclosure of new concepts."
1,All About Technical Analysis??,"Before taking credit for an ""indicator"" - - don't you think you should have checked with the man who discovered it?? While plagarism is the ""highest form of flattery"" - no matter what you call it - ""a duck is still a duck."" I would be interested to hear what Mr. Cardwell has to say about ""your"" book and ""your"" CMB indicator.....looks too familiar to Mr. Cardwell's work, who has been referred to as ""the worlds leading authority on the RSI""."
2,Not Worth it,I am an experienced trader and an avid reader of trading books. This book has nothing new to offer since the author doesn't reveal any of her secrets unless you are willing to go to her website and pay $800 to get access to some of her indicators. She spends pages and pages to expalin very simple concepts. Total waiste of money and time.
1,It burns well in the Fireplace,"A thousand extra words were used for each ""concept"". I was suckered into trying out her service after being deferred to her website for all the ""good stuff"". I paid [$$$] for a quarter for what I now see is false advertising and I honestly have never seen someone make so many bad observations and be so wrong over any 3 month time frame. I've seen amateurs make more consistent calls at yahoo.A total shame that she holds back all the stuff that she claims works best, but clearly can't even analyze the markets in real time. A pitiful fleecing of the public with outrageous claims in the book and at her site."
2,inseparable companion,"In this book, Connie presents and indicator which she claims is an ""inseparable companion"" to the RSI.In my mind, this book itself is an inseparable companion to John Hayden's RSI book. Following on John Hayden's footsteps, who renamed Cardwell's positive and negative reversals, as Hayden's MDRPs (momentum discrepancy reversal points), Connie has made an identical copy of Cardwell's CFG indicator, renamed it as the Composite Index, and claimed it as her own ""after much expense and hard work""After all the nagging and bragging in the book about not giving out her secret indicator formula, it turns out that the formula is not even hers."
1,Channelling P.T. Barnum,"Caveat emptor would be an understatement.Trading should be based on facts, not faith. The author has no publicly available or documented track record. (Check Managed Account Reports, the CFTC, etc.) The book itself offers few algorithms, fewer coded systems, and no backtested results.Isolated, hand-picked illustrations do not count. In this business, beware the well-chosen example.Perhaps you are still willing to overlook the lack of empirical proof. Are some of her trading concepts even logically coherent? No. For example, Gann methodology fails William Eckhardt's ""c-test"" (See a back issue of the magazine, ""Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities"").We are not talking about the author's intentions, motivations, or character here. Only verifiable results, or the lack thereof.As such, the book is an excercise in rhetoric, not reality."
5,Excellent Book - But you must be literate and have an IQ over 100,"Ms. Brown's book on technical analysis is superb. It has increased my profits already after just reading it two weeks ago.If you are serious about making money in the stock market, you will have to ignore some of the stupid reviews of this book... the ones written by the same type of illiterates who write profane messages on the stock message boards and have trouble stringing a sentence together.This book is aimed at people who can read. And who are ready to actually work at making money on the market.The mindless masses who want a quick fix or a ""magic pill"" are never going to understand this book. But it's a GEM. Highly recommended."
5,Eye opening.,"Ms. Brown gives you a new way to look at the old indicators. The very first chapter on the Bull/Bear ranges with the RSI has given me the ability to look at charts and determine, with better accuracy, what the market will do next. There have been a few reviewers who seem to be left hanging because Ms. Brown doesn't reveal each and every formula that she uses. That would be giving away her trading system. I wouldn't either. For as much time as she puts into this I wouldn't just hand it out. Trading is a continuous learning process. Ms. Brown leaves it up to you to adapt and rework the tools you already use to fit your trading style. When finding a system there is a great amount of experimentation that goes along with it, this book encourages that."
4,Fresh Perspectives,"The author certainly has something to offer in this book. Yet,the book does not seem to be well edited and presented. Commas are missing.There are no sub-headings. These making reading not too interesting.The ideas presented are from an unconventional perspective. As anexample, not taking spikes for trendlines may not be true all the time.It depends on the situation and this takes experience."
2,Where's the beef?,"I am very surprised to see such glowing comments from other readers. Some friends of mine and I all thought the book a waste of time. The first section on the RSI was well-written and well thought out. It contains new and interesting information. The rest of the book looks like it was thrown in for filler in haste. I tried to use the RSI information in my trading, but found it of limited use."
4,Good quality but a bit small,"Ordered this for a Sony MiniDV Handycam Digital Camcorder with 2.5"" Swivelscreen LCD monitor. This is a very small camcorder so I didn't want a huge bag and this one looked just about perfect. Well, it is just about perfect for the camcorder but I failed to think about storing cables and disks. I can BARELY squeeze everything in there but that's my fault for not thinking ahead. Just remember to take into account your extra accesories before you choose a camera bag."
5,Perfect Compact,"Very compact. Perfect if traveling light. But if you are looking for a bag to carry all of your accessories, look elsewhere."
4,Decent Value,"Bought it for my Sony DCR-SR40 30GB HDD, as I'm about to take a trip abroad. It serves its purposes - it's not big enough to fit both the camcorder and the charger mount and cable (best to leave those in my backpack or luggage at the hotel - I have no need of them as I'm wandering about to do the touristy thing anyway), but it's still big enough to fit both the camcorder in the main pouch, as well as an average-sized digital camera in the front pouch."
2,Not so happy...,"This case is so small that I can't realistically store my extra battery, an extra DV tape, and the DV tape case that is in the camera, let alone the small charger, the firewire cable, and a handful of tapes. I didn't expect to keep it all in the small bag but a little more room was expected. So I bought a larger bag and I keep my camera in the small bag and the small bag in the large bag with all the stuff. That way I can use the small bag when I am out and about and the larger bag stays in the trunk of the car or wherever."
3,"Nothing wrong about it, small, compact and fits the camera....","Nothing wrong about it, small, compact and fits the camera....But it doesn't fit accessories you may to carry... At max, you can carry the battery and couple of cables in it... If that's your requirement (having it compact), it's great."
2,no for all camcorders,this case is not for the handycam dhc. its to big for the camera alone but not big enough for accessories.
2,Sony Soft Carrying Case,Returned this item to Amazon as it was too small for much of anything other than the camera. Felt the price was way too high for what I was getting in a carrying case.
3,small bag,"This carrying case is small, I have a Sony HDR-SR7 and it fits ok with the regular battery but if you use the more powerfull bigger battery the case barely closes, you have to force the zipper to close. You can keep the other battery in the front pocket but there is no space for cables."
5,Sony LCS-VAC Soft Carrying Case,Great Sony quality product. I bought two of these bags two years ago. I am using one bag to hold a Sony DCR-82 Handycam. The other bag holds an Olympus C-770 Ultra Zoom 10X digital camera. Both bags are very high quality and do the job. I highly recommend the bag for your camera needs.
5,Luxury,Carrying the Handy-cam wasn't easy without this.Just love it.I tuck my cam-corder in it and move around anywhere i want to.Great Buy
3,Slightly bigger...,"I found this case to be slightly bigger.. not as compact as I thought it was.. as there was still some space left after I put the camcorder in it.. However the extra space can be used to put batteries, lenses, etc.."
1,Item never received,"I have never received this item. I received the charger and the movie, but not the case. Please check this out. Request the case or refund of money for the case and shipping costs."
5,Love this story.,"I loved how Ms. Lamb has expanded on the four sisters in her books. This one is especially good because Angnes is the type of women we would all like to be in one way or another. The love story between her and the doctor is funny, frustrating, infuriating and wonderful and makes you want to keep reading. I have all her books and can't wait for the next. If you want romance from the heart, here it is."
4,Hot water heater element replacementelement,"This element is easy to screw into your old element's bung, requires a large socket that most people do not own. the socket can be ""borrowed"" from most Auto part stores. It is a ""shorty"" element, not very long but works nicely. That is why I only gave it 4 stars."
5,The Colored Museum rates well.,"It's a satire with plenty of humor, featuring a series of Museum Exhibits (or theatre playlets) drawn from the African American past and it's adversity."
3,The Land and The Book,I didn't find this book easy to navigate. It is wordy and not always straight to the point. It isn't easy to find specific information quickly. It is thorough and has a lot of detail.
3,Geography vs. Inerrancy,"""The Land and the Book"" is an excellent resource for those who wish to relate the Holy Bible to the geography of the Holy Land. Two irritants were the constant referencing to the politically correct BCE and CE (instead of BC and AD). On page 114 the author states, "" ... nor can one be certain that the story found in Luke 2 is historically reliable."" and ""Luke mentions Bethsaida specifically in relation to the miracle, but no one can be certain where it took place."" In summary: Geography 4 Stars. Belief in accuracy of Bible: 0 Stars."
2,Fiskars Ratcheting Anvil Pruner,"Works fine on branches 1/2 inch or less. It is rated to 3/4 inch, but branches much over 1/2 inch it became hard to get it to ratchet and the blades tended to bend. My pruner handle gave out after one summer of use. Fiskars has yet to respond to my request regarding weather they will be replacing it under its ""life time warranty."""
1,Broken Promises,"After only a couple of months of use, the flimsy handle broke.It didn't always ratchet either!"
2,broke the first time out,"I got about 20 minutes of use out of this and I was just thinking that it was doing really well for the price, when it broke in two going through a 1/2"" piece of ivy.On closer inspection, the middle is made of plastic. It should really be metal. It turns out the ratcheting mechanism gives more torque than the handle can take.It might be good for cutting flowers or something, but don't rely on it for bigger jobs even though it says it is good up to 3/4""."
3,Don't make them like they used to.....,"I purchased these to replace a like pair that I lost to divorce.I loved that first pair and thought these were identical. Unfortunately, Fiskars seems to have lowered their quality in the last 7 years.I still like Fiskars and I like these pruners. However, they are made in China and you should probably go for the cheaper, no name brand that admits to being made in China."
1,Should've known better...,"I had a cheap pair of ratchet anvil pruners I was replacing that lasted several years. But I should've known better than to buy another plastic one. This broke the first cut on a branch no bigger than a half inch - really. And, no, it wasn't iron wood. Better stick with loppers or bypass clippers. I'll read up on other Fiskar products before buying again."
1,Lasted less than an hour,"It worked great until the handle broke. This is definitely a light-duty tool. Unfortunately, the package advertising leads you to believe that it can be used for larger chores."
2,FIskars anvil pruner - Not!,It looked like a good tool but I find that it doesn't have the opening I need and doesn't work as well as the $5.00 anvil pruner I found at the hardware store.
3,"Outstanding design, variable quality",I purchased two Fiskars Ratchet Anvil Pruners. One failed almost immediately due to a crack in the molded plastic housing. The other one has proven to be rugged and effective in cutting grape vines almost 1 inch thick.
1,cheap and lasted one round of rose clipping,Do not buy this product. it is cheap plastic and will break very easily. Most Fiskar products are higher quality than this one.
1,"One good cut of a 1/4"" and it went downhill fast!","I bought these pruners to cut 1/4"" strips of wood for a kayak I am building. The first cut was amazing! Clean cut, perfectly true, and very easy. The second cut worked, but took several attempts. It was clear that the ratchet was only wokring some of the time. After 5 cuts, the plastic handle broke! I never applied more than the pressure exerted by one hand squeezing the handles, and I am a 65 year-old retired desk worker, not a 25 year-old pro tennis player with a grip of steel!"
2,Poor Quality,"The pruners were able to cut small to medium size single branches, but if your trying to cut more than one piece at a time the gear releases. If you need to cut anything over one-half of an inch or old hardened wood, don't try it. I did and the cheaply made plastic handle broke. Also the cutting blade is loosely fit and will turn to one side or the other when trying to cut anything heavier than a twig."
1,Junk! Avoid! Broke after only one use!!!,Was using it to cut my very first branch and the thing snapped! Complete junk. Would not recommend it to anyone. Thankfully Amazon let me return for a complete refund. The manufacturer should not make a tool like this out of plastic!
2,Flimsy NOT FOR THICK BRANCHES,"I found that the shears bend and twist if you attempt to cut a branch at an angle under 50 degree instead of a straight 90 degree to the branch. of course this is not a problem with very small branches, best for flower stems etc"
2,Fiskars Ratchet Pruner,"I have found these awkward to use: large for small hands; they don't open far enough to get around average sized stems or branches; and they lock constantly, necessitating several squeezes to open again. Sorry I bought it, plus I bought a pair I gave as a gift."
4,"Most Dictionaries Don't Have the Word ""Copyediting""...","As the back cover of the book explains, the word ""copyediting"" doesn't appear in most dictionaries. And it is both an art and science to be able to capably copyedit writing. So why is it almost unknown, both literally and figuratively?Well, as a friend of the author says, ""...I see my job as making my work invisible."" Copyediting is the art and science of preparing written work for publication. The copyeditor will check for any and all types of errors that might be found in text, including making sure the facts stated are correct. If the copyeditor has done his or her job correctly, you'll never realize they were there.It's a tough discipline and it requires exactly that-discipline. This book does an excellent job of covering the ins-and-outs of copyediting, making it a valuable tool for writers and editors alike. Anyone who writes for a living or hopes to do so wuold do well to read this book."
1,Copyediting: A Practical Guide,"This book is an absolute rip-off. Do not waste your money. It is riddled with mistakes and contradictions. I caught several mistakes in the final ""test"" at the end of the book. In this key section, Ms. Judd had the titles of The Columbia Journalism Review and The New York Times wrong, and those weren't the only errors. Such sloppiness in a copyediting book is outrageous! Also, if you are interested in proofreading, there is almost nothing here for you. This woman is a fraud! As I said, save your money. Get the style and usage manuals, and study them yourself."
3,Very dated,"I'm sure when this book came out it was a great source for editing and proofreading but with the current market certain aspects just don't ring true. Computers have changed the face of editing that this book just doesn't address. Granted it does have some good suggestions but I really found nothing here that I didn't already know. If you have any idea about editing I would suggest skipping the book. If you want to just learn the basics I would still suggest finding something a little newer. On the whole, it just isn't worth the money."
3,Good but dated,"Certainly worth the 4 dollars, INCLUDING shipping, that I paid for it. Excellent book but old, and thus out of date in places. Good cheap buy for someone who has never copy-edited before and is interested in what it is and how it works."
2,Beware of Ritek Made TDK CD-Rs,I've always preferred TDK media over other brands but lately they've been selling CD-Rs made by RITEK in Taiwan which are quite ordinary and not as good as regular TDK made CD-Rs. I recommend looking for Made in USA TDK CD-Rs.
1,LETDOWN,"I bought this movie and in spite of having the great Jesper Chritensen in one of the roles....I could not get past the LOW production quailty from the sound, to the cheap film transfer and boring beginning.Don't waste your time. Sorry, but it is mediocre and just because Mankell fans such as myself are starved for his material stateside, we cannot pretend this is good to quench our collective thirsts. Lets just be honest! It sucks!"
1,"Photography too dark, plot nothing like the novel","For those who have read the novel The White Lioness and are expecting a faithful adaptation, this movie is not for you. While it is understandable that many times plots are rewritten for film, the sudden change of the assasination attempt from South Africa to Norway is confusing to me. The photography of the film leaves much to be desired too. The lighting is simply too dark, making it almost impossible to see the faces of the many black characters in this film. I've seen movies from Scandinavia better made than this one. If you want a good suspensful Scandinavian movie, try Insomnia instead."
4,Triumph of the robot spirit,"This movie is great in a horrendously cheesy, yet beautiful way - it is a triumph of the human (robot) spirit. Poor ol' Johnny 5 comes to the big city, open eyed and pure and is beaten down and taken advantage of. The classic struggle between hope and idealism vs. the often dreary and dissapointing realities. But yes, one glorious spirit is capable of awakening the lost hope in others and emerging victorious."
4,Johnny 5 is great!,"Johnny 5 is a great character, but the sequel didn't measure up to the original as far as support charachters."
4,DVD Short Circuit 2,"The DVD came very fast. Seem that the DVD not from the original, but came out good. I'm very pleased to order item with Amazon."
5,"""I'm perfectly K-O""","For once, the sequel is better than the original! Johnny 5 is the most lovable robot ever!!! Ben is the most lovable creator of the most lovable robot! And Fred is the most lovable creep! Fisher Stevens is even better this time around. This sequel has an added hugeness of humor to it thanks to the addition of Michael McKean (so much for that $50 silk shirt, huh?). If you saw the original, you HAVE TO see this!!! BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!!!!!"
3,"it's ok,","The movie worked, and is nice cover and cd. Thanks. Worth the money paid for it. The movie is a good movie."
5,Movies,This is a great movie I use to watch as a kid. So I thought I should buy it for the whole family...
