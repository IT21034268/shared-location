2,Misleading,"On the back of the box it says it showcases every NBA Finals from 1979 to 2004. Where is the 1979 Finals between the Sonics and Bullets? Also this is a re-hash of the highlight tapes released in the late 80's that are still being released today.In the 76ers/Bulls/Laker/Celtics Dynasty Series complete games are shown, why couldnt they at the very least show some complete clinching games from those years?"
5,Great little eye mask !,If you have sinus problems or are sensitive to light you will love this. Even without freezing or refrigerating it offers a nice cooling effect when you put it on.
1,Look for alternatives,"This phone seemed like it would meet my needs for an affordable, simple phone with answering machine. I've tried it for two weeks, and I'm disappointed by the sound quality - I've left messages that I later found out the other party could not hear, and I get requests to speak louder.Annoyingly, you cannot switch between speaker and regular mode while talking. I'm returning it to the store."
1,Worst phone ever owned,"My husband and I wanted to purchase a new phone since we were moving into a new home and had more space. This was our first expandable handset and it will be our last. We don't know if it's our phone that was built with a ""bug"" in it but the conversation is always full of static (and we have taken the proper precautions to house them away from other electronic devises). 8 out of 10 times if you pick up the phone to dial out you won't have a dial tone and you will receive a message that says ""unavailable""-you then have to wait 30-60 seconds to try again. This will also happen when you go to answer an incoming call. Since I operate a home-based business this is not an option for me so we are replacing these phones. Save yourself the hassle of ""you may get a good one, you may not"" and go for a simpler phone. The store we purchased them at was discontinuing them...I wonder why."
3,"Not bad, but missing one feature.","Wife and I got this phone. It has all the normal bells and whistles, only missing one thing. You can't do a conference call with two handsets. Only one handset can talk at once, and if you want to transfer it to another one, you press a button. But you both can't talk at the same time."
4,Using for home business line - no complaints,"I think this is a great value for the price. I just started a business from home and wanted to keep expenses low. I saw the previous comment on bad reception but i called my phone carrier and they told me that through digital service, that is not an issue. Also, a note on switching from speaker to normal... you have to press talk again during the conversation NOT speaker (it automatically hangs up). You can not operate more than one handset at a time, however, i know of many pricey phones that work the same way. I use the phone with a headset and have never had any issues on clarity and call drops. One issue I haven't figured out... my Memory List keeps re-setting itself."
1,Boring!!!!,"The book really didn't grab or hold my attention. The arthur spoke A LOT about her relationship with him prior to him going to jail and that was boring!! Women being in that situation want to read about the struggles, trials & tribulations you go through once their man goes to jail, not a romance novel about someone elses relationship and how they met.Maybe she got into that later in the book (I don't know) because I didn't get that far. I was tired of reading what seemed to me to be your average romance novel and just couldn't take anymore so I didn't pick the book back up. I normally keep all my book purchases and rarely lend them out (afraid of not getting them back or the book not coming back in the same condition) but I quickly mailed this out to someone who was interested in reading it and if she doesn't send it back trust me, I won't be upset nor miss the book at all!!"
4,Worth Reading .. overpriced,"There are only a few books on FX trading in Amazon, none are quite in depth, this would be a better or the best one available already.At least it has 2 chapters covering some strategies and chart readings unique to FX, it also has a little coverage on how stop huntings are used by market makers; but the rest of the books are on fundamentals, for first timers.I believe FX is more than Technical & Fundamental, how those FX market makers manipulate the rates is the key, and things that most of us don't understand. This and other books just don't cover.It is overpriced, comparing with other more classic investment books that cost only half. Sure sometimes you cannot value a book like this, if one or two points in the book ring a bell to you, it worths a thousands times more."
3,Very fundamental outlook,"This book talks about many aspects of the market from a fundamental overview. Kathy tends to focus on a very broad spectrum, touching on details in an obscured light. I personally find the technical analysis of the book lagging. She shows few examples, but a lot of it, you're left to digest on your own. Overall, this book is ok for beginners, but some prior knowledge of forex market is definitely required in order to understand her observations."
2,Not so useful!,"In my search for good FX trading books, I found no good book yet, and this book is no exception. This book is poorly written, has no consistent flow, and it does not lead the reader anywhere. Just few areas I found somewhat interesting like correlation between pairs, and volatility as a function of time of the day, and that is why I gave it a rating of 2. Otherwise, 1 will be enough. Someday someone may write a good FX trading book that really respects the intelligence of the reader. Not all FX retail traders are losers!"
2,Superficial at best...,I just finished reading this book and after reading more than a dozen of books on forex and day trading I must say the book is a waste of money. Most of the topics in the book are covered superficially and the few trading strategies presented are poorly documented and contain errors.
2,Would have been good if the Internet didn't exist,"There seems to be a lot of forex books out there. When some people want to get rich on forex others exploit the opportunity by selling books the traders. This is such a book.The book deals with both technical and fundamental analysis. Both parts are covered on a very superficial level. That is what happens if everything is included in one fairly slim book.The book contains some bits of information, because the author seems to be knowledgable. But the overall impression is not very strong. This might be a decent book if you knew absolutely nothing about forex. But then again, with the Internet around you don't need a book like this one."
4,great introduction to forex,"Great book. the only thing i thought could of made it better, was more strategies to implement. kathy includes a couple to wet the taste buds, though i wanted a few more to try out straight away. other than that, it's the perfect introduction to the foundations of the forex market and what makes it tick, which everyone looking into trading this market needs to know.you can't go wrong getting this book. highly recommend.- Jay v. Australia"
3,Good read,The book provides basic information on currency markets day trading. Enjoyed reading the book and recommend reading it before trading.
4,Very informative book,"This book enlightened me on many fronts of Forex Trading. It gave me ideas for a trading plan and a daily action sheet. It also helped me a lot in the area of fundamental analysis, like what to consider with a list of items and web pages I can use.I would definitely recommend this book."
3,Good for newbies,"I am a bit disappointed from the fact that part of this book is just reprint from previously published FXCM course, but overall it's a good reference for people that are in the beginning of their trading career. Kathy also describes several technical strategies for specific situations, but they do not constitute complete trading system. If you know what carry trade, CPI or PPI is, then you probably already know what this book is trying to explain."
3,an excellent very preliminary introduction to fx trading,"Kathy Lien, once a forex trader at JP Morgan, has written an excellent introduction to the world of forex day trading. The rave reviews the book has received notwithstanding, I don't think this book is anywhere near detailed enough for anyone to get a grasp of the topic sufficient to allow prudent decisions to be made. There simply is not enough detail. Macroeconomic considerations are not described in sufficient detail; the exercises are of simple best case scenarios; the significance and meaning of statistics and stochastics are not explained.On the other hand, if you don't have a clue what the forex market is about, this book is a very unchallenging - and from the perspective of a newcomer - quite informative book about the forex markets."
3,Good for Starters,"Purchased this book, along with Boris Scholossberg's book, ""Technical Analysis of the Currency Market"" (both authors are with FXCM).As an intermediate trader I found both books good for the beginner, especially in conveying the big picture for news trading. Helpful, but not enough to inspire competence and confidence.As for actual trading techniques I found the book lacking. Mr. Schlossberg's book was more useful in that regard, but still by no means exhaustive, covering only a small number of indicators and techniques.There's no doubt this book has value to the beginning trader, but I personally think it is important that newbies go online to review sites [...] to get recommendations from other traders for the fastest, and best possible forex education."
4,Worth Reading,"I saw the author speak in Houston and I was impressed with her. By that time I had been trading forex for about a year and a half. That first year was a very expensive tuition.When I saw the book, I was provoked to buy it simply because of my high regard for the author and to further glean tools and techniques to enhance my trading.It was a good read, though very much a primer for the novice. This book should be viewed as a beginning to the reading and research a currency trader needs in order to be successful. One will come away from reading this book not with the specfic knowledge one needs to trade successfully, but instead with a direction one needs to take to advance one's skills."
3,"Dummies 101. Too simple and ""Fundamental Analysis"" biased for FX day trading","I agree with most reviewers that this is an easy read covering most of the basic topics, primarily fundamental/economic factors, of the FX market. However, the author had painted too simple and macro a picture of the harsh/choppy day trading environment in which it is very difficult to make money. Little had been discussed on Technical Analysis tools at all on how to avoid the ""traps"" or ""false breakouts"" so prevalent nowadays. Sorry to comment that this book resembles more a marketing/briefing material from the highly aggressive FXCM than anything else. For those who already have an acceptable understanding of FX and read to sharpen his/her trading edge, I strongly recommend ""High Probability trading by Marcel Link"" ."
4,Good,A good book but I would have liked to see more on longer-term currency trading techniques involving methods that forecast currency rates based upon global economic trends.
1,LESS THAN SIX MONTHS,"i PURCHASED THESE SHOES FROM MACY'S AND THE SHOE FELT AND LOOKED GREAT, WHATS A LIFE EXPECTANCY OF A SHOE? 6 MONTHS,1YR, 2YRS? WELL THEY ONLY LASTED ME 6 MONTHS AND THE WOOD COLOR ON THE BOTTOM WAS GONE IN 2 WEEKS. I SPENT 80.00 ON THEM BACK THEN. THEY ARE ONLY 10 BUCKS CHEAPER ONLINE...I BET YOU CAN FIND A BETTER SHOE THAT LOOKS AS NICE FOR CHEAPER PRICE..I'D RATHER BUY A REAL SHOE FOR 80.00...THE SOLE IS GONE ON THE SHOE.. DON'T BUY UNLESS WANT TO BUY ANOTHER PAIR SIX MONTHS LATER....EDDIEP.S. DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,the quantities are off,"I new to cooking, and I find that the recipes had odd quantities for ingrediants. A recipe will call for 10 oz. and the products is only sold in 14 oz I have a hard time know what to do with the other 4 oz. or the recipe will call for 10 oz and I have to buy 2 - 8oz cans to make the recipe not too wild about this book"
3,Okay,"For me this was pretty much what I cook anyway..may be better for others. I like more simple variation, no real prep time"
3,Incomplete Nutritional Information,"The authors have the nutritional values calculated for as many as 20 servings yet fail to provide the serving sizes. They have to figure out the size of a serving to calculate the information, so why not include that with the recipe so we, who must count our carbohydrates for insulin purposes for example, don't have to dirty dishes to dish out the entire crock pot. There are authors out there who care enough about their readers to provide this information."
1,Dishes High in Carbs!,"Though the dishes look ""yummy"" most are very high in carbs. As a ""Diabetic"" cookbook, I was expecting dishes low (as well as very low) in carbs. The very first recipe my eyes landed on has 43 carbs per serving and only 3 grams of fiber. Yikes! I have another book by the same author, Fix It and Forget It Lightly, and most of the recipes are exactly the same with dietary exchanges added. I'm really sorry I spent money on this book. If you need to be careful with carb intake, skip this one."
1,Encourages poor health habits,"If you're diabetic you want to bring your cholesterol down so you don't want to have tons of meat and fat as this book suggests. Also, many of the recipes contain sugar or sugar substitute which are extremely bad for diabetics. I am shocked that this book was published by the American Diabetic Society. People need to eat well and healthily, exercise and bring the weight down. I would suggest if you're diabetic, you do some research on your own unless your doctor is pretty progressive. There's a lot of great books out there but this isn't one of them in my opinion."
1,how do you call it a Diabetic cookbook when the recipies have SUGAR in them!!!,Why they get away with calling it a Diabetic cookbook when the recipies are loaded with sugar I HAVE NO IDEA!!!
1,Yikes!,"This is a great concept, but terrible execution. These recipes may be easy, they may fit in the ADA guidelines, but they're scary. My recommendation: keep looking."
2,didn't buy the book,"after reading the reviews I decided not to purchase the book.I need a low carb, low salt, low fat diabetic cookbook that doesn't base its recipes on canned soups and noodles . NOt giving proper portion counts and calorie counts also made this a no buy book."
5,To Soon To Tell!,"Cook book looks good with interesting recipes, however I have not had it long enough to actually review it (which Amazon has asked me to do at this time)."
5,YUMMM YUMMMM !,"This cook book has so many GOOD recipies it's hard to decide what to cook next ! I like the varied assortment and I've learned alot of new cooking skills with my slow cooker. With winter fast approaching , warm meals ready when I get home from work are a bonus. This is my third Fix-it & Forget-it cook book , so I'm a fan ! Much thanks & God bless :-)"
2,"the ""new"" Diabetic rules","Many doctors are now just telling diabetics to basically just eat what they want but to account for it and take the right amount of insulin. This is because so many patients today will not comply with a actual diabetic diet. As this disaease runs rampant in my family and my husbands I see why this is being done. My father in law lost his leg and still eats with no regaurd to his blood sugar. IN fact he was give desert and pinnapple at the same meal in the hospital after his amputation, resulting in a 300 level.This cookbook if fine for this type of diabeties managment. However if your looking to lose wieght and manage your blook sugar with diet this won't cut it."
3,"Good to have, nothing much new","This is much the same as any other of the Fix-it and Forget-it books. You have the 2 things you need in all of them, serving size and total carbs. Presumably, there are more lower carb entries, but I can't say that for certain., as yet."
3,diabetic cook book,I don't much care for this book. for those who want to try and have their cake and eat it to.......I guess it's great. I'm trying to control my diabetes not cheat around it trying to get my sweet fix in spite of the diabetes.
4,Good,"This is a good product, with one exception....it would be nice to have a bigger variety of recipes. I was very pleased with the addition of information about the condition of Diabetes...lots of answered questions and vital information for anyone who has diabetes or who is wanting to prevent developing diabetes. The book was in very good condition and arrived in a timely manner."
4,good basic slow cooker recipes,"My dau-in-law is diabetic and this new cookbook has helped me prepare the proper meal. She is at my home at least once a week, and she has also purchased this book as a basic slow cooker reference."
5,Great Recipes,"On Monday nights, we have family dinner at our apt. and I am always making crock pot dinners! My husband has diabetes and I needed recipes that were not only good for him but delicious for everyone else! Fix It and Forget It-Diabetic Coodbook was the answer I was looking for. It has great recipes that are good for hubby and that also taste good for the entire family. Everyone has enjoyed the recipes that I make from this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who needs easy crock pot recipes for diabetics and anyone else."
5,Terrific Stuff,"This is a wonderful live album, acoustic but still chunky and funky. The collaboration with John Paul Jones is brilliant, and it really shows off Ann Wilson's voice to its very best advantage. One of those concert albums that really makes you wish you'd been there."
5,"Heart's TRUE sound, pure & sweet","I actually saw the video of this acoustic concert first and it was heaven. The raw, true, energy, and soul of Ann Wilson is just gold; Ann and Nancy together again in this 1995 event is spectacular. An absolute must for any and all who appreciate the true sound of music and love HEART."
1,NOT recomended,"this CD had the 3 songs by Heart that I really like, Alone, All I Wanna Do is Make Love to You, and These Dreams. However they are slowed down majorly and do not sound nearly as good as they do on the other CDs, I was quite dissapointed (listen to the clip from alone to see what I'm talking about, definetly do this before buying)"
2,Not pleased,"The bracelet is not what I expected. I was getting the bracelet to go with a black stoned sterling silver ring I have. The bracelet looks like costume jewelry, it is not something you would wear with a nice piece of jewelry. I have not returned it, because I hate going to the trouble of doing it."
5,"Add this book to your ""Must Read List""","I pre-ordered the book and was anxiously (and impatiently) awaiting its release. It was delivered about a week ago and after reading the first few chapters, I knew it was clearly worth the wait. Not only is it an easy read, but it has already sparked more ideas that I ever would have imagined (or could manage this year) on how to engage our clients in a relevant and meaningful way. The tools that John and Tamara have included in this book will help spark the creativity you need to develop innovative new ways to improve the overall customer experience."
2,This book makes prayer seem like God is a genie,"I was asked to read this book (along with several others from this author), by a friend. I am a Christian who holds a Biblical worldview and found this book to be interesting in many ways, but off the mark in some ways too. If you have a strong Bible background...you can sift the wheat from the chaff in this book and the Spirit will certainly speak through it. If not, I suggest you run from it and don't allow this into your head. There is a lot of metaphysical stuff and prosperity teaching in this book as well as all of his others that I've read. Not a true picture of Christianity or of the Gospel message."
4,Must-Read for the Newbie,"Jeff and his team write well. Surprise. Look for the consistencies amongst the various agents' opinions on how best to make a proposal or write your query, and you'll have your A game recipe.Better assistance for non-fiction than fiction. Of course. Fiction submissions require you to have a manuscript. Remember, publishers/agents are buying/buying into your _writing_, not your hype-quotient, and certainly not your photograph. Thus, the best assistance for your fiction submission is to get assistance in writing great fiction. Rightly, you will not find this addressed in this book - try John Gardner instead!All in all, very useful. One wish: a more complete listing of agents in the appendices."
2,Out-dated information,"I purchased the latest edition of this which was titled, 2001-2002 edition. A more fitting title would be the ""1999 Writer's Guide"" I write to people who have been gone for two to three years....and their publishing houses are writing nasty letters back to me complaining about my outdated information.This book is shoddy work that is not helping my efforts as a writer. Listing people who have been gone for two-three years and titling the book as current is both unprofessional and unconscionable. It is pretty clear to me that the cover of this book was changed while everything inside stayed the same...a real scam and a disservice to writers.My warning to writers is to check every listing before sending out your query letters or proposals....getting the wrong name on your query letter is a quick way to the trash file."
5,A must if you like slap stick comedy!,"If you want to laugh til you cry.... If you want to enjoy slapstick comedy at its best... Oui, vous l'avez trouvee... c'est ce film."
2,Memoires of a Geisha,"A western story--Cinderella--dressed up in Geisha clothing. The story was predictable, and sadly, filled with a lot of female back-biting. The Japanese details were somewhat interesting."
3,dinnerware dog set,"this item was ok, it was broken 2 times before i actually got to use it. i thought it would be more durable but its not. i guess if you want it for something pretty then its good but for something that actually works for a running around little dog then its not good."
1,Disappointed,I live in europe and can not view any of the movies. Who can I talk to to return all the movies?
1,pap,unreadable. the worst biography of celine available in english. read anything else. unless you happen to enraptured by the biographers feelings. the information available in this could be covered in fifty pages. If I knew I was going to live forever I would still still resent the theft of my time this book represents. read Hewitt or McCarthy.t. linn
2,Not for fine art photography,I was disappointed with the quality of this paper. It is not heavy enough for the size of the prints and as a result warps when matted and framed. I would not recommend this product to anyone who is serious about displaying his or her photography.
1,Epson Premium Luster Photo Paper,"NOT A VERY GOOD TRANSACTION.The company shipped the wrong item, Then it took too long to receive a refund, I shipped back the goods paying myself for the shipping and when I got the refund, the amount was less than the amount charged."
1,Ultimate?,"Tell prospective buyers that most of this is a live recording. If you want the real thing, don't buy this. For me it was a waste of time and money."
4,"Boost Reading Confidence With This One - a review of ""I Am""","This is a cute little book for very beginning readers. Vocabulary, though varied, is simple. The hardest words are: short, shout, white, black, and laugh. Other words would include: am, are, big, do, down, go and I, etc.The drawings are simple but cute and they amply show a variety of children with their many attributes. There are black and white children, Asian children, children with casts on their arms and in a wheelchair, and children that are laughing and shouting. The book is basically all about contrasts such as big and small, short and tall, in and out, say and do, up and down.Four Stars. [B]. A good book to boost reading confidence. Vocabulary is simple. Sentences are very short. The drawings give plenty of visual clues to remind children of what any new words might be."
3,M.I.A. - Galang '05,"M.I.A. has a lot of hype to live up to, but GALANG is one of the reasons she can do it. The Dave Kelly mix goes a little more towards India than is probably necessary, and the ragga chanting from Cham isn't adding much either. The original is the way to go."
4,"Great song, decent remix.","For anyone who has ever heard M.I.A., they know that she is brilliant and her music is probably some of the most infectious stuff out there. ""Galang"" was her debut single and it turned everybody's heads. It is one of the catchiest songs ever made.The remix on here is decent, but it really doesn't have too much M.I.A. on it. Just the guest artist Cham.But overall, this single is good. But I wouldn't reccomend buying it for $12. I got mine at Tower for $5. Much better for a two track single."
4,Fun game,"Rat-A-Tat is a fun game. I think it will become more fun as my 5 year old gets older, though, as we are only into the basics of the game. It is an enjoyable game for adults to play with children as well, a nice alternative to other kids' card games."
4,"Great game, however consider the original version","My nine year old loves this game and I enjoy it, too. However, this version has ""super peek"" which allows you to look at the back of the cards in play with a red plastic film and learn what they all are if you draw the ""super peek"". We have found that manufacturer did not do a good enough job in disguising the hidden identities on the card backs. Thus, even without the super peek decoder, it is possible to determine the identities of the cards. This makes it hard not to cheat.I would recommend the original version which does not include the super peek. My advice to the manufacturer would be to come up with a better obscuring technique if you wish to keep the super peek."
4,"Need to change card ""super peek""","Shown this game at a family reunion, loved it and had to get one. Unfortunately manufacturer has added ""Super Peek"" feature with card values imprinted on card face, these values are easily read without use of red glases and someone can ""cheat"" by knowing value of cards.Recommend manufacturer eliminate this and go back to original format, otherwise you will have to block face printing to eliminate clue to values.Fun game to play for all ages!!! To bad on the distraction05/15/2009 follow up - manufacturer sending replacement deck without super peek, very positive customer support!Tom Lupfer"
4,"Great game, but I think I like the original better...","This game is almost as fun as the original. My daughters love Rat-A-Tat Cat, so when I saw this edition, I bought it. The SuperPeek feature is exclusive to this edition, and while the girls like it, it seems a bit ""gimmick-y"" and I don't think it improves the game. On the other hand, that could be because I just got beaten twice in a row by them, and they drew SuperPeek cards and I didn't! All in all, lots of fun in a game that only take about 10-15 minutes to play - good for quick quality time!"
5,Great Logic game,"My kids received this game for Christmas two years ago when they were 6 and 3. To this day it remains one of our favorite games. I love it because it requires all of us to test our memory and use logic to win. It's also quick to play -- most games take less than ten minutes. We all enjoy it, and the kids love trying to get rid of all the rats and trap everyone else with lots of points. If you're looking for a simple game that has educational components, then try this one. It's a winner!"
3,Comfortably hip,"This is very comfortable however I took away 2 stars because after several wear the seams on the front tore apart. The first time I've put 'em on, I couldn't zip the front zipper although it is true to size. The tear wasn't near the zipper. I've expected it to be durable but that is not true."
4,An impressive debut,"The Black Sea's debut EP, S/T, is a fantastic sampler of the band. Although the EP is short, only three songs, it speaks volumes for the talent of the band. The EP starts off with Ghost Lanterns, a rollicking rocker with a pounding beat and great bass work. Shelby Cinca's voice is soft, and yet conveys enormous power over the track, as well as the other two songs. Landscapes follows Ghost Lanterns and is more subdued and lyrically focused in nature. Once again, the rhythm section mixes perfectly with the guitar and vocals for an eery, somewhat psychedelic rocker. The final track, Wingless Fire, features fantastic acoustic guitar work and beautiful vocals with a somewhat Indian or Eastern feel to it.All in all, a great EP, although a bit short. Very highly recommended."
2,not durable,"I had loved it at first, but I am one to leave a necklace on forever. It started to get all kinked up and I couldn't figure out how to straighten it out. But the company did offer me a discount on a different chain, even though it was past their 30 day policy. Nice for once in a while wearing and be careful when handling it."
3,Omega Chain Wire,"The chain wire fits comfortably and is of good quality. It is less strong than I thought and so I cannot wear all my pendants. The fastener also takes a little getting used to. Still, it is good value for the money."
1,Not what I thought,Not what I thought it would be. I shipped it right back. Doesn't even lay on your chest. Its more like a stiff wire.
4,"very sexy, strong and fun spirited","""Wonderful"" is perhaps one of the most honest, romantic love songs ever written (without the mush!) The lyrics are poetic and true to so many lives. Various other tracks are catchy and somewhat campy- but that is what makes them so fun and great. This man is so full of feeling with everything he does, you can't help but love him. I should give it 5 stars because of the ""wonderful"" track. I love this CD, and I would recommend Kings of the Wild Frontier and any other early recordings. He had the finese of Morrison-like poetry in the early 80's. Adam, Marco, if you ever read this...please keep up the great work. I would love to hear another CD!"
5,"Beautiful, different than his previous works.","I just purchased this album via download, as apparently purchasing a new CD is impossible at the moment (and why is that? truly Adam Ant should receive more support for his albums...record companies must be very shortsighted) There is a freshness and acoustic quality to ""Wonderful"" which is very charming. I really like the honesty and openness of the lyrics as with all of his albums. This will be my first non-secondhand non-vinyl purchase for Adam Ant...thank God for the ability to purchase albums by download!"
5,'wonderful!',"This is proberly my favourite album by Adam Ant and I have a few!Very different to the earlier style of the ants,more mellow but the man has still got it!There isn't a weak song on the whole album ,they are all great songs and sound wonderful at full blast on the car stereo too!!My personal favourites are: vampires,wonderful and alien.Might be worth buying 2 copies in case you wear the first one out!!!!"
5,Wonderful is an appropriate title,"I bought this originally for the one song that almost everyone has heard, ""Wonderful"". It's a beautiful song, easy to get into, and one of those you almost have to play again before you feel you can move on. Let's say I was most pleasantly surprised by the rest of the tracks. My favorite of the album (even before wonderful) has to be ""Vampires"". When you give it a first listen, the lyrics strike you as cheesy, almost comical. But the instrumentals of the song and the way his voice begins to harmonize with them really took me by surprise. ""Won't Take That Talk"" was also a personal favorite of mine. It's a great opener for the album, basically begging you to sing along with it. Many of the other tracks are very worthy as well but I'm running out of space. So I guess I'll close it off by saying this is one of those albums where you can really empathize with what he has to say."
2,Great Song,"""Wonderful"" is a great song. I was a big Ant fan back in the 80's and heard the buzz about it when this came out. Never did hear it on the radio when I bought this c.d. and was pleased with that song but outside it nothing much else here is much to get excited about."
5,"wonderful, indeed!","as a whole i would definately rate it at about 3 stars, but 'beautiful dream"" is such a great song that i had to make sure that this album gets what it deserves."
1,Not for those with a bad back,"I bought this DVD with the hope of getting a good workout. Although you get plenty of upper body exercise with various twists, punches & turns, you don't get ANY lower body exercise. A surprise to me since boxers have to be light on their feet. It was a BIG disappointment! Even watching/exercising with it the first time I was bored. Also, those with back problems beware. There is a lot of twisting involved.The sound quality is poor, as if it was recorded in the trainer's basement or garage. I found this to be the case with the Chair Circuit Training DVD as well.In the past I purchased the Chair Aerobics and the Chair Circuit training DVD's made by the same company that produced this DVD. Out of the three the ""Chair Aerobics"" is the best.""I'm not very impressed with the company that produces this series of exercise DVDs.All in all, I would not recommend this DVD. I don't plan on ever using it again."
5,Great workout,This isn't the first DVD I've purchased with the Chair Aerobics.. I just tried it for the first time and I LOVE IT! The trainer has a wonderful and fun personality which makes it fun to workout..The exercises itself was great and had me drinking a ton of water after! Highly recommended.
3,Good Workout For Someone With A Lower Body Disability Or A Beginner To Exercise,"I recently had foot surgery and am unable to stand on my feet for a long period of time or do high impact exercises. My usual workouts consist of running and P90X DVD's so I am fairly athletic. This video works well for someone who does have a physical handicap in their legs or feet which prevents them from standing much if at all. It works the upper body and abs. Obviously there isn't much being done to the lower body in terms of toning. One complaint for me is that the video wasn't long enough. I was just beginning to sweat when it was almost over! I could have kept going for sure. I am used to a much more intense and difficult workout though so maybe this is perfect for someone just starting their exercise routine. All in all, a decent video for someone like me recovering from an injury who's used to being active and doesn't want to just sit all day feeling helpless as far as working out goes."
3,Great tool when it works,I used this for a couple of days trimming shrubs and pine trees. It worked great! It's like a sawzall on a stick. I was cutting up to about three inches in diameter limbs. Then one day I was taking out some massive bushes and on the 5th one it stopped working. You could move the blade back and forth with your hand. I went to www.trimmerplus.com to look up the nearest repair center (as instructed in the manual). Everyone on their list said they wouldn't fix it and they don't know why they are in the DB. Then I tried the 800 number service locator. Again... everyone close was either outta business or wouldn't fix it. Finally a customer service rep tracked down a place about 25 miles from me (an autobody shop???). I'm going there today to drop it off. I'll update the post with any relevant info. HTH.
3,not sure about this tool,"I just used the tree trimmer add-on for the first time. A few times the screw that holds the blade loosened. Don't know why. It is important to make sure that the screw that holds the blade is quite tight and that the motor is on the high setting. Also, this works best with hard, rigid stems. With rigid stems and branches it works like a charm - but be patient. It works very poorly with thin or flexible stems like forsythia."
2,"not quite ""there""","Mine wouldn't work, the pruner shaft tube was a bit too long to work when attached to the extension; I disassembled it and cut it down 1/2"" shorter and it worked good after that."
5,Great album with mostly fantastic songs!,This should be a Gold album! It has so many cute numbers on it and some wonderful and meaningful ballads.1. Tanya juggling her men. Cute and ironic. 5/52. Saucy attitude song. Uptempo. 5/53. Ballad. Too whining. 1/54. Mid-tempo. It's great. Tanya not settling with being nr 2. 5/55. NOT a favourite. Not much of a tune backing up the lyrics. 2/56. A nice ballad. 3/57. Favourite ballad. It's catchy and strong. 5/58. Raw song. Almost sounds like Elvis. Mid-tempo. 3.5/59. Another ballad. 2/510. Cute mid-tempo song. Very catchu and fun! 5/5
4,Once Again Kaminsky Gives Us a Good Story,"Abe Lieberman is a thin, jewish, sixty year old police detective in Chicago; his wife is the president of his synagogue; his daughter, who is on her second marriage is married to a black pathologist and live in the bay area; his grandchildren (from his daughter's first marriage live with him). His partner is a big ex-football playing Irishman named William Hanrahan; who is divorced, a recovering alcoholic (as is his younger son), and is in love with an Asian woman he wants to marry. On the Chicago force they are known as the 'Rabbi and Father Murphy'.The cases in this book are not of that much interest, but it is the inter- action of Lieberman and his partner with a myriad of characters from multiple cultures that make this a worthwhile read. Kaminsky is great at getting the nuances of speech and the causes behind the actions of his characters to be so honest and real. A worthy addition to the series."
5,Puppy's Favorite Treat,My 7 month old Wheaten has been enjoying these treats since he was 2-1/2 months old and never seems to tire of them as he has with other products. He gets one every day and anxiously looks forward as I put one in his Kong for him to relish.
3,Not great,"My little dog definitely loves eating ziggies... but it's not as great as I thought it would be.My dog isn't a great chewer and maybe that's why he doesn't pay his lil kong too much mind (though he will play fetch with it). After sticking a ziggie in about half way, he carried it to his bed and ate it pretty quickly. So I know he definitely enjoys it, but if a piece gets stuck inside, he just gives up. And it seems to crumble a bit too much for my liking, leaving tiny lil pieces of it all over his bed..."
2,Ziggies,"My puppies really like this in their little Kongs. The only issue I have it that they do not last very long. I thought the Ziggie would be more like a nylabone intead of like a cookie. I have two 3 month old Cocker Spaniel puppies, and they seem to eat them very quickly and are able to pull the Ziggie out of the Kong with no problem. I kind of wanted something that would keep them busy and out of trouble, but this isn't the thing for that."
5,My pup loves this,"I got our first ziggy treat in a puppy Kong box. Unfortunately, I can't find the ziggies at Petco locally. I'm so happy to find these - our puppy takes this treat and goes directly into her crate with it to chew away with no interruption."
1,Not for small Kongs,"These treats fit the extra-small Kong, not the small one. They won't even stay in the small Kong. Get this only for really small dogs, I'd say 10 lbs or less."
3,So Far...So Good...,My brother asked me to buy this for him...I started to watch it and then I had to leave. I never finished watching it...I love the London 60's..I am going to have to borrow it to watch the rest because he won't tell me what happpens at the end!! But..so far...it's good!
2,Misleading Focus,"I used Princeton to study for SAT II Biology this past summer, going through it bit by bit over the course of the school year. As other reviewers have mentioned, the details are excellent and the book is easy to read. However, I made a mistake: I took the practice tests the day before I took the SAT IIs. I realized that Princeton's focus is on the smaller details, rather than the overall concepts and general information that the practice tests revealed the SATs were concerned with. I did well on the exam, but found myself racking my brain for details from my Biology class. There are a few specific areas, such as hormones, which the book helped with, but overall, I feel that I should have used at least on other prep book.If for nothing else, I recommend the book for its practice tests. I think they're authentic - keeping in mind that the SAT people use some of the same questions from year to year."
1,numbingly familiar,"This book is numbing! These self-righteous reviewers ain't getting it - nothing is wrong with the story or Youngblood's supposedly traipsing on new ground (although her whole experience reads to me like the samo, samo, same ol' stroll down a well-beaten path) or not being in a manhunting waiting to exhale mode. It's The Writing, Stupid. Flatfooted and heavyhanded. Not to be mean, but that's the simple truth and the reason so many seem to be turned off by this black girl who maybe should've stayed home."
5,A Wonderful Novel,"What a wonderful story. As someone who wants to be a writer, I too thought that it would take meeting the author(s) that I admire most; following in their footsteps somehow. From this book, as Eden does in the end, I learned that writing has to come from you, within you. The writing is excellent. As in ""Soul Kiss"", Shay proves that she is a skilled writer. I only regret that I did not read this book sooner. I plan to read it again. Thank you Shay for following in the footsteps of Baldwin, Walker, Morrison, etal. You continue to prove that some of us are capable of more than just ""exhaling""."
1,Embarrassing,"I must say that this book is embarrassingly bad, embarrassing because Youngblood's first novel was pretty good. We as black people are all too eager to suspend critical judgment and cheer on anything that is black-produced. The two previous reviews have to be kidding - silly similes and flatfooted metaphors crowd this book, along with no comprehensible story line. It is no wonder that a list of some of the worst lines from this book is circulating on the web (and IT is very funny). As someone who lived in Paris for ten years, I can tell you all that there is nothing real about the descriptions of the city or its people. I hate to be so harsh, and my words are directed towards the book and not its author, but really folks, let's respect black writing enough to praise that which is truly praiseworthy and condemn that which stinks. Sorry, but Black Girl in Paris stinks."
1,dawning beauty!,"i would say it's more like yawning booty. what's up with all the effusive drama about this silly little book? i mean, i'm black, i'm a girl, last year i spent my junior year in Paris, and i can say from personal experience that the way the author describes Paris is like she just looked in a guide book. her portrayal is really superficial and the scenes are really cheesy, like every French person has rotten teeth and every black person is wise and musical. maybe she found herself at the end of this corny book but she sure lost this reader."
5,Made to Order for Me!,"This is such a perfect yoga dvd for me. Not too hard and not too easy. It features the ""Magnificent 7,"" which are exercises which are great for women to do every day. I was having a really hard time with symptoms of menopause and I feel noticeably better after doing this about 3x per week. I enthusiastically recommend this DVD for women of all ages. It will beautify you both inside and out."
5,Love this yoga dvd,"I have had this DVD for a while but haven't taken the time to review it until now. I love this DVD! It's very informative on what the moves can help with and the time flies by. I usually do the whole video, 45 min to an hour and feel awesome after I am finished, so refreshed and clear minded. I have thought of getting other Yoga DVD's but since this one has the matrix menu, there's no need. I can do the full DVD or choose exactly which segment I want to do. Also, Ana and Ravi do a good job on this one unlike other reviews I have read about their other yoga DVD's just a couple of corny remarks made but nothing crazy. ENJOY!"
4,One of the Best I've Tried...,"I bought this about a year ago and I like it, but use it less frequently because I find myself using their other DVD 'Fat Free Yoga.' When I am not using 'Fat Free,' I am using, 'Kundalini Yoga for Energy & Super Radiance!' or 'Kundalini Cardio, Stretch & Strengthen.' If I am not using any of these, I will use this one.This is a great DVD because Ana is super inspirational. The set is clean and upbeat. I love the music. The postures are great! I feel quite radiant after doing this one, but it is probably my least favorite of the ones that I have mentioned in this review."
5,The Magificent Seven,"This DVD features the Magnificent Seven poses which are supposed to be done daily according to yoga. I have a few of Ana And Ravi's other DVDs and this one is my favorite. The music, cuing, and style is great and the time flies by. This is actually fun to do! I love hearing Ravi explain the benefits of each pose, which is motivating while you are holding a difficult pose.Don't let the title fool you, the emphasis is on bringing out your INNER beauty. I'm not a yoga newbie but find this set just right, not too easy and not too hard. I prefer Kundalini yoga to other forms of yoga because in kundalini you are almost constantly moving. I feel calm and peaceful after this workout, not drained or exhausted."
5,I feel pretty,"I have done this program several times and class it as one of their top 5. It is about 40 minutes if you skip the opening chant, breath of fire prime, and beauty meditation. It does not get your heart rate up but it feels very pilates in terms of the way muscle groups are worked. There is not a single pose in the practice that I do not enjoy, especially some of the more difficult ones like shoulder stand and upward bow. Both Ana and Brett narrate and the music flows well with the movement. My only beef with is the ""7 essential poses"" on the DVD menu is just a series of still pictures. I think they should have had a 12 minute (or so) working segment that just focused on a flow of these 7 poses with an explanation on why they are so important. Heck, all of their DVDs are spliced together, I think it would have been an easy addition. Other than that minor bit of pickiness, a winner."
3,"Good, but not for beginners","Pros: It's a good variety of exercises with rests in between each kind. I really felt like I got a good work out and meditationn session.Cons: I'm a beginner at yoga, and this was my first attempt at kundalani yoga. Rather than holding just holding a pose, you're always moving in a certain position. Some of poses were way to difficult for a beginner, like the shoulder handstand. The video could have done without some cheesy parts, like Ana dancing. They make you do things that could be embarassing to do around other people, like chant and move your rib cage in a circle while sitting down.Bottom line: I'll stick with my ""Yoga for Beginners by Barbara Benaugh"" for now, and save this DVD for when I'm alone in my apartment and feeling like getting a challenging workout."
3,"""safely ensconsed in the universal womb""","This video gives you a nice yoga work out- but I have to say that once I did it enough times to know what came next, I turned off the sound and did it to my own music because Ravi's voice is beyond annoying! These videos made me realize that its pilates I prefer becuase the spirituality of yoga can be a little too much for me. I dont really want to feel ""safely ensconsed in the universal womb"" and thats a direct quote."
3,Too Much Emphasis on Beauty,"This DVD contains some wonderful exercises and are shown to perfection by Ana Brett. Unfortunately, I was really turned off by the constant mention of beauty/firming talk. During shoulder stand, it was mentioned that it will bring out the beauty in your face. The only thing that will make my face beautiful is plastic surgery, not doing the shoulderstand. It is one thing to talk about looking radiantly healthy, but the constant body image talk trivialized the workout and ruined it for me."
5,This one is my favorite,"Out of all the DVD's that Ana Brett & Ravi Singh have, this one is my favorite. I have had it since it came out. When I first tried it I thought it was tough (and I am pretty tough). I persisted and fell in love with this DVD practice. It makes me feel beautiful. The postures flow perfectly one to the other and just when you think you can't go on a light easy posture comes up and you can continue. Beautifully balanced, the musice blends magnificently! Ana & Ravi are always encouraging and giving you incentives to go on. I never stop until I make it thru the entire session so I can watch Ana dance and see those words ""you are beautiful"". Inspiring! Thank you Ana & Ravi."
2,"An excellent video, but very into Eastern mysticism...","The production of this DVD is excellent. That said, I feel compelled to warn Christian viewers that it will be offensive to them because of its focus on Eastern mysticism and praying/chanting words to call on ""your higher self."" You practice breathing exercises by chanting certain words (""sat"" and ""nam""). This is Hinduism, pure and simple. Don't go there.I highly recommend you google ""Christian yoga"" and choose one of those videos. Read this website for more info about what you might be getting into before you venture into yoga, like I did: http://www.praisemoves.com/ChristianAlternative.htm.By the way, I've never written a commentary on Amazon before. I felt this warranted my voice be heard to prevent other believers from buying into the yoga craze through one of these DVDs."
3,The problem with covers of Yoko Ono songs is...,"... the songs themselves are so honestly from Ono's heart, so specifically written for her voice, her sound, her range--endearing and breathtaking and to Western ears ""imperfect""--that these trained singers fall short of the true heart of the music.Listen if you're curious, but the true expression of these songs lie in the original Yoko Ono albums they came from: ""Season of Glass,"" ""a Story,"" ""Approximately Infinite Universe,"" ""Fly,"" ""Feeling the Space,"" ""It's Alright,"" and ""Starpeace.""The clearest example I can think of is Ono's unbelievably beautiful song ""Toy Boat"" from ""Season of Glass,"" which here is belted out in true musical style, but in the original is sung quietly, tentatively, hopefully..."
1,Gave my wife a headache and couldn't be returned,"This perfume smells great, but for some reason almost immediately gave my wife a headache when she put it on and unfortunately for us if you try to return it, Amazon says this:""For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com. Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations. Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.""So be very sure that you want to buy it!"
2,Not the best,This perfume does not last all day like I assumed it would. It has a nice smell but when I put it on it almost evaporates in the air within minutes of me putting it on.
3,Not what I expected,I wanted to try out all curve perfume varieties. I thought this would be a sweeter scent but it's more on the spicy side which I don't like very much. It's an ok scent but I wouldn't buy it again. I do recommend the original curve for women. That's a very feminine scent.
4,GREAT PURCHASE,I am proud of this purchase. The price is great and the item is great. Speedy delivery and the fragance is not bad. Great for the price. Will definately make more purchases as its better than buying from expensive department stores. GREAT BUY.. THANKS.
2,I was so disappointed!!!,I brought Curve Crush for women and was very disappointed when I received it. The packaging for the perfume and the perfume bottle looked authentic but when I sprayed the perfume it didn't smell like Curve Crush. It would go on strong and then after a while the smell would just disappear. With all the other Curve Crush perfumes that i've purchased from different places the smell lingered well into the evening. I've purchased this product from many different stores before but never at the price of 19.64 so I thought it was a great deal. Next time I will just go ahead and spend the extra money. I've never had an issue with Amazon before and I will continue to order from here just not when buying my perfume.
5,A classic,"This excellent children's book (and at 24, I still enjoy it!) is superbly written and quirkily illustrated by Enright herself. She brings to life once again, the four Melendy children -- Mona, the beautiful, vain, Shakespearean actress in training, Rush, the erratic piano prodigy, Randy, the kindhearted painter/dancer and Oliver, the chubby young entomologist in the making. It's hard to describe the continuing ability to fascinate, the mesmeric hold these pleasantly told, often quietly funny pages have for the reader, even when one reads the book over and over again. The addition of a new member of the family makes for great adventure and an unexpected element of danger in a book by Enright."
3,Somewhat disappointed,I bought this because the story line sounded intriguing and it had Joey Lawrence in the cast. Everybody has different reasons for watching a movie and you may love this for the subject matter. I just expected better acting and role/story development from the cast and movie description.
3,Ferris Wanna Be,"This movie wanted to be Ferris Bueller, but it didn't quite make it. It could have been better, but the script just didn't make it. I have no doubt that the cast was up to the challenge, but the solutions some of the characters used to get out of their situations were just stupid (""I'll take the test RIGHT NOW!"" while ripping his shirt off? Why is this funny?). I would have found the movie a lot funnier if the schemes the students were up to came across as something that could even remotely work. This movie comes across as a story written for 6th graders by a 6th grader."
1,"Simply Bad...Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad","Cheats is, without a doubt, the worst movie I have ever seen. Besides the mind-numbing absence of plot and meaningful character development, the humor is also painfully trite. I knew this movie was horrible 5 minutes in, but I continued to watch it only to see what Martin Starr was up to after Freaks and Geeks. In the end, I felt embarassed for the writer/director of this miserable endeavor. Please don't waste your time on this nonsense. Learn from my mistake."
5,So funny I couldn't turn it off!!!!!,Ok so I was sitting watching tv when this movie came on I just didn't turn it off. A friend was with me and she didn't change the channel either. Now we have both been looking for it everywhere. Now that I have found it I love it and am so excited.
5,This Movie Rocks!!,"This is One of the best moives i have ever seen!! I was looking throught the channels when i came upon it. it is the best moive, if u havent already u should go get it!JIMMY CARTER"
2,Too much discoursing,"Twenty years ago George Maloney wrote this eight-day retreat. His scriptural references seem quite dated. While there are parts to this retreat that can be beautiful and thought-provoking, other parts seem to be so much verbage. For instance, he delves into the Eucharist with great enthusiasm. But too much discourse concerning this mystery can make it seem irrelevant and remote. At the end of the retreat he writes that Christ is available to all, but will give himself to those who make a conscious effort to know him. To this reader, this is the kind of locked in logic of Catholic teaching. A statement is made and then withdrawn almost. What is this conscious effort? What does it require? Maloney says nothing. so in the end all this wonderful stuff, while available, may not be attainable because the reader may not be doing the right things. Apparently, according to Maloney, God has neither the power nor the love to crash through a person's inabilities or blindnesses. Pity."
2,Rola 59150,Took this on a trip to Colorado from Ohio.Negative: A couple of seams gave way maybe an inch or two long. That was disappointing. Needs to have some support on the bottom to prevent bottom sagging and flapping in the wind. Aluminum frame not the best. Product is made in CHINA.Positives: Folds down to maybe a few inches thick when you are done--easier storage after your trip. It kept our clothes dry during the trip.
4,Roof Carrier,"The Rola 59150 is overall a great product. The one complaint I have or weakness I see is that there is no stability to the canvas bottom. That being said when you store anything that has any weight to it, it sags between the frame rails. What I did was! I created my own floor with a 2X4 piece of 1/4 Luan Plywood and screwed it to the frame. This did not add much additional weight to the unit. It worked great now I love the product."
1,NOT RECCOMENDED,"I gave a star because I had to.The carrier came in, only in tthe seller box, it had very large holes all over.The aluminum frame didn't fit one inside the other, this caused the fabric to rip.It was very diffucult to assembly and then we just couldn't secure it to our SUV, we wasted a lot of time and effort.I had to buy a large box to send it back and return this item.The only good thing: I GOT MY MONEY BACK, not the box money though.NOT RECCOMENDED"
3,rola 59150 folding roof top carrier,"I order the rola folding roof top carrier because of the design, price, reviews. It came to late to use on my family vacation. Iwas going to use it on my suv, to help with the luggage of 5 family members going on vacation for a week.It was easy to put together, looked nice, but unfortunately it still unused.My only concern about the design, is the alumium frame sitting on car top instead of a luggage rack; causing damage to paint maybe.That is my reason for the 3 star instead of 5 star."
2,Customer,"This arrived in a box that had been previously opened and re-taped as well as squashed. The product looks to be very stable and well made. It would be nice to see some detailed pictures or a description as to what the various attgachments are for and how to use them.I read the directions and it's hard to figure out what's to be used for what.Frankly I'm a bit dissapointed in Amazon regarding this product. I will try to assemble and figure out. If not, it's going back!"
4,Instructions are a bit hard to read,"The instructions are a bit hard to read, but I've read other comments saying the same thing. It took both myself and my husband (and a flash light) to figure out where one piece went to. We had to literally take turns sliding into the carrier in an attempt to figure out where exactly one part went (there's two openings for the side bar it seems, but the bar only fits in one of the two, and it took both of us to get it in place.) It has not been used yet, I'll try to remember to come back to tell how it does on a road trip from central Mississippi to Walt Disney World. It's very spacious, holds both of the children's duffel bags and our duffel bag plus an over night duffel bag. I'm hoping to be able to put the small stroller on top of the bags once we are get it packed up, it looks like it'd work without any problems."
3,50/50,Likes(1)Lightweight(2)Easy to install(3)Easy to load and unload cargo(4)Best off all it folds up easily and neatly for storage.Dislikes(1) Tear due to support bar pushing through the fabric. Would consider this as a design flaw.(2) Another tear that just magically appeared. Cause unknown.(3) Took considerable load adjustment to prevent wind noise.Now I have to find a way to repair at additional time and cost due to no fault of my own.Would be hesitant to buy another one.Rola 59150 Pursuit Folding Roof Top Carrier
2,"Not so good, but made it.","We bought this carrier for a trip from So. Cal to Kansas. It fit great on our Mercury Mariner and the metal frame mounts securely to the roof rack with no tools. The front is streamlined some what. I really didn't notice any gas mileage hit at all. Problem is it broke down along the way. The back has a thin metal bracket that helps expand the top of the carrier. This bracket poked itself through the wall lining causing the bag to collapse in the rear. The top then deteriorated and five rips/tears appeared after about three states. The wind whipped it pretty good causing the rubberized material to flake off like paint chips. We folded it flat like the instructions show and used the supplied cover on the way back. The cover ripped up on the way back so I used tie downs to prevent any more damage. I do think I can use this one more time with tie downs, but of course, the weather proofing is gone. Next time I'll spring for the hard carrier!"
2,Waste of my money,"I purchased this item and had just a little trouble getting it put together due to lack of instructions. Once together I thought it was a great solution to my car's small trunk space. However after using this I realized I was wrong, because it leaked when it rained and now the material is starting to wear away on the top of the carrier. I've had it for only 6 months and used it 5 times. I really wish I would have bought a hard case carrier vs the Rola Folding one. I'm very disappointed that I wasted my money on this."
1,"1st trip -great, 2nd trip - it's in a garage sale ...","The first time we used this, it worked great on top of our 2004 Honda Accord. Loved that it folded down while we were at our destination, kept our things dry in rain, and for the price, it worked. On our second trip, with less gear, the front horizontal support bar pushed through the passenger side. I pulled over for gas and had what looked like a 12 inch flag pole sticking out the side. It had pushed through the red ""reinforced"" pocket and the material itself. I had some duck tape and fixed it and the next time we pulled over, it had pushed through the duck tape and through the drivers side. We finished our trip with it sticking out both sides. The holes are too wide to cover, and now I am purchasing another one (Thule, NOT Rola) for this years trip. Disappointed with this product!"
4,Just what we needed.,"This carrier was used for our recent family trip from Indiana to Florida. It held 4 large duffel bags very well. We had a little issue with the zipper at first, but we fixed it and there was not another problem with it. The ease and convenience of folding it down was very nice. We also love the fact that it is so easily stored in our garage and doesn't take up a lot of space."
2,"Great at first, doesn't last","Initially this product was a great alternative to an expensive hard shell carrier. It was easy to install, the frame is strong, and the access and space is excellent. However, the zippers are extremely poor quality, not suitable for such a large and flexible item. The zippers often split apart and the material holding them has started to tear. When its cold it is very difficult to grip the small zipper pulls. They buckle and are extremely hard to close. With a torn zipper, this product with its other great features, becomes completely useless - unless you don't mind your stuff all over the road behind you."
4,Rola 59150 Pursuit Folding Roof Top Carrier,"Worked well in light rain on a 600 mile trip. More moisture from condensation than anything else. Assembly is a bit tough, had to open up one of the holes where it snaps together, and cover is VERY tight on frame. One hint, if your crossbars are thin (like mine) you can place sections of rubber hose over the u bolts to take up the space. This also keeps them from scratching the cross bars."
4,"Sturdy, yet flexible","I've used two different bag carriers in the past. Both were pains to use, especially in winter, when the zippers and fabric were stiff. In those cases, too, the zippers were on top, difficult to reach and stuff luggage. This Rola was a relief for my budget and back. Sturdy aluminum frame in a bottom sleeve that's separate from luggage compartment (although part of a bracket ripped my inner fabric while inserting frame). Flexible soft-side design has allowed me to fit a large family tent, 6 sleeping bags, about 6 duffel/backpacks, and 3 folded air mattresses (easily stuffed from one of 3 zippered doors with weather flaps). On my 04 Durango, with crossbars, installation was simple and allowed enough room alongside for 6 camp chairs. I deducted a star b/c fabric ripped and instructions were poorly written. I love the collapsibility and provided rain fly. Although I was searching for a reasonable shell carrier, this seems like it is a better value. Smart design!"
5,best of both worlds,"We got this carrier to use on a road trip from NC up to MA and back. We didn't want a hard shell carrier because we didn't have a place to store it when we were finished using it. And the soft cargo bags didn't look sturdy enough to hold everything in place. So we figured this would be the best of both worlds, and it really was. Also, the price was very good. We had some confusion putting the carrier together (didn't realize there was an underneath pocket to put the frame inside), but when we figured it out, it didn't take long. We packed the carrier to use every possible inch of space, and had no problems on the way there or back. We even ran into a rainstorm and none of our belongings had even a drop of water on them. Once we were done, it was easy to take the carrier down and fold it up. Highly recommend this product."
5,Harvey's Real Review,"Cameo once again shows their staying power on this live album (NASTY)!I've been a Cameo fan since the seventies, when they hit us with ""Rigor Mortis"".Every cut on this CD is tight!The way they did ""Back and forth"" really blew me away. ""Candy"" has become a favorite with the hip hop generation I was happy that it was included.Charlie Singleton and Aaron Mills were clicking on all eight with the lead guitar and bass tip.They appeared to be having a duel. The only disappointment was that they didn't include the song ""SLYDE"".Cameo is an original. Unlike most of today's groups, they are musicians.They had nine or more people in the group at one point. Hopefully there will be a Cameo reunion tour and the now generation would be able to see and hear a real group!"
1,This cd is a shame!,"The CD was payable ,But the case was in horrible condition.It looked like it had been ran over by a car!!!!!!!!! I've had numerous CD's but never anything like this.Did I mention that it was labeled as VERY GOOD!"
3,Good Collection,"There could have been more classic games from the 80's, but overall a good collection and good video quality."
1,Lacking,This dynasty series is the poorest of them all. I own two others which both have allot more whole games and feature documentaries in them and are overall superior. The only title the 76'ers won in the modern era has one game devoted to it and that is an away game. They could have easily included at least one more game from that series - preferably at the Spectrum. To not include a home game in a championship run is a glaring omission. And what about 1980 or 1982? I know the 76'ers lost but they could at least show a game from those championship runs which would give their victory in '83 ultimately even more importance. And I agree with some of the other reviewers -AI who cares!! He never won anything. If you are looking for a quality dynasty series dvd purchase the Celtics or Lakers collections instead.
4,Wish there was more Wilt,"I love having full length games featuring the greats of the 76ers. The one thing, however, that I truly loathe is the lack of content they have on Wilt Chamberlain. The 1967 76ers team is arguably one of the greatest in NBA History, featuring the NBA's most prolific scorer and rebounder (other's may have passed Wit, but he only played 13 years [as opposed to 20 for Kareem], still holds most offensive records forty+ years after his retirement and rebounded again and again and again - anyone else average over 27 rebounds an game for an entire season or 22.9 per game average over a career? See what I m saying?) So why, WHY did they limit the video of Wilt to the same of stock video we've seen a thousand times before? Other than that, I enjoyed it."
2,A Brief Story about an Owl,"I would class this book as a children's book. I expected there to be more to it, or I wouldn't have purchased it. Not much time was spent on details of each episode in this owls life. About the time you get interested in one event, the story jumps to a different scene. When i finished reading the book, which took me less than 30 minutes, I didn't feel I knew much more about the owl than before I read the book. I felt I had missed part of the story. An interesting story, but too abreviated."
3,adopted by an owl,"I found this book good. Its a true story about Jackson the owl. A young boy meets a owl one day and becomes friends with it. It has ok coloring, to much brown, but good drawing. Its a good read. So read it!..."
5,Adopted by an Owl,Both the pictures and the story are wonderful. The expressions given to the owl are great and the story is very warm and touching.
4,GREAT CD!! His BEST yet!,I love this cd by Billy Dean! Its a great country cd by one of the best new country singers of today. The title track is very catchy and lovely and so is the rest of the cd. I highly recommend this cd.
5,Good to know - this is book of music notes...,It is not really review of book (how can I actually review book written by man who is lights of years talented than me?). I just wanted to say - this is book of music notes for Leonard Cohen songs. Yesterday I received it and I was surprised. Have friend of mine who is musician - book will become a gift for him.
4,Perfect,I wanted to place this thing on a friend's doorstep to hear a shriek. It was lifelike enough for my joke to be successful.
3,entertaining science fiction set in imaginary worlds,"This is another entertaining book in the Vorkosigan series. The part that appealed to me most is the new worlds and civilizations that Bujold dreams up and how the hero deals with them. All the worlds have human beings, but the cultures are different, even bizarre, but always entertaining."
4,A different look at an old enemy,"The Cetagandans are the usual ""Bad Guys"" in Lois McMaster Bujold's Vorkosigan series, in this book we see a more sympathetic side to some of them. This book takes place chronologically in Miles Vorkosigan's early career, concurrant with the book ""Ethan of Athos"". It focuses more on the political intrigue that Bujold does so very well, but also points out that even the ""enemy"" can have a sympathetic face. Very strong female characters (as usual) but Miles is definately center stage."
5,Great cutting board,"This cutting board is great, but it's a bit on the small side. It's 8x12, so it's a little bigger than a piece of paper. The board is beautiful, sturdy, and I love that it's bamboo, but realistically I can only fit one thing at a time on it. If you're looking for a smaller board, I would say this is probably the one to get; since it's one piece it has less chance of warping. But if you need room to cut up more than one veggie at a time, go with a bigger one."
4,Adhesive remover,"Good product but company, esticker never sent an invoicealthough, I prepaid, I would like an invoice."
4,Does a good job...,"It's not the best on really hard ground or clay, but it's good. It will dig up the ground and it works excellent when mixing new dirt/compost in."
2,Bait and Switch,The trimmer works well but it's not the one that I ordered. I'm only given it two stars because the seller knew what they were doing. They advertise one product but sent a knock-off in it's place just becareful and make sure you check your product before you use it.I was unsuccessful in trying to reach the seller do not purchase from this seller.
4,Tiller Attachment,"Works very well but the head does get heavy, so the strap is helpful but works well and does a nice job."
5,Best toy ever!,"This is one of the best board games I have ever played. It is completely entertaining. If you have the right group of people, this can be extremely entertaining for hours! You really have to use your mind to. It's not just one of those easy games. It's all about puzzles!"
5,Great.,"I, as a kid who grew up with this book, know that it is a great way to introduce you kids to a lot of things, I do believe that this book helped me become the poet I am. I remember loving the rhymes and pictures, I will always cherish this book and someday read it to my kids."
1,poor stiching,"The stitching on the small finger of the left glove was so far off it was unwearable. These were supposed to be size large but they barely fit my not so big hands. I'm right handed and thus my right hand is a bit bigger then my left but, it was the left glove whose stitching was off enough to the seam ran along the top of my small finger and ground into my hand. I tried to ""break in"" the glove a bit but the skin wore out before the glove broke in."
3,Not as interesting as their debut,"1995's Coarse was the second album from Collision, whose debut featured an interesting mix of alternative rock, funk and hair metal. By 1995 though, alternative was the dominant form of rock, so this is a much more straightforward alternative rock album.To my ears, Coarse is nowhere near as interesting as the debutCollisionalbum. It sounds like every other alternative rock album released in 1995. ""Get Up or Get Hurt"" is a funky track that shows a pulse, but the rest of the album is like Soundgarden lite, buried in fuzzy guitars and with the vocalist imitating Chris Cornell this time instead of Axl Rose. It also hurts that the sound quality is so dreadful. You need nearly twice the volume just to hear this disc as you would any other CD from that era.Collision is still a band that's worth hearing, but I'd recommend the more interesting and innovative debut album over Coarse, unless you're just that much into the 90's alternative rock sound."
3,Ideal source if you need to quickly learn Italian.,"This resource guide (including two audio cassettes) is ideal if you are going to be traveling to Italy and you need to learn/brush up on some general expressions, but if you want to learn the language (in-depth) and form your own sentences, then this is not the best source. In it you will find basic phrases needed for communicating in a foreign country. The topics covered include the alphabet, numbers, time, general expressions, hotel and restaurant needs, transportation, communications, and emergency situations. The tapes are very clear and each phrase is spoken once in English and then translated twice in Italian. Overall, for not knowing any Italian, it has provided me with a ""window view"" (if you will) of the langauge, however I will be searching for something alittle more detailed on sentence structure and forming my own sentences in the future."
1,<yawn>,"I couldn't even finish listening to this, I was so disappointed. Rehashed, reduced, a comic book image of a formerly great band. Any of you out there who think that its 'closed minded' to knock the Butthole Surfers for becoming boring (which appears as ""mature"" in some reviews) and accusing them of sleeping on the job in the creativity department are just being pedantic. Why, for example, would I want to buy, say, ""Band On the Run"" by Wings when I know that ""Revolver"" by the Beatles is an infinitely more satisfying work, even if Paul McCartney has ""matured"" or ""gone in a different direction""? That said, return to their 80's work and give your brain a hernia-don't waste time with this."
2,"Not worth the money, even if it's used","I tried to get into this album, i really did. To me, this album makes the Butthole Surfers move a hundred steps back in the musical world. In the 90's they went from innovative, crazy, indescribably brilliant music straight to boring, uninspired, run-of-the-mill ""rock"" music like this slop (It is so unoriginal, they even rip off a Springsteen melody in ""TV Star"") I gave it a generous two stars, only because of one decent song, ""Cough Syrup."" If you want to get into the Butthole Surfers, i would instead point you in the direction of Hairway to Steven - or anything else from the 80's for that matter. Just don't make the same mistake I did and purchase this."
2,Butthole Surfers homogenized,"Next to the crap-filled pioghed, this is a masterpiece. Compare it with any other BS album, and it shows its true colors. Uninspired and boring with very few exceptions(Cough Syrup, for one).Reading these reviews, 2 different patterns emerge: people who don't have a clue about the butthole surfers raving about it, and longtime fans gnash their teeth over it.If you are interested in the Butthole Surfers, get anything else besides this. Independant Worm Saloon would be a safe beginning, but not their best. Go back in time to Hairway to Steven, Rembrant Pussyhorse, Locust Abortion Technician, or Psychic, Powerless, Another Mans Sac, and learn what great music these warped guys from Texas can churn out. My first exposure to the surfers was Live PCPed, another good but scary choice.Just don't bother with this one."
2,This is some weird stuff.,"This CD is the only stuff that I have ever heard from the Butthole Surfers, but I am still making the stereotype of them being a small-town garage band with some messed-up music. Just look at the groups name. There are a couple of decent songs on this CD, but they do not carry the CD. It leaves the album hanging pretty high on my Weird-Stuff-O-Meter."
2,"One good song, and it's a ripoff of a better one.","Just so you know, I don't ever buy CD's merely for the singles, in fact I really don't even care about that, but I'm sorry to say that the single ""Pepper"" is the reason I bought this, and everything else here totally let me down. The worst thing about it is that while that is the only good song on here, it's a total ripoff of the Beck song ""Loser"". Just think about it, they have the same structure, same beat, just different lyrics. But I do like that song, though.A lot of good bands may come out of Austin, Texas, but I don't think this is one of them."
5,"Visit ""Electriclarryland"" today!","Although this album sounded pretty dumb the first time around, something about it kept me coming back. Finally, I figured out why I was getting addicted. ""Electriclarryland"" is one of the most strange, interesting, and fun releases on the market. I have listened to this Butthole Surfers masterpiece several times in row, without ever experiencing boredom. Each song is equally original. Like any good album, this can be a real trip if you are in the right mood. For that reason, I would highly recommend this release from what is now one of my favorite musical acts."
1,Disappointment,"I commend the author on his attempt to display a solution on oversleeping, however I found this material to best suit an article in a magazine rather than book form. The content was not anything that you do not already know, no matter who you are, you have just got to apply the will to want to wake up. What the book boils down to is you must have internal motivation to wake up on time. If you have problems getting up, then the chances are that you do not have anything exciting to wake up to. Save the price of this book and go by a goal setting book instead. Good luck and Godspeed..."
1,Where is my book?,"I ordered this book on 7/28/09. My credit card has been charged but I have not received the book yet, meanwhile the order record is disappeared too. Where is my book?""Learn Chinese the Fast and Fun Way (Barron's Fast and Fun Way Language Series)"""
5,Great for Novices,"I have come back to this book more times then I can count. Its a great book for building basic Unix skills, and a nice introduction to shell programming. John is also an excellent teacher, and for anyone who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area, look for Johns ""Unix Made Easy"" class at the UC Berekely Extension. Two thumbs up!Now if we can just get John to write a book on system administration..."
2,Better Books out there for sure!,"How this thing can rate 5 stars is really beyond me. This is just not that good. The layout, overall organization and readability are not effective.It might be right for some folks, but for people who like brief, clear and accurate descriptions of what a command does, this isn't the book for them. Other books are.If you like a ""folksy read"" where the author runs you through a topic for several pages, then says, oops it didn't work because, and then tells you the rest of the story about the command, this is for you. The author has a likeable style if that's what your up for. In that regard it may be a five.If you just like the scoop about a command without the surprise ending, look elsewhere. This book will frustrate you."
1,"Good for beginners, but that's it.","I agree that this could be a good book for beginners to learn UNIX. But, beginners tend to forget things and need a reference which this book definitely is not. So, if you are beginner and have already bought the book, go through it once, throw it away, and then buy Unix in a Nutshell."
1,I feel the book is very poorly organized.,This book is poorly organized. Reference to commands and functions are scattered all over the book. I was looking for a beginner type book. This book might serve someone who is experienced in Unix.
1,This should be titled Unix Made Difficult,"I used this book for a Unix class in my local community college. This is the worst text book ever written, I got lost many times. It was difficult to find related text and difficult to keep pace throughout the course. I am a seasoned Linux user and Linux certified, but I recieved no help through this book. If you want to learn Linux, I would reccommend any book by Michael Jang. He writes in an easy and detailed manner. John Muster may teach Unix, but he is a terrible author, go back to english prep John or take a lesson from Michael Jang."
1,Avoid this company!!,"I ordered a book through Amazon from aseg51331 on October 15th and was immediately charged for this purchase. In the meantime I placed many other Amazon and used book orders with other companies; all came within a very few days, yet still no book from aseg51331.On November 6th, I contacted Amazon to indicate I hadn't received this book. This message was forwarded to aseg51331 who sent me a return message indicating they had shipped this book earlier that very day. By November 11th I still had not received this book (which I needed for a gathering in late October) and thus e-mailed aseg51331 directly re. my missing book. I received no reply for the next 7 days. Then on November 18th the book arrived (still no reply to my message) and the shipping date on the package was November 11th.I would certainly NEVER buy from these people again! It is clear they don't value a customer's business."
4,Living thru the Holocaust,"Of the many recollections and diaries of survivors of WWII, none has so captivated the Western literary world as the Diary of Anne Frank. Published posthumously by her father, this book details the day-to-day experiences of a Jewish girl and her family in Nazi-occupied Holland over several years. Anne's family hid in the 2nd floor of a store owned by friends. Anne explains the tribulations and troubles of living as fugitives. This includes talking to only certain people, turning of the lights at night, not flushing the toilet at certain times, being able to cook only at certain times, and being cooped up in a space too small for her family. This book also describes the maturation of a girl into a teenage woman under duress.Overall, a good book to read to understand the Nazi occupation of Europe, the plight of Jews, and what war does to civilian populations."
5,Anne Frank,"Anne Frank was a beautiful book. This book had many meanings. It taught me never to judge people. I think that the most beautiful and meaningful quote is ""I still believe, in spite of everythig, that people are really good at heart."" Anne went through lives wondering if this was the day, she would be found. Any normal teen could not stand to sit still all day with out being able to go out side and enjoy the beautiful fresh air. Anne was not able too. Anne acheived everything she wanted in life, she kissed Peter and created a wonderful book that touched the life of millions. All because Anne was a girl that wouldn't give up. Shes the kind of girl that the world needs, someone that cares about more then her self and makes the best out of the worst. Please sit down and enjoy this book you will really be touched. Tara Callahan, age 13"
5,The Diary of Anne Frank,"The Diary of Anne Frank is a very interesting book. What I liked about it is how she has so much personality in her diary. The whole time I was reading it, I was thinking to myself, ""Was this book edited? It sounds so god! A 14 or 15 year old girl could not have written this!"" It was like she meant it to be a book all along. Her life was so complicated. Way too complicated then a 14/ 15-year-old's life should be. She dealt with it all very well though. Anne Frank was a very smart girl. She was so different from the rest of her family, and they didn't get that. She deserved to have been treated better. If only her family read her diary. If they read that diary, then everyone would have been so much appreciative of her. No one actually knew what types of things she went through. There was more to Anne Frank than what met the eye. Thanks to her diary we all know the real Anne Frank!-Ashlyn Roberts"
4,Another must read for holocaust doubters,"Even if you ""had"" to read this in school, a thought provoking true glimpse into the life of a Jewish teenager in World War II."
5,Wonderful,Glad to read a great book I missed until now (I'm 77). So sad to wonder what she would have accomplished if she had lived....and how her rescue was so close. She had great insight for a 13-15 year old! I wonder if it's still required reading in school. I hope so!
4,Lasting memory of a young girl,"It's about the most detailed book I've ever read. It's about a young Jewish girl and the awful life she lives.I would recommend it to antone twelve and up. It's a classic, everyone {at the right time} should read it. It teaches you a lot about the cruelty in the world, and how mean people can be. It should never happen again."
5,This is one of the world's best books!!!!,"Anne Frank's dream to go on living after her death has been fulfilled. She is known world-wide. I read the diary for a biography project for school and LOVED it! I may only be 12 years old, but this book meant something to me. Some may say it is too emotional for a 12 year old, but I believe that it is perfect for 2 reasons: 1- It's a diary, for Heaven's sake! Anyone loves the chance to read someone's diary, don't they?!? 2- Anne Frank was only 13 when she started her diary. It is a child's veiw of the Holocost. My mother is going to take me to the Holocost museum in Washington, D.C. soon. She says that before, I may not have been ready for it, but having read THe Diary of Anne Frank, I may be a little more prepared for it. Any one who has not read this should take it from me: IT IS AWESOME AND A MUST-READ FOR ANYONE OVER 10!"
1,One of the Worst Holocaust books,"This is probably one of the worst books I have ever read. I have neither found the carm of it or the point of the book. Firstly, this book does not really show or deal with the Holocaust. It is about a girl who is growing up! Being the age of fourteen I have not been able to relate to her in any which way.Secondly, the book is very boring. She goes on endlessly about her bordemn and the fights that happen in the Annex. Lastly, it does not really share anything historical about the Hollocaust except for the idea of hiding. Overall I found this book pointless and very irrelevent. I have read much better books sbout the Holocaust that deal with many historical events. If you really want to learn more about the Holocaust I would recommend For Freedom:The story of a French Spy and Number the Stars."
1,This was kind of boaring,"Anne Frank, The Diary of a Young Girl, was unlike any other book I have read, it was a mix of everything. I don't know why but it didn't seem to keep my intrest. It was slow in the beging and then it kept going down hill. I am kind of disapointed because I am really interest in the Holocaust. I hope to find a better book."
1,BAD BOOK!,"This is the worst book I have ever read!!! I started it with an interest toward the Holocaust. Anne Frank never talked about anything even relating to this major historical event in her short life. Anne Frank did describe her sexual attraction to females(p.117). She was obviously very flirtatious, which I wouldn't have minded if she had not filled almost half the book with it. Overall, Anne Frank was shockingly perverted, bad-tempered, and not very smart. Many teenagers act this way, but I have never met anyone who went to that extreme, and I have never met anyone who wrote it in a diary so descendents would be forced to read it. Even if that part was not in there, the book would still be horrible. She always writes about the same thigs. It is boring! So if you want to read this book you may, but I would like to warn you about this."
1,14 year old speaks out,I speaking as a 14 year old girl hated this book. I was forced to read it in 8th grade and it was a pretty good book but after a while it got very boring. I understand that this a horrific part of our history but come after so long of hearing about the same things a teenager will loose interest. So for those of you who are considering buying this book for enjoyment please reconsider for making your teenager read it.
2,This book was not the best book but it was not the worst.,"Anne Frank, the diary of a young girl, began interesting but after she went into hiding she began to ramble on about nothing. What she talked about did not grab my attention. But I can not say she had no talent in wrighting like she said she did beacuse she had no idea that she was going to die in the end and millions of people were going to be reading her book. Anne went through every day teenage problems. And beacuse she was locked up in close quarters with her family and another she had to express her feelings to a friend and she so did through her diary, Kitty. Thsi book was not a book I read again."
2,Troubling Memoirs of Anne Frank,"Troubling Memoirs of Anne FrankAnne and her family are Jews and have to follow ""Jew Laws"". The Germans start to take away Jews and Anne's family did not want this to happen to them. So they decided to hide in the ""Secret Annexe"". It is in an office building in a town and they have to stay quiet constantly so that no one will find them. They do this for about two or three years. The food is little and the schedule is very strict, but they do it so they won't be taken away.I did NOT like this book! 268 pages of the same events happening with an occasional twist got VERY boring. Of course, it was just her diary so it's not like she knew it was going to be published! Some things in the book were interesting and funny but I had a really hard time getting into it. The ""Afterwards"" section in the back was a bit more interesting just because of all the interesting facts and finding out about what happened after Anne stopped writing in her diary."
5,KOOL---BUY IT AT ONCE!,"Anne is first and foremost a teenage girl--stubbornly honest, touchingly vulnerable,in love with life. Its a really kool book.Before i read it, i thought this is boring but i change my mind after.She writes with adult wistom and views beyond her years. Her story is that for every teenager, lived out in condition few teenagers have ever known................i love it so much!"
3,The book was mediocre,I give the book a 5 . The book was all right.It was kind of dumb because they told the story in a dumb way... When the Nazi came there whole lives were changed.They lived a good life until the Nazi came. This was something big in history..
4,Anes,This book is pretty good after the beginning. It has a slow start and a good story in the middle.
4,I read this book as an adult..,Why I hadn't read this book as a middle schooler or high schooler I don't know. It was a thought provoking book.
4,Why it was purchased.,I am a senior citizen with a 15-year old granddaughter. I really bought the book for her but read it before giving it to her. I had never read it before and had not seen the movie. I was in high school during Anne's time in hiding and of course I heard about her after the war ended. It seemed to be a true copy of the diary without embellishment and I appreciated the footnotes for things I had never heard of before. It's a fast read and I recommend it highly.
5,amazingly moving,absolutely amazing Anne Frank does not hold anything back i loved this book seeing the difference between anne and i i was moved by the heart an love i have more respect for people in the holocaust
5,This book was really great,"This book is really what Anne frank was thinking when she was in hiding, that is why I find this book so great and compelling. Reading her story makes you realize how great life really is."
3,Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl,Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl is an exellent book to read. It shows you the feelings on how Anne and her family delt with living in the annex. The book shows you what happened to the Jews that went into hiding. The book also tells you how wonderful the Franks' were and that not all good things happen to good people. If I were to rate this book on a scale of one to ten I would rate this book a five or a six because I really don't like reading about accual things that happened in the world because I don't like the idea on how people would act towards others just because they're different. This book is really good if you would like to see what had happened in the Holocost. It shows you what things they went throught such as: getting their bikes taken away to them being tooken away to concintration camps. This book is good for people who like reading about things that are real and not made up.
3,Book Report for FCS,"This book was very informative and enjoyable. I learned alot about how it really was for Jews in hiding during WWII. I learned about all the terrible things they were put through because of hate, prejudice, and ignorance. I think that reading this book will really impact your way of thinking about WWII.I enjoyed most of the book, but some of it was a little irritating. I know that it was a personal diary for Anne but I did not enjoy listening to her obsess about things that seemed very trivial in the grand scheme of things. Overall this book was informative and interesting."
4,"Excellent History, but a bit bland","Following the Frank family and the families that stayed with them through 1942 - 1944 was looked at through the eyes of a young teenager - Hollander Anne Frank. Although the families were cut off virtually from civilization, Anne was still a normal teenager with the wonders of the world. A bit outstpoken for her family and the others at first, Anne found her niche in writing her diary. It was horrific what they to go through. A very moody girl, her diary reflects this and the moods of the seven others. But I must admit by the end of the book, I was getting a little jaded, it seemed to repeat itself over and over, but then again, most diaries are like that. She was fortunate her father was alive to give the diary to the world. The terrors the Jewish people went through is something that should never be forgotten."
5,Glad I finally picked it up!,"This is one of those books I 'always meant to read'. I've gotta say, I'm SO GLAD I wasn't forced to read this in school, since that seems to leave people with bad memories of great books due to difficult/tedious/trivial homework assignments. I couldn't put this book down, and it was so heartbreaking to read Anne's account of D-Day, realizing just two months later the Gestapo would get her. The book was just wonderful, and so very sad. I'm sure Anne would have made a great journalist had she lived!"
5,Amazing. . .,This book is amazing. Anne Frank is a young girl who is struggling in the cold and unforgiving time of the Holocaust. She keeps an unflinchingly honest and humorous view on the world around her. Frank pays close attention to the nature of the human spirit as she fights for her independance and knowledge. I definetely recommend this.
5,Anne Frank,...Because it seems to me that later on neither I nor anyone else will be interested in the musings of a thirteen year old schoolgirl. Anne Frank never thought that her book would becom famous and there would be movies about her (watch the movie Anne Frank the whole story). Very intresting.
5,The Greatest Diary Ever,"It tells of young Anne Frank's coming of age in a harsh, cruel world. She's living like a prisoner not being able to play in the sun like most children because of her race, Judaism. I think if you want to read something interesting about how life was for a Jewish girl during the Nazis' rule then read it. You'll realize how much Anne was alike to girls today. However if you want a fact-by-fact description of World War 2 you'll probably be disappointed. Realize that Anne wasn't writing a book about the actual war but her life.Every person should read it."
3,Not the real Diary,"I read this book as a kid and found it good enough but more of just a kids book. From my understanding, this is Otto Franks edited version in which he pics and snips through the different versions of Anne's diaries. He makes her seem much more childish than the original diaries do. Anne went back and edited her diaries in hopes of being published after the war. Try reading the Definitive edition or if you can find another. Anne Frank was a much better writer than she is given credit for and this edition is more like Illustrated Classics version instead of the real diary."
5,God Bless Annelie,"Anne's diary hits your heart right on. With wisedom beyond her years, a fighting spirit to survive, and intelligence, Anne has created one of the greatest literary masterpieces of all time. Anne with her smile, her big dark eyes, that black, thick hair, her vivacity, her cleverness, her spirit, has us all fascinated with her legacy and horrified at her fate. 'Why?' one can only inquire desperatley, one who, like me, is so young (14 years old), and it is hard to imagine ourselves enduring the fear and degredation that Anne did. On the contrary, Anne created a cheerful profile of herself, which continues to this very day to uplift everyone across the world to new heights. I love you, Anne."
3,Anne Frank - Diary of a Young Girl cassettes,The narration of the book itself was great. It brought the book to life. The tapes were used (from a library)and the sound/volume got louder and softer without anyone touching anything. There were a few parts that were so soft that you couldn't hear anything. That was disappointing.
4,Anne Frank,"Anne Frank is a fantastic book. It's about a young girl living in Germany for most of her life and then having to move to Amsterdam at the age of 5. After moving to their new home they end up having to move to another place. The place where they have to move is, an apartment right above the company where Mr. Frank works. After a while they find out that the war is getting closer to where they are hiding. The rest of the story is more interesting so you'll have to read the book for yourself. I would recommend this book because it makes you want to learn more about Anne frank."
4,Anne Frank,"In the book ""Anne Frank, (the diary of a young girl)"" 13-year -old Anne Frank and her family go into hiding in the upper story of the office building were her father previously worked due to a callup from the Nazis for her 16-year-old sister, Margot. With them in hiding are Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan and there 15-year old son Peter. Later Drussel Joins them. They all argue alot and later the Gestapo is notified about them and they are arrested.Anne Frank was 13-15 in the story. she had light brown hair and was probably about 5 ft. tall. She is a shy, sensitive and caring person who hates being copped u all the time.I think this is a good book. I would recommend reading this book to 12-13-year-olds. I thought that it was a good account of what went on during the holocaust."
5,enjoyed reading as a child,what a way to learn about the past then to read a story about a young woman's journey through the holocaust....
4,It was an OK book.,"This book was about a young teenage girl who was forced to go into hiding because she was a Jew. In hiding she foung friendship, love and hope. But the never-ending conflicts with her mother and the hatred she felt toward the Nazis made her life miserable. But dispite this all she tried to live a normal life, and she enjoyed it. This isn't a fast action book, but in the long run it was a pretty good book. J. Salbach"
5,Touching,"I am 12 and in the 6th grade and would like to say that if you are doing a report on it like i did you should not just say something like,""Anne died at age 15 in a concentration camp."" You should talk about the sad details like it was only 2 months before the war ended and she almost made,"" or something that makes you think. This book was great because it was told by Anne herself. She did not know that it would be shared so she didn't leave out anything. It is the best story that I have read so far about the holocaust."
5,This was a very moving book.,"Anne Frank was a very talented girl living in hard times. It is wonderful that such a girl would have lived in those times. I, as an adolescent, and subsequently a 13-year-old, can totally relate to her miseries. She is my hero!! Anne Frank, you rule."
4,Very Enlightening,Diary of a young girl-Anne FrankThis is about a young girl and her family going into hiding because of the Holocaust. The Jewish people were taken from their homes and put in concentration camps. Anne Frank was born in Germany in 1929. I felt sad because if black people were in that situation with some government who told us to get out our homes and we were transported to concentration camp I wouldn't know what to do and it really touched me. The way she wrote the book would make you think that she has a mind of a grown woman. She gave good details about what they had to eat what was going on with the other seven people for example like one family is fighting another family. The story she told made the characters sound very interesting I think the parts that the character play is for them and like that she put the book somewhere so her father can find it. I would recommend this book to all students that go to high school.
3,Why I Liked This Movie because is funny,The movies I was watching was very nice and sad some part its very funny the like in this movies was I thought this was expectionally wonderful I recommande this movie to anyone it was sad the part first time I saw this movie but it was to funny Anne Frank was good but she doing very well in that movie .The movie didn't stregthen the stressful point that Anne penned in diary. also ever though you know what happens at the end.
2,Dubious Authenticity,"Forensic evidence, such as proof that large portions of this ""diary"" were written with a ballpoint pen, not generally available in the years in question, has cast doubt on the authenticity of this volume. I do not purport to know if it is true or not. It is certainly moving, as is much Holocaust literature, whether authentic or fraudulent. What is far more disturbing is that merely questioning the authorship, or debating the numbers of persons killed in the Holocaust, has become a crime in much of the formerly ""Free World."" Another reviewer notes with evident approval that the French historian Robert Faurisson has been dismissed from his position, convicted, fined, and barred from employment for raising such questions. This is incredible! Is it not ironic that the freedoms we supposedly fought WW II to preserve have been erased in the name of remembering the terrors of Hitlerism?"
2,"""classic""?","So many teenage reviewers thought this book 'well-written', 'a masterpiace', 'a must-read'. The whole point of this diary's publication was to show the world that every person killed by the nazis had a personality, a family, and was just like you. Therefore, this book is about a 13-year-old jewish girl growing up in hiding. It does not concern the holocaust as the hype says. So, unless you want to read about a young girl's day-to-day life, look elsewhere."
2,Bad Book!,This was the W-O-R-S-T book I have ever read. I found it very childish and boring. The way that Anne Frank would just go on and on about her problems was really dumb. I hate this book. But that's just my opinion. You'll never know for sure until you read it yourself.
3,Anne Frank: Diary of a Young GIrl; purchase,"It was in decent shape, and not bad for the price. However, it did smell a little musty and old. I wish that hadn't been the case. I do not like to read books when they are like that...discourages me from reading it. But, I needed it for a last minute graduate school assignment and I really didn't have much choice, as there were not many other cheap options in close vicinity to my state."
2,Interesting,"Basic story of survival is always challenging and inspirational. I tried to place myself as a character in the book and could not. At one point I wanted to scream ""LOOK IN THE CLOSET!""Maybe it's me,but the book was pretty predictable."
2,Diary of Anne Frank,After visiting the home the Franks hid inside in Amsterdam I wanted to get the book. I didn't want to spend what they were asking for there so I ordered a used one and really wanted the outside of the book to look like her diary that she wrote in /red plaid. I was so dissappointed when I recieved my book and it looked nothing like the picture. Yes it is the same book but I thought I was getting the one that pictured so I was very dissapointed.
3,someone's diary is a little hard to review like a book...,"The Diary of Anne Frank tells the story of Anne Frank, a Jewish girl forced to live in hiding during the Nazi occupation of Holland during World War II. Not only does she relate how life was in hiding-forced to live in a small space for a long time, very little food, the constant fear of being discovered, and many other things-but she also writes about what it's like to be her, growing up, just like a normal girl, despite the way she was living. This is a good book, and although it may get tedious at some parts, when I was reading it I kept thinking how everything in the diary was true, that this was written from the hand of someone who had suffered all the events in the book firsthand. I would especially recommend someone who is interested in history or WWII, but really, if you just want to read a good book, then I would recommend this to you."
2,Not an Anne Frank for middle school students!,"We read Anne Frank every year in 8th grade. My students struggle with reading, so I thought the audio would be good to supplement. There is more of Anne's own language and personal thoughts than our school version, and I could not use it."
5,Anne Frank R.I.P,"She was such a nice girl ,why did she have to die? But it was a harsh time when she was living during the Natzi's attack."
4,Anne Frank Review,I think this is one of the best books I have ever read. This book really gets you into the story of the life of this young girl. reading this book was a great expirience because I got to understand how life was during the World War II. I think that every school should require students to read this book. I think this is a great book for students at the rage of highschool to read. I recommend it alot.
5,A wonderful book,"This book is really wonderful. Anne Frank is to be admired. Although she has some weaknesses, she is still strong and has spirit and hope dispite of the hell going on around her. She will live forever through her diary."
5,"An inspiration from the heart of a most loved, young Jew...","Anne Frank's diary was a contribute to her writing capabilities. She was a person who could express her deepest thoughts through a pen and paper. The inspirations of her life, hope, and faith in God will forever be imprinted in my soul. Even through her hardest times, she still considered herself to be more fortunate than others. I will always remember her, and I pray that she is now united in heaven with her family and those she truly loved."
5,Anne Frank is Excellent,A wonderful book that really takes you back to the time of the war. anne tells us everything. Your heart will pound when you read the part where bombs are being dropped near the annex.
4,An excellent book.,"This book gives an insight into the life of people who lived the war,were part of it.It not only is the story of a young girl, but of an entire nation trying to survive the consequences of war.It is a beautiful book , a must read for reeaders who prefer fact to fiction."
5,A Classic,This is a classic everyone should read. Should read it as a teenager when you can better relate... but better late than never.
5,One of the most important books of the 20th Century,"Anne Frank's legacy has become an actual personification for the worst traumatic tragedy inflicted on God's chosen people, the Jews. And it's damn interesting in iot's right too!"
3,Typical teenage diary entries,"Yes, this is an emotional book as well as worth reading.I'm just not that impressed. Anne is a typical teen-age girl with typical teen-age feelings. She writes exactly like many of today's girls do in their diary. Because you could find similar struggles in anyone's diary, I only give it three stars."
1,Anne Frank,"Anne Frank: Diary of a Young Girl was vey long. A lot of parts in it were boring. Some parts were interesting though.If the book was shorter and didn't have all the stuff on her just talking about Peter for two discs, I might have thought it was better."
1,Quite Possibly The Worst Book Ever,"Lets just start out saying, if I could I would give this book 0 stars.Recently, I had to read this book for school. Trying to get through this book was phisicaly painful. There is no plot what-so-ever. She just skips from one topic to another.This book is so boring and dry, that the most intresting part might be when she talks about peeling potatos.If I could I would burn all of the copies of this book, so people don't have to go through the hardships I did.If you have at least one brain cell, you won't buy this book."
1,Depressing read.,"Should come with a warning label, so don't pick it up if you don't want a bummer. Read it for school, didn't enjoy the experience."
2,Don't Bother With It,"While the Holocaust was a tragic event, and the fate of Anne Frank was too, this book is not the best Holocaust book. I think it is overrated and too ordinary. I understand that living in an attic is quite boring and slow, but much of the book is spent dwelling on mundane things, such as peeling potatoes and her crush. This book rarely appeals to children (they may be grossed out by some parts), and some adults even find it uninteresting. If you're looking for a truly great Holocaust book, try Night by Elie Weisel, a true work of literary genius."
1,Beware of Maple Press (India) Edition,"I purchased the paperback edition of Anne Frank's Diary from Amazon.com and received the Maple Press edition. Unbeknownst to me, this edition was published in India, and the English translation is very poor. Some of the details were also excluded in comparison to the Definitive Edition. Had to return the book and ended up buying the Definitive Ed. (hardcover)."
4,This book is a window into a young girl's heart!,"""Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl"" is a very good book. I found it very well written, so well infact that I often forgot that it was written by a young girl around my age. In this book ,(or diary)that she named ""kitty"",Anne Frank pours out her heart. She tells""kitty"" everything. She writes down her thoughts about the war, about her family and their secret hiding place, and most importantly, her hopes and dreams for after the war. This book is a window to a young girls heart. It has been translated into 31 different languages and over one million copies have been sold in hard-cover alone. If any book tells the honest fellings of a jew during the holocost , it's this one!"
4,the diary of anne frank,This product was in good condition. It served its purpose. I was thinking of an old tattered book but it was in good condition. It was delivered within a few days. I was very impressed.
3,book about a girl going through puberty during a rough time,"I don't intend to be critizing anything to do with the Holocaust because it was a terrible thing. But this book surprised me because when I started reading it, I thought it would be more like a historical account of life in those times. The book was more about Anne Frank and puberty and how life was tough living in such confined living quarters.Don't get me wrong, this book definitely gave me an idea of daily life in the Frank's family, but I was hoping she would tell more about what was going on in the world that she knew of instead of all about Peter."
3,My review of Anne Frank-The Diary of a Young Girl,"This book arrived ""wrinkled""...like it had been squeezed into a space too small. Also, the inside first (blank?) page had writing all over it in red and black ink --apparently with the previous owner's name. I guess I felt like the book was not mine!It was good to read--quite depressing, but made me more knowledgable of the plite of the Jews during the war."
4,The Diary Of A Young Girl,I really liked reading this book.But I skipped over the majority of theboring war stuff that she tends to rambleon and on about. The beginning of the bookwould probably be the best part.
3,very slow,"i prefer other holocaust books than this one. ""the diary of anne frank"" is very slow and sometimes boring. it does not show the atrocities of the holocaust, unlike other less-famous diaries. anne's might have been long, but long doesn't exactly mean good. i once read a few-page ""diary"" by an unknown child in a camp which was very good. @ least anne had her family and a roof over her head. anne did make very profound statements, but it does not show the holocaust for what it really was. anne did suffer, but not as much as others did. it can be said as inspirational, but i prefer ""night"" by elie wiesel.yes, anne frank, i believe was a good writer, but the way she wrote made it seem as if it was meant for publication or that she planned on publishing it.just my opinion."
3,Good book if you have about a million days to spare!,"Okay, so this book is supposed to be the historical diary of young Anne Frank. It is supposed to be a brilliant book writen by a young girl who hid in the back of a shop for two years. I thought this book would give lots and lots of information about World War II. Instead, I found myself reading endless acounts of the Anne and her families every move. I can not even begin to understand how she could possibly write all that down. Personally, I like suspense and lots of dramatic events in a book and this had none. I really wished she had talked more about the problems the Jewish people of her time were going through with the Nazis. So, if you want to read a book about a girl who hides in a small room for three years read it! But, if you want to read about World War II, I recomend ""Devils Arithmatic"" or ""Number the Stars""."
3,It was good in some parts and bad in others,There are parts of the diary that I like and others I don't like. Some things I like about the book is that it takes place in world war 2 and is about these people doing what ever they can t survive as long as they can.It also ends the way you don't expect. The thing I didn't like about it was that it took for ever to read. They even detailed the details.
1,This blows,This book was soo boring i read 2 pages then i burnt it. If you read this book i will personaly burn it for u....... SHe dint need to rite a fricken diary she just wanted to become famouse and she wanted people to feel sorry for her!!!!!!!
1,I don't recommend this book to anyone.....,"i had to read this book for school. I hate it. It is a very bad book, i don't recommend this book to anyone. I don't like this book at all. It is a book of the past. I am interested in the present and the future. Some people may like history, and some people may like this book but i don't. My quote for this book is ""Different strokes for different folks."" Some folks may like this book but if your forced to read it you won't like it at all, i promise. i might have liked it a lot more if i wasn't forced to read it.My Rating for this book is 0/100"
2,Not like the one in HS,"One thing I love about true story books-especially Anne Frank- is the pictures throughout the book. I know, sounds juvenile, but usually there's a couple. I was kind of bummed, havent started reading it yet, but will soon. It's a good book though"
4,Pretty Good!,"I received the book about a week earlier than it was supposed too :D, but still a month after I ordered it-- I suppose since it came from the United Kingdom it took awhile. The book was DEF. used, the pages are yellow, and the top is faded. Overall, it's what they said it would be, and the book is readable."
5,Review of anne franks diary,this bok was a great read and was really interesting.the only problem was that it was ( in some parts ) a bit embarrasing to read aloud when i was aske to !i would highly reccomend this book and hope you will like it as much as i do !!!!
3,The Diary of Anne Frank,"The Diary of Anne Frank tells the story of Anne Frank, a Jewish girl forced to live in hiding during the Nazi occupation of Holland during World War II. Not only does she relate how life was in hiding-forced to live in a small space for a long time, very little food, the constant fear of being discovered, and many other things-but she also writes about what it's like to be her, growing up, just like a normal girl, despite the way she was living. This is a good book, and although it may get tedious at some parts, when I was reading it I kept thinking how everything in the diary was true, that this was written from the hand of someone who had suffered all the events in the book firsthand. I would especially recommend someone who is interested in history or WWII, but really, if you just want to read a good book, then I would recommend this to you."
4,The Diary of a young Jew,"In the book Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl, a young Jew goes into hiding with her family and another family. This is an interesting book because I saw how Anne felt while in hiding. She had just become a teenager when Margot (her sister) got a deportation notice. At once they moved into hiding. There were a total of eight people in the ""Secret Annexe"". During Anne's time in the ""Secret Annexe"", she battled her changing feelings. She could not surmount them and at once fell in love with Peter. This is a tragedy for all Jews. When they were discovered by Gestapos, the unfortunate eight were sent to a concentration. All of them died except for Mr. Frank. He lived to publish Anne's diary for the rest of the world to know what had happened. I would recommend this book to the history fans and anyone who would like to know what has happened during this unpeaceful time."
4,This book really gave me insight to what it's like. . .,"Anne Frank was a girl like myself when she underwent the torment of World War 2. She loved her movie Stars, she was a chatterbox and had many admirers. It explained what girls of her age thought at the time of the war and other matters. It was sad but she was so inspiring to me. . .she was so optimistic and found her faults and improved! The reason for me giving this 4 stars is because many parts in the book had nothing to do with the war or hiding and some parts were grotesque. (I also got the inmpression that she was a lesbian.) I would recommend this book especially to girls between the ages of 11 - up (and adults) To really get what's going on you must read the WHOLE book from cover to cover. Read it! It ROCKS!"
4,Megan. Mrs. McIntyre 3rd per.,I really enjoyed this book. Because it told me about the times back then. In history books they dont tell you alot. And in this book it told me things that I never knew. I enjoyed this book. And plan on watching the video I taped!
5,An extrodianary story from such a terrifing war.,"I thought that this story was a delightful yet tragic time period. I felt as if Anne was talking to the reader and not the diary called kitty. Anne Frank was a brave young women to have not been emotionaly depressed through the whole ordeal. It would be hard to have to stay in hiding today. Especially a young aldult or teenager with alot of energy. This book was pleasent to read. I only would want to read, ""The Last seven Months,"" to find out how she lived and died in the concentration camps."
5,Greatly moving and inspiational.,"The Diary of Anne Frank is an incredible book that will leave the reader examining their own soul, ready to look beyond hate themselves, and with a sense of great loss that Anne was killed at such a young age. Anne speaks truthfully and with astounding insight, inspiring you to find beauty in the world and within yourself. Many people have said, ""It is terrible that Anne died so young because she could have really given something to the world."" I believe that she has--Anne gave the world hope, inspiration, and strength through her diary. Almost anyone who reads it will finish this book as a better person."
5,A Young Girl and the her Experiences During the Holocaust,"The intimate diary Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl, published several years after Anne Frank's death, is a candid recount of the personal experiences Anne Frank, a young Jewish girl, went through during the Holocaust. Confiding in Kitty, her diary, Anne Frank has detailed descriptions of her living situation and emotional state while living in hiding. Throughout the diary, Anne Frank explains the hardships she encounters because she is Jewish and how her life has changed because of the Nazis' genocide against Jews. As a result of her experience in hiding, Anne Frank is able to understand her relationships with those around her and evaluate herself. This book is of tremendous historical importance, as through the words of a young girl those lost during the Holocaust are remembered."
4,Only in the Annefrankhaus,"This special slipcase hardcover edition of The Diary of a Young Girl imitates the cover of Anne Frank's original diary. It is a very sturdy and handsome binding with nice, ""stick to your fingers"" type of pages--great for reading and displaying.The text is very bold, big (but not too big--maybe size 14?)and evenly spaced to provide for an easy reading experience. Though I'm not going to go too much into the diary itself (it's just as the other editions), I can say that I wasn't too big on the first half of her journal entries.This version of the book can only be purchased in Amsterdam, and it cost quite the Euro. Still, though, after traveling through her house and viewing the actual diary itself, I couldn't resist purchasing the rare (not so rare if you're in Amsterdam) edition of The Diary of a Young Girl."
4,Great GPS -- needs more memory,"I love my Garmin GPC60C. I struggled with my ETrex for a long time and I'm finally glad I got a decent mapping GPS. I picked this over the Magellan Meridian.Pros: Lightweight, excellent color, easy to see outdoors in daylight, VERY VERY fast, picks up satellites quickly. Mine shipped with a USB cable, so thats a plus. Software only supported Windows, so my Mac sits idle with this one. Has external satellite input, serial input with power, waterproof.Cons: Hey Garmin! Ever hear of expandability? Thats the only feature missing! Great GPS, but you blew it because it only has 56MB of data. Now granted, thats a LOT of memory, but if you're planning a cross-country trip, I'd like a little more please! I'm sure there was enough room in there to include a SD card slot -- Magellan does!Other than the 56MB limitation, its a rock solid GPS. I highly recommend this GPS to anybody looking for a good mapping GPS."
3,GPSMAP60C,i really like this unit but I have no idea on how to download maps to it or update it. I constantly am using it but like I said I have no main maps of any citys. I only have major high ways and well that is the problem. I would like to be able to see everything not just guess on streets when I am out and about geocaching.
3,Incompatible with 64-bit XP,If your using a 64 bit OS you will not be able to download maps to unit until Garmin provides driver support. Other then this it's a great product!
5,Loved it before I even got it,"I had read quite a few of the online reviews for this GPSr and realized there wasn't much negative about it. I was right, and I think I made a good investment. Although this model has been updated with an expandable, this one I found new for under $300 and it does the trick for what I need.The unit performs flawlessly. I even can get a fairly good position - in my office with no windows! The quadrifilar helix antenna really is the key to this GPSr's ability to get fast, accurate fixes even under dense coverage. I don't live in an extremely dense urban area with tall buildings, so I cannot attest to its use in that environment. I have noticed (and read somewhere, if I recall) that the GPS receives best in the vertical position. On its side or holding screen up, the signal degrades. The helicoil antenna must be polarized to be held vertically.All in all, it's a great unit for the price, and still worth the purchase even though it is being outdated by newer models."
4,Love My 60C,"HI purchased the Garmin 60C to replace my old Garmin GPS3+. Thought the newer unit would be more accurate for geocaching. Actually do not really see much better results. My wife's Etrex reads about the same at cache sites. I DO however love the 60C's features and maping. It is so much easier to use than the 3+ and the geocaching features are useful. The maping capabilities are great with City Select, but worthless with the basemap. The color display is nice, but really not necessary. Too bad Garmin cannot include a good map program with this unit and forces one to spend $100+ more. A good map program should be included considering what this unit sells for. A great easy to use unit."
5,Garmin 60C is a great product,"I bought this product in December 2004 mainly to use for snowmobiling. I have used this product snowmobiling in the Arrowhead of Minnesota, and the U.P of Michigan. I have ridden thru multiple national forests, using the ""tracking"" option, and this device has yet to lose a signal; all while being placed inside my upper, inside pocket of my coat! The display is fantastic and the processor is real time. It's unbelievable how well this unit works. I also purchased the TOPO map to run on this unit and cannot believe the detail of these maps. If you are an outdoorsman, this is the unit and software you need to buy. Works great in the car as well..."
2,"OK, but not perfect!",My first GPS. It was pretty expensive and had lots of nice features (ability to save many tracks). The software is very US-centric.It worked very well on the flat and in unwooded conditions. However don't use one of these things to navigate in the bush (use a compass). The technology is just not there to cope with either valleys or an overhead canopy. It was handy to confrm where I was when I found a clearing on top of a hill. Finally although the battery life is better than most it is still abysmal.In summary these things are still a toy for a tramper rather than an essential tool.
5,5 years of field use,"I've used this GPS for everything from hiking, backpacking, thousands of hours of back country SAR missions, mountain biking and general trail mapping. It has never failed me. Batteries last quite awhile when setup properly. Buy a case to protect the screen."
4,Garmin GPSMap 60cs,"This GPS is a pretty good deal for the money. From an operational standpoint, it works well. It is apparent though, this is really all about being portable, the screen is too small for good marine or car use. For my use, mostly marine, I set a lot of waypoints and scrolling on this tiny of a screen is just lame. Not any fault of the unit I know, just something to think about."
3,Not safe but help you get away from tickets,"Products like this are not safe. Your child are not restrained properly in the seat with this booster. For daily use, you should really get a real booster. However, this product works if you have to fly to a place and drive away in a rental car.For maximum safety, you should really get car seats that fit the size of your child. My recommendation, if budget is allowed, buy an infant carrier for 5-20 lb than a 20-40 lb car seat, than a real booster for the range of 40-80 or 100lb. I have 2 convertable car seats that claim to work from 5 lb to 100 lb but I don't think they are safe at all. It is the life of your child that we are talking about."
3,"Stupid movies, great presentation","Yup, this movie is total nonsense. If youre looking at this page, you probably know what youre getting into though as far as content. Definitely has some humorous moments.As always, Something Weird's presentation is faultless; theyre one of the best companies around for this kind of movie market. Great looking print, lots of extras.So, my rating is thus: 1/2 a star per movie (since there are two in this set) and 2 stars for Something Weird's presentation."
3,Not Wishmans Best,Its Ok --- But What Quality Control Doris Had In The Begining ---- Is Long Lost By This Movie ---- The Chick Has Big Cans ---- I Never Though I Would Hear These Words Out Of My Mouth --- To Big ---- It Was The 70s ---Everybody Was On Drugs ---- This Movie Proves It---
4,"Double the pleasure, double the fun","This DVD is a Chesty Morgan double feature. Both are low budget guilty pleasures. Who doesn't want to watch in anticipation of Chesty Morgan removing her top and bra whatever the situation. In ""Deadly Weapons"" she uses her big soft 'weapons' to avenge the murder of her boyfriend by some two bit gangsters. In ""Double Agent 73"" (I can guess what the 73 is for) she goes after a secret spy ring to catch their leader using a hidden camera to document her progress. Guess where the camera is hidden."
3,"A few good articles, but most of the info is on the net","This is really an expanded magazine issue. It has a few good articles - ""Smart Degrees for the Real World"", ""Part-times Rule"" - but it is mostly just a ranking of various types of graduate programs. There are also some statistics on each individual school and academic program (tuition, application deadlines, etc.) but almost all schools have a website where you can get the most up-to-date information. Given its statistics-oriented bias, this guide doesn't give much guidance on how to chose one school over another. You won't find helpful information like class descriptions or student comments. Better to buy one of the guides for the specific type of graduate school you're considering."
3,"Maybe ""Best Professional Schools 2002""","I purchased this publication to give to a daughter graduating from a liberal arts college. She is unsure of what to pursue in graduate school because her interests are so diverse. This book is mainly concerned with Law Schools, Medical Schools, Engineering Schools, Business Schools, and Schools of Education (not sure how that one squeezed in with all the other ultimate big salary options). While she could do well in any of those professional schools, that's not where her interests lie. I wish it had more information about more diverse programs. There is a very small section that covers the huge diversity of ""other"" Graduate Programs. If you know you want to go to Law School, Med school, or get an MBA, this will be useful. If you are undecided or have a multidisciplinary bent, this is much less useful."
5,I'd Rather Be Dead....,"this cd is straight up FRESHthe main themes on here are: Suicide,murder,death,pain,broken heart,drugs,acid trips,and just pure sorrow.....yet its not a lame whimpy NU METAL cd....its like kiss,except darker...and much more fun and evil! :)like manson in 1994 was.....exactly almostcheck out DX28 on the web at:Dead By 28 . NetandDead By 28 . comB4 RECORDS . COMplease buy this CD you WONT regret it!(unless your a lil pansy @$$ heh)"
5,Best Indy CD Of 2002,a friend of mine sent me a sampler for this cd a few months ago and before the sampler was over i was online ordering the cd. within a few weeks i started to amke a fan site. i dont take to new bands very well but these guys are the band i have been looking for! i can play this cd from track 1 to track 16 non stop without skiping a single song. how many cds can you say that about? not many! pick this one up and you will not be let down.
3,it's okay,"I love the way it works, love the way it sounds, but the front where the different options are is so dark and hard to read that I need extra light to work it. The remote helps alot, over all I wish I had looked at it before purchasing it, but that's my fault, not the company."
3,Strong but started to fall apart,"I used this product to hold my sleeping bag to the outside of my pack while hiking. I bought the marine grade straps hoping that they would hold up well to the elements.The straps are very strong and function perfectly, but they are starting to fall apart. The soft side of the velcro is getting nappy and the edges are fraying. That all being said, I haven't noticed any decrease in strength, it just looks a little shabby."
5,The best of any nursing magazine.,"I have never subscribed to any nursing magazines before. I always felt that they weren't very practical for my job in the ER as a RN. Well, this is the best nursing magazine that I have ever read. The articles are very informative and well written, hence the name of the magazine. I have gained valuable knowledge reading the articles. Any new and experienced nurse should read and subscribe to this magazine."
3,BAD SERVICE,"I have read so many comments about this publisher and the customer service they offer. As a recent nursing graduate, my father ordered me a gift subscription to AJN & Nursing Made Incredibly Easy in JULY. In one weeks time, AJN sent me April, May, June & July issues. Nursing Made Easy sent me Jan/Feb, March/April, May/June issues. This made me so upset! AJN had my subscription to expire in Mar & Nursing Made Easy had my ending in Jan/Feb. I called both magazines customer service (the number is printed in the front of both magazines) and they changed my subscription to expire in July (which is when it should have started & ended). I can't believe that these magazines do this. Everyone who has experienced these problems should call customer service and make them make it right!!!!!"
3,Nursing made incredibly easy,I was disappointed when Iordered a subscription that was to start in January 2007 and I received several magazines at once dating back to last summer. I feel half of my money went toward getting rid of their leftover copies. The magazine itself has good content.
4,Great for the Student or Beginner....or for the RN who wants to keep refreshed/renewed,"As an RN of over 30 years experience (HOW did THAT happen?) I have to say that the ""Incredibly Easy"" books and magazine seem ideal for students and new nurses. AND for those of us who need brushing up on this or that area where we may not normally work.I like the humor, the cartoons, the easy catch phrases....all RN journals do not have to be dry as dust (are you listening AJN?) and appear to be in competition with MD journals. Nor should they exist to help people trying to earn PH.D's or get tenure be able to say they have ""published""....sorry, but that IS what goes on in some areas of RN journals/ writing.I'd recommend this to anyone thinking about RN school, in school, or in their first years of the profession."
2,Only rec'd 2 of the six magazines,The two magazines I did receive were very informative. However I never received the last 4. I've made an attempt to contact them 2x via their web site as there is no other way to contact them. I have not been successful
2,mediocre,"While the nursing magazines that are out there do not leave a lot of choice, I decided to try a subscription to a ""new"" nursing magazine that I'd not received perviously. I'm not entirely satisfied with my choice. First of all........I received both Sept./Oct, and Nov./Dec. both within 1 week......in January. I HATE when you order a new subscription and thay perceive you don't care about receiving OLD magazines. When I subscribe.....a subscription should start with the NEWEST UPCOMING copy!! Especially when this magazine is only printed bi-monthly!!! The content is ok.....no better or worse than the other nursing magazine I was receiving monthly."
1,Let Me Die A Woman,I have yet to receive this movie item. What is the delay? It was ordered back in December before Christmas!
3,Weird film for sure!,Let Me Die a Woman is pure grindhouse trash about transexuality. It pretends to be a documentary but is really just exploitative like Mondo Cane. It is also hilarious trash! Not for everyone though and quite gross at times.
5,What would Jesus do?,"Mr. Wakefield has done an admirable job in depicting the ""war"" being waged for the heart and soul of Christianity in America today. The book is highly provovative and bound to anger many on the far right whose highly selective perception of Christ's teachings are enough to make one wonder why he was called the ""Prince of Peace"" and not the god of war."
4,The Hijacking of Jesus,"This is a quick read of important issues in today's America. There are valuable facts and insights in today's religious climate. The author bounces around a bit, but comes back to sound an alarm for thinking people of faith."
2,Read the dementions,"Sorry, but this book is a little pricey for its size. Compact? Try wallet sized."
3,clara ward,"i was pleased that a book has finally been written about the ward singers. clara ward and the ward singers contributed much to the gospel sound. they were a major force in gospel music during the 1950's. this book is very reveals a lot of private information about clara ward and the ward family. mother ward was obviously in desperate need of psychaitric counseling. the book is very interesting and sure keeps you turning the page. It was very shocking to me to learn of clara's sexuality and alcoholism, but none the less she was a great performer. I do wish that willa had included better photographs of clara ward, because the ones that are in the book are not the most attractive. Also, I think the book is a little overpriced."
4,Clara Ward-Praise to God,"I met Clara Ward in the '50s. I was impressed by her singing and her backup singers. I first saw her as a warm up group for Mitzi Gaynor at Melodyland, and later at Disneyland. I was impressed with the soul she had when she sang the Gospel Songs that gave me inspiration. I have never.'shouted' , but when she sang:It is no Secret What GOD Can Do' I was ready to shout. Let me tell you that I am a not an Afican American, but the soul she put in her song made me want to shout. Clara was the greatest Gospel singer that ever lived."
1,Watch Only Good as a Watch,I thought that getting a heart rate with just wearing a watch sounded like a great idea.This watch was not at all accurate. It also reads your heart rate when it feels like it-not quickly.Guess I'll go back to wearing the belt around my chest.
2,Bulkier than it looks,"I thought this watch would be OK for my wife, and it did not look that big in the picture. So, I bought it and it was definetely bigger than I expected it to be. The Heart Rate function works OK, but you have to be standing and wait for a while to come up, so, if you exercise at fast rates (running, biking) this is not a good solution. It works well for those who walk or hike.I ended up giving it to my mom. She walks and does not mind the large size of the watch."
4,Works well with one quirk,European standard date and time is hard to get used to but watch works great
4,"Works well, just what I needed to monitor my heart rate.",Did not want a chest band so this watch was ideal for my needs.
1,Great in theory.... Useless in practice,"I agree with my fellow reviewer that the watch is not worth buying, but my reasons are slightly different. It sort of works when you're resting and stationary, i.e. it gives you a reasonably accurate reading after 5+ seconds of pressing your fingers on to the sensors. When you are running, it doesn't work, i.e. you can follow your heartbeat in the form of a blinking cursor on the screen, but you never obtain a reading - which makes it completely useless for my purposes of monitoring my heartbeat to ensure I am not starting too fast at the beginning of a race."
2,Not worth it,Impossible to use while running.. You'll have your fingers on it forever trying for it to read your pulse... probably would work for a less strenious activity.
3,They were Beatlesque when Beatlesque wasn't cool,"Badfinger made good, Beatley, pop music after the Beatles broke up, but before the advent of power pop. The fact that they were holdovers makes their popularity more remarkable. A half-dozen first-class singles are gathered here along with representative cuts from Badfinger's four albums. A neat surprise is their original version of ""Without You"", which is to Nillson's hit version as Traffic's original of ""Feelin' Alright"" is to Joe Cocker's hit version. The casual listener to classic rock/oldies radio is likely to have heard ""Come and Get It"", ""No Matter What"", and ""Day After Day"", for which the band is deservedly famous. The rest of the disc is mildly entertaining guitar pop, making for good background music. Sad to say, listening to an hour of Badfinger just isn't as enjoyable as being surprised by one of their great singles on the radio in the car. Buy this, and make a road tunes tape out of the best bits."
1,Didn't sound like the music I listened to as a teen,"Really week remakes of some great tunes. No feeling. Lead on Day After Day just doesn't have the range. Struggles through some crucial moments. Where can I get some of the real thing? If anybody knows, drop me an email."
1,Simply Not a Good Read,"This is a poorly written book, that goes nowhere. There is no real story telling. Just a ramble, a family journey with little or no joy. As a reader it's my habit to see all books through to completion. So it was a relief to have the Jacobson's end their journey.If you want any idea about the practicalities of such a trip with your family, you won't find it here."
4,Dance the night away,"This is a collection of dance tunes covering the seventies through the early nineties and ranging from disco and soul to new wave and club. These tracks were chart toppers in any combination of the pop, R&B; or dance charts-some, all three. ""Celebration"" by Kool & The Gang and Irene Cara's ""Fame"" are in their LP versions and ""Breakin..There's No Stopping Us"" by Ollie & Jerry is a track from the breakdancing craze of the mid eighties. The eco friendly packaging is very unique-these titles are packaged in recycled board and biodegradable trays. At least you won't have to worry about replacing jewel cases.If you like dance music then you'll enjoy this great collection. It will keep you dancing all throughout. If not, then something's wrong with you."
5,A Proper Review?,"I am amazed this record does not have a proper review. This is the only release - aleast known to me - of this late 1960's Greek psychedelic band... I believe the record was released in 1967. Do not let the term psychedelic turn you away, this is a solid 1960's recording, by a really inspired band. Some of the best guitar work i have heard. This is no Door's spoiler, where you sort the album for a few gems(with the doors one gem), this record is not as lost, as a Grateful Dead record, and this band would never have to try as hard as an Ultimate Spinach. This is classic music of the 1900's, and if there were one record i would take with me out of 1960's, this is it. This record stand's alone, next to, Band of Gypsy's, After Bathing at Baxter's, Chrysalis's 'Definition', Disraeli Gears, The Stooges S/T, and Flower Travelin' Band..."
3,Four Levels Of Existence - self-titled (Lion Productions),"Obscure Greek psychedelic band's sole effort - originally released in 1976, in a very small quantity on the Venus label. That's why an actual lp copy is so tough to come by. Lion Productions - then years later reissued it on CD limited edition of 1,000. I do like what I'm hearing. Tunes that I got the most out of include ""Metamorphic"", ""The Village Postman"" (reminds me of the Mutants), ""The Fool's Trumpet"", ""Child's Song"" and the lp closer ""Someday In Athens"". Line-up: Nick Grapsas - lead guitar & vocals, Marios Yamalakis - bass & vocals, Athanasios Alatas - rhythm & acoustic guitar and Christos Vlahakis - drums. Should appeal to fans of Aphrodite's Child, Ultimate Spinach and possibly T2 or even The Strawbs."
1,Disappointed...,"Purchased the 725r with the trimmer plus straight shaft attachment. Really liked the speed spool feature. The gear box is very weak, broke mine in the first month. Bought a replacement straight shaft attachment and that one lasted only two weeks. ROYBI will not even return my call let alone replace the broken unit. Don't even waste your time on this model."
5,"Ryobi? I have been pleased, here's why.","I have been VERY SATISFIED. I have never purchased 'regular' Ryobi merchandise and maybe that is why I have been so pleased. My Ryobi 2-cycle trimmer and all of my attachments are what is called 'FACTORY RECONDITIONED, FACTORY PERFECT' Basically they have been inspected manually by a person and fine tuned and checked for any problems and those problems have been fixed. My first Ryobi 2-cycle trimmer I ran hard, about 10 hours a week for an entire summer. It made me so much money and it isn't even a commercial unit. Guess what, it STILL RUNS and tears through the same stuff it could from the start. Surprisingly, 'FACTORY RECONDITIONED, FACTORY PERFECT' units sell for cheaper than 'regular' units. This is because people are weary of purchasing them because they don't understand that they are not seconds. Buy a 'FACTORY RECONDITIONED, FACTORY PERFECT' unit and it will be one of the best trimmers you can own."
1,Cheap trimmer,I would not buy a Ryobi product again. The gearbox stripped out so it's useless. The strings get jammed in the string head. The junk lasted 1 1/2 seasons.
2,trouble with string head,"engine great. starts and runs well. I got a couple of good years use from the string head ,then wear caused a problem where the string would all release at once making a snarl at the head and being unusable with any decent lenght line.I have just purchased spare parts ($70)and am disgusted as with replacement spool and bump head, it still acted up on the first usage.I think there is slight wear on the ratchet mechanism and it angles to release the spool all the way instead of catching when bumped. I don't want to buy an entire replacement head unit, I also don't want to waste valuable tine on a dffcult to work on unit.The Ryobi didn't last long enough to be a god buy. My old IDC unit lasted for years and accommodated thicker line to boot. Don't bother with line less than 0.095 as it disappears too fast."
2,Weak drive-train,I really liked the Ryobi operation while it lasted - the upper drive-shaft twisted off after about 30-40 hours. I replaced it and after a day's use the gear-box ground to a halt! I now have a nice parts department in my garage and have ordered more. Next time I get a new one it will be an Echo.
1,Roybi Gas Trimmer Won't Start,I bought this trimer 6mos ago and now it won't start i need a book on it to find out where things are on it. Taying to find the gas filter.
1,Gear Box is Junk,I purchased the Troy-Bilt version of this (both Troy-Bilt and Ryobi are manufactured by MTD) Trimmer-Plus gizmo - looked good. The gear box gears (which allows for the 'straight-shaft') lost their teeth after about 2 months of light use. Came in here to see what a new 'trimmer attachment' cost since I hate to lose the whole thing - excellent and reliable engine.
2,it's not her best... but I still believe in her!!!,"yes, Let me be is not the wonderful magic of Rasha's debut, Sudaniyat, but is not bad, dont mind. Surely a singer cannot be martyred for only a disc that wasnt that brilliant... an incredible debut as Sudaniyat is very complicated to surpass, but i believe in her talent and just cannot leave her wonderful voice... i'm gonna wait for her next album and still love Rasha's work."
1,Trying to figure out what is going on........,"I cannot understand why there are so many conflicting reviews with this perfume. Then it dawned on me................my bottle that I have is at least 10 years old. THEY ARE WATERING DOWN THE PERFUME SO BAD NOW THAT ITS GETTING TO THE POINT OF RIDICULOUS!!!!!!! Im not spending my hard earned money on perfume that is watered down. I so wanted another bottle of this perfume but not like it is. These perfume distributors think WOMEN ARE STUPID AND DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE!!!! you are looking at loosing everything you have by doing this to the perfume, I would rather pay more for my perfume at good quality then spend my hard earned money on GARBAGE!!!! PERFUME MANUFACTURES, LISTEN TO THIS LOUD AND CLEAR, THE WOMEN DO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE!!!!!! YOU CAN KISS YOUR COMPANY GOODBYE BY DOING THIS!!!!!!!"
2,Fragrant only for a moment,I love the fragrant smooth clean smell of this eau de perfume but when worn- it only lasts a moment. I even tried spraying some on my scarf thinking the fabric could hold the fragrance- but it too quickly vanished. Perhaps the Eau de Parfume has a bit too much water and not enough scent- definately would not purchase this again even if it was very inexpensive. Kind of a waste of time if it evaporates and disappears quickly.
5,"Paradise, yum!","Paradise Perfume by Alfred Sung, its light refreshing and everytime I smell it I feel sensual. I absolutly love this fragrance, Its hard to find and I found it here at AMAZON for a fraction of what I used to pay for it. It was shiped and delivered just as promised."
2,Better Fragrances Available,"Sung Paradise is a fruity, white floral that is bright, sunny and fun. I like a scent like this for winter wear. Although it's pleasant enough, it's not very long-lasting. There are similar, tropical-themed fragrances that are better than Sung Paradise but just as affordable. EL Brasil Dream and LC Bora Bora immediately come to mind."
3,It's..................OK,"The scent is above subpar. It has sort of a weird sweet and woodsy smell. I have to combine different scents so as not to offend. I just spray lightly and combine a scent such as Green Tea by Estee Lauder or Delicious by Fred Hayman (?), and I'm O.K. for human contact."
1,Unplayable CD,"I ordered this CD from Amazon LLC .It arrived in a timely fashion well packaged.When I tried to play the music on the item it was unplayable ,it sounded like it had been dragged accross a stony road.It was described as ""New"" by Amazon.You hear horror stories but the last company you'd expect to provide this rubbish would have been Amazon.I will never again buy anything from Amazon if this is what it calls customer service.The item was Spirit in the Dark by Aretha Franklin (**P-3-B3E166**)BOOOOO335K"
3,"Do Play That Song, Aretha","For me the highlight of this album is ""Don't Play That Song,"" which is, for me, one of Aretha's best-ever hits. Even though it's a song about heartache, there's a joyful, celebratory quality that makes one want to dance. Some of the other tracks bordered on the sentimental, such as ""OH No Not My Baby, ""You and Me"", and ""That's All I want From You."" There are a couple other songs that are enjoyable, but don't have the same intensity of ""Don't Play That Song,"" which is a must-have."
4,"(3.5 stars) Great when she explores her roots, questionable otherwise","A generally amusing exploration of Aretha's roots: gospel (the exciting title track; the complex ""Pullin'""), blues (a moving cover of ""The Thrill is Gone""; ""Honest I Do""; ""Why I Sing the Blues""), and, of course, some R&B (the hit ""Don't Play That Song (You Lied)"", sung with enthusiasm; ""When This Battle is Over"", notable for Duane Allman's guitar licks). So far so good, right? Well, here's the problem: there are some terrible ideas on this record. In fact, they're more abundant on any preceding Franklin record but Soul '69, I'd wager. Some sap (""That's All I Want from You""; ""Oh No, Not My Baby""; ""You and Me"") - Franklin's ballads are massive hit-or-miss deals. Some of the stock-in-trade R&B isn't too good either: ""Try Matty's"" is an odd ode to a drug dealer; and believe me, you've heard a billion better songs than ""One Way Ticket"" that basically did the same thing."
3,Aretha Franklin Spirit In The Dark,"Even though this is not among her best Albums,she has proven that she can still work under pressure given the fact what was going on in her life around this time.There are still some Highlights such as Pullin,You And Me,and Spirit In The Dark."
5,Soul In the pocket,Listen this is a great album. Aretha plays piano on each tune which in itself is a treat. Side One is a jewel...I have 2000 records and I come back to this one alot. I actually have it on vinyl and came here to buy it for a friend.The band is so in the pocket...if you are a musician trying to feel it...this is a good teacher.
5,My wife LOVES THIS!!!!,This necklace is firm and holds its rounded shape. It's a cool idea but not what I expected. Thanks for the fast shipping.
1,Another Reason Kansas Sucks,"Influenced by good bands, but the musicianship is horrible. I listened as long as I could, then I removed the disc and buried it in my backyard.The singer has the most annoying rappity-rock voice I have ever heard.But what do you expect in Kansas?"
2,This Honey sure isn't sweet,"*First off, Robert Palmer's death (9/26) broke my heart but I can't let that cloud my mind. So here's my review:I'm sorry but I have to say that this was Robert's worst album. Now don't get me wrong, I am and always will be a Palmer fan but Honey didn't do it for me. It lacked heart, was over-produced and his usual wit seemed forced by his song choices. The title tracks Honey A & B were mismatch he should've chose either one or the other instead of using both but neither were good. The DEVO cover is OK and ""Know by now"" should've been a hit but the more `metal' tracks ""Big Trouble"" and ""Wham bam boogie"" left me cold. I bought this CD because of two songs ""You're mine"" and ""Love takes time"" and they're STILL the only songs I liked from this album. Maybe it's me but I don't know why everyone gave Honey four or five stars, but for me Honey was too bitter to swallow."
2,"Life, Love, Romance",Was hopeful regarding this set only to be greatly disappointed. The production quality on these are HORRIBLE. Looks like some kid in a basement pirated tv movies and burned to dvd. Every film is out of focus. Over half have repeat issues... you see a section of the film and then it repeats the same scene. One film had big sections that cut in and out with blank spaces between cuts. For the price I didnt expect award winning movies...I did expect basic quality of production.
4,Another Good Game From Big Fish,"There is a crime spree in Huntsville. You must prove your worth as a detective. Also, there might be a link among the various crimes.While I consider Mystery Case Files (MCF):Madame Fate and Ravenhearst to be the some of the best MCF games, Huntsville is another quality entry in the series. Mostly a hidden object game, there are no puzzles just a picture to piece together to reveal each criminal. There is a time limit to each section.I am playing Huntsville through for a second time."
4,Happy with product,No more holding up manually!! No more getting smashed :) These are very easy to install. Extremely happy with this product.
3,Amazon needs to update version info for this,"The picture shows ver 26, the text says version 25, and Florida Contractor's License Board says to use version 27. Which are you sending to customers, Amazon. Florida is very specific and Amazon needs to pay attention to details like this. I find same problem with other listed used book vendors who don't state edition or version numbers."
2,Not much more than the manual,This book is the camera manual plus some almost useless information. Not very helpful!
3,A little bit more than the factory manual,I didn't find it THAT usefull. Just a little bit better than the original manual.The big differences aren't really as big as stated... and there's nothign that you can't find on the internet or in a basic photography book. For me it doesn't goo DEEPLY into the camera functions or give real life use samples.
1,Better Information is available on the www.,"The book reads more like a "" Idiot's guide to ..."". Some superficial information is given about how to use partial metering, A-dep field preview and some of the creative zone exposure modes. I understand manual is a bit cryptic. Look to the internet for better help with this camera. The camera is an excellent piece with more potential than explained in the book."
5,Canon EOS Rebel 2000,A very good consice book. A great help in helping you learn all the great things this camera is capable of. Film cameras are still alive!! Bravo!!
1,Too confusing,I lost the small book that came with the camera and I bought this one. I found it too confusing for on-the-spot consulting in the field while I was trying the camera out.
4,Replace your user manual with this book,"I am new to photography. After I purchased my first SLR (Rebel 2000), I was unhappy with the user manual that came with my camera. The user manual does not explain what each setting does in detail, rather it explains it in one or two sentences. I knew I need more information. I am glad I purchased this book and would recommend it highly to anyone who is new to photography. I also bought the Magic Lantern Guides to Canon Lens. I DON'T feel that it was worth buying it since it was published in 1995 and is missing some of the newer lenses. The Magic Lantern Guides Canon EOS Rebel 2000 explains a lot of Canon's newer lenses."
4,A good buy for a novice,"I think this is a good book for the price for novice photographers toying with the world's best selling SLR.I discovered my rebel after reading the book. It is very helpful in knowing more about advanced features like spot metering, depth of field preview.A beginner must get this book."
4,Beats the Manual!,"Being new to the SLR-world, I bought this book because the owner's manual was horrible. I was absolutely clueless with the SLR lingo (aperture, shutter speed, f-stop, etc.)Although this manual was a great help, I would still recommend the novice user to sign up for a course at the local community college or through the county, if such programs are available in their area. I took a 10-week class through my county's recreation center that was very helpful. Nevertheless, I still reference this handy booklet from time to time and the compact size makes it easy to carry around; mine lives in my camera bag."
3,Great Book with 1 HUGE Flaw,"This book is very clear and concise in teaching the basics of music theory. Each chapter is followed with excercises to apply your knowledge and each group of 3 or so chapters has even more excercises reviewing the topics covered in the past 3 or so chapters. There was one HUGE problem however. NO ANSWER KEY!!! Why anyone would make a book like this and not give an answer key is beyond me. It's easy to learn from this book, but how do you know if you've mastered the material if you can't check your work? If you can find someone to check your work get this book, otherwise I would look elsewhere for a book with an answer key."
3,Great Book But,"The book is great if you're in a classroom with an instructor to correct the practice tests that are all throughout the book. The book is meant to be used in schools, and in that setting, it is hard to beat. All they had to do was include a page or two with the answers and possibly perforate them so depending on the situation it could be removed or left in. If you don't care about the answers to the practice tests, it's great."
4,411 on theory,"ok, I just recently bought this Berklee Book on music theory. Even though I have a strong theory foundation, this book covered a lottle more material than what I learned in school! It teaches the basics such as note placement to chord structures. I strongly recommend this book to those who write songs or can play an instrument."
4,"Good, but you'll still need a teacher","Both this and Music Theory Book No. 2 are simple, fast and pretty clear... they have some good examples, but they are not so in-depth that you will learn music theory just by buying this book alone. I'm currently taking private lessons with a music teacher so this book is a good aid in helping me understand everything a little better, plus the topics are very well organized. I suggest you also take a look into the Auralia software if you can't afford private lessons."
4,Berklee Music Theory Book 1,"No Answer key! I'm fortunate enough to have a teacher helping me but if you don't it can be frustrating. Otherwise, covers a lot of ground in both books. I wouldn't buy through Amazon again, it took a long time to get after placing the order."
3,Music Theory Book,"This text is adequate for a beginning music student to start to comprehend the subject, but there aresome mistakes and poor presentation to be noted. The relationship between minor keys and relative minorkeys is badly explained(page 54). More real textbook explanations should be attached to every topic. The answers on page 90 refer to an exercise on page 34 which is not the same.There is NO treatment at allof the ""Circle of Fifths"", a very important core concept in music theory. Many of the written exercisesare very good to think through . I would not recommend this book but to only beginning students."
3,"Sort of battered, but usable","Looks like it had been used a lot, covers are dirty and the whole thing feels kind of grimy, but it's usable so WHATEVER"
5,fantastic contemporary Brazil music: a bright sunny day,"A great female vocalist sings mostly original songs. The bouncy accompaniment is heavy on electronics with some live instruments. It's meant for dancing, but I don't go clubbing and still thoroughly enjoy listening to it. The whole CD has the feel of a bright and sunny day, very uplifting. I don't speak Portuguese so can't comment on the lyrics. No ballads, not classic bossa or MPB, just catchy upbeat melodies that make you want to hum and smile. If you like other Brazilian contemporary female singers backed primarily by electronica and cheerfully geared for dancing, you'll love this CD. I'm thinking of Bebel, Zuco 103, Wagon Cookin, Rosalia, Shrift, and groups/singers like this.By the way, Amazon lists 2 CDs by this group, but they have the same track list - one is just an import, one domestic US."
5,Evocative,This book is a gem. I lived in Japan in the late 1980's and so I have read many books written by ex-pats. This book is not only one of the finest in the gaijin-written genre - but it is one of the best pieces of fiction I have read in quite some time.
3,Read it for the scenery,"Toshi Okamato is attracted to Western women, all because of a childhood vision of Audrey Hepburn in a film. Brown's novel hangs on this slender---very slender--- premise, but in fact the most interesting aspects of the novel have less to do with Toshi than with his surroundings. His childhood home on Hokkaido, along with the mystery of his parents' marriage, is beautifully evoked, and the scenes set in contemporary Tokyo are also nicely observed. The novel shifts back and forth between past and present, between the spare rural noodle shop run by Toshi's father and the hustle of the city. The cause of Toshi's infatuation with Western women is sketched but never really explained; the same is true of his friendship with Paul, a gay man. Enjoy this novel not for its plot or characterizations, which aren't particularly memorable, but for its impressionistic evocation of Hokkaido."
1,Yawn....,"Why is it that with the growing number of '1st novels' written by people who've spent time in Japan, none can seem to do it without over-generalizations about the Japanese, or at least presenting a balanced view? I'm beginning to think that they are selling books as part of their therapy.AHN is an easy read, but not that enjoyable to be honest. All the negative stereotypes were present.(Although to be honest, I've never met a crazy female English teacher here in Tokyo....so far they've all been male)It was interesting reading about the surroundings and being able to picture them as they really are, but in all, the book was a disappointment."
1,A book of stereotypes and junior high school writing style,"Audrey Hepburn's Neck is the only book I have actually thrown in the garbage after reading it. The characters in the book are so one-dimensional that there is nothing they say or do that is the least bit interesting. The thread-bare plot reminds me of something I would read in a junior high creative writing class. Brown's use of metaphor and simile were so trite that instead of painting a picture of Japan in my mind, it painted nothing more than a stereotyped portrait of a country that is much richer than can be seen in this book."
1,Don't buy this book,"This book is outright boring. Also, all the Japanese characters are based on stereotypes. Brown's sentiment toward Japanese-American relations dates back to World War II. This book isn't worth your time"
2,"Tedious, cliched, smug....","Have to agree with others who found this book condescending. It seems that Alan Brown had lots of ideas for a book about Japan but as none of them was worthy of a novel, he threw them all in together, with a few observations that he thought rather clever and then made up lots of other things that were too ridiculous even for Japan. ""Look, I went to Japan and found or imagined these things"". By using real events such as the death of the Emperor, he implies that other topical events in the book also really occurred- for those of you who weren't in Japan in the late 80's, take this book with a pinch of salt! The mother's story turned out to be the most interesting part of the book, but it was a bit late by then and she had been such a sketchy character that it was hard to get involved at that stage. If you're really interested in Japan, try Alan Booth or Banana Yoshimoto..or anyone... Let this be a lesson to us old Japan hands who think we've got a great novel inside us!"
4,Sentences as beautiful as Audrey Hepburn's neck.,"Depressing as it is to agree with the Kirkus Review, I do. This is an elegant take on an uncomplicated, emotional story. A young man learns to forgive his parents their frailities and, in the process, understands his attraction to white chicks. A gutsy move for the author, since according to the jacket photo, he himself is a white guy, choosing to write from the point-of-view of a young Japanese artist with a troubled family history. Nonetheless, Alan Brown uses humor and beautiful descriptive sentences to make it work. Does he stereotype the Japanese? I think a more important question is: Do we care about Toshi or do we put the book down? I did... and I didn't. Plus, the ""Epilogue"" is perfect. (But then, I'm white and own my own copy of ""Breakfast at Tiffanys"".)"
4,A Surprisingly Good Book,"I like it when a book surprises me. I like it better when a book turns out to be surprisingly good. ""Audrey Hepburn's Neck"" certainly accomplishes both.Toshi is the main character who grows up in rural Japan then moves to Tokyo where he dates American women and thus learns about the big city and about American women - particularly the cultural differences between Japanese and Americans. At first, author Alan Brown illustrates this in an elegant, entertaining and almost whimsical manner. But what starts as something seemingly superficial turns much deeper as Toshi discovers much more about himself and what it means to be truly Japanese.""Audrey Hepburn's Neck"" is a quick, enjoyable read that will ""surprise"" you with its powerful and intelligent theme."
3,Best for Commentary on WWII Activites,"The book ""gets good"" near the end when it reveals the basis of his parents strained relationship. The running commentary on his interactions with friends and his search for meaning in his work are entertaining (sparked with humor and insight). I do not understand the fascination with Hepburn's neck or the implied rejection of Japanese women."
3,A case study of the pathology of weirdness,"So many of us live in a veritable cocktail party of unspoken experiences, constantly bumping into something we should know but only sense exists and hoping to God that the lubrication of alcohol will get us beyond the awkward bits. Most of AHN was that awkward, but what child confronts a parent demanding explanation of the family weirdness, what sex buddy demands an explanation of their partner's obsessions and what friend has the courage to criticize a friend's choices? AHN is no masterpiece, but I did like the goofiness of Emperor wife try-outs and the urgency of the characters' struggle to ""connect"""
4,I thought it was grand,"Gee, it seems some of these reviews are a bit harsh. I liked this book. It was a good read and that is a great thing these days."
3,"interesting, but not satisfying","The author presents an interesting view of Japanese culture and American influence. There was a lot going on, and I thought the story with Jane was unnecessary. More time could have been spent on Toshi's family, or even on how Toshi felt about what was happening in his life. Toshi remained a blank slate, and I never did understand his motivation for some of his actions. It's a quick easy read, and I didn't find it dull, just not satisfying. I didn't find the writing to be incredibly adept; it was competent for telling the story."
3,Ok Blower/Vac for the money,"This TrimmerPlus add on works ok for the money, but I can't recomend it for anyone with more than an 8th of an acre. I have a 1/4 acre yard and this blower was a bit underpowed, and not much faster than raking. In Vacum mode it works ok, but again is kinda slow and the bag fills up way too fast. I've been thinking of modifying the exhaust to feed straight into a 25 gal trash can. All in all a good idea, but not made for big yards."
3,Hard to manuver,"too bulky. blower strength depends on the trimmer motor. If motor loses it's power, then there goes your blower too."
3,"Good Desk reference, not-so-good training manual","This book gives great tips and shortcuts and good memory joggers for those who are already experienced with Dreamweaver MX 2004. While it doesn't highlight the differences in MX and MX 2004, the reader can easily extract the new, improved stuff.If you've never touched Dreamweaver and need more explicit training, stick with the TRAINING FROM THE SOURCE manual, DreamweaverMX 2004 by Khristine Annwn Page."
5,Seiko Watch Review,"I've had Seiko watches for years and I just keep coming back to them. This one has just the right amount of ""bling"" and looks like a Rolex. At 1/2 the price of a retail store, I couldn't pass it up."
1,This is NOT Badfinger!,This is certainly not Badfinger. Joey Molland gives versions of the hits and a few of his own Badfinger songs. None of these versions come anywhere near the originals in quality. It's really hard to say much positive about these recordings.Buy the original albums instead!!
1,God-awful,the other reviewers are quite correct. this cd is the worst quality cd i've ever heard. what was joey molland thinking of (other than a few quick bucks....)? what a shame!
1,best of badfinger1994:featuring joey molland,"1 star is overrated! sorry joey,youve got a few good songs but please don't try to sing stuff that ham and/or evans sang.i love badfinger but don't scare of any new coming fans.get the real stuff and don't waste 5 bucks."
1,Pete and Tommy are spinning in their graves!,"Oh Joey! You crossed the line of decency on this project. Six of the 10 tracks are Ham/Evans compositions, 2 are ""JC Mollard"" (must be Joey, huh) pieces. Recorded with session musicians, this CD has managed to strip every breath of emotion and depth from these great pieces of rock music. The songs have been sanitized and nuetralized, totally lacking any of the feelings of the original compositions. My strongest reaction was intense yearning to hear the heart and soul that went into the originals, or even the dynamic drive that is in the original groups live takes. Sorry, Joey, I can't stand behind you on this one."
1,Badfinger - the Worst Best of,"The album ""Badfinger The Best of"" is a poor attempt by Joey Molland to recreate the sound of a great band with different personnel. The is the 10 cut album beginning with ""Come and Get It"" and ending with ""Midnight Caller"". Recorded in 1994, supposedly ""digitally"", it is the worst example of engineering I have ever come across. The sound is flat, with no depth or vibrancy at all; it sounds like a hasty mono recording of an old stereo LP (at least the digital technique left it with no hiss, pop, or scratches). In addition, the recorded volume level is terrible; I have to turn my car stereo up to 25 to get the same level I get from most other CDs at 16 or 17.The music and vocals are a cheap imitation of the original; the melody and the words are the same, but that's about it. If you like Badfinger, you won't like this album. Spend your money on one of the originals."
1,shame on Joey Molland,a cheap and sad attempt by Joey Molland to wring a few bucks out of his illustrious past. These are not the original recordings but remakes with a truly insipid drum machine backing and awful production. THIS IS NOT A BADFINGER RECORDING!
1,Shock and Awe-ful,"Not knowing the ruse behind this CD, after hearing the initial first two (2) bars of this disc, I knew that contrary to what the cover says, this was NOT Badfinger. Each track sounded like a weak cover of Badfinger, performed by my 8th grade garage band. By the 4th track, my head began to pound, due to the tremendously way over-mic'd snare/drum kit that horribly dominates and smears each 'would-be' track. But even if George Martin mixed this CD, the entire effort would still come off as a bad jam session. The mix job and production was pure ameteur hour. How this CD ever saw the light of day is an enigma which will go down in music history."
2,Joey lost my respect with this egotistical remake.,"Joey Molland has been the caretaker of the Badfinger legacy. He went off the tracks when he decided to reproduce, dub, and remaster these songs on this one. My first impression was that he was so egotistical using his voice in place of Mike, Pete, and Tom's. Almost like they never existed."
2,This Isn't Badfinger,Stupidly I bought this CD without reading the reviews. Unfortunately Amazon does not indicate that these are not the original tracks - rather a recording done by (who knows?) in 1994. Not worth buying.
1,YIKES!!!,"what on earth did I just listen to? It certainly WASN'T Badfinger! I am extremely disapointed. If you're looking for the radio hits you remember, they're all there, just not in any way CLOSE to resembling anything worth listening to. this is a badly recorded and mixed version, and the singer cant even stay in key. I'm going to swan dive out my window now. Is that clear enough?"
2,Who mixed this!?,"I really looked forward to this CD. But the ""mix master"" on this one should have his hearing examined. The overlays on ""significant"" guitar fills are out of proportion to the the rest of the mix. The equalization was horrible. Check out No Dice instead... it's original"
3,Not All Bad,"I personally don't care if this is the original Badfinger or not. I saw Joey Molland live this year (2007) and loved it. What's wrong with him performing solo versions of his old band's songs? I say nothing, because a lot of bands do that. So to say that Joey Molland shouldn't tour with Badfinger music, does that mean that:Stu Cook and Doug Clifford shouldn't tour with original CCR music?Ray Manzarek and Robby Krieger shouldn't play Doors music on stage?Mike Love and Bruce Johnston shouldn't tour as The Beach Boys?I say they're all legit. And I have seen all three of the above mentioned acts in concert, and I don't care what anyone says. They are great. Why doesn't Joey Molland deserve an equal voice? No it's not the same. But I think it can be different and still be good.Maybe some fans are reluctant to accept line-up changes. After all, there are some Who fans who say their career should've ended when Moon died. WRONG!!!"
1,Not Badfinger,The words `corporate rock sucks' come to mind. I was amazed at how bland these guys were! They sound like they're about to fall asleep any second. Thank God the seventies are gone! D
5,The Best,"I am lactose intolerant.I had tried using Lactaid, but it helped me very little.This supplement makes it possible for me to eat a moderate amount of dairy with few consequences."
5,The finest book on healing for those who need help.,"God used this very book to give me the faith I needed to see God HEAL ME. This man, through prayer and faith alone, saw God do mighty miracles of healing, sanctification, and revival. This is for our lives today - its not gone !! If you are suffering, please read this book and give God a chance to heal you. Mr. Bevington writes, ""Look up, weary one; Jesus is the same today as when He walked the Judean hills and healed many there. He wants to heal you, to get a chance to heal you"". I am living proof that He can and will. 3/16/06."
5,Remarkable Miracles,"G.Bevington was highly effective in prayer. I wish he had written an autobiography,in addition to more detail on how he spoke ( prayed) to God in his prayers. Also a little more explanation on the phases that he seemed to move through. I wish I could have met him! What a Saint!!Bevington's results with the use of prayer was consistently successful. The book inspires one to pray more persistently and continue until an answer occurs. He prayed and fasted with powerful results!!This is an important book for those interested in improving their prayer life.I have forwarded the book on and will continue to do so with another copy."
3,Almost as hard as shoveling by hand.,Does not perform as well as expected. Heavy to handle with no skids or wheels to make sure it doesn't dig in deeper than it should. Awkward trying to balance this machine along with directing snow removal.
5,great relaxig music with a kick,i have already purchased this cd and i listen to it in the car and on my home sterio all the time. i find the music relaxing but it has some bass that gives it a kick i cant wait for the next album to come out. thanks bj for the great tunes. alisha
4,"Love it, but hard to clean","My dog, who love-love-loves pillows, adores this bed. The poly fill is a bit uneven and unfortunately the cover isn't removeable so it's a little difficult to clean. However, it's generously stuffed and very warm, and my smallish lab-pit mix fits into the 32-inch just fine. Medium-large dogs should probably opt for the larger size though."
3,Scotch-Brite Heavy Duty Commercial Scouring Pad,These are very useful products but I find them much lighter than the originals we just ran out of. I'd say about 1/3 lighter. Not as abrasive either since I have to go over the kitchen sink quite a bit more than the older ones. (That may be a good thing but I'd rather have the older product back (got that at Costco).We usually cut them in half because they are more useful in that size for normal tasks. If I was cleaning large areas then they would be better.
5,A Must Have...,"The Official Samba-3 HOWTO and Reference Guide is a ""Must Have"" book for anyone responsible for the running of a multi platform environment. Written for both the SAMBA beginner and pro alike, this book allow the reader to both learn the basics or go as deep as the source code of the SAMBA tools."
2,Sadly disappointed,"Anxious to set up samba at home I headed down to the local bookstore and picked up this book at full price (perhaps the only samba 3 book there). I think I read about 1/4 of the book and have now decided it will be going back tomorrow. It's easy to read if you have some Windows and some Linux/UNIX experience, but every chapter is plagued with sentences an 8th grade student failing English could have pointed to problems! Sometimes it was difficult to determine what the meaning of some statements should be. In one chapter a discussion of non-encrypted passwords repeated advantages from the discussion of encrypted passwords, advantages that clearly do not exist!It feels likes the HOWTOs from the Internet were simply copied, so why wasn't there time to edit?"
5,Exactly what it says it is.,"I'm just glad they still carry this for such an old coffeemaker. And I really appreciate that they don't send another lid, because 99 times out of 100, you've just broken the glass part, and it would be a waste to throw the lid away, too."
1,Really cheap,"I ordered this scale because it ""looked"" exactly like the one that just fell on the floor and broke to pieces. It arrived on time, but the needle was broken off the face of the scale. Sent it back, and the 2nd arrived, also broken, but this time, it was the knob that adjusts the weight. It would not adjust to zero. Very sadly I sent that one back too and oerdered a completely different scale!"
5,Hard to find in the stores.,"Kitchen scales are a common little appliance in the UK. Not so easy to find here in the USA. I have a little recipe book from 30 years ago and you must go by oz., lbs, etc. So, I had bought and brought a little one with me from Scotland. Long since lost through moves and such. This one is bigger. I haven't actually used it yet, but it looks great. The price was reasonable too."
4,I ball,This is one of the mixtape i personally liked. Because I'm part of the experience itself. Not bragging or something but I hang out with them when they played here in Manila. This dvd really completed my experience.
2,amp leaves much to desire / Customer service nightmare,"This A/V receiver arrived with a remote control that does not work. The auto set-up works OK but it thought I had large front speakers when there small, so it configure the sub-woofer too light. When playing DVDs with my new OPPO up-converting DVD player it would loose the center channel. I would have to go into set-up to get the center channel back, (bear in mind all of this with no working remote). When trying to get the remote replaced under warranty you can forget about being able to speak to customer service by phone, you will be on hold permanently. When you get someone to respond to an email you can understand why they dont answer there phone as english is likely not there primary language. The person I dealt with was clueless and unprofessional. I don't need this kind of aggravation after spending all the money for a good receiver. This ones going back, and I will never buy Denon again"
3,AVR-887 7.1,"Working with DENON products like usual with setup was great, the problem was the HDMI connection are very picky and if a flea so much as farts you can loose contact between the cable connector and receiver jack. Had to use multiple brands of HDMI cable only one brand fit a little better than all others."
4,Put the kettle on,"Bake a batch of scones and settle down to a lovely world, a small English village school as seen through the eyes of Miss Read, a teacher.These are my run-for-cover books. When the world is too much with me, I find my copy of Village School or Village Diary, wrap up in a quilt, and fall under the spell of these gentle novels."
5,Another home besides Mitford!,"I loved this book and do believe I have found another home when Mitford ends! I loved the characters and although simple, I can't wait to devour the next one!"
1,typos every page - awful,Love the book but the typos on every single page are just awful. Downright distracting and should never happen when you pay for a book on Kindle. The book should be perfect. None of the Kindle Miss Read books are free of constant typo errors.
2,Fairacre Series - Village School,"I'm a 'fan' of Miss Read so I enjoy this type of writing and I enjoyed this book as well as several others in the Miss Read series.What I found very annoying in this book and others in the series is the many miss-spelled words, and I'm not talking aboutone occasionally, there are MANY. These are not inexpensive e-books - they cost $8.00 - $9.00 each. VERY bothersome!We expect better!"
1,Contains Racist Stereotypes,"Miss Read's books often contain offensive racist stereotypes and racist language. They definitely don't age well, and while the stories are interesting, I personally couldn't get past the (many) parts that offended me."
2,fun but difficult,"My boys have really enjoyed playing with this toy, however in order to lower the bucket it requires a lot of wrist strength and most of 2-4 year olds that have tried to play with it are not able to make it function on their own. It's even a little difficult for me to get it to lower. The only other comment I would add regarding this excavator is that if the children are not able to operate the arm that makes the bucket lower they tend to lean forward on the toy, causing the toy to tip and occassionally the child will fall face forward into the arm of the excavator. This toy requires a lot of parental supervision."
2,It is plastic!,"I was expecting a little more durability from this toy. While it has not broken yet, I expect it to by the end of summer. Everything on this toy is plastic even the so called mechanics. However with this being said, my two year old son does enjoy playing on it. I just question how long he will get to play on it before it breaks."
3,nice jacket but too short,"as in title, this quality jacket but it's too short for 3XLI guess that 3 inchech would make it a true size."
5,A great new Fado voice,"I thought Amalia was all there was to Fado until I heard Mafalda.A sensitive, dramatic and penetrating voice. A must for Fado fans."
5,Something for warm summer nights,I just spent a couple of hours at the Castello in Lisbon when I heard this music. This was an immediate must buy. Now back in California I enjoy this touch of mediterranean feeling.
5,The Hottest Logic Book Ever!!!,"I was fortunate enough to not only learn from this clear, concise, excellent text, but to take the course with Dr. Carter himself. Just recently a friend saw it on my bookshelf and exclaimed, ""OH, we used this in my deductive logic class at Harvard; it was so much more student-friendly than Copi's."" Dr. Carter is a great writer, logician, and teacher. Due to these factors, this book can be used independently, or as part of a class, to learn the art of logic."
5,Book,ASIN:0385034733 Elements of Weaving: A Complete Introduction to the Art and Techniques]]This book was in very good condition and it arrived in a timely manner.[[
4,easily teachable,"I use this book of poetry in a creative writing class for high school students. While the language can be sometimes tough for them to follow (they're almost always afraid of poetry), the rhythms are so easy for them to follow. You may find yourself tapping your feet to the poems. This is a poet who knows sound, who knows rhythm, who knows the ways to marry those two ideas to words. And he teaches my students to do the same."
3,Learned more about Ryle's theology than Whitefield's,"The picture given of the preacher is filled with more opinionated commentary than concretes. Though I share Ryle's feelings, I felt cheated because there was too little detail given to support his thoughts, let alone to allow me to independently form my own opinion. Using more description of accounts from the man's life could have painted the same picture more vividly without requiring a longer volume.The plea to stick by the Church of England at the end seems ironic. The lukewarmness of the church in his own century masked many of the same ills that were apparent in the prior one. I hardly think George Whitefield's energetic method would have been tolerated any better in Ryle's time."
5,Very pleased,I am very pleased with the Warner bras. I have worn Warner bras for many years and was distressed not to find them in the Department stores where I shop. But I did find them on line which was terrific!
3,Good for Green but not his best,"I've listen to this album many, many times but no tracks really stand out like his other work. It's not a bad album but I would recommend Call Me, Let's Stay Togeather or Still in Love With yu first"
2,Did not taste good at all,This product does not have a good taste at all. It did not mix well either as it claims to do
1,Looking for Healthy snack alternatives,"I got thinkGreen Bars of this one (Peanut Butter Chocolate) and the Cranberry Apple and the Blueberry Noni. The Blueberry and Cranberry Apple were REALLY good, but the Peanut Butter Chocolate not so much. The taste seemed bitter, and it might be from one of the ingredients being a liquer, I don't know. I would DEFINITELY try the other flavors they have in the thinkGreen and thinkOrganic Bars, though."
5,An excellent period story,"I very much enjoyed this story and the time in which it is set. From the-edge-of-WWII to the free-thinking 60's, this book gave me a taste of American life as if I had really been there and as if the characters had been real -and my friends. I enjoyed the relationships between the characters and the turbulent times in which they lived. Also, the almost unbelievable amount of changes the world went through. Very realistic. A t.v. miniseries was made starring Bruce Boxlietner, Perry King, Deborah Raffin, Edward Albert, John Shea, and Sharon Gless. It was quite true to the novel, and both I and others that I know who had read the book were pleased with the results. Since the book appears to be out of print, maybe we at least can watch the movie again someday. I can dream, can't I?"
3,A Disappointment,"After reading so many wonderful reviews, I was very disappointed by The Last Convertible. Although some of it was well written and the story was interesting at times, it was cliche filled and often trite. Most of the characters were stock types who behaved in predictable ways. Hardly a compelling novel!"
1,Water Soaked,"This great old book was accordioned due to moisture. I could read it, but it was a poor bargain."
4,Insight Into a Precious Generation,"I read the RD Condensed version, which itself seemed long, but quite rewarding. I would have finished the full text too. It's a fine and sweeping story with a few faults that can be overlooked, or perhaps are functional devices. The real value for me was the insight it gave into my parents' generation. Myrer lived the part, and makes a heartfelt revelation of a lot more about the makeup of the young WWII generation than they had a tendency to reveal about themselves. Perhaps the most naive, innocent and assimilated young generation the country ever had, thrust through the most extreme and rapid changes any generation has seen, including my own of the '60's. He does a pretty good job of making you experience it, and this gives me a bit more appreciation for the generation that raised me."
5,My first great novel,"I read this while in college almost 30 years ago and still recommend it to people from my list of ""best books of my life."" Myrer is incredible and ""Once an Eagle' should be also considered. One of the greatest books in American Literature!"
5,"Oh, the lost romance of it all...","Wonderful, wonderful book. I read it during my early teen years, in soft cover. Then I bought a hard cover, left that in another country. Have bought several soft covers over the years in second hand stores. Have re-read it so many times, because I can identify with the characters in this book - anybody should be able to. There's so much of romance and hopes and dreams and the lives of an era - that translates into any era...This is a mirror of life in general, of youth and age and everything in between.It brings out in me an emotion of the hopeless romances of life.I would recommend this book to anybody."
5,King Ranch primer,"Without it, an outsider cannot begin to appreciate or understand the King Ranch. I read both volumes in days."
4,book,this a good set of two books to own if you are a collector of King Ranch. They should only go up.
3,Amon Duul - 'Disaster' (Spalax),"Originally released in 1971 on the BASF label, 'Disaster' came from the same 'legendary' 1968 studio sessions that a couple of other Amon Duul reissues had. Total of eleven tracks here. Three of those run over the nine minute mark,the jamming ""Drum Things"",""Somnium (Trauma)"" and ""Frequency"", in which I thought were the best cuts that 'Disaster' had to offer. Okay krautrock release, in general. This title is mainly aimed toward the AD / AD II completists."
5,Excellent as always!,"Marty is great as usual and this is mostly newer offerings. I was a little confused by the description that this was a complete CD as opposed to just 2-3 songs. It is a full CD. Marty as usual brings his rich piano melodies along with his exquisite voice to these songs.If you enjoy Marty's music you will be very pleased. If you have never heard him before, Marty is one of the premiere Messianic performers in the world. His music will immediately take you into worship."
3,gift trimmer,I ordered this for my son in law. He does a lot of yard work in his neighborhood. I wish I new more to tell you but he seemed pleased when he opened the box.
3,"Easy to use, marginally efficient","My favorite quality of the blower is that is the lightest TrimmerPlus Add-on that I own. This isn't a substitute for a dedicated leaf blower, and the accessory nozzles work loose after a few minutes. But it's fun to watch them blow away! It works fine on sidewalks and curbs, and I've used it for drying the car. But towels are lighter...."
4,Great for light duty work...,"Pros: I use this primarily for blowing grass clippings off my driveway and sidewalk. It is absolutely perfect for jobs like these. It is also much more cost effective than buying a separate machine for these tasks. Fit easily on my Toro weed trimmer.I haven't had to do any heavy work, but I would imagine it lacks a lot of the power necessary to move a large pile of leaves. Just a guess though, since I don't have to! ;)Cons: The plastic attachment on the end doesn't stay on very well. If you hit the side walk enough, it'll pop off. I just have to be careful not to bump it too much. Only slightly annoying. And finally, it has a high pitched whirling sound, which caught me off guard; but once again, only slightly annoying. My neighbors may find it more so."
3,vent shades,"the front shades are good and will last a while I think. However, the rear shades are already coming off. The design and angle of the rear shades just don't stick very well with the small amount of glue paper on them."
2,The book is not what the title implies,"I got this book to read a good account of the pros and cons of socialism. Instead, I found a book dedicated almost entirely to describing the attributes of socialism and giving the bases for believing in it."
2,Not the same size it claims to be!!,"I ordered this product online, because the measurements seemed perfect for the small space I have. However, after putting it together, it is not at all the size it claims to be. The actual size is 38H x 20D x 36w. Not 39 1/2H x 16 3/4D x 22 1/4W!!! I was extremely dissapointed in the false advertising!"
3,"Interesting but unfortunately, too pretentious","This is a very good book to learn more about the new theories concerning the origin and shape of our Universe. Everybody agrees that Mr. Hawking definitively has something to say about this topic. The problem is that his style is frankly so, so pretentious that it's a little bit disturbing (you will see a lot of ""but of course I knew"", or ""Once again, it was me who...""). If you put together this and the fact that understanding these new theories is something far from being easy, you will find this book not so pleasant as you could expect a priori."
5,it works! lol,"this review is simple.It works! Use it for my LG Voyager, and it's great.Nice silver color to look at, as opposed to the black charger that LG provides."
5,It's a flag,"It's just what it looks like -- a flag. We use it to teach about diver down rules. At a great price, it works great."
2,Scuba Dan,I was disappointed in this product. I bought it to use as a down flag on my dive boat. The first time I used it it was frayed and faded at the end of the day. Payed a lot for what I was hoping was quality...
5,"large, high quality","bigger then expected. seems very durable. Still need 14 more words....would look great on a boat, way too large to carry on float while diving/ snorkeling"
3,Bad audio for TiVo download,"These Top Gear episodes have a bad audio mix, when they're downloaded to a TiVo. The left channel is almost completely absent, and the mix is in mono. As a previous poster noted, this incorrect mix makes the voice track is very hard to hear in parts, and just sounds poor. Disappointing."
4,bad sound quality,top gear is great as usual but the sound in this video seems off. it gets really hard to hear them talking over music that is supposed to be in the background. it almost sounds like 5 channel sound was mixed incorrectly... this was the first video we tried from amazon and i am pretty disappointed with it.
3,A great season but no Senna tribute!,"Top Gear is a terrific television series, and Season 15 does not disappoint -- except that the publisher forgot to include the Ayrton Senna tribute from Episode 5. This was the #1 reason why I purchased the season in the first place, as it is a stirring tribute to the greatest F1 driver of all time. To leave it off of the disc was an egregious error."
3,BEWARE!!! ~12 tailing minutes missing from the full episode!!!,"Don't get me wrong. I absolutely LOVE Top Gear UK (sorry Top Gear US, but you suck!).I've watched all seasons, episodes and specials and I'm really a bug fan. That's why I easily give all 5 stars to the show but only 3 in this review.I bought this particular episode because is should contain a ~12 min. tribute to famous Brazilian F-1 driver Ayrton Senna for what would have been his 50th b-day. For my entire surprise, exactly this portion has been cut out in this version from Amazon.com.WHAT A SHAME AMAZON!!!! You should AT LEAST make that ""detail"" very clear to your customers.It's too bad that we still can't ""return"" a digital purchase. If I could, I would certainly have returned it. And this is not my first deception with this kind of purchase."
1,"Skip the DVD, go for the Blu-Ray","There is one enormous reason NOT to buy the DVD pack of Series 15. Unlike the high definition Blu-Ray release, the DVDs only feature the cut down, broadcast-length versions of this series 6 episodes.There is very little in the way of extra material. A prime example is from Episode 5; Jeremy made an excellent film commemorating Aryton Senna's 50th birthday that originally aired in the extended, 80-minute form for US television. You can't view this scene on the DVD, it's completely removed (instead you get 18 minutes of Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz and shameful plugging).Audio and visual quality is up to par for DVD, but it's disappointing that these two versions are not identical. Will definitely order the Blu-Ray to replace this inferior copy."
3,INTERESTING VIDEO,IF YOU LIKE THE SHOW YOU WILL LOVE THE DVD COLLECTION FILLED IWTH EVERYTHING FROMT HE SHOWS WITHOUT PESKY COMMERCIALS
4,"Awesome show, meh on 'owning'","I love the Top Gear Show, it's absolutely the best in my opinion. The price was great to see the whole season, at the same time I was disappointed that my 'ownership' of the files does not allow me to actually have digital copies on my mac- I can just watch them on amazon is all. Meh."
1,Flimsy Packaging of DVD.,"The packaging for the DVD was not glued or incased, it is flimsy, not like a professional DVD. At least for the cost it should be presented in a attractive manner. The quality of the DVD is fine. But as it was a Valentine's Day gift for my boyfriend, I was quite disappointed in the packaging of the label with the credits and photo of the film, is just there falling off.Thank you, Eve Holmes"
1,Beware the German version,"What they don't tell you about the German version: it's only in German! Yes, I was dumb enough to buy this non-subtitled version."
5,I wish they had more Louis de Funes DVDs,"I just watched the movie on DVD last night and was reminded once again why Louis de Funes was my favorite actor growing up even though I don't even speak French. I've seen plenty of his comedies, and some of his best are part of the Gendarme-series, where he plays a cop who encounters human-looking Extraterrestrials at one point. He has to throw water on them to make them rust.The DVD image is of great quality even though you may not have heard of the releasing studio before. As far as the plot, if you like screwball comedies, this is one of the best available."
2,I expected more.,I expected more practical advice and less biography. The title implied practical advice whereas the content was more a story of a personal experience.
2,Wasn't What I Expected,I thought this book was going to give review of several medical scenarios and applications. I didn't feel the title represented the content of the book and was greatly disappointed.
3,Helpful,Liked some of the points. Really not big on giving wordy reviews. So I have said all I need to.
4,Excellent Book,"If you're NOT medically trained, you NEED this book. Perhaps even more important than knowing how to treat minor wounds and ailments is knowing when you're ""in over your head"". As an e-book, you can even keep it on your cell phone to read just about anywhere. I highly recommend this one."
3,Pretty radical,This is a free download and I have found this to be a really abstract view. I take some of it with a grain of salt. Still an interesting read and got my attention. Thanks Amazon!
1,Holistic lies,This has nothing to do with being a doctor. It is not real medical advice. It is holistic healing which has been shown in many double blind tests to be completely ineffective.
5,Be your own doctor,Great read. Gives the reader a better understanding of the human body and what makes us tick. I recommend this book.
5,Drawing from twenty-five years of photographic efforts,"Bill Henson is an Australian artist with a well-earned reputation as a passionate and visionary photographer. His images explore the twilight zones separating day and night, nature and civilization, youth and adulthood, male and female. His use of light and composition transform photography into a genuine art form while providing the viewer with insights and memorable impressions beyond the boundaries of static rationalism. Drawing from twenty-five years of photographic efforts, Lux Et Nox showcases the best of this master photographer's work to date. Lux et Nox is very highly recommended for students of photography and an invaluable addition to professional and academic Photography collections."
5,The title says it all,This is a lovely collection of all of Bob Seger's best hits. It brings them all together on one disk. Great party music.
5,buena compilacion..aunque sabe a poco.....,"gran coleccion de canciones...ya se...faltan algunos temas..sobran algunos, pero pienso que es una obra muy recomendable sobretodo para los que se arriman por primera vez al trabajo de este sencillo pero interesante artista..."
4,"Where is ""Shakedown"" ???","Dlaczego nie ma ""Shakedown""? Przeciez to byl jego jedyny numer 1 w USA na liscie Hot 100 Billboard'u :-("
3,Missing too many great songs,"I agree with previous reviewers who say there are far too many great songs missing--Fire Lake, Shame on the moon just to name two missing songs. However, there are still great tracks, including one of my personal favorites ""Main Street."" I never much cared for the hard rockers Seger has recorded, preferring the more introspective, quieter songs. but this is a good introduction to Seger's work. If you want the real picture buy his first two albums."
3,Is this really Bob's best???,"This is a fairly good compilation of his early hits, but what the heck happened to ""Even Now""? For me personally, that song is the best by Bob Seger. It's interesting that it does not appear on his Greatest Hits, Part II either."
3,Pretty Good,Bob Seger has had some Good Songs.We've Got tonight is a Good Song.You'll Accompany Me is a Great track.But Many Of The Songs are Middle Of The Road.It's Pretty Good But You feel he could&Should Be doing More.
2,Not thorough by any means,"Artists of this magnitude, Springsteen, Seger, and Petty have extensive bodies of work. Logically, their greatest hits compilations should be given 2 discs for starters. But that's not the case.Bob Seger's greatest hits is missing out on so much great stuff, it's almost doing him a disservice. The track sequencing is not in Chronological order, so you get the bizarre effect of bouncing from 1976's ""Mainstreet"" to fifteen years later, 1991's ""The fire inside"".Lesser numbers like ""You'll accomp'ny me"" should have been left off.There's the glaring absence of classic rock staples ""Beautiful loser"", ""Katmandu"", and ""Rock and roll never forgets"", in addition to strong album cuts like ""Shame on the moon"", ""Fire lake"", and ""Betty Lou"". Also missing in action is his BIGGEST, and only number 1 hit ""Shakedown"".If you're new to Bob Seger, this isn't the place to start, I'd recommend acquiring Night Moves instead."
2,"""Greatest Hits"" strikes out as both introduction and summary","With so many CDs to buy and limited resources, I held off replacing my Bob Seger records, except for Night Moves. I knew someday he would cave in to the temptation of easy $$$ and issue a collection. With all of his great material and superb band, a double CD or box set would be the best way to document his career, a la Clapton's Crossroads collection. Right?Normally a collection from such a prominent artist will show the listener why his fame and reputation is deserved. Not here. This CD sells Mr. Seger so far short that it should be avoided at all costs. Try either of the live albums or Night Moves to get a true reading on the power of his songwriting and superlative band. ""Travelin' Man/Beautiful Loser"" from Live Bullet is an example of superior songwriting, singing, and playing. There's scarcely a hint of this power on the Greatest Hits collection."
2,there's alot missing.....,"Fans of Seger have been waiting a long time for this. But this just doesn't cut it. the weird part is Seger himself put this together. there's at least another disc worth of material that was ignored here. for casual fans this will do, but for a true career span, buy the individual albums.where's ""Ramblin' Gamblin"" Man, ""Even Now"", ""Brave Strangers"", ""Travelin' Man/Beautiful Loser"" or ""Shame on the Moon""? lots of holes here."
1,"Bob Seger new cd ""TRAIN MAN""","If we could have given a 0 star we would have. I have been a Bob Seger fan since Day 1. This CD is an embarassment to Bob Seger and a major disappointment to his many fans. This is not only bad, but is AWFUL! Bob Seger needs to listen to ""Old Time Rock N Roll"" and then be locked in a closet for 24 hours and forced to listen to Train Man as punishment for betraying his fans."
2,"Great songs yes, but poor remaster/CD quality",I was very disappointed with the poor quality of this CD. I have a $10k stereo system that brings out the best in most music. But the recordings on this CD were sharp and harsh and muddy. My old cassette sounded better I think.
5,This is such a great album,"There is not one bad song on this album. It is so great. I give it 3 thumbs up and 6 stars. ""Night Moves"" is great. I didn't know that ""Turn the Page"" and ""Still the Same"" were his songs. It is probably the best greatest hits album in the history of Rock and Roll."
2,"The songs are good, it's just not complete.","The ones picked here also tend to be on the softer side. Seger is a great rock 'n' roller, but you wouldn't know it from this collection. ""Rock 'n' Roll Never Forgets"" is a particularly glaring omission. If you're a fan of his softer music, this is for you."
5,Bob Seger - Greatest Hits,I can't believe this CD was not in my collection years ago. This is one of the best greatest hits collections I own.
1,Rock and Roll NEVER Forgets?,"Well, this lame compilation does. I can't believe that Capitol Records would call this Bob's ""Greatest Hits"". It is like the record company has the rest of his hits on a two- or maybe even three-disc set somewhere in a vault, keeping this ""Greatest Hits"" disc as highlights. Sure, ""Turn the Page"", ""You'll Accompn'y Me"" ""Like a Rock"", and ""Old Time Rock and Roll"" are good hits to have on the disc, but what about ""Nine Tonight"", ""Get Out of Denver"", ""Katmandu"", Rock and Roll Never Forgets"", ""Shame On The Moon"", American Storm"", and even his top ten SMASH, ""Shakedown""? Who picked the material to go on this album? In my opinion, I really believe the artist had little say on the decision. If so, Bob must have been not wanting to please his fans too much, because the material is NOT his greatest hits. Maybe this disc should be renamed to ""Some of Bob's Hits"". Save your money!"
2,False Labeling. Where are the Rest of Them?,"Sadly, not All of his Greatest? So many great ones MIA here. Amazon review lists them.Is this a set-up/come on for BSGH Vol. 2?Bummer!"
4,excellent collection BUT,Great collection of classic Seger but not ALL of them--need to purchase'other' greatest hits to receive all of his classics. No doubt he representsclassic rock to the hilt!!
5,Great Album - Buy It!!!,"This album is nothing but great. Every song on it is fantastic. Especially the songs ""Still the same"", ""Fire inside"" and ""Night moves"" are classics, to which you can listen all the day and it never gets boring. If you want to listen to a great album, simply buy this one. It`s worth the money in gold!!!!"
5,This is awsome!,"This is an awsome greatest hits for Bob Seger because it really is his greatest hits its not a best of that has songs that really arent his best it has all his biggest hits. Even if it had 'Turn The Page' and 'Night Moves' only it would still be way worth the money. Bob Seger is true American rock and roll! He is one of those non-replaceable rockers! Every song Bob Seger makes is amazing and they are made just for his amazing voice no one else could pull them off and here is his biggest songs, the ones they missed will be on number to but this is a must have even more then the ones on number 2! You'll love this as a blueprint on how to start your Bob Seger collection!"
4,"Now this is some ""Old Time Rock & Roll"".","I can see how a fanatic might be missing some tracks here, but for casual fans this is just about perfect. Anyone who listens to radio should know most of this collection, even if not by title. Included is ""Night Moves"", ""Still The Same"", ""Against The Wind"", and the classic ""Turn The Page"". Plus you get the excellent song ""Mainstreet"", and the anthem for all Chevy truck drivers ""Like A Rock"". I also really like the closer ""In Your Time"". ""Bob Seger"" seems like one of those guys that everybody can like, and this collection is a classic rock must."
5,Bob Seger - Greatest Hits,Very good CD and brought back lots of memories of the old days. Arrived in great condition and quickly.
4,pretty close to the best,"Great CD. Every song is excellent but for an artist like Bob Seger, who has so many big hits, they really should have made this a 2-CD set. Fortunately, there is a ""Volume 2"" now available. If you're just looking for one or two songs here, this is a good album with some extras you might not have thought of. If you're really a big fan though and don't already have this stuff, you're going to want to add Volume 2 to your order."
3,Good Music,Good if you like Bob Seger; purchased CD specifically for his Old Time Rock and Roll single but the other songs are good.
4,Seger at his best,This album has most of the artist's most well-known hits and reflects the classic rock and roll of the 80's. Worth the purchase!
3,Bob Rocks,"It's too bad Capitol didn't take the time and effort to remaster some the older selections on this album as the older ones sound flat compared to the newer ones like 'C'est Le Vie'.What we do have though, is the best of the best with one exception, where is 'Fire Lake'???"
2,Needs cleaning up,"I bought this cd as a demonstration disc. I often sell multiple types of speakers and AV receivers and my demo material is often critical to selling my products. After testing it out on multiple speakers and high quality stereo equipment I will not be using this cd. There is a fair amount of tape hiss on each track in particular ""turn the page.""It is too bad really because I have heard a good copy of his music before and the transfer to this disc is only mediocre. If you are just buying it for fun then you will be satisfied."
4,Prime Seger!!!,"I don't consider myself a big fan of today's Rock & Roll, but I bought this one after watching the movie 'Mask', with Cher, Sam Elliott and Eric Stoltz. It's one of those CD's that you pop in, hit the 'continuous play' option and kick back. 'Roll Me Away' and 'Like A Rock' are my faves on this CD. It's definitely not a 'passer upper'. Turn up the volume and get ready to rock!"
1,My new CD is defective,The CD Bob Seeger does not play all the way to the end it does not work on track 10 or over most times. Can I send it back for replacment?ThanksDon Smith.
4,I Hope He is a Christian,"I have this cd at home. I love this music. This is one of the greatest rock cds of all time. My teacher sais he may be a peagen, I hope not. I love this music1. Roll Me Away-good way to start the cd2. Night Moves-classic3. Turn the Page-ok4. Youll Accompany Me-good5. Hollywood Nights-cool6. Still The Same-ok7. Old Time RocknRoll-classic8.

In Your Time-Only God Knows The FutureI am 16 but I can't give any other info so I cant do the adult review Jesus Loves You God Bless"
1,bad!!!,"I was just listening to this. Oh my god, this is awful!! BobSeger & the Silver bullet band is one of the worst rock bandsever!!! The only good song ever is Fire Down Below from theNight Moves CD. I don't know, this could be better though heshure raises his voice a lot!! Try Against the Wind."
1,I never understood why this guy is popular.,"I never understood why this guy is popular. His music is so.....mediocre, and that's being complimentary. I wish I had a zero star option for my rating, one is too generous. Every time ""Old Time Rock and Roll"" comes on the radio, I turn the dial. I believe Chuck Berry recorded a far superior verson of that a few decades ago, but he called it ""Rock and Roll Music""."
1,Not a fan,"I am not a Bob Segar fan, but my father is. The only reason I checked it out is because I love Metallica and they play Turn The Page on their album Garage Inc. Metallica really fixed the song, check them out."
1,zero stars an option??,"Wow why could Bob seger be so popular??? He is such an overrated singer who just screams cant sing in tune and he could match similar pop singers like Bruce Springsteen, and Mik Jagger. I could think of the single decent song seger has ever done which is still not as good as driving songs by Metallica (Fire down below). What can i say???? Bob Seger is hell baby!! See me at work monday afternoon."
2,disappointed in quality of product,the cd has scratches on it and it doesn't play without jumping on some of the songs. disappointed in the quality.
5,"Quick, perfect and the right price!","Originally I went through all the struggles attempting to purchase this CD from the eBay website. Even after all my efforts, I still did not end up with the CD in hand. Ordering it from Amazon proved to be a snap!! I also was certain that the CD would be in perfect condition upon receipt. Wish I had just ordered it from Amazon in the first place."
1,Worked for only 2 weeks new battery doesn't fix problem,"I bought this item to go diving with, it had a depth rating above what I recreational dive. And I don't have to take off in the pool. I went in the pool, didn't see any water in unit, and the battery went dead, I was told to replace the battery, it worked for about 15 minutes after I replaced battery. Not sure what the problem is, but I'm gonna go back to Freestyle watches."
5,hilarious!!!!,"Stephen Lynch is just one of the most clever songwriters ever. From the first song on this album to the last, me and my boyfriend were laughing out loud, rewinding, and playing again. Not only are his songs funny but they are catchy and you want to sing along. Well worth my money."
4,Laughing Myself Numb,"Like a modern, more foul-mouthed Loudon Wainright III, swooping out of the sky comes...Awesome Man? Drug Free Boy? No! It's Stephen Lynch!Lynch is one of those unique comedians who can make the crassest, most politically incorrect jokes but still be funny. How? He sings them. With such songs as ""Down to the Old Pub Instead"" and ""What If the Guy From Smashing Pumpkins Lost His Car Keys""(a personal favorite), it's hard not to laugh. All that is required is that the listener have a sense of humor about the subjects he approaches and the jokes he makes.Off he flies, toting his guitar whilst singing about the problems posed by PMS and how he would burn druggies and their paraphanalia(if he were Drug Free Boy, that is!). There is no mistaking. This man is no superhero. He's just a freakin' hilarious comedian on a mission."
3,Overrated!!!,"Stephen Lynch Is Pretty Funny Live Or On His DVD's, But Stay Away From His Overrated CD's. They Are Just Not That Funny To Listen To. He Needs More Live CD's Instead. If You Want Funny & Original, Pick Up Bo Burnham's CD, ""Bo Burnham"". Now His CD Is Hilarious!"
3,Charming Musical,"This isn't anywhere near the ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" but it was fun, fairy tale like.After a king's wife has died, he goes on a hunt to marry a girl just as beautiful as his wife. After a long search he realizes, that it's been right in front of him all along. It's his daughter Catherine Denevue. Hearing the disturbing news, she runs away hiding in a donkey skin so she won't be identified. Of course she finds her charming prince who saves her.The best scene in the movie is this surreal scene where Denevue is cooking. I don't want to give it away. But it's unnecessary and completely implausible. I loved it."
2,Weak musical and weak adaptation,"After masterpieces like THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG and THE YOUNG GIRLS OF ROCHEFORD, one would think that the reunion of Jacques Demy, Michel LeGrand and Catherine Deneuve would be magical but the only magic is the kind in the storyline that fizzles.The film takes a bit of a Cinderella turn in the end that is very clichéed.The set decorations coul have been more grand and the costumes sould have been more elaborate."
1,Terrible fairy tale.,"The production values and plot are terrible.I know you're supposed to suspend your disbelief when watching a fairy tale, but this takes the cake.There are so many errors, from the mention of Alaska - which during the period wasn't even discovered, to the appearance of the helicopter at the end - what period is the story set in?Also, the plastic brooms, and the entry to the throne room - why didn't they build a full size door?And what about the poor horses that were coloured red and blue?It must be some high-brow French metaphor which I don't understand.Last, but not least, the music - eeks.Somebody please explain this movie to me."
5,A great fairy tale!,"This great fairy tale features the wonderfull Catherine Deneuve in the main role. I really liked the godmother that brings a little humor to this story. It is definetely a 5 star ""non-animation"" fairy tale, though we know that we don't have a lot of options in this category..."
2,The Parade a/k/a Hit Parade,"An innocent man (Frederic Forrest) is released from prison after serving seven years. His return to a small Kansas town throws the lives of three women (Michael Learned, Rosanna Arquette and Geraldine Page) into turmoil. [Made for tv 1984]"
1,Disappointed,"This is probably one of the worst Ralphie May DVDs out. Being an avid fan of Ralphie, this DVD is really a BIG let down. Majority of the jokes are from the Iraq tour video, available at the end of the 'Just Correct' DVD. Perhaps because this was filmed in Tenn, he is really toned down in his language and uses more politically correct terms, which is not the norm for him. But also the fake Nashville accent he tries to push is very bad. IMO, don't waste your money buying this one, spend it on 'Just Correct'."
3,Earrings OK,I cannot say if the Peridot is real but it does look pretty when I wear them. The craftsmanship of the silver is nothing to brag about either. They are just OK.
3,Husky,"Amy Lee is one of the best singers around at the moment. I do have this song, although it doesn't instantly hit you how good it is as much as their previous single. The video is very dark and shows the group in a concert, with loads of body surfing or whatever its called! The guitarists don't have much to do with singing this song, they did kinda back up singing to Amy in ""Bring Me To Life"". Which is a real shame, as Amy has this brilliant voice, and then you hear the guy singing, and it just completes the song.I always hear one song from a new group etc, but avoid buying the album. I still haven't bought the Evanescence album, but might get it soon. It's on my Christmas list!"
4,"CooL single , no commend about evanescence they roCK!",This song is really cooL and Evanescence .. hmm ..I am not sure that i will use the right words but ill try to explain .. THEy ROCK! They are the best best best ... GroUp in aLL over the world . hey thats my idea because i love pop but i love roCk with evanesceNce! they made me love it . but i heard something which made me very sad. Where is BEN? anyone knows? i dont know ..he left the group and of course amy is a little bit (not little) angry . he left the tour .. hey this is crazy! .. my last words are :GOiNG uNDeR is ReaLLy cooL and you must listen this acoustic version too !
1,Horrible song,"Possibly 3 minutes of the worst rock you will EVER hear! It's so over-rated, it makes me wanna puke. Amy Lee sounds like she's dying a horrible death! She's NOTHING compared to Cristina Scabbia from Lacuna Coil. Want a good rock single? Listen to ""Swamped"" by Lacuna Coil."
3,El Pentago-NO aveces SI,"El CD esta mas o menos bien. Mitad de las canciones son buenas.Pa'los tigueres de la Republica y Puerto Rico aqui van las canciones que son buenas en el CD.1) Easy2) Calm My Nerves (Tiguere El Don Omar)3) Veo6) Mala Es7) Suave Al Oido9) La Mujer De Mi Sueno10) Pide Mas11) Dame De Eso14) Nosotros Dos15) El Brindis (Encendio)Po na, espero que este review haya ayudado a alguien.Dominicano!!!!!!!!!"
5,It's a jungle in that vacant lot near the O.K. Corral.,"The field of Earpiana is indeed a jungle these days, and Glenn Boyer gives his personal perspective on it in The Earp Curse. That perspective is a bitter one, and understandably so in view of his experiences in the ongoing ""Earp Wars."" Perhaps no account of the ""wars"" can be pleasant, but Boyer's trenchant humor may bring an occasional smile or even a more or less unwilling chuckle to readers hardy enough to try this catalogue of the activities of battling historians, ""historians,"" history buffs, and hangers-on."
5,"If you are interested in Kites, read this book!!!!!!!!!!",I think this book is great for people who are interested in stunt kites. It is very detailed and has accurate pictures. This book has pretty good tips. It lists one liners and different gadgets that are perfect for the beach.
3,A book about two worlds,"Which path is right for Billie?The book ""To Walk the Sky Path"" is about a boy named Billie Tommie who lives in Florida's Everglades. Billie is stuck between two worlds--modern and Seminole Indian.I think that this book has too little action. The story doesn't get you interested at the start, so you can't get into the rest of the book.I recommend this book to people who like easy-going books and books about everyday life."
5,"The ""How to"" of spirituality","If you are studying the esoteric and have asked yourself: ""HOW CAN I BECOME....?"" this book will teach you the ""HOW TO"". You must have the will to devote 30 minutes daily to your own advancing consciousness. If you can't do that, buy a book by Plato and read what he has to say about ""Know Thyself."""
2,"A good historic information, but...","This book contains very outdated information from the 1970s and early 80s. While it has a good value as a historic information it lacks in more practical ideas, i.e., *how* to start your own country, as the title suggests."
3,Micro Nations Hobby,"I plan to read this book, soon.Its old,they should up date and revise this book for '08-'09.Its a very intresting book.But out-dated and far-feched.I'd love to start this Hobby and havea micro-nation but its a lot of $,and a Risk."
2,Contains glaring factual errors,"I worked my way through these series of DVDs focusing on the infamous camps operated by the Nazis during WW II. In ""Holocaust - Dachau and Sachsenhausen"", the narrator states that Adolf Eichmann was the Commandant at Auschwitz! This is not true - Eichmann was never the Commandant at Auschwitz, he was the architect of the Final Solution, managing the herculean task of facilitating the transportation of millions of Jews to ghettoes and extermination/concentration camps throughout Europe. The most famous commandant of Auschwitz was Rudolf Hoss, who was eventually hanged for his crimes against humanity in 1947.The footage did not reflect anything new, as most of it has already been covered in other documentaries covering the Holocaust. The focus is more on the rise of the Third Reich and not as much on the camps themselves. Disappointing, rent if you must."
1,Don't waste your time!,This is only a few songs and not the official soundtrack which it mentions several places on this listing. Don't buy.
3,Class textbook for a much better price,"My text was received in a timely manner and in good condition and the price wasn't over inflated like at my college book store, yeah!"
2,Boring Book,"This is not a good book at all. It has some good information in it but, it is hard to stay interested in the topic because the author uses too many descriptive words instead of just getting to the point. This makes it hard to stay focused on the subject and makes the book very boring."
1,NOT the Best Text,"I have taught a sophomore level class in Technology & Society for about 20 years, and long ago quit using the Volti text. Students find the book boring, it is overly superficial and lacks in-depth examples or analysis, and it does not cover many of the issues central to Science and Technology Studies. The book's breezy ""factoids"" are maddening, and unless you are willing to build your entire course around explaining and analysing them, the text will confuse students and encourage shallow thinking.The recent text by Bauchspies, Croissant, and Restivo [Science, Technology, and Society (Blackwell, 2006) provides a much better foundation in the key intellectual issues for STS.The Marcus and Segal text [Technology in America (Harcourt Brace Javanovich, 1989) provides an excellent historical overview--including a periodization that helps students grasp the way technology and society interact and shape our lives."
3,okay,"It was listed as being ""good"" quality, but I would label it as only ""acceptable."" There was writing and underlining all through it, and for the price, I was highly disappointed. Also, when I asked if I could return it since I no longer needed it for the class I was taking, my request was rejected."
4,Great Pictures,"This book has excellent photography, and the narratives are just as good. I would highly reccomend this book to anyone interested in Italian architecture, design, or furnishings. Although the size of this book is rather large, the pictures are very detailed, and show off the intricacies of every design."
1,pretty darn thin,"This book was a big disappointment. Once you remove the appendices (which are of little value) there is less than 90 pages of material, much of which is repeated. It seems the author really had to stretch to get that many pages. The essential information contained in this book could hardly fill a brochure. If you have any desire of trying to crew around the oceans you will quickly lose it reading this book. The only interesting thing I could find in this book was a small map showing cruising routes of the world for the different seasons, information that is available in other fine books that have some substance."
5,great book,This book is full of information on how to disappear and never be found.It even tells you how to obtain a new SS#. If you like this kind of info then you should read this book.
4,"Good On Longitudinal Panels, but not current and almost nothing on Online Access Panels","Good Book.Important Academic treatment on longitudinal panel data. It is really a shame that longitudinal panels and longitudinal analysis is not used more often in market research. It is so much more powerful in many ways than dynamic panels, though there is obviously a need for both. My complaint would be that there wasn't much on static panels, and of course the copy write date, and thus lack of information on online panel data, either static or dynamic. So much of the what has been written on marketing research really needs to be updated now that almost everything is being done Online.If you are looking for something current that deals with Online Panel data you may want to check out Andrei Postoaca's (IPSOS Interactive Services CEO), The Anonymous Elect: Market Research Through Online Access Panels which was just released by Springer.Tom AndersonAnderson Analytics, LLC"
4,"Chart reading, anyone?","So you want to learn on how to read charts... This is the one for you then! A little dense sometimes due to it's completeness on patterns, but it's all there, really. Won't teach you on how to make a trading system, but if you're into discretionery trading systems you'll love this one. I haven't found a reversal pattern that's not on these pages, and if you want to know about continuation patterns, they're all almost there too. I recommend this book for beginners as for experienced traders.This is one of those books I keep next to my trading desk!"
5,Finally getting control of those hedges.,"This is ANOTHER great add-on for my Ryobi trimmer! I hated using my old cordless trimmer, and the hedges in my driveway showed it! This new trimmer is making short work of that chore. Good power and well balanced. With all the TrimmerPlus attachments, my yard has never looked better!"
3,Does the job,With the attachment & the motor together the product is long and ackward. It does what it's designed to do but it's not easy to manuever.
2,Not up to Ryobi Standard,"Purchased the HS720R to trim of the high hedge that surrounds my property. Its not capable of doing the job effeciently.....it is easier to climb the step ladder and wack the scrubs with my Echo single sided trimmer.The HS720R will cut, but mine requires that you go back n' forth several times to make the necessary cut, while the Echo takes just one pass.Also, the length, combined with the power head is kind of clumsy to work with."
1,Ryobi HS720R TrimmerPlus Add-on Hedge Trimmer,"The product that was sent was what I was wanting to use. The problem was that the construction of this add-on was not the same as the add-on that I was replacing. The new equip would not correctly attach to my drive mechanism so I had to completely disassemble the old add-on, using the drive assembly from it in place of the portion of the new addon that wouldn't correctly align with my power unit."
4,"Old book, but refreshing to read","I first read this book in the 60s while in college and found it a little bit of a renegade work. A fresh read now places it much more in the mainstream, I think. Jesus' humanity is truly affirmed here, not to the demise of his divinity, but so many people today do not look objectively at his real life and physical death as we should. It is very readable and rather short. I recommend getting a copy of it and sitting back for a refreshing evenings' read."
3,B-sides are better.,"It's been almost 2 decades since this CD came out. In a book about the PSBs' tour of the time, the author stated that the duo thought this song would compensate for their recent low album sales, but it didn't. I don't recall any of the ""Streets"" mixes being my jam. Standout PSB CD singles include ""Can You Forgive Her?"", ""Paninaro 95,"" and ""This Kind of Thing."" You may get this for nostalgia, but just don't expect to give it an A-plus.I enjoy ""Bet She's Not Your Girlfriend."" I wonder if it says something about the duo's rainbow-flag nature. I loved hearing a line from George Clinton's ""Atomic Dog"" in the ""I Want a Dog"" remix. In fact, I love that PSB don't mind remixing old songs. It shows that they have a strong body of work on which to stand."
4,Working wonderful,"I have ordered this brace to help with my wrist from getting worse as far as pain goes and it is helping tremendously. I would recommend this product to use for wrist problems.I had a brace like this,the same brand and that one is not as good as this. Thanks for making this a better product."
4,Very good but misplaced realities,"This book and its prequel, Camping in the Backyard:Home on Leave, are both very good novels but the author suffers from some misplaced realities. He takes gay realities of the 2000s (hate crimes, open dsiplays of affection both in public and in front of family, ""don't ask-don't tell"" (hinted at but not directly mentioned), etc... and places them in a story set in the early 1960s. If the author had set the story in present day, he would have had a much better novel.Those reveiwers complaining about the editing problems should put less blame on the author and realize this is a common problem with the publisher, IUniverse."
4,Equal parts enchantment and unsettlement,"This is a completely unique story full of folklore, manufactured scientific research on trolls, and homoerotic man-beast love. There's a larger metaphor at work, equating the secret life of trolls with other disenfranchised subcultures. The troll is not the only kept pet in this story.Yes, it was creepy, frightening, violent and disturbing.And I pretty much loved it."
3,.,Too slow and boring at parts but it's a great style and interesting; it's a good book if you just want to try something different.
5,very detailed,one of the best figures ive added to my collection im amazed how much it looks like charlton heston wish it stood up a alittle better but its so awsome i can let that go.
5,Humor and irony abound in a very different kind of vampire story teens will relish,"Colby Blanchard seems your normal American teen: a cheerleader, Daddy's girl: but she's also a vampire. When she has to defend her eternal life in front of a Vampire Council which doesn't care for half-vampires, trouble results - not to mention her romance for Thomas, a hottie Vampire Investigator. Humor and irony abound in a very different kind of vampire story teens will relish."
5,Take a Bite Out of This Great Book,"This is truly a great novel. I've read Serena Robar before and she really continues to write hilarious, relatable novels (well, as relatable as you can get when reading about a Half-Blood Vampire). The characters are fun and you really root for Colby throughout the whole book. You will not regret such a great book. I could scarcely put the book down and finished it in a matter of hours. It is laugh-out-loud funny and fabulously entertaining.It should be mentioned that this is not the first publication of this book. It was originally published under a slightly different name a few years back. Find it here:Braced2Bite."
3,Limited manual controls,"A good camera for a beginner but with limited controls. Neither focus, shutter speed nor aperture control are provided. The most weakness is only multi-pattern exposure available. The picture output is different from other brand such as Canon using the same EV setting."
3,Good But...,"This camera takes great pictures and is easy to use, but I had trouble seeing the screen because I have bifocals and light-sensing coating on the lenses. It helps to use the overhead angle view."
2,gravity games dvd,"I was not impressed with this DVD. For the price, much better ski or snowboard videos can be purchased. The skiing, snowboarding, and snowmobiling was good, but the editing was terrible. The music was repetitive (the each song was used 3 times in the movie). The DVD was not fluid. It was very hard to follow tricks. The movie switches cameras as many as 4 times for one trick. The camera switches are not well timed either. The interviews were not entertaining either. The only people mentioned in the video were the top 2 or 3 from each competition. Even though this was a Gravity Games coverage, most of the competition was not shown."
4,this was a Banging cut back in the day,"I ain't feeling what Outkast has been putting down for a while,but back when they first came out they was on it. this debut cut still is tight. the video version is better than the Album version. dug there lyrical&overall presentation to music making back in the day."
5,Information about totalitarianism,Thorough. Recommended by experts. Terrifying. Necessary to understand Stalin and Russian Revolution. Could happen here.
4,Western civilizations,Had a very good experience buying on line. I don't do it very often. The book was in great shape and it came quickly. I will buy my next books through here.
3,O'Brien hits the doldrums with the 13th in the series,"Hitting this novel after sailing on a bowline through the previous 12 was like suddenly hitting the doldrums. It was very slow moving ahead at times, as the dialogue and description of the intrigue and negotiations of the treaty became painfully dull and tedious. And Maturin's side trip to the monkey shrine seemed like a device for O'Brien to test his mettle writing about fauna and flora--a digression within a digression. I finally got through it (things pick up again once they get out to sea), and am enjoying the Nutmeg of Consolation."
4,"The Thirteen Gun Salute, a great read",The Thirteen Gun Salute is yet another excellent Aubery/Maturin novel from Patrick O'Brian. The Maturin character shows his true colors in this episode.
4,"A ripping yarn, for all love.",Aubrey and Maturin are in fine form in this installment of the landmark series. Well worth the time!
5,Patrick O'Brian series,This is an excellent book in an excellent series. Anyone who likes historical fiction will enjoy this.
1,Shallow and Uninspiring,"I wanted to like this book. I really did. I appreciated the attempt at intertwining two mysteries, separated by nearly one hundred years, into a single conclusion. Unfortunately, each character that I was introduced to, both present and past, rang hollow and flat and incapable of holding my attention. Each were little more than cliches that evoked neither care or concern from me. The ""special"" child, the uncaring & absentee father, the strong yet naive mother, the attractive yet emotionally stunted handyman. None of the characters ever swam in waters deeper than a desert stream.I had hoped to be shocked, frightened or at least concerned while reading this book. Unfortunately, bored was as far as I got."
4,King Zog,"As a collector of Albanian coins, and specifically King Zog era Albanian coins, I found the book absolutely fascinating. A wee bit academic in it's approach, and lacking illustrations, it is still a MUST read book for anyone interested in the Zog period of Albanian history. If you are familliar with Egyptian history of the King Farouk period, you will see many similarities in their reign. Both kings were adept at playing the diplomatic game for a while, only to end up being jerked around by friend and foe alike.The last chapter of the Zog book is especially interesting, as it covers the years Zog spent in exile, jumping from country to country. Somewhat of a sad ending, but the book really made the coins in my collection come alive. Coins, which, are probably some of the most beautiful issues from any nation on the planet during the 20th century."
3,KING ZOG,"I would like also to have contakt with a reader from Kansas City, MO United States about the KING ZOG book that he has found. Please would you give me his mail address or telephone number.I would be grateful if could give me this information.THANK you ."
5,XXL book,"This is XXL book not only in its size and weight, but mostly for the contents. I wish I had similar on other air services of Great War. No doubt is worth the money paid...because it accumulates huge amount of systematic information which helps in orientation among sometimes confusing mess of names and abbreviations of French air service. All planes (even prototypes and concepts) have at last one photograph. For example Nieuports are covered on 70 large pages, SPADs on 50 - monographs of its own. Taking in account the difficulties caused by destroying many of original sources it must take years for the team to produce it."
1,SO boring and biased.,"It was too hard for my 6th grader to read. So, I read chapter one to the kids. So long and boring. It was dripping with disdain about the Christian faith. Maybe it gets better, but I would be bored to death before I ever got there."
3,my opinion on this book,If you are intrested in history read the Double Life of Pocahontas.It is a good book. If you watched the movie it was nothen like the book. The book was way different it has way more information then you can remember. I liked the part in the story when John Smith got stung by a stingray and it and didn't die. Then when he was well again he ate the stingray for dinner. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys to read about history. This book is good for anyone at any age.
2,We're Seeing A Trend From This Author,"This is the second book we've encountered by the famous Jean Fritz and are surprised to find a religious bias emerging. Many Christian homeschool catalogs recommend these books, but I am finding that there seems to be a lot of anti-Christian sentiment in them. It was very pronounced in Around the World in 100 Years. My daughter came to me and read passages that disturbed her in this book about Pocahantas. She said that it came across to her like it was insulting Christians. I was grateful for her insight."
3,A Girl in Two Worlds,"The Double Life Of Pocahontas is the True story of the young indian princess who falls in love with two English men.The reason that Jean Fritz choose this title is because Pocahontas really did have a double life. She started out as a young indian, and ended up as a well tailored christian named Rebbecca. This book was quite engrossing but thoroughly boring"
2,The real story of Pacahontas,"If you like histrical chaacters than you`ll love this book.If you`ve seen the Disney movie it was totaly different.She was captured by the english and they converted her into Christianity.She dressed like the english in their hard soled shoes.They changed her name to Rebecca.She even married an englishman,John Rolfe they had one boy Thomas.He was very interested in Tobacco which made him rich.She didn`t fall in love ith whom you think she may have.i really didn`t like the book because it`s set up as a story of events."
3,Mrs. Woodard's class thing.,"I really liked The Double Life of Pochantus, by Jean Fritz, even though it was a biography. I usually don't like biographies, but this spoke the truth about Pochantas, plus it was intresting. In the movie, John Smith and Pocahontus fall in love. This is not so the case in the book. John Simth and Pocahantus were brother and sister by Pocahantus saving John Smith's life. I don't want to spoil anymore exciting parts of the book. Read it for yourself. You'll see it's short, but yet intreging."
5,This is Everclear's Best CD,I have all 5 of Everclear's albums and this one is definitely the best. It isn't as heavy as World of Noise but it isn't pop like Songs From an American Movie Vol. 1. The lyrics of the songs in this album are meaningful. Some songs such as Herion Girl and Pale Green Stars are sad but others like Santa Monica are more uplifting. If you like Everclear you have to buy this cd.
5,where would i be without it?,I first heard this album back in 96-i can honestly say no album has had a greater influence on my music 'listening' career. The everclear then was completely raw open and forthcoming. These songs may be over played on the radio now.. but everyone should sit down and listen to what art is really saying... stories of a brutally hard adolsence... growing up around junkie and the such. i saw him in 98-they may have being becoming more popular but they played most of this album and hell they rocked...especially heartspark dollarsign accoustic..magic
5,it's definitly good,"It's not as good as So Much for the Afterglow but I'm not sure how to give it 4 and a half stars. Well never the less u should definitly buy this cd. The songs Heroin Girl and Santa Monica are enough to make u buy this cd. I think everyone should buy this cd and So Much for the Afterglow. Also the Eve6 cd, they are good to. Well I guess I should let u go, so u can buy it. just remember THIS CD ROCKS!"
4,this is a great album!!!!!!! one of the best,this is a great album!!!!!!! one of the best!!!! if u are an everclear or anything lover thasn i sugjest that u get this album
5,The best album ever!,"Sparkle and Fade is not only everclear's best album it is also my favorite album by anyone. Elektra Made Me Blind, Heroin Girl, You Make Me Feel Like A Whore, and Santa Monica are rockin' songs while Pale Green Stars and Strawberry add a softer but still kickin' touch."
5,"Heartfelt, intelligent rock straight from the gut","I listen to this album all the time. How many albums--even ones you admire--can you honestly say that about? The songs have a smartness that never gets smug, an edge that never seems preachy, and most importantly, they simply rock. Hard. With a fury and not seen since The Replacements."
5,must have in your cd collection,This cd is by far their best album. I will buy you a new life and wonderful is all that is missing. Great band but Volvo Driving Soccer Mom?? the heck?
3,Sparkles and Fades,"This CD is certainly appropriately named; the first four songs sparkle, and the rest of the CD fades away."
4,another great album,"-another great album from everclear, not as good as some of their newer stuff (they've matured a lot musically since the early 90s) Doesn't anyone else notice this?"
5,Brilliant Dispay of raw emotion and passion,"This is one of the best C.D's I have ever come across.""heroin Girl""is a masterpiece while ""Strawberry""and ""Heartspark Dollarsign""address important issues in a fashion which is nothing short of awe inspiring.The power and raw emotion conveyed in this album swallow me up whole every time I listen to it and it is easily(even now after 4 years)one of the most thought provoking,mood altering albums I have ever heard."
5,I love this cd it's one of my favorites,"I love this cd because the lyrics really mean something. When I do my homework it really gets me moving! Like "" I know, I know, I know!"" In the song Electra mad me blind."
4,Excellent!!,"This album really is great. From Santa Monica to Nehalem, most of the songs have grade-a, quality lyrics. It is a must-hear for anyone who hasn't heard it."
5,If you like SMFTA you will love Sarkle and Fade,"This CD was Everclears first real breakthrough. ""Santa Monica""'s succes set the tone for the band and this CD is jam paccked full og songs you will ove and so know all the words too. Summerland is a great getaway song. You make me feel like a whore is a good song telling about Art's past. The best and possily debateable song is HEroin GirL. Art has but any bad feeling to rest as he insists he made thie characters in the song up. still this is a hard side of everclear that i like. I can pop this album in a listen to it for days. Great job, and keep it up!"
5,This CD is full of good songs.,I think So Much for the Afterglow was good but this is the overall best CD. My favorite song is without a dout Santa Monica.
5,Definition of Music,I'll skip the long speach. But I have one thing to say about this album.IT WILL PACIFY YOU FOREVER.Nothing has ever been written so beautiful.
2,Very Dissapointing!!,"This album doesn't even compare to Sparkle and Fade. This was much more easy listening. Songs like ""I Will Buy You a New Life"" and ""Father of Mine"" got really annoying after the first couple of times that I heard them. The band should go back to their old ways of Sparkle and Fade."
1,Terrible coffee grinder - DO NOT BUY,"I'm really disappointed in this product, usually I am very impressed by the Cuisinart brand. Everything about this coffee grinder is wrong. The one thing a COFFEE GRINDER should do is grind coffee. No matter how long you grind, you always end up with different sized grounds - some fine, some huge bean chunks, none of them adequate to make coffee - it's awful! Also, the design of the product leads to huge messes all over the counter. Little grounds get stuck in the lid, so when you go to put the lid back on to grind again...they all fall out all over your counter. I have to wipe down my counter every time I grind coffee. We'll be returning this product, and buying something better. Save your money, buy a different one!"
2,Poor grinding experience,"This is the worst coffee grinder that I've ever used. I am very dissapointed with Cusinart. The beans do not grind evenly and does not grind fine. This grinder might be OK if you do not like your beans ground fine. If you are used to having your beans ground #5 for automatic cone drip, then this grinder is NOT for you. The only good thing I can say about this grinder is that it has an air tight storage for your ground beans. Pay a little more for the next model up and you will be much happier."
2,Don't buy this one!,"With the Cuisinart name, this should be a good thing, right? Wrong! First, it's noisy. Second, it requires constant pressure on the button to grind the beans. Third, in order to get consistency in the grind, the whole machine needs to be shaken two or three times per fill to get all the beans ground. Don't try to fill the cup to the top, either. It is incapable of grinding that many at one time. Fine grind takes forever, too. This gets two stars because it does grind the beans, but after about five years of only once or twice weekly use, it suddenly developed a hot, electrical smell, and it is being replaced."
5,the pillar of early 90's bronx rap!,this is a hip hop classic! the first reviewer summed it up very eloquently.
5,True hip hop,"You would think that since the album came out in '89 lyrical he would sound common, but he flows better than rappers today. The beats are striaght, but his lyrics gives him 5 mic. From 88-95 rap was on the rise and now it just suck. But not da Lord. He's worth checking"
5,HIP-HOP CLASSIC!! 'NUFF SAID! COP IT!!,"THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TIMELESS JOINTS FROM ONE OF HIP-HOP'S FINESTLYRICISTS. DITC VET, LORD FINESSE AT HIS FINEST! ONE OF THE NICESTKIDS WITH BACK-TO-BACK PUNCHLINE RHYMES THAT WILL HAVE YOU BREAKINYOUR NECK, HOLLERIN' ""DAMN!"" -AND LAUGHING YOUR BUTT OFF ALL AT THE SAME TIME!R.I.P. BIG L !!"
2,A slice of history,"Well, Craver's book might have been ""a must read"" in 1994, but in 2009 it is only background. Mind you, like much of Greenwood's books it is well documented; though Craver often relies on 3rd party reporting of facts and figures. If you are keen in a complete book shelf of library media literature, this is a purchase."
3,cargo mat,The cargo mat is very thin and the edges don't stand up enough to contain spills. I'm disapointed in the quality..
3,Not What I Expected,"I was excited to find a Yoga program that specifically targeted opening up the hips. However, I found myself disappointed by this DVD. This style of Yoga was unfamiliar to me and seemed a little strange. The hip opening section wasn't too bad but was too short to justify the title of the DVD."
4,Fun and Uplifting!,"In my opinion, this is one of the top 2 Ravi and Ana DVDS. It has the catchiest songs and doesn't do at much of the funky wave your arms in the air. It does have some lovely hip and waist movements that are fun. I really like everything about this particular DVD, esepcially that it has 4 alternate workouts on a menu - not all of their DVDs have programmed workouts for you. You don't have to skip around the main menu function if you want a shorter or more focused workout."
5,I truly felt happier and less stressed after this great workout!,"This is by far one of my favorite Ravi and Ana dvds! What an amazing mood uplifter this is! I personally think this is one of their most fun workouts and it was a great hip opener! My hips have never felt better! The sequence for the hip opener is relatively short (15 minutes or so), but what amazing results in such a short period of time! You will feel the results instantly, and with regular use the results will be more long term!This dvd is well worth the money! It is great for beginners-advanced and it is just plain fun! This workout flies by and you will be left with a very positive, clear mind and a great overall body workout! Also I personally enjoyed the cardio in this video! An amazing buy for anyone who loves Ravi and Ana or just enjoys a FUN, EFFECTIVE, MOOD ENHANCING workout! I LOVE it! :-)"
3,Not for me,"I got this video because it really seems to have good reviews, the entire series seems to have good reviews.....But this is just not my type of yoga. I have a few other videos that I feel give me a better workout, the upside to this video is that there are good breathing exercises in it."
2,a little odd.,Was not what I was expecting from the other reviews on here. A bit strange- don't really know how to describe it.
5,"Fun, Invigorating, Eye Opening",This workout combines a thorough hip opening segment with a heart opening set and an abdominal set. I have four of Ana Brett and Ravi Singh's DVDs and this is definitely my favorite.I've heard from yoga teachers that the best way to open the hips is to work the areas surrounding the hips as well as the hip joints themselves as the state of the surrounding areas may contribute to the tightness in the hips. This workout definitely does just that. I always feel invigorated and blissful every time I complete this workout..
3,"Story 5 stars, Writting 2 stars:",I give the story line 5 stars but the writing comes up with only 2 stars. I was very frustrated while reading this book; I was intrigued by the story line but groaned over the writing. It seems to be written for about an 8th grade maturity level. The scenes that are meant to be touching end up coming off as melodramatic. A more advanced writer could have made this a sensational book.
4,Great but complex,"I found the book very helpful but complex. I rated it a four because it is accurate, absolutely correct. I had hoped it would simplify the process but found that other sites or reference material much simpler to understand for a first year student. It is a great guide!"
3,missing pages,pages 30-34 are missing from my copy of the Concise Rules of APA style. Could you please send me another copy?
2,book review,This book is a little confusing. Never arrived when ordered first. I had to reorder this item which finally arrived two months late.
1,Fairly Useless Publication,"I would not recommend purchasing this very limited resource. I bought it to avoid going online every time I needed to look something up, but found that nothing that I actually needed to look up was covered in this overly ""concise"" manual. I found everything I needed online for free."
2,Peculiar Format,"For me, the jury is still out on the APA format. I have to use it for a class, otherwise I would stick with MLA. Regarding this reference guide, it is ok. The format is not intuitive, and I find myself going online to find examples of how to format citations more than I do opening this book."
2,Incomplete,"There's no rules for title pages, no examples of manuscript pages, no rules for pagination. It doesn't even tell you if the reference list belongs on a separate page or what its heading looks like. I consider these glaring omissions, particularly if you are expected to use pure APA and have no departmental style guide (like me). This book is basically a glorified guide to citation and syntactic rules. Avoid it and pay the extra five bucks for the complete book. Getting the cheap book as some kind of protest won't signficantly hurt the APA and it will just make things harder for you."
3,"Good book, lacking in visual references","While this is a great condensation of the main rules needed to write in APA style, this book lacks one major thing -- the practical examples of how to apply APA style in a document or manuscript.The book would be greatly enhanced if in future editions the editors added the examples that are found in the full APA guidelines handbook."
2,My Review,Some peopel may find this book useful. I am just begining to learn the APA format and I did not find this book to be user friendly. I have had better information given to me from handouts from other books.
5,Sing a Whale Song,"This is one of my all time favorites. I have gotten this book and cassette out of our public library so many times it is hard to keep count. As a part-time science teacher, amteur musician and full-time mother of three I recommend this book and music to any child, parent or teacher!!! My only concern is this; if so many people love this book, why is it so hard to get?"
4,A Beautiful Old Nature Book with Beautiful Illustrations 1955,"This is a beautiful book. The colorful illustrations are well done and the book is well organized.It comprises PART I: Hammmond's Nature Atlas of America and PART II: Hammond's guide to Nature Hobbies and is written by E.L Jordan, Ph.De from Rutgers University.This book includes wild animals, birds, wildflowers, fish, amphibians, and reptiles, inssecs, rocks and trees. It gives locations of where each is likely to be found."
3,"Reasonably good Mexican Spanish, TERRIBLE pronunciation guide","This handy new phrasebook is MUCH closer to the Mexican Spanish being spoken today than any other I have found. It's actually pretty good, BUT the pronunciation guide is very, very bad for anyone from the central/western US or western Canada. If you're from those areas and don't already have some idea of correct Spanish pronunciation, avoid this phrasebook.I think the authors must have had some idea about this in advance, since they tell you, ""Don't worry too much about pronunciation."" That of course is totally wrong. Spanish is one of the world's almost perfectly phonetic languages and pronunciation is the MOST important thing about being understood."
4,This book is GREAT!,"However, don't trust the literal translations. But I think this book could get you thru. It has color coded thumb flipping helpers."
4,Great Look,Being a beginner using the tape I employed my 15 year old daughter who is a bit of an an artist. With her assistance it went on easily around the car and looks wonderful.
2,Truly a literary mystery,"I gave this book five stars and it only showed up as two. I don't know how that happened or how to fix it. But it is a five star book!Eliot Sefrin does a marvelous job telling a gritty and compelling story while at the same time showing the reader how the neighborhoods in New York have changed. I was reminded of James Lee Burke's writing as I read Sefrin's wonderful descriptions. Under A Cloud is a book to savor.Marilyn Meredith, author of Wingbeat, a Deputy Tempe Crabtree mystery."
4,Under A Cloud,"The book is a detailed graphic picture of New York City police individuals in the sadly deteriorated streets of Brooklyn's Brownsville district. It is centered around the aftermath of a particular incident and I believe the writer plumbed the depths of the emotions of all those involved creating a very stark and stirring picture of the people and places herein. As for myself, there were times when I was overwhelmed and had to stop to collect myself before I could read on. I recommend it."
4,Easy to follow introduction to the world of Access 2000,"While researching a project at work, I was introduced to Microsoft Access 2000 as a possible reference for a question.I found the text well designed and easy to read.

1,Don't buy it!,"Very, very poor video! Couldn't watch for more than ten minutes. Amazon.com should NOT sell such low grade stuff."
4,Bought as a gift. Well received,My wife had been looking for this book for some time and was more than pleased to receive it as a Christmas present. It has been out of stock in local brick and mortar stores for several months. It arrived on time and as expected.
2,"A great idea for a book, but messed up by authors' poor job","A great idea for a book, but the book is messed up by the authors' silliness and self-indulgence. Had the authors just dealt with their topic, it would be five stars. Instead,the book suffers from two major problems. First, almost every paragraph is replete with childish ""inside"" jokes, sophomoric asides (invariably Lefist where they are politifal), imbecilic puns and similar self-indulgent stupidity, apparently included to show how clever the authors are. Instead, all this junk just distracts from any discussion and generally leaves the reader grinding his teeth in annoyance. Second, there are serious and repeated errors in the descriptions of the movie plots. Did the authors actually watch all the films discussed, or did they rely on others (grad students, perhaps?) for some of the material? My conclusion is that the topic is well worth a book, and its a shame the authors made such a mess of this one."
4,Good starter book for Excel,I was looking around to find a book that does a good introduction to Excel with screenshots that I wanted to suggest for a friend. This is a nice book to read and get to know Excel step by step.The author takes you through a step by step approach with an example to create a budget excel sheet.Pros: Very good starter bookCons: There could have been more examples.There is a sample chapter available on the publisher's site and example workbooks are available on the author's website.
5,USB Printer Cable,This printer USB Cable is perfect. I bought it to connect a printer to my son's laptop. All I had to do is plug it into the laptop's USB port and connect to the printer. The laptop recognized the printer right away - no driver loading necessary. He was able to print in a minute.
1,Doesn't work with the Canon BJC-80,"I tried this parallel-to-USB cable/converter with my Canon BJC-80 and, despite other claims, it doesn't work. Don't waste your money -- you get what you pay for!!!"
1,Did not work with HP 5P printer and Vista,"Vista recognized the printer, but would not print. Most reviews ( I read after buying this cable) say that HP printers won't work with this type cable. I recommend installing a parallel printer card instead of trying this cable.Since writing the above review we discovered that some of the computer USB ports were not functioning. This was subsequently fixed but I am unable to retest the cable."
2,Product did not work,"Tried to use the product, it DID NOT work, bought a new cable from another store and everything worked fine. Returned the product and waiting for credit on my credit card for its cost and shipping!!!"
2,USB to Parallel,It is well made etc. but only works on printers. No good for any other digital control operation. Very hard to get working for a non geek operated Linux system.
1,Did not work at all,"I tried to use it with a Windows 7 notebook computer and an HP DeskJet 820Cxi printer.After connecting the devices the computer looked for the driver and found one that was not the exact match. It was a Cxe instead of Cxi. It could had worked but did not. The test sheet went to the queue, stayed there but never got printed out.After that I found and manually installed the exact driver. Hoped it would work this time. Everything looked perfect. The computer saw the printer, it said the printer was ready but the test sheet never got printed out. The computer sent the print job to the printer but it did not ever show up in the queue. And so the printer did not print anything.Other than the test sheets recommended by Windows I tried MS Word doc and pdf files with the same results.After many hours of trying I gave up and returned the cable.Amazon was very gracious refunding the full price and shipping."
1,Did not work with Windows 7,"My item arrived today. When I plugged it into the USB port of my computer, it showed up as an unknown device. After several attempts to get it to work, including going to the Sabrent website and downloading their Windows 7 driver, it still did not work. I had ordered a SYBA USB to Parallel Cable at the same time as a back up. Using the same USB port, Windows 7 recognized it immediately. I plugged the original printer cable into this cable, and within two minutes I was printing. For the price, it was well worth it for me to buy both types of devices. If Sabrent refunds my money, great. In the mean time my printer is working."
1,Does not work on LaserJet 4,"I purchased this device (Sabrent 6-Ft USB TO PARALLEL PRINTER CABLE) so I could continue to use my workhorse LJ4 with my HP a6857c running 64 Bit Vista. The packaging material said it included a driver cd. There was no CD in the package. When I plugged into the USB port, it did not recognize the printer. I used the add a printer wizard, but when I designated an open USB port, it wanted either a driver cd or something from online. I have not been able to get the system to recognize my printer yet. Very frustrated. Update: Finally got it installed, but the test print page only produces a single line of garbage at the top of the page. I am returning it for a refund. I cannot recommend this device."
5,See below for printer models...,"I used it to connect an old Canon BJ-200E printer to a new Dell desktop. Win XP did indeed recognize and install the printer as soon as I plugged it in - no additional drivers were necessary - but I still needed to run the ""Add Printer"" wizard to get it to appear on my printer list. Then I went into the printer properties and switched from the standard printer port to USB. That was it. **Note that the manufacturer specifies WIN 98SE/2000/XP and Mac OS v8.6-9.2.From the manufacturer, here's the list of printer models supported:HP Deskjet: 420,500C,520C,670C,692C,695C,710C,750,850C,870C,890C,895,1100C,1120CHP Laserjet:III P,4,4PLUS,4P,4L,4V,5P,5L,5M,6P,6L,2000c,2100M,4000,5000Canon BJC:30,50,70,80,200,200eX,210,210SP,230,240,250,255sp,4000,4100,4200sp,4300,4650,6000,7000Epson Stylus:Color 300,400,440,600,740,800,850; Photo 700,EXEpson PM:700C,750C,2000CEpson EPL:N1600Lexmark:XJ-350,1100Panasonic:KX-1121"
1,Not for a mac,"I bought this cable for my old reliable hp deskjet with a parallel port. I bought a new iMac and wanted to use it with it.The description on the website says use with a mac but the packaging only listed windows applications.I tried it on the mac anyway and it didn't work. It wouldn't even ""see"" the printer.I then tried to hook up the printer to a windows vista laptop and it wouldn't work either.Don't know where the problem lies but cable didn't work for me."
2,Didn't work- WIndows 7- HP Deskjet 350,"Purchased this to try and get an HP Deskjet 350cbi Mobile printer connected.The installation process seemed to work, regarding the USB device driver.HP, and Microsoft KBase, both said that the driver provided during the normal online Windows search process, should work!Instead, I got different errors; 1) the USB port was not functioning, and 2) saying the Print Spool service had encountered an error. I will be returning this cable and trying other options."
1,Not worth the cost,"This cable may work on some combination of computer and printer, but did not work at all on mine. Between the cost of shipping and cost of the cable, it was a waste for me."
4,It works,"The product arrived with little instructions and no software. All I did was attach the cable to the printer and the computer. My PC, running Windows 7, immediately recognized it. I did not have to download any additional software or printer driver. I works perfectly."
1,OS X 10.,"I bought this cable to use with a Mini Mac running OS X 10.4.8 and a HP Deskjet 1120C but have been unsuccessful in getting it to function.Cable comes with many drivers on a mini CD-ROM, but nothing for OS X. I tried some openSource drivers but with no success. An e-mail to the manufacture yielded no response."
3,Smegma UNHAPPY with NO function,It did not work -- RETURNED.I gave it 3 stars because it was solidly built and GREAT price ...
2,may not work in my situation,"So far, I haven't been able to get my HP 4L working with my new computer, running Vista. It looks like it installs, but I can't print to that printer. And I'm about out of things to try."
1,"worked well the first time, after that.....","when i first plugged the cable to the pc - so it will be recognized-, it worked well... but after restart i don't know what happened but windows xp couldn't recognized it at all... think is a cable failure because i tried in 2 computers and the same problem happened"
3,Didn't work with iMac,"It seems like a well-made cable, but it didn't provide the necessary communication path between a new iMac running OS X 10.8 and an HP LaserJet 2100. The connectors fit into the proper places, but the Mac couldn't talk to the printer.Our second purchase was a Sewell USB to parallel cable from sewelldirect.com. It worked! [Make sure you get the new HP drivers for OS X 10.8 that were released earlier this month.]"
3,USB to Parallel 6-Foot Printer Cable,"Worked OK. Printer has now crapped out, so it is now longer needed. If you want more than this you are not getting any review from us at all."
2,Can't use it.,Wrong one. Need 25 pin parallel adapter to USB. Sorry couldn't use it found one with 25 pins.Charles Puma
3,Sabrent USP to Parallel printer cable,"First unit did not work, second did. Provides USB to printer interface as advertized, however not the best quality and setup can be a little clugey. Sabrent support is the worst ever! 5 notes to them, only two responses and both answered a different question than asked! Would not respond to a request for warrantee service on the failed unit.I will never purchase another product from Sabrent."
2,Not 6 Feet!,This product description is wrong. The cable is 5' in length (barely) not six. If you needed a 6 ft. cable (like I did) this will not be long enough for you.
1,not 6 feet!!,"I've returned this item once because the cord is not 6 feet long, more like 3 feet. They sent me a replacement promptly, but with the same incorrect product. When I notified Amazon again that it was the wrong product they said the problem was greater than they thought and I could have a refund. If you want a 6 foot cord, don't buy this."
1,Does Not Work At All,I have an HP LaserJet 6P and I recently bought a new computer that had no parallel port. I bought this cable as the manufacturer claimed that I would be able to print by connecting the printing with this cable to a USB port on my new computer. It does not work at all and was a complete waste of money. I have not been able to get support from the manufacturer.
1,Didn't work with HP DV8T Windows 7 laptop,"I failed to see what was missing in the description, but apparently this type of cable does not work with Windows 7. Waste of $10 for me, gave to a friend who runs XP on his machines."
5,Sabrent SBT-UPPC USB to Parallel 6' Printer Cable,"As far as I can tell, the cable was just fine, It just turned out that I didn't need it after all, and I returned it."
5,USB to Parallel conversion cord,My new motherboard didn't have any sockets for the Parallel port built into the board. Rather than order the associated parts for the port mounted on a backplane slot cover I ordered this cord as I have a lot of USB ports available.I couldn't get the Win7 computer to recognize the connection so I went into the control panel and told it to search for new hardware - BAM it found it and has been working flawlessly for several weeks now. You can also go into printers and devices and add a printer which causes it to search for connected printers and it will make the connection.Always physically do the search for new hardware when you change connections if the USB system doesn't see your connection.Works great!
3,Exactly as Description,This item is as exactly as described in the product description. Personally I returned the items and go new printers as the printers i was trying to hook up were not campatible with windows 7. Had i had a newer printer it probably would have worked.
3,Seems to work fine but it's not 6 feet,"'Bought this roughly one month ago for a Vista 64 bit system using a ten year old Lexmark color jet printer. It was simply plug & play & works just fine. I paid ~$15.00 which was a good price relative to other prices out there. The Amazon price as I write this is ~$3.00 cheaper which is fair given that the unit I received measured from head to toe is actually only 5 feet. So it might be worth asking if given the new lower price, it is now actually only 4 feet! 'Wasn't worth the hassle to return it but do take note especially if you need the advertised length."
1,Doesn't work on Windows Vista!,"Tried this with two different computers using Windows Vista. Got this message: ""One of the USB devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned, and Windows does not recognize it."" The mini-disk that came with it was no help. No response from Tiger Direct. Went to Radio Shack and got one. It works."
1,Didn't work for me,I got this USB Parallel Converter Cable to work with my laptop which runs on Vista and an older HP Deskjet. This product didn't work for me. The disk that came with it was of no help. The cable looked a bit flimsy but I gave it a try anyway. There was little information on the website. I returned it to TigerDirect with no problem and received a refund also with no problem. I then ordered the cable a similar(sturdier and slightly higher price) cable from CompUSA. It was plug and play and I've been printing ever since.
2,Works for me; shorter length than advertised,"PRO:1. This cable worked for me...eventually (see below)2. This cable is USB 1.1 and USB 2.0 compliantCON:1. I did not have success with this cable following the included (austere) instruction sheet. (However, the instructions provided at Sabrent's website were sufficient, and I was eventually able to get my parallel printer working with this cable.)2. The advertised length of this cable is 6 feet, but its actual length (tip to tip) is only 5 feet. Interestingly, the cable's packaging doesn't reference a length at all. I let Amazon know, but they have yet to update the product description.OTHER:My printer is an HP LaserJet 5P. I'm running MS Windows XP Home."
1,Doesn't work with Vista or Windows 7,"I hooked it up to 2 laptops, one with Vista and one with Windows 7. Both recognized the printer but nothing would print out."
1,Salavaged its cost when I bought a new printer,"Sabrent SBT-UPPC USB to Parallel 6-Foot Printer Cable did not work with Windows Vista on two serial printers: HP LaserJet III and Epson Stylus Photo 820. It does work with Vista and a brand new Brothers HL5250DN. This monchrome laserjet has a serial port connection, so I used the Sabrent SBT-UPPC USB to Parallel 6-Foot Printer Cable to connect it to the CPU. This saved me the cost of buying another USB cable. In hindsight I should have simply bought a new printer, the day I bought my new computer."
1,USB to Parallel Printer Cable,Sabrent SBT-UPPC USB to Parallel 6-Foot Printer CablePurchased this item to use between Windows Vista and an Epson LQ-870 printer. Cable does not work. Cheaper model than the Belkin and I should have purchased the Belkin. That cable does work.Sorry Amazon...afterall it is only money!
1,Did not work-bought a Belkin-it worked,"After countless hours of trying all the suggestions shared in the reviews, I finally did as another did and bought a Belkin brand. Bingo. It was recognized immediately, and I was printing in less than two minutes. I'm not sure what the probelm is with the Sabrent brand, but for me, there was no way to get it to work. P.S. I gave a one star because the price was considerably less than the Belkin (but then again, who cares, if it doesn't work)."
5,Worked great,Finally able to use my dinosaur laser printer again! Cable worked as expected...Received promptly!
1,Sabrent 6 foot Printer Cable,"I installed it and it worked once. Then it stopped and we had to keep fixing it. But after a few more tries, it stopped working altogether and we gave up."
4,Worked Great,Had my doubts after reading some of the reviews but worked great. Windows vista recognized the driver right away without the need to use their installation cd that came with it. Used with a HP Laserjet 6P printer.
1,Does Not Work for HP Laserjet 6L,I bought this cable for my HP Laserjet 6L and it did not work at all. Don't waste your money and time. This is the second time that I've bought a USB to Parallel cable from Amazon that did not work. Ultimately I bought the Dynex USB to Parallel cable from Best Buy and it worked. The cable from Best Buy cost a lot more ($30) but it worked. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,Did not work.,I am in the IT business and tried this cable with a HP Laserjet 2100 (which only has a parallel port). My XP PC would sense the adapter but would not communicate with the printer no matter what port I choose.
1,Limited useage,"I bought this for hooking up an old dot-matrix computer. It does not work. There is a link somewhere for the list of printers it does support, I would suggest following that 100%. It's a rather small list. Very disappointing that it says 'works with most models'. Bought a generic cable from staples (for $40) and it works fine. Make sure you do your research before buying this product."
1,Did not Work,"This product disappointed. Apparently, it is effective for some older printers, but not all. It did not work with an older portable Cannon printer. If you are fortunate enough to be able to borrow one first, do it before you buy."
2,UPDATE - Doesn't work so great on iMac and HP4200,"Well, after having used this for about a month now, it's not such a great cable. Yes, it connected easily, but any time there is a graphics-heavy job, or even just some text to print that's more than 2 or 3 pages long, the job somehow gets 'stuck' in the cable; it doesn't seem to have enough memory to send the job to the printer. Then it totally jams up the printer and it's impossible to clear the print queue without disconnecting the cable for about 5 minutes and rebooting the printer. It was cheap, but this was a waste of money. You get what you pay for....<Just purchased new iMac - no parallel port for my HP Laserjet 4200, so I thought I'd try this cable, even though some of the reviews were not so favorable. Just plugged it in and it recognized my printer instantly and worked perfectly. Amazing buy for $12!>"
3,"This might work for you, but didn't for me.","I bought this to work with my old printer, but there must be two different kinds of parrallel ports, because this one doesn't fit my printer. So if you buy this double check! I could return this item, but the shipping would cost almost as much as the item itself so it looks like I'm stuck with it."
3,Incorrect Lable,"I received the cable, and I installed it and it is working fine (at least, I haven't run into any problems with it yet). It came with a mini-DVD with the drivers on it, but my Win7 system found and installed the necessary drivers automatically. The only issue I had was that the package was labled as ""USB 2.0 to Serial (9-pin) DB9 RS-232 1-FT Adapter Cable"". Of course, the cable that I needed, received, and installed was not that cable. I picture a guy in a garage that grabbed the cable out of a bin, grabbed the packaging lable out of another bin, slapped them in a standard package and shipped to me. But the bottom line is that I got what I wanted in a very timely fashion, so I am happy."
3,Didn't work on Compaq/Lexmark - No response to E-mails,"It worked perfectly with my HP Laserjet 4L, but I could NOT get it to work with my Compaq IJ700 (with is made by Lexmark). E-mail to Sabrent Tech-Support was not answered.I realize the HP 4L is listed as a compatible printer on the packaging, while there's no mention of the Compaq. But still ... they could have answered my short e-mail."
1,Beware if you're buying this for an HP Laserjet 4L!,"I purchased this item based on the manufacturer-supplied statement that the adapter was compatible with my HP Laserjet 4L printer. When the item arrived and I attempted to mate it to the printer's male connector, the blue plastic piece on he adapter was too wide to fit with the printer cable. I have now returned this item and ordered the Sabrent USB to DB25 adapter cable, which I am hoping will work for me. There's nothing inherently wrong with THIS item; you just can't believe the manufacturer's statements on compatibility. Check your printer's adapter beforehand."
2,"Defective cable, but some technical support","After following the installation instructions on three different computers, I was unable to complete a print job to an HP laserjet 5mp from Win2k, WinXP or Mac Leopard. The device and printer were installed correctly as far as the computers were concerned, but print jobs would disappear from the print queue immediately without printing. Sabrent tech support did respond to my e-mails but after two days of troubleshooting possible installation problems I simply purchased a replacement cable from another manufacturerUSB Parallel Converter Cable DX-UBPC.Note that regardless of cable manufacturer, you have to follow the instructions carefully to first initiate USB printer support in your operating system before trying to install the printer itself."
1,Does not work on all parallel ports,"I wish I could say this worked, but it didn't even match the cable on my HP LaserJet 6L.The title of the item should be more specific that this is not meant for all parallel port printers."
1,Doesn't Work w/Canon BJ-70/80,"Despite what the label says, it will not work with the parallel port Canon BJ70/80 portable printers. I spent hours trying different configs and the Canon Support website. No luck. Called Canon. Very nice people on their end. But no driver support for this really nice little printer for anything higher than Windows 98. Look carefully before buying this item."
1,Laptop to printer cable 6 ft,"Great product, exactly what I needed. Fast shipment and outstanding customer service from Tiger Direct after I accidentaly made a duplicate order. Highly recommended supplier."
1,no performance,After attaching the cable properly to my HP Laserjet 5P andmy new Dell Vostro PC the cable worked for several days andthen stopped working.
4,CD & Cord,"The model # is indeed SBT-UPPC, although it does not say Sabrent. Upon inspection, I found the mini-CD inbetween the cardboard insert sides. It could be missed if you werent expecting a mini CD inside the insert...The cord alone measured 7 feet, not counting the connecting ends."
2,Short and Broken,"It's 5 feet long, not 6 feet. And one of the pins on the Centronics connector was bent, rendering it unusable. I sent it back and used another cable instead."
1,No good for Mac,"I bought this to connect my Macbook laptop to an HP Laser printer. No luck. The computer didn't even seem to see the printer- I never even got as far as selecting a driver. The tiny little mini-CD that came with the cable had nothing on it but PC drivers anyway.It was cheap, so it was worth a try, but if you have a Mac, look elsewhere!"
2,Short by one foot,"The product was advertised as a 6-foot cable, but it is only a 5-foot cable. Oddly enough, the packaging neither mentions its length nor its brand name. The shortness of the cable made my equipment setup more inconvenient than it should have been."
2,Unsure whether its the cable or computer.,It's difficult to say whether the problems I'm having are because of the cable or the printer. The setup works fine and the setup was fairly easy. The problem is that I have to delete the old printer setup and create a new printer setup each time I log in to the computer. That gets a bit old. I suspect the problem is with the printer and how it is supposed to communicate with the computer. I have a HP LaserJet 5L and Windows XP. I've since moved the 5L back to my old computer with its parallel port.
1,Can't make it work...,"Poor documentation crate confusing set up and had hard time makeing it work with my old HP5L Laser printer. My system only wants to print when I plug in USB plug after Windows finish booting up and only after I plug it in with printer already turned on. If I forget to turn on printer before sending my print job, it will refuse to print. After trying to make it work for few weeks, I gave up."
1,Does not do what it is supposed to,"I bought the cable to connect my new HP laptop (Vista) to an HP Laser Jet 5p printer. The laptop recognized the cable but could not recognize the printer. I then tried a Radio Shack cable with the same specifications, and this worked perfectly. The Sabrent cable was clearly the problem."
1,Sabrent SBT-UPPC USB to Parallel 6-Foot Printer Cable,This cable doesn't work for connecting a Mac G4 (version 10.4.11) to an Epson Stylus Photo EX.
2,gotta read it,"Thia is Ellroy at his best----which is quite a claim because if you/ve read any of his other writings, it's difficult to make this statement.Moody, rich with a sense of place and time,it's a terrific read.This story has been told before by an assortement of writers--some good, most forgettable. John Gregory Dunne wrote the sensational""True Confessions""--this novel took some license from the Betty Short story----when did anyone ever call her Beth??????Read it!!!"
1,Don't waste your time,"I read this book as a selection for my book club. After all the fan fair, this book was a complete disappointment -- and let me tell you, we've read some bad books in the past. This one takes the cake. I can get past the fictional aspect of the book; however, the supposed ""great writing"" is just not there. I found this book to be very superficial, although the story line had great promise. A considerable struggle to get through and little if any flow to the writing."
2,Bad read,"This book is not very good. It is truly fictional like the author says, it is more about two men chasing after the same women."
2,The Title Is Confusing,"After going about 1/4th of the way through the book, I can't understand why its called The Black Dahlia. This is a book about BOXING! Lots of boxing related narrative here. There's some cop stuff too, but only boxing cops. If you like boxing, this is the book for you."
2,Black Dahlia,"Please, don't pay attention to 4 star's customer's review. The book is boring. I've read such better books than this one and they don't make the movies - I don't understand why. My first Ellroy's book is probably the last one."
3,"Not Great, Not Horrible","I am a Criminal Justice student and soon to be police officer so I look for facts, and this book is CLEARLY a novel. Mr. Ellroy, who is a disturbed man to put it nicely, decides to make an innocent girl who is victim of a horrendous crime look like a common whore. I know a lot about the real Dahlia case and Elizabeth Short and the information he pushes about he is just complete crap. I know this is a novel but those people who will just read this book and not learn anything about the real case and Miss Short will be greatly misinformed. I would also worry this would happen to those that saw the movie, but as far as I know about ten people actually saw it.Overall its not a bad read but its not a page-turner. When I find a book I really like and am excited to read it takes me about a week to read it. I forced myself to read this book and it took me four months. Instead I would recommend a book such as True Blue, or COP, they are much better police stories and they are real."
5,"Ellroy's best, which says a lot","James Ellroy's The Black Dahlia is the greatest piece of crime fiction ever written. Period. The characters are complex and fully developed, the LA setting is flavorful, which is to say, repugnant, dark, and ugly, and the police procedures described lend credibility to Ellroy's crackling, jazz-riff prose. A masterpiece from one of our very best writers."
4,Interesting twist on old story,"Enjoyed story line, was an interesting twist on and old story/cold case. If you are a purest Dahlia fan you may not care for this story line."
5,Dark and sad,"Much darker and down as compared to the movie. Like real life and unlike the movies the evil ones aren't always brought to justice. The relationships between Fire, Ice and Kay are more defined, much more sinister and much more believable. Not for the time you need an upbeat ending."
3,Just not enough thrill,This book starts very slowly where the author does not begin the murder scene till chapter 7. I was quite disappointed because this mystery book just couldn't keep me interested. There are some scenes where it was very exciting which are mostly located at the climax but overall it was a disappointment.
3,a serpent feeding on its tail,"Ellroy masterfully creates an ammoral, cruel, predatory, self-consuming late-forties Los Angeles in *The Black Dahlia*. If you read the book, you'll see that the murder of the Black Dahlia and the nature of the corpse, once discovered, is the novel's central metaphor. The novel explores the human bowels of darkness and just as the people in this story consume and devour one another, the novel's plot becomes more and more focused as the story begins to devour itself. If you lean toward movies like *Seven* or *The Cook, the Thief, etc* or any other stories of disembowelment and dismemberment, this book is for you."
2,"So grotesque, it's funny","I was darned disappointed by the ending to a pretty great buildup. The Sprague housing corruption angle and the father-(step)daughter tryst was just too derivative of CHINATOWN, while the ending read like dexadrine-fueled Grande-Guignol mashed up with Peter O'Toole's MACBETH. Like the audience in the latter, I actually found myself laughing at the kitchen-sink grotesquery ((...)). And Kay's re-think of her relationship with Bucky...talk about your venus ex machina. Her apology for coming between him and the Dahlia is about as misplaced as Harry Whittington's my-bad to Dick Cheney. A page-turner for 300 pages; a book-tosser for the last 80."
1,I just wanted to finish it to move on to my next book,I received this book as a gift. I read in this genre from time to time and usually the pace of the books is riveting. Here I was very restless and not interested in the characters. So many things happened that seemed far-fetched that I couldn't give the author much confidence. In the end I was happy to finish the book to just be done with it and disappointed at the ending.
1,The Black Dahlia,"I received great service for this item, but I didn't like the book. It was hard to understand and seemed to have too many stories going on. I did not finish reading the book."
1,COVER RIP-OFF OF GILMORE'S SEVERED,"I was shocked to see this cover; a deliberate ripoff of John Gilmore's book, SEVERED. I have owned and read the novel by James Ellroy. This is a make-believe story of the Black Dahlia, with no truth to it at all (I imagine the same as the forthcoming movie made from this novel). I have read the comment by the distinguished Colin Wilson about Severed: ""The best book on the Black Dahlia--in fact, the only reliable book."" If you want a crass, kooky, fantasy tale, read Ellroy. If you want the truth, read Gilmore. Enough said."
1,The Black Dahlia Fiction,"If you know any information regarding the actual 1947 unsolved case, I'd be surprised if you like this book! Nothing like taking a famous murder case and writing it into such a made up joke of a story!! Did I mention that it was boring as well? makes you wonder why the author couldn't come up with his own story line, rather than creating a fictional oddity around such a famous murder? While reading, I kept thinking this has got to get better....don't waste your time, I can answer that for you, it doesn't.....to sum it up, the unsolved murder theme, the actual storyline, and the buck tooth character, equals one LOUSY READ."
2,Work!,"Reading this was hard work! I was never looking forward to picking it up, to see what came next. I need to like at least one carachter and I didn't."
5,RIVETING READ,Ellroy weaves a tale of riveting suspense--you won't be able to put this one down! A true masterpiece! Highly recommended.
4,Being able to multi-task is great!,"This book is really good. I always try to read the book before seeing the movie because the bookks are always better. I purchased the book on CD so that I could multi-task. My life is so busy with work, kids and building a house that I never have the time to sit down and relax with a good book. It's certainly not as enjoyable but now I can listen while driving to work, listen while on break at work, listen while I do dishes or other household chores and when I'm stuffing insulation in my new house as well. The book is graphic and should not be listened to in the presence of young children so use headphones when ever possible. I would recommend this book and any book on CD to all mystery lovers."
3,Hard to care about these characters,"The atmosphere is good and you really feel like you have gone back in time to another era but the story fizzles and there are really no characters that you can respect enough to like admire or care about. Also, there are way too many coincidences that really make it difficult to suspend disbelief even with a strong effort. It was a bit hard to put down at times and at first you really want to know what is going to happen/solve the crime etc.. By the end, I found it harder and harder to pick up and finally, I didnt care at all."
5,A razor sharp walk on the dark side of 1950's LA,"Action, plot, suspense, intrigue, and some of the most intensely drawn characters ever to see the printed page are all par for the course in this masterpiece from Noir virturoso James Ellroy. His characters and dialogue are as sharp as broken glass, while the web he weaves around the entire story brings everything hurtling together suicidially at the end of the novel. A must read."
4,"Great, but don't read about the real 'Black Dahlia' before","I stumbled across the 'Black Dahlia' case while looking into LA Noir titles, and read the real story. I bought Ellroy's book, and enjoyed it immensly, however I was constantly comparing his investigation with some of the known facts from the case. There's one point (I won't ruin it by giving it away here) that came out much later about Elizabeth Short that sort of invalidates all of Ellroy's investigation, so I probably didn't enjoy it as much as I would had I not read up on the actual case. Still I would highly recommend it as a crime novel, and it ranks right up there with Chandler and Hammet, only with a little bit of hindsight."
2,All the investigation for nothing,"First of all let me tell you that this book could be written in 250 pages or less, the other 250 or so are things that has nothing to do with the book, for example the fight between Bucky Bleichert and Lee Blanchard and the way they were training for the fight, I can give some more examples.The book has really nothing, no matter if it was real, and at the end the person who did the murder, well nobody does nothing to catch him and they knew who was.And in the other hand, all the investigation was for nothing, at the end of the book you will see that even if there were no investigation at all they will find who was the murderer."
2,SELF-INDULGENT GEEGAW,"Sorry, can't join the herd who've swallowed this as good writing. Like AMERICAN PSYCHO, it's got the verbal runs. Good talent at getting words out, no problem there. But what it all means is close to zero. I agree with another reviewer, here is one highly overrated writer. Ellroy has had his two hours of fame. Lets not hog the spotlight, James. Go to sleep, like I do when I try reading your work. Boring. To others, good luck with it."
3,Unforgettable human evil pervades its pages.,"This is not a great book. The writing is so-so. Characters are poorly drawn. There isn't really a sympathetic or appealing characterin sight. But after many pictures of ugly Americans involved in thestory, I cannot shake the vivid diary accounting of the torture of the victim. I wish I could. It brings you too closely into the mind of a crazy and sick killer. Horrible."
5,Keep A Stiff Drink Handy When You ReadThis Book,"All I can say about the Black Dahlia is that it's go fo broke vision of obsession, sex and death will leave you shaken, amazed, and thirsty for a stiff drink of that something that burns going down. Ellroy's fictional investigation into LA's most notorious and very non fiction unsolved murder is part ""Apocalypse Now,"" part ""Chinatown,"" and all darkness."
5,The Christmas Party,"Chari has written a very entertaining murder mystery.You may figure out how the murder was committed ,but you won't guess who did it!This book can be read in one sitting which makes it a great evenings entertainment.I would recommend this book to anyone."
2,too bulky for baby biorb,The plants looked cheap and obviously fake and it took up too much space in my baby biorb. The fish hardly had any room be swim about.
2,"Pretty, but...............","I was pleasantly surprised to find this item. Ordered one and am definately pleased with the appearance of the ring in the biorb. BUT after having it in there a few weeks I'm fighting a battle of green tinted water. Nothing else in the tank is new so has to be from the plant ring. Not sure how the ""tint"" will effect the fish so removing the ring to be safe........... money wasted."
4,"Deep House, a bit dark, a bit tribal","I don't know all the tracks, still I can confirm the sound is really appealing, involving, trance-wise with vocals Moby-style...I suggest the new unbelievable Promo Single ""Departure Lounge Black Vynil"": it's one of the underground hit in teh best club of Italy and soon Europewide. can't miss it!"
5,AC Adapter works just fine as a replacement,"This charger was bought to replace the old one, and when I plugged in the new charger, it fixed the problem with the clock radio, so I discarded the old adapter."
2,Joyfull noise,"First heard Bonepony on my favorite radio station, KFAN. Wanted this CD, but it was out of print. Lucked into a used copy. If you like The Band, Little Feat, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, or others have have taken equal part bluegrass, rock & roll, coutry & western, folk, and any other genre that appealed to them, crammed them into a blender, set the controls on warp drive, and let her rip, you will love this CD. Sorry that should be 4 Stars"
3,"nice, lightish, good time music","It's too bad the recording's hard to find. The band's in the alternative-folk sound that the record companies thought would catch on, and didn't really (mother hips-ish). Not as good as uncle tupelo, because they're not quite as deep or moving, but a fine effort none the less. It is an eminantly replayable disc, and I find myself dusting it off the shelf once or twice a year, and being glad I own it."
5,Buy it!,"I saw Bonepony live in 1994 or 1995, and still remember the show fondly. They played all their own songs and yet I was drawn into the music the way I would be if I were listening to a well-known group play songs I'd known and loved for years. The other day, the group came to mind, and I decided to look for a CD. It's better than I remembered. This is just a 3-person band, but the music has plenty of intricacy; a really ""full"" sound. As for describing the style, the title ""Stomp Revival"" sums it up. You'd have to be dead to resist the urge to stomp your feet to this one!"
4,Decent little fan,"Got this for my cubicle. On low setting it's just the right amount of air movement and its definitely the right size.It's a lot louder than I expected, but fortunately my work has computers everywhere, people discussing things all over, and general hum of noise to make it acceptable.I would probably not want to use this in a more quiet environment."
4,A good source for alternatives.,"Yessss. This book is a concise guide for those of you who are exploring alternatives before you commit to a prescription anti-depressant. Believe me, once you are on them, it is very difficult to convince your doctor to wean you from them so that you can try an alternative, natural supplement. I urge all people to explore SAMe or 5-HTP along with KavaKava before resorting to prescirption medicines if you are suffering from mild, periodic depression. I have found the best deals for my SAMe from a site called iHerb. I take SAMe and their powdered Kava and am feeling much better. I also feel like I have control of my own health."
4,getting your feet wet,"For those who do not know much about serotonin this is a great book. My biggest problem with it is that it sites its sources too frequently which makes for long unclear runon sentencens much like the one you are reading right now.Other than that, this book is great. If you change your diet or learn another way to elevate your serotonin levels naturally you may save yourself some of the despair caused by popular SSRIs such as Zoloft or Paxil. Search the web for feedback on either drug and you will see what I mean.How much is your sanity worth? $4 - probably a little more!"
5,IF YOU DON'T OWN THIS ALBUM...>YOU DON'T KNOW HIP HOP!,"This album is by far the best hip hop album ever produced. If you don't own it, you really don't know real hip hop. Large Prof. is a genius because all these tracks are bangin'. The lyrics are on-point and new players in the game need to take note of this album if they think they can be in the game. Too often I hear contemporary hip-hop sounding like total crap,,,why...because it is! Where are the lyricists today? A&R folks at major labels need to shoot themselves because they are producing junk. Back in the day people had talent. Take note of Main Source if you think you know anything about hip-hop. Take it from an old-school G, this is classic. You better recognize! Peace, unity, love and havin' fun. BA"
5,Masterful Entertainment,"This is the fourth installment in the Harry Bosch series, and overall it was excellent. Fast paced, action packed, a terrific thriller. Harry still has S#@t for taste in woman, but that is actually par for the course in this genre. But, overall, this is a great story."
5,Good read,"I was really into this book because it gives the readers a chance to look into Harry Bosch's past a little further. With him investigating his mothers murder, I was cheering him along the whole way. And in classic Connelly style, there are many twists, turns and surprises."
4,Harry Bosch at his best,"I really enjoyed this book! I began my Michael Connelly journey with Concrete Blond, then Blood Work, then Trunk Music. Then I decided to start at the beginning. This book is one of my favorite Connelly books! I really like Harry, and ""feel his pain."" I'm about to read The Poet, which I understand is not a Harry Bosch book. But, neither was Blood Work, and I enjoyed it very much. After The Poet, I guess I'll have to wait for his next novel. Hope it's soon!!"
3,Great Character Development for Bosch,This book helps further build Bosch as a character as his investigation of his mother's murder shows where he came from before departing for Vietnam. It is one of Connelly's best books in the series.
5,Best Bosch of all,"I just re-read this book for the second time -- something I rarely do -- and still think it is Connelly's master work. I won't rehash the plot --that's been done -- but will only say that both readers of suspense and fiction in general will find much to love in this book. For regular readers of Connelly, in this book you finally begin to really ""get"" LAPD detective Heironymous Bosch. Connelly is a gifted writer who draws a very human portrait of the ultimate tortured hero, the ultimate man of principle, and just writes a darn good tale. Loved, too, all the secondary characters, especially the psychologist, and enjoyed the historical backdrop of the earthquake. And as usual, the end has quite a twist so if you think you've got this one figured out . . . maybe not."
3,me too,"The Last Coyote is a book worth reading. It has the required characters (the Kindle search feature is great when you come across a name you can't remember well), and the twists and turns to keep you guessing. I could identify with Harry Bosch and the coyote angle. And as usual, a twist at the end that catches you by surprise."
3,Disappointed,Enjoyed reading but was disappointed. After reading Lincoln Lawyer and Reversal this book lacked in suspense and was slow paced. I really had to push myself to continue. Not finished yet.
4,entertaining Bosch,"This is another good read with Harry Bosch as the talented but troubled LA detective. It has been two or three years since I last read one of this series and I had a nagging feeling that I had read this one before. It turns out that I hadn't but it also demonstrates that the main character has rather predictable plots. Still, I was entertained and the story filled in some of the Bosch's past."
4,interesting,"A lot of action and depth with many twists and turns. A very active cop for an ""off duty"" officer with suprising sentimental insight."
5,Good cop reading,A down to earth cop with real people problems. Excellent reading. Will be looking for more to be coming out.
4,the last coyote,This was the first Harry Bosch book I had read. I enjoyed the book and couldn't put it down. I have already purchased my second Harry Bosch book and can't wait to get started.
4,enjoyed The Last Coyote,Enjoyed the book because it had different layers to the story. I like running themes in books where i can become invested in the character so this qualifies plus it goes through emotions and thoughts not just murder and solving the case. Second one i've read. will read more.
5,the last coyote,"I look forward to the ""Harry Bosch"" new releases and in fact go back and re-read the earlier books from my library. The Kindle makes it so much easier and convenient. If ever a serious crime were committed against me or a family member I would hope it was an officer like Harry Bosch that was assigned the investigative responsibility. His tenacity in seeking out criminal enterprise should represent an example for police to follow."
4,Continuing Saga of Harry Bosch,"The saga of Harry continues with the somehat predictable set of plot twists, confrontations, deceptions and romantic incidents in this novel. Harry's character evloves somewhat, though not in any really unexpected fashion. Some of the twists were funny, others somewhat sad. Overall, a quick and plesant read."
4,Kindle Edition,"We are in the middle of reading it and so far it is quite good. It's keeping our attention at the moment, as looking forward to the end."
4,Love me some Harry Bosch!,perfect way to curl up on a cold winter eveningreading my favorite dectective! No one does itbetter than Connelly.
5,Another great yarn from Connelly,"I always wonder how one writer can keep cranking out so many books and still maintain the quality, but Connelly does it. I won't go into any of the plot if you've never read any of his books, start if you have you will enjoy this one also."
4,Clever Story Line,"In this one, Harry (being Harry), gets himself into one mess after another and one pull of the plot is to see how he is going to clear his name. I think Trunk Music was a little better, but this one has a lot to recommend it. Vivid characters, clever story line, and plenty of action. A fast easy read. Michael Connelly always leaves you wanting more."
4,Very good book - ending a bit weak,"Again an absolute must for mystery readers. Bosch is digging in his past, in his roots. What he finds is depressing, but it helps him too. It is a novel full of tension. But the ending is not so good. A man like Harry Bosch should be able to cope with what he found. He is not someone who cracks too easily. Or does Michael Connelly want to forget him?"
1,Kind of boring,"This book is not fast paced at all. I found it very boring. I don't understand the hype. I was able to predict the ""Twist"" ending half way through the book."
3,Last Coyote,"I read the Lincoln Lawyer and then Firth Witness, and thoroughly enjoyed both books. They certainly were page-turners. So, I figured I'd invest 8 bucks in the Bosch character. Unfortunately, the book doesn't ""grip you by the throat"" in the first few chapters to encourage you to continue reading. It was slow and full of details that didn't do much to support the story. Checking my Kindle often it wasn't until I was well into 30% of the book before it became a good read. I enjoyed the last 65% of the book."
5,The Fox,"Harry is a damaged hero, yet we all identify with him and want to see him come out on top. This book gives additional insights into why Harry behaves the way he does and why basically he is driven by a desire to see the bad-guys get their just deserts. The book is well written and has some surprising twists and turns and will keep the reader interested till the very last word."
4,Loving to read,Enjoyed this Bosch book but I do feel it was a little drug out---especially toward the end. But then I was also sorry to see it end because I become friends with the characters in the books. Thank you for a good story.
5,Great Book,"If you like a good mystery, this book is for you. It holds your interest from start to finish, I had a hard time putting it down"
4,Good Mystery,This was a well written book that presented the characters in detail. The plot was twisting and turning so that you had to keep reading to see where you were going next. There was enough action as well as exporation of the characters.
5,The Last Coyote,"Michael Connelly spins a fabulous story. The Harry Bosch series is always dark but the characters and plots make them sing. If ""brain candy"" is your meat, this is the thinking man's brain candy. I hate reviews that give away anything of the plot so, suffice it to say, there are plenty of ""oh wows"" here for any reader. Keep this guy in print!"
3,Good........... but definitely not his best,"This is a nice book but the end of this novel leaves you wondering. My precise point is that the ending doesn't make a whole lotta sense. Sure, he finds the perp, but it doesn't explain the other peoples intentions or actions which actually cause the perp to kill. I just didn't think that it added up.On the other hand, the book was well written and a fun read. But one couldn't compare it to The Black Echo or The Concrete Blonde."
4,Last Coyote,"Another great book of Michael Connelly, in keeping with is other books - it is great reading, any fan of MC would appreciate this one too. You will not be disappointed."
3,Good writing for this genre,"Connelly is a very talented writer. This is a good story, and the ending was a surprise. I gave it only three stars because it would have been better without the gratuitous sex scene."
3,"good, not great","This is a good Bosch book, but not a great one. Their is too much exploration of Bosch's personal life. To long and not enough story. Would not be a good book to start on Connelly. Try Blood Work or Concrete Blond."
1,"the last coyote , by tesi",The Last coyote (Harry Bosch) was a very excellent read. I would advise anyone who is interested in adventure and suspense to read this book. I liked this book.
1,Cop w/BIG personal problems solves mother's 30 yr old murder,"Another Harry Bosch mystery. All of the plot twists and Harry's ongoing angst about himself, his life, his view of the world. He trolls through the nasty underside of politics and police work, digging to find the killer of his mother - 30 years ago when he was 12. Best line: he finds the cop who informed him that his mother was dead. The cop thinks that Harry's after him about the loose ends on the incident and has a gun on Harry. Harry tells the cop how he found Harry at a swimming pool to tell him. The cop says ""you're the kid"" and Harry answers ""I'm the kid"". (I love scenes that echo something that happened years before). Anyway, a very good read, and several sets of false clues, just to keep you guessing."
4,Get to know Harry Bosch,"If you want to know Harry Bosch a whole lot better, you must read this book. He investigates the death of his own mother, confronting old memories and dealing with the past. A must-read."
5,Great Harry Bosch book,I was very happy with this product. It was shipped promptly and in great condition. Another good book in the Harry Bosch series.
4,A cold case,"Harry Bosch is on administrative leave after assaulting a police supervisor. Trying to cope with the underlying cause of his anger, he is drawn into a cold case - the unsolved murder of his mother about 30 years previously. There are people who want the case to stay cold. Powerful people have an interest, and there are political considerations. A high placed political fixer is involved. Harry finds additional details from his mother's past.Like most good mysteries, there are a couple surprising twists. There is a digression into Harry's new love life, and a side issue about his earthquake damaged house.Readers who like this novel might also like Executive Privilege by Philip Margolin."
3,Last Coyote,"Author takes along time to get to the message.Bosch, the main character, is not likeable at all, notwithstanding his childhood baggage. Does not encourage me to finish the book....but I will."
4,Another great Connelly thriller,"The Last Coyote is more focused on Bosch' mental health than the previous novels. He spends quite a bit of time on the psychiatrist's ""couch"". The reader learns more about him and yet it slows down the action some. However the thriller is a good one. Bosch investigates the murder of his own mother and uncovers many nasty connections he is eager to expose. There is a minor romantic interest that seems contrived but overall this is a fine thriller."
3,The Last,Was slightly disappointed but read it through. Will also read another in the futrue and judge whether to buy the next book
4,the last coyote,"This was a typical connelly tale , told in his usual well thought out manner. inspector Bosch will I am sure continue for some time yet!!! A good read !!!"
4,Typical Connelly,Good compicated plot. Character development well executed. Just what I expect from Michael Connelly. The Bosch character continues with increased depth into his personality.
4,last coyote,a well written book full of twists ant turns good reading full of suspense and set in a very life like setting
3,Is Fine ...but consider DIY,"Although there is nothing wrong with the product, I thought I'd just write a few words about it. Prior to purchase I'd looked at some of the youtube's about creating your own version. I was a little disappointed by the plastic hands - which were not covered with anything - so just a piece of pvc pipe. In other words, you could build one yourself- just as nice. Even a cheap carry bag would have been nice and made it worth the price. Now in fairness - the included DVD video was certainly worth something - it was informative. Note: as another reviewer mentions - it only shows exercises from overhead bar, hence some will not be possible from a door. Also, I'm glad I didn't spend 3 times as much for the Jungle Gym XT. I'll make my own version of that."
5,lifeline jungle gym,I like it quite a bit. I use it in my basement over a beam. Great body weight workout for the back. I also do body weight flyes with it as well (push up position then arms out laterally and back up). Really seems to work the stabilization muscles quite nicely. Dips take on a whole new challenge when you have to control your movement. Overall the workout is similar to gymnastic training for the rings.
4,Excellent for on the road-hotel room workouts,"While it is not very sophisticated, one can use the enclosed tube and attach it to a door,and very difficult pullups are possible. The angles available for pushups are limited howeverone can't go wrong with the price, considering others can be over $200."
4,This is a great product and good for traveling,I really enjoy this product and it's easy to travel with. I can make my exercises as easy or as hard as I want to.
4,jungle jim greatest idea!,Yes a jungle and bungle workout!Your in the jungle now! I would love to connect with some vines like tarzan! well this can be equipment that is alright by me!
4,jungle gym workout,This product is great. I have already started seeing results from working out with this easy and convenient product.
4,Good Value and Gets the Job Done!,"I was introduced to suspension training at my gym where I used a more expensive brand. I liked the concept and the portability of this type of workout system. Having researched the reviews at Amazon, I learned about the Jungle Gym and decided, for the price - almost 2/3's less than the other brand, I couldn't go wrong if I didn't like it or I wasn't motivated to go it alone at home. Well, I was quite satisfied with the value. It's very basic - straps, handles and buckles but...it gets the job done! The buckles are easy to use making the strap lengths easy to adjust. I also watched some of the YouTube video's to get more exercise ideas. I am quite satisfied and will bring it with me when I travel. (It would have been nice if it had come with a stuff bag to store it but that's easy enough to buy.)"
4,Brings memories,"This is a great collection of 80s New Wave music. If you want to get some of the best-known music of that type from that era, this really hits the mark. The remastered sound on these Gold-series packages is top-shelf too. Highly recommended."
1,"""Double Head Torque Wrench""","I did my research before ordering. Even checked the manufacturer's website. Things looked fine, this product should have been a ""1/2"" Drive Torque Wrench with 3/8"" Adapter"".I received a ""Double Head Torque Wrench"". Still model number TQ150, still UPC 76812010643... The manufacturer decided to change the product without changing its moder number nor its UPC. They are now to ""incorporating"" the 3/8 inch head into the wrench instead of attaching the separate adapter. The problem is that the torque wrench is unusable with its 3/8 inch head, as the scale is facing away from the user."
4,Does what you want it to without getting out of adjustment,"One of the issues I have with ""click"" type torque wrenches is that they get out of adjustment-- sometimes so wildly that you could shear off a lug nut or have something even worse... under-tightened. While you do have to be a little careful with the reading collar as not to scratch the vehicle for vehicles with really flared fenders, the unit I've had for several years has been very reliable & durable."
3,Not for LG PM-325,"It's my fault for trying to get a charger for cheap. I bought this charger because I knew the plug fit, and figured that it would work. Not sure if the PM-325 requires more juice than the other phones this charger compatibility lists, but when I plug this into my phone, the phone charges for about 10 seconds, then turns green like it's fully charged. Unplug it, it hasn't charged at all. I'll give it a fair review, I don't know if it has problems with the models listed. Just a warning to others looking for a cheap charger for PM-325."
4,Under Armor Rocks,"The polo was for my dad, who has never tried an under armor product before. He's a avid golfer, and he was very happy with the shirt. Thanks."
5,Excellent Purchase,"I work all over the place, I am always on the go. I may be in an office or on the roof top of a high rise. The shirt fits perfect and feels great. I wear them mostly because they are breathable and keep me cool in the Texas Summer heat but also because they are business casual. I would and have recommended this brand to anyone. Shipping was fast, before the estimated delivery."
4,Watch the shipping!,Great shirt and helps with bearing the desert heat easier. Keeps it's color and shape well so you don't have that wrinkled/rumpled look after washings or packing in a travel bag.Decent price about 10% below other sellers but order more than one shirt from this place to prevent the $25.00 shipping fee from stinging!You would think the vendor would offer lower shipping rates for servicemembers in APO/FPO areas but not in this case.
3,Be sure you order the right size or you will be disappointed!,The product is awesome! I just ordered the wrong size and now have to re-order and then I will be extremely pleased so check with me again!!
4,Its a black polo.,"UA black polo, love the material, quick to dry, easy to wash, very comfortable to wear. I wear this as part of my work uniform and even out and about!"
5,Outstanding,Outstanding shirt love the color and the fit. Played golf in it the other day and felt great the material kept me cool.
4,Great shoe for the price,"I have been wearing generic (slides on both shoes for left or right hand bowlers)lately. This is my first right hand only shoes. The shoes fit good, seem true to size. A little stiff at first but after the first few frames you forget they are on. Good quality."
5,Great beginners' book,"I was hesitant to buy this after reading the other reviews. Now I have it, and I honestly don't know what the other reviewers are talking about. I ordered four dual-language books at once, and this was by far the best and most accessible for beginners. After only a week of German study, I can easily make it through (with some reference to the parallel text) the first 8-10 stories and poems, and they gradually increase in difficulty so that I'll be able to comfortably read more as my German improves. The selections are cute and interesting, and most are by famous German authors and poets, so you get exposure to real German literature as you develop your language skills."
2,First German Reader,"As a First Reader, the content is somewhat challenging. It is comparable in content and vocabulary to literature text for 8th or 9th grade classes in most US schools. There is also no progressing order of difficulty so that you need to search for readings that you can master. It is however well translated and there is a great variety of reading selections within the book for a wide range of language skill and vocabulary levels. So, for those looking for a true First level reader, I would not recommend this book; a Second - yes."
2,Not a beginner's book!,"Although there does appear to be a concise accompanying translation of each item, I would not call this a ""beginners"" book. The text and language is for the most part esoteric and complicated making translations of little value to the beginner reader. A beginners book is one tht begins with simple langage and concepts and slowly grows in complixity, terminology, tenses, and cases. Such is defintely not the case here. But if you like German literature and/or are at a more advanced stage in your study, then its okay."
4,This book is not for beginners.,"I actually do like this book, but I would not recommend it to a beginner."
2,Shipped fast Lap top had to change 'modes' to Australian,This is the Australian version. Worked fine. Lap top had to change which it is only able to do a few times.
4,Compares nicely to Prefuse Releases,"The experimental jazz of an admitted hiphop fiend. People who like ambient electronic, jazz and hip-hop should check it out. This album contains many bits and pieces of songs found on Herren's other releases as Savath+Savalas and as Delarosa+Asora. Savath and ""Folk Songs"" in particular are a pleasant surprise in that Herren's already organic approach to beat construction meets live instrumentation, resulting in a relaxing but certainly not boring listening experience. However, this kind of music is not for everyone. If you get bored listening to Brian Eno or Cannonball Adderly, this isn't for you."
5,"Savath & Savalas - Folk Songs For Trains, Trees And Honey","Scott Herren goes from cut-up hip-hop with his Prefuse 73 project to a more ambient, downtempo vibe as Savath & Savalas. And while one in not necessarily better than the other, Savath + Savalas' debut, FOLK SONGS FOR TRAINS, TREES AND HONEY, has a mesmerizing beauty that's sustained throughout. The quiet tones and repeating patterns of ""Transportation Theme"" are like watching clouds in the sky. Fragments of jazz woodwinds and guitar, backed with radio static, drift through on ""Binoculars."" The meandering stop-start of ""F Ride + Blues"" benefits greatly by having its mellow drums punctuate each interruption, even as static fills in the backdrop. ""Journey's Home"" has a folksy twang to it that seems perfectly suited for a postmodern Western. A moody, atmospheric album."
3,enh,"Maybe it just hasn't grown on me yet, but I echo the sentiments of the first reviewer: mediocre with a few good tracks. It's different, and different is good, but I'm just not sure this thing goes anywhere well enough in 9 tracks to warrant picking it up unless you heard someone else's and were hooked. There's a lot of pretty uninteresting filler... ambience... used to tie the tracks together. It annoyed me more than it helped hold the CD together."
5,Excellent!,"This is wonderful stuff! I've got their Balkan Beat Box, too - but I think I prefer this one only because the former has more electronics and dance length songs... All tracks on this one are more ""song-y"" if that makes any sense."
4,No complaints,CD was in perfect condition. Took a little longer to arrive than I'd expected but this may not be the fault of the vendor.
2,"Good, except for secured wireless LANs","I have been using this device for about an year now. It was cheap and I ordered it while I was buying some other stuff.The only problem I found with this (which I consider a major problem) is that if I enable wireless LAN security, the wireless network stops time to time (several times a day). Only after a full reboot (switch off/switch on) of this device the wireless network starts to work again.Annoying!"
3,just a bad choice of the lead actor,"I found myself wondering how they found out all this about himand they never used any of the later music.Some of this music I had never heard.The accent used by the lead actor was just not authentic enough for meand he seemed to not really be feeling the emotionsand connecting with what was happening?It seems bad enough that he was assassinatedwithout them re-assassinating him on film like this?For real poetry to have weight, it must be rooted in angstand this movie sure gives that.I think his two ""Mothers"" carried the movie."
3,It was ok,"I liked In His Life: The John Lennon Story and Backbeat a lot better. This seemed to be exactly like In His Life: The John Lennon Story except in this movie none of the actors looked remotely close to the people they were portraying, and events that happened in this movie were mostly the same, except the details were different than those in In His Life (for example compare the two scenes when John is choosing between his mother and father). I was also wondering after watching this how come there wasn't much mention of John at art school and Stuart Sutcliffe?"
4,Beatles Fan? Watch This Film,"You've read many comments by now. Simply stated: We all know snippets about John's childhood; this film gathers them up and puts them in a visual package for you with the help of some very good actors. Is every word and action exactly as it happened? Likely not...and even if John was alive to provide information for the story...it would likely not all be true. (Hey...it's Lennon we're writing about here)So watch it, enjoy it and don't get hung up on the details."
3,"I wanted to love it, but could not","I love all things Beatles. I was in front of my family's black and white television when they charmed the states on Ed Sullivan. I've read many books, seen many documentaries and movies. Some were horrid, some were quite good. I suppose the problem is there really is nothing left to say that's new about the Beatles.This movie is fairly good, somewhat accurate and the acting overall was first rate {particularly Kristin Scott-Thomas}. I can't say it's any better or more entertaining then others I have seen. This movie is just a re-hashing of what has gone before. As a Beatles fan I have found the best to be ""Anthology"" and Cynthia Lennon's book ""John"" to be the most entertaining and informative."
2,No Doubting the Talent,"Though one has to wonder about the sanity of anyone that questions the incredible songwriting talent of the Lennon-McCartney matchup, perhaps without doubt the greatest songwriters of our time.One also would probably have to look long and hard for a non ""angst"" filled person raised during war wracked Great Britain. The question being would similar talents have evolved if not effected by the (to Americans), trauma of growing up during the ""blitz""?There were many people who lived in much worse conditions than the now sainted John Lennon. I've seen images of ""East Enders"" of London scrambling through bomb craters looking for something, anything to suppliment their ration cards.....many children just mastering walking.Is there anything worthwhile to this movie? Well, it employed some people during bleak financial times....other than that? I don't see it."
2,Awful...,There are so many inaccuracies in this movie it's ridiculous. I saw it early last year and spent most of it wanting to throw something at the screen. Save your money...
1,One of the worst movies I ever saw.,"I am a huge John Lennon fan and was so looking forward to the release of this movie. From everything I know about John for the last 35 years, I'm not sure if this movie was even about John's early life. The actor that played Paul made him look like he was 10 years old. It was just terrible. It was just a bad movie all around."
5,Good stuff!,"Considering this was shipped all the way from Canada in little than a week and a half, I'm pretty impressed with not only the quick delivery but also the quality of the movie. This was such a good movie, and really one I can recommend to anyone. Loved it!"
4,Excellent biographical movie,"Non-fiction movies and biographical movies are not easy to do, but Sam Taylor Wood manages to hit the nail on the head with this sad tale of a young Liverpudlian whose dream to create a rock-and-roll group came true, and then some. This movie is not about The Beatles, so don't pick it up if you're looking for that story (go with A Hard Days Night or better yet, Beatles Anthology) but rather about the mixed-up childhood of John Lennon, a man revered for his peace and good nature and unfortunate death. Nowhere Boy captures the rebellious pre-teen and teenager who looked for acceptance, clung to his closest friends and experienced loss that's too hard to capture with words. Aaron Johnson plays a dead-on young Lennon, and one has to wonder -- what would Lennon think of this movie about his life? Would there even be one if he was still with us? Great movie, well-acted. Aunt Mimi (played by Kristen Scott-Thomas) steals the show as the stern but adoring aunt who raised John."
5,Great movie! Helps one to better understand the early life of John Lennon,I thought this was a great movie...it helped me to better understand the early life of John Lennon and what he went through in order to become successful. There were several parts of the movie where I bawled my eyes out. This movie left me with a soft spot in my heart for John Lennon.
2,Movie,"This movie wasn't quite what we had in mind. It wasn't very appropriate for our teenager who really likes the Beatles. It wasn't rated so we hoped it would be good, but it wasn't."
1,"Stay away from the inetvideo version of ""Nowhere Boy""!","inetvideo is peddling a canadian version release of this title that is badly gimped. It is NOT the proper Sony release of this title. In order to cram the title onto single layer media, this particular disc does not include the supplements listed on Amazon, nor does it even include subtitles of any type. AVOID this product from inetvideo!"
4,Outstanding,"Somewhat obselete now, but certainly an epic book when it was written. I can see elements of LBR, Victoria Pearson and Joe Ross from this book and it's fairly obvious they were influenced from it. Lots of very basic, logical price action and even the most experienced trader can pick up a few things here and there."
1,Need's a lot of improvement!!!,"My name is Michael J. Trohimczyk, an Adjunct Faculty member at Henry Ford Community College. I have taught computer's at the college level for the past 9 years & used this text last year. I ran into several computer problems, i.e. journal entries would be posted but would not show up as expected. Also, my student's told me on several occasion's that the appendix's were confusing. I revised my entire course syllabus this term to resolve these challenges. Although I revised my syllabus, I now have 80% of my student's with either a BAD DATA DISK OR PROGRAM DISK. The software has too many restriction's that CANNOT be overridden. I am spending at least one hour a day extra helping my student's because of computer software problems. Unless there is a major revision in this edition, I am NOT planning on using this text for future courses"
1,BAD for your eyes.,My eyes were tired after trying to read this book for only a few minutes. Ms. Danana must have thought that the absence of pictures could be compensated for by printing her confusing book on what she probably thought was atmospheric stock. The grey on grey mottled paper was aggrivating. and headache inducing. Don't waste your money!

5,Highly Recommend +++,"On for ~ three months. These lights are perfect for my '09 Toyota Tacoma mounted on a Grille Guard aimed at high beam height at the sides of the road. I do not off-road so they are used to watch for wildlife on the sides of the roads/highways in Montana. Very nice looking, bright, great distance, excellent light pattern for me, VERY EASY TO INSTALL (excellent instructions, unlike Hella). The only thing to be aware of is the interchangable lenses are not snap-on, you must choose the lens you desire and screw it on in place of any other; not a problem for me to leave it on clear. Chipping could be a problem as there is no surface protection (most lights have a plastic grill which would likely crack anyway if hit by gravel) and I live in a gravel road area with sanded/graveled winter roads, but I plan on using the 3-M protection film, as I do on all of my lights. I would classify these as driving lights for roads, not off-road lights. Highly recommend."
4,Very bright lights for the size,I bought these for my hood light bracket on my Jeep. They were easy to install with the instructions provided and are very bright. Great for off and on road driving conditions. The lights get very hot and I had trouble aiming them because I burned myself on the cases after they had been only only a couple of minutes. The cover on one melted as I was aligning the other one. Overall very satified with the product.
2,light covers were not the type that was shown,"Lights work great but the covers that came with the kit were not the ones that were shown in the picture of the product--which is why i oredered this kit,now i have to order the ones i want to match my other lights at 18 bucks for a single cover."
4,100 mostly great stories,"As in most anthologies, not every story was a winner, but some were excellent. I found that some of them were more like a long joke ending with a punchline than a story. Great if you don't have long blocks of time to devote to reading."
1,"dry and old,","Dry and old tasting. Only sent 4 VERY SMALL pastries. Charged as much for s/h as the item cost, a TOTAL RIP OFF"
4,Gladesmen review,"A close friend and Capt. that grew up in this area recommended this book to me and being a dedicated sportsman and from florida I thought it would be a very interesting read as I can relate to the author and his experiences. I have done many of the same things myself. If you are interested in early Florida life and hunting and fishing I would expect you would enjoy and appreciate the book. This is basically a book on what early life was like in and around the everglades, hunting and fishing to survive and the adversities that the people of the area had to endure.Larry S.If your are interested in the outdoors in Florida You might be interedted in my blogs, [...]"
5,Korkoro (2011) Tony Gatlif Film,"I really enjoy Tony Gatlif's films. His films are inspiring for the open minded vagabond at heart.I love that music is a part of his films. From Mondo, Transalvania, Vengo, Swing, Gadjo Dilo, Exiles, Latcho Drom.Viva Los Gitanos!!!!"
5,'Korkoro',"I briefly heard about the Romany Gypsies while at university. I was fascinated. I was watching it on TV recently and only caught half of it that is why I ordered it. For me the movie was quite Anthropological as I felt it captured the raw and free spirit of the Romany Gypsies, and how horrific it must have been to be captured, imprisoned not knowing what was happening, treated badly and then shot or gassed to death within Hitlers extermination of human beings who did not fit with his idea of a pure german race. The Romany Gypsies lust for life, their unique music and dance, and ways of being in the world was awesome to observe especially their children. Another little known tragedy of the Hitler regime that would be valuable within High School History Education. And similarities for me to Indigenous people's experiences of invasion and colonisation."
1,heat-wrenching polarity of mind-sets,I found the nose-dive from freedom loving colourfull original people to nazi-ism too extreme to stomach.There is much more footage of real gypsies in The Crazy Stranger by the same director gypsy-born himself.A delight to hit pause on the remote for the photogenic stills of costume and spirited faces etc.... since few actors here.I wish the Jews in the movie buisness would ease off making films on the holocaust since it is far from the amount of viscious genocides in history. They say its worse because it was systematic but so was the boats of grain being sent to England during the Irish famine.That said nothing compares to Shoa. However the film fills a void in remembrance of the under-documented gypsiy minority in holocaust history.
2,only the singles go,"Only the singles are tracks with vocals here. The singles like Turn Around and Feel Good were quite nice, but the instrumental tracks are not as strong unfortunately"
2,Tastes fine but stay close to a bathroom,"I've purchased and tried a lot of protein powders over the years. This past year, I've been trying to educate myself more on the ingredients and purchasing only those protein powders/shakes that are closer to being ""all-natural"". I thought the Jay Robb product was a winner. I purchased the vanilla whey protein, mixed it with skim milk and a scoop of peanut butter. It tasted fine but man it was death to my stomach. I thought perhaps it was something else that I ate and stuck with it for the next few days varying my diet but to no avail, the bathroom issues kept reoccurring. So I stopped the protein powdeer and went to the Jay Robb protein bars and same result. When I stopped eating all of Jay Robb's products, bathroom issues cleared up. Coincidence??? I was also a bit disappointed when I opened the container and only half of it was filled with powder. Not cool."
5,great product overall.,"It contains no artificial sweetners,it comes from hormone-free cows and it taste great....enough said. They could however try lowering their price a little."
2,Awful aftertaste,"I know taste is subjective. What tastes terrible to me might be great to you. But I found this shake to have a terrible aftertaste that I've never experienced with any other protein powder I've used during the six or eight years I've used protein powders.I know it is supposed to be made of high quality ingredients. I don't know how much arsenic and other heavy metal might be in it as it was not one tested by Consumer Reports. Moreover, there is (as of this writing) nothing on their site about it and they don't seem to have a contact number readily available.- Susanna K. Hutcheson"
4,Useful resource for the budding illustrator...,"As my fellow reviewer mentioned, the title of this book is a bit misleading (albeit unintentionally misleading). However, the book can still be an invaluable resource for those interested in woking in the picture book field.While not a guidebook or ""how to"" manual, ""Children's Book Illustration & Design II"" does give an informative overview of various styles established illustrators have used with their children's book projects. As such, the book can be a useful tool for the novice commercial/picture book illustrator who may need inspiration when faced with a particular assignment.Like a set of picture files on various topics, books such as this one are very handy to have in the artist's studio."
3,Difficult but great,"The play is written in old English with a very rich and entertaining language. Basically it was quite terrible to read because of this old fashioned English, but the story is pretty obvious and easy to understand. The story is very thrilling because you never know if he really does the murder of the king or not. But then finally, he sees his chance and executes Duncan to get king himself. It is very interesting because there are a lot of murders and intrigues. By the way, there's a very good film by Roman Polanski"
4,Easy Shakespeare,"This is the easiest way to read Shakespeare. One side is ""The Bard's"" words and the other is modern English. I highly recommend if reading Shakespeare is like reading another language."
2,Didn't like it at all,"Shakespeare is certainly considered to be one of the greatest authors of all times, but I don't really know why. Maybe I haven't understood the whole meaning of the play; to me it seemed quite boring and too predictable. It's a story about power and abusing power, about traitors and morality, decorated with many complicated sentences and words."
3,"Bad story, but......","'Macbeth' is a bad story, but is has one of the greatest passages in English literature history. The speech Macbeth gives at the end is simply mindblowing. It is the only reason why the play deserves 3 stars."
5,Shakespeare at his best,"I've read several of Shakespeare's plays now, and I can honestly say that this is one of my favorites. Its a really enjoyable, dark, bloody, play. Shakespeare combines many elements in this play: the supernatural, corruption, political ambition, and revenge. Themes that we can still relate to today. Although the language is often difficult in MacBeth, don't let that discourage you. Keep trying! Read a page twice if you need to, but read it. If you give it an honest chance, you wont be disappointed."
4,Macbeth: Stupidity and Fall of a Hero,"Power corrupts. Macbeth is a tragedy that portrays the role of morals and values and the quest for power of a valiant solider. The play begins with Macbeth as a noble warrior who, by the end of the play, through paranoia and a hunger for power, turns into a bloodthirsty murderer.Shakespeare shows some of his finest qualities of writing in the tragedy of Macbeth. The language does pose a problem, but as the play progresses the style of writing becomes less challenging. Many of the characters die before ever developing, yet Shakespeare includes an abundance of characters, sometimes making it difficult to keep track of all of them. Shakespeare once again incorporates a supernatural element into his play, characterized by the three witches adding suspense to the story.I would recommend Macbeth to any reader who is willing to take on the challenge of Shakespearean language and style."
5,The best,"This is the best of the Macbeth audio recordings that I've ever heard. Since I teach this play twice a year for the past twenty years, I've had the opportunity to pretty much hear them all, and I don't think any of the others compare. In fact, all of the Caedmon audio Shakespeare series are excellent, even the more obscure plays. (You should listen to the Caedmon recording of Coriolanus with Richard Burton, Jessica Tandy and Michael Hordern!) If you're looking for an audio Macbeth, this is the one."
2,Plain,"There's no footnotes, which make it difficult to use. Overall, it's worth the extra bucks to buy a more helpful reading guide."
3,just like the description... nothing extra,"I bought this because I needed a copy on my kindle for my class. If you want just that, this will satisfy you. Not much typos or distracting formatting. I didn't think it was a waste of my money.Nothing extra though:character listnumbered linesnotesetc..."
2,"Interesting, but ultimately flawed","Having researched great authors as part my PhD at Princeton, it is surprising how poorly Shakespeare has written this particular book. The plot is weak and lacks imagination, the character development is all over the shop and writing style is quite muddled in places. Interesting read though!"
2,Not my favorite Shakespeare...,"I am a fan of Shakespeare, and I have a lot more reading to do until I've completed all his works. However, I have to say out of the plays I have read, Macbeth is one of my least favorite. I feel like you know almost everything that is going to happen after the three witches appear. I understand the themes, but sometimes I feel like they are so blatant, and hardly masked by the characters and the rest of the story. I think people should read Macbeth, but I don't think it's his best work."
1,False Advertising!,I was looking for one with helps and such and this one I recieved did not have ANYTHING besides the text!
1,HR dept. brilliance,Be sure to set c-phone to vibrate or off. Forgot and left it on. Some brilliant (dumb) Ace in marketing sends e-mails at 2:15 A.M. Would have been better to just get a $2.00 paperback.
2,below my expectation,"not thhe book i expected to receive, took too long to get. within allotted time but not the service i've come to expect from amazon. i order several books a month, not impressed with this seller."
1,Had to read this for class,"I had to read this for class and I hated it so much I ended up reading the synopsis and got an ""A"" on my review. Shakespeare's style of writing is not what I would call an easy read. He uses unnecessary(sp) words and when you are trying to get a story read for a homework, that last thing I need is to read a confusing play that I don't understand. The premise of the story is entertaining so I would suggest reading a summary of the play."
2,"I generally like Shakespeare, but...","I generally like Shakespeare. In fact, I can't think of one play that I did not like before I read this one. Macbeth I found to be tacky with very few memorable quotes."
1,New Folger Library Shakespeare -- Not Recommended,"These editions of Shakespeare by New Folger Library are absolutely awful. They dumb down the Bard, as if people couldn't possibly understand Shakespeare unless they have plot summations. Frankly, they disgust me. I'm not saying Shakespeare's a breeze, but to read him in this watered down format is a travesty."
1,"Great literature, awful formatting","This book is formatted terribly for the kindle, all of the text is munged together as one huge block. Basically unreadable."
4,Fabulous,This is a fabulous reading of MacBeth by Alan Cumming. I very much enjoyed listening to Alan's performance. A very nice way to spend two hours.
5,Great for listening in the car!,"As a homeschooled family, this was perfect to squeeze in a little more education out of long, boring car rides. The accents were wonderful! The sound effects were very believable. After a crack of lightening on the CD, several of us jumped and looked to the sky."
5,life saver!,i really needed this for my english class and i did not know where else to find it. i bought a new one and im glad they had a book for me.
5,Great Macbeth!,"This CD is excellent--the witches are super creepy sounding, and the unabridged text is well performed. Definitely helpful for teaching Macbeth."
5,very helpful,The translation is clear and it helps immensely that it is side by side with the actual text. That way it's easy to fully understand the meaning behing Shakespeare's language.
4,Macbeth,I want to understand the story of Macbeth. I also Want to learn about the story of Macbeth. Where can i go into the internet to search for the story of Macbeth.
2,Macbeth,"Confusing and boring. Plays SUCK! I was really interested in this play, but when I started reading it, I was glad it was a short play. Maybe when we do it in school it will be a little better. I hope."
3,A Difficult Play to Understand,This play is a typical Shakespeare drama which plays in the Middle Ages in Scotland. The story is about the importance of being king. It describes that they have done everything for being king. Shakespeare shows in this play very well that the common knowledge in this time was very low. The witches were the explication for everything they couldn't explain. The play has also a lot of simple humour and it shows a fight between the good and bad. And the conflict of the people between the two sides We would only recommend to read the book in English to people who really know the old English languag
5,Big-Don's Review of a Shakespeare Classic,"Shakespeare was at his best when writing this one. This classic, will continue to live on for years to come, and I can see why. It has Scotland, swords, and ghosts; what's a better combination! A sure fire winner!"
2,Not as sharp as I would like/need,"I was really hoping that this would be exceptionally sharp, but it wasn't. It cut through the vegies ok, but still lagged a bit. I think I will go the less expensive route the next time and send my current one away for sharpening. It is a lot less expensive even with shipping."
3,So-So pseudo-replacement cutter - not original,"This Champion cutter replacement blade is not as high quality as the original blade. It is gray in color, not white (color would be irrelevant except it was used in the description - which lead me to believe it was an exact match of original blade). Also the end the cutter that butts up against the spinning rod is warped, making for less extraction of juice and pulp is moist instead of dry with the original cutting blade. Won't buy cutter this cutter blade again."
2,Not White,This was definitely not white. I was really disappointed that it didn't match my juicer. It was more of an almond or gray color! It might not matter to some people but it did to me. It did say in the description white and that is what I was expecting.
3,Item exchanged,"We receive a defective item, the tree did not light up. The team at Brio was extremely helpful in getting a new track without additional hassels."
4,"VERY CUTE, My girls love it!","The Christmas tree lights twinkle with a magical sound effect to match as trains go over the track in front (or you can push a button to make it light whenever you want). My girls expecially love the present car with the sleigh bell inside and frequently use it when playing with other toys as well. I think that the tree's sound effect should have been a bit louder than ours is...its rather quiet for all of the noise that trains make rattling across the track (and little kid sound effects that go along with it). It really is a beautiful addition to the train table, and the kids that come to play seem very pleased that we have the North Pole on the train table."
3,beware of price gouging!,"At these prices, these aren't ""toys""--you wouldn't dare let kids play with your valuable collection! I'm distressed to see Amazon offering an outlet for retailers charging exhorbitant prices for ""hard to find"" items of miniscule actual value. That's what auction sites are for!"
3,These look old,"The cuttlebones received from Amazon seem like they have been sitting in a warehouse since the 90's, and the size was smaller than a normal cuttlebone. If you need one quick I guess it could do the job but there are better purchases out there."
5,healing the hidden self,outstanding perspective on healing our in most self through this experienced perspective. Barbara has a depth of understanding few have to share with those desiring to renew his/her life.
1,Leaves you uncertain what it is you are supposed to heal.,"This book confused me. Though I agree with the fact that we indeed do have a hidden self, I was uncertain what Barara Shlemon was intending for us to heal. There are some good ideas here and a modicum of depth and intrigue for the human soul, but not enough to constitute a well researched book."
5,Court is NOW IN SESSION!!!,If you haven't picked it up do yourself a favor dig in the crates & find this. Another very good hip hop record with outstanding tracks and high replay value! A+
5,Another Classic From Da Crates,"A definite hip-hop classic. This album is packed with hits including the infamous ""Power,"" originally recorded first by G. before Snap ran away with the glory, the raw ""Let Me Show You,"" and the powerhouse ""Court's Now In Session."" What's amazing is to hear an album that still sounds just as good today as it did when it was first released. And it's a shame to listen to an album like this that can still wipe out a lot of today's WHACK competition."
4,I Was Wrong,"I have to admit, when this album came out 20 years ago I had slept on it. My brother would always tell me, ""Yo, you don't know whatcha missing. Chill Rob is nice!"" It wasn't until many years later that I learned to appreciate Chill Rob G's ""Ride The Rhythm."" I always thought ""Wild Pitch"" was a hot track but that was it. But after listening & digesting Chill's lyrics, this CD is a definite must have. Chill Rob G is one of those emcees that many of us under appreciate like O.C. Court Is Now In Session, Let Me Show You, Wild Pitch, Motivation, Let The Words Flow & yes the original I Got The Power are my favorites. Chill Rob G is like fine wine, he gets better & better with age."
1,"NOT ""In the Mood""","A friend of mine got me this cd as a gift knowing that I'd asked the local record clerk about a Robert Plant's Greatest Hits cd. After fast forwarding through ""Sixty Six to Timbuktu"" I'm ready to deep sixty six this entire cd because I've discovered that I only needed a greatest HIT cd that contained ""In the Mood,""...for a melody...not this collection of bombast. I'm not much of a heavy music fan, except for Led Zepplin's ""Kashmir"" because of it's arhythmic beat, but to buy a two-disk collection of the""best"" of Robert Plant and not get ""In the Mood."" Outrageous!"
3,"Questionable Greatest Hits, Really Fun Remakes!","Yep, leaving stuff off the Plant's first (and best album) was definitely a bonehead move. There has to be some kind of murky legal reason why a track like ""In the Mood"" was left off this collection. The rest of the choice selection was good, though.But the real reason to buy this thing is for the second disc of covers. PLANT AND CO. HAVE GOT THAT GREAT '60'S PRODUCTION DOWN, MAN! The remakes of ""You Better Run"" and ""Hey Joe"" are spot on, drenched in glorious reverb with sharp stinging solos (more Otis Rush than Jimmy Page) and a bop-til-you-drop rhythm section.All the songs even fade out like great and proper '60's singles should! It's like Rhino unearthered a new set of Nuggets featuring a young Robert Plant. You can tell that guy really loved his singles collection. Fun stuff, I tell 'ya!"
3,Incomplete Picture,"No ""In The Mood""? No ""Burning Down One Side""? Nothing at all from Pictures At Eleven? For shame, Atlantic Records. A pox on you.A decent collection, but most Plant fans will already own most of disc 1. It would be nice if the powers that be would release disc 2 on its own."
1,Who mixed this?,"This compilation has most of Robert Plant's solo stuff - tall cool one, big log, heaven knows, etc. one thing missing though, WHERE IS ""IN THE MOOD????"" In the Mood is the only solo plant song ever played on the radio and without a doubt plant's greatest hit. This would be like making a Buffalo Springfield compilation and not including For What it's Worth, or a Devo compilation without Whip It. The only way to get a hold on Plant's ""In the Mood"" would be to buy Principle of Moments, which is what I did, and what I suggest you should do."
1,wawful,"i was looking forward to all the great hits and songs of robert plant throughout the 80s and 90s. I have to thank the dude at the music shop in Charlotte that did not ring me up for $24.99...instead he said: ""we can save you $10.00...there are 6 used cds of timbuk2 in the back..."" i guess that should really tell you about this album."
3,well.....,"I hate to write this review because I am a huge Led Zeppelin fan as well as a Robert Plant admirer. But I do have to agree with some of the negative sentiments of folks that haven't exactly given this double cd collection a forward nod. I will take Robert Plant at his word when he wrote in the liner notes that this is NOT a greatest hits collection. Some of you are saying, NO S#@T, Sherlock. But a collection without 'n The Mood,' one of the greatest of rock songs, is not a great idea. At least 'Big Log' is included. 'Tall Cool One' is a song that was played out way back in 1989 and it doesn't sound any fresher in the twenty first century. The second disc is worth the price, though. Mixed bag, anyone?"
4,Definetely worth it.,"Very good compilation and mastering of rare early songs and demos,and the best of Plant's solo career on a nice two disc package,though with a big omission in not including ""In the Mood"",one of his biggest radio hits and a fine 80's song to boot."
2,"How could he have left off ""In The Mood?""","I've been waiting for a collection of Robert Plant's biggest hits for years...and finally it arrives...without one of his biggest and best loved songs, ""In The Mood."" How could he have disrespected his fans so much as to have left that song off? And where are ""Burning Down One Side,"" ""Pledge Pin,"" and ""Hurting Kind?"" Those were all bona-fide hits!!! And, since ""Sea Of Love"" was graciously included on here, where is the follow-up, ""Rockin' At Midnight?"" There is WAY too much from ""Fate Of Nations"" on this album. The exlusion of those other vital tracks is a major, major, major flaw. This is a prime reason why people burn their own CDs."
3,wheres in the mood,I haven't bought this album but i heard in the vh1 classic listening party. I'm left wondering where's in the mood? That's the first solo Plant song i'd ever heard. I know Robert Plant isn't a commercial kind of guy even though he has made music videos but this is 2 cds. I mean this is more like a Robert Plant anthology. I don't think it would have hurt to include in the mood
1,"No ""In the Mood""? Ridiculous.","It's been said here already (numerous times) but I haven't said it yet. ""In the Mood"" is arguably Plant's BIGGEST song, and definately one of his best. It's exclusion here is inexcusable. In fact, there's only, what, one song from his first two (and best) solo records? Heck, even ""Hurting Kind"" is missing. If I recall that was a fairly big song for him, no?I burned my own best of Plant last year sometime, as I was tired of waiting for one to come out. Mine is 10 times better. I advise you all to do the same. Sorry, Robert."
3,Where's the rock?,"Most of the reviewers are right that the first disk is not a good sampling of Plant's music. What they fail to point out is that, aside from omitting numerous great songs, the first disk is predominantly slow stuff. You would think the guy never rocked out in his solo career, which is simply not the case. The same mistake has been made with Rod Stewart. Listening to Rod's Storyteller box set or the pink-covered greatest hits collection, you would think the guy never rocked out in the seventies. Disk two has a few great tracks, but most of it is mediocre and non-essential. The live version of ""Win My Train Fare Home"" is superb, however, better than the studio version."
3,It's a ski flag,"The flag is basically a 2 foot painted wooden stick with a flag stapled on one end and a suction cup on the other.The first flag that I received was only packed in bubble wrap. Guess what, it was broken multiple times. Contacted the reseller (MIDWEST MARINE & SPORTING GOODS) and they shipped me a replacement in no time at all (in a box this time). They were great at letting me know what was happening with the replacement. Will work with them again.The suction cup is glued/painted to the pole. It can be removed with a little work. The pole would be much better if it was made of fiberglass, but you get what you pay for."
3,safety flag,"colors are nice and vivid, but the quality of the flag is pretty low for the price. It will serve the purpose, but a white dowell with a orange piece of cloth would have served as well for the price."
2,Not well packaged,The product arrived broken. I will go to home depot and get a PVC stick that won't break. Seller should sell flag only and advise purchasers to purchase a sturdy handle separately.
5,One of the best,"Well what can I say, this was the first novel that I have read of Ms Dawsons and I was hooked onto her woork from that moment.It is a great story that captures your heart and imagination. I loved the idea of the Dammie and how they get a second chance at what hey do best, and how the heroine has to struggle with not only living in a new town but also her heritage and her new powers. Hope you enjoy this book as well"
4,"A Real Keeper, That Will You Brighten Your Life","Edward Albee's The Play About The Baby, is a wonderfully written masterpiece, that is definitely worth the read. The jokes and witty remarks, that were not catched when viewed on stage, are clearly evident and will keep you entertained for hours. The play is about a younger couple who are madly in love with eachother, and in turn, have a child. Trouble arises, when an older couple steals the baby. Edward Albee's superb writing, turns the plot into an adventure that will leave you begging for more. It is one of the most enjoyable plays that I have read in a long time, and I suggest that you give it a try."
4,Classic Albee....with a fresh feel.,"After all these years, Edward Albee still remains on top of his game. This play is classic Albee with the trademark sarcasm, biting dialogue, and socially critical themes...but with contemporary sensibilites that help keep the play from feeling old or recycled. It's also one of his funniest plays in quite a while. And, of course, Albee continues to push the envelope by tackling provocative subject matter. While this play doesn't rise to the heights achieved by Who's Afraid of Va. Woolf or Tiny Alice, it certainly ranks up with the top 1/3 of his work. Strongly recommended. A must have for any die-hard Albee fan...and should be on the short-list for any Albee virgins."
3,Satisfactory,Quick response book was satisfactory but slightly outdated. Would have desired more color illustrations.
5,Thai Pavilion Pad Thai,"300 Calories per container45 Calories from fatTotal Fat 5g (Saturated Fat 0.5g, Trans Fat 0g)Cholesterol 0 mgSodium 810 mgTotal Carbohydrate 57g (Dietary Fiber 0g, Sugars 10g)Protein 5gThe taste is surprisingly good. There is a medium spiciness to the flavor. Packs well in my purse for the commute. I use hot water from the coffee machine at work and it cooks up nicely in 5 minutes."
3,The Taste of Thai version is SO much better (and lots lower in sodium),"As of this review, I've also tried the Thai Kitchen and Taste of Thai versions, as well as Dr. McDougals RightFoods version. This one is not great tasting and is loaded with sodium - 810 mg. Taste of Thai, on the other hand, is just 320 mg (and best tasting of the lot, by far) compared to 650 for Thai Kitchen (just another so, so product). Although the sodium is listed as 480 mg for the supposedly ""healthy"" Dr. McDougal version - it's actually the highest in sodium since McDougal's is only about half a serving, so multiply 480 times 2 to get the real comparative sodium."
3,Passable Pad Thai - add some nuts,"The flavor is decent but it's a bit bland to just be eating noodles and favor packet mixed in. The product taste-wise is definitely kicked up to a 4 star level if you add some nuts in, I've found cashews go well. It adds in some crunch and taste that makes it feel a lot more like a meal than some seasoned noodles in a small tray.In terms of preparation I've had a bizarrely tough time avoiding flooding the microwave with water whenever I make this. The directions call for submerging the noodles and it's pretty tough to do with while not allowing the water to overflow once it heats and begins to boil.A so-so product overall that can be bumped up to pretty good if you take some initiative and add some extras (cashews)."
4,"Great Read, Well Structured, Worth Every Penny !!","Within 30 pages, this book had made me aware of 2/3 basic problems with my game and given me an insight into how to solve them as well.Each chapter becomes a building block for successive chapters, allowing you to correct basic faults before trying any advanced techniques. At the end of every (all that I've read) chapter there is a table that lists Common errors found within the area being improved and methods to correct them - I FOUND THIS INVALUABLE!If I had to find fault, then I wish there were more pictures/drawings to explain the techniques and drills covered. However this won't detract much from my enjoyment of the book!If you play squash for fun or are a little more serious, this book will have something to help you improve. I only hope the practice goes as well as the theory!!"
3,I'm still spinning wheels on the court,"I bought this book out of frustration. Unable to beat my partner despite practicing secretly, I was hoping this book may help improve my game. Though it has useful drills and tips, I still cannot beat my partner. Rather than award this book 4 stars and recognize limits of my talent, I hold the author responsible.This book does offer a lot to an intermediate player who needs to improve their technique. Final analysis: Very useful for the beginner to intermediary category, no revelations for strong intermediates and up.Be aware that the dimensions of book are similar to a magazine, not something you can shove into your racquet cover."
2,A basic overview,"This is a good book for beginners. It covers basic technique and some general court tactics. Squash is a difficult sport to teach via the printed medium.I have found the best way for intermediate players to improve is to watch live matches,buy or rent video tapings of the pros(and to learn how to juggle)."
5,Just lovin' the music.,"Najee is a brilliant artist,who definitely has a way with the sax.This collection is soul stirring and mellow.I enjoy all the cuts and listen to them repeatedly.I can only imagine what he's like in concert.The instrumentals as well as vocals are excellent,this is a well put together release and Jazz lovers will find this a cd worthy for their collection.Thanks Najee for letting us share your world."
5,Silky Smooth,"This was the first album that turned me onto the world of Najee. It's even one of the harder ones to find. The tract ""Secret Admirer"" is all you need to put on, and the rest of the voyage is history. This is a must-have album for any legitimate Smooth Jazz collection."
2,jazz lite,"a laid back album to the point of narcolepsy- pedestrian, mediocre, boring, etc.- blow out the candles and the incense."
1,Phil Cox,Rather plodding and dry. His story lacks spark and contains few insights that could've otherwise made it compelling and fascinating.
3,Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed: Purchased at Amazon.com,"I found this book, Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed to be very frustrating. Even though it is a book about saving hundreds of Jews in 1940's France, it seemed to be more of an examination of why some people do such good things, and also a study of some of the people who saved the Jews. While these are both worthy subjects, there was hardly any mention of any individual Jews who were saved. Obviously, many Jews were saved, but it all seemed very abstract to me, anotherwards lots of explaning, but not what I was interested in."
4,A Little Known Story,"This is a story of courage and conviction that propelled a pastor, his church, and virtually a whole village into the dangerous work of saving Jews and others at risk of deportation to concentration camps. The author describes very well the characters in this true-life drama, as well as the region in which they lived. It made me want to visit LeChambon, France where it all happened during World War II."
2,"Splendid subject, but badly written","I ordered this book because of the very interesting, exciting subject, but had to put it down after a few chapters because it was just terribly written. Disorganized, and lacking focus."
2,Too many words,"It is a good story. The author, an ethicist, has an interesting angle on it. But it takes him soooo many words to tell it. I gave up halfway through."
5,excellent book,"Philip Hallie captured some of the goodness that can come out of a war.During WWII, the community of Le Chambon helped Jews escape VichyFrance. After reading about all of the horror that occurredduring WWII, it was nice to read a book about the hope and lovethat was never lost during the war. I highly recommend this book to any avid reader.Your spirits will be lifted after reading a book like this.Once you start the book, you won't be able to put it down until it is finished."
5,Raised toilet seat,"This is a great product. For enyone with problems getting up from the toilet seat, this works great. I am very satisfied."
4,Book,The book is in good condition for a good price. This is way better then ordering through the school book store and I received it much earlier then the estimated date.
5,A brilliant work!,"This book is brilliantly conceived and executed. Fuentes does a great job of portraying a man on his death-bed, a man with much to look back on and to regret. I can't imagine anyone who enjoys literature at all not liking this book."
2,Cannot but make the judicious grieve,"When a writer starts a story in the first person, switches to the second person and finally to the third person, I usually get annoyed and stop reading. But when it's on a list of books you have to read and are going to be tested on, you keep going, more and more convinced of the stupidity of those professors in Spanish departments all over the USA who keep it on their reading lists and thus save it from the oblivion it so richly deserves and will soon attain.I give ""Artemio Cruz"" two stars only because reading it proved to me that my taste is better than that of my professors.And for those who think that the fault may lie in the translation, I can assure you that the original is just as bad, if not worse."
2,Flood not spot,These lights die not perform like the manufacturer said. They thru out a narrow beam instead of the wide flood that they should have.
2,Didn't receive all that was described.,"Did not receive the three sets of lenses, kc switch, kc covers, or a choice of lights that were described. Amazon needs to stop lying to loyal customers. Consumers be careful."
1,wrong thing,When i received this shipment it was the wrong item. I then tried to return it but our post master told us the barcode that was given to me was not regestered. The company that sold this to me still owes me over $60. Do not buy from them they just ship u any old thing if they dont have what u want.
4,Good lights. Very easy to install,These lights were very easy to install. Even added an auxiliary switch so they can be used independent of reverse. Very simple and easy to follow instructions. Just wish they could be submersed.
5,Class loved it!,My class of second and third graders really enjoyed this book. Many of them make tamales at home every year. They enjoyed reading about someone else that shares the same traditions. It opened up a lot of discussion about telling the truth. The only problem was all the talk about tamales made them hungry!
5,Starting our own tradition,"Our family loves this book! We checked it out from our local library and soon it was my four year old daughter's favorite. When December rolled around, I checked it out again, bought tamale makings and my four year old and I made cheese tamales. We took them to her pre-school class for snack along with the book. Her teacher read the book to the class and then they all had the tamales that my daughter and I made. It was a huge hit!! Now that she is in kindergarten, we will do it again (I am buying the book since I have two girls and I think this tradition will go on for a while!). Tamales are a really kid friendly activity and it was a great experience for both of us. You should try it!"
4,sweet love grooves,"I caught a package show at DC-9 once upon a time...tiny club where the stage gets maybe 2 inches off the floor. The air smells like bangs and tattoos. These fellows appear, dressed for a cricket match, blow that parochial attitude out the window with gusto. Changed my life. I would soon receive a promotion at work; meanwhile, my girlfriend Nicole gets into her first-choice grad program and a racy bathing suit. See the connection?A girl in my high-school English class had John Oates' copy of the Scarlet Letter, his name was written on the back in 1966; she should get Daryl Hall and Baby Teeth to sign it."
3,Mixed bag,I like the size of the headphone/mic. The quality of the audio is OK. The battery life is rated at 6hours. Seems like it lasts more like maybe 2 hours. Otherwise the controls work well.
1,Horrible,This thing felt like a clamp on my regular sized head. After a while wearing it my ear ached really bad even after I removed them. I tried bending them really hard but that didn't help and they just snapped right back in position. I wrote to the manufacturer but got no response. They hurt so much I just threw them out. I wouldn't wear this same model again if they paid me. I've never experienced this much discomfort with headphones. This will be my last Koss purchase.
1,Don't buy this crappy headsets.,"I've owned a few headsets in this price range, so I know they can be fragile.I used the headsets very carefully for that reason, and after only 3 months after the purchase,the headset is already broken. The part that connects the ear part and the body part of the headsetbroke randomly without any pressure. It just broke and popped out (The ear part) while I was still wearing the headset.The sound quality isn't that bad for the price, but your ears get warm after 30 minutesand the headset is just not comfortable.Buy something else. You can get better headsets for $30. The mic quality was pretty bad also."
2,Good headphones but Mic did not work at all - ever,"I thought I had problems with the sound card since none of my mics worked with it. As it turned out, the sound card just needed a reinstalled driver. Now every mic I have but this one works. Probably just a bad headset."
2,Insufficient Volume,"I'm surprised that nobody has complained about the limited volume available from these headphones. I have used other headphones with this same computer and had volume to spare, but I turned these headphones all the way up, and the volume was still too low for my old ears. I was also dissapointed to learn that there was no mute button. I found the earpieces comfortable and sound quality good, but again, not loud enough. I also thought the cord seemed flimsy compared to the heavier, Logitech cable I was used to. I will be sticking with Logitech from here on in."
2,MIC FAIL but GREAT sound.....,"man the sound was sooo good, and when i started my new job which used an on the phone service, i was thrilled at this find... until the mic just completely went out with no warning... and i lost a customer... which meant that i lost more money than i spent on the headphones themselves, due to the headphones.i still use them for the amazing sound quality and they are WICKED COMFORTABLE. but forever fail because of the obvious defect in all these headsets (ITS NOT JUST MINE IT's A GOOD 15%-30% DEFECT rate) so...2 stars because sound is great2 stars because mic failed epically2 stars because i lost me money at my job because of KOSS SB49 suck mic defects."
2,Not very good,"One thing that is badly missing is an inline mute switch, which is key if using for conference calls. I have a small head, and these fit really tight. Also, my set had this odd oily smell to it. I used them for a few days, and have switched back to my old set these were meant to replace."
1,The plastic part breaks too soon!,"I bought this headset about a year ago and yesterday it broke to parts! I did not do anything special, just trying to put it on my head! My friend's same headset also broke like 2 months ago. That one also broke from the same spot, the connection of the upper part to the ear part. Simply do not waste your money, KOSS is a really good brand but not this specific model!"
2,Nice while it lasted,"Had these 2 months and the mic went dead. They didn't go through any abuse or anything, just heavy use. The sound quality was good while it lasted, but 2 months is a pretty pathetic lifespan."
4,Nice headset...but they stink!,"Headset has good design, blocks out surrounding sound well for the price. But man do they stink. Whatever material they use to make up the ear pieces, smells heavily like burnt plastic. All in all an overall good deal, but let them sit out, open to air for a day or so before using them. Otherwise your ears will smell just as bad!"
3,Returned,"I really liked these headphones. The mic was also great for Speech Recognition use - even when there was a lot of background noise. To my huge disappointment, however, I had to return them because the sound started fading out in one ear or the other after just a few seconds of use. Double checking the connections to my laptop provided no cure. I had never returned anything to Amazon.com before and was surprised at how easy it was (Thanks Amazon). I'm going to try the Koss SB45 as a replacement. I really like the Koss headphones that I have owned over the years. I just got a bad set, I guess."
4,"Excellent Headset, Even Better Mic","Durability: Great, flexible. The mic can rotate up parallel to the headset for ease of travel.Mic Quality: Amazing. Had a Logitech mic and the mic on this headset is much better quaity.Sound: Great. Would've liked them to be more soundproof (which they aren't) but moreso than normal portal heaphones"
3,Headset,"I find the bass not quite as good as I expected, I also find that it depends on how they are connected to the computer, I also have theKoss USBDongle Adapterso I can plug into work or home.The usb adapter seems to give it better bass at work.The Mic is kind of flimsy, and it is hard to keep it as close as I'd like."
4,"great sound, awesome for voice communication!","I am a student and this is my third headphone this year, I have to talk to my parents on skype frequently, and i have been looking for a headphone which suits my need. I found this headphone the best for me. Plus, it cancels the noise. Its sound quality is also awesome. Worth the money!"
4,Good product,"It blocks out some background noise. Comfortable fit,fits to ears nicely without hurting your head at all. Quality sound, microphone also works well. The swivel movement of the earpieces is nice sometimes, but can get annoying...seems like it may break easily, but so far are holding up fine. Overall, a good buy!"
5,Great Mic for the price,"These are amazing, They fit perfectly, pick up noise on the mic extremely clear. Everything is better than expected! The sound is clean, and crisp, picks up bass better than my old mics, and these look like they can take a fall or two, not like my past ones.. Best of all, they block the noise of my dogs barking, everything is sooooo silent! I Love them!!"
5,Koss headphones,"Good sound quality and comfortable, these headphones are a good value. Looking for something to play music/videos and be able to Skype and these fit the bill perfectly."
1,Terrible headset.,"I've gone through four of these in a year due to the wires becoming loose, which leads to audio cutting out in one side or the other. I take very good care of headsets specifically to avoid this problem but they still break within 3-5 months every time. Avoid if at all possible."
4,"Great quality, but can be tight","Mine work great, but my big head can make them a bit uncomfortable. Too long and I get some fluid buildup behind my ears (which could be me, and have nothing to do with the product). However, if I put on a beanie or hoodie that covers my ears and then put on the headphones, the comfort level goes way up. So if you find yourself with a large head, might want to look elsewhere."
3,Fine for the price,"The headset ""does the job,"" and for $25 I guess you can't ask for much more, but the audio quality of the speakers in the headset is just so-so. The sound is pretty flat, the bass is weak and hollow, and the emphasis is on the mid to high-range. The mic is OK, and does a pretty good job filtering out background noise, but makes my voice sound tinny and flat, kinda like the speakers (even when playing back my voice through my real PC speakers, not the headset). But again, for like $25, they ain't bad."
4,pretty good,"i like the sound of these they have a lot of bass response, yet the highs come through pretty good too if you have an eq. i have a pair of over ear sony's and these sound way better. plus they have a mic for computer conferencing. they are a bit expensive, but it's all about the sound quality for me since it's getting harder and harder to find good quality audio equipment these days. so yeah they are worth it."
3,Glass wearers please be advised!,"If you wear glasses then I highly advise staying away from these. They clamp very tightly on the head and the cushions are only moderately soft, so frames will be digging into your skin. It becomes very painful after a while. This headset is also not very suitable for large ears.The sound quality is above average but not amazing. The microphone is fine, but my friends over Ventrilo say I sound no different than when using my $5 headset.If you have small ears and don't wear glasses, then this isn't a bad headset for the price. I on the other hand regret every dollar."
3,"Good, but short lifespan.","I owned these Koss headphones for over two years. My only gripe was the tightness of the fit. It's something I was never able to get used to. I was happy with the sound quality, both of the earphones (those large cushions really helped block out ambient room noise) and the microphone.Sadly, though they served me well, the plastic hinges of the headphones were not able to stand up to my daily use. It seems there was a trade off made between robustness and the complex folding mechanism of this design. I'm not soured on Koss, but just like everything these days, don't get too attached to them. Plastic breaks."
3,Not very good for the Koss label,"This headset didnt even last two months, the mic went out on it right away, I have bought two of these and both mics went out right away. Poor headset!!"
3,"decent, but they break",Worked great until one of the plastic hinges broke off. They were decent headphones but the plastic holding the actual earpieces failed.
4,Please Help!,"I have enjoyed using these headphones but now need to use the mic while I use the headphones. There are two plugs, but my speaker only has one plug in for the headphones. Where do I plug in the mic plug to operate both at the same time? Thanks!"
1,All reviews are biased,Please be careful. most of these reviews are from Koss SB49 Communication Stereophone. These are definitely biased review since Koss wants to sell.
1,Idiot product,Careful you might need and external power supply for this microphone ($9.00) that only Koss or Radio Shack sells...Didn't see that listed anywhere above didja? This produduct should be shoved up the makers behind. Amazon should not be selling this product. PERIOD.
4,Definately Worth Your Money,"They are cheap and they work well, decent base but not overpowering, nice sound quality. The mic is very nice in terms of quality and it also is easily used for voice recognition software, the whole thing is very flexible... unless your REALLY harsh with headsets... you shouldn't break these at all. They warm your ears up alot, to a point where they get uncomfortable.. but being that it is winter right now... that makes walking outside with these on very cool, keeps my ears warm. I definately like these and would recommend them to anybody."
2,Should have stuck with Logitech.,"I bought these in October of '09. At first I was very pleased, but after an hour or so of use my ears were practically burning because they hurt so bad. For anyone who spends any time playing a computer game, an hour is not going to cut it. I can't adjust the volume too high without the speakers crackling, which ruins any music for me. Finally, the left speaker is starting to go. I didn't expect them to last too long, but I think three months is a bit ridiculous. My last pair was Logitech and was purchaed in '07 at around the same price, and lasted until I bought these. I'll stick with Logitech from now on."
2,Not comfortable for me,"I found that my ears really hurt after about 30 minutes to an hour of wearing this headset. The quality seemed very good and the the mic was also great. However, I had to return them because it definitely was not "" long lasting comfort."""
2,Mic broken after about a month,"It is ok headset for gaming and skyping. Not so great for music, sound is pretty flat, but that is sort of expected from $30 item.For me microphone stopped working after approximately one month of use and had throw it away, alas."
1,earphone,doesnt workive bought koss headsets before and they worked find i dont know why this wont work i hate it
5,A Must Have For Worshippers,"If you like CeCe Winans or Martha Munizzi, I guarantee your going to love Vicky Yohe. With her heart after God and anointed voice, she quickly ushers you into the presence of God. Pick up your copy today!"
2,Did not care for it,"I did not like one song in this album. Either the musical arrangement was somehow lacking or her delivery of the songs left a lot to be desired. The background vocal and her singing sometimes made me feel like I was at one of those charismatic, ""tongues"" believing church or a baptist church."
4,"Good device, but not great.","Our Chevy truck has chrome on the forward facing part of the mirror. After using these mirrors for a few camping trips, it ended up getting a little scuffed. It wasn't bad, but it was noticable.I would have taken them off after each trip, but the installation (although not overly difficult) was not easy enough for me to do so every day.As for functionality, the mirror is a little small, and although it DID give me increased visiblity, it wasn't quite what I was expecting.Maybe I was expecting too much from this mirror, but I couldn't bring myself to give it 5-stars. I'll keep using them (especially since the chrome is already scuffed!!!), but this isn't a 5-star item."
1,junk,save your money. cheap plastic stuff that wont work. it wont stay on the mirror it is supposed to attach to. falls off blows off.
5,I am sure they work great,"I am sure they work great, if you buy them for the right truck. Sadly the hubby bought the wrong ones. They took them back no problems and sent us what he should have ordered in the 1st place...So pay attention, if it clearly states ""NOT"" for blaw blaw blaw, and you own a Blaw Blaw Blaw, don't order them LOL"
3,Worth the Price,"Much better than towing with just the stock mirrors. I found these difficult to properly adjust as the mirrors are so tight. I guess better than they be falling out of place all the time. These do stay on the stock mirrors better than expected. For the price, not bad overall."
3,mirrors,"extension-mirrors appear to be as described but do not fit my truck with the little insert bracket part...maybe that fits mirrors that do not have chrome trim on them (my truck has chrome) Have not had a road trip with the units at hwy speeds but they appear to be much more stable than the strap-on mirrors I had b4. I think I will use a small bottle cap in place of the insert bracket under the clamp-on screw and tie the units onto the truck mirror with a short string (run thru a 1/4"" hole drilled thru the bottom of the extension-mirror) just to be sure the wind does not blow them off. They fit snug without this precaution but we have some awsome crosswinds in this area."
4,Trailing mirrors,I have not had the opportunity to use these mirrors yet but they came in great time and am planning the first trip next weekend
2,does NOT fit a 2001 Chevy Blazer,Does NOT fit a 2001 Chevy Blazer even though it said it would. Good return policy though... hence the extra star.
5,Mirrors,These look great and work very good I have a chev 2008 we tow a 29 ft camperjust what we were lookin for easy on easy off.
3,"They work, but...","The towing mirrors work as advertised, with very little vibration while in motion. I would be happier if they would stay in place. With our Suburban, once the speed gets up over 50 mph the extra air pressure forces the side view mirrors back an inch or so. I then have to readjust the towing mirror so I can see. This gets old in a hurry. While I realize this is more a problem with the tow vehicle than with the mirrors themselves, it is the mirrors which are creating the extra wind drag.In addition, if you choose to buy these, be sure to snap them on securely. I had one fall off which I thought I had secured properly."
2,WON'T FIT,"After using the provided program, to make sure that they would fit my veicle, I purchased these mirrors. Guess what. THEY DON'T FIT!!!! No problem. I just return them. WHAT!? You want to charge me to return them? Because it's not your fault that I want to return them. Guess what. It is your fault. I wouldn't have purchased them if you hadn't told me that they would've fit.Thanks a lot."
1,Very cheaply Made,"Items are very Cheaply made, and hard to install. Better off to upgrade to the factory towing mirrors. Saves you time and money."
4,Performed as well as could be expected.,"I purchased these for my GMC Sierra 1500 for pulling a 24' enclosed race car trailer as the stock mirrors did not extend far enough to see down the side of the trailer while pulling. The fit is great and they look pretty good, almost like they are stock. They provide just enough extension to see down the side of the trailer. I have not used them extensively for a long haul, just short around town trips, but they get the job done. I did not want the strap-on variety because I felt that at speed they might not stay on and provide a vibration free view and purchased these and am very happy."
4,Towing Mirrors,These mirrors work great. They help us clearly see traffic around our camper. The mirrors can easily be attached or removed.
4,Works as advertised,"I've used these on about four camping trips on my surburban and they work as I'd expect. A little more visibility on the sides was what I was looking for. Installation is bit tight, but that helps keep the fit secure. I can see how they would scratch the chrome version mirrors. Mine are all black so it does not matter. Good price/performance."
3,ok,"People are really dumb sometimes!!If you got a problem with the glasses just cut the band in half,so you can take them off and put them back on.That's what i did and it's perfect.It is tough to play with the hat on and im trying to figure a solution to that one.I have two of these.I left the first one in the package because it said:WRESTLING CLASSIC.And if you want a funner sgt slaughter get the legend vs. legend killer.Comes with randy orton and s.slaughter.Hat and glasses are removable!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Comprehensive, but dated","In reviewing this work as a required text for my class, several of my classmates commented (and I agreed) that many of the studies cited in this book are dated; numerous cites were from the 1970's and even from pre-1950's. The other theme noticed about this book was that a large majority of the perceptions made by the authors applied to law enforcement organizations from the East coast and although West Coast organizations were mentioned, many of these points seemed dated (again, referring to the first comment)."
1,A failure as a textbook,"As one reviewer noted, this book is comprehensive; it covers a wide breadth of topics. Unfortunately, most of the conclusions are based on studies from the 1960's and 70's. Anything to do with technology is dated; anything remotely technologically modern is treated with a ""gee whiz"" attitude. The final chapter on the future of policing is a joke, with the typical dystopian Bladerunner fantasy combined with the authors' personal speculation about world politics (we must create an international police force! etc.). The authors also draw way too heavily on NYPD with only casual mentions of practices in other police departments (earth to authors: no one outside of NYPD has a ""Rabbi"" FYI). Not sure why my department picked this book for its promotional test, but they did, so I'm stuck with it. Finally, the typos, mispellings, and instances of outright incorrect information are ghastly. I certainly would not recommend this book for academic use or promotional tests."
4,Going back to school,"This is a great collection of songs from the seventies and eighties. It consists mainly of full-length LP or 12-inch versions of funk, disco and R&B; tunes. They generally are in the five to seven minute range. It's certainly a welcome alternative to the edited single versions that are recycled on countless compilations time and again. Eventually, some of these tunes would be sampled in later years by other artists. There are three single versions on this album: ""Think (About It)"" by Lyn Collins,""Pass The Peas"" by The JB's and ""September"" by EWF. This collection is great for parties or get togethers. If you like extended versions then you'll enjoy this album.The first disc runs 78 minutes and the second 72 minutes."
4,Photos Are Excellent.... But... Printer needs some tweeking,"I have had this for 2 months, replaced the much larger HP. Two problems off the bat... doesn't hold enough copier paper in the tray, so I'm constantly refilling it. Also doesn't have a very good paper ""stopper"" for multiple copies... it literally shoots the copies all over the place, I had 25 pages all over the room!! The paper tray is flimsy. One more thing.. I print on-line postage and use single sheet adhesive sheets, but it doesn't recognize this type of paper, so error message reads ""Paper is upside down"", so I have to keep feeding the page in until it finally accepts it. Great quality for photo reprints... loved the fact I can reprint my 4 x 6 photos."
2,HP C6150C Pump motor stalled,"My HP C6150C says ""Pump motor stalled"" on the display. After all else failed, I took it outside and dropped it on the ground from six inches or so, twice for good measure. Honestly, that fixed it.Won't print black/white with an empty color cartridge. It becomes a boat anchor else a pumpkin at midnight. Idiots!"
1,Simply the worst printer I've ever owned,"Does ""everything"", but nothing well at all. This printer is buggy, unreliable and goes through (expensive!) ink cartridges even when printing in black only. The printer will usually not restore the wireless network connection upon coming out of sleep, leaving me to fully power cycle the device. Other bugs and crashes seem to appear weekly. Color ink cartridges seem to dissapear in a hurry, even when using black only (greyscale). The printer case itself is flimsy and poorly thought out. The only plus side is that the scanner seems to work fairly well and has a variety of different media support. In short, I will be searching for another brand of printer as this one is nothing short of frustrating."
1,Waste of Money & Time,"I bought this product 3months before. The product works fine, but the problem is with the software. The software hangs most of the time. I was unable to connect the printer using USB cable. When I called customer support and did all the steps, finally the agent was unable to fix the problem. Finally I could connect the printer using network cable, but still the software won't respond, once you have done with scanning."
1,Don't buy an HP printer!!!!!,There is no customer service for HP products. I have had 2 HP printers break within 5 years and have been unable to fix them. They are cheap junk. I have learned my lesson and will no longer buy HP.
2,Butchered,"This is such a poorly edited version of one of my all time favorite movies. I saw this movie years ago on a premium movie channel. A fabulous spy story which was well acted and directed. I was excited to find it on video and bought it right away but when I watched it, it hardly made any sense due to having parts edited out. Perhaps it had to be shortened to fit a television spot but key parts on the story are missing. It's as if it had been shortened by someone who hadn't watched it first to see what mattered. Don't buy this."
2,He tried.....,"I love this guy, but in all honesty, this album was not good. The song selection was poor, just doesn't have it like his first. I didn't care much for his second either, but this one was no better. He needs a better song writer if he's going to compete with his rivals David Bisbal, David Civera and others that came from the European version of ""American Idol""."
3,More than worth the money,This is one of the best cd's I've bought in a long time. If you really enjoy Ronnie Milsap then you have to have this one. It has all his best songs in one cd.
1,Ultimate Ronnie Milsap,"I got this for my brother who is in a VA hospital. He was very disappointed and said it did not sound good at all; like it was a homemade copy. As it was a gift, I felt very bad. If someone can recommend a good Ronnie Milsap that is from his first years in the business, I would appreciate it. I did not hear the CD so I cannot judge for myself but I send him lots of CD's and this is the first one he has complained about."
1,Wrong in every way,"I was born & raised in Grundy; as well I am the same age and did attend school with Wanda. She was a very sweet little girl that did not deserve to die in the horrible fashion that she did.It was a very small town where everyone knew everyone and it was in this way that I also knew Roger, he was a lowlife in every sense of the word.He was a rapist, a murderer, and a liar to the end.The end of his life should have been as painful and terrifying as the one he made for Wanda."
5,One of the best books I have ever read,"This book is thought-provoking and heart-wrenching. I agree with the reviewer who said that everyone who is in favor of the death penelty should read it. I think the title says it all. I wish the publisher would print an undated edition with any new information about the continuing effort to find Wanda McCoy's true killer. As much as the tragedy of Roger Coleman's death haunts me, it is Wanda who has stayed in my mind long after I finished the book. This is not a typical true-crime book. It is an important exploration of our criminal justice system and our morality as a nation. If you are looking for a thought-provoking read, you could not choose a better book."
1,Guilty after all,"Don't bother to read this one, folks. Coleman was found guilty after his D.N.A. was re-tested posthumously. All that publicity for a murderer, yet no justice for the 19-year old girl he brutally raped and killed. This man is exactly the pig we thought him to be, and now it's been proven."
2,Movie of the Week...and not a good one.,"Innocent guy gets charged...has a bad lawyer...gets sentenced to death...misses appeal by one day...young, energetic lawyer comes to help...finds another suspect...new evidence is ignored and appeals denied... (Fill in the blanks as you find necessary. I'm sure you won't be off by much)Not a bad story, but nothing really surprising or unusual happens. Is Roger Coleman innocent? Maybe, but the evidence isn't overwhelming. Either way, this book was only mildly interesting, and I would have put it down a long time ago if it wasn't assigned for a class I'm in. I'd recommend you find something else...unless you're in the class, too."
3,Pity Judges and their clerks,"Often, a review of a ""True Crime"" book will praise it as: ""It reads like a novel!"" There is little chance of confusion here. This book on an important subject is leaden and plods along, passive sentence upon passive sentence.The author, who ""Practiced law for many years in Chicago, where he was a leading criminal defense attorney,"" duly sets forth all the relevant data to support the his case, (there is even a very helpful Index at the end, in case one forgets who is who.) But it just did not retain my attention e.g. ""Read this because you need to, not because you want to.""This is what Legal Research and Writing Professors warn us about. It is easier to persuade the intended audience if you first keep them awake. If this is what the preponderance of legal briefs submitted to appellate courts reads like, pity the poor judges and their clerks!"
4,I wish this book were true,"I loved this book, and found it to be a compelling account of the execution of a probably innocent man. Unfortunately, today (1/12/06) DNA tests conclusively demonstrated that Coleman was, in fact, guilty as charged. It's still a beautiful book (if a book about the death penalty can be considered beautiful), but probably not worth reading now that the central premise has been disproved."
3,Not what I anticipated.,"I have a hard time finding historical information on the culture and humanity involved with the great depression; most books only care about where the economy/money was at the time. This book appeared on its cover to address people, but its entirely charts and demographics and stocks and stuff. It looks entirely thorough and comprehensive and I'm sure is great resource for others, but make sure you want lots of graphs and numbers, with no people."
2,At least he start out right,"Overall Bernanke does a good job at looking at different theories, but his theories on the dangers of deflation have been refuted by many authors. It is too bad that this theory clouds his vision, or else his treatment of the depression would have a lot more authority.For the economist, I would highly recommend ""America's Great Depression"" by Murray N. Rothbard. He is by far the most thorough in his treatment of the period, delivering the most compete and well founded theory for the cause of the Great Depression, too bad Bernanke hasn't read it."
3,It's a pad,"I've used this on a recumbent bike, but always end up using a pillow. However I did use a as seen on TV forever comfy and it works great. Just cut to size"
2,Not enough cushion for the tush,"I have a Stamina Airgometer stationary exercise bike. The seat is more cushiony than any other stationary bike I have seen, however, sit on it for 20-30 minutes and the comfort factor is diminished within the first 5 minutes. I did allot of research looking for a bike cushion that would fit the slightly over sized seat of the bike. there's not allot of options out there so I purchased the Sunlite cover. At $30+ I was hesitant but what's the sense of exercising on a bike if it becomes a literal pain in the arse. I received the cover and installed it...not enough cushion for the tush, very little difference. I finally just placed a pillow over the whole thing. And voilla...Bottom line, this cover is not worth the money."
4,Comfortable and good fit,It fits perfectly my recurrent bike Stamina 4825 and makes the seat much more comfortable during long exercise time period
3,It's okay,"I put it on my recumbent cycle seat, enabling me to ride for longer periods of time while just watching TV.I wish it was a little thicker. But it's okay. It definitely made the seat more comfortable."
1,Awful,"This movie was horrible. It was just plain SO BAD. Yea its got occasional hard core scenes. The guys aren't hot. It was boring, cheap, choppy, i found myself fast-forwarding through most of it. I couldnt wait til it was over. Worst mistake i ever made was buying it. Just keep on browsing for other movies!"
1,cheaply made gay porn,"I bought the film becuse I thought it was a comedy, I am familiar with Scott Thompsons work on the TV show ""The Kids In the Hall"". The movie stinks. Poor acting, It appears more ad-lib than scripted and basically has no redeeming values. Unfortunately neither ...(the website) nor the Internet Movie Data Base contain any information on the movies EXPLICIT content. The movie would be rated X (possibily triple X to attract the intended audience) if it was rated. do yourself a favor and save your money, pass on this. the worst film I ever attempted to view, and to be fair, I couldn't watch it after the first twenty or so minutes, it is that bad"
1,INFERIOR PRODUCT & SERVICE,"The mat looked pretty nice when I got it, but after a few mins of light usage for stretching, a tear developed in the middle which is VERY disappointing. I guess the only good thing is that the mat is so thick that the rip did not go all the way through. A few more uses later, the ends of the mat get stretched out and now the entire thing is lopsided and wont balance after being rolled up - looks like the Leaning Tower of Pisa.I contacted them for an exchange, which they agreed on, but I have not heard from them for over a MONTH now since after I wanted to clarify the procedure to do so."
3,Nice drawer if if isn't bent,"I'm refurbishing an old Shopsmith and needed a quick way to add storage to the bench... This drawer was a great solution, but of the two that I ordered, one arrived looking like it had been hit by a truck. It seemed that the issue was with the manufacturer, not Amazon. So I'm now waiting for a new drawer... and the shipping time is looong. Update.... 3 out of four drawers were bent and missing hardware. Amazon's packing was perfect and the inner boxes from the manufacturer looked ok but the drawers were bent. Amazon accepted the returns and has replaced the drawers each time but i finally just kept one that wasnt too badly bent. I did some bodywork on it but i will hesitate to buy another edsal product."
5,A Whopping Amount Of Good Work,"Whew! What a book! I've just finished Mountaineers' Honor. How did John ever get so much information, so many characters into it? I never knew that every wide place in the road had skirmishes or battles. It must've been terrible. I've never read that much about the Civil War, and never heard much said about it. John must've done a whopping amount of research! A family farming on an island in the middle of the Kanawha River is amazing. John needs to keep up the good work!Sibyl Jean Jarvis PischkeAuthor of ""The Legend of Mammy Jane"""
5,Dreaming of pieces...,A few years ago my aunt gave my mom and me this puzzle. We took about 40 hours to put it together without looking at any picture. We love puzzles and this one was fun. The pictures are very colorful and after getting the sections together is a whole other puzzle as now it is time to figure out the maze to solve the puzzle!Loads of fun. I was greatly entertained. And I recommend this product
5,A great piece of work!,"Hesiod's ""Theogony"" is excellently translated by Richard S. Caldwell. I have read other translations of Hesiod but preferred this one because it is done in verse as opposed to prose. The verse is not difficult to understand; the notes to the text are clear and good; the topic is made more interesting by way of the writing style. Overall, a very good piece of work."
1,Boring...tries too hard,"No originality...Boring. ""Retro,"" lounge music appeal diminished after first 2 minutes. Tries too hard, ""overacting"" of songs."
4,Drive functions excellently,"If you are looking for a lot of storage space and an easy-to-use device, this is it! I have a Mac and have had no compatability problems. I have not tried yet, but am told that I can use it with PCs as well.If you are looking for something portable though, this is not it.It has no USB port."
1,Crashed Within Days,"Yes, I see all of the glowing reviews of this drive, but to be balanced, I bought one, installed it on my Mac on Friday as a backup drive, it worked fine for three days, and by Monday it was clicking loudly and wouldn't spin up. So, I guess for every nine of these that are good there's one that's bad. I'll probably spend more and get a Maxtor/Seagate/Western Digital."
5,Quite happy with this....,"Went shopping for an external drive to back up my data before having to blast my internal drive. I do a lot of webdesign and databases and needed to save my records. Found this baby and may go back for another. This drive is super quite, super cool and even easy to transport if needed and the data transfer is excellent."
5,good product,"it looks good and feels good too, it is much better than the regular pad without the foam or gel pillow.the only problem would be the shape, it looks like it is made for left hand."
4,Its a text book,In the world of Textbooks this is pretty much the same. It is easy to read and it does have some nice examples.
3,not a bad book,"This book is very much so a civil procedure review, with some trial prep tactics built in. I would reccommend using it in conjunction with a civil procedure class, but if you have already taken a civil procedure class, it is rather tiring and long"
3,Used as a textbook . . .,"I'm presently in law school, and Pre-Trial is being used as a textbook. Therefore, it is roughly organized from the perspective of teaching a student the art of trial prep. There are other books more worthy. So, remember this is essentially a textbook."
5,A Must-Read For Anyone Not Thought-Impaired.,"Look. I'll be real brief. You can read some good reviews on this page for this wonderful book. But my suggestion is this. Turn off the tv. Go out and buy this book. Read it. Discuss it with your friends and loved ones. Go out at night and look at the stars. If you live in a city, take some time off, then go out where you can reflect for a moment on the vastness of the universe, and the razor-thin biosphere that protects us from cold blackness of space. Read this book again. As Wilson says ""There is no one looking over our shoulder. Our future is entirely up to us."" Find a place to start, in some small way, to make the world a little better. Life (as in yours and mine) is short. The clock is ticking. The time to start is now... You can do no better than to start with this book."
2,Rambling,"I don't understand why many of the reviewers here seem to think this is an ""important"" book. What is so important or revolutionary about the notion that science should be done in a multidisciplinary way, incorporating any methods or information that may be useful? Dr. Wilson is obviously a prodigious intellect. His apparent knowledge in so many diverse areas was at times breathtaking. His writing is very elegant. But still, I have to say even though I agree with much of what the author said I found the book to be curiously irritating. At times it felt like the doctor was sort of just showing off. Quite often he just seemed to be rambling on for the sake of impressing us with his knowledge of some obscure topic. Ok, we got it, scientists should think outside the box of their narrow specialty. That point could be made in about 10 pages, without an extended demonstration of the authors own ability to learn something about a lot of other specialties."
2,"Wilson appears to take a ""leap of faith"" in Consilence.","In speaking about the ""Ionian Enchantment"" Wilson feels that its central ""tenet, as Einstein knew is the unification of knowledge. When we have unified enough certain knowledge, we will understand who we are and why we are here."" This sounds like consilence to me. Wilson has no scientific proof that this will happen. We have the age old debate I cannot prove scientifically that there is a God (I believe there is) and Wilson cannot prove scientifically that there is not a God. True he is talking about the Ionian enchantment but I think he should make more use of the conditional tense."
2,Insults Christians Right off the bat,Anyone who learns to think would not believe the Bible. So he says.This is a cut beyond excuse.
3,good info - tough read,"This book has great information but it is a tough read, I feel. It is worth reading if you have the time."
2,Valid Claim but Vain Attempt,"I bought this book unsuspiciously, and read it with the mind of a student who is very attached to this subject -- for I studied philosophy and art together with engineering and science. The style is elegant and might impress the virgin reader. But any person with a minimum level of awareness will read through the flaws and become very annoyed by the numerous inconsistencies. The references, albeit looking diverse and accurate, are also misused in most cases, because they are used as quick justifications. Mr. Wilson is not knowledgeable enough to publish such an ambitious project: 'uniting knowledge'. This book can only be recommended as an introduction to the subject -- it does cover a great deal of topics, and the scientific descriptions are more relevant than the historic and artistic ones."
3,eloquent but still an unrealistic reach,"This was the first book I have ever read by Wilson and I must say that I was impressed with the eloquent style and passionate conviction he presented. I must say, however, that the overall idea of consilience is a major reach and will never happen. Like alchemy or the fountain of youth it is a grand idea but human nature will never let it happen."
2,"Tick-Toc, Tick-Toc, E. O. Wilson's a Crock","Dr. Wilson admires the organization and efficiency of ant colonies. He admires them so much, he seems to think that humans will eventually come to their senses and live like them. This book was tedious reading, and I was bothered by the author's stylistic habit of straddling both sides of arguments without making a convincing case for one or the other.He parrots the popular, gloomy environmental cliches of rain forest destruction, global warming, and tragic extinctions, and to me, loses all credibility as an independent thinker. Perhaps Wilson has already made the transition to ant-logic and ant-thinking <g>."
2,Hard to believe,"For a man with his obvious knowledge it is hard to believe what you see is what you get with the universe. It is quite obvious there is a Designer, yet wilson believes the designer was blind chance. It is also hard to believe most scientists share his belief and dismiss the notion of Creator. Are we to believe the eagle, Mozart and oak tree all came from the same source? By accident?"
2,Somewhat disappointing,"Your reaction to this difficult read will depend on your starting point. If you are reasonably scientifically literate and fairly widely read, the concept of consilience will not be too surprising or novel. Scientists have been talking about unifying theories and basic laws in nature for a very long time. This book will probably add little to the overall understanding of the concept.The case for the argument is made tortuously, with many apparently pointless diversions and too few pointers to the underlying thesis. Basically, I found that the theme got lost in intellectual meandering. If you are not scientifically minded, it is unlikely that this book will bring you closer to the concept. Its language is unnecessarily convoluted and intimidatingly formal. A book written by a scientist for scientists. I look forward to a more succinct focussed publication on this topic."
4,Insight beyond everyday perception,"Wilson has written one of the most courageous and thought-out books I have ever read. His ideas go beyond what we normally accept as reality. Each new concept made me stop and reconsider, think and explore, reject or accept, and finally, change my views or strengthen old ones. Each person who reads this book must come their their own realization of what it means. I encourage everyone to at least pick it up. Although many of Wilson's ideas are sketchy or at least unproven, the essentials of it are timeless and unshakable."
5,You cannot ignore the importance of this book,"If you don't ready any other chapter in this book, read the last chapter, E.O. Wilson's case for saving our environment. And, an incredible argument is it. Our oceans are dying, humans are over-running the planet, we are killing off plants and animals equal to the catastrophe that ended the dinosaurs--and despite it all scientists carry on as if the many disciplines of science are not connected by the common ground of physics. His plea is that in order to avoid what he believes (and I agree with him whole-heartedly) are truly the inevitable consequences of our species' footprints on this planet He argues forcefully that expansionism and exceptionalism-the idea that humans are an exception to the laws of physics and evolution-are clearly wrong in their assumption that we can continue to grow as we have and that technology can somehow save us from the environmental disasters we are facing."
3,Review of Wilson's 'Consilience',"This lengthy and disparate discourse features a fair introduction to a hundred different niches of science and the humanities, yet it produces little conclusive sentiment to sway the reader's vision of the science-humanities divide. Frankly, the work feels as though Wilson wanted to lightly research his favorite topics in the sciences and humanities, present them, and then draw a few, light-hearted comparisons between them. To that extent, his work is excellent. If I had known nothing about genetics or neuroscience or Nabokov, I might now know a little. However, the work is hardly a serious exercise in the unity of science and the humanities. I'll add on a personal note that Wilson's casual rejection of Foucault--right from the get-go--did little to earn my trust or respect. This work might satisfy some readers, but what I found was a lengthy, tattered collection of musings from an aging author of popular non-fiction."
3,"Good read, but too optomistic","Great book, but I think Wilson is being too optomistic about the future of ""soft"" sciences. I don't think there will be a peaceful coexistence and give 'n take relationship of hard and soft sciences like Wilson suggests. In my veiw, as soon as the hard sciences have the capacity to tackle complex social ineractions they will blow the soft sciences out of the water."
2,Disappointing!,"Ed Wilson has written a disappointing book which desperately wants to make a case for science, but unfortunately ends up more an assault on religion and Biblical scholarship, which Wilson would probably consider an oxymoron. Why the assault on religion? Here's a tip for anyone wanting balanced scholarship without pretentions: read physicist Gerald Schroeder's much more plausible book, ""The Science of God, or biologist Michael Behe's work, ""Darwin's Black Box."" Wilson's point is this: it is by sheer luck that everything came together in the first place. Fine. But why write off, as either mysoginistic or intellectual idiots, those who think otherwise? Isn't concilience supposed to be a coming together? Moreover, Wilson's point is not all that well developed, and wanders here and there. I expected more, and got less, that's why I rate the book so poorly."
1,An unfounded diatribe against a nameless enemy.,"Wilson is still living in the age of enlightenment, in a vast Euclidian world governed by Newton's dynamics. Things are more complicated than that: even a deterministic system can be chaotic, and physics is not deterministic! But Wilson tries to deny these obvious facts. A failure, to say the least."
1,Not as good as it looks,It is exactly as described and pictured...but I am unhappy with how it looks...the cheap plastic this item is made of looks even cheaper in person.
4,The life of the king of cool,"With the movie ""Bullitt"" ranking at the very top of my euphorometer (how I felt leaving the theater)Steve McQueen from that day forward was my ultimate hero. Marshall Terrill has done me, and all Steve's fans, a great favor in this detailed examination of Steve's life. Many interesting tidbits emerge about Steve's relationships with other actors and how films projects developed. From Wanted Dead or Alive to big screen triumph, to the economic catastrophe of Le Mans, and onto his utter domination in the Towering Inferno, one feels as though he is present at those creations. Some touching moments too as Mr. Terrill tells us of Steve's battle with cancer and inner conversion. I often go back and reread portions of this indispensible book."
4,Harvey Mushman is the man!,A really nice book. Kinda wordy but full of great info! Enjoy it casue if you like SM you'll like seeing what his life was really like
3,steve mcqueen hollywood hype story,"Probably written by his press agent. Interesting read for Steve McQueen fans, of which I am one."
2,Very fragile and hard to use,"I've bought three of these already and the cord connecting the tweezers to the board has come off each when pulled even slightly. Also I have a friend who builds computer chips, with the steadiest hand you've ever seen, and he could only get three of the easier pieces out after much effort. The pieces slip off an indentation on the tweezers which makes for a frustrating game. I can't see any kids being able to be successful with this version of the game. The sounds are great, though, very clear."
3,Not very sticky gloppy or wacky,Was disappointed in the content of this book. Therewere some great experiments but I really wanted gloppyor wacky and that kind of experiment just wasn't there.
4,very helpful,"This is a great tool. I have been using it for years. But I take exception to one particular statement in the book. The author claims it is much easier to get an agent to look at your work than an editor. In my experience, this is totally false. In fact, I have found it is 10 times easier to get an editor to read my stuff than an agent. I guess the author is biased in this respect, since he himself is also an agent."
3,On the other hand,"This is a huge and expensive book. It's also, for my purposes, terribly out of date. Several of the agents I've contacted have moved or are longer in the business. It has some very good features such as the advice section but I could've gotten the same advice for free from the internet. As other reviewers have noted there is an easier and cheaper way to get writing information. Pick up a book that is similar to the stuff that you write. Go to the dedication or thanks page and read it. Many authors thanks their agents and editors. Write down those names and track them down. It takes more time but it's easier on your pocketbook and will probably be more accurate.Next year I will by the Writer's Market book instead."

5,Wicked comfort! Love this shoe!,"The best shoe I have ever owned! Excellent quality, so well made they will last a long long time, the style is great, the polka dots are small and do not look tacky, they are perfect to wear with your jeans or comfy pants. Perfect price, definitely looking to buy more in different style and color. This C1RCA shoe is wonderful for people of any age, I am 35+ woman and you don't have to be a skater to wear them. All around perfection!"
5,my favorite kicks,I love love love leopard print anything. These are super stylish and I had no break in time so also instant comfort. The only thing is I need a second pair because I am wearing them out.
4,ReadingRainbow,"The book keeps you interested, although I didn't feel a whole lot of love between the characters Marietta and Derek. I recommend the book to those who don't mind if the heroine has been around the block several times. Rosemary Rogers fans will like or love it. If you're a fan of Kathleen Woodwiss you may want to re-think your selection."

1,More gore disguised as romance,"I read romance for that - romance - and not rape, torture and sadism. It's hard to be sympathetic to a heroine who sleeps around, and repulsive to read about constant violence. What was it about this decade that made women think that in brutalization lay true love?"
5,You cant put this one down.,This is the first of three books about the life of a woman who was framed and sentenced to slavery. It's a brilliant read. This was the book that put Jennifer Wilde right up the top in the New York times best-seller list.
3,Powerful and repetitive,"Robert Miles ""Dreamland"" is a pretty good cd. It is repetitive but in a positive way. The electronically systematical music takes a shape that forms the human mind. If you close your eyes and just listen to the music, your mind could take you to all kinds of new heights. I don't mind the electronic pulse and must admit that I must have listened to ""Children"" (01 and 09) a couple of dozen times. I love it each time. This music is relaxing and puts you in a good mood."
3,I feel like I'm floating when I listen to this,I love how the electronica beats and piano work together on this CD. Still sounds very modern TO ME even over 15 years later.
4,a great trance CD...,"I usually don't here that kind of music at all but ""dreamland"" is special... you can listen to it from the beginning to the end Everything is good especially ""children"" and ""one & one""...you can buy it, play it loud, even your dog will like it !!!"
2,Mind-numbing -- and NOT in the good way.,"I have listened to this disc many times, trying to find a comfort zone with it, but alas, I must surrender. After the first seven minutes of the CD have passed (and I admit to liking those first few minutes), the rest of the CD becomes nothing more to me than a thumping aural assault. Miles has some very interesting ideas musically, but they get lost behind the relentless hammering and it's easy to lose interest after a while. Perhaps if the volume of the beat was toned down just a little, I could give it another star or perhaps two. I can highly recommend it to dance to, but casual listening is apparently not what's intended with this disc. In summary, great musical ideas overwhelmed by the thump."
5,excellent spiritual journey,"though the disc is somewhat repetative, the aura emmitted by the cd is amazing. it is a great blend of piano and trance like effects. if you are a fan of sasha, oakenfold and others this is a must have, despite being different in ways. i have 2 copies, 1 in my truck and 1 in my home player."
5,Oldie but a goodie,"I've had this cd for a while, and while most ppl are right when they say that many tracks are repetitive, its still well worth it. Track 6 is my favorite by far, by the way. If you havent tried this type of music before, you will be very glad you did, as you'll be instantly hooked. I'm a big trance fan, and this cd was what kinda got me into the genre."
5,A wonderful journey for the mind!!!,"A very wonderful CD that brings out your imagination. One of the best CDs I have. Trust me, you MUST get this album!!!"
4,great music!,this album has been designed with great instrumental sounds to it. if sounds soothing yet like you are far away from your problems in your life and just being carefree...buy it. you will enjoy it!
2,Good house music does not equal good music,"2 1/2Competent though disappointing, this highly referenced trance album cannot escape it's plodding, dated backbone of a beat, no matter how refined and professional the production tries to be. Of course, listening to the album 13 years later, one immediately feels the bland, aged thump soaked into the generic sequencing and tonality, which is not to say the album was not worthy of the praise it garnered upon release-in House-centric circles that is. The thudding, ever present, 4/4 layering of a pulse that guides entirely too much mainstream electronic music out there will vastly undermine any of the dreamy atmosphere heavily present on this ambitious little club-hopper, rendering most of the Yanni-with-edge keyboard melodies banal. Thankfully once in a while, particularly at the start and finish of the disc, a semi-potent spell is afforded these static conditions, allowing Dreamland to shine in refreshingly unrestricted ways."
1,Pop Poop,"I don't know much about Robert Miles, but it sound to me like he may have wandered too far out into the cyberlights. This record is straight up pop from an artist who obviously doesn't really understand current dance sensibilities - although it might make a nice movie sound track. Instead I suggest listening to the Relentless Legs mix of Underworld's Moaner for a true dance music experience and skip this bubbly synth poop - unless your into that kind of thing."
4,The Basic Trance CD,"I'd give this a five if I hadn't heard the Euphoria box sets, or the Northern Exposure series, (hell, half the good Euro trance that's been pumped out) but it is a good solid CD. Actually, I think this really deserves a three and a half, but I rounded up for the pricks who give it a one. I like more than 3 fourths of the songs, but it is kind of repetitive, and two of the songs are remixed on the same album...that's kind of weak (how about 2 more new ones?). Anyhow, I'd like more of an epic out of this album as it seems it was made for American radio at parts; however, it gets the job done. Save your money and download it."
3,"Beautiful, but simple","Maybe my expectations of an artist are to high. this cd is rightfully great. the songs are hum worthy, and great from beginig to end. I've listened to this cd umpteen times, and still haven't left it behind. But, the underlying truth, is that it is simple. The songs do not diverge from the basic sounds utilized in track one. Different melodies that are just avaeragely good, causing you to forget what track you are on, because the sounds are so similar. A formula that is has created a solid cd, but not one that isn't forgettable"
3,"Not bad, but I wish there was more variety","When I heard Robert Miles' ""Children"" on a trance compilation, I was blown away, and I assumed every track on his latest CD would be just as good. Unfortunately I was wrong. Most of the other tracks are very repetitive, and they all start to sound the same after a while. The beats are disappointingly simple and weak, and like the melodies, they sound about the same on every track. The female vocalist on ""Fable"" and the track after it grates on the nerves, too. However, I would buy this CD over again, just because it contains the full-length version of Children. That song remains one of my all-time favorites. And, to be fair, the non-vocals mix of ""Fable"" is quite pretty too. This album is for Miles fans only--the rest of us can find the one or two good tracks on compilations."
