3,A bit disappointed,"After hearing Alana Davis on the radio for some years I was eager to get my own CD. While I like the sound of the music behind her (which for the length of the CD becomes almost elevator-music-like), she has a very breathy, sighing quality to her voice in lieu of vocals. So much of it is humming or ""mmm-ing"" or ""yeahhhhhh"" without a real story behind it. After listening to it a dozen times, what I come away with is that a couple of the songs have some instrumentation that I like, and the rest kind of gets on my nerves. Again, the sound behind her is pleasant, if mostly atmospheric. I'd opt for Joss Stone instead if you're looking for a jazzy chanteuse."
3,What is it...,"...that draws me to her? Must be the voice. Her first album, Blame it on Me, is not necessarily extraordinary but her smoky singing is. One of the few covers I like better than the originial (I am a big Ani Difranco fan), ""32 Flavors"" is fun, sexy and deep. Fortune Cookie, from a novice's point of view, seems like more of the same to me. I was hoping she'd evolve a bit but I don't notice it. A good album to have for atmosphere but not necessarily a must-have."
4,"Good, But Lacks Spark","When I heard Alana's first CD in a store, the music grabbed me immediately. Many of the songs had urgency and grit underneath their lovely exteriors. This CD, while enjoyable, doesn't measure up to its predecessor. Maybe, like someone suggested, its more commercial, but I liked Alana the old way."
4,Nice,Alana's music is awesome and this latest doesn't disappoint -- although she could do without the Neptunes and the reggae-sound attempt (some things should be left alone).
5,Just as Good as the First,Alana Davis has an amazing range and doesn't produce music that sounds the same from one track to the next. Her musical compositions vary as well as the story lines of her lyrics. I purchased Blame it on Me as a gamble and was first in line for her next albumn. I was fortunate enough to see her live and she is like James Taylor - needs nothing but her voice and guitar to sound perfect.
4,Useful Reference Source for the Gospel of John,"This book takes a very scholarly approach to the fourth gospel. Brodie presents influences upon John, including Gnosticism, Hellenism, and Judaism. The first quarter of the book is historical, including the history of scholarship on the writing of the gospels. The middle half of the book, the most useful, can aid in the exegesis of the gospels if used with the Bible. Many tables illustrate the similarities of the gospels, and John's use of several sources, including the other gospels, the Pentateuch and Paul's letter to the Ephesians. The final part of the book is reference, including appendices, indexes, and an extensive bibliography. From Church & Synagogue Libraries 28 (July-Aug. 1994) 15."
1,My problems with this drive,"I have had numerous problems with this drive. It has successfully burned CDs 3 times since installation. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the device, switched around the cabling in my machine, updated my chipset, and updated Nero. Nothing works. I would strongly recommend that before buying this or any other Aopen DVD drive, you check Aopen's forums.I personally will not be purchasing another Aopen product. It isn't worth the hassle."
2,Landmarks in Humanities with Core Concepts DVD-ROM,"This is a textbook for a Humanities class. The text is not well written or well organized. I would have gotten nothing from this course without attending class and having the professor tell the stories of the people we are studying. The DVD-ROM is useless. It has no music, very little literature or artwork. If you click on a music icon, it redirects you to a web link to find the music. Some of the links do not work. If you have the chance to buy a book without the DVD and save money, do it. If you are in a position to choose which books to use for a course you teach, choose something else."
2,Book not what I wanted but Amazon was awesome!,"The description of the book stated that it included the supplemental materials (CD) but when I received it, there was no CD. I returned it to Amazon and they promptly refunded the full amount, no questions asked. Thanks, Amazon, for great customer service!!"
2,Really late,the only problem i had was that the book came really late. i had already had my first test by the time the book came in the mail. was upset about that!
3,item's condition,The item received came promptly and was in satisfactory condition. I would recommend this seller and use them again.
3,Signs of things to come,"Released in 1976, and with the return of Kevin, you can hear the brilliance that was to follow. Every song is solid. It is a shame that the sound quality is so poor, and as others have said, even flatter then the vinyl version (I wish mine was in better condition). Had the sound quality been that of say Hotel California, it would have gotten much more airplay. For some reason Gary's instrumental Flying Turkey Trot seems to have better sound then the rest. So who stepped into the engineering room when that was done? So then it looses a star just because of the sound quality."
2,Don't buy this CD!!!!,"The production is terrible and the songs sound flat. My favorite is ""Keep Pushin'"" and it just doesn't sound the way I was used to hearing it-so if you have your old vinyl-or the Decade of Rock N Roll LP-you're better off sticking to those versions.Trust me, the songs-not including the sappy ""Any Kind of Love"" and ""(Only A) Summer Love""-are great, but the sound is awful, at least, I was expecting it to sound better than it did."
2,LOOK WHO'S BACK,"Kevin markes his return to the group,after a three album gap in singing on their recordings, his first one out of the group, his vocals were recorded over, but the songs he wrote were still included. REO is not a great cd. It has some good songs, but the production on this outing is horrible, killing most of the songs. Keep Pushin, and (I Believe) Our Time is Gonna Come, are to very good songs. Any Kind of Love, and Summer Love deserve mention, showing that they are heading toward the ""big ballad"" days to come. Rest of this disk is weak, and does not show the promise of the Speedwagon ahead."
2,OOPS!!,"I left something out of my last review-I meant to say the 3rd verse of the song ""Keep Pushin'""-the brief guitar licks were left on on the CD!! The vinyl version is much better-at least, the version on the ""Decade of Rock 'n' Roll"" LP."
1,Office 97 plus 1.0 is a dud,"No clear install instructions. Found out on web site windows 98 tutorial had to be entered first, then kept getting i\o errors. Called tech support who sent me three pages of stuff to do before I could install. Did all that and still got i\o errors. Called back and they said it was my system that was causing the problems. News to me! Ive had NO other problems installing cds. I rate tech svcs unexperienced and a joke. Product is worthless without good tech support."
5,Classic Caiden!!!,"A novel I first read as a 6th grader, as good as every. THE book that inspired TV's Six Million Dollar Man TV show... a classic from a great american storyteller."
3,Not the TV 6 million dollar man,"This book was the idea behind the TV series. Only the book was alot more serious then the TV series, which by the end of it's run turned very campy.The book on the other hand plays Steve majors off as a James Bond type of spy with a few extra tricks. It was a good read. Also it was interesting to see what they thought we might be able to do with robotic body parts and how not so far we have come.Kinda makes you wonder if James Cameron didn't get inspiredfrom this book or the TV series to write his Terminator movie.This book is simaler to another book the Author wrote called Man-fac. Though in Man-fac, the person wears a robot suite that looks very much like a human.Who knows maybe in a hundred years we'll be talking about this book and how he predicted a few things like Mary Shelly did in Frankenstein [transplants]."
5,Best Ever!,"I first was loaned a copy of this book when I had been an officer for about two years. From the moment I started reading it I realized I was not alone in this field. I decided that this is the kind of officer I wanted to be. The book covers officer safety, criminal law, searches, and has a ton of great ""war stories""."
5,A great series,"This is my favorite Avengers team, Mrs. Peel and Mr. Steed. Together, Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee make the series. This series is very superb. Diana Rigg, an attractive woman, and Patrick Macnee, a good actor make this series. These 6 episodes are some of the best of the Avengers."
5,A Classic!,What a great series! Diana Rigg is wonderful and Patrick Macnee coplements her perfectly. Super!
3,Tribute to Frankie Ruiz,This concert was well intended and had many great singers performing some of Frankie Ruiz greatest hits. The production could have been better. If you are a hardcore fan of Frankie Ruiz you should purchase this DVD to add to your collection.
3,Cute but no sound,"I bought this toy and a few others for my son's 8th birthday--he was enamored by this one especially and put it on his wishlist. All of the birds that came in the shipment (I think there were five in all) were individually packed in plastic and perfect in appearance, but this one didn't make any sound when we squeezed it. All the others work perfectly, and because he was so excited, he wanted to keep it anyway, and for the price it really wasn't worth raising a bother about."
4,"Cuts great, with two caveats","I needed to cut some slots for tiny loose tenons in some doll furniture and this worked great on oak, cherry and maple. It doesn't clear the debris all that well, but it doesn't really clog up around the bit itself and some digging with a enter punch cleared it right out. Keep in mind it is small and a bit brittle so don't push it or try to go too deep in one pass on a really tough piece of wood. I had no problems cutting up to 1/4"" deep even in hard maple but I broke one cutting 3/8"" deep in cherry when I tried to rush. Up to the point it snapped it was cutting just fine for several inches so I'm not entirely sure what the final straw was."
1,Cheap photocopy,"A valuable title that could be very useful. However the reproduction is so light (and reduced by approximately 40%) that it's barely legible, and the illustrations--the point of the book--lack any significant detail. There's no reason this couldn't have been done better. Save your money and search for it used."
3,Good solid dumb fun,"4 Nice solid classic SciFi movies and at a surprisingly reasonable price! All without doubt fairly B grade stuff, but good fun nevertheless. I'd recommend watching these all in one sitting with a good group of friends and a stack of junk food. Good fun way to blow an evening and enjoy the great quotables.Of the four, my fav would have to be Death Machine - go those snapping jaws of death!"
1,Lesbians love these shoes.,"I know that people say that they are so comfortable. But you wanna know what makes me feel comfortable? Well, i'm going to tell you, not wearing ugly shoes, thats what. I go to lesbian bars all of the time and I see people wearing these things and I can't help but ask myself ""why can't I be straight? why, god? why?"""
5,A Hit!,"This was my gift to my four-year-old nephew, who is just mad about knights. He and his eight-year-old sister had a grand old time coming up with different story lines featuring the dragon and knight. The dragon is large and sturdy and the knight sits well on his back, and all pieces seem to be standing up to some really rough and tumble play. I would definitely recommend this, even if you do not have the castle series, which my nephew does not own but which does not seem to have diminished his enjoyment of the knight and dragon.It's a pity they don't include a picture of the dragon on this site. Disregard the misleading picture of a knight on a horse that is currently displayed."
1,What A Disappointment,"I passed on buying this album when it was first released in 1977. I was very much looking forward to this re-issue. I was very disappointed in what I heard. The music was bland, boring, extremely moody and melancholy without a hook in sight. The majority of songs are slow piano driven ballads which nearly put me to sleep. The vinyl pressing is terrible. The 3 records are warped and off center with many pops, clicks, crackles and distortion."
5,Excellent,The best album produced by any of the beach boys during the 1970s. Full bodied music with lyrics to match. Dennis comes out from behind Brian's shadow with this album. Pacific Ocean Blue & Rainbow are my personal favouries. The opening of Pacific Ocean Blue makes you sit up and pay attention and appreciate the listening experince. A sheer pleasure;unfortunatley due to short supply of the CD only a few are able to experience such talent.If only his second album was completed!!! Would someone plesae rerelease this Cd!!!!!
4,The Problem of Cultural Origins and Apt Metaphors,"This work is Nietzsche's first major publicaiton. In it, he is not yet the philosopher he would become a decade later. ""The Birth of Tragedy"" presents an interesting account of the tragedy of the Greeks--its origins and function. Nietzsche's contention seems to be that, in addition to being rational and rationalistic, the Greeks were strong enough to face the irrational, or Dyonisian, element of life. And they used tragedy to embrace that necessary element. As a powerful metaphor, Nietzsche's account of tragedy is compelling, but I do not know whether this can be regarded as the real cultural origin of the tragedy."
5,Another nice book...,"... for a very cheap price! If you are looking for a fancy edition with notes, comments, and whatnot then this is not for you. But if you just want to read Nietzche's book as it is, then with 3 dollars or so, there you have it!"
5,Great buy,I have just learned that chakras exist so I purchased this item to gain more knowledge about this part of my life that I did not know was there. The item is in excellent condition. I'm anxious to get started.
4,Chakra CD,I already have this CD but I bought this as a gift for my massage therapist because she needed a new one.
5,Simply Sensational Work from Steven Halpern,"How can you not love this? After listening to just 6 tracks and 20 minutes of material, I feel well balanced and stress-free. The music was truly like being in heaven. I recommend this to anyone that is in need of mental and spirtual healing. I have had lots of stress, and I've been depressed so much, but that's why I decided to order this CD and several others. I'm in need of change and it's starts here with this fantastic CD. I think music of this sort is the key to changing lives for better in every aspect. Kudos to Steven Halpern for creating a relaxating masterpiece."
5,A Divine Attraction to this CD,"When I purchased this CD in a store, I was a attracted to it's cover art and the fact it worked with one's chakras. Not realizing it, when I was becoming attuned for level 2 reiki with a reiki master, this was the CD she used on me for all 5 sessions. Six months after those sessions I purchased this CD. For the past year I have listened to this CD nearly every night, on repeat. I bring it to work to relax and destress to whenever I have a break. It is just amazing. It is my number one CD to listen to. My friends have really enjoyed this CD when they listen to it, and whenever I work on somebody for energy healing / relaxation with Reiki they love this CD as well.I have purchased two other CD's by Steven Halpern and thoroughly enjoy them too (""Self-Esteem"" & ""Music for Healing Mind, Body & Soul"").You will want to carry this CD around with you everywhere, even put it onto your IPod or any other MP3 player to listen to whereever you may go."
4,Like soaking in a bathtub...,"Listening to this is like soaking in a bathtub wherever you listen to it. You know that feeling. I listen to it alot when going to sleep. I have extreme difficulty normally, but with this I am out in 10-15 minutes. I also feel revitalized after its use and can almost feel the effects on my chakra's while each is stimulated by it's own unique song. Only problem, the ""melody"" is almost the same. Maybe that is the goal though."
2,Wakes Me Up,I have seven Steve Halpern albums that I sometimes play at night to go to sleep. I have awaken more than once while the the Chakra Suite is playing. It may work for meditation but it is a D- for sleep.
2,CD,"I absolutely love this CD. It is so relaxing to listen to and I am enjoying it very much. Received it in only a few days. It was well-packaged and I will continue to shop at Amazon in the future.Sincerely, M.J. Sundstrom"
3,Not my favorite,"I errored when I ordered this, it is not my favorite Halaprin. It;s nice but not what I had in mind."
3,japanese cooking,"it's a fantastic book . it helps indeed one to have a real glimpse of the japanese cuisine. it is best to have a backround in japanese cuisine, it makes it easier to understand.but if you don't have it, you can still get it.it's an easy lecture.... i recomand it. max, bucharest , romania."
4,Lengthy but good.,"A very long and in depth book on Japanese cooking. But if you want to truly learn about the origins of why and how things are done, it is a must have. This is not your basic take off the shelf and look up a recipe cook book. It is a cook book/history book."
5,A Classic on my kitchen shelf up there with Julia,"I got this book as a wedding present (I believe i have had it for over 20 years now). The hardcover copy. It is full of cultural and gastronomical information and the recipes are clear and correct. I consider this book to be one of the greatest books on cooking in general and Japanese culture/food in particular. I continue to refer to or use it every week. If you are interested in international cultures and cuisines (as I am), this is one of the ""must have"" books."
4,Cookbook for serious cooks,"This was meant to be a gift for my daughter studying Japanese. It is a cookbook for serious cooks - no photos, just recipes. Some of the recipes were more than simple. I ended up returning it because my daughter is an occasional cook."
5,The Best Japanese Cookbook.,I have never seen a better Japanese cookbook. My copy is about twenty years old and I use it regularly.
4,comprehensive,"I found this book a bit dry... It seems to be some history/some cooking which i usually like alot. But the writing didnt seem to have a spark to me... it read more like a text book. a school book, maybe. i read it through but i didnt find myself enjoying the experience as much as i would have liked to. The recipes seemed authentic and looked good but i wasnt *excited* enoguh by the book to try them...i can see using this more as a reference..others may feel different tho"
1,Awful fit on Chrysler Lebaron,"This item fits many different vehicles, so there WILL be additional work in the form of sawing or scoring and snapping off the extra tabs to make it fit your vehicle. I use the term ""fit"" loosely. After carefully cutting away the indicated tabs, it still didn't fit the Chrysler Lebaron for which it was purchased. I had to cut away additional tabs in order to get it to even bolt on, and even then it's slightly twisted. The only thing really holding it firmly against the dashboard is the radio itself after it was locked into the frame. I would NOT buy this again or recommend this brand."
2,Inferior paper quality,"The content of the book is good, but the paper quality is very very bad. So, it deserves the two star rating"
3,English - Telugu Dictionary,Telugu is one of the famous language in india. This dictionary contains the meaning and examples for each word.
5,car collector 4984,"Iv'e liked Diablos since I was a kid and as an adult, it was a must have for my collection. Not sure how much fun it is because i don't intend to play with it. It's a collectors piece."
3,Could be much finer and a bit smoother,The standard nib size is too large and the ink is too thick for quick accurate writing. Will continue to look for the perfect cartridge for my Wacom Bamboo Duo Stylus. Unfortunately the original included cartridge was unlabeled-it was a fantastic cartridge.
4,Kinda small for the price,"Since I have a Lamy multifunction writing instrument, I have no alternative but to buy these refills, even though they have a low ink capacity sorta like printer cartridges. The ink flows nicely and the point is smooth, good enough for signing checks but too expensive for long essay writing."
3,Careful... (3.5 stars),"For everyone who enjoyed ""Rounds"" and is considering ""Pause"" in hopes it will deliver on the same level, I urge you to spend your money elsewhere. This CD is good, but disappointing when compared to a great record like ""Rounds"". The structure and sound of the albums are so similar that ""Pause"" can't help but sound like an inferior version of ""Rounds,"" which completely expands upon every one of ""Pause""'s ideas. This is not to say that ""Pause"" is not an enjoyable listen, but after giving it a few spins, I have had no desire to keep it in any kind of rotation in my collection. Why not spend the money on something more worthwhile? Some superior albums in the same general genre are: Delarosa and Asora's ""Agony Pt. 1"", Dntel's ""Life Is Full of Possibilities,"" and Mouse on Mars' ""Idiology""..."
3,Searching for glitches,"3 1/2Four Tet's signature laptop cut-ups are on display throughout his sophomore release, even if it is not in full force. Compelling samples, articulated break-beats, and hypnotic production all dot Pause with a unique electronic elegance, though Hebden still sounds like he is searching for more personality and not fully ready to break away from similar influences."
4,"okay, okay- i was a little premature in my observations","As my first one star review stated- i thought this album was a complete waste of time but i feel that i was a little premature in my verdict and that i deserved to give it another chance.I basically left it on play and repeat and after a few hours of relaxed, not to critical listening certain songs started to pop out and grab my attention. My verdict was further cemented when i heard one of the tracks on a advert which i thought was brilliant.This cd isn't perfect but their are at least 4 or 5 damn good tracks. The lesson i have learned form this experience- don't judge an album or song until you have had time to properly evaluate it."
2,"tries to be, falls short","I bought this album purely on the reviews. I had never actually heard the sounds of Four Tet before. After listening to the album about a dozen times, I can hear bits and pieces of Arovane and other IDM labels, but Four Tet fails to develop any of these sounds to any meaningful capacity. I wouldn't buy this album again, now that I've heard it. Of course, YMMV."
1,PAUSE TAKES ALL THE BAD PARTS FROM OTHER GENRE'S,"Man this is a poor effort, in this case minimalist means a minimalist result. On the cover, 4 magazines like Mojo etc. praised this album very highly. After track 6 had finished i had enough and was wondering how much the record company had paid the magazines, but you can't say an album is bad if you've only half heard it so i went on. Track 7 provided much welcome relief- a track that finally had some presence and feeling. Track 8 could have been good but the vocals said something stupid and repetitve which ruined it. After much hard work i managed to pluck out tracks 1, 4 and 10. They where nothing special as far as my collection goes but relative to this lame effort they where pretty decent.This is a worthy effort for a backing album for a restaurant or chill-out bar but consumers could do much better. Try artists like Cujo, Clifford Gilberto, Amon Tobin, Bent and Faze Action for a start."
1,Neccessary Snideness,"Kenickie used to be a punk rock band who played cool punk rock songs. However, they considered punk rock to be smelly and beneath them, seeing pop music as the way forward. Trouble is, they're absolutely sh*xt at doing pop songs, as you will discover if you buy this record for what appears to be a grossly inflated price. The band split up a couple of weeks ago and the singer is going to present some programme on BBC digital TV, leading me to predict that she will be Paula Yates in five years' time. Just you wait and see."
2,waste of money,"this was supposed to be a CD about reducing driving fear. Instead it was an entire tape of waves hitting a shore. I felt like I shoud be swimming. When I attempted to return it, the seller did not respond. Do not waste your money"
5,"""Lives up to its name""","Very good lubricant, and truly a product who's name has a matching rating! Came very quickly and the color matches with my brass trombone."
1,There's a sucker born every minute.,"The authors provide no evidence or support of any kind for their speculations, which could be very harmful if people follow their suggestions. It is sad that there are so many disreputable people who write books on fantasy topics like ""energy healing"" just to make money. Have they no sense of morality? Do they believe their own hype? Can they not find any more useful and ethical way to earn a living?"
3,Elippse White porcelian Gravy Boat and Saucer,Bought as a gift. Very plain and larger than expected. utilitarian appearance is not very attractive. Poor value for the price.
2,Family genealogists don't miss this one on Rebecca Cornell,"I didn't particularly like the book, and if the person who died hadn't been an ancestor, I don't think I would have finished reading the book. I don't think the author proved anything.But for family genealogists who have Rebecca Cornell in their lineage, the book is a must. The book provides good background and color of the time period, including many family facts that can be used in expanding your knowledge of the Cornell and related families. I was able to add lots of additional information to my Family Maker. So as a family genealogist, it provided a wealth of little known information and was worth the price---but as an analysis of a killing---I felt it was pure conjecture."
5,The was my 11th great grandmother,This is a really interesting story and glimpse into life here 200 years ago. A son was convicted of his mother's word on the testimony of a ghost. He was hung for it. Fortunately I am descended from a different one of her sons. :)
3,Killed Strangely:the death of rebecca cornell,Author Elaine f crane did a fine job with this family related subject and with connecting Lizzie Borden relationships. Clark F. Cornell
1,Wrtitten Strangely,"This book dares to be called an historical work. It should be deemed a fantasy. Rarely does the author clearly articulate reasons for her sweeping and farcical assumptions. When she describes Lizzie Borden as proof positive that the Cornells were genetically disposed to get angry enough to kill, she clearly crosses the line. Ms. Crane thanks her husband for his help by stating that he was her partner in crime. It's truly a crime that this book was ever published."
5,Superhuman Mclaughlin,"To learn to play Indian Music is like training to become a Jedia In Star Wars. It takes 50 years at least to develope some technique in Indian music. However John had only been playing for over 20 years when he recorded this album, and most of it wasn't even Indian. He turly is a Superhuman. On this Album he demonstrates his superpowers. The First track is Intense and other two are mind blowing. A must have Album."
3,mixed bag,"Classical Indian (and Indian-type) music should be listened with introspection. It is difficult to do that with this live CD, since the audience is of the ""rock concert"" influence. That is, they whoop it up after each solo making a distraction. Too bad.The music itself is good, but a mixed bag, aurally. First, the guitar does not have the sustain of, say, a sitar. Thus, it sounds curious in the context. Also, Indian instruments have an organic depth to them which the recording does not convey. It is rather on the dry side.To contrast I pulled out some old World-Pacific Lps and listened. The sound coming from Shankar and company is much more 3 dimensional. Also, Shankar is just as ""fast"" (if that is what you are looking for) and more melodic. McLaughlin is like a lightening strike, whereas Shankar is like the all present sun."
3,"A good CD, but...","If you haven't heard Shakti before, I would recommend starting elsewhere. Get Handful Of Beauty or Natural Elements first. John Mclaughlin is a great guitarist, but he is not a master of Indian music; nowhere is that more obvious than on this cd. I dont care for his guitar's tone here either. There are moments of brilliance, and the other members perform well, but the group does not come close to the brilliance they display on later recordings."
5,Intensely spritual,"This music is, simply put, some of the most intense anyone will ever here. ""Joy"" is sheer virtuosity striving for the height of spiritual awareness. There is meditation on this album, and scintillating interplay between the Indian musicians and JMcL.These musicians have combined the Hindustani 36-note scale and classical Indian harmonics and jazz/blues modal scales. It's really fresh and almost frighteningly startling to hear. A lot of people say their favorite music is intense, but Shakti really means it. It's amazing that this music even exists, and yet it's not so well-known."
5,A mesmirising music that transcends words.,"The fast phased music that reaches down into the spine is mind blowing. Very few cds will give the after effect as much as this music gives. If I got an A grade in a course that invloves hard-core mathematical concepts (Topology), then, i guess i must dedicate that to L Shankar and John Mclaughlin. As a first timer to jazz as well as to L Shankar, I switched on this music just to keep me from falling asleep. But, at the end of the music, I was suddenly alive and kicking."
3,"Simple but concise,but there are better","This book is a good purchase for someone with basically zero knowledge on the red army in WW 2, it gives you a simple introduction, and overall description of the state of the different service branches just before Operation Barbarossa, a description of weapons, uniforms and overall doctrine and tactics. nothing you cannot find in far more detailed in other books and the Web, but for the price is nice. The color plates are very nice and detailed. A good one for the beginner."
2,"A good player, mine would not record","I bought this from a competitor, wish I had bought from Amazon.We have had it for a few months, have never been able to get it to record.The book says 1 year warranty. Philips would not honor the warranty, because they said, they no longer had in their data base, even though we have only owned it for a few months.After many headaches and shipping expense, and a restocking charge, the competition is taking it back.We are going to buy a Panasonic or Sony now"
1,Does not record DVD+RW,"I had high hopes for this device, but unfortunately it does not recognize DVD+RW discs as advertised. I tried several brands of DVD+RW media including the Philips DVD+RW that came with the recorder. The recorder gets stuck with 'reading' on the display and never lets you erase or record. When it gets stuck in this state, you can't even bring up the menu. It's either a broken design or crap quality (defective). Either way, if you want a DVD recorder that actually records DVDs, look elsewhere."
5,Goes flawlessly with Flip Flop Spanish,"I can't get over how well this line of books goes with the lessons laid out in Flip Flop Spanish: Ages 3-5: Level 1. I used this book after the chapter on counting, and of course my kids already knew the word for Dog, so it was just a wonderful reinforcer. What a FUN way to review!I'm already be recommending it to all my students, and plan to use it in my Spanish class for 3 and 4 year olds this week!"
2,hard to read,hard to read 10 different barking sounds in 10 pages. kind of wish it had words or somewhat of a story line
5,This is great stuff....,I have problems with splitting nails and this is a great product to give strength to nails in need of help. I'd buy it again.
5,Received in tip top shape,My daughter was very happy at Christmas. Great item. I will buy me a pair very soon. Very warm inside.
5,Cozy and Comfy,"Perfectly warm boots to run around in. I wear normally 6 1/2 to 7 but ordered kids size 4 (which is 6) and it fits perfect.everyone said to order little smaller so it will fit tight and they are right. its better than sliding back and forth and also it will stretch as well. Love this boots, so glad that I bought these instead of cheaper imitation ones."
2,Way too big,These boots were way too big. Im a size 7.5 and I ordered a size 6. I should have ordered a size 5. Im also afraid these boots may be a really good knockoff. The sticker proves that its not real and the box didnt even come with a little brochure about the shoe. I would not suggest to buy these boots. Im really mad and Im returning these boots. Im buying these from a different user.
5,Kids Classic Uggs,"My (favorite) granddaughter wanted another pair of Uggs for her Christmas gift this year, (I'd bought her a pair last year, as well.) So we sat down at my computer to view styles/colors etc and made her selection. They arrived in very timely fashion, and were exactly what she wanted. Since she was happy, I was happy. Another seamless transaction abetted by Amazon. My thanks."
5,Very good quality and fast shipping,"This quality product from amazon met all our expectations. The boots arrived in mint condition, packaged in original UG box and my daughter was very thrilled to see it. Shipping was quick too and came in a day earlier. Pleased with the purchase"
1,not cut from the same pattern,"they don't fit like the other colors.. i can't get my foot into them....i have black, beige & chestnut & they fit fine... the grey are a very bad fit"
1,disappointed in uggs,they make your foot look big and your ankle look so small and they are hard to get on your foot.
4,"awesome, except they do scuff","I LOVE these Uggs for my kids. They are super warm, super comfy and very easy to get on and off. They do tend to get a little ""worn"" looking on the front toe of the boot after awhile. But, what do you expect with kids running and playing in them. ; ) These are a must have for us during the winter. If your willing to pay a little extra for your kiddos shoes these are a perfect fit. = )"
4,Purple Uggs,The product was as described at a great price. We just need to purchase the weatherization and care kit now.
1,Defective,I bought these for my daughter and when she put them I noticed the label on one boot was upside down. These boots are expensive and I feel this error is unacceptable.
2,Not toddler boots,"These are adult size 6 boots, not toddler size. What a pain. I like to order online but this is one of those times when in store would be better! I love Uggs so at least gave 2 stars as the product is not the problem here!"
3,Ugg,Love the Uggs but they came with a small mark on the toe and they smell like a pasture. Not sure where they were stored.
3,nice shoes,"I loved these boots and they go with anything, but they hurt my feet! I injured my foot running last spring and when i wear them for the whole day at school, my foot starts to hurt where I injured it. If you have feet problems, then i might not encourage you to buy them."
2,Size is misleading,"It looks great! But my toddler will not be able to wear them in the next 3 years I guess... This is no toddler size. I had a hard time figuring out the size, and it turns out I actually haven't been able to figure it out. And I haven't pulled myself together to return it yet. It's just a pain."
1,Shamful price. Shameful exploitation of Fogelbergs death.,I have been listening to and buying Dan Fogelbergs music and songbooks since 1974. I know how much the songbooks cost. What an insult to his legacy that you would put up a songbook of his for this much money. Shame on you.
2,Content did not live up to its introduction,"Unfortunately I purchased 7 copies of this book for a coaching program I was doing before I had read it. The cover information and introduction were intriguing.However, I found the content thin and failing to deliver on the promises laid out in the introduction of the book as well as the introduction of each chapter. I liked ideas that they told me they would tell me about; the authors delivered thin regurgitated material."
2,.....,"ITS NOT EVEN BLUE!!!!its practically frickin clear and it looks like someone but blue food coloring in it....oh and it squirts out wayyy to fast, it feels like im drowning my valves in it.... amazon sucks for buying valve oil, never ordering again"
5,Great sledge`,"I've been using this to drive a wedge into wood for splitting and it works great. The handle is very tough; I've hit it a number of times full force on some logs, and I can barely even tell.If this thing ever wears out I'd happily buy another just like it."
4,CDB,I had the album from when it first came out but had to have the c/d very spendy but it's in good shape.
3,For CDB fans,This is very good Charlie Daniels Album but it has some weak spots that only big fans can enjoy. The best cut on the album is Billy the KID. High Lonesome is another favorite of mine. Carolina is a type of song Charlie fans know well were he tells the listener why he loves his home. The LP had a differant track line and side A was the best side of a CDB record and side B contained the weaknesses. CDB fans will like this album and appreciate the effort in finding it.
4,Not her best,"For anyone who's read her ""Simplyseries, this one will be a let down. It's still Balogh. Her writing is terrific, her imagination great, but I didn't feel satisfied when I finished it."
1,sickening description of violence done to heroine,"If you want your stomach turned by a sickening description of the heroine being object raped, this is the book for you."
2,a wasted opportunity,"For all the talent here, it's just shocking they couldn't come up with at the very least an engaging cover version. This just goes on and on and on, and no, that's NOT a good thing. What is especially galling is that the original version of Break 4 Love by Raze is a hundred times better than this, despite having been recorded more than a decade earlier, and for probably a whole lot less money. A wasted opportunity."
3,Deep freeze&#65533;. 1979 to 2008,"I read this book back in 1979 when I was a kid, and now for the second time when by chance I spotted it in a used book store. The book was written about a wealthy persons life in 1978, and through cryogenics this person awakens in 2008. The author had a vivid imagination of what 2008 would be like, and he's not on the mark on any of his predictions.The story revolves around Dennis Mintion, a person who has money but could not find or buy himself a cure for Hays syndrome (deadly disease). So he did the next best thing, he had himself frozen until a cure came along. He was froze in 1979 and thawed in 2008. The problems he thought he had left some 40 years earlier were still there--- the aftermath of a grasping wife, greed, crime and jealousy.Overall not a bad book.. Was much better some 20 years ago. I did find humor in the authors predictions of the future. Might be best for a high school student."
5,A Must-Read for Anyone Involved in Email Marketing,"I read this book because our company has been disappointed with the results from our email marketing efforts to date. Unlike many business books out there that can seem generic and ""fluffy,"" I was very pleased to discover detailed recommendations and examples of best practices throughout the book on key topics such as building our list, crafting our content, and ensuring that our email is being viewed by our customers. The book gave us specific and actionable recommendations for how to improve our results, and we are already beginning to see the improvements! I recommend this book to anyone involved in email marketing."
4,A good book for Email marketing!,"This book provides a very comprheisve coverage about email marketing, such as permission-based list generation, the optimization techniques about the subject line, email content, coupon, etc, campaign metric montoring such as open rate, CTR, bounce rate, etc. Unlike other books, this books is right to the points withouth unncessary stories or lengthy and verbose paragraphs used to strech the length of the book. A very good book for people who have little time to read!"
4,What a help,This book was truly a great help. I needed some ideas for the designs of my monthly newsletter. I am not a creative guy so this book was very helpful!
2,Disappointing,"I've played the original SNES Lufia I and II, they were fun and entertaining. This game is a bit monotonaous. basically you go around and train, fight a boss. The plot is weak and the game grows boring after a while. I bought the game because I was going on a trip and needed somehting to do. I got bored with it 1/3 or the way though. I'm a die-hard RPG fan so this one is just plain disapointing"
4,Very Pleased,This game is great! It came very quickly and is very fun to play. I was worried that I would not like it but the more I play it the more fun it is! It is most like the Lufia 2 game for the SNES. I highly recommend this game if you like the other Lufia series games.
2,This is a good rpg...er...no,"After having played such greats as Chrono cross/trigger and final fantasy, this game just doesn't compare. The story line is really slow, with battles taking too much time. The gameplay is fun with big towns to explore and many buildings to enter and so forth, but it doesn't make up for the fact that this is a very slow game. I bought this game 2 weeks ago and started playing it for awhile, and then set it down and forgot about it. I am very dissapointed in it as an rpg"
2,Disappointed,"Having played other Lufia games and numerous RPGs I must say that I'm disappointed. The game is of little challenge and has few surprises. You basically walk down a path, find a problem, fight a monster, go to a new city. Normally, I'm a person who sits and plays a game until I defeat it, but less than 1/3 of the way through the game I totally lost interest.The only interesting part is that you can capture and train monsters, but training them can be quite annoying when some love running away in battle and have late evolutions.I gave the game two stars because the whole capturing monsters gave a bit of variety, but the plot is weak, and the game is boring."
2,'Gaia' is a depressing journey,"Highly over-rated, self-penned and self-conscious album by the lovely Olivia. The making of this album was more therapeutic for her, written and recorded during a rough period in her life, than as an artistic success. She just doesn't have enough songwriting talent to fill an entire album. That's not to say she can't compose a gem or two, which she does nicely with ""No Matter What You Do"" and ""The Way of Love."" Still, this dreary album is a downer in tone. She's a talented lady but, unfortunately, ""Gaia"" too closely reflects her bad times. This is a trip that only die-hard fans will want to take."
2,Self Indulgent,"Olivia had gone through a lot in her life before this album, and the ""getting it out of her system"" process shows. The music is competent, with one reasonable track but the feeling it leaves is boredom. We've glad you're with us Olivia, the world will be a darker place without you, but this album casts little light unless you can find personal meaning in it. Thankfully I cannot, and therefore it gathers dust on my shelves."
3,Alina,"The movie Alina was OK to watch, the acting and story was good and I consider it worth watching, still a good choice."
3,Not as good as the first one,"I was really looking forward to this book, but I was a tad disappointed. It started out great but it pittered out in the end. Still a good read, it was awesome to get a sense of what X'endrik is all about and the geography, architecture, history, etc.Daine is one tough dude! If you thought he was ""Rambo"" in the first one, then wait until this."
3,Mass Media Law-Textbook,"As textbooks are essential for college classes it is good to know that some textbooks are great while others not so great.Mass Media and Law is one of those that hold a wealth of information that journalism students need, however it is poorly designed so it takes forever to read."
1,Student text -- Why so much??,"I do think authors of student text books take advantage of the fact that a large group of students will be forced to buy this text by a professor who doesn't care about the hefty price tag. I don't know if others have attempted libraries... but they're usually out of the text books you need if you don't check them out a month in advance.This price was painful to me, being a student. I think professors are just as able to teach a course successfully in class without assigning books such as this one to their students.And... FYI, this book has a serious ZZZ factor. I paid for the class. I sure hope the professor is a better read."
1,Worthless material. No insight at all.,"This book is definitely not worth the price. Not even worth $5. There is no insight to cool effect techniques here. Basic common knowledge or simple experimentation tips. I returned it very disappointed. Also, shoddy printing job."
4,Expect what the title tells you,"While the book gives you inroads into various options available with SQL Server 2005, it lacks depth in almost all topics covered, but then you would not expect something else from a Starter Kit. Recommended for beginners, if you have some experience, choose another book."
1,The book was useless,"I am an Access user and now use SQL. The book was useless. The title of the book is SQL Server 2005 Express Edition, not Visual Basic Manual. ONLY the first chapter covers SQL, the rest of the book is Visual Basic. I am very upset with the false and misleading title and back-cover description. Shame on WROX."
5,Inspired!,"Michel Roux is without question a giant in his line of work, being a professional chef myself I found that his book ""Sauces"" is one of a kind , very well written, equally usefull to pros as well as amateur cooks. Word cannot describe the passion, skill and ispiration with which this book was written. A job well done!!"
4,sauce,"I haven't had too much time to make these recipes, but what I did make turned out great. Everybody enjoyed them. like most things, you do need time and patience. I have Michel's other two boks; eggs, and pastry. Which are excellent."
3,So-so sauce book,Somehow I was just hoping for something more from this book. I have owned it for a year and have never been inspired to cook anything from it.
5,Great Dark Trance Synth Pop,"Excellent CD of Dark Wave with superb Vocals. Pick it up - you will be surprised. Shocking that no one has written a review. Another great thing about this cd is there is long extended versions added on. It is like Trance meets Zoth Ommeg and has a nice edge that makes Lights their own entity. Vocals in both German and English - I highly recommend - Other great bands are AND ONE, Project Pitchfork, De Vision, Seabound,IMATEM"
3,Fly Away - The Myndy K Experience,US Maxi Single Track Listing for :'FLY AWAY' - THE MYNDY K EXPERIENCE1) Radio Edit - 3:452) E&G;'s Epic Mix - 12:583) Extended Mix - 7:324) Dub Mix - 6:305) Dear Alice Mix - 5:302001
3,Little Bit Too Big,"I bought this with the knowledge of knowing it was a very large toy. I've been able to successfully use other dildos of very large size before with relative ease, provided there was enough lube. However, this one is just a bit too big of a stretch for me (no pun intended). It's about 8.5"" in circumference, probably a bit more. It's HUGE... and you will need A LOT of lube even to get it to get in a little bit. Probably not exactly suitable for anal usage, however I figure with enough practice eventually I can write a more detailed review. However, I'd rate it at about a 3, just a bit too big for my comfort."
5,Filled to max!!!,"Think one word truly answers this product OM@#$%%!!!! The picture doesn't do it justice, it really is huge, not for the novice. Can say i'm happy with it, could only take in half the length, but know I will later on :-)) a must have for the ones that are in the need of total fullness."
4,HUGE,"Seriously. wide. Definite size queen toy. The balls are silly, but the bottom has a nice suctiony quality that will make it stick to smooth surfaces, though not to walls.Great club to beat people with. He's heavy and can leave a bruise."
2,Eh,"This picture in no way really represents the product. I was an eager beaver to try it, but it was freaking huge. Do yourself and read the dimensions. The penis head is bigger than the shaft which is kinda stupid. It's okay but not anything special."
2,poor quality,"The Koch video print is very poor quality, not even normal DVD level. Looks like SD off a TV channel. I doubt the Alpha version is any better, judging from dozens of their discs that I have seen. The movie is not a tenth as sexy as the still photos that were published in Playboy (in which you can see why they probably did opt to release it in B&W), and whenever the girls actually start to strip, the film abruptly cuts away. However, European films of this era were frequently censored for US release and this is probably an intact version of an American print. It's a cheap film, but interesting for the number of real talents seen early in their careers. If you want to see why Jayne Mansfield was provocative (in her non-studio films), better to get Promises, Promises, the stills for which got even Playboy in trouble (and the stills are mostly from the film, which isn't true in THTH)."
2,great Mansfield in poor movie,"Well made by the great Terence Young,with an interesting supporting cast, (including Christopher Lee and Barbara Windsor) But the film is just toobrittish for my taste,and the uninspired,boring script kills the film...but,if you are at all interested in Jane Mansfield,then you,ll have to see this one.Regarded by most chritics as a bad actress,she is here probably giving the most convinsing performance of her career.She was always beutiful and charming,but here she is also a great actress!To bad the movie does not deserve her.Christian Karlsson,Sweden"
1,Too Hot To Handle,Movie was what I expected but it should have been in color but my copy showed in b&w and transfer was of poor quality.
5,TWO EARS UP!!!!,"I heard an acoustic version of ""Torn"" on a radio show and came to find it was Ednaswap. I was so impressed by Anne Preven's voice and the rest of the song samples, I bought the CD. All of the songs are are very good- and at least four radio-worthy. If this band doesn't get more air time, it would be a disservice to music and listeners everywhere. My only disppointment is that none of the songs- except ""Without Within""- let loose Preven's intense, powerful, husky voice. Exceptional!!"
2,"Ednaswap is really good, this CD is kind of a disappointment","While Ednaswap's previous release, Whacko Magneto, is a masterpiece, thier third and final full-length, Wonderland Park, fails by comparison. The unbridaled energy, originality, and fresh takes on classic and alternative rock are replaced by what sounds like an attempt to gain mainstream acceptance. While the self-titled debut and Whacko albums rock out in a manner comparable to Jane's Addiction meets Joan Jett, Wonderland reminds me more of the corporate written-for-radio produced by The Matrix songwriting team. That's not to say that Wonderland Park is without merits, because Ednaswap is a very good band and they make great music and songs. However, this is quite a bit removed from their previous releases and a letdown after such an incredible album as Whacko. I'll keep this CD in my collection, but I recommend making this the final CD you buy by this band after you've worn out the other two. My favorite tracks are: 747, Back on the Sun."
2,Not What I Expected,"Love Archie, but was sorely dissappointed by this CD. There are only two tracks that I really enjoy, and a couple that were truly awful.I feel I am open-minded enough to listen to just about anything, but some of this was far too self-indulgent and downright sappy.Not what I expect from this guy."
2,Not digging it,"I'm a huge fan of Archie Shepp. His albums ""The Magic of Ju-Ju,"" ""Mama Too Tight"" and ""Fire Music"" are all classics, and I was hoping this would be more of the same--wild, free jazz of the spheres.Unfortunately, this album is more like Albert Ayler's ""New Grass,"" where vocalists (bad ones) really just ruin the album. I hate to say anything bad about anything by Archie Shepp, because I think he's one of America's great treasures, totally underexposed and underappreciated. But ""Attica Blues"" is not where I would start my exploration of his genius."
1,Cute but useless,"Bought these for my son's computer and was completely unhappy with them. The sound was scratchy, the volume low, and the sound would cut in and out. Since he loved monkeys, we unplugged the darned things and just used them as decorations for his room and found a decent set of ""normal looking"" computer speakers. Don't waste your money."
2,Not worth it!,"I bought this as a present for a friend of mine for her computer at work. When we plugged it in, there was so much static you couldn't hear the music. I looked at the instructions and it turns out you can't put it near a computer monitor. What's the point of getting them then?!!"
3,Monkeys look kinda cheap!,"Speakers work just fine. I expected them to look better than what they did. The boy I bought them for thought they were great, just cause they were Monkeys!"
4,Les Paul endures for the ages.,"I've been a Les Paul fan for many years, and even have a 78 of his Les Paul Trio. The video ""Chasing Sound"" is an excellent biography of a legendary man, musician, and inventor. From his childhood, to the present day, this dvd tells his story in his own voice. Talking about Mary Ford and their meeting is a bonus as well. It doesn't disappoint the old fans and will introduce new ones. Live on Les Paul!."
5,Les Paul - inventor and musician,"This is a well-told fascinating documentary of Les Paul AND the history of the development of electric guitars and multi-track recording. It will mean a lot to those who listened to music in the 1950's and to those who are part of the current music scene who are interested in music sound origins. Plus, the viewer meets an amazing human being."
5,Not to be missed!,"Whether a musician or not, this documentary on the life and work of Les Paul is one of the finest musical biographies I have seen.By charting Paul's career from the earliest days, it also covers a big part of the history of country music and jazz, and is one of the fewsuch documents that shows just how closely entwined country instrumental music and jazz actually are.The show is virtually music from beginning to end, even with the talking heads illustrating points.The extras are worth the price of admission alone... with a wonderful 90 minute concert at a New York jazz club, up close and personal showing how, at 90,Les Paul is such a complete entertainer. Just wonderful, uplifting and highly recommended."
5,Billie and Lester compendium - together at last!,"Someone has picked through the 10 Columbia Quintessential Billie H. recordings and extracted all the songs where Lester Young's tenors sax slithered around Billie's lines. And these were always my favorites anyway. Billie called Lester ""Prez"" - President of Saxophone - because she loved his playing.This is a different Billie than the Billie on the 50's Verve recordings. Even when she sings a sad ballad, she seems sassy, chipper and somewhat upbeat. A twinkle in the eye. These are classic performances.The recording, well, what can you expect from the 30's? Probably mastered on shellac 78 records, not tape. Adds to the charm. This is about as good a transfer as you can get from this source.Good price.Of the two in this series, this has the best songs....."
2,This isn't chucky!,This is NOT the 1988 Child's Play. It is a film called Child's Play from 1972 and it is not about a demonic doll. Stop talking about Chucky.
5,Sly summer grooves,"The debut album from Elwood, whose real name is apparently Prince Elwood Strickland III, is a fun and winning combination of studio tricks and charismatic songs. Although he may be compared sonically to Sugar Ray, Everlast, or Beck, Elwood carves out his own sound. Clearly more talented than the first two and not as concerned with being hep as Beck is, Elwood makes ""Parlance"" an album full of easy loping summertime grooves.From the opening cut, a funky remake of Gordon Lightfoot's sort-of classic ""Sundown"" to the noisy clatter of ""Stockboy,"" the last song on the disc and the edgiest selection here, Elwood covers a wide range of stylistic bases and does it all well. Check out the catchy chorus and horns on ""Red Wagon,"" or the sophomoric, hilarious ""Bush."" There's something here for everyone, and it should be sold with a six of cold beer to make it perfect for summer."
4,Beck-schmeck,"I read a lot about how this sounds like Beck and Everlast, and I guess there's some truth in it in so far as it's hip-hop influenced. That's as far as it goes though. It's like comparing The Beatles to Pantera because they both play guitar music, and is inherently lazy and close minded.For my money Elwood is far more melodic and therefor more commercial, and I guess this is why certain pretentious, hipster Beck fans find it so offensive. I'm no fan of the mainstream, but having just listened to the album again after a couple of years, and as the owner of the back catalogues of both Beck and Everlast, I'd say this beats both hands down.Maybe it's not as artsy, and maybe Elwood's vocals aren't the best, but musically it's excellent. A real feel good record. Highly recommended.Why oh why didn't he make another album?"
4,Elwood makes you feel good!,"I bought this CD on a whim after sampling a few tracks at a local music store. I was surprised to find that I liked every track on it. Many will buy this CD for ""Sundown"" but the stand out tracks for me are ""Red Wagon"" and ""Dive"". This is a groovy, jazzy, feel-good album that you'll find yourself listening to again and again. It also has hip-hop elements without the foul language, which is refreshing. Highly recommended!"
4,"Hmmmm, beck??","I got this cd because I actually had been hearing an awful lot of elwood, and liking it. Sundown, Red Wagon, and Forty Five are probably the best songs on this cd... but I heard Bush a little while back, don't ask me how. Anyways, I'm thinking Elwood sounds a little more like Everlast then Beck, but not enough to say that Elwood is copying or remaking anything. Give them a break... I mean even if they are following up everlast or beck, who says they are not doing a better job?"
2,over hyped,"There was considerable hype preceeding the publication of this book. The attention was fueled by Richardson's political career as a fixer, shaker and head kicker. There was prmise that the book would 'reveal all'. However, the hype was just that hype. Richardson joins the dots on his career, and mentions all the right names and his contact withthem. There certainly wasn't anything controversial in the book. Oh, Richardson does admit that politicians do occasionally lie. I think that was obvious."
1,Affected and tiring,"Drew, a college student, is taken in by his wealthy friend,Bahar, who introduces him to her brother, Jake, and encourages anaffair between the two. Despite his attraction for Jake, Drew becomes disturbed as he learns that Jake and his sister may have been party to the death of another girl when they were in high school. The more he investigates, the more Jake seems to want him to know about the brutal rape and stabbing. This novel bored me. The dialogue tried too hard to be hip, and while it might appeal to twentysomethings, I found it affected and tiring, soon to be dated. In addition, most of the novel occurs in dialogue, and the combination of that and the almost non-stop references to songs leads me to suspect this is a novel bent on trying to be sold someday as a screenplay. I can only hope it makes a better movie than a book, and that the characters are given more depth and their actions fuller explanation."
1,Ugh.,"I couldn't get past the first few chapters. Two guys screwing in a car in the parking lot of a rock concert? Unless the headliner was George Michael, these two would have been killed. Get real. But I decided to give the book a fair shot and continued reading. Bad idea. The dialogue in the car between the main character and the sister was so laughable (and endless) I had to put it down. It made me cringe really hard. Does ANYONE talk like that? I think not. It's always sad when an older writer tries too hard to sound young and hip. Dialogue that is this lame couldn't even pass for a bad sitcom. Truly insulting stuff. It's a shame because the premise (and the cover) was intriguing. Don't waste a single moment of your precious time on this inane crud."
3,Up and Down,"In a word: intriguing. This novel captures the reader from the beginning and slowly lets you down. I feel as though he gave up on writing at the end. And the ending--WHAT?? All together though, it was sexy, fun, and a little eery."
3,Writing 10; Story 5,"Neihart has spun an interesting tale where the telling takes precedence over the story. Initially, the somewhat loathsome characters are mildly intriguing. Soon we are bored with them just in time for the story to blow up into a mystery of sorts. Unfortunately, it unfolds in a long, confusing sequence that ultimately does not pay off. The book seemed more like a personal experiment in writing. Recommended for writing students only."
1,Poorly researched,"I don't know where to start. Incorrect dates. Incorrect, exaggerated or just plain ridiculous accounts.After reading it, I began to wonder if it was researched on the internet.The mercenaries who fought in Angola in 1976 are almost nonexistent in this book, even though most of what the public knows about soldiers of fortune is a direct result of this debacle.The accounts of Bob Denards actions in the Comoro Islands is extremely inaccurate, as if the author lifted it verbatum from some pulp magazine.When the author discusses ""Mad Mike"" Hoare, he begins by lauding him highly, but in the end depicts him as a pitiable has-been. And his account of the Seychelles operation is ridiculous in its recounting.I could go on and on, but the more I write this review, the angrier I become.Save your money."
3,"Good, but not Amazing.","This is a very informative book, but that's all it is. It has good detail about mercenaries throughout history, but that's it. The author has just written nothing but facts. Like my title says, it's good, but not amazing."
4,Not bad...,"As a big fan of Tribe, I had to check this album out on General Principle. Phife Dawg raps about the industry and its changed status, which is refreshing to hear amidst the ice, the cars, the women, and the money everyone seems to throw in their lyrics these days. Great solo effort (track #5 is phat)."
2,Phife Dawg is lackin',Phife and Tip kept it real with the tribe. Tip came back with a great solo cd. I was really looking forward to this cd but when it came out I was dissapointed. The tracks are lacking and it just didn't live up to Phife name. It was a waste of money
2,"Phife Heart Just Breaks My heart, on this Cd","Being a huge fan of TCQ, and always feeling that Phife Diggy was always infairly judged second behind Q, this album just breaks my heart. When I first popped it in my ears started to bleed when I first heard ""Flawless"". To my horror Phife was spittin more curses then in all other TCQ albums combined. I don't mind them, but obviously this is not Phife's style. Its obvious that Phife completely sold out and doesn't give a damn about hip hop or TCQ anymore. For those dirty south ""Gangsters"" lookin for big beats get this, but for real TCQ fans, stay far, far away"
3,Not as good as it should have been,"If I had written this review 13 years ago, I would have given this album 5 stars. In reality, I think it's a 3.5 star album, but Amazon doesn't allow half-star ratings, so I'm giving it 3 stars. The beats are underwhelming and the lyrics are underwhelming for a hip-hop legend who's known for his dope lyrics. He seemed bitter about how Tribe imploded and took some veiled shots at Q-Tip. I gave it three stars because its an okay album, not not an album that I had to have.Of course the irresponsible, college-kid in me likes the Bend Ova song for all the wrong reasons... lol"
3,some people just don't understand,"some people just don't understand creativity. as far as the lyrics go this cd is gold, yet it lacks in production. some of the beats flat out suck bum. The last person who posted is misguided. going solo isn't always the best move for some people. and amplified by q-tip aside from breath and stop and a couple other misfires was pretty damn good. you got to have the production if you don't it's all over. unlike the last review I hope tribe does get back together one last time, I really think it would be another hip hop classic if they did, some people don't understand the creative process when you get creative people in a studio together they work off and with each other and that's what tribe needs to do, forget the egos , record contracts, and glitz and glamour and set the record straight. but until then hip-hop rap will always be mostly filled with wackness."
2,Phife Causing Stress and Strife for His Hip Hop Life,"I don't know about you, but if a Tribe called Quest really meant what they said in the Source about dibanding the group for fear of their fans thinking that they have become wack, then their decisions to persue solo careers really did not live up to what they said. Instead, the two questers Q-Tip and Phife(we'll leave Ali out of this, props to Lucy Pearl)should have just stated that they felt they deserved some of the spotlight away from the group as a whole. To sum it all up, both attempts are utter failures. Phife's claim of 'Flawlessness' is total shame in this deservedley underrated and poorly produced piece of string."
4,5 Footer,"Phife & Q-Tip parted ways from Tribe, but Phife kept it lyrically real to hip-hop. With such hot producers as Pete Rock, Hi-Tek, and Jay-Dee, the beats stay tight and consistant. If you liked Phife's MCing in the past, nothing's changed. The 5 Footer shows how one could grow mentally in hip-hop for 2K and beyond."
2,weak,"Other than ""flawless"", this album is embarrassing. Phife is one of the best MC's of all time so we expect him to hold a higher standard than this."
4,Just what I expected,"If you've ever had the pleasure of listening to Tribe's many albums, then you will notice a definative split in style:those dominated by Q-Tip, and those by Phife. The album is all Phife Diggy. Less jazzy, more soul, and most importantly, more hip-hop. This whole album is more raw than ATCQ ever was. If tracks like ""Can I Kick It?"" and most of The Low-End Theory are your thing, then so is this."
2,look elsewhere.,"while i am a huge Johnny Winter fan,these songs were uninspired and some sounded dull.i probably will never put this on again."
5,Perfect for 18 months old or older!,Cute short book. My son loved this book from the first time I read it to him around 12 months old. He's now 2 1/2 and still loves it!
4,Bon choix de pièces et bonne exécution,"Ce n'est pas toujours facile de choisir un CD qui contient à la fois un bon choix de pièces et une bonne exécution mais ce CD est plus qu'acceptable; je dirais mme qu'il est au-dessus de la moyenne. Donc, si vous aimez la musique militaire ou la musique thématique de films militaires, c'est un bon choix."
3,Soundtrack stands on its own,"I enjoyed the movie when it came out, but the soundtrack did not make much of an impression. Someone mentioned the soundtrack on a high end stereo website, and after listening, I think the soundtrack stands on its own. It is consistent thematically and in instrumentation, unlike the compilation approach of, say Heat, which has a few outstanding and obscure tracks by a variety of artists. If you are interested in soundtracks or exotic percussion, give this one a listen. Also can recommend the work by Warren Ellis and Nick Cave on ""The Proposition"" and the ""Assassination of Billy the Kid..."""
2,Not convincing,This soundtrack was a little disappointing. I am a huge fan of James Horner's scores generally but this one failed to hit the mark. In listening to this cd I didn't really feel it conveyed the themes of both the movie nor the Mayan culture.
1,Volume 1 is way better.,"I think the material on this DVD is pretty basic and pretty much for begginers.although I like Dan's teaching way and he knows his way with Lightwave he could kept Motions in Background only in one Volume. Volumetrics (Vol 1) is a way more complex and complete topic to cover. On Volume 2 he covers procedural textures which are easier to experiment with and easier to find things out, covering this topic on 75 minutes seems too much, there was too much room available to fit another related topic.This is for begginers only. But I repeat: I don't have anything against the way Dan teaches his thing, he does a good job there...it was just a matter of choosing more interesting/complex examples.it is not possible that even the tips and shortcuts are the same ones he gives on Vol 1. I would understand that if we were talking about different series, but not on the same collection."
2,Must Style Preclude Function?,"No index, no page numbers, no captions to the photos--teasing out the credits for them is hard enough. This book is pretty, using very au courant page and font layout and colors, photos of the latest ""it"" gals and guys (Cameron Diaz, Salma Hayek, Samuel L. Jackson), their clothes and hair(slip dresses, blue eye shadow, twin sets, bouffy hair). This book is going to be out of date in about ten seconds from now. Buy a Vogue magazine instead--at least you'll know who the models are and whose clothes they're wearing."
2,Great photos of stars -- but not useful for ordinary people,"If you like looking at photos of celebrities this book is fine. But if you're looking for useful suggestions for looking pulled together, try another book, ""Big City Style,"" for example, by Vincent Roppatte, has head to toe advice and is aware that we're not all size 4 movie stars."
1,Complete waste of money!!,"What a huge disappointment! As a cavalier owner, I was really looking forward to this DVD. They claim it's 60 min but the segment on Cavaliers is only about 20 min.if that. The rest from what I can tell is a training segment on other dogs. I was so disgusted I stopped watching. The video itself shows just one blenheim cavalier puppy the entire time, even when they're talking about adult cavaliers(using the same shots,a little girl petting the puppy, a guy talking in front of a home holding the puppy,etc. Nothing about what they'll look like when they get older. They use charts to show the growth?? Boy, did I get ripped off!"
4,all about gravity,"I Fall Down is part of the Science Play Series by Vicki Cobb. This book is part science information book and part experiment book. This book is on the topic of Gravity. The experiments use household objects such as balls, keys, blocks, shoes, honey and a few more.The book gave enough information on the topic of gravity to inform the reader with out overwhelming them.We would recommed this book to preschool aged children. This will introducte them to the concept of gravity in a way that they can easily understand."
5,Great for Teaching Gravity!,"There's a reason the authors of ""Picture Perfect Science,"" an excellent science teaching resource, use this book in their lesson on gravity. My kids loved this book after we used it in class- it explains the concepts in such an easy-to-understand way and offers opportunities for the kids to test out those concepts. Another great classroom book made available and affordable by Amazon!"
1,Good/Bad experience,"Product was shipped promptly, but neither watch worked when we opened them Christmas morning. Had to return them, but did receive full credit."
5,A good recording of a great concert,"I saw this very band perform this album in Wellington, New Zealand in the mid 70's and was totally blown away by the concert! Being a musician myself I'd never seen fusion played live before. It changed my life. These guys just had fun the whole concert. I'd wished at the time that my playing skills were one little bit as good as any of these guys and as for the drummer, well he was also the lead singer, a feat in itself. Yes this is an honest documentary of a truly remarkable band!"
3,I agree with earlier review of Hammer trying to outdo Beck,"It is a well done fusion recording that should have been labled the ""Jan Hammer group live"" because, with the exception of 'freeway jam', Jeff Beck is basically a side guitarist.Thus if you are looking for the live equivilant of 'Blow by blow' or ""Wired', look elsewere.Pitty they don't remix this recording and increase the volume of the guitar playing and decrease the volume of the keyboards.If they did, then it would probably be worthy of of trying to sell the recording with the Jeff Beck name attached to it."
5,Strange but good.,I had this a long time ago on cassette. Have wanted to replace for a long time. This is a kinda jazzy/rock mix.
3,"If you listen past the keyboards, not too bad a recording","When virtuosi meet on a live recording, the event can gel or fall apart.On the whole this is a good set, with almost all the players in fine form. Unfortunately the broth is overscented with Jan Hammer attempting to outdo Jeff at every turn, stealing all the solo space and rudely emulating Jeffs' guitar sounds,with the occassional adolescent additions like the ""car horn"" sounds on Freeway Jam.Every Beck fan knows that If Jeff wanted those sounds he would have added his own inimitable version.But if you can listen through the keyboard annoyance,this is a pretty good set, worth owning if you have any interest in Jeff Beck."
3,Another Sony Protected Disk - MP3 denied,This is a great CD that I was happy to find after hearing it growing up.A word of warning however that this is another Sony protected CD that does everything it can to make sure you cannot make even your own personal MP3 copy. Thanks Sony for protecting me from listing to this even on my own personal MP3 player!
4,Serious Beck/Hammer Fan(s) Fare,"I confess this is a sentimantal favorite and not quite what you might expect or demand from the pinnacle that is 70s-era Beck, but still WELL worth the buy. Hammer's ""Darkness/Earth"" is a fantastically done Hammer track (and one of my all-time favorite live tunes)...followed by ""Air Blower/Scatterbrain,"" one of my all-time favorite Beck song(s) which is done surprising justice, and frankly better than I would have expected in a live session (any guitarist who has tried to play Scatterbrain will probably tell you it's not exactly ""Little Brown Jug"").In short, if you like 70s era fusion/rock (and Beck and/or Hammer especially), you should really enjoy this...just don't expect (for the most part) to be knocked out."
3,Worth 10 and only 10.,"This album is worth the ten bucks to pay for it, but only that. As it has been said before, Jan is obviously trying to outdo Jeff here.The impression I get from this album is that Jan is a keyboardist that wants to be a guitarist. Don't get me wrong, Hammer is a great player, but he tries to overshadow Jeff too much. The problem with that is, Jeff has the genius and emotion that Jan is lacking. Jan can pull out the tricks, but he doesn't make a good contrast with Jeff.Freeway Jam is perhaps one of the only songs where you can really hear Jeff rip out in all his majesty. He does it in Blue Wind as well, but Hammer's keyboard tone sounds an awful lot like it. Plus, the singing is absolutely horrible. Worse than BBA's singing. Bleh."
3,"Not Great, But Certainly Not Bad!","Overall, this is not a bad CD and, in fact, at $9.97, it's hard to turn down. Essentially, what you get is 7 songs featuring Jeff Beck on lead guitar backed up by, and sometimes overpowered by, Hammer's organ and the Hammer group.Jeff performs his ""Freeway Jam"", ""She's a Woman"", and ""Scatterbrain"" from his ""Blow by Blow"" CD and ""Blue Wind"" from the CD ""Wired"" (both CD's sell for $7.99 on Amazon). Personally, I prefer the studio quality and performance of these songs, but then again, you don't have Hammer's fusion music on those discs. As with most live performances in the 70's, the quality of the recording is not great and could use some digital remastering to bring it up to todays standards."
4,I saw this show!,"I saw this band, playing this set, in Perth, Western Australia god know's how long ago, I knew I wasn't old enough to drive...Remembering that all this music was done 'live' before click tracks or on stage sequencers, this was amazing.Some of the most amazing synth solos and comping from Jan Hammer, one of the true stylists, at his most dexterous...And Jeff Beck (with whom I wasn't really familiar at the time, though I knew he was a heavyweight...) is the perfect partner. This band had an unusual and angular sound that I haven't heard anywhere else.This cd captures a unique moment in time with some amazing players at the peak of their abilities.Great and exciting stuff."
1,Boring and bland,"This game might be good for a computer user who doesn't have a very powerful computer or who might be colorblind, but if this isn't the case I cannot reccomend this game. In the end playing it was like pulling teeth.Firstly, everything is gray. Gray people, gray backgrounds, gray personalities. You are sent to investigate a science facility and slowly learn about a plot that is causing workers to go insane.The graphics are unimpressive and there is very little animation and no voices to speak of. I'm sure that the game could have easily had more done to it or could have been spruced up a tad for its CD release, but such isn't the case.Even when you've reached the meat of the plot things are boring. It become almost impossible to know what items are important because everything, even the people, blend into the gray background. It would have been nice to at least hear a few ambient sound effects or voices, but instead playing Zero Critical is almost like gaming in a silent movie."
2,a VERY basic introduction,I found this book to be an extremely basic introduction to the field of Physical Therapy. It might be helpful to a student in High School (or perhaps even Junior High) But for an undergraduate or grad student it was of little or no help.
2,A One Sitting Read,"A quick and easy intro to the field of physical therapy. I recommend going to your local bookstore and reading it over a cup of coffee. I finished the book in an hour or so by thoroughly reading certain parts and skimming others. Not a bad book, just not worth buying."
3,"""Whassup? Nothing, watching the game, listing to tunes..""","Well, I personally loved the ""Whassup"" series of ads for Bud, and this CD is just catchy enough to make you buy it. I remember when MC Hammer was still big (I know, I'm ancient) and the use of the MC Hammer ""Can't Touch This"" rhythm with the ""Whassup"" samples is pretty good. The timings are clean, so you don't get that 13 year old, computer geek in the basement sound, and the overall feel of all three tracks is pretty good. I bought this CD in a store for approx US$2.50, but I would be hard pressed to part with US$10.00 for it."
2,A very disappointed fan!,As a huge Agassi fan I am very disappointed with this item. The first two disks are a total waste. Only the last one with the 92 Wimbledon final is worth watching. Why is Andre not in these interviews? WTF? It seems that the purpose of the first disk is to praise Mike Agassi and not Andre. It should be titled the Mike Agassi story.
1,Misleading,"Product is aptly named ""The Agassi Story"" on the box/cover b/c it IS about ""Agassi""--Mike Agassi, his dad. Waste of money to purchase this if you want to see any background on Andre Agassi. There was little to nothing on Andre. The product's only saving grace is the complete coverage of the 92 Wimbledon Final. If you're looking for anything about Andre Agassi on DVD, don't buy this, unless like me, you were able to get it for just 2.99 b/c that's what it's worth... Actually, less than that..."
5,Fully Revised and Full of Action!,"I purchased Martell's blue books a couple of years ago but never could find this one. The used book price got up over $100 and was glad to see it was being updated. The update is complete -- current films referenced throughout -- and a ton of information for creating the next $1 mill action spec script! At least we can hope... Entertaining and informative, a big two thumbs up for this one!"
5,Every Writer Should Own a Copy,"Like many other reviews have said, don't let the title fool you. ""The Secrets of Action Screenwriting"" covers car chases, shoot-outs, and exploding bombs, but it also explores the protagonist's internal struggle, theme & voice, and everything else needed for a satisfying story. William Martell offers examples from classic films and his own work to show how to hook the reader and keep them turning the pages.Without a doubt one of the most helpful books ever written on the art of screenwriting."
4,Very good book but buy reprint,"This is a very good book and I learned a few things, but for the most part I think that if you're a writer a lot of it should be natural or common sense. He's coming up with a reprint so I'd buy that as a valuable addition to your library, but to pay 110 dollars as I did was a horrible waste of money."
3,Black and Decker 2Amp Charger,"If you need a cheap 2 amp charger and dont care about features or performance, then you might consider this charger. Overall, I did not like this charger. It does provide a basic 14.3 V charge, which is good for gel batteries, just not good with Flooded or AGM batteries."
1,All 4 failed within one year!,"I bought my first two last year for two of the cars I dont use often. Within a a couple of months both of them have failed... so I thought maybe I got a bad shipment. So I stupidly purchased two more to replace them... Both replacements failed within 6 months... worse yet, one of them still had a green light on like it was working!! I didn't know it was feigning proper operation until I tried to start the car... with a completely dead battery!DO NOT trust the other 5 stars here! All of them are short and claim they liked the product for having STANDARD features!! Hire better writers for your sham reviews, Black and Decker!This is the absolute worst product I have ever purchased!!"
3,Worked well while it lasted ** updated,"This charger (Black&Decker; BM2B) was used to maintain a boat battery and it worked well for that purpose. After just over a year of use, however, the charger failed. It would repeatedly click on for a fraction of a second and then click off. Tried it on another battery in another location and it did the same thing. It's still under the 2 year warranty so I plan to ask for a replacement. Will update my review based on B&D;'s response.6/2/10 Got this charger replaced under warranty (I still had a receipt) for only the cost of shipping it to the warranty center. If I get another year out of the replacement, I'll be happy overall."
2,Stay away!,"Despite the warnings from other reviewers, I purchased this item anyways. It worked flawlessly for about a month, and then started acting weird the 2nd month and failed completely on the 3rd. Get something more reliable instead!"
2,Not worth the money,"I purchased several of these trickle chargers and was dissapointed in their function, I purchased some cheaper models that did function well through the winter. Do NOT use these on ATV batteries they have a habit of boiling the small battery dry and ruining it requiring me to buy a new battery the exact thing that I was trying to avoid. I checked with the ATV dealer and they had experienced similar problems with trickle chargers left on for an extended period of time."
3,como se dice,"was dissappointed with package, assumed also included workbook for price, daughter could have bought both books for same at school. also didn't have all cd's in package."
5,Bobby,"With da ""help"" or da touch of bobby womack, gabor give us such agood moment of guitar jazz, it s so clear and crystal, u ll likethe purety of this album..."
3,Let's See,"I was having fun with the injector items at first, but then I had a problem on my hands. I couldn't get any of the kits! There is a place near the incubator room (that's where you hatch your eggs) where there is a token about as big as the average norn spinning around with the symbol of the science on it. What do I do with that? I never did find out. Now I'll give you tips on things I found frustrating. First, to get an egg you have to go to the hatchery and double click on the egg you want. The egg will pop up in the incubator room. Then you can hatch it with the incubator. One day I started up the game and my norns (and every other creature) was stuck head first into the ground. I don't know what happend! I hope it doesn't happen to you!"
3,This game could do alot better!,"When I first got this game I was so excited because it was used and I had been waiting for weeks. But when I got on the game it took me a while to even hatch an egg! The help would not work only tips! They say this game is for six and up well there is a fertility section that explains ""sex vibes"" and that is not appropriate for six and under plus the norns are impossible to feed so they die!!!Please reconsisder before buying this game!"
5,Very Addictive,"I've had the game for about one and a a half years now and it's still as fun to play now as it was then. What makes it so fun is that you can always get new creatures breeds off from the internet, you can also get new types of plants, animals, food, and other things that will help your creatures world from the internet. By breeding different types of norns you can get some really neat colorful looking norns. I highly reccommend getting this game."
1,Poor Fit,This was way too large for my 5 month old (16 lbs). We were only able to fit him in it long enough to take a picture. Even then it looked bad. It loses shape very quickly. It's not something you want to leave your baby in for long. The fabric is thin around the neck and seems like a choking hazard.
4,Sesame Street - Dance and Move Box Set,"We like all the dvd's except the ""Dance Along"" one. That one is a little dated. My 2 year old son loves the other two, Elmocize and Dance Moves and these are all he wants to watch! They are alot of fun!"
4,If your child loves to dance...,"Dance Along is great for a child that loves music and is dancing around the house. Our 18-month-old is riveted when the Sesame Street children start dancing. He likes to watch their feet and copy their moves, so these interactive videos are perfect. I read another review that said the ""Zoey's Dance Moves"" was too advanced, but my son is fascinated by it all. Zoey and Paula Abdul put together a dance that includes ballet, hip hop and Asian moves. It includes clips of children from various cultures dancing, which is informative, and professional dancers whose moves are inspiring. I'm not crazy about Elmocize, because it strikes me as being a bit contrived, but my son does watch it. If I had the choice, I'd skip it and just buy the first two."
2,"My son loves elmocize, but I'd rather he didn't.","I got these for my son for Christmas. Where we live it is impossible for him to go outside to play for much of the year due to the ugly weather. I thought maybe he could get some of his wiggles out with these videos.I was pretty disappointed with these videos. They are seriously outdated and kind of obnoxious. And worst of all, my son just wants to sit on the couch and watch them. He is not at all motivated to join in any of the action on the movies. I thought there would be more straight forward, step by step instruction for dance/exercise moves that my son could follow along with."
5,Best Mortise bit,"This spiral router bit is best used for mortising or deep dado cuts because it will better eject debris from the cut. They are much better to use for these tasks than standard straight flute bits which do not efficiently eject debris and result in slower cutting and more heat buildup on the router bit, which will dull its edges faster and reduce bit life. This bit offers the same high quality milling and finish as with most Freud router bits. Worth spending the extra for this one."
1,Tainted research,Connell is usally an excellent writer but her reportingon Medjugorje is compromised and shallow.
2,I Needed That Nap!,"Do Or Die is not one of Andy Sidaris' best movies. It's actually pretty boring, except for when things are blowing up or when one of the beautiful broads is popping her top. What really chafed my butt is that there is no Pat Morita nude scenes. I wanted to see his 2 inch twig and berries!"
2,Campy Playmate long feature film,"Another fun, campy Sidaris film. Great Playboy playmates in a beautiful Hawaiian setting, Vegas, Texas long feature. The esoteric playboy love sessions are really in keeping with the genre. Sidaris uses many of these actors in other of his films with similar story lines...sex, espionage, electronic toys...fun!"
2,Campy Playmate long feature film,"Campy,fun Playmate long feature film with a great variety of settings - Hawaii, Vegas, Texas...AND a great variety of Playboy playmates. Sidaris tastefully and aesthetically has the most incredible love making scenes. Plots are fun, sex, espionage, electronic toys and B movie dialogue. These same actors are often used in other Sidaris movies...did I mention the playmates!"
3,"I Liked it, But I Have My Dislikes","I liked this series, and I loved how the wrtier introduced God and relying on him to heal wounds of the past. But I have to say I found myself angry at how the Johnson family seems so weak, particulary in this book. They just seemed to let Brenda Wilkins' family accuse Libby, and were about to kick Libby out of there home without a fight. How could they just give in like that?And another thing I dislike is how they don't protect Libby and their children from harmful kids like Brenda. If I were a parent, I wouldn't just let some hateful brat abuse my child, I'd back them off. And they just let Brenda bully her.I think Christians should protect themsevles and their children and not get confused about being loving and letting evil trample all over them."
5,Eltzabeth Gail Is Great !,"I think every girl should read at least one book, because they are great life lessons. She teaches us so many different things and it is really fun to read them too. From LEAH."
2,Slow and almost unimaginative.,"A collection of sci-fi stories. All of which are dated , writen in an old style without any action OR science. It's all about satelite problems and stuff like that in the 21th century.I'm not saying that it was'nt good when it was relevent as sci-fi , but those stories are just not the kind that lasts forever. And anyway Clarke's writing was always WAY too slow for me. He's just not part of the real mindblowers generation of sci-fi - A pioneer , but not an immortall giant , in my opinion.For a better read of the old fellows , read A.E.Van-Vogt , Heinlin , or E.E.Smith (Lensmen series)."
5,A MUST HAVE FOR ENY ICP FAN,"This CD is the shxt!This CD may cost a little bit more but it's well worth the money!An less you're a cheap AXX or just to daxn poor.The best songs on it are Hey Vato,Willy Bubba,Hokus Pokus Remix,Piggy Pie old school,and Santas A Fat Bxtch.If you aint got Forgetten Freshness you aint really down the clown mxthafxcka."
3,ICP at their darkest,"This CD has all kinds of cool Halloween stuff they only gave out to fans in clown makeup at their shows. Much, much better in my humble opinion (I don't generally like rap) than ""Milenko"" or their new album. This album is absolutely evil, and very fun to listen to because all the tracks were recorded separately and sound very different. ICP finally got to release their material the way it was originally intended. Don't be scared off by ICP's admonition ""some of this stuff sucks..."" I just don't agree, in fact I think that if half of these tunes had been on their last three albums, they'd be more universally respected by now. As for the racist remarks from one of the reviewers that preceded me, I hope someday someone will lighten up and enjoy things for what they are. P.S. James Brown rules."
5,It is Really FRESH!!!,"Yo, Anything that the Insane Clown Posse does is rated 5 stars!! They are the best group!! I can't rate the songs because they are all good!! MTV doesn't know what they are missing!! icp made ""MTV friendly"" songs but they don't play them! CHAd"
5,ICPs BEST!!!,"Insane Clown Posse was and isnt real famous,but I first got ICPs CD RIDDLE BOX in 2000,and I instantly liked them,but this is thier best CD,I also own RINGMASTER,RIDDLE BOX,BIZZAR,and THE GREAT MILENKO.If you want ICPs best effort albums {in this order}get this one,than THE AMAZING JEKEL BROTHERS,RIDDLE BOX,GREAT MILENKO,CARNIVAL OF CARNAGE,BIZZAR,BIZAAR,and than FORGOTTEN FRESHNESS VOL3. ps I have only heard 1 trak off of THE WRAITH OF SHANGRALI."
1,Wack Wigger attempt. Buy records made by Black Artists.,"There are far too many young people listening to this music who have not already heard the prerequisite James Brown's Funky People vol 1, 2. Public Enemy. Souls of Mischief. Pharcyde. DeLaSoul. Tribe Called Quest. Eric B and Rakim. DJ Red Alert. Wu-Tang Clan. Search Amazon for one of these other artists and buy a record from black rap artists and not white boys (apologies to Beastie Boys and 3rd Bass). Then there are Funk essentials also: Isaac Hayes. Curtis Mayfield. Barry White. mid 70s Marvin Gaye Temptations. Bootsy Collins. George Clinton. Funkadelic. Ohio Players. and more. Please do not buy any ICP records until you know the roots of the medium that they are trying to ""Pat Boone."""
2,A very log wait,it took a whole month before it finally came so i would give it 2 star rating but i will not used this company again
4,better than the new CD...,"i have had this CD for about a year, give or take...and i still listen to it everyonce inawhile. i like it a lot better than the new CD, the amazing jeckyl brothers. if you didn't like the CD, that is your choice, but you have to understand this was stuff that wasn't released...which in my opinion, i thought should have. but anyway, if you are a true ICP fan, this is a MUST have...a great 2 CD set. Loved it."
5,Coins of the World,"This is a great book, beautifully illustrated. Bought it for my niece who has just started collecting foreign coins. It is easy to use, fully illustrated, and gives great background on foreign countries and their history as well as information regarding the coins themselves. Would highly recommend this book."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I was purchasing this book as an addition to my daughters coin collection with hopes it has all coins from this country, not so the book is primarily coins from other countrys we didn't like it at all."
2,Sorry but it is incomplete,The book did not meet my expectation of coin collecting. A book like that would have a mention of every coin made. It is incomplete and not a good reference.
3,Interesting experimental format,"When it was at the peak of it's popularity, Mad Magazine was everywhere an adolescent boy looked, and this set of paperback books was an interesting attempt to carry the appeal of the magazine into a paperback book format.The book is not much different from the comic drawings that were so prominently featured in the magazine. In this particular book, Don Martin has some extended sketches that parody ""The Fly,"" ""King Kong,"" and a field guide for cockroaches. However, his best work is probably the shorter bits, if only because they pack in more jokes per minute, and the jokes aren't terribly funny.Many of the comics derive their humor from a twist ending, such as the spider who builds his web only to have the last frame reveal that his support sticks are actually the fingers of a giant fly.If you're a Madaholic, you should pick this collection up for nostalgia's sake; otherwise, there's no real reason to own this book."
4,Gonna Fly Now,"20 years ago I would have given this 5 stars. 10 years ago 4 stars. 2 years ago 5 stars. Today 4 stars. Basically, it's only drawback is its ""dated"" sound. It is Very late seventies. When I'm in that seventies mood, it's great. If I'm not, it's a little flat. The musicianship is excellent. And even though it contains the slightly cheesy themes from Rocky and Star Trek, the album actually works on many levels. There is a lot going on. The rhythm section is ridiculously tight and funky. The title track is a fine counterpoint to the pop element. ""The Fly"" is funky fun. Maynard gets the same bad rap that Harry James got back in the day (technical flare over substance), but I just put that down to ""high note"" envy."
3,Great Musicians Make Mediocre Material Shine,"Proving once again that great musicianship can make so-so material okay, Maynard and his sidemen do the job. Keep in mind that on this record, you are really hearing only part of the regular band...lots of studio guys were hoisted onto Maynard by Bob James, head of Columbia's jazz section back then. Jay Chattaway, a very popular arranger in the 70's and 80's, does some good things to meet the commercial demands of the time. The Rocky tune became the first big band top 40 single since Glenn Miller in the 40's, and made this album the best selling album by a jazz great. MF took a lot of heat over some of his commercial approaches during this time period, but the playing is solid and hey, we all got over it. Buy this."
3,A very listenable album...but not representative of MF,"If you are an MF novice, this is a great album to start with. Rocky is the popular tune that sent MF mainstream, but beyond that this album is not one of the deepest for Maynard. The band is good...Peter Erskine on drums and Bobby Militello on sax of particular note. But the charts are not the greatest. I can still remember the reactions of my MF-fan friends when we saw this concert tour after having seen Chameleon's tour. It was a while before I spent $$$ going to see MF again. Let's just say I made sure to buy the albums before going to the concert. Fortunately, they got better."
1,Terrible!,"I received the product in pieces, the mirrior reflectors where detached from the telescope. The over quality of the telescope was poor (even if it wasn't defective upon arrival) I don't recommend this particular item, spend a little more money and get a higher quality telescope."
3,Wireless Keyboard & Mouse,"Site description listed product mfg. as being IBM. On receipt, I found it was mfg. by Levono and was a German language keyboard - review of the seller's site description did so describe it but it was not in the Amazon site description. I returned the product and reordered an English language version. I was credited for purchase price but not the shipping costs.Installation required Internet access to download the drivers though a CD is shipped with the product. No instruction was provided during the setup process regarding the initialization of the receiver with the keyboard and mouse. This was surmized from a decal on the bottom of the keyboard.As this was a gift to a friend, I have no opinion regarding its performance or reliabity."
5,CELESTIAL MELODIES!!!!!,"THIS IS THE KIND OF MUSIC I EXPECT TO LISTEN TO, WHEN I GO TO HEAVEN!!!!....WELL,.......IF I END UP GOING THERE!!!I DON'T KNOW OF A TUNE MORE HARMONIOUS, ETHEREAL AND DIVINE THAN ""KITA KAIRA""......OF ALL THE EARTHLY MUSIC THAT I'VE LISTENED TO, THIS IS THE CLOSEST THING TO HEAVENLY MUSIC!!!!""YAMFA"" IS ANOTHER OUTSTANDING MELODY FROM THIS GEM!!!FROM THE ""KAIRA"" ALBUM...""ALLA LA KE"", ""KONKOBA"" AND ""KAIRA"", COMPLEMENT THESE MASTERPIECES OF HARMONY!!!I JUST HAVE TO THANK GOD FOR ALLOWING ME TO LISTEN TO THIS HEAVENLY MUSIC,.....RIGHT HERE..........ON EARTH!!!TOUMANI AND BALLAKE THE TALENTED ANGELS ON KORAS!!!"
2,First recording was very good!,I listened to the first 4 recordings but found the first one to be the very best. The sound was excellent and the rhythm was upbeat and together. I found in the other 3 that they were not coming together. The first instrumental would be great if you had a store and wanted to play this a few times during the day.
5,New and Ancient Strings,This is the second CD by Toumani Diabate et al that I have heard. Words cannot ultimately express the calming beautyof the flowing music. When I am feeling anxious or discontented I play him. The music enters your soul by a side door and seeps like a gently trickling mountain stream into the deepest areas of your mind. Whatever you happen to be doing becomes a labour of love and a fount of grace.
4,Untitled,"Toumani Diabate is regarded as the master of the Kora(a sort of harp built around a gourd which produces a singularly sweet,sharp and quite remarkable tone).He is joined here by a second kora player to produce a modern take on what is viewed as the classical music of Mali.This music takes time to grow on you ,or maybe you just need to take the time to listen.But it has the power to remove you from your place and time and take you somewhere else.This is music as uncomplicated as the wind."
5,"Relaxing, Amazing, Must Buy CD!","If you love the Koto, buy this CD. If you don't love the koto, buy this CD. It is amazing and you will enjoy every second of it. No exaggerations!"
5,Pure beauty,"Another reviewer said that this music 'grows on you""- but on me it didn't have to. I think this is the most purely beautiful music I've ever heard (that, and certain pages of Bach and Mozart).Even though - or because - it's desert music, it conjures up fast-flowing water at night: it's mellow, quiet, deeply relaxing, yet full of energy. I can listen to it before going to bed or while at work. I've never tried to play it when other people are around though, it strikes me as 'private moment' music. Think I might play it at my next dinner party to see whether the conversation stops!I've been listening to West African music for years now, and love it all. But if you have to own only one CD of music from the Sahel, make it this one."
5,Full Catastrophe Living,Very excellent. The book has very good ideas and methods to reduce stress in today's Life.
3,Full Catastrophe Living Audio - Help!,"It doesn't have a table of contents so you don't know what each CD covers! Too frustrating for words! His info is good and examples are helpful, but am still frustrated!"
2,old hat,"Of course all books are made up of words, but the wordiness of this book made it possible for me to read the whole thing in one hour and see that it did not contain anything new."
2,Long-winded and simplistic,Waste of my time and money. Five pages of mediocre material stretched painfully over to hundreds of pages of specious and arrogant malarkey. What a crock.
5,Full Catastrophe Living/Summary,Jon Kabot-Zinn has such a profound understanding of the human spirit that I may open anywhere within the book and become totally absorbed. This book in particular is a gift to mankind.
4,Meditation does not have to mean sitting still,"Being mindful is a well-known technique for lowering stress. Jon Kabat Zinn has the experience to show us how this is done. I really liked this book and his descriptions.However, as a person with ADD, the idea of trying to sit still for 45 minutes and quieting my mind seemed impossible. But after his explanations of walking meditation and using yoga as meditation I could see myself meditating.This book is a classic and rightly so. Well worth your time (for reading and trying the techniques) and money (for the book, and if you use yoga for the accessories)."
3,"Getting long in the tooth, needs better editing, updating","This could be an amazing book if it were 1/2 to 3/4 of its current size, though the protocol itself seems to produce results. I would recommend the ""Buddha's Brain"" for those interested in the intersection of western science and mindfulness."
4,Full Catastrophe Living,I have purchased the book and the audio. Both are very helpful in my recovery process. I urge all who has gone through something traumatic to get the book as well audio. I would like to thank my Psycologist for referring this book to me.
5,Mindfullness,This book is very helpful to both me and my son who is recovering from cancer surgery. It gives us an alternative way to help deal with this crisis in our lives.
4,Full Catastrophe Living,"I totally love this book. It has changed my life. My anxiety level was really high and my doctor recommended this book to help me and it WORKED. I am learning so much about myself. This is the only book that you need if you suffer from anxiety, or depression....but you have to really do the stuff it tells you to do, but keep at it and it works! I relax and meditate and love it!!"
3,Full Catastrophe Living,Hate the title. This is the kind of reference that you can listen to because it would be easy to put down if you were reading it. Love the layout and the author is genuine.
5,Shows practical applicability,"The references to MBSR, while acquired in a medical context, remain recognisable to the layman. The language and the message are crystal clear.The book contains a lot of practical advice regarding the ""right"" mindset (""You don't have to like it, ...""). After - while - reading it, one just wants to practice. Mission accomplished, J-K!"
5,Recommended by Health News Network,"Full Catastrophe Living has been recommended as a timely and well-written guide deserving our highest rating. We only select winning books based on sound and healthy advice. This one not only meets those criteria, it offers readers valuable information and guidance they will find both useful and easy to follow. A Health News Network ""best buy."""
3,Need to dig for the pearls.....,"The book if filled with thoughtful insight into how to live in peace. Yet, much of this insight is buried in 625 or so pages of distracting verbiage-it's not distilled. A reader with limited time and attention (me and, maybe, you) gets his train of thought derailed in Mr. Kabat-Zinn's personal life and the details of how he founded his stress reduction clinic at U of Mass. This static interferes with effective assimilation of his important points."
4,Still studying,"This book was recommended by a professional.It's not a breeze-through, done!I'll be reading it for years to come."
2,Orientalism,"Kristeva's early masterpiece that helped to solidify her reputation in the early 70s as a masterly leftist feminist can now be reread as indicative of the Orientalism of the Paris of the 1970s in which Roland Barthes, Jacques Lacan, Philippe Sollers, and many others championed Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution. This revolution of the Parisian letters of the 1970s has now become a powerful wing of what is euphemistically called Cultural Studies, but which is actually a branch of Mao's Cultural Revolution, being played out today in almost every institution of higher education in America.This book is the purest Orientalism of the kind that Edward Said complains about. She actually argues that because the future is so bright after the Cultural Revolution that the possibilities are unlimited.It shows the left's prophetic powers in retrospect."
5,Great single from an up-and-coming artist!,"This is a really great song (you've probably heard it on one of those college stations if at all). The re-mixes are very good, especially the radio-edit, and it changes the whole aspect of the song so it seems like you're getting 5 different ones. I recommend adding it to your collection if you enjoy eclectic, techno-ish music-- think Moby with sitars and chanting thrown in. Highly recommended."
4,Powerful stuff!,"No, this is not that Van Damme garbage, but brutal, action-packed, 1970s Japanese martial arts at its best. Sonny Chiba never had the charisma or fighting skills of Bruce Lee, but then he never pretended he did. He delivered something totally different - gritty, dirty violence; no posturing; bucketfulls of blood. As usual with Eastern movies, particularly of this time period, there's little by way of plot, so what gives this an edge is that Chiba's character is VERY unlikeable. So why root for him? Because he dispatches even more unlikeable characters in some very gruesome ways. He's your typical anti-hero.So, if you like low plot, high violence movies (and you're curious why Tarantino was so desperate to get Chiba in Kill Bill), take a look at this flick - it really is cool!"
1,Fictional Book,"This book was written to entertain and make a profit. The authors, Macy and Buxton, create incredibly believable storylines throught the seventeen chapter book. However, not all accounts are documented in history. Many characters are fabricated, and as romantic as the stories are, they are a product of pure fantasy. A little digging and research will prove all the stories to be fiction."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"They work ok but not as good as other mosquito traps (i.e. Mosquito Magnet) and if it breaks, and it will, you can't get replacement parts because they have no customer service. If you get a hold of them, they're rude and not helpful at all and once you've bought their product they could careless about you. As far as function goes, it doesn't really do that well on it's own. It'll catch a few mosquitos here and there. The problem is the octenol cartridge this uses doesn't seem to work. I bought an octenol cartridge for a machine from another manufacturer and modified it to work with this one and it works better. Definately not worth the hassle or the money. Look for another machine that uses propane and octenol. They're out there for less than this one and you'll be much happier."
2,a huge dissapointment,"To the people that owns Chill in India I and Chill in Arabia, this one will be a huge dissapointment because it repeats 5 songs. The rest are great, just as the first two CD's, but it does not flow like the others, I regret buying it."
4,Catz 3 is very fun!,"I like my catz to have babies.They're so cute when they're first born.It has many kinds of clothes and hats.It also has a pair of glasses and sun- glasses.It has 4 different playscenes,KITCHEN, FAMILYROOM,BACKYARD,& BEACH.It also has the regular PLAYPEN.It has many accessories.I liked it very much."
5,Catz 3,"This is an excellent game, very simple,and easy to use, yet very entertaining. I own this game and can spend hours on it. It is pretty much suitable for all all ages and my whole family enjoys it. If you prefer dogs to catz, however, there is a dogz 3 game which is just a good. I reccomend this program over catz 1, or 2, though, because of the small perks, such as different play areas, and being able to dress the catz etc. All in all i would definetly reccomend this item."
2,I love this game but it doesnt work for XP!,I love this game so much but when i got a windows XP the computer wont work with it so if you have and XP dont get this game otherwize this game rocks!
5,Gorgeous! Some of Hall's best work.....,"With the possible exception of his work with Sonny Rollins and Bill Evans, this is the best work you will find of Jim Hall on cd. It sounds better than ever remastered - you really feel like you are in a jazz club witnessing an intimate collaboration. How can you not like the gentle sophisticated tone Jim Hall gets from his d'aquisto archtop? There are several witty passages quoting different tunes as well as some excellent chordal work. The bassist has a few stellar moments and the drummer is also quite good. A nice gentle yet probing approach to standards."
3,"OK for a salesman, but overpriced.","The book is fine for a salesperson, but why it cost so much? As a pshysisist the book gives me a good reference on how to approach explaning some technologies to non PhD people. By all means not technical - childs play."
4,A good overview of the WDM underlying principles,"I found the text book very usefull as an overview of the technology. Good and at the point description of the components/hardware used for optical communication. The author has an excellent understanding of the physics governing the technology. Some typos can be found through the text, the author should have the text reviewed more carefully. I recommend the book to anyone who wants to know ""how things work""."
3,"Adequate introduction, but there are better...","The book has good coverage, and will leave the reader with a decent overview of what's out there, but very little understanding of anything. While that seems like the point of such a book, it doesn't really make the book useful. This isn't popular physics--anybody who needs an overview of DWDM probably needs a little more than this tiny book can offer.The other reviews about the book's low editing quality were right on. It has the feel of something produced with a laptop, one weekend and an inkjet."
1,Terrible.,"This book is filled with inaccurate physics, typographical errors, poorly drawn illustrations and confusing/misleading explanations. I do not recommend it."
4,"One great song, five excellant ones, six good enough ones","Well, that above is my not always humble opinion, but if you're a Gipsy Kings fan, you'll soon enough have your own favorites.The one which I consider the great one of the group is the ninth cut, ""Quiero Libertad"". This one has a different quality than anything by them I've heard before. Admittedly, I'm not good at understanding the Spanish language, but the whole tone and sound to this song speaks for itself as a strong heart felt statement for freedom.The title cut, ""Somos Gitanos"", gets the album off to a great start, and the second one, a ballad, has a great instrumental break which keeps it going. And of course, ""Mi Fandango"" is representative of the groups best of the upbeat songs. I was quite impressed with the instrumental, ""Felices Dias"", and felt it blended well as a lead in to ""Poquito a Poco"".This album does not present the group at their very best, but it still is outstanding."
5,good product,"this bag makes hauling my yoga mat around much easier. It's good for a 1/4 inch mat, but not anything much thicker."
2,It ain't easy.,"It is very difficult getting my mat out of the bag. If I ever got to yoga class late, I might as well pack it in, because it takes 5 mns. to get the mat out of the bag. I literally have to turn the bag inside out. Getting it in is only fractionally easier."
3,"Good deal, but not best mat bag","This is a perfectly functional mat bag and a good deal for the price. However, while my mat fits inside the bag just fine, I have to struggle with it to get it in and out. In hind sight, I wish I had spent a little bit more for a mat bag that fully zipped open to make it easier to get the mat in and out."
4,good for its price,"I just got this bag. The quality feels ok for its price, but the color is much darker than it looks like online."
4,Good Enough!,"Nothing special, but these bags do the job. The hugger mugger mats easily fit into the bags and make carrying them much easier. I am not sure how long they will last, but they're good enough for now."
3,Not Great Literature But Important Theme Nonetheless,"This novel tells of an important historical fact, one rarely written about. Well into the 20th century, women could be locked up for their entire lives in mental asylums for their sexual orientation or just about any reason their male family members wanted. The stories of these incarcerations are fascinating. However, what those stories have to do with the romance between the main characters is not readily apparent. As a lesbian romance, this book doesn't do well. That part of the book is a little silly. Very much in the ""NO! No. no...yesssss"" vein. Yet, though the book is uneven, it is worth reading for its historical perspective."
5,"Quite, Quite Fantastic!","If you've been thinking of getting one of the A&E DVD re-issues of the original 'Avengers', start with this one. The stand-out episode here is 'Honey For The Prince', which is imaginative, funny, and extremely eccentric (a cricket match breaks out during one scene). There is also the infamous 'Touch of Brimstone' -- notable for its bawdy content and Diana Rigg's 'Queen of Sin' costume. Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg's chemistry as a team was never stronger than in the episodes on this disc (and you get a bonus seventh episode with this set, instead of the standard six)."
2,Avengers '66,"These are some of the best shows I've seen.I'm a big ""Avengers"" fan and have episodes back to the Honor Blackman days. No doubt that Mrs. Peel and Steed were the best duo to tdo the show. I recommend their episodes to anybody."
3,A spiritual Memoir Worth Reading,"I wanted to give this 3 1/2 stars but couldn't figure out how! I read ""Father Joe"" about six months ago and it is one of those books that has stuck with me (so many do not). Tony Hendra's memoir of his difficult spiritual journey left me a little disappointed, but yet it had a big impact. His story moves along well and is quite interesting to read, but the undercurrent of the ebb and flow of nearness to God that is the experience of most Christians was what really carried me along. My disappointment was because Hendra didn't find the answers to all his spiritual questions - but then, neither have I!"
2,This is not the real thing,"This is not the original Swiss Muesli that made this company famous and I've found that in a lot of the stores in this area this is now the only Familia Swiss Meusli available. In my opinion, what they've done is an attempt to make a less costly product ( for them that is} by adding large volume puffed type cereals to the mix. This makes for a lighter product , but with the same size box. The original box weighs 32 ounces, compared to 21 ounces for this new product. Unfortunately, this results in an inferior product, both in taste and nutrition. The real original product is still available in a red box , but I fear they might phase it out if they can get people to go for this cheap imitation."
5,best cereal ever.,I love this cereal. Doesn't get soggy and mushy in milk. Love the fruit and nut bits. The perfect muesli.
2,Disappointed!,This is definitely not the original formula that one can buy in the grocery store. One box might not have been too bad but we had to eat through the complete order of multiple boxes! We were quite disappointed.
2,Apple pieces spoil everything!,"The muesli is good, but dried apple pieces just spoil everything.Would you eat apples with milk?Familia Natural thinks that it's a great idea!"
1,Astounded at bad this was,"My first comment is that I am shocked this is only rated PG. I was sure my kids had made a mistake after we watched it. I can deal with wasting an evening on a so-so movie, but this was bad and worse, parts of it were really offensive. How they can parallel The Exorcist having a baby's head twist around completely, then vomit green stuff and rate it PG is beyond me. I definitely wouldn't let younger children watch this no matter how much they beg. It's disgusting. But what really bothers me is that the movie could have been fairly good had they left out some of this really inappropriate stuff."
1,"very bad, indeed","see what happens when a bad different movie director who makes bad movies(spy kids, cats & dogs)makes a sequel to a very old movie? Everything in this movie sucks, from the 3d animations(believe me, the part where it looks like the baby is dancing looks extremely lame), to the crappy, unpolished storyline. I can't believe the guy who made the movie was courageous enough to put in on dvd and vhs. I'd rather be watching ren & stimpy."
1,That isn't Norse Mythology,"This movie can be renamed Seven Ways to Completely Screw Norse Mythology, although it can be summed up in three steps:- Get the names of norse characters- Find the one that likes to mess things up- Make the rest up yourselfYes, a lot of the badness from my POV is that it butchered a mythology so thoroughly - and there wasn't even a point to it. They could've used the pantheon just as it is and added the mask, without turning Loki into Odin's son and taking away all the fun of his trickery and replacing it with 100 % bad cheese.For a few cheap laughs it might be entertaining, but I'd recommend just watching the original over again."
1,gut(t)erman is the common man's toilet paper,"son of the mask is the worst movie of the last 10-15 years. the movie is not funny and the effects lame. to make it worse, the director larry guterman has solicited friends and associates to write positive reviews in order to try to sell dvds. don't believe this bogus hype. parents protect your children from this disaster and guterman. he lost new line 10's of millions and deservedly so."
1,So awful it feels like a Paul W. S. Anderson/Uwe Boll flick.,"Most of recent films that were so wretchedly bad as to cause physical pain usually bore one of two warnings: ""Directed by Paul W. S. Anderson"" or ""Directed by Uwe Boll"". The excrement named ""Son of the Mask"" has neither of these warning signs, yet it manages to be worse than any of Anderboll's trash bags. If there were liquid badness, this ""film"" would have consisted of it: there is literally nothing even mediocre in it. Even Randy Edelman's score appears to have been written on a used handkerchief in five minutes - but can anyone blame him? I'm amazed that he did not demand that the ""movie"" credited Allan Smithee as the composer..."
4,Creative non-sequel sequel,"I think the biggest pitfall of this movie was that it was called ""The Mask."" No, this is not what you would expect from ""The Mask"" sequel, however, how could you considering this is a movie obviously tailored for tots, not the dark adult audience that the original drew. If you consider it just that, you have something rare: a smart, fun kids movie that has the cartoonish antics for the kids, but the smart jokes and dark theme that appeals to adults. I thought it was very well done and highly recommend it as something that you can give your kids to watch, that they will enjoy through their development and that you will have fun with too."
1,Make Up Your Own Mind.,I haven't seen this film and probably won't.The point is that many of the reviews here for this film quote 'what other sites are saying'.If those people had minds of their own they may be much better citizens.Ironically this movie is about a mask that takes away people's free wills. If they put it on there probably would be no difference.There is a very good chance that this film is garbage but listen to somebody who may have actually seen it.
4,Don't Judge a DVD by it's cover,Ambitious and almost hits the mark of totally brilliant. Don't follow the pack on this one. It's clever and entertaining.
2,Cute and a little funny but nothing special,"I didnt want to see it. Because the trailer made it look so stupid. But I was sort of right but it did make me laugh so its not like i wasted money on it so I dont care. But my sister and mother wanted to so I figure ok I get to see it for free so fine. I was really surprised that it was a little funny and it was ok. I would not see it again. And it is still not as good as The Mask, it is still an ok movie. Considering Jim Carrey isnt in it, its still ok. Traylor Howard is hot."
3,Silly and predictable,"This movie entertained the heck out of our 2 year old godson, that's all I was hoping for."
1,"Saw It Last Night, Talk About Boring","This movie flat out SUCKED. Why in the world did they make this? and Judging by the ending of the movie, they'll prob. make a third. PLEASE DON'T Stay away from this piece of crap movie people, get the first mask movie."
4,"Funny, Funny, Funny",My brothers and sister and I laughed the whole time we watched this movie. The things that the baby does are super funny! We have watched it about 20 times already and still love it.
2,An Average Film,"I wasn't as appauled by this film as most people were, although not nearly as good as the original, I didn't find it to be a complete waste of time. I enjoyed the Odin/Loki story, but that part of the story gets dull fast. The movie mainly focused on the baby and dog, both who weren't funny but very annoying. With all of that said, it does a few saving graces since I did find some of it to be funny. I would recommend this film for children and extreme fans of the Mask. Casual fans and older adults will have a hard time wanting to watch this movie after one viewing"
1,Not even worth a full paragraph of critical mauling,"Son of the Mask is an ugly, horrible, awful film. It's factory made with utter incompetance and has zero consistency with the original film. The CGI effects are the absolute worst, worst, WORST you will EVER, EVER, EVER see and the Mask character only appears twice for like 5 minutes in the whole film. Oh, please stay away! Stay well away from this hideous monstrosity! I'm sorry I can't say more but I have no words to aptly describe this worthless, pointless movie."
1,My all time WORST FILM EVER winner!!!,"So far it's been a rough time with movies getting worse with each comming year. But ever so rarely among the visual smut ,sinks a film that really demands our scorn and disgust!!!You need only read the other reviews of this film to see how much people hate it.Among the worst films in my ""worst films ever "" category this one tops the list!!!So congratulatios Mr.Guterman YOU just set the new low standard for america's most craptastic movies.(take bow and let us stuff this movie were it belongs)"
1,Could be the worst movie ever....,I don't even know what to say.... Jamie Kennedy is not funny. Alan Cummings is ...weird. The special effects are cheesy. The characters are ANNOYING. The music is like a drill in my ear. On the other hand my 8 year old son thinks it's great.
4,This movie rocks,I am a huge Jamie kennedy fan so I'm probably biased. But I thought he was great in this movie playing the Mask guy. It's about a cartoonist ( Jamie Kennedy) who's afraid of being a father but he has a baby after he puts on the Mask. The baby has Mask powers and he teaches Jamie and lesson or two in fatherhood. The scenes between Jamie Kenndy and the baby are so sweet!! And also really funny and bizarre. The other great character in this movie is the dog. It's insane! I really didn't know what to expect when I saw this in the theaters but I ended up laughing my butt off.
1,Need a 1 1/2 hour babysitter while you cook or clean?,"This is what this movie is for me! I have a 4 and 5 year old who saw this movie on the Cartoon Network and they thought it was hilarious! I thought it was the stupidest thing I have ever seen! I have the DVD ""The Mask"" and enjoyed it with my children because we LOVE movies with Jim Carey. So, I thought that this sequel could be some-what funny because of the theme and that the cast includes a baby with the power of the ""mask"". Again, this movie is ridiculously DUMB and I wanted to erase the memory from my brain, however, my children kept asking when it will come on the television again! So, I caved in and bought a used VHS of this film! As soon as my children get tired of it, I am going to use it to record television shows!"
1,DVD does not work,"I suspect this DVD, even though sealed in the case, was burned onto disk. It does not work, and there is a handwritten number on the CD."
3,Another nik-nak for my wife,Item is as it looks in the picture - she was less impressed with it than I was and thats what matters.
4,Well developed characters in an unusual time and setting,"I just finished the book and in general enjoyed it. The setting of Argentina during the Falklands war was a unique setting for a gay themed novel. I thought the characters were well developed and they evolved in ways that I was not expecting. The basic tale held my interest and toward the end it caught me my surprise. But, I do have to say the ending was a bit of a disappointment and rather left me hanging in the middle of a very dramatic situation. Nonetheless it is in the upper 10 percent of gay novels that I have read and I think that is high praise. I think few will be disappointed."
3,Little more than gay common places such as C.out & fashion.,"Must gay stories necessarily remain in the coming-out traumas and the fashion world? There's no doubt that this story is something more than this, like a Chilean I felt identified in many descriptions of the Argentinian dictatorship's time. But as a gay man I get the impression that in the ""gay literature"" there's no place for homosexuals who are not that trendy, handsome and rich like Richard or Pablo are. It's really pleasant to read this book, but I still haven't found in it the one who describes a homosexual like someone who comparts similar thoughts and preocupations like the rest of the mankind. I miss -like in every gay story I've read- the homosexual figure who's something more than a gay: a human being."
2,after a certain point. . .i couldn't pick it up.,"Toibin's prose is, technically speaking, above reproach, however, the total effect is bloodless and dispassionate. Perhaps I didn't give it enough of a chance, but if a book hasn't 'sparked' me by page 100, I put it down. One of the advantages, I guess, of non-required reading."
4,"betrayal, love, life and death","What a very gripping tale.

4,Classic Fleetwood Mac,"Dinky Dawson's tapes are legend, and they are well documented in hisbook ""Life On The Road"" (Billboard, with Carter Alan). ""Shrine '69"" is the first release in a ten year deal with Ryko Disc which should see live albums from The Kinks, Steely Dan, Lou Reed, and many others. This is just the first.The first time I saw Fleetwood Mac was on the Boston Common in 1972 - at that point Christine Perfect (McVie) was in the group and they were performing the ""Bare Trees""album, which I love. ""Shrine 69""was three years before that...recorded when I was 15 years of age...so to hear the band a fewyears before I got into them is a treat. Dawson's book comes to life with this disc, and it's my hope that more of his recordings see the light of day...Ryko could put out a ten CD set of the Live Fleetwood Mac and it wouldn't be enough for me. Dawson does with two tracks what some engineers can't do with 96..."
3,"A mediocre outing by the ""other"" Fleetwood Mac","It's unfortunate that it still needs to be explained to most people that there were TWO Fleetwood Macs: the famous Fleetwood Mac with Stevie Nicks, et. al., and the smokin' Fleetwood Mac with Peter Green. This recording captures the original blues band line up circa 1969. While it showcases many of the band's strengths (most notably Peter Green's guitar work) it's not really their best performance. A much better choice would be any of the three ""Boston Tea Party"" CDs which were originally recorded about a year after this L.A. appearance. If you're a fan of the original Fleetwood Mac, you'll probably want to buy this album just for the sake of completing your collection. But if you're new to this Fleetwood Mac - and you dig the blues - then you should pass this one up for now and go straight to ""Live at the Boston Tea Party Vol 1."""
5,Third cuts as deep as the first,Must we humans always cut someone else down just to pump someone else up. There is room for everyone and all kinds of talent on this earth. All versions of this band had vitality and worthiness...
5,laughing all the way,"Courierspeak is a multi-lingual phrase book for art handlers, curators, and couriers accompanying art across international boundaries. It's written by experts who have encountered every imaginable circumstance, accident, and catastrophe. The comic illustrations, featuring very funny frogs, are a delightful accompaniment to its useful text. A Michelin style format makes it easy to pack. This book would also make an unusual gift as a reference book for lovers of language. Smithsonian has done a public service by publishing a useful phrasebook for an admittedly slim market."
3,Too small,The description mentioned the size but I didn't realize just how small it was. Way too small and I can't find the larger sized of the book.
5,Very Pleased,"I purchased two units for the cabinet that is above our refrigerator. The cabinet was very deep and hard to organize and maximize the space inside. These work great for this purpose. These are heavy duty, and well constructed. I bought something similar at a home store with only one sliding shelf for the same price as this unit with two shelves. I would buy this again for sure."
4,Very solid cabinet,"The only problem we've had with this cabinet (we bought two) was trying to squeeze too much into it, as its strength implied infinite capacity! Aside from that, I highly recommend this as a way of making larger kitchen cabinets much more user-friendly."
4,Heavy duty with small problem,I was very pleased with the quality of this cabinet storage rack. Fit perfect. Heavy duty. The only problem I had was one of the braces that fit between the lower and upper baskets would not fit in the pre-drilled hole. I just took a rasp and filed around the end.
2,"""Iffy""","I ordered a few of these along with some 1156 models. They lasted a few months then noticed some flickering coming from them. Opened up the lighting fixture, found a few LED's dead and others going on and off. Checked the other ones I installed and they were doing the same thing. When I was removing them they literally fell apart.I guess the heat got to them. I live in Tucson, AZ so I would only recommend if you are in a cooler place.4 of about 15 ordered still work. The four that work are also flashers, which are not used full time."
1,Handle this with tweezers it's awful,"I have a deep sentimental attachment to the ORIGINAL version of this song by Gordon Lightfoot, so hearing this version really made me angry; Sundown (in it's original version) is a bittersweet tribute to an old love with gorgeous acoustic guitar and a mellow sound.This is nothing more than some idiot bragging about how he got laid.And, finally, if one chooses to re-make a song, they should do just that,re-make the song without sampling the original thereby demonstrating an enormous lack of talent and creativity."
5,Great Book,Great exercise plan. Only takes 10 minutes per day to be fit. Give it a try and see. Several levels.
4,pretty good,i gave this book as a present to a friend of mine. he seems to be doing great with it. it seems this is a great book for people who know nothing of the language. some external help with pronounciation would be good though.
1,not useful for beginners!,"I found this language set to be very confusing. The tape uses little english and requires reading the book while listening to the tape (not convenient). The tape skips around, for instance, will read a list of words in Bulgarian, but skips some of the words on the list! Then will begin the next section without warning!"
4,Excelente libro introductorio,"Entrega una gran cantidad de informacion introductoria sobre las cariables que influyen sobre la retencion de finos y fillers. Se hace especialmente enfasis en los tipos de ayudantes de retencion y los tipos de fillers a usar.Quizas le faltó hacer un mayor enfasis sobre la retencion en medio acido, pero en general lo recomiendo."
5,Nice Eye Candy,"If you have found this on Amazon, then it IS exactly what you are looking for. T & A beginning to end, lots of nudity, some relatively poor acting as would be expected. The women are beautiful, and take their clothes off (what little they are ever wearing) for what seems like almost no reason. Some lesbian action, but mostly just excellent tease nudity. Definitely what you would be looking for in this type of movie. On the SV spank-o-meter this film gets 9 out of 10."
1,Movie bit,"This movie sucks so bad. Yeah, the ladies were cute. Yet, it sucked so bad in so many ways. It was like, some bad movie students made this and the others."
4,Book of Babes - Bare Wench 2,The movie is good for watching gorgeous ladies and seeing son skin. Has a good plot. Only problem was the guy in it was sort of a nerd but the dvd was clear and worth a look at. A definite rental at least!
1,Truly Awful!,This DVD was a HUGE disappointment. It is filmed like a home movie (inexperienced camera person and all) but without any actual interaction with the RW/RW'ers. Instead what you get is a lot of stage shows from spring break with little or no audio. Save your $
4,Challange,This is a small but powerful book. It challenges us to look at society in a different way and to rise up and do something about it. We need to return to the values that this great country was based on. I also believe that we have fallen away from the morals this nation was founded on.When do we actually change? Only when we have our backs against the wall and we have to do something. This book puts us against the wall so we have to look at our lives. Not everyone enjoys being challenged. But the only way we usually do something is when we are challenged.
1,Strange little book....,"Carl Sommers claims that the cure for the deplorable moral decay of kids today is to teach them NOT to make their own moral judgements, NOT to question their own cultural values, and NOT to be tolerant of differing cultures/value systems. He claims that teaching kids 'too much' tolerance is teaching them not to condemn such evils as slavery. And yet he does not explain how slavery could have been eliminated from our own culture without people who questioned their own cultural values. Questioning cultural values is how we improve society. Without questioning, we stagnate as people and as a culture.I can't say that brainwashing kids to believe exactly as they are told can be seen as building character--quite the opposite."
3,Only for Windows 95/98!,"The platform info at the top of this Chessmaster 6K page indicates compatibility with ""Linux, Mac OS, Unix, Windows Me / 2000 / 95 / 98 / NT"". The program does not work with Macintosh. The 2 disks state "" WINDOWS 95/98"". So don't buy this if you think it's for multiple platforms."
1,Confused and dissappointed,"I bought myself a Chessmaster 6000 PC CD-Rom recently. I'm working on a Pentium 4 using Windows XP, but the game it seems is not compatible with XP - can u give some advice / help?Thanking you in advance"
4,Good game - if you have the right system,"I've had this Chessmaster for some time. Great fun. The only thing I would reiterate is that this is for Windows 95/98 only. Windows NT and 2000 will assuredly not work (check the chessmaster6000 website where they say so explicitly). With windows XP some people can get it to work, others not."
2,Still playing catchup,"This series has always been trying to catch up with the ""serious"" chess programs like Fritz, Hiarcs and Junior. With this release it has improved again but still lags behind. If you're older than 7 and so don't find the Disney style board the most important thing pony up a few more dollars and track down a copy of Fritz 6."
5,Excellent Costume,"We purchased this costume for a school Christmas play. Our child was the best looking elf in the play. Good Quality, it fit our 9 year old well. The shoe covers were almost to small for his shoes. But they worked well enough."
2,Vlad,"This game has a great design and excellent graphics. Unfortunately that's where the good stuff ends. It's very very simple and not challenging at all. I bought it for my 7 and 4 year old, hoping that they could both play it on different levels, but they were bored with it pretty quickly. They both went through it twice on the most difficult level (there are only three) and after that they didn't want to play it at all. The game doesn't go above single digits for additions and I haven't seen anything that use subtraction. Logic problem are very trivial too even for 4 year old.It's not a complete waste of money considering that it's not too expansive, but pretty close to it."
4,Does run under NT 4.0,"While the package says it is for Win 95/98, it does install and run under NT 4.0 (saying its NT 3.0 and I might have problems with NT) on my Dell 7500 laptop. The installer does want you to change to 256 color mode, but runs okay in 65,536 (16-bit) color mode.My 8 year old son loves this program."
4,Great reference!!!,"I am a professional horticulturist with a Masters degree in Horticulture from Penn State and I highly recommend this book as an easy-to-follow and accurate reminder of ""how to"" do landscape maintenance, like pruning. I will buy it and loan it ot my untrained friends so they can learn how to do it right (""teach a man to fish and he eats for a lifetime""). I highly recommend it. Plus, it's written by woman! A rarity in the field of landscape maintenance."
3,"Okay, but not all that good.","I didn't like this book very much, bucause in it, Modred's stone merges with an under-cover agent who gets Modred's memorys, but has amnesia. In this book, modred gets pretty much out of the rest of the series."
5,Soothing music for the soul,"I heard ""Lost in Space"" when I came to visit home and have craved for it since coming back here in the US. At first, I thought ""Sun in the Night"" and ""High"" were the only 2 other good songs in the CD, but all songs grew into me, notably ""When I was younger"" and ""Question of Faith"". The songs are notably subdued but has an uplifting effect. What an amazing achievement!"
5,OUTSTANDING,"THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM OF ALL TIME. TUNDE VOCALS ARE SUPERB WITH TRACKS LIKE RAINCLOUD, LOST IN SPACE, HIGH, QUESTION OF FAITH, SUN IN THE NIGHT. OH I MEAN THE WHOLE ALBUM IS TOP SCRATCH. THIS IS UNBELIEVE. I FIRST HEARD ABOUT IT AROUND MY AUNT'S AND FOUND IT SUPERB.PAUL TUCKER'S MUSIC IS REALLY EXCELLENT TO LISTEN TO AND TUNDE VOCALS AGAIN ARE THE BEST. THIS IS AN R'N'B/SOUL/POP ALBUM THERE EVER IS. THIS ALBUM IS MELLOW AND SUPERB.WELL DONE AND I HOPE YOU DO COME BACK WITH ANOTHER ALBUM."
4,Send yourself a Postcard,They did it again! 'Postcards from Heaven' is a brilliant piece of work! Pick it up and enjoy!
3,A couple of excellent songs,"I bought this CD after hearing ""high"". Overall it is good CD but again there are only a few hits."
5,A Classic,"I listen to all kinds of music, from pop to hard rock, but this album definitely places in my top five favorite albums. It's just great when you want to relax, take a long drive, or put on as background music during dinner.The album is incredibly uplifting and just makes you feel good. This is one of those rare finds that I can't believe wasn't a bigger hit in the U.S."
5,Excellent,"This album is incredible. It's mellow enough for easy listening, but uplifting with it's upbeat rhythems and lyrics. Tunde Baiyewu's voice is a gift to us all."
3,I'd give it 3.5 stars if possible. Some benefits but not a cure all.,"I took 2 bottles of this to see if it would lessen my need for a rescue inhaler or long term inhaler. It did not. It actually had very little noticeable effect. Yet it did keep me from needing to take Prednisone after a particularly nasty chest cold that exacerbated my asthma. I have a terrible reaction to Prednisone even in small doses.This product has a new California Proposition 65 warning label that says: This product contains chemicals known to the state of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm. I believe the ingredient known to cause harm is Shrubby Sophora, a concern if you are female and of reproductive age."
1,BEWARE OF BERNZOMATIC,"I have owned a Bernzomatic for two years. I was happy with it until it started failing to stay lit. That's when I found out that Bernzomatic does not sell parts, nor do they offer refferals for service. I live near a large city but can't find anyone to service it and it's only one year out of warranty. I'm going to have to trash it and buy a different brand after only two years.Consider your purhase of a Bernozomatic heater to be much like that of buying a very expensive Bic lighter."
1,Won't light,I have never had a worse performance out of any product I have purchased. I was able to light this heater twice in four months. The mfg. offered no help and we were unable to find anyone to repair the unit and we live in the 4th largest city in America! Do not buy this heater!
4,Boleros de oro,"This is a must...music of the Caribbeans and Cuba of a time when musicians of the islands were able to raom freely between Haiti, Cuba, Puerto Rico Curacao and Aruba. They were household names and part of the Caribbean cultural scene of the forties and the fifties"
3,"Eva Cassidy, No Boundries - Try her other works first","For the first time in my life I feel that I am a FAN of an artist rather than just someone who likes their music. I am speaking about Eva Cassidy, of course.I've only known about Eva since the May 19th Nightline story but I bought everything that I could find to include this album, No Boundries. Although it does indeed show the versatility of her amazing voice I must honestly say that it does not do her justice. Had I been unfortunate enough to have heard this album first I most likely would have ignored the rest of her work which is far, far better.If you are a newcomer to Eva's music I suggest you save this one for last. But, you will eventually want it all!"
1,should not have been released,"This is obviously a demo tape released as a cd of new music. It was probably recorded before any of the other albums. Remember: Eva's only goal was to be a session singer. This grouping is to showcase the songs by 2 songwriters, not Eva herself, --with Natural Woman thrown in for credibility. On every song she is reduced to SCREECHING and only her own background vocals are worth it--another kind of singer she only wanted to be. Notice the instruments are mainly synthesizers and sax. Leave producing Eva to Chris Biondo. Tony Taylor & David Christopher should be kicked out of the music business for trying to cash in--I think many of the other reviewers here feel the same. I'm returning my copy and keeping all the other Eva albums which I've listened to over and over. ...so glad I'm alive to be able to hear her."
1,Do not bother with this one,"Just to add to the many reviews already written...this is a ""departure"" from Eva's other CDs and it is a road not worth taking in this case. The songs are just bad, and the vocals, although very good, do not bring the feeling and intensity of her other CDs.I just recently learned about Eva and am now an avid fan and was truly disappointed by this...but by no means think any differently about Eva - she clearly did not have her heart in this."
1,I should have checked here first,"How disappointing. I snapped this up at the store because I hadn't seen it before. Should've realized that it was suspect, since there won't be any more recordings from this incredible artist. The production quality is poor, the songs very average and they do not justice to Eva Cassidy's vocal talent. I'm afraid we have to make do with the few other really good cd's we have and be thankful that at least they exist.Please do not grab this like I did, desperate for more."
1,Synth-Pop by third rate song writers,"I agree with ""A Music Fan""'s customer review. This is a travesty. If you've ever wondered what a fantastic voice would sound like surrounded by synth-pop sounds while singing really, I mean REALLY awful lyrics, this is for you. Get any Eva Cassidy CD but this one. As a matter of fact, I DO disagree with ""A Music Fan"" on one point... don't even bother stealing this from Napster... It wasn't worth the download time, and I'm on broadband."
1,Incredible voice wasted on trashy compositions,It's hard to believe that such an incredibl voice was wasted on such trashy songs. To put this side by side with Eva's other CD's is just for the purpose of cashing in on her recent popularity. No shame.
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"If this had been the first Eva Cassidy album I purchased, I would never have bought another and would have missed knowing one of the most marvelous voices in music. The songs here are awful, and the production is very artificial. This album is a disservice to Eva Cassidy. I listened twice and then threw it away. Fortunately, I can go back to other Eva Cassidy albums which I play over and over."
2,Unauthorized release of her music,"I recently read that this album was released over ""strenuous objections"" from Eva Cassidy's family. As someone previously commented, she never would have released these cuts to the public. I suppose there is always a market for unauthorized biographies and disc's, but it seems a shame that listeners ""blame"" Eva for poor quality of an album she had nothing to do with."
1,Telling it straight: DON'T buy it; save your money!,"If I could give this CD zero stars, I would. I own all but one of Eva's other releases and treasure them all. ""No Boundaries"" is overproduced pop drivel that Eva surely would not have wanted released were she still with us today. Trust me and the other reviewers who say they love Eva's other work but have been profoundly disappointed by this one. It's just not the Eva that we know and love.In short, if you're new to Eva, start with SONGBIRD or LIVE AT BLUES ALLEY. You can't go wrong with either of those. If you're an Eva fan who has her other releases, do your wallet a favor and skip this one."
2,Eva does easy listening,"I am a massive Eva Cassidy fan. I have bought all her CD's (beginning after a chance encounter seeing her perform live in an Annapolis tavern [in 1996?]). As everybody observes, she was an extremely versatile performer, bravely applying her vocal talent to a wide range of music genres.On this CD, however, the result does not at all work for me. It sounds a bit like the background track to a banal teen romantic comedy. Comes complete with the Kenny-G-esque sax treatment.Eva cannot reach the sublime plane with this kind of junk food style music the way she can with her remarkable Jazz, Blues and Gospel numbers. My guess is that if she were alive she never would have let this one get released. It probably shouldn't have been."
5,No Boundaries (early Eva Cassidy CD),"Fantastic! Fast, well packed and in terrific condition. I'd do business with these folks again with NO hesitation!Thanks!Amazon.com is awesome!Poof!Old RickBTW: I'm very sorry that Ms. Cassidy isn't around to sing anymore....I've never met a soul who didn't LOVE her voice. She's an important songstress!And she's too often overlooked. I'm glad you folks had this early collection."
1,"please listen before buying, it's awful!","after listening to this cd a couple of times i still can't understand why anyone should recommend it. it has nothing to do with eva's voice and talent as i've come to know and love it. i have a very broad musical taste and i am always interested when an artist tries to explore new musical areas, so it wouldn't bother me to hear eva sing more poppy or mainstream songs. but on this cd she simply sounds terrible. just listen for yourself and decide. don't just order it because it has eva's name on it, like i did. i couln't get rid of it fast enough....!"
3,"More hip, less Eva...","Eva departs from her other albums and basic genre: on No Boundaries she has back-up vocals, soprano sax backgrounds, more manufactured and synth music. Three items on this CD are repeated (as a radio edit or reflection), so you get only 8 songs."
1,a true disappointment,"I fell in love with Eva Cassidy and her voice. After listening to Songbird, I had to go out and buy more of Eva's CD's. Unfortunately, I bought 'no boundaries'. What a waste of money! She said herself that she wanted to do any kind of music except that ""pop junk"". That is exactly what this is. I felt like I went back in time to 1985! This is not something she would have wanted to come out as a CD. Don't waste your time and money like I did!"
2,"Sorry Eva, you are still my favorite","I can probably understand why this CD was released. Eva's short life has left her biggest fans missing her and her wonderful sounds. This recording does not have the songs that give Miss Cassidy's gift its due. They are very sentimental and never do not develop the groove Eva fans are so used to.Anyways, everything else she has done to date is a five star act. Note, her 'Songbird' cd is a compilation of her first 3 recordings..."
1,I sadly agree - don't waste your money,"A couple of years ago, I heard a beautiful voice at the local Virginia dance recital and I was entranced. A couple of days later, I went to buy the tape of this vocalist - which didn't exist. However, I wanted to hear this voice again, I ended up buying my first Compact Disc Stereo and my first CD - Eva Cassidy's ""Live at Blues Alley"". I think it is pretty clear that I adore Eva Cassidy. This album, unfortunately, is truly disappointing. The songs are predictable, the lyrics unimaginative, and Eva is not fully engaged - not like her other work. Don't let this one bad album ruin your whole collection."

5,MCLEOD'S DAUGHTERS COMPLETE THIRD SEASON,I HAVE ALL THE SEASONS NOW AND EVERY ONE IS GREAT. LOVE THIS SERIES. DVDS ARE REALLY GOOD. BUY AND ENJOY
5,Love it,Me and my daughter just can't get enough. We watch one episode every day. I think this season is worth every penny.
1,McLeod's Daughters Season 3 - unhappy,I am sure this DVD is just fine. I wouldn't know because I didn't open it. I bought it for a giftee who already found it elsewhere. I contacted you and have heard nothing. Please contact need to return this item.
4,"Helpful, but definitely a secondary source","Bettina Knapp's monograph on Anais Nin is helpful and interesting. I particularly appreciate the description of surrealism, as well as the history of the movement. This helped me understand Nin's HOUSE OF INCEST. But overall I'd have to say that Knapp's book should be viewed as a secondary source for interpreting Anais Nin's oeuvre. While I appreciate Knapp's positive approach to Nin (a breath of fresh air after some of the anger I've seen directed at Anais), sometimes the writing is just a bit too worshipful, a bit too much of an advocate stance. Rumor has it that Anais Nin herself even helped Knapp prepare this book, so the stance should come as no surprise. Therefore, I would recommend turning to Benjamin Franklin's ANAIS NIN: AN INTRODUCTION first, and then to Knapp's ANAIS NIN. While Franklin is definitely a fan of Anais Nin, he was not afraid to critique her work, pointing out that it was not always successful."
1,Mavis Beacon,"The case was cracked when it arrived, and it seems to have a glitch, because it stops suddenly a lot of the time. If I am able to return it I would.Regards Harry"
5,Holy Grail of Renaissance Christmas Music,"Taking performances into account, there is no finer musical compliation of renaissance christmas music than this. A holiday favorite and desert island listening material. Don't let this one slip you by!"
3,Content fine - Kindle layout appalling,The Kindle version of this book is visually appalling - parts of the text scales with changes in font size; other blocks of text appear as unscalable images. Stick with a print edition until Amazon can get their act together.
5,Great Bargain,"When the bidding on e-bay went sky high for the same item, I was pleased to find it at Amazon for a reasonable price.The book is in super condition and I am very happy"
5,Seductive,Put this album with a bottle of wine and someone you love and you have a formula for a great evening. Naoko's vocals and musical arrangements give new life to some great jazz classics. Naoko proves that technical competence equals top notch entertainment. Naoko is accompanied on this CD by some of the best jazz talent in the industry. What a combination of talent! It clearly comes though in a delightfully spellbinding album. I highly recommend this album to anyone and look forward to more from this talented artist.
5,Kaito - Hundred Million Love Years,"If Kaito's _Hundred Million Light Years_ was cemented to the ground by its rhythms, then _Hundred Million Love Years_ has been completely unmoored from its surroundings an drifts effortlessly into your consciousness. The removal of the beats allows the expanded tones to linger more than before, even as it also, unfortunately, reveals some synth pads that border on cheesy -- like on ""Nobody Could Be Alone."" But for the most part, the music feels seamless and undistracting. The previously frenetic ""Holding a Baby"" becomes a meditation; ""The Universe"" passes by not on hyperspace, but on languidspace. The new track, ""Soul of Heart"" may sound like a tautology, but there's nothing redundant on the track. The move from light to love was brilliant."
3,REFERENCE LIBRARY OF WORLD CIVILISATION,"A reference library in true sense - you can see, scan, read and browse. Only regret I have is that we can't take good prints of the beautiful pictures for which NGS is famous for.It had been my lifetime dream to possess all NGS issues and to that extent this collection fulfils the requirement. The presentation of the package could have been better - more compact (with 31 CDs the package can be made less than 50% of the present volume), easy to access a particular CD and sturdy. After all the people who buy this collection are not the 'use-and-throw' type of people - they revere and respect the effort that has gone into making it a reality. The hundreds of man-years which have gone into it deserve better treatment.Another good thing about it is it gives good historical review of technological products like cameras, automobiles and electronics - through advertisements."
5,Student Prince plus.........,"This vinyl LP has the full Student Prince operetta, plus 6 additional tunes from Mario's catalog that are pretty rare and not found on most of his assorted CD hits packages.A must for the collector of his music in all formats."
2,"Decent for the price, which in my case was under $100, delivered","I needed an inexpensive women's coaster brake bike (I live in an area with a high rate of bicycle theft) and purchased the ""Elvis"" bike when it was about $95, delivered. For that price, I have no complaints. The bike arrived in good shape, and the design is amusing if you're an Elvis fan. The down side is that it's hard to keep the seat adjusted (it slowly slides down as you ride it so you have to readjust it every few miles) and it makes a noise that suggests the tire is rubbing on the frame (which it isn't). I'm also not sure it passes the ""too cheap to be worth stealing"" test, because it is rather eye-catching. Also, it's heavy, which is fine with me because I'm riding to get exercise. However, the average woman would probably not want to have to carry it up a flight of stairs."
4,Defines a teacher's heart,"This book is great for anyone who has not realized what teaching really means. The author is clear about the reason for teaching - not to impart information only, but to evoke changes in people's lives. This book is also good for giving ways to do this. His teaching methods are clear.I recommend this for all new teachers and for any experienced teachers who do see changes in theirs students' lives as the normal result of their teaching."
4,an insightful book for serious teacher,"It is an insightful book for serious teachers. The author is an experienced Bible teacher with wide exposure in teaching around the world. The 7 laws are well-tested and deserve a place as a reference for serious teachers. It provides a comprehensive approach with emphasis on maxims, illustration, and steps for application. It is a good tool to help those teachers who have a passion to transform students into an active learner.#1 the law of the learner#2 the law of expectation#3 the law of application#4 the law of retention#5 the law of need#6 the law of equipping#7 the law of revival"
5,Great book!,"I was looking for a book on Christian Education and this book was referred to me. I am nearly 70 pages into it and I like the book a lot! It's a great read. Plus, I couldn't turn down the description and the price. This will be a permanent collection in my library."
2,The Seven Laws of the Learner,"If you like late-night TV salesmen, then this book is for you. Although there are some excellent points made, more than half of the book is garbage. Devoid of scholarship and full of highly questionable anecdotes. As a Christian, I'm ashamed that another Christian wrote a book like this. Don't be fooled. Don't buy this book."
1,Teach ANYTHING to anyone?! I don't think so!,"These books have the most misleading titles! Unless you are teaching Sunday school bible classes, this book is mostly useless, because the only examples it gives you are about how to better teach the bible. The title says 'teach almost anything to pratically anyone'. That is so NOT TRUE. Sure, it gives you some pointers, but I feel I have to squeeze the text really hard to get some juice.I bought this book and 'Almost Every Answer for Practically Any Teacher' hoping to learn how to teach better, and to get in touch with modern teaching skills. What a disappointment and a waste of money! The other book went straight to the garbage can.Another thing: if all the examples of bible teaching were stripped out of the book, it would be half the size and, perhaps, a much more pleasurable read. Maybe it would even earn another star!"
5,7LL Users Review,"Three years ago, our church of about 1,000 set about to reinvent itself within our Christian Education department. At about 26,000 feet flying somewhere over Arizona, I was shaken while reading it for the first time. It shocked me into realizing how really boring many teachers can communicate without anyone learning anything...always pushing content while omitting any application or creativity to ensure learning. These principles revitalized my own teaching, and I have used it as our core curriculum for the 15 teachers we have in our education department. Our teachers have come up with some great classes as well as creative ideas in their professional/occupational lives as a result of this book.Going on year three, we stand by this book as the best-of-class, and continue using its principles weekly. We now have a growing and alive ministry, and can honestly say this book began it all. This book is a ""must"" if you want to change lives vs. ""cover"" the material."

5,The Classic Sandals,"If do you need a very comfortable shoes, the answer is Birkenstoks.im buying a second par or birkies these year, becouse my other par is with me since 1991!! 12 years."
1,there are much better books on this topic,"This memoir read like an article that was stretched out into an entire book. It was not a particularly interesting memoir or a good book on the topic of OCD or Tourette's. It was long-winded, obvious, and stale."
5,"A fascinating, captivating read.","I read about this book in a number of magazines and finally went out and bought it. I was amazed by how well it was written -- honest, open, funny and smart -- and by what a great perspective the writer had, not only on her own experiences with Tourette syndrome and OCD but on life in general. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who likes quality nonfiction about fascinating subject matter -- and I really look forward to this writer's next output. This is a keeper, and a book to share with all of your discriminating reader friends and family."
5,Absolutely THE BEST book out there on TS and OCD.,"I am engaged to a man with TS/OCD and, as our wedding nears, I have become an avid reader on the subject. I have read just about every book written on the subject and Amy Wilensky's Passing for Normal is in a class by itself. Since first reading it a few months ago, I have purchase 3 copies as gifts! Amy Wilensky is the first author I've encountered who has successfully articulated what it ""feels like"" to live with these disorders. For the first time, I have a much better understanding of what it would be like to have TS/OCD. For me, this understanding has been absolutely invaluable. Thank you Amy."
3,good memior,this was good because the author did not pity herself all the way through she was not all like woe is me i have tourrettes.i found this a very enjoyable read. i recommend it.
5,Really great book!,"My friend who knows the author lent me this book, and I actually went out and bought it for myself after I'd had a chance to read it.I'm in medical school so the subject matter was inherently interesting, but I was surprised by what a good read it was in a general way--she's a really talented writer, and the pace is perfect. This is definitely a keeper."
2,Workmanlike.,"My wife has Tourette's, so perhaps I came to this book expecting something more. Despite the title, it's clear that Ms. Wilensky not only ""passed"" but was, for all intents and purposes, able to lead a mostly normal life, something my wife could not do until her thirties. It's also hard to sympathize too much with the author's privileged, sheltered upbringing--far from making her life a living hell, the Tourette's appears to have given her a certain cache in a world where (by her own description) it seems that a woman's worth was measured by the severity of her eating disorder. Ms. Wilensky is thoughtful enough, but this book lacks a certain depth. Perhaps it's distance on her adolescent self-absorption."
5,"Finally, someone who understands!","When I read Amy Wilensky's book, I immediately started crying- finally, here was a bright young woman who had every aspect of her life together except for perhaps the most important part- she had a disease she didn't understand. That was me! I too had suffered from this illness, passing for normal and undiagnosed. To read this book for me was like a light coming on in the darkness, and her willingness to sahre her struggle gave me the strength to move on with my life. Amy, you deserve more than just a good review- you deserve a worldwide hug!!"
3,The film is good; the DVD-R transfer is...,"Iben Hjejle is a fine actress; really strong and with an incredible range. In this film, she has an opportunity to show what she can do; but unfortunately, her performance was nearly ruined for me as a result of the very poor transfer to DVD-R that amazon sent me. It was out of sync from the middle of the film to the end. For $12.99, I think the film should at least be in sync!"
4,homosexual lyrics??,"First of all...i read all the lyrics...and i don't see how they are at all promoting homosexuality. I am a Christian as well and by no means do I condone homosexuality, but I am in no position to judge homosexuals because we are all sinners and have fallen short of the glory of God. And for those of you bashing this CD for supposedly supporting homosexuality, how come you don't have anything to say about all the music that promotes drunkenness or pre-marital sex which are also a sins according to he Bible, that even many ""Christians"" tend to ignore? Before you bash homosexuals, why don't you first worry about not getting wasted at the kegger down the street or keeping it in your own pants (unless you are married of course)."
1,A stinking pile of POO,My sister constantly listens to this stuff. I hate it. I wish she would stop. This is her favorite band. This band sucks. The cd is a stinky pile of poo.
5,Gorgeous Rampal,"Jean-Pierre Rampal, besides being an incredible flute player, was obviously fond of Japanese folk music. He conveys this beauty in these incredible renditions of Japanese melodies that are both breathtaking and beautiful.I won't deny the fact that it's clear that Rampal is playing on a European style flute. It's very obvious. However, does that stop these tunes from being amazing? Absolutely not. The Western harp doesn't change anything too. The mood is perfect, and Rampal's drastic differences from low notes to high notes (besides being very difficult and executed perfectly) give the music a Japanese feel. Yes, that's a harp, and yes, it's a Western flute, but the result is simply breathtaking. The mood is perfect, the music is beautiful, and the playing is flawless.It's not played on a Japanese flute, but it's just as beautiful. It's different, lovely, and a wonderful disc to listen to at any time. At this price, it's a DEFINITE buy. Enjoy!"
5,Japanese Flute And Harp- Exquisite!,"Simply put, if you like the flute and the harp, and a [usually] very pronounced Japanese style, give this album a chance. From the beginning to the end it is relaxing and compelling, without any duds. Like being rocked in a hammock, your cares melt away. There is just something about the harp and the flute, each softly beckoning to us on their own, but here they are paired with very good results. Exquisite."
5,Incredible Book,"You don't really have to be from New York to buy this. It's a very nice history of the individuals who populate the Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. I picked it up after my first trip[ to Green Wood and found it very useful on the second trip. Though it lacks much in the way of maps to find the markers were you planning to seek them out, it is lavishly illustrated with short biographical bits on the more prominent people there mixed into a history of the cemetery."
4,Pain Therapy-The pain Cure Alternative,this well written book about magnet therepy fo pain was very healful in helping the reader understand how magnetic therapy works to reduce pain in the human body. Covers the entire scope magnetic therapy pain reduction alone with some technical data that is easy to follow. A really great book for anyone who wants to understand how this kind of pain releif works.
2,Disappoinment,"Maybe I am just not the philosophical kind of person who finds this type of book attractive. As a Baby Boomer, I found some of the references to Boomer culture and marketing interesting..but I just did not get the author's intended message from this book...whatever the message was intended to be. If you are deep into philosophical discussions maybe this book is for you."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"THIS DVD IS A FRAUD!!! I JUST RECEIVED MY ORDER TODAY AND I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS ITEM!!!! FIRST, IT WAS NOT WHAT IT CLAIMED TO BE---IT DID NOT FEATURE GN'R LIVE!!!! IT WAS A SERIES OF POORLY RECORDED, BOOTLEG GN'R VIDEOS THAT I ALREADY HAVE---THE LEGITIMATE VERSION! THEN IT HAD A BUNCH OF OTHER ARTISTS I AM NOT INTERESTED IN (LIKE THE LONDON QUIREBOYS---WHO ARE THEY ANYWAY?) AND IT WAS ALSO POORLY EDITED. I FEEL LIKE I WAS RIPPED OFF AND I WILL BE SURE NOT TO BUY FROM MOVIE MARS AGAIN!!!!! IF YOU ARE A TRUE GN'R FAN DO NOT BUY THIS DVD---JUST BUY THEIR VIDEO COLLECTION AT LEAST THAT DVD DOES NOT SKIP IN PLACES AND CUT THE BEGINNING AND END OF EACH VIDEO OFF!"
1,This is Rubbish!,"This is Rubbish, Rubbish, Rubbish!!!!!! So called Live, just cutting sence here and there from various live and video, but not a real continuous live! Much worse, only 4 G&R's songs on this DVD!!!!!! Other materials including Whitesnake, London Quireboys and Posion, also cutting bits from here and there! This is issued to trap G&R's fans!!!!!!!"
2,Permanent Damage!!,"Being a HUGE fan of previous JSBX works, I was GREATLY let down by Plastic Fang. I tried to just put it deep in the CD collection and wait for happier days. Now ""Damage"" arrives, and perhaps it should have been named ""Permanent Damage"". It really is a mixture of ""Plastic Fang"" (i.e. not really just all about the emotion of the moment, but rather JSBX trying to make..dare I say...ACTUAL songs with lyrics..) and a rehash of all the ""good"" stuff of the previous albums (i.e. super raw rock-n-roll!!).When I hear Chuck D yelling ""BASS!"", 14 years after the fact, and JS doing his little same deal, I'm thinking...""That's it? That's the new album?"". I want to really like these guys, but just can't get into it. I'll spot them one additional star just for the memories."
2,The albums just can't match the live show,"These guys are becoming a live show only band. I love the band, but try to turn somebody onto them by playing one of their recent albums. They will not come away impressed. The Blues Explosion needs to just start putting out live albums or something. I guess you can only put out so many albums like Orange before changing, but change for change's sake just doesn't always work."
5,EXCELENTE PELICULA!!!,"ES UNA GRAN PELICULA MEXICANA FILMADA EN EL VALLE DE TEXAS Y CIUDAD CAMARGO, TAMAULIPAS (DIZQUE SAN FELIPE TORRES MOCHA, GUANAJUATO -EN ESTA PELICULA).SALUDOS, Y VEANLA!!!!SE LAS RECOMIENDO AL 100%."
3,"Feminist analysis of ""Citizen Kane""","Laura Mulvey writes well, and her analysis of ""Citizen Kane"" is, in several aspects, a joy to read. But, for an in-depth coverage of the subject, I really recommend Ronald Gottesman's ""Focus on Citizen Kane"", or, better yet, his ""Perspectives on Citizen Kane"", which I think should be required reading on the film, along with Carringer's ""The Making of Citizen Kane"". In other words, if you needed to read just one book on the subject, this one would not be it."
3,Succinct analysis; a bit too psychobabble for my taste,"Nice little bit of analysis. Brought out aspects of the film I had never noticed before. Could have done without all the Freudian interpretation, but I suppose that reflects contemporaneous literary analysis."
4,FOnd Memories of Years Gone By,"In the mid to late seventies I was greatly influenced by my older sister's record collection. Through her I had my first savory taste of Pink Floyd, Cat Stevens and Rick Wakemen. So when, in 1978, she married and moved away, I found myself lacking for more ""adult"" music than what was available on the local AM radio stations. After a couple of years I went to visit my sister and her husband, and while there checked out their music. What I found was an absolute marvel; Dave Mason - Let it Flow. As an amateur musician I lost myself in Dave's intricate playing. And, as a normal male in his early twenties, Dave's lyrics really hit home; heartache, loss and hope all resonate with Mason's voice. This is an excellent album that I highly recommend to anyone that has any appreciation of ""good"" music."
5,Such a soothing CD - great buy,"I saw Dave Mason recently in concert and the songs brought back such great memories. I used to have this LP. I had to get the CD and now it's on my computer, my MP3 Player and in my car.Dave sounded as wonderful today as he did 20 some years ago."
1,I did not get my book,I ordered a book from stevens_kaleidoscope - Amazon Marketplace and did not get it in the mail. I received a gift card from Amazon for the amount of the book instead of charging it back to my Amazon Credit Card account. I will try go get it from Amazon or another source.
2,Needs work with html,"When a definition references a comparison to/with another definition, there's no html to jump to the new definition."
1,What does liar mean in tom's dictionary,"Please do not waste your money, the author does not back up his obviously republican views in this book."
5,a time in history worth revisiting,"Being born and raised in the South, I feel that this book is very educational for everyone to read.The author writes about his life and all the trial and tribulations of growing into a man during a period of time that only few remember and talk about.He makes it easy for readers to follow the story with his easy in writing and such interesting information! I enjoyed the book and hope that everyone takes the time to read this book.I think you will be glad you did."
1,Where is the value,This book was written by and for academics. Many of the examples are taken from one source in a company and show know real insight into creating value.
5,Peabody & Sherman,"I used to look forward to watching this show when I was a kid,still looking forward to seeing it now!"
5,Classic Cartoons,These are great for those who don't have a great imagination. This is a great classic cartoon that I highly recommend to anyone and everyone.
5,Long live the Way-back machine!,"This delightful, smartly written cartoon is not just funny, it's a great way to get kids into history. Mr. Peabody's complete self-confidence never wavered and was completely believable. His boy, Sherman, was delightfully inquisitive on their adventures. I watched this religiously as a kid, and was thrilled to find it on DVD to give to my history-major daughter. It's a great break from the mundane, and reminds us that history is still relevant."
4,Mr. Peabody and Sherman,"If you remember the Rocky and Bullwinkle clan then you'll remember Mr. Peabody and Sherman. Your kids will enjoy his somewhat skewed view of historical events just as we did. The Wayback Machine is working just as well as before! Older kids may not find it as fun, but still will enjoy looking at history at a different angle."
5,Review of Boudicca,I found the book very informitave not dry yet sensitiveto the plight of Celtic Britan. The working backwords is paramount as the only sources for theBoudiccdan revolt were Roman and extracting and interplatinginformation from the prejudices of Roman society had towardswomen is extreamly valuable. Also the knowledge of the Roman emperiors of the period has caused interest in thesepersonalities which will promt more research on my part.Extreamly inlightening reading.
3,"Good, but pricey for its vintage","The book has some helpful tips, but it is very dated for the price (particularly when you get the rush shipping, but that was my fault). Technology wise, it glosses over digital photography as some futuristic dream that is still years away unless you have a newsroom budget (a newsroom budget from the early 90's mind you).The tips for the business side also don't take into account the changes that have occurred in both photography or the music industries (ie selling and protecting your work in the digital age).The tips for actually taking pictures are helpful, but can be found any of the more recent photography books.Though the book has some great images in it, unless it was updated I couldn't recommend it as useful guide in todays market."
4,Finally found some help......,"I believe that this book will be the nearest thing that will specifically speak about concert photograhy. I recently got into concert photography. I needed a book to help me figure out certain things like low light photography, equipment, ect. I've bought other low light photography books but they were never as specific as this one. I can definitly say that I learned a lot. I wish Sievert would have spoken a bit more about digital photography but overall it has great methods and technics for you to have a basic understanding of concert photography."
3,"nice book, but too dated","Interesting book and some great pics by someone who obviously has experience in the industry, but it's very datedA much better and more current option is:All Access: Your Backstage Pass to Concert Photography"
1,Wish I coulda played Spidey,This game disc never played & still doesn't play even to this day in my PS3 game console. I wish I coulda had the chance to return it
2,"Gets boring real fast, super short","I finished the game fairly quickly without trying too hard. Just like an earlier reviewer mentioned, what you have to do is pretty much the same on every mission. Some of the ""chase the bad guy"" missions are super frustrating. Its an OK game, definitely rental material."
2,A great game ruined by bugs,"The game continuously freezes up in boss battles. This could just be the PS2 version, but it occured with multiple discs. After researching this online I've found it is a very common problem. If a little more effort was put into debugging the game it would be a 4 star game, but as it stands it is practically unplayable."
2,Waste of 50 bucks,"To me this game was a HUGE disappointment, I spent 50 dollars on this game and there is hardly anything to do with it. Unless your into doing the same thing over and over and over again then go ahead and waste your money. but all you do is be spider man, chase a guy, the guy hurts civilians, save the civilians, chase some more, than fight the guy. Thats all you do as spiderman. and as venom you chase, run away, and fight. Nothing more to it. sure there are the city events and races but those are boring. Not to mention the game can be beat within an hour. The only thing remotely fun is swingin around the city, and even that gets old after 15 minutes. I do have to give credit to the graphics though, they're pretty good. But if you wanna spend 50 dollars on a game that takes an hour to play go ahead, otherwise I suggest waiting until the price drops down to 10 bucks."
1,Terrible and horrifying.,"PARENTS--KEEP YOUR CHILDREN AWAY! Unless of course your children like seeing kids their own age slaughtered. That's what Venom does. Plus all the bad language. Oh, and the jogger who get pulled into the bushes by Venom's tentacles and killed by him, all the while screaming. Even Spidey himself has his bad points by frequently using the word ""suck."" I have always personally hated the Ultimate Spider-man comics for thier gore and violence, and the game is just as bad, if not worse."
2,Don't like it,"This is a game for kids under the age of 13. It has cool comic book style cut scenes but the actual gameplay is short, simplistic, and either way too hard or way too easy. And no you don't get to freeroam with Venom. You can only use him as part of storymode. I've been a huge spidey fan for well over 10 years but this game was a total letdown. If you're still in middle school you might like it. Anyone else should stick with Spiderman 2 or get the new X-Men Legends instead."
5,Terrific for empty nesters!,"I really like this book, and I saw the Arps present the essence of it at a live seminar they gave. Many couples surround their whole existence with the kids, and then when the kids are gone they are not connected to each other like the good old days.This book provides a way to start dating and having fun again while you grow together. You do not fight on the dates, you just follow their lead and address things you may not have talked about for a very long time. It may sound mechanical, but we have seen firsthand how fun this can be. It's refreshing to enjoy each other, talk about your second half of marriage and what is important to you as individuals and as a couple at this stage.In the last chapter you decide whether or not both of you want to buy and live in an RV for the rest of your lives. Just kidding. Love the book--they do a great job making dating and intimacy easy at any stage of life. Another thumbs up!"
3,He's fallen off!!!!!!,"Juvenile used to have the kind of music that made you wanna get up and dance or act crazy. You know the tight beats that Mannie Fresh put down mixed with that one of a kind voice. But this album is a lot different. Mannie Fresh only produced a couple of songs on this album and Juvenile seems like he is trying to be some kind of Jamaican rapper. I dont understand why he changed his style. Some of the good or decent songs on here are In My Life, Slow Motion feat Soulja Slim (RIP), Bounce Back, and a few others. I jsut seems like when juvenile does put down a tight flow the chorus sucks or when the beat is tight his flow doesn't match up. It all just seems mixed up and out of place, I gave it 3 stars because of the few good songs and because Juveniles lyrics are still at his top level."
4,Juvenile he on fire!!!!,"Ight this album is fire from the intro.Ok this aint no 400 degrees.Face it their'll never be anotherone.This is a 2003 classic.Juvenile is soundin nice for a comeback album.Im feelin it.Holla at cha boy!!!Juve holdin it down for us New Orleans natives.UPT 4 life,3rd ward"
4,pretty good cd,"pretty good.the best songs are in my life f/mannie fresh,bounce back f/baby AKA birdman,down south posted f/wacko & skip, it ain't mines, and slow motion f/soulja slim{r.i.p.}"
3,Juve The Great...,"Despite what many think...Juvenile has always been a prolific rapper teaching lessons through his ghetto street tales. Juvenile was never a generic by the mills rapper and always had something to say. With that said this album is subpar...however it is better than his last Cash Money album Project English but it doesn't have a 'hit' or a must hear type of song. All of the songs are solid; that is they have good lyrics and nice beats. But there is no PUNCH. There is no HOOK. Nothing draws me into the album, nothing to make me say ""time to listen to that new Juvie"". The first four songs In My Life, Enemy Turf, Down South Posted and Bounce Back are the only songs with some fire to them. Don't get me wrong I am a big Juvenile fan (400 Degreez & G-Code were classics) and was on his side through all the Cash Money & Wayne Beef, but his new album just isn't very good. 2.5 Stars."
3,ight album thats it,"I like how Juve is raw and uncut he has lyrics like you wont hear from anyone else such as show me the poopshooter lol....i think his old cd's are better though, this cd has a few good songs i the tracks in my life, bounce back, f****n with me, juve the great isnt bad, and head in advance is probably my favorite along with f***n with me, I think there's too many skits and not enough music.....I've also got the new big tymers big money heavyweight and i also dont think its as good as hood rich or others besides a few hot joints on it like off the wall and #17 i cant think of the name of my head it looks like cash money just isnt puttin out that much good stuff they're just living off their name..If you're looking for a hot cd with all nice tracks your best bet is G-UNIT or anything prduced by dre, sha money XL or 50"
4,Excellent!,I was never a big fan of Juvenile but this album is off da chain!!Thats all I have to say peace out!
5,SELF EXPLANITORY- JUVE THE GREAT!,"JUVE'S MY FAVORITE RAPPER AND I DONT CARE WHAT CD HE PUTS OUT, ITS STILL GONE B TIGHT TO ME. I'VE LISTENED 2 ALL OF HIS CD'S AND HAVEN'T BEEN DISAPPOINTED YET. JUVE THE GREAT IS A TIGHT A$$ CD. U BETTA COP IT, IF NOT, THEN U GOT A PROBLEM."
3,slow motion...,slow motion is the best song on the album....simply because of soulja slim....even if u dont buy the album....get this song!
5,Juve Is The Great,"This album is as hot as 400 Degreez! Its good to hear him with that Cash Money sound! Nice beats and Juve handled the rest! FIRE! Only problem is that Mannie isnt on their lyrically enough! But still a banger! Go get that 600 Degreez too! I know you thinkin ""Doesnt he mean 400?"" NO, there is a 600 Degreez!R.I.P. Soulja Slim"
5,Best of his Cds!,This is the best of Juvenile's cds and I had to rebuy this cd just because of that reason! I can listen to this cd from start to finish!
1,"""Lyrics""",I rated the album because of the garbage lyrics the Juvenile wrote across the beats. The beats were excellent but the lyrics suck. Manny Fresh should take his talent & give it to raw lyrices like Jay-Z or Kayne West.
3,"sHe's MoiNe, NoT yOuRs BuT sHe's MoiNe, aND sHe's NoiCe","I find this album to be too laid back, Juve didn't come at you like he did some what in In My Life. This album can't compete with G-Code and sho nuff can't be mentioned in the same sentence as 4oO. Only songs worth listening to is In My Life ((best song on album)), Bounce Back. For Everybody has a NoiCe slowed down chorus. But Im not really feeling this album. If it's your last 15 bucks, buy something else."
3,Decent.,"I Like Juvenile, so when i heard he was finally coming back i was ready to cop the album. I was a bit dissapointed. First, he has too many skits. The album seemed long when i got it but it really isn't, since theres 3 skits. They're not cute/funny/good. So yeah. Plus, it doesn't seem like he doesn't know about much besides sex & drugs. I don't know what else i was expecting, but even though it's about sex & drugs, he puts a different spin on it.Highlights:- Numb Numb (this song is ADDICTIVE!!! No doubt, the best song on the CD. It's about drugs but he talks about getting clothes for his daughter, but yeah, the beat alone makes it good).- In My Life (first single, you've heard it. I didn't like it at first. It grew on me).- Bounce Back (a little annoying at first, but it grew on me. Features Baby).- Slow Motion.Everything else is decent. But it's still worth the money, or download off itunes."
5,DIS IS BEAST,YO DIS CD IS SO TIGHT ITS SHOULD BECOME A NATIONAL ANTHEM OD THE U.S HE TALK BOUT HIS SUCESS AND HIS STRUGGLES AND NUMB NUMB IS THE BEST SONG ON HERE I LUV DIS CD ITS THE BEST GO IT RIGHT NOW
2,Juve The Terrible,"I was expecting good from this album, but I was wrong. This album is crap. There is only 2 good songs on it. (Slow Motion, In My Life) Instead of this, pick up Juve's best album 400 Degreez"
1,This Sucks,"This CD Is garbage. Juvenile should go hang him self after putting out this album. He was alright when he first came out but now he sucks the big one. If I was you dont listen to the retards who tell you ""this is a good comeback album"" . Instead of wasting you cah on this crap i recommend Welcome Back by Mase. That is a good comeback album. The only thing that makes the album even worth noting is the beats of Mannie Fresh. Juvenile just was a waste of those excellent beats. A shame they couldn't go to Ja rule, whose CD sucked with his beats. He has the vocal and writing talent but his beats blow."
3,Could have been better,"I've read the original South Carolina Volumes of the WPA Slave Narratives that this book was edited from. This book could have been a whole lot better. While the current editor did a good job of making the SC African-American dialect more accessible to lay readers (even she admits to having trouble with printed versions of this dialect), many of the better stories were either highly edited or left out, such as Elijah Green's Reconstruction Narrative that was heavily edited and Isreal Nesbitt's recollections of the Vesey Rebellion, which aren't included.However, to the layman and non-historian, this is a good start in understanding slavery from the sources. Some interesting stories do remain, such as the Union County narrative about the Ku Klux Klan. So it's good for starters. The Tennessee and Georgia anthologies in this series are better, though."
4,The real story,"I needed to know the real story about slavery. I wanted the slaves view. This little book helped. I used this book and others to help research for my novel,Chase The Wild Pigeons: A novel of the Civil War."
1,Very Poor Quality,"I had to send these back; they are so bad, maybe they are bootleg copies? Skipped, froze, wouldn't load 4 out of 5 tries, sound so low it couldn't be turned up. Return was easy. Unusual for an Amazon purchase, I generally have perfect transactions."
5,Nicely built unit,very nice unit to work with and built very well. ease of use.I choose the five star because of safety of the unit and the adjustments.Their isn't anything i dislike on this unit.
5,Best product of this type for men,I have slight incontinence from prostate surgery and have used these for over a year. I only need one per day unless I am very active. They are easy to wear under almost any pants or shorts. I prefer this shape and size and the adhesive is much better than other similar products so they stay in place. I have never had a problem with them and feel confident with the level of protection.
2,These guards have gone down in quality!,"I have been using Depend for Men for many years. Over the course of the last year, the pads have become greatly thinner thus does not hold the liquid and causes leakage. Also, they are not ""cuplike"" any longer as they are more flat and less wide from side to side.I am extremely displeased with the way you have taken this product and made it horrible. It never was a great product, but it worked.The package used to state they were for moderate, which they were, and now you made them worse and now the package states maximum absorbency.How untrue!!Nice try on making the package 48 instead of 52 also. That didn't take.We need an affordable quality product. How hard can it be?"
1,Subscription of this item discontinued,We were happy that we were able to get these sent on a regular basis and we received some savings by using the subscription option Amazon offers. We were notified that they were no longer available but have seen them subsequently available on an individual basis without the savings.So we no longer buy them from Amazon.
1,NOT WHAT THEY USED TO BE,These were nowhere the absorbency of the ones I had been using.........quality has gone down the tubes and I will not buy again
2,Lots of pointless diagrams!,"Dr. Bierle's book is a curious collection of anecdotes and diagrams with little actual content. While the book notes that he holds an M.A. and Ph.D in the life sciences, he also has a M.A. in New Testament Studies, which leads the reader to assume that all his conclusions are due to his scientific expertise. However, many of his arguments are weak, although they are accompanied by bizarre, incoherent diagrams. The copy of the book I have is a special edition printing by the Billy Graham Association, which lends the book some credit, but for the most part I found very little in the way of conclusive evidence to present to unbelievers."
1,A great source for any theist who wants to lose an argument.,"This book is near the bottom of the heap, where apologetics is concerned - weaker even than Josh McDowell. Rather than go into the myriad flaws in this book, I will simply recommend Dan Barker's fairly simplistic overview of the theist/atheist debate, ""Losing Faith in Faith""."
1,POORLY DONE,"""Surprised By Faith"" is weak and superficial. With all its faults and failings ""The Case For Christ"" by Lee Strobel is a much better book."
1,Not Season 6,"I wanted a specific episode of season 6, but when this DVD arrived, I can't even tell what season the 4 episodes are from. The V.6 does NOT refer to season 6!"
5,Ms. Horning Has Empathy With Her Characters,"As I read this book the thought kept coming back tome that this author, in a way, must have known thesepeople. The characters and circumstances must havebeen composites of kids and events she had dealtwith herself or knew about from her years ofteaching school. Sometimes those who don't want tobe in class begin to look for other activities thatoften leads them into serious trouble. The authorhandles this very well."
5,Well worth it!,"I purchased this bag for my daughter this past August, she's a senior in high school. She's an A.P. student (lots of very heavy books). This bag is well constructed and holds all of her items without stretching out or tearing. We are both avid anime/manga fans and buy lots of different related products. This one holds up. It arrived quite fast, as described and packaged carefully. I will buy from this vendor again. Thanks"
5,Awesome Product!,"Yes, a little price""y"" however worth every penny well constucted, unique design and lots of pockets. The colors were a major selling point for me and yes they have cheaper anime messengers, but none looked as interesting and as well made as this one."
3,Goin' Backwards,"Goin' Places was released less than a year after The Jacksons' self-titled album and despite the reteaming with Gamble & Huff, the album is a step back for the band. The album is not bad per se, but after leaving Motown for more creative control, the band still found themselves under the thumb of a powerful production team. The experiment of recording a famous Motown act in the Philly Soul sound was an astounding success on their first album together, but Goin' Places sounds like a recycled version of that album. There are some quality songs like ""The Music's Takin' Over"", ""Man Of War"" and ""Heaven Knows I Love You Girl"" but the balance of the album sounds like outtakes. Goin' Places was a major flop on the charts, producing no hit singles and not even denting the Top 40. Despite the criticism, the album is worth a listen if you like The Jacksons and the work of Gamble & Huff."
2,very Average For The Jacksons&Gamble&Huff standards,"the Jacksons didn't keep the flame going from their first album.this one has a couple of Good Songs Like Man Of War,Find Me a Girl&Different Kind Of Lady.but the Song-writting is hurting here.The Vocals are tight and the Philly Groove is there but this Album is Lacking a strong Overall concept."
5,Great music,The JACKSONS have always made great music. I can asure you that we will love at least 5 tracks on the album.
3,Gamble&Huff =good stuff!,"After the 1960's, the role of the music producer became more important, not only to the sales of the record, but to the creation and musical direction as well.Now it's 1977, and we have the Jackson Five minus a Jermaine turning out less than steller demos of their already tired motown style. For a transformation in their sound, the Jacksons turned to veteran producers Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff.Gamble&Huff;'s combination of funky soul and passionate ballads became known as the ""Philly Sound,"" and the Jacksons rode their wave of popularity. Most of these songs are upbeat, horn-section powered, harmony driven pop tunes, something any Jackson fan would love. The casual listener could probably pass it up, because their follow up-record Destiny is superior in style and substance. By the way, Michael met future McEnroe punchingbag Tatum O'Neal during the recording of this record, and dated her for a while."
4,"Good, if you're into the Jacksons.","Blake's picks are Even though you're gone, Man of War and the hit Find me a girl."
4,Excellent book,"Dramatic, well documented and for someone living in France, chilling that the allies could be so harmful to one another."
4,The Doughboys--A good review in the traditional approach to war books,"The story is easily read and covers important issues such as the economic position of the U.S. prior to the U.S.'s entry into the war in 1917. Good coverage of the status of the U.S. troops, their training, equipment, and logistics challenges is provided and are valuable to understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the U.S. military in WW1. I especially enjoyed the discussions of lack of cooperation between the Allied forces and the condition and morale of British and French troops upon arrival of the U.S. troops. This is an important subject that should be studied by everyone who wants to understand 20th century history. This book does a good job of describing WW1 with emphasis on the U.S. military perspective."
3,Falta el canal del subwoofer,"Este SACD no llega a la calidad esperada, llamando la atención la falta del canal del subwoofer.Les recomiendo su disco Andrea, el que sí tiene la calidad y el mix esperado en un SACD."
5,A Thinker's Crime Novel by a Word Smith,"I enjoy The Moon Pool so much that I've re-read it. Too bad that it's out of print. Well known for his Indiana Jones series and his Western subjects, Max McCoy has written a masterful interweave of science, scuba diving, archetypes, mythology, and murder that does not disappoint. I first heard him read an excerpt from The Moon Pool at the Ozark Creative Writers Conference and was hooked by McCoy's elegance. Bringing the setting to life, he draws the the reader into The Moon Pool's dark world inhabited by an even darker villain."
2,Moon Pool and cave diving,"I bought this book without very high expectations, because it was apparently published originally as a mass-market paperback. But I'd been told it had a hi-tech cave-diving theme, and it did turn out to mention several cave-divers I know. (But the scene is really a flooded mine.) It's not a mystery; you find out whodunit on the first page of the first chapter. I guess it's a suspense thriller. I found it readable, but the author's inclusion of lots of unnecessary facts in an effort to show off his research skills did get a bit tiresome. The author is better at technology than character development."
3,cool read,"I liked this book. It was really cool to learn about cave diving and at the same time have a pretty good mystery. I would have liked to have learned more about the victims and the histories of the main character & the villian, but it was still an interesting read."
4,WEIRD and not weird,4 stars because the BIG DIPPER CAN`t scoop up anything. I LIKED ITS POEMS. I LIKE THE ILLUSTRATIONS TOO! COOL!
4,Best of Celtic Music,The only problem I have with this CD is the recorded volume was to low and I had to turn my volume way up to hear it.
5,What I expected,I gave this CD as a gift and she thanks me whenever she sees me as she said it is great.
3,Decent CD of celtic music...,"Purchased this for my wife who enjoys the peaceful mood it puts her in. Not too spectacular, could have downloaded and got the same thing. But I'm not big on purchasing CD's This is probably the first actual CD I've purchased in YEARS!"
5,The Dolphins controller is better than the actualy 360 controller.,"Firstly, it's the freakin Miami Dolphins XBOX 360 controller.Secondly, it's corded, and the cord is about 7-9 feet long, perfect for a dorm room college student who doesn't like to waste his money on batteries.Thirdly, the sticks and triggers are made of a hard, more rugged feeling, plastic than the original 360 controller's. This takes about ten minutes of game time to get used to; however, after wards it has a better feel to it than the original.Fourth, this is a little smaller than the original controller, and it has grips along the side to keep sweaty hands from dropping it in those intense plays that require a firm grip on the ba--controller.Fifthly, the only way it could be better is if Dan Marino would sign mine.""The slightly smaller size also gives you a slight advantage in that you can get to the buttons just a little bit faster,"" so my friends say, but they just have slower fingers than I do."
4,Not the same as the picture,"These are not quite as bright as an incandescent bulb but close enough that I can live with it. Also, Amazon is shipping out the older version of what is pictured. It has three regular LED's instead of the two surface mount ones shown in the picture. This makes it longer by about 1/2"" and not as bright."
3,A Decent Horror,"This movie is filled with several memorable scenes and surreal imagery, and I'd recommend it on that fact alone. As a narrative, however, it doesn't quite deliver. There little or no tension, and aside from a single blood-drenched (literally) scene, there's not much of the sense of dread or danger that I want to get from a horror film. That said, it was still enjoyable, yet I would recommend Mondo Macabro's ""Satanico Pandemonium"" over this one if you are looking to spend your coin on some satanic nun action."
4,"Crazy, Crazy Movie","Wow, this is one insane flick. Beautiful combination of art and sleaze with a potboiler of a plot. The acting is fair and the images were very well shot. The use of virtually no special effects works with the organic feel of the film. Highly recommended to those who love weird and wild 70's cinema. I will not get into details concerning story because that info can be found elsewhere. Check it out."
2,Too much screaming,"this movie started out okay, I was interested in the story line. Then it was all over the place. It was like watching a play with lots over-acting. What was with the bloody nuns wrapped in bandages?? At first I thought they all had leparcyAnd by the end there was so so much screaming, I had to mute my TV.this movie had no cult flair to it, and it most def was not shocking."
1,yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn,"this movie has nothing to do with jodorowskyi rented it based on that recommendationwow, did it bore me to deathnothing interesting happens visually or plotwise unless a handful of naked women makes your daybasically, most of the movie has girls throwing tantrumsthen they superimpose a candle's flame over a girls eye to let you know that she starts all the fires that follow*wow*nothing avant garde or surreal or bizarre or anything about it"
3,Thanks for making me write a review Amazon.com,"This item is exactly what it claims to be, a guide for Pokemon Gold and Silver edition. The best part about it is the details on who will attack you and what they'll attack you with. If you are still playing this game, I say give up as it is basically impossible to complete your Pokedex because Mew has to be given to you via a special code from Nintendo. This game has wasted copius amounts of my time but this guide is good if you want to attempt to beat the Elite Four and the Champion."
4,Honest portrayal of life inside a high security prison.,"After seeing the film, 'American History X', I was hooked on finding out about what it's really like in a prison without the added drama of films. Taki gives an honest, undramatised description of his short time in prison for attempted drug smuggling. He explains the torment of being alone and not being able to walk around freely, 24 hours a day, as well the the disgusting conditions prisoners may put up with. It was certainly different to the the image that films like 'shawshank' gave. It showed the human side of prisoners as well as the goodness that the guards were capable of. It also gave interesting descriptions of the social code that inmates followed. For example the unspoken rule that a prisoner never uses the lavatory when the other prisoner is present, as this is 'home'. A recommended read to anyone interested in prison and the loyalty inmates share."
4,Great BooK,"A great book, maybe a little slow at the end. If you like Taki, I highly reccomend this collection of his writings."
2,Too much gore,"After reading everything Morgan Llywelyn has written, this was my last stop. I was very disappointed with this book, I could tell the horror parts written with Michael Scott's influence. Cannibalism, incest, monsters, people turning into jelly, after a while the shock loses its influence, and the reader becomes inured to the violence. I agree with those who say that Morgan Llywelyn should do her own thing from now on. That, and the fact that there will be no book 3, probably means this book is not worth the time to read it."
1,Not what I expected,"I only ordered this book because I had the sequel to it give to me as a gift for years. Come to find out the villains of the piece are a brother and sister who have sex together in order to bring evil into the world. I stopped reading and threw it away. Filth in my estimation. If you want a great fantasy book, read the ""Lord of the Rings."""
2,"ehhh, if there isn't anything else to read...","This is definitley not Llywelyn's best stuff. It is a passable fantasy/scifi read, but it seems written in fairly cliche form, and thus may seem suited for younger readers. However, the bits with the incest would have to be blacked out.In conclusion: Silverhand is a fairly easy read, and, while it does have some twists on the basic storyline, once the twists are past the plot becomes fairly easy to guess, with the only random element being which of the secondary characters will die next, and in what manner. If you don't have anything better to read, go ahead, but you'd be much better off with another Llywelyn title."
2,Slick glossy pictures but lacking in content,"Albeit this is not an expensive book, but I suggest you look elsewhere for a more comprehensive treatment of the subject. If you know absolutely nothing about abdominal exercise it might suffice, but why not get the complete picture? I own ""Stronger Abs and Back"" and it is a good choice. I just ordered ""The Complete Book of Abs"" and am awaiting its arrival."
3,Not Too Much Expectations,"I was picturing the book to be sized around those normal novels that you get on the shelf, but this is with big bolded words, some words of encouragement, and loads of pictures (foreground and background included). If you need lots of instructions, turn away from this one."
5,apocalypse now,"WoW! great great stuff... watch out world here comes stuart... Somehow stuart davis has delved within and underneath and beyond the banality and deadness of everyday life and has found a spark of authenticity that is growing into a bon-fire to help breathe life into and transform karma of corpses everywhere (while at the same time opening us to the Blessings of the wondrous depths of the capital Mystery...) With this album and in his life he(and fellow musicians,friends, and wife) is furthering the surrection of ""Sexy Messiah""."
1,Description is Deceiving,"Probably a good device. However, in the product description here on the Amazon site, it states that you can use this product for different areas of the body. But once I got the product, the directions say to only use it on your legs. Attempted to use it on my face just to see and the blades almost cut my chin and lip! So be careful if you think this product is to be used on other parts of the body other than legs!"
4,"Totally handy, gets the job done.","Very handy for traveling around the world without having to worry or bother with using different adapters. With this, all you need are two AA batteries, which is easy to find anywhere. Plus, instead of being confined in one corner near a power outlet, you can use this anywhere.My only complaint is that it doesn't seem as powerful as a plug-in epilator, but it still gets the job done well.A must-have for me when I travel, especially if you don't have time to get your legs waxed and if you're like me, prefer not to shave my legs. Great product!"
2,not worth the money,"There is no qigong secret here to build strength. In fact, this DVD has very little to do with qigong. It is mostly calisthenics. You'd have to be extremely strong to keep up with this guy, in which case, you'd already know how to do pushups.I did like the warriors nine breaths, but that doesn't make this video worth the $45."
5,QST will kick your butt in a good way!!,I have been doing the QST DVD for about 2 months now and I feel a huge difference in the overall tone and strength in my body.Get ready to sweat! This video takes you through both traditional exercises and Qigong techniques and deep breathing that leave you feeling energized and relaxed. No cortisol in the blood stream from this this workout!
5,strength,hardest ive ever done very well done worked my whole body intense felt energized when i was finished highly recommend
5,"Finally, learning nunchaku without banging my own head","For the last 60 years, I have always practiced various forms of martial arts and had on occasion used them to defend myself and my little ones from nasty very big ones. I dreaded learning the nunchaku after seeing how some learners managed to give themselves unwelcome bumps on their heads. This book started me well, and gave me more confidence in doing the exercises. I just hope I never have to use it for hurting others, and just continue using it for exercising and confidence-building."
1,used????,I believed the product was new and and when I received it looked as if it had been a badly taped up return. I did not even open it I immediately returned it at my cost
4,Happy Trails Indeed,"Great product. Very light and easy to handle. I use it for two of my cats. The only downside being the instructions for assembly, and also the fact that the back wheels wobble a little more than I would like, and although we have checked them, they are positioned correctly and still wobble."
4,MorkieMom,This stroller is adorable & my morkie looks so cute inside. It wasn't hard to put together at all either. I haven't used it too much & I found a small rip along the seam in front. That is my only disappointment with it. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
2,Dog Stroller,The front wheels of the stroller wabble if there isn't enough weight up front. It gets frustrating because I love to take my two Yorkies with me when I walk. I need a heavier weight stroller.
5,Great help,Our poor 9 year old Shih Tsu dislocated her hip. We found out that both hip sockets are not formed correctly. Maddie (our pet) loves to walk with us so we immediately ordered this stroller. She loves sitting in it as my husband and I walk her. When we get to a field she does get out to smell and 'run' for a short while. Then she loves to return to her stroller. It is easy to push and was easy to assemble. We have been using it daily for a month and have had no problems. We did put a blanket down for her to lie on to make it a bit softer.
1,happy trails stroller too closed in,scares my dachshund - can't see out unless he stands - would have been so much better if the screened part did not have the material placed across the front which obstructs pet's view.
4,Good but not Great.,"One of the other reveiwers was correct. If you have a small cat, it can easily escape through the gaps on this stroller. I fortunately have a large male maine coon so he cannot squeeze through the gaps. All in all its a quality product. I ordered the purple...and it is more like ""lilac""....I am sure my cat and I will enjoy it very much. I especially love all the many ""mesh windows"" for viewing of your pets while strolling.Its funny that I am a single 45 year old woman...with no husband or kids...I cant wait for my neighbors to see me with a stroller and wonder why they never knew I was pregnant! LOL Wait till they see its a cat in my stroller! LOL"
5,Best thing I ever bought for my cat !!,"I have an indoor only, 15 year old cat and a couple of months ago I bought her this stroller. She loves to stroll ! We go out every day. This stroller is built very well. It is comfortable for her inside, plenty of room to move around. Easily room for 2 cats. It is all screened in so she cannot get out, not that she has even tried. She loves her stroller! There is a big screened window in front and in the back and a smaller one on top so plenty of viewing and your pet can see you. There are good brakes, storage underneath and a key etc holder by the handles. I love the pink. We get so much attention when we are out strolling. People think it is a baby I'm pushing and when they see it is a cat, they are so surprised and have a big smile on their face. Any cat or dog that gets one of these strollers is very lucky. I am SO happy I bought this!"
2,"Great idea, but not quite there yet","I'm concerned about the plastic black mesh window, looks to be coated with some chemical finish. It had a pungent toxic chemical smell to it when first arrived, and even with persistent airing out over several months, smell still persists.I love the idea of a stroller that is more than a cage on a dolly. But I'm concerned enough about the health safety, and, my dog dislikes riding in it, perhaps for the same reason. It didn't work for us."
1,Disappointed,"After many years of my 2 doxies riding in their blue Happy Trails stroller, the wheels became worn. I ordered a new Happy Trails stroller in blue, which I immediately returned. Evidently the Happy Trails stroller has been redesigned and made smaller with smaller wheels. Why? Not only that, but the only other 4 wheeled stroller with the larger wheels (Jeep Wrangler) was discontinued. There is now no 4 wheeled stroller for pets with wheels larger than 6.5"". As stroller people know, the larger the wheel, the easier to push and 4 wheels are much easier than the 3 wheels to control, not to mention more compact. I am very disappointed in Pet Gear for not producing a replacement for either the Jeep Wrangler nor the larger Happy Trail model.....The Pink Plus is also not as big. With all the good reviews for these strollers, I can't imagine why the downsize. I now have to buy new wheels for old stroller...Pet Gear would have made more money by me buying whole stroller."
5,MUCH BETTER ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS,"Just received the pet stroller. The assembly instructed have been UPDATED, were complete and very easy to follow. Just took a few minutes to assemble; everything seems to work, but we have not used it yet, as we do not wish to force the issue with our kitty, just want her to get used to it before she is zippered in."
5,For my therapy dog,"My Yorkie is a therapy dog and we visit hospitals, nursing homes, and children's activities. I could not get along without this stroller. It allows Webster to rest, when needed, and is certainly easier on me since he is not constantly being carried. The compartment can be zipped to provide safety for him as well as quiet time when needed. I use it when going shopping and it affords me a space for packages and a soda tray. Again, Webster is safe inside and curious hands cannot disturb him when I don't want him bothered. This is my second stroller for him, it is used daily. This particular model makes very short, quick turns which makes it so easy to get through crowds and around corners. My Webster and I love this!!"
4,Serves its purpose,"The stroller is great for my two dogs which are about 11 pounds each. The only thing it is missing is a bar across the front of the stroller. When I use it with the front zipper down, the atroller has nothing to keep the dogs inside the stroller. My dogs easily jumps out of the stroller when I don't want them to. A bar across the front would have made this stroller a perfect five star."
5,Awesome pet stroller - Amazon hits another home run!,"Ordered this for my (currently 2lb.) Havanese puppy I affectionately call Sophie Tsu Nami. Although my husband thinks it is quite ridiculous and too girly man for him to be seen near, I LOVE it! Super quality, lightning fast delivery (Amazon Prime), easy for me to assemble, adorable, easy to maneuver, just plain great quality and very well designed with special spots for everything. My puppy cannot go on grass or sidewalk for another 6 to 8 weeks and has been home bound since we got her 4 weeks ago. She needs to be socialized and this is just the ticket. Besides all this, I have severe arthritis and a spinal fusion on it's last leg (no, wait, that!s me! :) ) My point is, it is great to have something to hold onto while getting puppy and me out and about (beats a cane by a long shot!) This is the only review I have ever posted -- it's that good."
3,wanted to love it,I really wanted to love this stroller. I have a 20 lb westie. She is now 12 y/o with two bad knees. She walks very slowly and I need to exercise.......solution a pet stroller. This one looked great.....and when I got it I loved it...light wight sturdy...easy to asemble. BIG problem ...the Rt front wheel shimmied. Back it went and got a 3 wheel version. Much better but stroller weight went up 3 lbs.
3,Stroller is great but nothing inside to attach leash/harness to,I love the stroller...the only complaint I have is that there is no attachment within the stroller to secure the dog by leash or harness. I have sort of rigged up something that works...but it really should have been manufactured with this in mind...the only other safe option would be to have the stroller closed at all times while the dog is in it (webbed netting zippered shut).
5,love it,quality construction. attention to detail and really roomy for my yorkie. she loves it. we put our teacup yorkie in the basket on the bottom. a really good deal.
5,Best I could find,"I did a lot of research before buying this pet stroller. I searched on a lot of websites and read lots of reviews on the different strollers available. The stroller is absolutely well made, very sturdy (my husband commented on this while putting it together). The tires are air filled and give my little Cavalier King Charles Spaniel a smooth ride. It has very good control and make turns easily while you are walking. If you are running, you need to lock the tire so it will be easier to steer. If you are a runner/walker or just want a really fabulous stroller, look no further. Buy this one."
5,Westie's Got Wheels!,"Not only is my Westie stubborn (as he should be), but also slow. Really slow. Now I can take him for long ""walks"" to see the sights and it's good for me, too. Super-easy to put together, high-quality, and also easy to maneuver. The wheels don't get stuck and it contains his 25-pound body comfortably. It's nice to have the bin at the bottom to hold things. And the handrail is high enough so that I don't have to crouch down. You'll want to put a cushion inside. Most important, the Westie really loves it!"
1,Dangerous for more than one reason,"Please look for a stroller that isn't going to tip over with your pet in it and also one that has reflective material on it. Your pet could easily roll into a street inadvertently at night. It has happened to me, and I am glad my stroller had reflective strips on it.Kyjen Outward Hound Walk 'n Roll Pet Stroller, Navy Blue"
4,looking back,I could remember hearing programs on the radio before we even had a television; and television was only in black and white; so looking back at old shows reminded me of the life I enjoyed more as a youth and the quality of television programs. Now days things have become more commercialized; and the programs not all decent and family orientated. But you can look with me and enjoy a multitude of great western shows.
3,Preposterous. Honestly.,"I bought this book as a gift for my parents, who are elderly and who enjoy watching birds and looking at pictures of birds.But when I later went to visit them I got an unpleasant surprise: this book is HUGE. Ridiculously huge.It's the biggest book I've ever seen. It's about the size of a computer tower laid on its side. Bigger than any unabridged dictionary.As a result my parents never use it: it's simply too heavy for them to lift. I'm not joking around here. They're afraid of getting a hernia or hurting their back if they lift it.So it just sits on the shelf gathering dust.Actually, not on the shelf, since this book won't fit on any normal bookshelf. So they just stand it on the floor.If you buy this, make sure the person you're getting it for is in excellent shape.You've been warned."
4,Both culture and recipes,"First of all, this book is not just a simple cookbook. It is a glimpse into an entire way of life, complete with the authors own photographs of places they have eaten.As a result, the Table of Contents is only one layer, meaning that it links to the chapters, but not to the recipes themselves. However, if you want a glimpse of the stories behind pub food, and some interesting selections of food to sample, you might want to pick up this book.What intrigued me was ""Scotch Eggs,"" hard boiled eggs wrapped in a seasoned sausage mix then deep fried. I had recently discovered this recipe and especially appreciated the serving tips at the end. I am looking forward to serving these at a potluck, now that I know they can also be served cold with mustard on the side.This isn't a cookbook for everyone, but it will add a selection of interesting food combinations to your menu, even if you only find one or two you actually want to cook."
4,Hilarious.,"I found this book hilarious.I, personally, won't be cooking anything from here but it was fun to go through and read the titles of the food."
3,Just OK.,Product smells great but doesn't lather up like I would expect it would. It takes too much to feel like I am getting clean.
3,Name Only,"With the premium price you are paying for 8oz of this stuff, you are essentially paying for the name. This body wash is essentially no different from the many other competing products out there. It does have a pleasant smell, but it takes quite a bit to gather a good lather, so your 8oz will not last all that long. I like the Billy Jealousy Hydroplane Shave Cream and their after shave balms, but this particular product falls short."
2,What?!,"It was a good lesson to buy it. Never again. The fragrance smells like when you walk in a barber shop. The consistency is very liquid and seems like diluted with water so you will run out of this thing very very quickly. There are products out there that are way cheaper, smell much better and last way longer than this product. Be wise!"
1,If only I could get it to work,"Great looking, could not get the watch to work. Returned for replacement and had the same problem. All I wanted was a simple push in the stem and voila, it's activated. If that is what you're looking for DON'T buy this watch."
5,Freud Half Round Router Bits,"I have a large selection of Freud Router Bits. So, when I purchased my Incra LS25 Positioner my natural choice for Dovetail, Straight, and Bullnose router bits was Freud. After all who wants to mix in some plain metal colored router bits with all those pretty red ones. My only complaint is that Freud does NOT make a 5/16"" radius Bullnose bit which is one of the sizes needed for the Incra Hingecrafter Jig so after calling Freud and pleading for a 5/16"" bullnose bit I ended up getting the plain metal colored Whiteside bullnose bit which sticks out like a sore thumb in my router bit case. Haven't had the chance to use the Whiteside bit yet but from what I've heard they make a quality bit just like Freud."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Kharl is a master barrel maker. This is good for those that like beer, etc. However he intervenes more than once in the games of rape and violence of some of the local lordlings.They aim to get rid of him, but frame his girlfriend for murder and have her executed. He goes off aimlessly wandering with the staff of the murdered girl and develops into another order master."
1,Kindle version lacking...,"The book itself is fine. I would give the book a good review. But, the Kindle version of the book stinks. The type font is filled with mistakes, extra marks on the page and broken text. Add to it that the fond is alternatively normal in font type then suddenly you have a word or two that are displayed in BOLD font.Finally, when I turn my Kindle off with this book, then start the Kindle again, the book starts from the beginning again. NOT a good sign.So, the only reason this review is so poor is NOT the author's fault. It is the specific version for the Kindle. If the font type was consistent and easier to read the review would be much more positive."
5,Exactly what i was looking for.,Best price and fast shipping. Now if i can only find the valet button on my truck to program it.......
1,Not exactly about Seattle...,"I found the title of this book highly misleading. It tells very little that is specific to Seattle. Could easily be repackaged as ""Homebuying in XYZ city"" with minor changes. I will be returning this book -- talk about false advertising!"
4,Great info to help you navigate the home buying process,"I didn't know half of the things involved in buying a house when I started the process not too long ago. This book presents all the major (and minor) events and issues in a clear, understandable way which helped me become knowledgeable quite quickly. I think it helped me most in understanding the process and then giving me the ability to ask the right questions and look for the right answers to these questions. Of the three different books I read (The Unofficial Guide to Buying a Home; and the second I can't remember) this was definitely the most useful.This book is not a manual or recipe for the ultimate home purchasing experience. Many of the author's suggestions I followed, while some others I didn't. Regardless, though, all of it was very informative and helped me to make the decisions which have led to a very pleasant, happy home buying experience."
5,Seattle Homes: Real Estate around the Sound,"I could not have asked for a better book than this. It is very informative and while technical, it keeps me awake with it ever-present humor. If anyone wants to know about this area and how homes are bought and sold here, this is it. It is also a ""must read"" for anyone expecting to find an agent worth trusting; it will help understand what to look for in an agent, what to do when you find a home you like and how to go about buying it.Miss it at your peril."
5,Great regional info,"I'm writing this because of the review that says it's not about Seattle. I read this book cover to cover, twice, before buying my first home.Absolutely it's about Seattle. Contains tons of information about what is unique about buying a home in Washington state and the Puget Sound region. Unique laws, quirky regional behaviors of local real estate agents, all of this is covered by Mr. Stacey.A lot of the information isn't regional, there isn't THAT much unique to Seattle's real estate market. But the information that is regional is priceless and it's obvious the author knows it well."
5,Indispensible for learning Calculus,"Dear Dr. Pine- Thank you for your timely response. I am most pleased to have found you, and even more pleased to find you have your publication available. I am a 51 year old avid mineral collector, and a member of a local club loosely associated with the U. of Utah. Another member was working on his masters degree in geology, and he one day intimated to me that had it not been for a paperback entitled ""How To Enjoy Calculus"", by Eli Pine, he would never have been able to pursue an advanced degreee. He now has that degree. I have a BS in Industrial Technology with a major in aeronautics and was never required to take math higher than trig. My interest in securing a copy is to benefit my 16 year old son who will be taking Calculus next year in school. I have however taken an interest myself in mastering an understanding. Thank you for your concern for others progression.Mark Rushton"
1,"Sugarplum, what are you reading?","We're enticed into thinking that we're going to learn something of the pedagogy of ""teaching genius,"" but what we're presented with is a pedagogy which can be summarized in just a few words: ""Sugarplum, do you think it might be done differently?""This is a fine technique, but it doesn't require 200+ pages ... to learn about it.The major lesson of the book is how artists have been manipulated into the concert and recording worlds not by talent, but by connections. The author begins to explore this territory--the teacher as dealmaker--but stops short of revealing any insights.Fully 1/2 of the book is an advertising vehicle for DeLay's students."
2,Just a gushing hagiography,"I was so looking forward to reading the book about the great teacher Dorothy DeLay.Being a professional violinist myself and having read just about every book concerning violins and violinists,I was hoping to get some insights into for example what studies Miss DeLay put her pupils through,did she use the scale system of her former colleague Galamian or the older Carl Flesch. Who are her violinistic ""idols"" Heifetz,Milstein,Oistrakh?Who are her favourites among the younger generation of soloists even from outside her own studio I was treated instead to a gushing hagiography which did credit neither to the subject nor the writer."
5,Wish There Were More Like Ms. Delay ....,"and more books like this one. The author lets us in for an inside look at a very special woman's life, and matches Ms. Delay's ability to communicate with her students with a writer's rare ability to communicate with her readers. Especially interesting to learn about the teaching of the younger, up and coming set of violinists .. and comforting to know that the music will live on, with the help of Dorothy Delay and her students!! Reading this book was, for me, like attending an evening of perfect chamber music: a story told in parts, the voices coming in and out, but always in harmony. A must for any classical music fan!!"
4,Great to find out about Ms.DeLay,This book was definitely written with much TLC and dedication by it's author.The most interesting part of the book was about Dorothy's childhood and how she taught.The other stories not so much-just skip through those in my opinion!Can't imagine a non-music person ever reading this. Very interesting about all things violin related..
3,Papillon DVD,"If you have read papillon books, there is no new info here. If you don't have time to read the DVD is OK. Used one adolescent puppy for demonstration purposes. I would have liked to see more adult dogs representing colors, standards, beauty, personality, sizes, breed uses (working in hospitals, service dogs, agility?) Training section helpful."
4,not great,"Maybe I expected too much from this DVD, but I found it to be just OK, not great.It does contain some useful information and interesting facts, especially for the first time owner on the breed, but it could be so much more entertaining, considering that Papillon such fun high energy dog. It was a bit boring and incomplete."
2,pink is the new red,"The red color shown is not accurate - it is more a peachy-pink. I exchanged it for the black one, which also isn't really black; it has a kind of brownish tone."
4,Fun not sure if he's dirty cop loses the drugs thriller,"It's in French, so bear with the subtitles. The story and acting are all strong. My favorite aspect of this movie is the creative use of the location. Busy nightclub and restaurant and kitchen. They never really leave the building it starts in. I thought it was pretty cool."
4,Can't give this movie more than 4 stars.,"In my opinion this is a 4 star movie. There were a few great moments in the film (the fight scenes) and the ending was pretty good too, but overall, I don't feel at all this movie is worth a 96% and 4.5 ratings.Several times while I was watching the film I quit watching it, but I returned to finish it because I wanted to know why it was rated 4.5/5.0 stars on Amazon and why the critics at RottenTomatoes gave it an average of 96%/100%.Well, Sleepless Night is exactly about that. An entire night the man is chased after and he is also chasing. The ""plot twists"" another reviewer mentioned I had already predicted long before they were revealed, and they were not even that great.All in all, almost the entire movie is about the man being chased in the club and him chasing his son. It is a good film but not great or ""outstanding"" and it certainly does not deserve a 96% or anything higher than 4.0/5.0.Watch at your own risk."
3,"If you want action, look elsewhere","The trailer is a little deceptive. This movie is very slow in places. It's not a super clever film, but goes forward with a certain tired doggedness. The core of the film is supposed to be the relationship between the son--who is kidnapped by gangsters and held captive in a disco--and the father, but I thought it was a bit cliched. How many cop movies have you seen where the cop is divorced, works too much, and fails to connect with his teenage son/daughter? So I was disappointed in the sporadic action and the sentimentality. Worth seeing, but not for $6."
3,It's okay,Its in subtitles so kinda of hard to follow. It's a little long and drawn out to get to the end.
4,Minstrel,"Paul Simon promised that he would never read his liner notes for the 1965 British solo album, THE PAUL SIMON SONGBOOK. It's understandable why-- Simon might have felt they were a too-awkward attempt at a conversation of one. Perhaps he had doubts about their oddly hallucinogenic imagery, as well.Maybe not the greatest of self-promoters, there's no question that Mr. Simon clearly was, by 1965, already a songwriter of the first rank-- the man's talents shine brightly on all of these tracks. That this earliest solo work wasn't released in the USA until decades later is as much a mystery as the true meaning of Paul's liner note chat with the Poppy Tender.What a delight it is to examine the sonic building blocks that two future Simon & Garfunkel albums would draw upon. And what a privilege too, to hear the master minstrel, in voice and guitar alone, telling his stories and baring his soul. Opportunities like this are so very rare.TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 38:40"
5,ever memorable,"I purchased Sinai Tapestry and Jerusalem Poker in the news stand of the St George Hotel subway stop in Brooklyn Heights New York over two decades ago.I loaned them out one too many times, and they were eventually lost. These are two of the most memorable and creative tales I have ever read and I have been attempting to re-acquire the books ever since. I am stunned to see that all of E. Whittemore's books are O. O. P. Whatever happened to such a talented writer? He certainly knows how to spin a tale and imprint it on your psyche. After all the years, I can easily visualize many of the scenes Mr Whittemore put to paper, and can't wait to have copies in hand again."
2,Boring and repetitive,"Jerusalem, the historic and holy city, is always a draw. So when I heard of this series of obscure but supposedly literary novels focused on the city, I decided to give it a try. The first one, Sinai Tapestries, was amusing. I figured the second one, Jerusalem Poker, would get better. It didn't. Boring and repetative. How many times can the author milk the same conceits, phrases and stereotypical characters? Too many times for me."
2,the templars and the grail,the book is too especulative not mush scientific information can be obtained.
3,Dated,This movie was so funny when I first saw it but now it's a little dated. The picture is fuzzy - but it's still funny.
1,What the hell!?!?,"I bought this Webkinz Hippo as a cute, dumb apology gift for my girlfriend, and she still broke up with me! This piece of crap isn't cute enough to get her to forgive me for sleeping with her sister. 1 star."
2,Not Too helpful,"I have just returned from a trip to the eastern Sierras and was looking forward to the information and tips contained on the DVD.The info is old, often referring to film issues, not digital.Some of the locations visited don't show the conditions the Mr. Gale describes. For instance, he talks about getting a reflection in a mirror surface lake while he is standing in front of water that shows no reflection. I get the point, but it would be better, in my opinion, to illustrate your point with what you are speaking about.My copy was defective as it skipped chapter to chapter and I returned it without asking for a new copy. I just didn't find it that helpful.Somone else may find it much more useful and interesting."
5,Perfect insulated screwdriver,"If you are using a screwdriver on or near live circuits this is the screwdriver to use. Rated to 1,000 volts. Tested at factory."
1,Bottle opener - Does not open bottles,"This handsomely antiqued wall-mount bottle opener is a great aesthetic addition to any barn wall or rustic Kitchen. Be warned, however, that the fixture will not actually open a bottle."
2,V. M. Live @ The Fireside Bowl,"This is a taping of a live show occuring less than 2 weeks after ""Live @ the Bottom of the Hill in San Fransisco."" The recording quality on this is terrible. It's supposed to give you a more acurate feel for the ""live experience"" but I just found it distracting. If you're looking for Avail live pick up ""live @ the Kings Head Inn"" or ""Live @ the Bottom of the Hill."""
1,Didn't work,Got it. Put it in. It didn't work. Took it to a certified mechanic and they confirmed that it was a bad part. Mechanic put in a good part and everything worked as it should. Returning it for a refund.
1,Defective out of the box,"Truck at least worked with the old malfunctioning part! Put this on and it did nothing. Dead part. Disappointing, now I have to wait for refund and order elsewhere."
5,My review,[...]This link above is my review of Dustin Mills' movies. While I only mention Puppet Monster Massacre you'll get a good idea about his style in general. Enjoy!
3,good game be the referee calling sucks!,"The graphics are great and the game is fun overall. However, it is a little annoying that the referees call things against you and do not on the other team. For example, when you are throwing in the ball, if you don't get it in in like 4 seconds it is a turnover. OK, fine, as long as it is called the same for the other team but it isn't. They have an unlimited time limit to get the ball in, I have counted almost 10 SLOW seconds before they have thrown in the ball and no whistle.Also, defense is horrible! Unless you change the fouls to low in the game play, almost every contested shot is a foul. It is also very difficult to block their shot, but they can block your shot all day.It is fun to play for a while but it gets frustrating after a bit. I suggest shopping around before making a decision."
4,NBA 2K8,"I bought it mostly for my son. The game's a lot of fun. I haven't figured out, how to do a few things yet. I don't have alot of time for it either. Foul shooting with the PS3 is definitly more difficult. I'm an old head though, this game and its tricks are for kids."
4,It works and does not smell,"Bus love me and this keeps them off for a while. Best of all, I did not smell like bug spray."
2,Beware-contains SPF 30!,"I bought this product from this vendor because the picture of the product did not have an SPF on it. I assumed this was the Avon Expedition Skin So Soft that I purchased last year from Avon with no SPF. Unfortunately, this product has SPF in it. I don't like mixing the two, because I don't feel like you are getting as good of sun protection or insect protection. I wish the product would have clarified that it WAS SPF 30. Oh well. Still using it as I have no other choice but to use the Skin So Soft with SPF. Avon is no longer making one without. :("
3,Draining,"Don't get me wrong...Overall, I highly enjoyed the story. It was very hard to determine what to rate this book. I really wanted to give it a 4.5, but will settle for a 3. If Ms. Henley had shortened the story, and omitted all the tacky verbiage, I would have given it a higher rating. The romance was tediously drawn out, and felt like a love hate relationship. I'm drained from this reading this book, but would keep it on the shelf for anther shot at it. Maybe the second time will be better."
1,Crummy stuff,"Why not just call this book ""Pagan Porn"" and be done with it.I am no prude, but honestly I read romances to read about romance. Not just sex. Yes that's great too, but give me some plot, ok? Make the hero/heroine remotely likable.And I know it is important to hook a reader in with the first few pages of a book, but to start a novel off describing someone's penis (""It was the most beautiful ( ) she had ever seen..."")is really trashy. Honest! I didn't make it up--go see for yourself. I read that line in the bookstore and vowed if I read this book it would be from the library. So I borrowed it and was duly disappointed. But you don't have to be--read some other novel by henley--A Year and A Day and A Woman of Passion are both quite good."
4,Great Book,"I have just recently ""found"" Virginia Henley, and so far with the exception of just one book (The Raven and the Rose) I have loved them all. Set during the reign of Charles II Raurk and Cat's love story is a page turner. A wonderful love story with a surprise twist at the end. From the Court of Charles II to the wild wind swept Cornish coast to the wild and sexy pirate Rory this is a great love story. The characters are human and make mistakes but in the end what brings the characters together in the first place, ties them together in the end. Rich with historic accounts of the Great London Fire, the Plauge, and the Dutch war and actual historic figures you will not be let down."
5,One of my All-time Favorites!!!!!,I think this is one of the best books I've ever read so far. The romance between Ruark and Summer is so touching and wonderful. I love how they get into little fights. Ruark and Summer are so possessive of each other and I love how Summer lets him cool his heels while she's off having fun. They both have so many adventures and they're so perfect for each other. This is my favorite book and the best of Henley's writings. You can't put it down and you read over your favorite parts almost every day.
4,This is the most erotic book I have ever read!,"My favorite part is when the pagan is on the pirate's ship andhe leaves her with nothing on but the fragipani and jewels. The oralsex is so exciting I feel orgasmic, too. Virginia Henley is my favorite author."
4,Interesting Volumn,"For the Hawken lover and only the Hawken lover, this is an interesting and provocative text. I do not personally agree with all of the author's assumptions, but his presentation and writing style are excellent."
4,Good Blues CD,"I've liked Artie ever since he did ""Leanin' Tree"" back in the 1970s. I kinda lost touch but I bought this album and it's all good. ""I Love To See You Smile"" always gets my toes tapping."
4,Another charming romance from the 70's.,"Another charming romance from the 70's. Our hero is domineering and our heroine is feisty. There's an evil woman who wants the hero and spreads lies about the heroine. Add a precocious child who tries to hide how desperately she needs the hero's approval, and we have the ingredients for a most enjoyable read!The Autocrat of Melhurst by Anne Hampson~ Harlequin Romance #1442 ~ November 1970From the book cover ....Claire had promised Simon Condliffe that she would stay on in her job as nanny to his small niece as long as he needed her -- but she hadn't bargained on falling in love with him, and then having to watch him with his close friend--or was she his fiancee -- Ursula Corwell."
2,Not Enough,"I took 6 pills a day and still did not notice that much of an effect, my weight is the same, it hasn't curbed my appetite and worst of all...at 6 pills a day this stuff only lasts for 10 days before you have to spend another $50. I have tried everything under the sun for diet control and still haven't found anything. I'm sticking to daily exercise and trying to watch what I eat, plus drinking lots of water-- but it would really be nice to find something to help cut the cravings and the desire to overeat."
1,Used This product for 30 days,"I used this product for 30 days as recommended on the package. I did not notice any appetite suppression from the product. Additionally, I did drink copious amounts of water (because I heard that this would contribute to the success of the product). I have purchased Hoodaba TM, I will start taking it this month to compare the two products."
1,TERRIBLE,"This stuff really doesn't do anything for me. I am still hungry all the time. I would not suggest that anyone buy this product. Maybe it does work for others, but for me it was a complete flop and not worth the money I spent on it."
1,Totally useless product,Don't waste your money. I wouldn't even give this one star except there is no option for 0 stars.
1,Does not work! Zero stars.,"I ate just as much as usual when I took these capsules.People... listen to me. This DOES NOT WORK. Hoodia may work, but do not waste your money on this particular product."
1,Desert BURN Not So Great For Me,"I saw the BBC television program about the San People and their use of Hoodia to reduce hunger pains. So I got all excited and decided to try Hoodia. The first 4 bottles I tried were not DESERT BURN Hoodia. They were products I purchased locally at drug stores like Rite Aid and GNC and Vitamin World.[...]None of those 4 bottles I tried earlier even made the list. However, Desert Burn was on the list so I decided to try it by buying it from Amazon.com. I've been taking 3 pills a day with little or no results. I eat breakfast and dinner (at night) only and still go to bed hungry at night. I was really hoping that one of the herbal companies would get it right so that we as customers would not be controlled again by the pharmaceutical giants selling us yet another super inflated product that we become hooked on. Sadly, for me I am not satisfied with Desert Burn and will not be buying it in the future."
3,Trad + electronic funk = mixed bag,"Smadj is a virtuoso French-Tunisian oud player (one of the DuOud duo) and has created a traditional/electronic fusion with mixed success. For me the tracks that sounded the most traditional are the best, with the oud being the dominant feature. The percussion accompaniment is very good, but some of the electronica, although not too over the top, ultimately became noisy and annoying. Certainly not as subtle as oud-player Dhafer Youssef's recordings. His are arty where these are pop. Still, there's a nice Arabic atmosphere and some may enjoy the funk more than I did."
5,Excellent Condition,This is a great book! I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the pictures and stories and the condition of the book.
4,Wow,There are some fun amazing stories! This book is not for younger readers. It looks like it could be but there are some very adult stories in this book. Beautifully written and the pictures are great!
5,Better than expected,"I wasnt sure how these were made, just by looking at the picture. But to my amazement, they are made very well. They are very durable, and so much nicer than I had expected. Everyone who has seen my bookmark, wants to know where I got it. It is wonderful. I had also purchased a pink one, along with my blue one, for my daughter. And she loves it. I am very pleased with these, and will be ordering more in the future."
4,Grandchildren love it,"I ordered this DVD for my 2 and 4 year old grandson and granddaughter in CA. Their mother said that they love it, especially because it a rather free form format- not a follow the steps direction."
5,fast fingers frank,FRANK MARINO IS UNEQUALLED WHEN IT COMES TO GUITAR PLAYING.I HAVE SEEN THE MAN TWICE IN THE 80'S AND I AM GRATEFUL THAT I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THE GREATEST GUITARIST ALIVE TO DATE-YES THAT INCLUDEDS THE LATE GREAT JAMES MARSHALL HENDRIX. FRANK HAS TAKEN HIS PLAYING TO A LEVEL THAT FEW MUSICIANS WILL EVER OBTAIN-HIS NEWEST LP REAL LIVE ONLY BUILDS ON THIS MANS REPUTATION FOR BEING ONE OF THE GREATEST LIVE ACTS EVER. HE DOES NOT USE A LOT OF GIMMICKS BUT RELIES ON SHEER TALENT AND BOY HOWDY DOES HE HAVE PLENTY.HE LEAVES YOU ASTOUNDED THAT SUCH WONDEROUS SOUNDS CAN BE OBTAINED FROM A MERE SIX STRINGS -NOTES THAT FLY AS HIGH AS ANGELS AND IMPROVISIONS THAT ARE WORKS OF ART. I AM SURE BY NOW THAT YOU KNOW I AM A REAL FAN AND HAVE BEEN SINCE MAXOOM. IF YOU THINK THIS LIVE ALBUM IS GOOD THEN CHECK OUT REAL LIVE AT WWW.MAHOGANY RUSH.COM AND SEE HOW FAR THIS MAN HAS COME SINCE THEN -TRULY AWE INSPIRING STUFF. LISTEN FOR THE FIRE CRACKERS IN THE ANSWER AND THEN WATCH THIS MAN EXPLODE.
4,"Wow, what a discovery","I've read about Frank Marino & Mahogany Rush several times over the years, but somehow I'd never managed to hear anything by the group. Then a few weeks ago I found this old LP for $2.99 at a local record store and thought, ""Who knows? I might like it."" Though to be fair, I didn't really think I would. Most of my music collection is 80's metal and rock, so I didn't think I'd be into this.Man was I wrong. Makes me wonder why Frank Marino isn't a more celebrated guitarist (his name occasionally finds itself in the pages of Guitar World, but not too often). What makes this so interesting is that it's live. My guess is there are no studio touch-ups (like we get with today's pseudo-live albums). Just a great 3-piece rock band bashing it out onstage with the tapes rolling.It's nice to stumble upon something new like this--even if it happens to be 30 years old!!! My $2.99 was well-spent."
5,What in the World is this....??,"I believe it was early 1978 and me and some friends were all big Styx fans, and the night had finally got here for the show. We were a little late getting to the venue, but no big deal...right?..... Styx wouldn't be coming on for another hour or so. Well, after we got inside, we heard this strange, amazing sound being performed inside. Who is this? What is this? Why didn't we know about this band? We heard like the last two or three songs of Mahogany Rush which was the back up band for Styx. Nothing against Styx, but Mahogany Rush completely blew them away, and the next phase of my musical education had begun. I didn't miss many back up bands from that night on! The reincarnation of Jimi Hendrix?..... maybe so!"
5,Canadian Rock-Rush?NOOO Mahogany Rush!,The best of the 70's Canadian bands was not Rush (even though they were great) but Frank Marino and his band. His renditions of Jimi Hendrix's songs as well as their originals made this band one of the best guitar driven acts. Frank Marino and Mahogany Rush Live is one of my favorite live albums of all time!
5,"legendary, classic, what rock was.","Rewind, a little to high, driving a little to fast, Frank Marino Live a little to loud. Fast forward, a little to fat, a little to gray, Frank Marino Live a little to loud. This is still a great album. Buy, buy. buy."
2,not so thin walled....,"i purchased these because the description said ""Thin wall to fit tight mag wheels""Well, they are thin, except the part that protrudes OUT in the middle of the socket. (the area directly next to the labels).Because this section sticks out, it has marred my Volk RE30 wheels. I might have to take my grinder and shave them down. If that part wasn't raised, they would be perfect. Or if the actual socket length was longer, they would be better so the raised part wouldn't come into contact with my wheels.2 stars for now. i will go back and shave them and see if it holds up. If it does, then i may raise to 3 stars!"
1,Stupid size combinations,"Anyone who is looking for a flip socket wants a 19mm x 21mm socket first, foremost, and is the reason flip sockets were invented. This set, and other idiotic 3 socket sets has combinations you'll never want. For the ultimate in stupidity, they have a 22mm x 7/8"" flip socket. What? They are the same size you morons! They are off by microns, and anyone using impact sockets doesn't need that degree of precision. What a bunch of dumbasses."
5,Great,Use it all the time and have no problems with them. Great product at a great price. I recommend it for anyone who needs or wants them.
4,very handy for chnaging wheels,"This is a great setup to carry with me on the road if I need to change a wheel on my truck or trailer. I have a small tool bag just big enough for a Dewalt impact, 2 batteries, and thsi socket set. I just grab it and throw it in whatever I am driving that day."
5,"Nice price, great quality","I wasn't expecting much for such low price, but these sockets have some weight to it and appear solid. Can't wait to use it when I get my impact wrench."
1,Uselss. Don's waste $$,"Full of generalities and assumptions. Gee, thanks for telling redheads they are sensitive to sun! Low on science, high on corny."
1,complete drivel- dont waste your time or money,bought this book for my auburn headed husband. its a silly little waste of time. all piffle- no substance.
4,"cliched, but still good","I picked up this book from the library on a whim. I wasn't expecting a great deal - books about the troubles of Middle School tend to be boring, cliched, and too numerous. I was pleasantly surprised. In some ways this book is just like any one of those; there are plenty of cliches to go around. However, some of the observations here are dead on, and reading this brought back some vivid memories from when I too was an insecure middle schooler who wrote. Overall, I enjoyed it greatly, and I'd recommend it to anyone who had a rough time in that stage of life (which is virtually everyone, I guess...)."
1,Broke after 2 months,"We were excited to get this set for my 20 month old as the decor matched nicely in with our living room. We were quickly disappointed after 3 weeks when one of the chairs begain to wobble and we were unable to tighten the bolt as it wobbled in a location without a bolt. Wood glue helped temporarily, so we removed the chair and were down to 1 chair. At 8 weeks the table leg snapped and splintered while my son was leaning against it. My son is active but was not rough with it. We would not recommend."
2,"Strange Sizes, Mis-Matched Wood","I have been looking for a good table and chairs for my two children for over a year and really loved the idea of having some style... alas what this table & chair set has in style, it lacks in decent proportions. The chairs are TINY, better for toy bears than small children, and the table is really quite tall for such small chairs. The wood is also not as 'woody' as I would have preferred, more 'plastic' looking and the chair colour does not match the table colour at all. If I read this (my own) review, I'd think what a picky old housewife, but honestly I'm not all that picky... just disappointed.Assembly was easy. The items appear to be pretty strong and not wobbly at all."
1,poor quality-huge disappointment,"While setting up the product tonight, one of the screws was set wrong and loose, the glue came apart on the two chairs, and as my husband gently placed a chair down for the first time, a chunk of wood split off the chair. We were stunned at the shoddy manufacturing. Will be returning and wishing we'd read these reviews first."
2,SMALL!,"We have had this table for almost 2 years now. On the pro side, I will say that it is a nice looking table. Unfortunately there are more cons. The screws are constantly loose, and the chairs often feel ""rickety"" because of it. Even when all the screws are tightened the chairs still feel unstable. The table is the same way. The major con for me though is how small this table is. There is enough room for two children at it to eat and that is all. Forget about trying to color at the table with two children. There is not enough room for a box of crayons and two coloring books. When we first got this I actually thought it would be better as a desk with only one chair. If you are looking for a table for use by more than one child, I do not recommend this table at all. We will be purchasing a new table and chairs set this year."
3,Not Bad for the price,"You get what you pay for. Basically, all the parts are pre-made and you have to assemble them with the alan wrench provided and the bolts included. It's all real wood so that's nice, but I strongly suggest that you put it together both with all the hardware and by gluing it up with wood glue.Once that's done they're fine."
5,Another response for watchman-on-the-wall,"Just two questions, watchman-on-the-wall:1. How do you know that ""obviously the author didn't check the biblical account"" when you admit that you FELL ASLEEP halfway during the movie?2. If the ""spirit of God"" did in fact ""open your eyes to the scriptures"" then why weren't you able to ""avoid speculation and old wives' fables likes this movie""? Last temptation of watchman-on-the-wall, perhaps?"
1,Slowly paced and awkward,"It seems that many devout Christians love this portrayal of Jesus as more human than divine, but it simply didn't work for me. Part of the problem lies in the acting, which simply isn't that believable (i.e., Harvy Keitel). An even bigger obstacle is the dialogue given to the characters. Not only does it sound unnatural, but some of it seems to go against the traditional teachings of the Bible. Consider, for example, the scene where Jesus gets a little angry, picks up an axe (yes, an axe!), and declares war. Apparently he decided that whole ""love thy neighbor"" thing just wasn't working anymore. The biggest drawback to the film, though, is its length. Clocking in at over 2 hours 40 minutes, it has dillusions of grandeur. Rather than the greatest story ever told, you'll see lots and lots of sand, as well as miracles presented like parlor tricks."
1,Breathtaking,"This was really beautiful and breathtaking film. Willem Dafoe was intepreting Christ best he could. My husband and me were talking a lot about our feelings that we felt after we saw the movie. It was so unpleasant to see that a little girl, ""good angel"", who took down Jesus from cross, was fake. After that everything went wrong. Oh God, is it a dream? Somebody tell him that he is the One! Oh, it was all Satan's work. We knew that Jesus will conquer, and he made it.I hope I'll get soon a Nikos Kazantzakis's book ""The last temptation of Christ"" in english cause there in no translation in croatian."
1,I really tried to keep an open mind.,"I understand what the director was tring to do, I am also glad that Willem Defoe considerd this the most inspiring movie he has ever acted in. That is why it got the 1 star. But ..... First the idea could have been handled better about the ""what if he didn't die on the cross"". Also the events in Jesus's life were all out of order, If you are going to tell the story of this man please atleast be accurate of when the events took place. Also he was treated as a tormented soul that needed more advice from his followers then what he knew about himself. Sorry the son of GOD had many years to figure it out before his ministry and his disciples were barely figuring out what he was all about let alone giving him any advice. A divine soul would have graduated past alot of these problems, even the enlightened Budda is treated better then that. The sound track is the best part of the movie. P.S. You are better off buying ""Jesus of Nazarath""."
4,Impressing,"""The Last Temptation Of Christ"" is very faithful to Nikos Kazantzakis' novel. It's the kind of movie that will make you want to analyze it. Very impressing."
5,Excellent Film,"I was very interested in watching this film to find what out all the controversy behind it, and my reaction was that there was not anything offensive about it. Born into the Catholic faith I really found this movie rather moving and simply beautiful. Defoe was superb in his role of Jesus displaying all that insecurity but at the same time showing all the love and compassion that really captivates the human spirit. Kietel in my opinion did a good job in his role as Judas, Jesus`loyal desciple(at least in the film). The soundtrack by Gabriel is simply breathtaking along with the backgrounds of biblical cities and landscapes. A true classic in its own right."
1,Can You Believe THIS????,"I see. This is how ""Diverse"" and ""Pluralistic"" our society is become. If you mock Christ (as they do in this film) then you are good and moral and ""tolerant"". If express your opinion to the contrary then you are labled by these nice ""tolerant"" and ""enlightened"" people as a bigot and narrowminded. Oh yeah...thats fair and ""tolerant"". The Christ haters are only ""tolerant"" with those who agree with thier own agenda. Thus they are exposed as hypocrites and decievers. They denounce ""hate"" and ""hate speech"" but speak and write hate against anyone who is a Christian. I call that mental illness."
5,Great Movie!,"I am A Conservative Republican, and I Enjoyed this Film! I'd Recommend this movie to anyone(Christians to Non-Christians) That is if you can find this movie. It is a hard movie to find, and it is Expensive too.(I got mine off of E-bay for under $10.00) This movie is worth every penny! The central thesis of the movie is that Jesus, while free from sin, was still subject to every form of temptation that humans face, including fear, doubt, depression, reluctance, and lust. By facing and conquering all of man's weaknesses, Christ became the perfect model for our lives; he sacrificed not only on the cross, but throughout his life. He struggled to do God's will, without ever giving in to the temptations of the flesh."
4,beautifully done,"This is a gorgeous film telling a great story -- Jesus' alternative life had he not chosen sacrifice. No doubt theologians will quibble, but as a film the story is told very effectively.My film quibbles: The film is too long -- or perhaps it is too slow moving in places. You choose. Women in the film are blank slates -- empty stereotypes. But perhaps that was the point. Harvey Keitel as Judas sounds like he is from the Bronx. If he had lost the accent I could have bought into his burly, likeable Judas more.Other than that... a lovely piece of film making. Dafoe is better at Jesus than he is at the Green Goblin."
5,"Hey Mary, me tangere!","A fantastic package, as Criterion usually does. The most interesting information describes in detail First Century rituals/techniques involving crucifixion as performed by Romans. The funniest bit is Willem Defoe explaining that Martin Scorsese insisted the actor smoke in a trailer instead of outdoors, fearful that any photographs of Christ smoking a cigarette would get out into the public and cause hysterical people to become apoplectic. One of the few thoughtful films of the last twenty years with many elements that roll around then stick in your head. Great assembly of veteran character actors and once you get used to how Defoe's mouth moves, it's difficult to imagine a more powerful performance."
2,Boring movie. Good artwork,As a christian I'm not going into details on the mistakes of this movie. Not only is NOT based on the Gospels which are the TRUE accounts of the life of Jesus. But this movie is way wrong on portraying Jesus as how he was really. The movie however has great music but the script and the direction of a director like Scorsese are just plain dull. The only thing that can save the movie is the music from Peter Gabriel and that's about it. Mel Gibson at least was honest portraying Jesus. Scorsese was just mistaken and missguided for Kazakantis book.
1,Blasphemous movie....,"This movie is pure filth and blasphemy against our Lord, Jesus Christ. It's an attempt to bring Jesus Christ down to a level of a sinner and a sinner is what he was not. Would it make any more sense to make a movie about any other historical figure and conjure up a life that never occurred, especially in this case, where scriptures state He was blameless. To read some of the reviews praising this movie and labeling the faithful Christians as ""narrow minded"" is narrowmindedness in it's own right. There's no room to speculate when it comes to spiritual mindset of Jesus Christ. He is God, blameless and died for the sins of all mankind. The movie and book is a work of satan."
1,Please enter a title for your review,"I watched the first 15 minutes, watched the next 30 minutes on fast forward, then turned it off. I couldn't see what relevence one scene had to the next or even what relevence one characters' line had to the other character's line he was responding to. The guy playing Jesus acted the role with the childlike innocence of an 18 year old and the score sounds like it was recorded on some overused analog tape in a really cheap studio, reminiscent of the b-grade horror films of the time. I guess it's the kind of movie you keep screaming at to convey something coherent but if you manage to make it to the end the few pieces that fit together will seem all the more important for the way in which they were presented. Defintely not a film for someone with a short attention span or anyone who has a need to understand what they're watching as if unfolds. Or maybe you just need to have read the bible to be able to follow it."
1,This is BAD,"The acting is bad.The special effects are bad; the ""devil flame"" blows in the wind, the river Jordan is a ravine with a foot of water in it.The concept is bad, it's like saying Winston Churchill was a Russian soldier fighting on the eastern front.There is so much that could be explored and written about in the Scriptures, I don't know why people have to make up fairy tales."
2,Bad transfer,"I completely agree with the reviewer who said that the transfer for this movie is bad. I waited a long time to buy that film, it was always too expensive on DVD (Criterion) so when I saw it on B-Ray for around 25$, I went for it. Bad decision, I was very disapointed to say the least. The picture quality is awful, it seems that all the colors are gray and the picture definition is equal to an ordinary DVD. I have a pretty good sound system (5.1) and the D.T.S was okay but not great, I've seen better. Criterion is usually very good but not this time, I praised them often but once in a while they slip one, this is one of those time. Another example will be The Scarlett empress by Josef Von Sternberg, it's one of the worse transfer of all time. So believe me, avoid The Last temptation of Christ in Criterion cause you will lose your money."
5,Best Religious Movie of all Time,"I remember when this movie came out-it was BANNED in Orlando-where I lived and the studio that produced it was located. I had to drive up to Silver Springs, FL, and break through a picket line (of people who had not seen it and didn't believe anyone else should) to see it. It was great, although long. How can you tell a great story of Jesus in only a couple hours? Through the years, I've sat through many ""Hollywood Style"" religious movies that were full of the same old fables. In my opinion, this takes the cake, hands down-mainly because it's the most believable. I've watched it several times since then and would recommend it to anyone who wants to get a true feeling (as best we can) of what it may have felt like to be human, yet be ""the son of God"". Amen"
2,It misses the point,"The controvercy surrounding this film is actually silly. The novel by Kazanstakis mrerly uses the life of Christ as a starting-point for the exploration of the human psyche in terms of predestination. It is a philosophical work which is here given soap-opera treatment. It was a novel never meant to be filmed and as such the film is a terrible disappointment, despite some great scenes. Barbara Hershey is superb as the Magdalene and her performance alone makes the rest of the mess worth wathcing (for a while). David Bowie's brief appearance is also a gem, but all in all the film falters on its own pretentions. It cannot decide what it wants to be and Scorcese's good intentions merely pave the road to hell even further."
3,"So, so film with good acting.","I felt the film was good, but was rather predictable. The ending with Satan aiding Christ in his pursuit of a ""normal"" life was an easy pick. If Christ were to have died in the end as a ""normal"" man that would have left Satan as a powerful entity, with no Christ to save mankind. Another was the Apostles showing up at Jesus's death bed just in time to convince him to hold His end of the bargain and die on the cross rather than as a ""normal"" man. Willem Dafoe did a respectable job in the film and Harry Dean Stanton was good also. Harvey Keitel was a terrible choice as Judas. Many of the Apostles come off as airheads, especially Peter. My suggestion would be to read the novel by Nikos Kazantzakis. Even though the movie adhears to the book fairly well, the book is superior to the movie as is nearly always the case with Hollywood."
2,"Horrible depiction of Christ, but artistically fascinating","I am a proud believer of the Bible and since I've seen most of this film, I think I have a say in this like everyone else. This film horribly depicts Jesus as a very human Savior instead of the Son of God. People say it's interesting that this film shows him helping out during a crucifixion, but remember this is the Son of God and he would be trying 2 save the person on the cross instead of helping to kill him. The scene where he rips his own heart out is disturbing and the blasphemy is really shown once he has sex with Mary Magdalene, something that Christ would've never done.Now don't get me wrong, I was fascinated with the direction. There's no question that Scorcese is a great director and scenes are shot beautifully in this film.But sadly, the film is overtaken by its horrible account of Jesus' life. 'The Passion' was a more accurate and basically a better and more powerful film."
1,Ignore the controversy--this movie is just painfully boring,"If it weren't for the controversy surrounding the original theatrical release of ""Last Temptation"", I don't think many would've seen it. Those who boycotted gave this movie the kind of press you just can't buy...and much more attention than it deserved. The bottom line is, the movie shouldn't have been boycotted for being blasphemous by those who didn't see it. It should've been panned by those who DID see it for being PAINFULLY BORING. See the ""Jesus"" film instead. It doesn't attempt to make an art movie about a God made in man's image and is far more interesting."
2,"Interesting, But Unnecessary...","Scorcese's film is certainly unique and raises some good questions. Those critical of so-called ""religious zealots"" (see review below) should remember that no one who has attacked the film is denying that Christ was also human. But being tempted and actually sinning are two different things. According to Biblical account, for Christ's crucifixion to have meant anything at all, he had to be sinless. Thus, a Christian like myself would be expected to take offense at a film like this. At the same time, I understand the questions Scorcese was raising with the film, and there are some valid points. I know Jesus was tempted; it is referenced in the Scriptures. But the humanity of Christ could have been portrayed in a more subtle way. On top of all that, I just found it to be a pretty boring piece of film - from Scorcese, of all people. Time seemed to slow down for awhile there. Two hours felt a lot longer, and that's just poor filmaking..."
3,A good effort with a few distractions,"This is a fascinating look at Jesus's dual nature; what he might have been; the struggles and confusion he must have endured; what kind of life he would have had if he had not submitted himself to be sacrificed.These are the strongest aspects of the story, and the locations in Morocco are perfect. Also, David Bowie gives a too-short performance as Pontius Pilate.That said, I found the New York and other modern accents from many of the actors to be distracting, and some of the scenes could have been more effective or tightened up. The scenes with John the Baptist and his raving lunatic followers were rather bizarre as well."
3,Makes sense of the sacrifice,"If Jesus KNEW he was God's son, would live forever in heaven, was above human frailty and temptation, and etc etc then WHERE is the sacrifice? Even on the cross he is to have asked why his father had forsaken him. To me, that is the essence which this film depicts. It is a totally human portrait and Jesus was allegedly on earth to suffer FOR us. I would not have accepted what he accepted because I am human. Therefore, the film portrayal of a guy who thinks, ""I could be happily married, making love, having a family, enjoying my friends, etc etc"" and yet STILL ACCEPTS the ultimate scarifice and all that he relinquished to do that makes this a moving portrayal of Jesus...I would walk through fire if I were wearing a flame retardant suit. I would not even have to think TWICE about it if I were in my streetclothes: NO WAY. This Jesus wore his street clothes and did it for us. Impressive."
3,Scorsese Yes - Dafoe No,"Another solid directorial effort by the brilliant Martin Scorsese - cinema-wise and in his effort to portray the human side of Jesus. But someone forgot that Jesus was a charismatic person, one who was followed diligently by many disciples and who enchanted crowds and crowds with his teachings, healings and general overall power, both of personality and message-bearing. Willem Dafoe just does not fill that role, but comes across as a wimp manipulated by, of all the followers, Judas Iscariot. (Maybe that was supposed to be humorous?) Dafoe's portarayal is too weak, more of a wimpy follower than a charismatic leader."
4,jesus reconsidered,"Most Christians dismissed this film as heresy (which it was), but I liked it because it made Jesus very human to me and reminded me that ""we do not have a high priest who cannot empathize with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are, yet without sin"" (Hebrews 4:15)."
4,A very spiritual film,"No matter your religious affiliation this well done and well acted movie is quite amazing. Although I am not a christian I found the ending (self sacrifice) to be quite a powerful message. My only complaint, sometimes the modern day accents took you out of the story."
5,The most personal is the most universal....,Did anyone bother to notice the beginning statement that this movie is a representation not of the biblical Christ but a representation the common human experience that each of us embrases upon birth??? This is a story of the deep personal journey that we ALL take. Jesus was no exclusion. He is the ulimate expression of how to overcome the world.
3,freakin ripoff,"haven't bought it. just pi$$ed that a DVD is so expensive. i'm tired of having no other choice but to buy these stupid special editions i'll pay $25 tops for this. hopefully they'll either lower the price or release a ""regular"" edition. then maybe i'll buy it and change my review"
2,Weak Performance by Dafoe Mars Story,"I read ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" as a book and thought it was great - very thought-provoking novel on an alternate story of the life of Jesus. Unfortunately, Martin Scorsese's adaptation just isn't up to the level of the book. His greatest mistake was in casting Willem Dafoe in the lead role (Christ). Clearly, Dafoe was in way over his head. His acting is so bland and weak, there isn't much to admire in his performance of perhaps the most famous person in the history of the world. Supposedly, Scorsese first offered the role of Christ to Robert DeNiro, who turned it down. Now, this movie with DeNiro as Christ would have been worth watching."
5,Excellent Film,"This Film has made my top 5 list. Great soundtrack,Directing and casting make a great film. out of all the people I have seen play Jesus, William Dafoe has done the best job I ever seen"
2,Just plain silly,The only thing I found offensive about this movie was the bad acting and directing. The director got the costumes and dialect for this period all wrong. They made no effort to adjust the way they talk or structure their sentences..The actor's accents are hilarious and embarrassing. I didn't know that Jesus was from California!!!
2,Disappointing,"There's a fascinating story to be told about the internal struggle between Jesus's humanity and his divinity, but this movie botches it, mainly by interrupting its most powerful moment with a 20 minute tangent that, for all intents and purposes, negates that struggle (Jesus essentially gets to have his cake and eat it, too.) The last temptation is a good idea, but it could have been integrated into the film much more effectively. As it is, it is contrived, convoluted, and worst of all, anticlimactic. That said, there are genuinely strong segments and intriguing concepts here. But for a much more fulfilling experience, I suggest just listening to Peter Gabriel's brilliant soundtrack in a dark room with a lot of volume."
5,Worship this movie,"This movie is a direct portrayal of what happened in the bible. word for word, spoken by god himself. he mostly talked to the author of the book and then talked to scorcese just to help him out to make this movie as authentic as possible. since this is god's word, all of you must hail to this historical piece and light candles with the image of the virgin mary imprinted upon them.thou shall watch temptation of christ should be the 11th commandment. watch it or go to hell!"
1,I wish that I could have rated it lower.,The Bible warns against taking from or adding to the scripture. The people who were involved in the movie are treading on dangerous ground.It make me sick to say the least
1,Should have never been made...,"What's this bullcrap? You're gonna call The Passion of The Christ garbage and say that this film of lies and blasphemy is cinematic gold? You're all wrong. This film should have never been made. It's a disgrace to humanity, it's a drain on the economy, it's totally useless crap.Scorsese, spend 15 years working on how to make a real biblical epic instead of this trash.There's my opinion."
1,All over the place,I don't think there is one accurate scene in this entire film. It's like Scorsese skimmed the Gospels and took a few familiar things he heard when he was a child and tossed it all together into this horrific mess. The only reason non-believers love it is because it gives them false ammunition to throw at Christians. I finally understand where some of the ignorant statements of non-believers come from now. For that I am glad I've seen the film now I can more easily identify a Martian (Marty follower) when I see one.
1,bogus to the point of insulting,"good movie, if you do not include Jesus and the gospel. be careful what you film or write about or paint, or create. when you bring in the Truth, make sure it is true. as a movie about Jesus, it is very very insulting and not true. if marty s really believes in what he has created, then i pray for forgiveness on his behalf. we are human and all make mistakes (except Jesus/God), and alas marty made a big one here."
4,subtle point - not a full review *CONTAINS SPOILERS*,"I both read the book and saw the movie years ago when it was first released. My recollection is that while Jesus does ""marry and/or consummate"" with Mary Magdeline as many of the reviewers before me have mentioned, she immediately dies, and he then marries Mary the sister of Lazarus, with whom he raises a family.Regardless, I found the duality of man/God as presented in both the book and the movie to be incredibly moving. In fact the ""temptation"" placed before Jesus in this story seems far more powerful to me than even those placed before him in the books of the New Testament.All in all, I loved the book and the soundtrack, and liked the movie."
4,decide for yourself,"I will never understand why some people feel that they have the right to critique a movie they have never seen. If you have a thirst for knowledge than maybe you should expose yourself to a view outside of the one the christian church offers. If your faith is strong than this movie will not affect you. Everyone is entiled to their own taste and opinions, but don't let the opinion of others influence you. Those who believe in God know that God gave us free will so that we could choose for ourselves."
4,The religious zealots have this movie all wrong.,"It is unfortunate that this movie brought about so much controversy for what is essentially a favorable depiction of Jesus. He is not militant, nor arrogant as he is, sometimes, in the Gospels of the New Testament. The 'temptation' in which he falls victim to is not one that can be perceived by any man as selfish. He wants but a simple life; family and love. It is only when he is confronted with the fact that his death did not serve as his destiny willed that he realizes the implications of his actions. It is then that he chooses, as someone who knows what he is giving up, to become the martyr in which has been predestined for him. IF I were a Christian, I would feel that this Jesus, who struggled with himself and his faith and eventually made the ultimate sacrifice, to be a worthy representative of a religious doctrine and a valid teacher."
5,ARTISTIC MASTERPICE,"I don`t believe in God but I love the work of Martin Scosese, God of all directors. This film is a truly masterpiece, a brilliant music score by Peter Gabriel, great actors. Harvey Keitel plays Judah in a very professional and affectional way. Willem Dafoe deserved an Oscar for his interpretation, Barbara Hershey plays wonderful her part, very beautiful back. Harry Dean Stanton and David Bowie are also great in their roles. Martin Scorsese gave the film a very fashionable look, fast and modern, Peter Gabriel`s Passion taking the film over the controversial top."
4,the last temptation of Christ within you,"I've never read the novel this movie is based on, but I've seen the movie a couple of times. I honestly don't understand why so many Christians are upset about it. Here in Sweden, some fundamentalist group always cry ""Provocation"" and ""Conspiracy"" whenever the movie is re-run on television, especially if it's close to Easter. I don't see the movie as anti-Christ or anti-Christian. Rather, I see it as a allegory of man's spiritual seekership. The ""Jesus"" of the movie is a symbol for each of us. Jesus is called by God. He has doubts. He even refuses. On the cross, he feels abandoned, perhaps betrayed, by God: ""Why hast thou forsaken me?"". The Devil sees his chance and tempts him. But, finally, Jesus sees through the temptations, ""returns"" to the cross, and dies victoriously, as the true Son of God: ""It is accomplished"".I'm not a practicing Christian myself, bur honestly, is this anti-Christian?"
2,Not very bright.,If you're looking for something bright then look somewhere else. I could barely see them when lit up at night.
5,YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS THIS THING,"What a great voice she has! Sweet, broken, loud, soft, loud... every thing to make a ballad sound magnificently.Only a native from Georgia (as Brenda) can sing Georgia On My Mind with that sincere emotion, I know the original and several versions of Funny How Time Slips Away, Brenda's rendition is absolutely the best of all, listen to Sweet Memories, Crying Game, I Left My Heart in San Francisco, just to mention a few of this excellent compilation.I listen to this CD over and over and never get tired, each time it is a pleasure.I have the CD that Brenda recorded in 1991; I wait for another CD of new recordings. Hey producers: don't miss the opportunity, you find a voice like hers only once in a lifetime.I also wait for another compilation like this one, without the current hits of Brenda that, of course, I already have too."
5,Wonderful collection,"This is a wonderful compilation of Brenda Lee's ballads, no one a big hit for her, most of them are cover versions, but they sound beautifully with her gifted voice, some of them better than the originals. Waiting for more to come , she deserves more CD releases without repeating the hits , we already have all her hits, her catalog is very rich and more CDs like this one should be released.For those who love ballads: Highly recommended!"
5,Great ! This Lady sounds better than ever,"Soft, romantic and lovely. You feel like Brenda Lee is in the same room singing to just you. A must for every fan, baby boomer and romantic"
5,An Great Cd From Air Supply,Here's another great cd from that super group Air Supply and believe it or not it's their first cd from Australia and take it from me buy it and you will enjoy it.Rondall
5,Lost it and copped it a 3rd time!,I purchased this retail and my cd case was stolen. I scratched the second copy I bought up and then lost it. this is the third time I bought this cd after 4 years and I am amazed all over again.This kids are off the hook. Biv gettem back on track!!!! Our kids need something clean and raw to listen to other than hokey kids songs.And where are Shanice and Lil Leah?
3,Just an average single,"I do have to say that ""Flagpole Sitta"" is one of my favorite songs of all-time. But buying this single doesn't make too much sense. Only if you are a HUGE Harvey Danger fan do you need this CD. Along with the hit, you'll also find the song ""Wrecking Ball"". It's a good song and quite different from the style of ""Flagpole Sitta"". But it's also on their full-length CD Where Have All The Merrymakers Gone. The only reason you should consider buying this single is if you're looking for rare Harvey Danger songs; that being ""The Ballad Of The Tragic Hero (Pity And Fear)"". This song you can't find anywhere else and it's hard to find a download of it. Believe me, I've tried.I gave this CD-single 3 stars because all three songs are good. Yet you should just buy their full-length CD instead. You'll get more for your money and 10 great songs rather than just three."
5,One of the greatest songs ever!,Flagpole Sitta is a definite hit. I mean I dont know how you can't like it. It has catchy lyrics (example: paranoia paranoia everybody's comin to get me) and a great sound to it. The guitar on it goes excellent with the lyrics and Seans voice singing them makes all the better. Wrecking Ball (also on the cd) is a softer ballad of the destruction that we all face. Show me the hero (a b-side on the cd) is a great song. It seems oddly appropiate for this cd. To bad this the only cd it's on. If you like Flagpole Sitta then you should also look into getting these cds. Where Have All The Merrymakers Gone? (Harvey Danger) King James Version (Harvey Danger) Saint Joe On The Schoolbus (Marcy Playground) Febuary Son (Oleander) Unwind (Oleander) Feeling Strangely Fine (Semisonic) Fortress (Sister Hazel) Sugar (Tonic) Live and Enhanced (Tonic) Lemon Parade (Tonic) and Out of Time (R.E.M.)
4,"If you haven't heard it yet, listen to it!!!","This song by Harvey Danger is a masterpiece. I really enjoyed it. One thing that alot of people say about him, is that he is a younger Drew Carrey! I totally agree, but he sounds a hell of a lot better. Check this song out, take you ear drums for a treat!"
3,A description....,"From Back Cover:Something had seized his mind, something that rode his body like a speed-maniac would drive a stolen car - for he had committed atrocities against his friends and neighbors, he had done unspeakable things - and yet his own conscious mind had only stood aside and watched in horror. For a demonic intelligence had taken over inside his skull and left him a helpless oserver.He was not unique. It was happening all over the world - society was breaking down in an epidemic of crimes, vicious and senseless, and it would seem as if the world had been invaded by a legion of invisible devils from some interplanetary hell.There had to be a solution, and when at last he found a clue, he set out to pursue it to the bitter end."
2,Marginal at Best,"You've got to be kidding when you say that this works as advertised. This item performs poorly. And, yes, I primed it with hot water for at least 5 minutes. It was a big disapointment."
2,Not Thrilled,"Marty the Monkey and Gerard the Giraffe take us on a journey thru the parables found in Matthew five, seven, and twenty. The idea is to bring humor into the stories do a child will be interested and learn. However my children- aged 10, 8,7 and 5 were bored even before the first parable was finished being explained. I am sure some children would like this but mine didn't.I received this dvd free of charge thru Thomas Nelson Book Sneeze and I am free to give my honest opinion."
4,Unexpected,"I received this as a mommy blogger. I was not sure as to what to expect and was nervous about it. My 2 yr old thought the colors and all of the verbage and the excitement of it was great. It really captured her attention for sure. It did speak of the teachings as well and I thought that was great but felt that some of the scenes were a tad graphic. My two year old did not seem to mind though. When she gets older and we can chat more about the stories, I will explain in better detail to her the reasoning's behind each message."
2,Disappointing,"This DVD was very disappointing. The cartoon stories were supposed to relate to parables in the Bible, but the link to the actual parables was obscure at best. Fortunately, the titles of the parables were displayed on screen at the beginning of each story, otherwise I may not have even been able to tell what parable they were trying to illustrate. The physical violence was higher than what I prefer to let my boys watch (think Bugs Bunny style cartoon violence). There are many secular cartoons that are less violent and have a better story and more redeeming or educational messages. Overall, the cartoons were forgettable as a secular cartoon which makes it downright disappointing as a Christian one."
5,Loved it,"I loved Adventures in Boogabooga Land it was cute in my brother and mother loved the ways each story explain the parables of jesus. They never ready the back so the would guess which parable would come next. Each character each scene helped explain would jesus ment when he spoke these parables 10/10 it was great.I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze.com book review bloggers program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255"
2,Dissapointed,"I've been listening to ICP for approx 10 years now, and I love all of the old material. But, this cd is just WAAYYY too BORING. It sucks that I have to say that, cause I was hoping for better. Alot of people will like it just because they feel like they ""have to"" because they'd be ""Un-loyal"" as ""Juggalos"". So they will force themselves to like it. But truly it is not a good album at all. Yeah, I know mike clark did some of the tracks, but it's not even classic mike clark style. It just plain sucks. Especially compared to old s@#t.Shaggy actually attempts to ""rap"" on most of the songs and it just aint happenin'. And also, the hooks are not really ""hooks"" because they don't ""hook"" anything but my finger to push the ""change disk"" button on my cd player. Not recommended."
4,Family knows him personally,"Shaggy is the bomb and hears why. My family knows his family personally. He is an extremely devoted family man. He would do anything for his wife and kids. They are together everyday. Even when he is on tour, his family is with him. I look up to him because even with all the fame and fortune he stays real and knows how to take care of bussines. Ive met his wife a few times and she is the bomb too. His kids are the coolest lil ninjas I ever met. He's got a great family, awesome career and good morals. He is definitely someone I look up to."
4,cotton shrinks,"but if you account for that when you pick a size, it should be fine. my boyfriend loves his!"
3,not worth the money,"very well produced, and edited, but the fights are not exciting at all. They're all great fighters, but there is so much clinching going on. And the royce gracie fight goes on for 1.5 hours, with a very dissapointing ending. try a different PFC dvd, this one ""[is not good]""."
4,Better than the opening round!,"I liked this one better because I found more of the fights interesting. Warning: the Royce Gracie v. Kazushi Sakuraba fight took forever and was not as exciting as Sakuraba's fights usually are. Not strong in the submissions arena, but lots of striking action. Includes all the big names: Igor Vovchanchyn, Ken Shamrock, Mark Kerr, Mark Coleman."
4,Classic Fights.,"Hey, I picked this up cheap, wasn't expecting much. I was happy to be proven wrong, some of the fights are slower paced, but vintage Mark Coleman, and the return of Ken Shamrock on the 3rd disc is worth it by itself. There is also two excellent fights of Guy Metzger and the 90 minute showdown with Royce Gracie and Sakuraba. Overall, I would recommend this to any fight fan. (But,as much as I love amazon, I found it at kmart for 7.99)"
4,good dvd set,I just want everyone to know that I purchased this dvd yesterday at my local best buy for 19.99.
2,"Pride FC rules, but this tournament is a BORE.",I love Pride FC and never miss an event. Pride FC mma is the BEST but unfortunately this dvd is a bore. Just about all of the matches are not worth watching a second time. The only bout on this dvd worth watching is the classic Sakuraba vs Royce Gracie 90 min bout.
1,don't get ripped!,This event has been re-released! It includes the first round of this tournament with bonus features and comes in a nice metallic case! Also includes reprint of original event program! All for about $40!! Don't get ripped off by buying this overpriced inferior edition!!
3,Not too bad,"This game was ok. The only really entertaining aspects of it is driving the cars, hearing the funny radio commercials and running over people with the car. Definitely need to mute the sound around small children."
2,others are better,i do like the gta's series but this game is just the same thing wich to me is getting boring. its just not for me.
5,Works GREAT!,"It blocks out the sun! It is far better than the generic ones you find at Walmart or the auto stores. Living in Florida, this should really keep the car cool."
5,Amazing Concert!,"I was introduced to John Mayer by a band mate which lives in Maryland. The fist thing I liked from John was his tone and choice of notes, aside from his great lyrics... Oh boy! I watched his ""Any Given Thursday"" DVD and was blow away! Then I saw his Trio set... But watching this DVD really gave me some goosebumps in ""Bold As Love,"" Jimmy Hendrix Cover, and Gravity... This is an AMAZING concert and has definitely made my DVD collection! The mood is set from the start with the acoustic set... then my favorite part which is the Trio (I love the Blues raw Guitar/Bass/Drum sound), then finishing up with the complete band which is GREAT! This is the third time I buy this DVD, I have recommended this DVD to some friends that loved it and just let them have it. I am not going to support piracy, especially because I know how hard it is for this type of talent to ""make it!"" This is a MUST BUY!!!"
5,Superb,"I have been a John Mayer fan for a while, so this was one of the first Blu-ray music concerts I bought. I was pleasantly surprised by the separate solo, trio, and full band segments to this concert, and the quality of the audio and video are excellent. The way the interviews with John are handled are nicely done and interspersed well.In summary, this is a great concert and a reference quality music Blu-ray.PS. Other reviewers have commented that the ladies will love it, but when I first put it on my wife's reaction was that's the sleazebag who sleeps with all the Hollywood celebrities!"
5,Where The Light Is John Mayer,"KUDOS! Excellent, excellent, excellent! As huge John Mayer fans my husband and I love this concert DVD. Actually, 3 concert sets including an acoustic performance with his trio... very well done. We highly recommend. Also recommend Todd Agnew to contemporary Christian music fans.. one incredible artist."
5,Gets u high,"John Mayer ROCKS !! his three incarnations, all three awesome... acoustic version opens up himself so much... when in the band, he just goes with the flow and blows everyone's mind... trio is the best, John goes crazy while in trio... i loved the blues he played !! I was updating my status that how i regret so much for not being able to attend the concert, however, this dvd is worth it because u'll get the same vibe as being in the concert... in one way, this dvd is better than being in the concert because it shows u the backstage and some interview with John !!u know what u should try, get high and watch this, u'll have a euphoric moment !!"
5,John Maher dvdI,I love John Mayer so naturally I like this dvd. The three part series shows him in three different acts. They all were excellent.
3,HenE,The music is fine but why do we have to put up with his periodic pontificating on his many contributions to mankind? I purchase music DVD's to hear the tunes not the artists view of themselves or the world.
3,Solid camera work and music but self-absorbed artist,"I have been enjoying John's music for a while now but almost wish I had just stuck with listening to his music. Although the concert scenes are enjoyable and show what an incredibly talented and driven musician he is, I find it hard to get over how much he thinks of himself.The movie starts with John driving his Mercedes with his lap dog on his lap, rambling on about himself. And that's not where it stops, throughout the entire movie he keeps telling the viewer or his live audience how fantastic and succesful he thinks he is.If you like his music (which I do), rather just get the cd or download his music off the internet for free. Judging by his fancy car and watch collection he does not need the money anyway."
3,Gets old quick,"While I love the music, the DVD isn't that interesting. Infact, it gets old. But if you're one of those people who is very visual or likes to see how the band interacts, then by all means, get this DVD. Some of the behind-the-scenes footage is interesting as well as insights on what's going on in the head John Mayer. Besides that, I was bored to sleep (literally) once the the acoustic set was done... And I'm a pretty big fan! But then again, I'm one of those people who would rather see a full DVD of behind-the-scenes. Although that takes away from his point of needing ""an hour just to get people back to knowing nothing about you"".But it is great to have on in background for parties or get togethers. Or keep the audio track on. Otherwise, the John Mayer fanatic in me is completely outraged, but I can't say that recommend purchasing it."
4,Great,I like John Mayers music a lot. I think this concert was strange that he had the trio singing portion. I could have done without that but overall the quality is very good
5,What a performance!,"I highly recommend this DVD! I'm amazed with John's performance, the best i've ever seen. Two words, buy it!"
3,John Mayer- Live in LA,"In a word... a disappointment. But then you've got to remember that ""live"" music ALL of an artists work. Perhaps in time this CD will grow on me."

5,EXCELLENT!,John Mayer at his best!!! If you haven't seen this show and you are a fan of John you HAVE to see this DVD!
2,Adequate,"This text was adequate, if not somewhat antiquated. Even my instructor seemed a little annoyed with it. For my next rating, I'll look for a more in-depth test prep with more graphics and more updated material."
5,Unfortunatly.......,"unfortunatly i read part of this book yesterday at a restraunt(05/23/2000) and i can't find a copy in print. but from what i read, (i may even just call him and ask if he knows where i can get a copy), this book is very informative and aslo very usefull. if your just starting out you should alo consider; Spell Craft, by - Robin Skelton. c'ya"
5,Jacob's Ladder (not in my name) and its songs,the sessions to Jacob's Ladder (not in my name) are dark and catchy to sing along to. the songs are great! the sleevenote is truly in need of appreciation in order to fully understand and love this CD single for what it is. it's brilliant and fantastic!
5,Good Product,I really like the product because it does the job with very little product. I recommend it to anyone that likes the CREW product.
4,So sorry this product is discontinuedMy,"My husband loves this wax and it has been discontinued by Crew,this was the only place I could find it and I think I got the last jars."
5,Exactly what you'd expect,"Great price, fast shipping, and exactly as described. This is light to medium weight paper; if you were to wrap a package in it, the paper would be slightly translucent. Heavy enough to draw on, but perhaps not to paint on."
1,Does not fit in all plotters.,"Just tried this printer in my school's plotter and it appears the rod wont go in and it's not really a 40lb. roll, but 40 pounds of cheap paper."
5,Amazing,"i love Richard Bona's latest effort, Munia: The Tale. After listening to him with Bobby Mcferrin on Beyond Words, i loved his lyricism on the bass. Then in the summer, i had the pleasure of seeing him live as a guest at a mcferrin concert in montreal. His voice is amazing and its really in view on this cd. Bonatology is a beautiful introduction that really hooked me and made me want listen to every song without skipping.Im glad that he is getting more (but still not enough) recognition after touring with Metheny. so get this cd, or any other Richard Bona cd, you won't regret it."
4,Another great CD. Spread the word!,"I first became aware of Richard Bona from his rendition of ""Redemption Song"" on Lee Ritenour's ""Twist of Marley"" CD. After that, I discovered he had performed with other artists I like, such as on Bob James's ""Joyride.""Since then, I've bought each of his CD's. Unlike some other reviewers, I don't necessarily think this is my favorite, but it doesn't matter. It's still great. You don't need to understand Richard Bona's words; his voice (like an angel's) and music convey the feeling and meaning of his songs.I wish more people knew about him. Whenever I can,I turn people on to his music."
3,Buoying below brilliant,"3 1/2If not completely captivating with an assuredly personal sound, Bona continues to smoothly dominate as one of progressive African jazz's most valued players."
4,Great item!!!!,"I have an older, silver version of this monopod (from about 2000) and I love it. It is easier to carry around than a tripod, and when you need the extra stability you can always unscrew the base and let out the ""feet"". Just make sure you never let the monopod free stand or you may find yourself looking to purchase a new camera\lens. And for those of us who have found ourselves in some less than ideal environments with expensive camera equipment, the monopod makes an excellent ""deterrent"" or club. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because the base can become difficult to screw\unscrew if it is used in an extremely sandy area, such as at the beach. I had to then take the garden hose and thouroughly rinse the base and feet of mine of for several minutes, dry them with a rag, then apply a light coating of grease to the threads. A minor inconvience."
4,DON'T EXPECT IT TO BE A TRIPOD,"It works well as a monopod. It is well built just like everything that comes from Manfrotto. It does rattle but I fixed it with a Velcro strap on the bottom. The threads are large I don't see how some users are cross threading this unit. I use tripods a lot being a landscape photographer but I wanted something with a quicker set up. I couldn't do it with this unit. IT IS NOT TO REPLACE TRIPODS. The legs are too short to create any real stability and it does not lock in place causing the unit to spin in place. What it is great for is sport photography or action photography where you have to track a subject. It takes weight off from using larger zoom lenses. It is more of an improvement for monopods then it was to replace tripods. It is also heavy for hiking. I have a SLIK MINI II tripod that weights in around 2LB and this weights twice as much. Given this I still like it as a monopod but a heavy one, and is not mean to replace tripods at all."
3,Heavy and LOOOOOONNNNNGGGG!!!!,"Don't get me wrong, this is a very, very good monopod. It is, however, very, very heavy, and very, very long, in the collapsed state! But it gets the job done, and the three little feet really help of the stability."
5,Spectres can't beat it!,"B.O.C.'s 5th studio release is a masterwork! Awesome tunes in ""Godzilla"" (is this the only song radio knows how to play! )""Golden age of leather""+ ""R.U. Ready to Rock"" are classic rock songs! Buck Dharma does an excellent job on the songs""Death Valley Nights"" and ""I Love the Night"" these are classics. When i was in college in 1979 i heard ""Nosferatu"" loved this song so much had to see the movie that came out a few months later. Awesome movie also! You can't go wrong with this disc, great collec- tion of tunes!"
3,Power Failure,"Agents Of Fortune showed that BOC were starting to mature, even though the flat out raw rockin' first three albums (aka ""The Black And White Period"")will always be my favorites. There are some good songs here, but the production is flat and lifeless. It was definitely time to ditch Sandy Pearlman(they did) and move on (the improved Mirrors with Tom Werman).""Godzilla"" and ""R.U. Ready To Rock"" are both better experienced on the live Some Enchanted Evening; a premature (only 2 more studio albums since On Your Feet Or On Your Knees)live album that was put out probably to prove that they still rocked the house in concert. Albert Bouchard, the band's weakest singer, sings too many songs on this one. I have to be in a certain mood to hear this record and it doesn't come often. My friend who turned me on to this band rates this as their best, and I definitely beg to differ."
5,The Wait Was Worth It,"I remeber waiting for BOC's next album. It seemed like forever. After the powerful Secret Treaties and then the live album on your feet or on your knees, it seemed like forever before this came out. BOC fans were nearly frantic in wanting to hear what was next. FINALLY it came out. We were not disappointed though years and otherwise forgettable albums were to come from them this was not one of them. It ROCKED, Some of the best work they ever did. Musically brilliant and very very gripping. If you like BOC you will ove this album. I think it is one of thier best and a must have."
5,"Superior to ""Agents of Fortune"" over-all","""Agents of Fortune"" to me was a let-down because I had high expectations for it given the massive and classic song featured on it. ""Spectres"" was a breath of fresh air over all as an album. To me, it sounds like a mix of their early sound fused with the sound they were going for on ""Agents"" but now that sound is perfected on this.Before I popped in the album, the song titles made me think this would be a really cheesey album. The musical craftmanship, the vocal harmonies, the guitar work, and overall composition of the music crushed any notion of this being a joke of an album; this is a force to be reckoned with.The bonus tracks are ok on this; Night Flyer and Be My Baby were probably the most successful ones.Anyway, buy this."
5,BOC Spectres,"With Spectres and Some Enchanted Evening remastered and sounding great, it's time to finish the rest of the Boc collection. Let's hope it doesn't take to much longer.The fans like us are waiting."
2,Shameless pop replaces hard rock,"That's the problem with this album. The music seems to be tired. ""Godzilla"" at least sounds like fun despite the fact that it is not a huge hit in my opinion. One and only really good song on this one is so NOT metal... it is a slow pop ballad ""I Love the Night"". Others are either very uninspired hard rock wannabes or pseudo-rock popsy tracks which were supposed to capture new audience. What did the BOC guys think? that they were going to enthrall and win over fans of The Carpenters or Boston or Peter Frampton? A very misguided experiment is what I think of this album whose issue didn't change anything in 1977 except perhaps put a couple of bucks into the pockets of music industry... but barely enough to cover a dinner for the band."
4,Slightly improved sound,"Spectres is not my favorite BOC album, or even top three favorite but, I was so pleased with the previous BOC remasters I had to get it. For $10.99 it was money well spent.The remaster slightly improves the overall sound and clarity of the album and while the packaging is slightly less robust than the remasters of the first 4 BOC albums, it certainly has more to offer than the original cd release.The bonus tracks are leftovers from the same recording sessions that yielded the album so I wasn't expecting anything fantastic. That said, I actually think Night Flyer is a stonger track than one or two of the tracks that made the original Spectres. Also, M For Murder is decent as is their cover of Be My Baby (surprisingly).Overall a very solid remaster. I have already ordered the Legacy Edition of Some Enchanted Evening and as someone mentioned earlier...Where is the remaster of On Your Feet Or On Your Knees???"
3,"Excellent music, flawed recording","Imagine viewing a masterpiece in a museum through a gauze filter and you have my impression of this album. Every song is a near classic with Golden Age of Leather, Death Valley Nights, and of course, Fireworks, as particular standouts. But it suffers from 70'as recording standards and is disappointing aurally; my first impression was that it sounded like it was being played though a 5"" PVC pipe (and sounded worst through flat-response studio headphones).I'm conflicted because I love the album and you get used to the sound eventually, but when lesser-known bands such as Uriah Heep make the admirable effort to remaster their classics, I have to wonder why BOC won't do the same. Therefore I can't give it the 5 stars it would otherwise deserve.In short, Spectres is a work of art that is in desperate need of restoration."
3,A refreshing lack of irony,"Blue Oyster Cult doesn't make any more sense lyrically than they ever did but this album has delicious hooks (""I Love the Night"" is the standout track), don't-think-go-with-it arena crunch (""R U Ready 2 Rock""), and beyond goofy stupid fun (""Godzilla"").There's something innocent about the whole endeavor. They sound like they're from an alternate dimension where Zep and Sabbath (and Yes) never happened to influence a million bands.I've a soft spot for all the band's work, at least through Fire of Unknown Origin. The Revolution By Night has several contenders for worst rock song ever recorded. BOC is tough to objectively defend but Agents of Fortune and Spectres are both definitely worth owning. Add the later single ""Fire of Unknown Origin"" and the debut's ""Then Came the Last Days of May"" and that should be enough for most listeners. Toss in ""She's as Beautiful as a Foot"", also from the eponymous debut, as a novelty to round things out."
4,An Outsider's View,"I note that all previous reviewers of this disc have definite views on how this Chinese zither should be played. I have no such claim to expertise. Rather, despite being a world-music fanatic, I have given Chinese music a wide berth, because I've had a visceral aversion to the whining slides I hear from most of the nation's classical or traditional fare.I'm pleased to report that I heard no such whine from this recording and was therefore free to assess it unencumbered. What I heard was some tonally intriguing and emotionally subdued playing that compared favorably to other Asian zither music (Japanese koto, Korean guyaguem) I have in my collection. What I miss here is more rhythmic variety and a more forceful attack. Whether that's a characteristic of the instrument or of Li Xiangting, I'm not in a position to know. I wonder whether what a critical reviewer misses here is that characteristic Chinese whine."
2,Early production of Li Xiangting?,"I am a guqin player myself and I am a bit disappointed with this CD. It appeared to me that it might be one of Mr. Li's early productions. The finger techniques, the excessive heavy touch on the strings, the unwanted metallic string echos, and the qin sound quality. None of it is up to his current level. Some of his other CDs are much better than this one. I enjoy Mr. Li's concert - his left hand movement is very mature,smooth, and impeccable. His right hand (finger flickings) is still a bit FORTE. The majority of guqin songs/music are for express yearning and to convey emotion and inspiration. If guqin music is delivered forte, it might not be able to convey and express the balance of ancient Chinese Philosophy - everything in balance and median, not too Yin (soft) or too Yang (hard). There is another well known profound guqin player in US, Mr. Wu Ziying. I have one of his CDs - I enjoy it very much.I am going to request Amazon.com to carry Mr. Wu ZiYing's CD."
4,The Vampire as hero,"This film is on my list to get in the unlikely event that it makes it to DVD, since it comes to mind every time I discuss vampire movies.Young women are turning up dead in Los Angeles in places where they draw attention like shop windows. They have been drained of blood from a bite on the neck. Looking for others of his kind, a vampire flies in from Europe to investigate the killings with a vampire-obsessed girl from a detective agency. A film maker is watching all the death sites, determined to catch a vampire feeding on film.Haunted by images of death that seem to be coming from the victims, the vampire hunts for the killer. Weak and trapped with the detective, it seems he must feed on her to live and bring the killer to an appropriate justice.It's been so long since I saw the film, I can't remember if the acting was particularly good but the idea of the vampire as the good guy and the surprise ending made it one of the most memorable vampire stories I've seen."
3,Stopped functioning after 90 days,"Worked well, especially in closed off or semi-closed small to medium rooms. Unfortunately, one cold nite it powered on but would not produce any heat. Tried turning it off, leaving it sit, plugging into other outlets in the house, etc. but same result: powered on but no heat. Now I need to incur the manufacturer return shipping costs as well as finding an odd shaped box to utilze, etc. They tell me it remains under warranty and will be replaced."
5,Nice little heater,"I purchased two of these to heat the lower level of my house until we can afford to install a wood stove. Very comfortable, automatic heat level. Hmmm, maybe I don't need that woodstove after all...It's a heater that does what it is supposed to do and is practically silent in operation. Can't ask for more than that."
2,"Started out well, but now ineffective","This heater worked well when it first arrived. It heated my 8 x 15 office quickly. It did have some unpleasant smell at first, as noted by others, but it didn't take long to dissipate. However, it has progressively been much less effective in heating this room. What I really don't like is the way the heat is dispersed. The pics look like half of the front is a grill for the heat to come from. This is not correct. All of the heat comes out of the top, and the top of the BACK! There is no way that this heater can be placed next to a wall, or even under anything. Any object directly behind or above will be subjected to constant, intense heat whenever the heater is turned on. I would definitely not recomment this product to anyone."
1,Crapped out,My recent purchase of the Honeywell 617 turned out to be a bad deal. It compltely failed after approximately less than 2 months of operation
2,"Worked Well For Year, Now It Doesn't Work at All","I bought this heater almost exactly 1 year ago and based my decision on the reviews at Consumer Reports. The heater worked very well from the start and did a great job of heating my spot in the office that is always very cold during the winter.However, about 2 weeks ago, the heater started shutting off for no apparent reason and it would take quite awhile to get it to restart. Today, I can't get it to do anything. The power light lights up, but the fan does not run and the unit does not heat up, no matter what setting I choose.Since I bought it directly from Amazon, I'm hopefull (based on other reviews) that I'll be able to return or exchange it without much hassle. Fingers crossed."
2,Failed after a month and a half,I bought two of these heaters after reading good reviews. I have one heater in a poorly insulated entry way and another in my children's attic area and the one in the attic is doing nothing but blowing cold air today. I only use the product in the evening and only for a little over a month; unacceptable! My next move is to try for a replacement and I will post how that turns out.
2,"Nice, but doesn't last.","I first purchased this unit around 4 years ago and it was working great in my townhome, adequately warming up the living room without making it too toasty. But the 3-way off-on-fan switch broke after around 15 months, and it was replaced by Honeywell for free (except for shipping). The replacement worked just as good as the first one - meaning that it no longer works after it was plugged in a few weeks ago, red off/on light doesn't come on, no heat comes out. It's time to buy a different model heater, maybe also from a different manufacturer."
3,space heater,"We needed a space heater for a cooler room. The Honeywell is very silent, the heat just really radiates. The fan does not really push the air out into the room. The unit is pretty big and heavy. It is a little difficult to move about. I think there may be better choices..."
1,Ran my electric bill up $200 a month,"I had this heater for less than one month and only ran it at night and my electric bill went up $200.00. I have heated an entire 2,000 sq. ft. home for years for less than $300 a month for years. I thought this heater would be perfect to keep one bedroom a little warmer during the winter. Hopefully I can return it and buy another blanket instead."
5,AT LAST--HEAT WITHOUT NOISE OR SMELLS!,"This is the latest generation of these excellent heaters. There is no sound, no smells (just let it gas out in your garage for a day or two, turning it on and off) and it is light enough to move from room to room SINCE THEY HAVE RUN OUT OF THESE, JUST LIKE THEY SOLD OUT OF THE TWO VERSIONS BEFORE IT!! Someone is asleep at the switch re: these great heaters."
3,I Can SMELL The Heat,"I just purchased this heater and have had it plugged in for about 10 minutes now. The one thing I can tell you for certain is that this heater SMELLS -- and I don't mean that in a good way.Some heaters smell of electricity when you turn them on and this one is no exception. (I'm actually debating right now whether to go turn it off because I truly can't stand how bad it smells!)Even if this heater could heat my entire home, I think I would return it. The smell of electricity is very unpleasant -- and probably quite unhealthy too!EDIT: After several hours of use, the smell stopped. This is a decent little heater -- though I think you could find better. (Check out the Soleus MS-09 -- it's gotten some great reviews so far). If you are content with an average heater, this one might be right for you. It operates silently when the fan isn't on. (As another reviewer mentioned, the ""Quick-heat"" fan function is basically useless).Happy shopping!"
1,Garbage.,"This unit stopped working the first day of use. It has a shut off mechanism that cannot be reset by the user - it needs to be sent back to the factory to be reset, which is more money and time than it is worth. Garbage!"
1,Recommended by Consumer's Report,"I bought two of these heaters because of the Consumer's Reports high rating. One of the two did not work out of the box. I returned the non-functioning heater and Amazon made it right and sent me another at no cost.Now one of the two heaters has burned out its element. That's 2 out of 3 heaters failing with no or little use. I have never had such poor luck with any product. With shipping charges, the 3 year warranty is like throwing good money after bad.Don't buy this product! I have also started to wonder about Consumer's Reports."
2,Silent for sure,"Its silent alright, you can plug it in and forget its even there. Tried to use in my living room left running overnight and came down stairs to a frigid room, couldn't even tell it was running unless you stand over it and feel a slight warm breeze. Its fine in a 8 x 9 room constantly running with the door shut but not in a room any larger."
2,BROKE AFTER 1 MONTH!!!!!,"The only reason I am giving this product 2 stars is that while it worked it was a very effective heater. Ours broke after 1 month of very light use. Of course, this happened after the return window expired from Amazon. When I called Honeywell they instructed me to return the item AT MY OWN COST and wait 4-6 weeks for a return. If only Honeywell's customer care were better I would be able to have more positive feedback. SUCKY COMPANY!!!!!!!!!!Sincerely,Pissed in Bucks Co. PA"
1,"This heater looked great, but only worked a few days","I bought this heater hoping that the name Honeywell meant something, and it would be a good heater despite a few bad reviews. Not so! Do NOT waste your money on one. Seller sent it promptly at a bargain price. It seemed of good quality & warmed the small room I put it in quickly & quietly.....for a few days. Then the heat unit quit, the fan only blew cold air and there was nothing I could do to get the heat to begin again. Great while it worked...just didn't work long. AMAZON, tho DID back it, and refunded my purchase money & shipping costs, BLESS 'EM. I loved the silent heat ""glow"" as a function choice...with no fan blowing; or else fan forced air. Most heaters do NOT have this feature. Maybe that's what wears it out so quickly."
4,"No Power Light,works good though","I got this for my bathroom,which after recieving it,the first thing manual states is Do Not Use In The Bathroom,and the lights,power light,does not come on.It does heat,but I'm afraid to use too long.Not what I thought I was getting. did not work for bathroom,but does a good job in living room.I think it needed a larger space to work properly,light still doesn't work."
2,An almost useless heater,"I bought the heater to warm up a glass-enclosed porch this winter. At even the highest settings, the heater gives off very little warmth, and then only within a few feet of the appliance. The porch is small, about 12' x 6', so from reading other reviews, I expected the heater to be adequate for the space. It isn't. It is very quiet, but without warmth, that means little."
2,Dam fan,"I bought this heater last year and it worked okay. The mechanical control switch that decides if the small fan runs or not seemed stiff and by the end of the season I had concerns. This year, it worked less than a month when I began to notice a burned electrical odor. The switch definitely gave out and I have safety concerns. It is not designed to be serviced as all the fasteners are rivets or I would already have it apart to learn more. Highly recommend other choices."
3,Honeywell HZ-617 Low Profile Silent Comfort Heater,"Heats quickly, cools quickly so you don't burn yourself moving it, but after a season or two it tends to get rather noisy when the fan feature is running. It does a nice job of radiant heat in a small space, such as under a desk, but is not very good for larger spaces on that setting. I had three of these units heating a house space of approx 1000 sq feet with cold tile floors in the dead of winter (Florida - temps 40's-50's) and the house was pretty comfortable. The cost is fair for what you get and I have not worn out any of the three units at this time, nor was my electrical bill appreciably higher when using them, so they are pretty energy efficient."
1,dead after 1 season,"heater died after 1 winter season(new england)i would not buy againnormally i though honeywell as a quality producti think that no longermaybe in the future ill try them again,but for now they lost my business"
2,a different Quiller,Not a great sequel to Quiller. Would have liked Quiller to get his revenge but that doesn't fit him unless it was a woman that was injured. Too much mind games and a non plausible villain. Not one of his best novels but it is still about Quiller and worth collecting.
3,works good for the money,its cheap it looks cheap it feels cheap and it is cheap but it works no leaks dose what its meant to cant complain
5,Alternate Use,"This Filter/Regulator is in use on a compressed air tank which is the air supply for air-brushing. The item provides better pressure control than the primitive regulator that comes with the tank, and, since air-brushing requires very clean air, re-filters the air (which first passes thru the compressor filter when the tank is re-filled)"
1,garbage,it's garbage. i plumbed it into the system (less than 120 psi). worked in the shop the rest of the day. came into the shop the next morning to the compressor running and air and water vapor spraying out of the regulator adjustment. the compressor ran all night and was smoking hot. this piece is garbage. do NOT rely on it. returning on monday. rated one star because it wouldn't let me put in no stars.
1,2 of these didn't last more than a few days...,"I bought 2 of these because I branched off of my lines and had one that was far from the compressor. So one was the first item off of the compressor and it failed first. It leaks constantly. I swapped it out with the other one that was a good distance from it and it worked well for about 3 days. Then it started leaking. These things are worthless. And despite that, I still have it on there and the noise of the air leaking is aggravating enough, but moisture is getting through too. The bowl barely has any in it so it is just passing right through. Junk!"
2,line filter regulator,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap ,cheap. I guess yopu get what you pay for. Cheap, cheap, cheap."
1,Retardation or what??,Sorry! I am an Anne Geddes fan through and through but I can not see spending this kind of moula for a tote bag. I mean come on where are the bells and whistles to this bag and it truly does not seem functional. Fashionable yes...Functional no!!!
3,Good & Bad,"We received this book as part of our 2nd grade Christian homeschool curriculum. The good part about this book is that it shows the county on the map and gives a few facts about the country ( major export, major religion, language etc.). The bad thing about this book is that for each country, it gives a story of how a missionary came in and saved the day. Some of these stories seem far fetched and made up, not believable. I'd like more facts about the country and it's people."
2,I really want to like it but...,"I love that this book is such a needed look at the countries and people of the world from a Christian perspective. BUT I think the tone is rather judgmental at times. Yes, all people need to know the love of God in Christ Jesus, but judging other Christian denominations as ""not really knowing Jesus""... Or judging nations that ""claim"" to be Christians still needing the gospel versus a revival? You may agree with the authors viewpoint, but Christians evangelizing other Christians and judging the state of salvation of other Christians is something I am very against and do not want to instill in my children. It's too bad because I really do love the idea of exposing my kids to the varied nations of the world and praying for each of them. And as another reviewer said, the stories do seem very heavy handed and contrived... And there really is not a lot of depth to coverage of the culture/ nation... Only enough to conclude at the end that they need to be evangelized."
3,"Kids are learning, some criticism","My kids are learning about geography through this book, which we read from about 3 time a week. We learn something about the people and the terrain and about Christian missionary efforts world wide. They may not see or read glimpses of specific types of people without this book and I am pretty happy about that. I think the personal stories sound artificial and they are too short to really care much for the character of each singular blurb. Also they mention a movie called ""The Jesus Movie"" I don't get the emphasis on the showing of that movie. It almost sounds like marketing for the movie and I guess it's going to work because I want to see what it is they are talking about. Great for other home school families that want some geography and anthropological exposure."
4,"Not quite what I expected, but I like it","First, I have no idea how the other translations stack up against this one, but this seems to be a good translation in modern German, which is great for people (like me) who are studying the language and want both a good Bible and an up to date vocabulary. The actual format of the Bible surprised me a little bit-I've always been around the traditional, leather/bonded leather Bibles with ""Holy Bible"" in gold/silver lettering across the front. This Bible has a green hardcover and looks more like a book than what I'm used to, but after I got used to it I found I liked it just as well, because it protects the pages and is just generally sturdier. The writing is a good, readable size-not large or bold print, but not tiny like some Bibles I've seen. Overall a good Bible I would recommend."
3,Brave Little Tailor,"I bought this because I remembered it from childhood. Only my memory didn't serve me well. I must have had a great imagination because the pictures just didn't do it for me. They weren't as lively as I remembered. Because it is a picture book, I would just assume not own this version.(my imagination can still do better than the actual illustrations). I sent it back."
2,Where are the first 8 stories?,"I bought a dog-eared copy of this collection (""Trouble is My Business"") at a book sale for $1.50 a year ago. The copy I have is thick with 12 stories. I bought this copy of ""Trouble is my Business"" to have a better copy, but was disappointed to discover that it had been whittled down to only the final four Marlowe stories. My question is, what the hell happened to the first 8 and why is Amazon.com still describing this as a collection of 12 when there are merely four? That's not jake, fellas."
3,(Kindle) Great book; bad edition,"(Kindle version review) One of my favorite writers and collections, but this is a very poor format ebook. The OCR-related typos are very annoying - they aren't uniform, it's as though several pages, scattered through the book, weren't edited or checked at all."
3,Not the best Chandler,"Trouble is My Business is a collection of short stories with different PI heroes. The stories are a mixed bag and not nearly at the level of the full-length novels featuring Philip Marlowe. Read it if you must. Better yet, read Elmore Leonard or Robert B. Parker."
3,I like the novels better...,"I think that these stories varied a lot in quality and impact...would definitely be more likely to use ""Weep No More, My Lovely"" or my personal favorite ""the Long Goodbye"" to show someone who didn't know how awesome and descriptive Raymond Chandler's writing is. I love the title, though."
1,Siberian Husky DVD,"I really hate to give a bad review, but I did not like this video at all. It was boring and repetative and showed the same puppy over and over."
3,Not for real beginners,"I purchased this book as a supplement to the beginning Italian classes I am taking once a week. I started on Chapter One expecting the lessons to build on each other as stated in the preface. I initially found that the review exercises throughout the chapter require some vocabulary words that were never introduced. I'm okay with that much but the last exercise in the book (1.11) asks for English language sentences to be translated into Italian without any instruction on pronouns, verbs or sentence structure whatsoever! The preface recommends that you follow the book chapter by chapter and not jump around the book but this exercise could not possibly be completed only using the first chapter. You definitely need a basic understanding of the language before using this book. I'm continuing with these lessons hoping that the rest of the book is better organized and less frustrating as I go along!"
3,"Good, with flaws.","I opened the book to page XV, and at the bottom of the page there is a glaring error. This could have been avoided by opening a good dictionary.Three Italian words are presented as examples of words with their accent on the third-to-last syllable. Unfortunately, that is not where the accent goes on these words."
5,Great!,"I am a fan of audio dramatizations, and this one I have listened to over and over. Excellent production value!"
4,"More like 3 1/2, most songs are worth it","This CD has some of the most bangin tracks of the last year or so, but the CD does not know what it wants to be. Rap? R-n-B? Pop? Rock? I take it as being a rap album, and so I enjoyed most of the tracks. The only bad ones would be the whiny ""No, No, No"", the annoying ""Superthug"", and songs 8, 10, 11 and 12. The sleeper hits: The last two tracks, ""Lets Ride"" and ""Butta Love"". Peace"
4,"A ""MUST HAVE""!!!!!","If u like PARTY MUSIC and GOOD MUSIC, this is the CD for you. Not only does it if the newest music, it has GOOD MUSIC!!!!!!!"
3,only had a couple of artist worth talking about,"the only artist I would buy the CD for is Destiny Child,Peter Gunz"
5,"why is this book ""out of print""??","This true story MUST be told and read by everyone! What horrors took place and how Dr. Perl was involved and what she saw, unbelieveably moving. I cried. If you can not find or afford to buy this book...get the DVD movie ""Out of the Ashes"" which does a good job of retelling the story."
1,Another broken product,"Tried to love this product but it arrived with a the LCD screen not working (second one of these in as many weeks. Seemed OK otherwise, nothing flash. Sent it back for a refund and will look elsewhere for a better quality one"
2,Dissapointed,"This dye does not go very far and barely lasted a week in my pre-bleached hair, even after letting it sit for approximately 8 hours. The color was very bright to start with, but quickly turned pale yellow. If you want NEON hair, I would suggest special effects napalm orange, I used this product and am much happier with it."
1,Not worth what I paid,"I have used Manic Panic before with great results, but this was disastrous. I bleached my hair before, just as is recommended, and when I applied the color it looked nice, a very vibrant pretty color orange. After 1 day, however, it faded to a horrible highlighter yellow. I re-dyed it three times, and each time it faded to highlighter, day-glow yellow within a day. It was awful. I even rebleached and tried again, with the same results. Do not purchase this color. I had to dye my whole head brown again to cover up this mess."
3,Okay...,"Overall this book is just okay. Some of the stories are really cute and entertaining, while others are boring and predictible. I bought it for my nephew since he doesn't really like to read I thought he might like to read something fun. I will still give it to him, but I don't know if it will hold his attention."
1,"cliche, and an embarassment","les stitches sadly believe they are a quality punk band. I had the misfourtune of sitting through their set about two weeks ago, perhaps thee most cliche band, ever. They are so typical and bland.cliche acts they did while onstage:1. singer tried too hard to be Johnny Rotten 2. singer constantly cursed, in a sad attempt to sound ""punk rock"" 4. offered no words of interest while onstage 5. they all acted like rockstars, throwing promo cd's into the tiny crowd, are you kidding me?Jeez, this band is an embarassment. They also seem to lift a lot of riffs from Bouncing Souls, which is a great band, unlike LES. No creativity, no room for growth, just nothing.,,,there are so many more bands that do it better, which is why LES don't leave NYC on tour too often."
5,Their best collection,"A boatload of great songs. ""Livin' for the Weekend"" was the song that started the weekend back in college. It is impossible to sit still, when that starts cooking, or when ""I Love Music"" opens. ""Stairway to Heaven"" (which would never be confused with Led Zeppelin's version) along with ""Hooks in Me"" are among their best love songs.Gamble & Huff created fantastic music from Philadelphia for a whole new generation of fans. The instrumental backing is tight. Their harmonies are smooth. A lot of wonderful stuff."
5,High Schoolers act out a play in How I Changed My Life.,"If you are in High School, then here is a book you might life. It's called How I Changed My Life. The school play is going to be The Diary of Anne Frank.In the book, Klye Winthrop is a football player, but quits when he suffers an injury. Klye's mom is dead, and his father re-married a woman named Jackie.Klye has a half-brother. Who is a baby. His name is Jake. But Klye's nickname for Jake is ""IT."" Against the advice of his girlfirend, Klye decides to act in the school play. His girlfriend name is Chole Frost.She will play Anne Frank. There is a girl named Bolita Vina (Bo), who talks Klye into doing the play. One Day a guy sells pizza in the boy's bathroom, to get his girlfriend a present. But ends up in jail for it. If you are in High School, then this is a book that you might like."
4,How I Changed My Life,"This book displays a very true and sad point in life. People change the way they live t, think and look like just to attract someone from the opposite sex. The main character Bo, is trying to get an All-Star quater back to ffall in love with her. She changes almost everything about herself just to please him. She decides to go out for the main part in the play ""Anne Frank"" where kyle is also going to be performing. There is only one problem, Kyle's girlfriend is determined to get that part as well. Of course she has a better chance at the part due to the fact that she is popular and a perfectionest. She is the only thing that stands in the way of Bo and Kyle being together. Bo will do anything to get that part, no matter what it takes. To find out more read the book!"
4,I agree...,"...In my opinion, this book really could boast a teen's self esteem a lot, since it is about realistic lives of 2 teens during high school. I also believe that this could help people to know how do deal with many situations by reading how the students in this book dealt with their problems. I agree that this book has a lot of foul language and there are some mature types of situations between the students, so I don't think that many young children would read this book. But this book has many exciting things that happen, that will make u want to continue reading. Since this book shows two points of views of two different people that are different sexes, it will be an interesting, and unusual type of book to read. I think that this is a good book to recommend to people too!"
4,La Sombra Del Viento,"A compelling story line, magnificently written, that combines history, politics and a quite unique love story set in a post-civil war Barcelona you can almost smell."
4,Una intriga literaria / A literary mystery.,"This novel has its defects (somewhat unbelievable main character and the profusion of clichés), but stressing those too much would be unfair to its accomplishments: an excellent rythm, intertwined plots that are a work of genius, constant tension, and all the passion that the writer poured in its telling. Sometimes it seems as if he were revealing the details of a very intimate affair.-----La novela tiene sus faltas (un personaje principal inverosimil y la profusión de clichés), pero destacarlas demasiado sería robarle sus virtudes: un ritmo excelente, un enlace de tramas que me pareció genial, la tensión constante, y toda la pasión que Ruiz Zafón derrochó en ella. A veces parece que hablara de algo que conoció muy de cerca."
3,Libro entetenido,"Es un buen libro entretenido para leer en el verano, es de lectura amena y en algunas partes un poco aburrido"
5,Excellent book.,I read this book in spanish and loved it. look forward to reading more of Zafon's work.
5,"EXCELENTE NOVELA. ROMANCE, SUSPENSO Y UN TANTO DE HISTORIA.","Seria muy complicado poder catalogar esta novela dentro de un genero especifico. Romance, suspenso y un tanto de historia uno puede econtrar en LA SOMBRA DEL VIENTO.Por ""casualidad"", en las manos de DANIEL SEMPERE cae un libro que le cambia la vida y decide aventurarse en la busqueda de su autor: JULIAN CARAX. En un principio tan solo era por curiosidad pero mientras el tiempo pasaba este se volvio un reto que le cambia la vida. A causa de su busqueda, Daniel conoce a varias personas que le ayudaran a alcanzar su fin y muchas otras que haran lo posible por verle fracasar.EXCELENTE PARA CUALQUIER MOMENTO Y, ADEMAS, APTO PARA TODO EL MUNDO."
4,La Sombra Del Viento (in Spanish),"The books is a great read from begining to end, I liked it so much I bought a copy for my mother in Spanish!"
5,la sombra del viento,"Es un libro muy rico en que se desarollan tramas, sub-tramas y ramas de sub-tramas. Ruiz Zafon escribe con toda su fuerza del corazón y muestra una Barcelona gótica y auténtica, una história estupenda!"
2,Intriguing yet unsatisfying,"This is one of those books that held my attention to the end and yet, when finished, left me thinking that the author really didn't know how to wind up the loose ends properly. Frankly, I'm sorry I wasted my time on it."
1,Infantilising pap,"This is the emperor's new clothers of recent book successes. Its appeal is the same lazy, infantilising escapism that has driven many adults to reading trash like Harry Potter with herd-like conformism. The writing is stale, even when describing the drearily fantastical, and shows a Disneyfied Barcelona akin to the London of Mary Poppins. My toes curl when I hear intelligent people gush praise over this schlock.Of course, as with all negative reviews on Amazon, this one will be judged ""unhelpful"" by those wishing to confirm their conformist hunch. But I hope a few among you won't waste your precious life with this cartoonish pap when the masterpieces of the Spanish-language canon sit unopened on your shelves, or are just a click away on Amazon."
1,"La sombra del viento, The sadow of the wind",I've been reading the first 2 chapters in the web page of the author in Spanish and I'm surprised by the simplistic modern languaje used and the topic one direction of characthers. The description of the Books sementary seems from National Treasure III... Sorry but I expected too much from this overhyped book...Kind of Da Vinci Code mixed up with culebron (Latin soap opera TV). The languaje and constructions are too simple.Perhaps this is why is a best seller? I guess you can read it in an airport or some boring wait and throw it to the garbage after.If you read a lot and like classics; this is not for you.
1,perdida de tiempo,"este es un libro intelectualoide y pedante, con grandes aspiraciones y pocas gratificaciones...escrito por alguien que obviamente se cree demasiado grande, pero escribe como un chico...personajes de carton y una historia caprichosa e infantil (para un intelectual)...por supuesto esta escrito como si fuera IMPORTANTE... pero es puro palabrerio, sin mucha substancia...buenas criticas por parte de otros intelectualoides que aman el lenguaje grandilocuente aunque sea solo gas..."
5,Increible!,"I read this book in English and loved it and thought since it was translated, the Spanish version might have so much more to offer. Since my Spanish skills are shaping up quite nicely, I bought the Spanish version. Its so pretty. I'm very happy with it."
5,No soy fanatica de la lectura.,"No soy fanatica de la lectura, no me gusta leer. El ultimo libro que lei fue hace mas de 7-8 años. Este libro me se apodero de mi con solo sus primeras paginas. Lo lei en 3 semanas."
4,His best book,"After swearing off Zafón based on his first two books, one of my Spanish teachers convinced me to give this one a try. I found it easy to read in Spanish (I have a B2-C1 level) and engaging. The characters are interesting and likeable, the story line coherent, and the resolution satisfying. Having recently read his next novel, El Juego del Ángel, I can definitely say that this is his best book."
4,Amarra la atencion,Este libro lo empeze en ingles y no podia resistir; los chistes y explicaciones tenian gracia hasta en traduccion pero tenia que leer el original. Me llego justo para tener el fin a mi gusto.Hacia tiempo que no me entretenia tanto con la historia de un joven enamorado de libros y de chicas.
4,La sombra del Viento,"I enjoyed it very much! a little slow at the beginning but then couldn't put my book down! First time reading a novel by Carlos Zafron, was very please with his style."
4,windproof fleece,I am happy with the windproof fleece jacket that I purchased from Guide Gear. It arrived quickly in the mail. I have been able to wear it with a sweatshirt on a 40+ degree day and be warm.
4,Not Greatest or Greatest Hits BUT a GREAT SOUND,"I apreciate the first reviewer's take that this compilation, from the growing series of ""greatest songs"" for various countries, regions and styles, is not the big of the big or the best of the best. The name-brand names aren't showing off here, but I like the mellower confidence of this collection, sort of as if some relaxed Africans sauntered down to Ipanema and got a bit of Brazil in their groove. So throw the ""greatest"" subtitle out, and enjoy this admittedly consistent sound. It's sort of Africa meets ""Chill."" It's the softer side of Africa, the lighter side of the dark continent, but nothing here is unpleasant or undeserving of wider recognition. I am very happy with this CD, even if it may be better as semi-background music than boom it concert music. It may not be the ""greatest"" of anything, but for those of you/us who are hungry for fine African sounds, I'll bet you'll be pleased."
2,Try track number 3 (N'Zoutio),"I've only heard one track on TV and I was impressed so I wanna hear the whole album, maybe the rating can go up to five"
1,don't buy this,"Yes, the smell is nice, but that's about it -- the product is horrible. I have a hard time believing that anyone used this with successful results (I call B.S. on some of those reviews). I have normal skin type and after using this product for 1 week my face was in pain. There is way too much Retinol & Salicylic acid (acne drying agents) in the formula -- trust me, this will over-dry your skin. If you have severely acneic skin you may like this, but for everyone else this will wreck your face. I will say, the aftershave lotion Billy Jealousy produces is nice, but the Bar None face wash is absolute GARBAGE."
2,runny and dissapointing,really dissapointed. i bought the shaving cream which is great but felt let down after this purchase first of all when first opened all the soap spilled right out because like water not visous enough. then with what remained did not kkep bumps or pimples awa and did not improve my shaving experience. not the quality i expected.
2,nice smell but not a good cleanser,"I don't think this cleanser works particularly well -- if anything, since using it, my otherwise clear skin has *become* troubled. Perhaps it's a formula that only works for men, or only works on sensitive skin -- I have combination skin and am a girl, but after reading top reviews here decided to give it a try. Wasn't for me, although I really like the smell of this product."
4,works well,"First, the supplied power management software doesn't work on OS X. Is it really that difficult? No, it's lazy.Next, after being powered ON for 24+ hours, the unit failed to immediately switch to battery during a power failure. My area was experiencing power problems... after the 2nd or 3rd failure to switch I called Tripp Lite tech support. They were very easy to contact (on a relative scale). We looked at the issue. It had switched properly once during the few failures. We decidfed to give it break in time, which worked. After a few days, the UPS began switching reliably during failures.Lastly, tech support was USa, but the unit was made in China. This country is doomed if we can't start making more things here."
4,Head light to see,"Verry nice head light, looks verry close to original. Looks great. Now I need to purchase one for the right side. I would recommend to my friends to buy this product."
1,The author could have made a much better case....,"I sympathize with Mr. Davis's wish to adhere to the Seven Laws of Noah and live an ethical life. I too am trying to do that. But his book reminded me of two other books I read: ""Dancing Alone"" by Frank Schaeffer, which describes the author's journey from Evangelical Christianity into Eastern Orthodoxy, and ""The People's Padre"" by Emmett McLoughlin, which describes that author's exit from the Catholic priesthood seemingly into agnosticism. All of these books are very self-serving and self-righteous, showing the authors in the best possible light while ridiculing those members of the groups they left. Also, Mr. Davis in his book praises Meir Kahane, the founder of the Jewish Defense League, who was in my opinion a pretty horrible person. That lowered his credibility with me to almost zero. The book has some passing interest for those interested in the Noahite movement, but I found it a pain to get through."
2,Interesting but flawed,"J. David Davis' books presents an interesting chronicle -- the journey of one man (and several of his family and friends) from Christianity to the laws in Judaism that applies to non-Jews.The topic is interesting, but the presentation leaves much to be desired. Davis' tone is very self-important and he uses exclamation points so often that the narrative reads like a 6th grade girl's diary for the most part.A more mature and readable treatment of the topic is waiting to be done...."
4,p funk anti p funk whatever still freaking slams,project put out by parlet bassit donnie streling not a bad cd if you like 80's synth funk a genre p funk created starting with flashlight but I say bernie predated it on tales of kidd funkadelic funkfans search that album and decide for yourself anyway this is a good album abnd gets another plus for having long time p funk axeplayer michael hampton on here so yes this is a project for sertious p funk collectors who gotta have that funk.
4,"First novel in the ""Flynn"" series","This is the first novel featuring ""Francis Xavier Flynn,"" a Boston police inspector who investigates some most unusual cases. This novel is typical Gregory McDonald, fast paced, often funny and a good mystery. Fans of his ""Fletch"" series, in particular, should enjoy it."
2,FUN but not for little kids,"My 2 year old recieved this as a birthday gift since she is really into playing with baby dolls. She has the graco carseat and strollers which are great. But this high chair is very CHEAP, and I'm not just talking about the price. There is no way that she could take the tray off and put it back on, even I have trouble doing that. The back keeps falling off (the seat is actually 2 pieces, the back of the chair snaps on) and the leg design makes this toy very flimsy.She does enjoy playing with it still, but I definately would have shoped around for a better, sturdier play highchair. I have seen some wooden chairs for about $10 more. In my opinion it would have been worth it."
5,I keep coming back to it,"This is a great DVD with 2 intense workouts. I've had it for almost 3 years now, and I keep making my way back to it every 6-8 months. I would call myself an intermediate to advanced exerciser - I've done P90x (mostly through modifying moves), and I've done Insanity twice. Every time I finish really intense programs like those I want a break for a few weeks and I'll alternate between level three of Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred and this DVD. 30 Day Shred is always a welcome break, but no matter how in shape I think I am this DVD kicks my butt - that is really saying something about the effectiveness."
3,Decent Workout,"First up, I want to clarify that I'm a guy so I'm not really looking for a straight up cardio workout like this. But this dvd is good for fat burning for sure. Just a warning though. This is not for beginners. I exercise regularly so I figured this would be a piece of cake. Not really.....This is a definate advanced workout. Still though, worth picking up."
5,Great Workout!,This is a wonderful well rounded workout DVD. This is now one of my favorites. I like to combine cardio and weights to keep my heart rate up and this does a great job of that. Both the upper body and lower body segments are well rounded to work a good combinations and the cardio segments are challenging. I would say I am an advanced level of fitness and this fits in great to my workout routine.
3,Still the same old body...just a little tighter,I liked this DVD and the workouts. I did what I could within my abilities (I have MS). The pacing of the exercises was great and I like the fact that I didn't have to use a lot of floor space to perform them. I didn't follow the diet -- too much expensive food for our budget. My energy level has increased and my muscle tone is a bit better. I think it is worth the price.
4,I don't know about 10 days - but still a good video!,"I didn't notice much of a change in my body after 10 days. I was following the diet in the pamphlet which was really simple (and obvious - low calorie, leaning towards higher proteins but still relatively balanced.)The workouts are good - I really like the pace, the ease of the workouts and the instructor actually sweats which makes me feel better about how much I'm sweating.The only thing I wasn't prepared for was the equipment used - I have weights but there are some exercises that require using the weights to prop yourself up off the floor - easy enough to modify, but my weights are shaped funny and don't allow me to use them in the same way.Overall, I enjoyed the video, the workout and the recommend diet (although I was very hungry still and it took a lot of time to prep.) I didn't notice any drastic changes in my body, but it was a nice change of pace from my regular work out schedule."
3,Not too bad,This DVD has two different workouts that run about a half-hour each. Thefirst part is weight training combined with cardio moves. The second isfor chest and abs and gives a good workout to tighten the tummy area.There's also a meal plan with this DVD that has a 10 day plan of mealsand snacks to help trim calories. This DVD is probably useful forbeginner to intermediate people.
4,"Simple, effective workout","I really love the upper body workout, the lower body one is okay, but there are a couple of moves that are hard on my knees. She recommends a light (3-5 lbs) and heavy (8-10 lbs) set of weights for the workouts. There is a warm up, followed by alternating one minute circuits of strength and cardio. Cindy is excellent at cueing, and I love that. The only thing I dislike about the workout is the very rushed cool down. My heart rate is still really high from the last cardio move, and then I get rushed through a quick 2 minute cool down. I just do my own cool down. But I can still get in a decent workout in a short amount of time."
3,more intensity,"This video was okay. The upper body segment really didnt start getting tough until the end of the workout(it started to get very tough actually) and that's why I gave it 3 stars. The lower body workout bored me after the first 10-15mtes. Unlike the upper body, it is very easy to fatigue the legs. I thought after the first few exercises, my legs would be tired but they weren't; and its not because I am super advanced either. It was like she wanted to give a hard workout, but it lacked intensity; which was disappointing becuase cindy whitmarsh is usually very challenging."
5,Amazing workout... as challenging as Jillian Micheals.,"I've been doing the ""30-day shred"" daily in the morning and ""boost metabolis"" by Micheals at night so i thought this would be easy..not so.I LOVE it. This the first time a workout made by buns ache.(not just legs)And I LOVE how my arms look using the 8 pound weights recommended. The instructor is great. No frills, only the instructor. Now I do this every other evening instead of the ""boost metabolism"" Highly recommend!"
5,Great Training,"This DVD is a great one for working out with two routines designed for your upper and lower body with intervals for strength and cardio so you are able to get both happening in one workout and the back and forth works well so you do not get too tired with the cardio.I would consider myself a beginner still at this point so the modifications and lighter weights work well for me right now, but even then I feel like I am getting very good workouts.Cindy is a very good instructor and makes the workout go by quickly."
2,Same Old Stuff,"10 Days to a Better Body is like every other fitness/cadio DVD you've seen...a lot of prancing around, some low impact faux martial arts jabs, and light weight lifting exercises that look good but do little to actually build muscle.The main problem I have with the video is that it gives the false impression that a toned, fit body can be developed by pushing around 2.5 pound dumbbells. This is extremely misleading. Muscle can only be built by progressively harder resistance training.If you are looking for a quality, lower impact cardio workout, this DVD does a moderate job. But will this video change your body in 10 days? No...the title is simply a nice marketing ploy.One final note...the weight training exercises are often performed with such bad form (bouncing with squats, standing nearly prone with dumbbell rows) that they negate some of the DVDs credibility."
3,Ehhh another attempt at quick fix,"This DVD shows you how in 10 days you can have a better body, but you won't have the dvd cover body in 10 days so my advice is be willing to put in the work. Not a bad dvd though."
1,Good for experienced - not for beginners,"This is an acceptable exercise video for people who are already in good condition. If you are used to working out (Body Blast, aerobics w/ light weights, etc) then this is a good DVD to have. If you miss a class, or just need an extra workout, this is good.If you are NOT in good shape, skip this DVD. There are a lot of high impact moves here, and many exercises in this DVD are not good for beginners or those who are not in good shape.The weight loss plan attached is basic and well-planned. It is in a small booklet enclosed with the DVD."
1,OK...I realize this isn't very nice!,"OK, I hate to be the one to say this but it is just how I feel. When I am watching an exercise video I want to be watching someone that I would love to have her body. I want to believe that if I keep with this video that my body will look the same way. That is way I didn't get past the first five minutes with this workout DVD. The instructor is NOT the girl pictured on the front of the cover. The instructor has a really cute face, and the body of a sixteen year old boy. Honestly, she wasn't feminine at all with any curves or lean muscle. It was bizarre to watch, it looked like you put a girl's head on top of a high school boy's body, there was a complete disconnect. I can't comment on the quality of the exercises because once she started doing the rowing exercises 5 minutes into it I was so grossed out I had to turn it off and switch to another DVD. I would definitely pass on this DVD, there are too many wonderful one's out there to waste your time on this."
5,"Still effective, even with modifications.","I bought this video based on the previous reviews and am not dissatisfied. I cannot do everything the instructor can, as I am an ""intermediate level"" 55 year old with shoulder issues. So I have to be careful to remember to MODIFY anything involving shoulders. No regular pushups, little weight above the shoulder, etc. I like the way I can get a good upper or lower body workout WITH CARDIO in just thirty minutes. However, when I have more time, I prefer the more mellow Karen Voight workouts (Lean Legs and Buns; Firm Arms and Abs)which give me more warm-up and cool-down time, feel less rushed, and have better music (but no cardio). I follow those with a brisk walk or cardio video/dvd. They're all good choices. You can preview and read more reviews about many exercise videos on [...]. It's worth the investment of time."
4,"Good Workout, May be a little Heavy for Beginners","At home workout DVD's and home workout equipment or regimes of any kind are hard to follow. If you already have a moderate or regular workout plan in action you will enjoy this DVD. It's balanced for cardio and flexibility, and includes two workouts, one for upper, one for lower body. I'm a fan of working the total body so this wasn't really for me, and I also think it is tailored more for women in general. It IS a good workout though, you will sweat and be blowing hard by the end of it, so if you are an average couch potato looking for a quick fix, this will probably be too much, too soon.The cover pictures and claims on these discs always make me smile, and are pretty shameless with a bikini clad beauty, and the promise to lose 8 ponds in bold print. Results are possible, but please, be a little more subtle. 4 stars overall"
3,Seattle Symphony Gershwin collection,"An odd catch-all kind of disc. Performances are good enough---though many others as good are available. The Gershwin ""Catfish Row"" Porgy and Bess suite is odd indeed, with the ""environmental sounds"" running throughout the entirety of the music and even the usually-silent bands between the five movements. One hears rumbling, quiet and distant storms, bugs chirping, feet splashing through puddles, that sort of thing. If you find this soothing--wonderful. If you're interested in the music, primarily, I'd say get another recording of this."
5,works for small blocks of cheese,"This is great slicer for small blocks only. It will not cut a standard 5 pound loaf of cheese (4x4 slice) unless you push the cheese through the wire vertically instead of bringing the wire down on it.It is very heavy and makes cutting a block of cheese pretty effortless - much better than the handheld wire and roller style.To store the extra wires, I unscrewed the handle and pushed the wires down each end of the metal arm.Great value!"
4,Nice product!,"This is a very useful product if you serve and/or consume a lot of block style cheese. The wire cuts a nice, unmutilated piece of cheese in any size that is desired from extremely thin to extra thick. Not sure how it will work on the smoked cheese that comes with the wax wrap, but intend to try this out soon. Seems to work on hard and softer cheese with equal ease. Sure beats using knives!Clean up is quick and easy with the marble base and the nonskid protectors are a nice feature.The only issue I have is that the marble corners are imperfect and it looks as if they were hit and damaged at some point. They were chipped --a quality control issue??? Perhaps some cornice or steel plates affixed to these corners would protect the marble from that.It will be interesting to see how long the wire remains sharp, but it's nice that it comes with two extra ones! I hope this has a long life in my kitchen."
5,Slices the Competition,"After trying ahand slicer, getting sweaty doing so, and cutting my thumb--it was time to take a different approach.This slicer cuts cheese like magic with little to no physical effort required. What a relief from trying to cut up those giant blocks of cheese from Costco with a knife or hand slicer.After you create your first stack of slices, the slicer has no problem cutting back through the stack to make halves or quarters, whatever your preference.It looks nice and is heavier than expected. And for eight bucks, you really can't go wrong here.Unlike some other reviewers, my slicer and wire came intact, ready to go out-of-the-box, with the two replacements attached to the bottom."
4,Very nice,"Love this cheese slicer. It cuts all the way through the hardest cheese with ease, which is the best feature compared to other slicers I've owned. The only downfall is that the cheese slides while I'm slicing it so I place it on a piece of chhesecloth. Otherwise, I'm very pleased with it."
4,Great for the price,We were using all varieties of cheese knives for a while but the same result would be the cheese would stick to the knife. We love cheese and crackers as a snack and for while we are making dinner so that is why I decided to buy this product. It works very well for what is is and it comes with extra wires taped to the back. I am very happy that we purchased it. Make sure you hand wash and use something with brissles for the groove that the wire goes into to clean the cheese from it. Overall very satisfied thus far.
4,marble cheese slicer by fox run,very nice cheese slicer works very well and it came with two replacement cuting wires
1,Unhappy,"Bought this as a gift and was unhappy with the quality as well as the fact that the marble was chipped. Plus the wire was ""cheesy"" and did not seem like it would be effective. Should have taken the negative reviews to heart."
1,Not happy with this product,Received this today and the wire was broken. I found two replacement wires taped underneath but couldn't figure out how to replace them and the wires seem too long for the item. Not worth my time trying to figure it out. I am returning item.
1,Not every cheese works,"So I bought this cheese slicer since my hobby is basically to try new foods and find new and exotic ways to slice them. Sadly this product doesn't come with a warning that it can't slice every cheese. Cheddar slices extremely well, for instance....however bleu cheese just crumbles it seems. Don't even try cottage cheese, as the results are entirely lackluster.Bonus: Can slice vegetables and cured meats, even though it doesn't suggest to do such on the package. Though I would strongly advise people to buy a vegetable or cured meat slicer instead as one doesn't know what ill effects the cheese slicer has with such products, for if a cheese slicer gets the taste for meat it can be quite dangerous."
2,Fox Marble Cheese Slicer,"I went to cut a piece of cheese and the wire immediately had broken. Placed the second wire on the slicer and it too had broken. Now, on the third and have not used it since."
5,Marble Cheese Slicer,The cheese slicer is exactly what was advertised. Sent along with it were two (2) additional replacement 'wires' or 'slicers' to be used in the event of future breakage. If you don't mind paying for the shipping (marble is heavy) you will have a great slicer. Shipment was promptly sent and the merchandise well packed to avoid any damage.
3,"Not bad, for the price...","Product isn't too bad for the price, but it arrived with chips around the corners of the marble. Seems cheap, maybe that's because it was. For 8 bucks, not bad."
1,Pretty is as pretty does.,"It's a very pretty block of marble. Unfortunately, it's not a very good cheese slicer. The wire is too thin and too loose and seems fragile. It works best at edge of the table so the handle can be lowered past the base while cutting. At lease, it's not very expensive."
3,small and easy to store,The cheese cutter on the marble slicer arrived on time. It was not that easy to assemble the string since it required a little of assembly.
5,Great Gift!,Fox Run Marble Cheese SlicerBought 4 of this item as Christmas gifts and was very pleased with them. The marble tray is beautiful--very clean looking. I have used my own cheese slicer for over 30 years and it is still in good working order. This model came with two extra wires. It slices all kinds of cheese--hard and soft. I wouldn't be without it.
5,Great cheese slicer,Works great! Came with a few extra wires in case one snaps during use or storage. Sturdy and durable. A great purchase for the money
4,Not sure how I feel about this one,"I rated ours a 4 star. When it arrived in the mail, the qire already attached was broken, so already, we had to use a replacement one. But since having to put the new wire on, it doesn't work properly, can't get it to stay tight so I can cut cheese. I wanted this exact one because my grandmother had this one and we used it for many many years and thought this would be the best one for my own home and family. Just wish the wire would stay on there right so its not a pain to use!"
4,Buy it,One of the best basic products ever. The feet come off but you can hot glue them back on and good as new.
4,"OK for dishwasher, need to re-glue the feet","A nice heavy little cheeseslicer, but cheaply made. The weight keeps it from sliding around and you can chill it; it will stay cool a long time. They use a very cheap glue for the feet, so you will need to re-glue them with a strong glue when they come off. Once I reglued the feet with a good waterproof glue, I have never had to do it again. The wire is not strong enough to cut really hard cheeses like Parmesean; no wire type slicer is. The wire will eventually break. There should be a replacement wire taped to the bottom. It is slightly difficult to replace. You can get additional replacement wires off the internet for about a dollar including shipping; I seem to have lost track of the link but I have done it.Dishwasher safe once you reglue the feet."
2,Poor function,"marble with hard ""feet"" - can easily damage our soapstone countertops unless cork or felt is put under it.the wire does not tension well and gets too slack and doesn't cut heavier cheeses well.We had a cheapie wood cheese cutter for 10 years that worked great but finally broke. My wife bought this one because it looked nice, but function wise it's not a good value. We'll probably replace it soon."
2,Cheese Cutter,I ordered this item twice and both times it came with a broken wire. I know that it is an inexpensive item but come-on worth packing with care.
5,Good chese slicer with bad packing,"This is a good, very good cheese slicer that is getting a bad rap because it isn't packaged carefully enough. I bought 4 (buying early Christmas gifts) and got the ""4 for 3"" deal - buy 4, get 1 free - and 2 came with wires broken on them. I simply went online, requested replacements and mailed the 2 broken units back free.I can't knock a good product at a good price because the factory (not Amazon) packing is bad."
3,The cutting wire was broken upon receiving the product.,The cutting wire was broken upon receiving the product. Very disappointing. However I was able to replace the broken wire with the additional spare wire easily. Then no problem since.
3,Wobbly lever action,"Looks good. The wire cutter is not fixed securely to the marble block which results in a wobbly, uneven cutting line. Sometimes the wire does not come down into the groove thereby not cutting the cheese block completely through. The cheese block must be positioned as close to the top edge of the marble block as the wire cutter will allow for a smoother cut but still not the best. If you want to take your time and guide the wire slowly with every slice then this is ok. It was cheap and it does slice and there are two replacement wires."
2,Great until pedals strip out of cranks,"Great Unicycle, until the pedals strip out of the cranks! Made in China, probably with inferior metal forged cranks. When the pedals start flopping around your done for! I had a lot of fun riding it, then the pedals started flopping around. I tried tightening them but they were stripped out already. They hadn't backed out or come unscrewed the threads just busted/stripped out. I'm really bummed!!!"
3,not what I expected,"Its not as big as I was expecting. You cant put your keys in it, but could put single keys. I put cash and credit cards in it. Thats all that would fit. It has a plastic clasp to hold the string together, if you dont tie it in a knot, then it will come apart. I would NOT trust the clasp, it pulls apart so easily."
5,Victorinox 48042 Cutlery 3-Piece Paring Knife Set,This is my third Pulsar Sports Watch. I particularly like this model due to the glow in the dark hands.
3,poorly translated,"While the Chinese character used here can be translated to mean ""peace"" or ""harmony"", that is not the character commonly used by the Chinese people. The character for ""peace"" that you usually see in China looks more like these:Sterling Silver Chinese Character for ""PEACE"" Pendant, 1"" (25mm) Tall.Sterling Silver and Leather Chinese Character Pendant"
5,I LOVE IT,"This is a much needed product, I am happy to have purchased it at a great price. Thank you very much!"
1,Biased writing for Children,"If you like liberal biasing, you will like Mary Rose. I personally do not and couldn't stand her page on Columbus and the Arawak Indians. Here are some examples:Described Columbus' clothes as outlandishThe Indians taught Columbus how to extract poison. Nothing on what the Europeans taught the Indians.The Indians made cones for 100 people, Columbus' ships only 40. The author left out all of the provisions and at that time Europeans had ships that held over 1300 people.Canoes could go a ""good speed."" How about the sailboats?The Indians settled their problems playing a game. Implying that the Europeans only fought. She must have forgotten about the wars between Indians and the judicial system in Europe (as well as wars).The Indians didn't have metal items such as knives and guns. Was that all the Europeans used metal for? How about plows for the past 3000 years?Her writing is nothing more than an apology. Very shameful writing geared toward children."
1,One star is too good,"I am a big Sylvia fan but she should stick to writing about subjects that she has knowledge of. There is so much more to astrology than this and this book certainly will do nothing to educate people about a very complex science. If this book was written to amuse, I am not laughing. But then again, what would I know? I am a Taurus, so therefore I am stupid, boring and I stalk my former lovers. Save your money on this one!"
2,Be careful,"She may be a psychic, but she misses on some basic fundamentals of astrology, like knowing the elements of each Sun Sign. . . Not for serious students of astrology."
4,Comedic Look at Astrology from a Well-Known & Loved Psychic,"I am going to repeat a previous reviewer's words: this book is meant to be ""light hearted"". If you are serious about astrology, then this book is NOT for you!! This book simply touches on characteristics of the astrological signs, mainly from Sylvia's own personal experiences with them. I found most of what Sylvia said to be not only true, but often times hilarious. I shared this book with friends, and no one was disappointed. This book is truly written in Sylvia's style (blunt, to the point) and not everyone likes that. If you are a true Sylvia Brown fan, I recommend that you read this book. The only problem I had with this book was that it was too short!"
4,Easy Reading!,I gave this book 4 stars in stead of 5 because I thought Sylvia would teach a little bit about how Astrology works but really it was more about characteristcs of the sun signs. The book is really small and I read it in an hour and a half but all in all it was a good book and I did enjoy it. It isn't as good as her other books that are more spiritual but I would recommend it to someone who just wants the characteristics of each sign. God Bless! :o)
2,"Sylvia, stick to what you know","Sylvia's other books have helped contribute to understanding the intuitive world. But here, she strays into territory she'd do better leaving to professional astrologers. It's books like these (not even on a par with a good beginner book written by a practicing astrologer) that mislead people about what kind of information is available to them through the use of astrology. Astrology can offer a breath and depth of information and insight that is staggering. You're not going to find either depth or breath in this book."
1,Very poor False information,"I was very disappointed in this book. I did not see the humor that she spoke of and I feel that she is way off base in her information for the different signs. Personally I feel it was a big waste of money. I read all of her books, but this one is for the birds."
4,Don't be so harsh...,"I can't understand why others are so down on this book! Sure, it's not necessarily the most informative, or accurate even, book on astrology ever, but that's the fun of it. I doubt that anyone interested in the ""serious"" study of astrology would even be interested in this little book, with it's sun-sign only focus, and it's ""pretty"" pastel-type cover...but for the rest of us, and especially those of us who enjoy Sylvia's other work, it's a handy little guide, nothing more, nothing less. I personally felt that she hit some of the signs dead-on, especially Cancer and Virgo...and the other's weren't too far off either. So basically, if you're looking for a book to learn from, try something else. Don't go in expecting too much, however, and you'll probably get a good laugh, and maybe even learn a thing or two from the book."
1,This was horrible!,"What does a psychic know about astrology? Nothing! I did not find this amusing or informative. Half the things she said about my sign did not apply to me, and the other half I found so vague, I felt like I was at a street fair being cheated out of my $2. It was a waste of my time and money."
3,Astrology Through A Psychics Eyes,"All of Sylvia's books have new and little known, never written information. If your looking for her usual(in depth) writing, this is not one."
1,a half a star would have been too much for this book!,"I think this woman is just way too full of herself. I love astrology and love most of the authors but she just grated on my nerves the entire time I was reading through this (which by the way didn't take long since this is a very small book.)Some parts I felt like I was reading gibberish, it made no sense at all, none of it fit anyone I knew! She came across as a pompous know-it-all. A waste of my time and probably yours if you are unlucky enough to have this book on your TBR list.AND if I could of given this a half-star rating well...that would of been too much for it too!"
5,One of the best cds i have ever heard.,"This is a really good cd. It has many people in it. If you are into the crazy lyrics of Eminem and D12, then you will love this cd, too. It had Bizzare from D12 on it, along with many other artists. Every track offers a new and different type of song and they all are crazy. It is for sure worth the money."
3,DJ Butter-Kill The DJ Mixtape,"This is a true masterpiece by DJ Butter,featuring D12's Bugz who got shot in 1999,these songs were recorded a month before his death.But this CD also features other D12members like:Eminem,Bizarre,Kon Artis & Proof.And the classic song Players by Slum Village.Enough said..this CD is a true collector's item!!"
5,Just what I needed for ebony wood,"Looked around for this for a long time, and when I purchased it the shipping time was very fast. Did a great job when I required perfection. Used it at around 27k RPM with no problems. Glad I found Southeast through Amazon - cheaper than ordering through the company's website!"
3,A good movie with holes,"The movie is good, but it has holes and leaves viewers wondering what happened. Makes a good point of seeing a different view of illegal aliens."
2,Adorable but not very durable...,"This bag is adorable. I purchased it for my daughter from Anne Geddes.com before Babies R Us was even selling it. It has a bottle holder, changing pad, and pocket to keep the changing pad in. Although, it is cute, I wouldn't purchase another one. It's not washable, except for wiping it. The leather on the bottom wears easily and discolors. Also, the material around where the straps attach to the bag frayed. Beautiful, but it doesn't stand up to the everyday tasks of a new mom and baby, and not worth the money."
1,old and error ridden,"I bought this book to get myself back up to speed on mathematics before I returned to college. The book is obviously from the 50's in it style and language which makes it rather hard to understand. Several of the section, particularly the ones on calculus are riddled with errors. Since the same errors are repeated multiple times in several chapters I can only conclude that these come from the author and not the editors.I found that between the style and the numerous errors that this book was almost wotrthless since I felt that everything it said had to be checked in another better book."
5,A Master Covered by a Master,Mark Murphy covers well-known as well as rare material made by Nat Cole. Delicious to perceive two personalities and approaches to singing which are so completely different and so deeply powerful. This is another gem by Murphy from the Muse Records files. This is a 2-CD pack!
4,Balance Pad,Like most exercise products you have to use it to get any benefits. I used the balance Pad abt.10 min a day towork on my stability after knee surgery.
5,Attention lovers of old school funk!,Would definitely recommend for anyone to add to their old school collection! THIS IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE OLD SCHOOL CD'S!!!!!
3,Full of songs,"I was a little disappointed initially as I expected a story, instead this dvd is full of songs. My daughter enjoys it and has picked up a song or two. Overall- good."
4,GM good,Follows the Russian school method of critical positions to remember and aim for. A great study book for the average to advance player.
1,Did not fit correctly,"I hoped these would be an improvement over my current riding glasses, but sadly they were not. The product did not fit me correctly due to the bridge area being far too narrow, and the glasses made to fit a wider face. This also made the foam ineffective due to not being close enough to my face to keep sand and other debris out of my eyes while riding. This purchase was not a total loss as I heavily modified the glasses with a dremel tool to correct the bridge problem, and heated the middle in order to bend the glasses inward slightly for a decent fit. Unlike other reviewers my strap snaps in and locks tightly, however I did not find it comfortable because it either pushed my ears outwards, or smashed them depending on which side of the ear I placed the strap. I would not buy these again."
5,Best dance version of the two available,Love the keyboard take on the choir voices. Great dance mix and by far superior over the Wasabees dance mix. Highly recommended if you are a Star Wars fan.
2,Avoid unless your looking for a dance re-mix,"I expected this thing to be an extended version of Williams' classic from the new movie. All I got for my efforts was a 'techno' beat with samples from the original score. Some people may like it, but I was sorely disappointed. There should be a listening sample on the purchase screen so that persons like me will spend their money on something they can better appreciate."
4,Why is this not yet on DVD?????,"I really enjoyed this movie and have been long-awaiting it on DVD to replace my aging VHS copy. Unlike so many movies, this one just ain't predictable. It's nail-biting and very authentic looking. Shouldn't there be a forum here for older movies overdue for the DVD treatment???"
2,Twilight's Last Gleaming,"Burt and Richard are two of my favorite actor's but in this picture, the quality seemed low for their talents. It seemed the directing was not on a high level as most of their other movies I have viewed. The picture clarity was low also. ETL"
2,Weird,"This is an odd film. Loosely -- and I do mean LOOSELY -- based on Walter Wager's novel VIPER THREE, Burt Lancaster plays an embittered ex-officer who, along with several others, seizes a misille flight, demanding the military admit the real reason for the Vietnam war. Note worthy only because of a brief appearence of William Smith as a really crazed nut."
1,Nonviwable,"I got this item only to be able to Not view it!! I start it playing, only to have it stop and then shut off the player. What do I do now?"
4,BEST ANTI-VIETNAM FILM OF THEM ALL,Burt Lancaster is fabulous and what a cast!! This is really well done and moves so fast!! I love Charles Durning butwould not have cast him as the President!! Still works well and what an Anti-Vitenam film!!! Picture and Sound arevery good!!! A good oldie..especially if U love Burt!!!
4,where the H__ is the DVD?,"I remember this movie from when I was a kid and started following the past (and future) career of Burt Lancaster because of it. I notice alot of his older movies coming out on dvd recently...where the H is this one? Who's arm in Hollywood do you have to twist to get quality entertainment like this out on dvd? I do remember seeing it released years ago on laserdisc. Great movie, great suspense with great (and plausible) ending."
5,Twilight's Last Gleaming,"One of the best Cold War (fictional) stories of it's time. Too bad that the US studios haven't released it here yet. Thank God there's a few legal copies available from off shore entities. Thanks, Amazon."
5,Delcious,"I enjoyed eating this Mocha Roca!!! It tasted like coffee and I lVe the almonds on top!! Beautiful crunchy flavor that I can,t resist!!! I have Tobit another one again!!! delicious!!!!"
4,A good beginning to understanding them,"I was researching pedophilia when I came upon this book and I'm so glad I had the chance to read it now. It really opened my eyes regarding pedophiles and the goings on within their minds. It also gave me a firmer understanding of possible reform programs for these offenders. Most of all, it ensured me that not nearly enough time and study has gone into the understanding of these people as a solution to the problem. Are pedophiles around every corner as our media would have us believe? No. Do they exist and are they a concern in modern day society? Yes. The point is that only by trying to understand why they do what they do can we begin to keep tragic events from taking place and ruining families and lives across this country. Being outraged and executing them without studying them thoroughly is not the answer people."
4,Very Sexy :O,This is definitely a must have male model calendar of the season. You don't know what you're missing until it shows up in the mail
4,Motivate yourself to avoid surgery,"Easy read, casual style, poorly edited. If your doctor is recommending the KNIFE for your prostate problem: read this book FIRST! If you are willing to buck the system to save ""the boys"", this book may give you the motivation and direction to do so. Eric does a bit too much gazing into his own belly button, but it is amusing and may help you to see in yourself some of the weaknesses that have contributed to your problems and some of the strengths that will help you overcome them. This book is probably NOT a read for most women. If you are interested primarily in the PEPOLE personality profile system, I would suggest trying to get a copy of ""The Velvet Glove"" even though it is out of print."
3,A Guide Book of United States Coins 2003 Red Book,"While this book is a basic text for the beginner to moderatly advanced coin collector the editors have continued to be lax in keeping the book up to date. Failure to include photos of modern commerative coins from mid 1998 to present is inexcusable. Aditionally only the 1999 Statehood quarters are illustrated. Photos of coins, especially popular modern collectibles, are critical to the usefulness of the book. It seems that the book is minimally updated every year, a dissapointment."
4,A little bit deeper in the world of US coins,"As I told in an other review regarding the blue book of US coins, I'm very intersted in the coins and their history; the red book is an exploitation in that world."
4,Timely information,"As another reviewer pointed out, I to was dissapointed by the fact that the latest commerative coins were not included. At first, I thought since these are not very valuable they were excluded. Next, I thought these are the precise coins that new beginners would be looking for when they bought this book. But in conclusion, I think the real problem is timelyness. Each edition is just plain not too timely. That's a shame since time is both knowledge and the advantage one needs to stay on top of the market. This book is not meant to be a history book of the past. I hope the editors get the picture expressed here."
4,the beginning of something groundbreaking,"Morrison is one of the gods of comic book writing, and you can see why with the animal man series. The story is great and only hints at what is to come. And I can't wait to get ahold of the next two books. The art was a little disappointing though."
4,Vintage Grant Morrison,"This book starts as an above average story of a second rate superhero, but what makes this book really special is the reprint of 'The Coyote Gospel', probably the best single issue story I have ever read, and a thinly disguised tribute to the great downtrodden Wile E Coyote of Roadrunner fame. After buying this book, seek out the remaining 18 or so issues of Animal Man that Grant Morrison did, which challenge the reality of Animal Man's world and are in my opinion Grant Morrison's best work to date."
4,Read Whole Run... It Gets Better With Each Episode,"I bought the entire run at Amazon, and I suggest you do the same, 'cause stories are very conected, but read the other two volumes also because they're simply better. Fun and original... Like Grant always is."
2,Low-quality reprint,"The stories in this volume are classics, one of the best modern rebirths of a superhero, but the format of the collection isn't of the same quality. The printing and paper quality are perhaps a step down from the original single issues, and are certainly no upgrade from those. One of Bollands ugliest paintings has been chosen for the cover, and there are no extras to speak of. The interior title and intro pages feature animals prints in clashing neon tones. I would prefer to may more for a finer version, as I believe Animal Man deserves better than this."
2,Average at Best,"Being a comic book fan, I constantly heard great things about Morrison's Animal Man run but it was really plain. except for the current Mirror Master debuting, the issues fail to get any emotion out of me."
2,Too many typos - detail not bad at intermediate level.,"This should probably be a 2.5 star rating but they don't allow non-integer ratings. Basically, while the conceptual material regarding hedging of credit derivatives is quite good, there are far too many typo's throughout the book - often where a perhaps less experienced reader will not pick them up (both in text and formulae). Also, while there is a wealth of material concerning basic and intermediate practical issues, the detail peters out just when the most practical issues are raised - such as delta hedging of credit derivatives by maturity buckets rather than with a single maturity CDS. Still, I did find elements of it useful and some concepts that I had not come across before."
3,"Good topics, lousy writing","The topics covered in this book are very good. However, the writing is really lousy. One can get a headache from reading this book.Can anyone understand what a ""percentile"" is from this book?"
2,"Good facts, poorly edited...","While there are interesting facts to be gleaned from this book, it is way too disjointed to read comfortably. I literally got lost as I was reading more than a few times in the first couple of chapters alone, as the author jumps around without properly tying the disparate parts of a story into a cohesive narrative. I gave up trying to read the book in its natural order, and jumped around in search of points of interest.I get the sense that the author went back and forth while editing the book, and somehow got lost himself when he tried to add more sub-stories within each chapter. If there was no professional editor for this book, then that explains the quality of the final product.Final Analysis: It is very difficult to read, but some of the stories and facts are worth the price of the book. It's just too bad that the reader has to work so hard to find them."
4,Another great Rockstar Game,"If you are familar with the Rockstar games, then you know what to expect from this one - lots of action, good controls, entertaining graphics, interesting storyline, and vulgar dialogue. It follows the original movie fairly closely. There are lots of levels that are replayable and a few minigames. My only complaint is that there is almost too much fighting. It gets repetative eventhough you can use various objects as weapons. I would have liked to seen some different activities. But overall, a great game that puts you inside the movie."
4,Cult favorite about a cult favorite,This was a surprising find for me. I never even heard of the game before stumbling on the listing. There is a lot to like about the game play and design. Sometimes the colors are just too dark comfortably view in the daylight but it still works pretty well as a psp game.
4,The pure pleasure of pop music,"I was a nick lowe fan from the first time I heard him do, What's so funny about peace love and understanding? He has satire in his aproach to pop music and manages to keep the sugar of pop mixed with a liitle dose of dry humor to temper it. He plays with words like a great chef deals with spice. He adds enough to make it taste good but not too much to overpower it and let the taste come thru. Anyone who can spoof Castro and Hitler on the the same disc has the world view for breakfast. This disc is a trip thru the world of pop by a purveayor of purloined prose. Well worth your time to track down a copy."
5,COULD OF BEEN BETTER!,"THESE SONG'S ARE TIMELESS CLASSICS IN THE VOICE OF A TIMELESS MAN. ANTONIO AGUILAR IS TO BE CONSIDERED THE BEST IN HIS GENRE. BEFORE HIM THERE WAS NONE AND AFTER HIM THERE SHALL BE NO MORE. I BELEIVE THE RECORD COMPANY COULD OF, AND SHOULD OF CHOSEN OTHER SONG'S TO INCLUDE IN THIS COLLECTION OF HIT'S, SINCE THIS MAN RECORDED MORE THAN 190 ALBUM'S. YOU'D THINK THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN A BETTER SELECTION INSTEAD OF GIVING US SONG'S THAT WERE ALREADY ON THE MARKET IN OTHER COLLECTION'S. MY ADVISE FOR DISCOS MUSART/BALBOA RECORDS, NEXT TIME DO BETTER. MAKE IT UP TO US BY RELEASING SOME MORE OF HIS ORIGINAL MUSIC."
2,It is TINY,"This product appears to be much bigger in the picture and there is no indication of it being so small. I gave it as a gift so i cannot return it, but it was a sore disappointment....."
3,"I like it, but it is extremely elementary.","Buy this for the anecdotes. She is really funny, and I think she really might be insane. The recipes...not so much, but the stories are great."
1,Tasteless,"Good recipes, clever hints, but absolutely tasteless and tacky text.In an endeavor to be cute and witty, the author crosses the boundary ofwhat should be put in print."
1,not worth a dime....,"It is no-where close to what i expected...In short i would call it a ""overpriced book with worthless content""...unless you just want to pay for the cover I wouldn't recommend it at all..."
1,Nasty ignorant thoughts coming from a nasty ignorant woman,"So sad she is the sister of David and has been riding on his coat-tails for so long. At least his first two books were funny. This book is incredibly vulgar and poorly written. I'm surprised it was published at all. Just chock full of bigotry subtle and not so subtle. To see what I mean, search for Amy Sedaris and ""ching chong"". Let's do our part to make sure Amy Sedaris is headed back to the gutter where she belongs."
1,Don't waste your money,As the title says - don't waste your money on this book. I do not understand the humor in this book. I thought this was to be an entertaining and helpful book for persons interested in learning the art of hospitality. There is very little useful information in the book and the oddly inserted humor is distracting. The author has a thing about teeth (or one tooth)- I don't understand how this relates to the topic at hand. Also the pictures are from a different era and not inviting nor do they enhance the message. I find dirty recipe cards unappealing - I don't want to make the food when I have to look at a stained recipe card. The vagina information has no place in this type of book and detracts from the hospitality message. I really don't understand the purpose of putting it into this book. The book is not useful as an entertaining guide and not funny as a comedy piece.
5,wow a lotta book for the money,"The price stalled me for a bit but now that I have it, I think the price is a good deal because there is so much going on in the book. I had the exact same contact paper on my paper clip necklace. I didn't see a faux leather weave pencil cup made out of a baby food jar, masking tape and brown shoe polish in the book but there are a lot of reference photos of the author tanned and in tan pantyhose for those recipes that instruct food to be cooked until tanned. Also, if you tend to stare at photos of ethnic Greek women looking for similiarities and the inspiration for the nonstop creation of kourai, this is the book for you. Lots of pictures of the author especially her FEET with great photographic detail of her toes and toe nails."
5,The Hostess With The Mostess,"If you like parties - big parties, small parties or blanket parties, this book is for you. It offers everything that you need to host or attend a party. And then some. Learn how to cook popular dishes, make little crafts and be the perfect host/hostess/attendee.Even if you have no friends to invite to a party or no hope of ever being invited to one, you still ought to read this book because it will help lift the dark clouds of depression. Amy Sedaris is a very talented and gifted writer with a terrific sense of humor. Although I don't know her I am hoping to one day receive an invitation to somewhere she might be."
4,"Entertaining book, but may not be for everyone","Some of the previous negative reviews touched on the the following issues:A. The photography is garrish. The reader is reminded of all the reasons why the 60s/70s went out of style.B. Some of the food looks fake and/or inedible.C. There are references to drugs and sex that make a reader wonder, ""Is she for real??""D. There are many, many pictures of Amy throughout the book.E. The illustrations are pretty elementary.Having said all of those things, I still found the book to be entertaining and informative. Amy's quirky style works for me as well as her brother David's does. I did not buy the book on Amazon, rather I purchased it my friendly neighborhood independent book store. It took me three trips to the store to decide to purchase it after looking it over carefully. If the issues noted above are of concern to you, you might want to look at the book in person or skip this one altogether."
4,anti- Martha,I found the book to be fun to read and to share with others. Amy has a great sense of humor and we all need to learn to laugh at ourselves and our attempts at entertaining.
3,Not what I expected...,"This book is well illustrated and very funny. A few items are a bit on the obscene side of humor, but if that's what you're looking for it is done well. I expected a book that gave a quirky look at entertaining guests, and to some extent that is what was there. The book was ruined for me, though, by the frequent use of the word f**k, and the how-to section that explains, and illustrates, how to keep certain parts of the female anatomy clean enough to taste good. Funny in it's place, but if you're looking for something to put on the kitchen bookshelf - this may not be it."
3,Great pictures!,"I know Amy Sedaris said she didn't want this to be a joke cookbook, so all the recipes are real in it, but I couldn't believe how l-o-n-g this book is. Parts of it crack me up...especially the photo montage of her putting pantyhose on...that's exactly what it really looks like to have to put those torture devices on! But it just keeps going and going and going. I'd definitely check this book out of the library or borrow it from a friend, but I'm not sure it really needs to be part of my book collection."
3,I REALLY wanted to love it but . . .,"I am a big Sedaris family fan, and also have a modest collection of pre-Nixon era cookbooks and etiquette guides, so I was thrilled when my audio book arrived. While there are moments from the book that are terrific (pretty much all of disc 2), the rest of it was just not as twisted or original as I had hoped. I like my humor biting, pithy, even mildly disturbing, and generally the sort of thing that could get you fired at work. Some of the book made me laugh, but other sections contained long list after list, or advice for entertaining that was just too mundane to hold my interest (e.g. make sure you have plenty of ice, be sure to send information about parking on invitations etc.). Even with a section on vaginal maintenance, I just can't give it my top rating."
4,Surprisingly Sweet,"I found myself writing down some of the great tips Amy gives in the book and laughed myself silly at her suggestion on how to make money off of house guests. I loved the advertisements, pinapple tampons, anyone? So funny. The recipes looked pretty good too, especially if you like greek food."
5,Nostalgic Food Fun and Laughs,"Are you thinking of throwing a party like your parents or grandparents (depending on your age) used to? This is an utterly tongue in cheek nostalgic throwback to those days. Amy Sedaris' ironic wit is rather amusing, entertaining and a lot of fun. The book is actually quite useful with her unique perspective on preparations. Her engaging recipes and overall food, drink and party recommendations are humorously, side splitting at times, told with a genuine love for both food and fun! A great Christmas gift by far and I really love the cover."
4,Sick sense of humor,"Well if you or anyone one know, is considered to have a SICK sense of humor, your going to LOVE this book. It took someone with a warped sense of humor to write this book and the same to really enjoy it. I even got one for my wraped sister-in-law."
3,Ham and Cheese -,This book is a strange read - at many points I was having a very hard time telling if Sedaris was serious or just pulling the leg. The ongoing yard sale / money making opportunity at every party event is almost tempting. Especially having just come through another Xmas of gifts I've received that need to just go right back out the door. There are a number of soft spots in the book - and the look and feel of the photos and page layouts I studied for a long time. A nice fun way to pass a weekend.
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed when I received this book. The description said it was the hardcover version but neglected to mention that it was not the normal full size one with photos. The version I received was small & had no photos. I wish that I'd known more about the version of the book- I would not have ordered it had I known. Otherwise, the delivery was prompt & the book in good condition."
4,I love the Sedaris family but...,"This is a great book. Its 33% comedy and 50% cookbook 17% DIY crafts.Its slightly repetitive, comedy wise, but very inventive and fresh.You can feel Amy being ""Jerry"" occasionally.Which is a positive and a negative.I love the excerpts from Paul Dinello and ""The Rooster""I guess what I'm trying to say is, it's not what I expected.Please take into account the fact that I've read, and loved, almost all of David Sedairs' books.Long story short.I wanted more storys and less recipes.I pre-ordered this almost 1000 years ago and my anticipation probably played a part in my ""dissapointment"".I put quotes around dissapointment because I couldent think of a better word.I STILL REALLY LIKE THIS BOOK.And some of these recipes are REALLY good!I still, and always, love the ""Sedari"" in any media.My suggestion: Buy it, love it, use it."
5,I bought five books to give for Christmas presents this year.,"I found this hilarious book in the stack of reading material at my dear friend Linda's house (well, okay, it was in her bathroom) during one of our girl pal weekends in October. Her kids bought it for her last Christmas. I could not put it down since there was one outrageous, goofy picture and laugh inducing writing around every corner of the book! I suppose I was a little obnoxious carrying it around and reading it to the other friends gathered. The humor is not for everyone, but, for those of us who love to savor the funny in life, even when it's a little ugly - well, this book is for you! Like I said in my title, I'm practically handing out copies of this book this year to spread the cheer. Merry Christmas, Amy!"
5,a great deal of fun! very highly recommended.,"This is basically a book on cooking, hilarious ""crafts"" (all doable, but we're talking pantyhose planter holders here), and commentary on how to handle any characters that might show up for a bite or a drink. The recipes are range from the ice cream fantasy cakes of childhood to...comfort food, crazy food, and food to feed a crowd. If you don't like wonky humor, true stories and fuzzy logic, I'd advise getting a ""real"" cookbook. But if you're up to laugh a whole lot and get the urge to go and bake something for somebody, this is absolutely worth it.The production value on this thing is lovely, with a lovely 50's style green cover.Amy Sedaris is the best part of this book. But Paul Sedaris, better known as the Rooster, is the second best: Get the complete recipe of the ""F****-It Bucket"" as described in brother David's ""Me Talk Pretty One Day."""
5,"Run out and buy this book now! Or take the car, it's faster.",Brilliant! Exciting! Magical! I got my copy in the mail yesterday and haven't been able to take my eyes off it. There is so much information to absorb on every page it's like looking through a kaleidoscope on acid. I now know what I am getting everyone on my list for Christmas this year. No home should be without a copy.
4,Wow! This Is Good Stuff!,"Can you believe this book???? Practical, funny, creative, liberated, boy it just racks up positive adjectives, doesn't it? But be forewarned, it's also revoltingly gross here and there and above all this is comedy, not a foray too far into Martha Stewart territory. But then again, if you needed me to tell you that you probably don't know who Amy Sedaris is. I had fun reading Amy Sedaris' assault on vulnerable Eisenhower-era values, actually learned a thing or two, and, who knows, might try a few of her recipes next time I'm feeling antidisestablishmentalitarian. And, oh yeah, her, ahem, charming wit is amusing too. (Marbles in the medicine cabinet?! What to do with organic lemons? Where the heck does she get that stuff?) I'm a fan of books that walk the thin line between parody and information, offensive and endearing, and gods help us, the irreverent I Like You does that extremely well."
5,"As a former chef, I'm impressed......","and I wince and get queezy at the same time!! I love this book and I did find alot of good ideas for events I would'nt normally celebrate. Good, basic ""building block"" recipies that you can vary or do as instructed.Buy this book now!!"
4,Quirky but funny,"This book is a really quirky read. I went off of the reviews I read about it when I purchased it. It really kept me interested and had me giggling and laughing out loud in parts. It really is off the wall reading, but totally worth it. I really enjoyed reading it. Amy has a funky sense of humor and it really shines in this book."
4,Weird and Wacky World Of Amy Sedaris,"I have been a fan of Amy Sedaris since the early Strangers with Candy days. She is such a unique individual, in the strangest and wackiest sense. This book offers a further glimpse into her mind. Entertaining through the eyes of Amy Sedaris becomes an adventure. Myriads of tips will make you laugh out loud. For example, you should ""buy organic lemons,if for no other reason than because the puckered tips make great nipples to stuff in your bra."" She even provides ettiquette rules for the host/guest challenged. For example, a host should avoid several possible guest combinations, among them a ""director and out-of-work actor"" or a ""serial killer& drunken teeneager."" All that being said, this is not just a comedy book. There are tons of recipes and craft projects included, photgraphed in a wonderful seventies style. Buy It!"
5,Wanna see me get hilarious?,"This is so funny, I can't stop listening to it. It also really DOES have good tips as a hostess or partygoer. I love that you can hear Jerri Blank in Amy's voice every once in a while...."
4,Too hysterical,"Seriously, are there people more funny than the Sedaris'? Just like her brother David, Amy has whipped up a fantastic book that kept me laughing from one page to the next. Rock on, Amy! When is your next book coming out?"
2,A book without an audience,"I wasn't sure what I was getting into when I got this book. From the title, it could have been a compendium of funny anecdotes about throwing house parties with lessons to be learned from each. That would have probably better satisfied the apparent intention behind I Like You, as well as have been much more accessible. But instead, I Like You is exactly the opposite: a book of party advice with tongue-in-cheek humor thrown directly and often imperceptibly into each paragraph or list. The result leaves one wondering if this is a humor book or a book about party planning. Knowing Amy Sedaris as a comedienne, and not being of a party planning slant, this book certainly felt to me a lot more like the latter than the former. To a novice party planner looking for some hip modern advice, it will probably feel the opposite. Which leaves me wondering: who is supposed to like this book?"
2,Isn't funny enough,"I loved ""Strangers with Candy"" and I also love anything written by David Sedaris, so I figured a book by his sister Amy would be a stitch. It had some funny moments but for the most part this book was confusing. I'm afraid to try any of the recipes because I can't tell if she is being serious or not. I think maybe the recipes are real but the photos and things are DISGUSTING. I get that she intended for the book to be weird and gross because well... that's Amy Sedaris. But I just didn't find it very funny. It was too serious to be truly funny and too weird to be truly serious, if that makes any sense.I did get a tickle out of her descriptions of what to do for children's parties. That was kind of funny. The photos of the plastic food were just odd. I spent a good amount of money on the book and I threw it into my ""books to donate"" box as soon as I finished it."
2,Trying too hard,"Having enjoyed her brother's writing I thought I might be amused by this book. However, she's trying too hard to be funny/sarcastic and it falls flat. Even the catch phrase of the title that is used over and over in the book is not catchy."
5,Amazon Rocks!!,"Thank you so much for getting the book to me in a timely manner! I really appreciate when a company says they will deliver something within 2 days, and they actually come through!"
5,More like I LOVE YOU Amy!,"I am a horrible hostess...or at least I was until I got this book! My life is rich, full, and delectable thanks exclusively to this book!"
5,Hilarious!,"This book had me and several other friends rolling on the floor. Amy is so funny and very talented. If you have a lousy sense of humor than this book probably isn't for you. However, I thought it was delightful - the pictures, the recipes, the comments... Love!"
3,Quirky,"This may prove to be the most difficult book I've ever reviewed. It's a cookbook with recipes such as Split Pea Soup, Yogurt Spaghetti, Southern Fried Chicken, Yorkshire Pudding, cakes for special occasions, assorted drinks, as well as instructions on party planning, conversation starters for blind dates, how to give yourself a breast exam, the art of putting on panty hose, and gift ideas for the elderly. Also included are craft ideas such as how to make a needle wallet, a paper clip necklace, brick bookends, and several other useless items. Anecdotes are sprinkled throughout. This might make a unique idea for a quirky hostess gift. Note: contains profanity."
5,This book is off the hook,"I had no idea what to expect other than humor, obviously.This book has information on etiquette and manners, classic recipes, social suggestions, and tips in areas you would never expect. You can read it cover to cover, or open any page and start new every time. I have to mention the ridiculous (in a good way) photography, illustrations and various notes that dot each spread. A refreshing compilation."
4,My God.......,"My God its hard to imagine that this is Jerri Blank. Anyone who doesn't know who that is in for a shock. Strangers with Candy was and still is one of my all time favorite shows. I just can't get over how good Amy looks. As for content. It is a very non-PC, and for many; offencive. Some people just need to grow some thicker skin and get a life. Sedaris has a wonderful sense of humor that is in your face and subtle all at the same time. I wish one day I could meet a girl like Amy SedarisOver all this book provided me with a few hours of out loud laughter and some intriguing ideas. Highly recommended"
4,Sedaris = Sarcastic = Hilarious = Wonderful,"Amy Sedaris has a style of scarcasm that comes through with just a look. The cover of the book was enough to make me want to make a purchase. The jacket sleeve blurb is hilarious and I encouage anyone considering this book to read that first. If you don't smile or laugh, it's probably not for you. Also check out the ""bonus"" material she has hidden under the cover. This woman goes all out for her guest and that is what you are when you read this book. She has some geniune ideas and suggestions for hosting and I do bleieve Martha would disagree with most of them. A great coffee table book and conversation starter.Recommended to anyone with a sense of humor."
5,Great Gift For Crafty Lady,"I purchased this book for my fiance' for Christmas and she loved it! It is just the right mix of crafts and irreverence. I'm not into the whole ""hospitality"" thing but I even thought this was a great book. If you, or someone you know, likes to laugh while learning new ways to make people feel comfortable at your next get-together, then this book is perfect. Especially if they have a pet rabbit."
5,Hilarious and extra silly,"Replete with actual recipes and full-on menus for theme entertaining, Amy Sedaris' book is an entertaining read. There are plenty of photos and illustrations for all of her home advice shenanignans. This book proved to be a great gift for the domestic challenged and those confined to bedrest."
3,Did she write it like this to make herself stay awake?,"Okay, I find the basic premise of this book (how to throw a successful party) a wee bit dull. About as appealing as sink scum. But I have to grant that Amy Sedaris' truly wacky sense of humor kept me awake through about half the book. It reads like Martha Stewart on LSD. And that may be an understatement.Little kitschy party decorating, food preparation and entertainment venue tips, details, and full recipe instruction are freely laced and larded with richer and racier snippets and bits which may send you into hysterical whoops of laughter - or maybe a heart attack - at any moment. Keep your eyes peeled for her non-PC hostessing tips for when you have a gay guest (listen up brother David), or her feminine hygiene advice - doorman approved.Alas, I would have been happier with more readable wackiness and far fewer recipes and pretty, inventive photos."
5,My Review Of Amy Sedaris' New Book,"This book is hilarious and has a lot of good recipes and other fun stuff. Also, the pictorials of Sedaris is sexy as well as funny. The star of Comedy Central's Strangers With Candy has earned a rep for herself with this book. I am looking forward to more of Amy's books in the future."
5,The anti-Martha Stewart manifesto!,"Amy Sedaris is flipping hysterical. Plus, she can cook and likes to fold origami placesettings for her dinner parties. That, in my book, puts her high on my list of people I'd like to take to lunch.I her book I Like You: Hospitality Under the Influence, Sedaris shares some great tips for hostesses, a wealth of menus and recipes, and some great party theme ideas. Even better - she does it with a liberal dose of humor for grown-ups.It's a book you can read cover-to-cover or in short, easily digested segments. (No pun intended.) And if you love to host parties, she's a lot more palatable than Martha Stewart."
3,"I Like You, too..","The book is funny in parts, but I didn't appreciate the foul language. It did have some interesting recipes in it, so will probably not put it in the Goodwill box for now."
3,A little surprised,"I'm surprised at how much I didn't like this book. It's nicely put together and the layout is well thought out, but it's just a little off putting. Maybe it's the 1950's vibe or just the fact that she can be a little too silly. The information is really good, and I'll probably use it. I just wouldn't go so far as to say she's the next Ms. Manners."
2,It's a cook book!,"I expected funny stories about entertaining but ""Hospitality Under the Influence"" is an Amy Sedaris cook book. If you want another cook book, buy this. BUT if you want funny stories, you'd be better off with a book by her brother, David Sedaris."
2,Not for everyone!,This is not what I expected. Parts of the book area little zany and parts of the book are just plain fun.There is however some swearing in the book and thereis some information that is not appropriate for childrento read. This should be rated for Adults Only.
2,just not very funny or useful,"I bought this for a friend who loves to cook and has a great sense of humor. I am now wondering what to do with it. The recipes seem to be aimed at people who have never learnt to cook and don't want to. The humor -- well, tastes differ, but for me it falls flat. Really rather disappointing after the rave reviews I read. Oh well..."
2,Not as Pictured,"I ordered this item with the express purpose of putting my own rubber handle on it and painting it myself, no stickers, just flat wood. Shipping was prompt enough, but when I received the item it was not at all as pictured. The shape was different, granted more accurate to an actual cricket bat, but not flat as shown in the photo. It also had its own cheap rubber handle already attached, something that I cannot take off the item. It was also covered in big black and yellow brand stickers which I will have to peal off and then sand over the whole bat just so that it won't be sticky with adhesive residue. I am giving two starts for the shipping and the fact that the item proper is better material than advertised, but be forwarned, you will not be getting anything that resembles the photo that the seller has provided to Amazon."
3,Not bad...,"This item was ok. I got one as a gag gift for my fiance for Christmas, but it ended up looking more like a paddle than a cricket bat."
1,cute but defective,"The first time I received these speakers one of the speakers was broken. When I received the replacement, the on/off switch always remained on. They're really cute and the sound quality isn't terrible, but they are cheap and defective."
4,Adorable!,"The only reason I gave 4 stars is because the sound quality is not great. However, if you're buying these speakers it's probably not for the sound quality. They are absolutely adorable. I bought them for my cube at work. They even have bean bag butts."
4,Rossini: A Biography,"This Italian film is very accurate Biography about the life of famous Opera composer of ""The Barber of Seville"" and ""William tell""....The music is first class and the acting is very good.The Climax of the film is his meeting with Beethoven. I am very glad that I had the oppertunity in viewing this first rate film and I recomend it to all Music lovers to see it."
4,Old movie but interesting,"Do not expect modern quality. The movie dates to 1943 and this DVD is not made from a pristine print. The light balance varies, there are lots of artifacts, and at times the obligatory English subtitles come into the image space. The sound varies and some of the high notes are distorted. Nevertheless this is a fascinating film. It has a number of extended staged excerpts from various Rossini operas (Il Barbiere di Siviglia, Otello, Mose for example). It provides some idea of pre World War II performance practices in Italy. Like many older opera or musical films, it provides a glimpse of staged productions that are now only memory."
5,Very smooth finish...nice edge.,"Used it on Black Walnut and was very pleased. The quad cut bit is worth the money. Very smooth and clean surface and required little, or no, sanding."
5,Incredible,"WOW! I just tried this for the first time and it is incredible! I have been struggling to learn to shave with a straight (cut throat) razor, and I have tried all manner of shaving foams, gels and creams, but This stuff beats 'em all. Very comfortable and gives a very close shave. Best of all, no nicks or cuts."
5,Great Product,"Bought this in addition to the Panasonic Arc IV shaver. Combined it makes for a great shave. I occasionally use it with my safety razor too and it works well, as long as one is careful."
2,Not my style,"I've never tried a ""premium"" shaving cream and got this on a lightening deal. Overall I'm not that impressed. If you want it to work effectively you need A LOT, way more than you'd use for the standard foaming cream. I also don't notice any improvement in how my skin feels, I'd say it feels about the same as when I use the foam. Basically what I'm saying is it costs more, and for me, doesn't add any benefit over a can of 99 cent barbasol."
3,"Great for the razor, just one issue.",I use a safety razor; this clogs the razor very quickly which becomes annoying as I have to re-warm my face to keep the shave smooth. Seems like this is made for more of the BIC type razor.
2,Basically a gimmick. No better than products costing a third of the price,"I was given a container of this product as a gift. I am glad that I didn't pay for it because I would have felt like a sucker. As far as the performance of the product, it's okay, but I did not find it to be as good as other high-end shaving gels I've used. I have found King of Shaves Alpha Gel to be the best of these non-lathering shave products; it's available in many drug stores, Target, etc., for $5-$7. Billy Jealousy costs three times that amount and in my opinion wasn't as good. I guess they're marketing the funky name...but I don't know why someone would pay $20 for this stuff."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought a new electric shaver and needed a thin type of shaving cream to use when shaving. There are not many creams on the market that are thin, so I was happy when I came across the Billy Jealousy Hydoplane Shave Cream. I liked what I saw and felt as soon as I squeezed a little into my hand. I put it on my face and it was thin and wet, BUT it felt like it got dry almost immediately. The best word to describe it getting dry would be tacky (my face was a little wet like the directions suggest). I tried shaving and it felt rough. I tried washing the cream off the shaver and the cream seemed gooey.I stopped, washed up, and just put on some regular shick shaving cream. I ended up using an 1/8"" drop to make the cream as thin as possible after lathering, and it worked great! My face was not all foamy because of the 1/8"" size and I got a great shave with my my electric shaver."
1,It's really good at 1 thing for sure!,"One thing that this shaving cream is superb at is... Are you ready for it??? Clogging up my razor over, and over, and over again! I had to beat the living crap out of my blade to get billies Jealousy out from between the blades. With regular shaving cream, I never had any problems, just a quick swish through the water and voila! Hair and shaving cream gone. NOT THIS STUFF! It is like glue between the blades. Just regular old Walgreen's shave gel is superior to this overpriced razor glue, in my opinion."
1,"Does not contain ""menthol"" but contains peppermint..same thing.","This product contains too many irritants to consider lime, ginger, orange and grapefruit are all volatile fragrance oils with NO benefit to skin, especially the peppermint!!! at least they list the ingredients so you can know the truth and make your own decision...because what they tell you is misleading! yes it does provide for a smooth shave, but there are cheaper and better formulations out there that OMIT the irritants."
4,Great with an Electric,"I initially tried this product with a Mach-3 Turbo razor. Given the reviews and the price, the results were disappointing. I still experienced too much irritation on my neck to shave every day. Later, I tried it with a Panasonic wet-dry electric shaver and this seems like the perfect lube for that application. It doesn't make the electric shave any closer, but there is no irritation to my face or neck, and no build-up on the blades and foil."
4,Good Shaving Cream,"It works pretty well and gives me a close shave. It definitely beats regular shaving cream! However last Christmas I was given some L'Occitane shaving oil, which I used under regular shaving cream and I got a smoother shave than with this product alone."
4,converted my husband,"my husband has thick course hair and he swears he cant use an electric shaver, just makes him have ingrown hair etc. he gave up on many shaving products bc of price and failure to produce. his skin is sensitive as well. ingredients can bother him .Well, we have a winner. less razor burn, less ingrown hair too (which is more to do with the razor) i use it on my legs too."
5,Best shave; hands down.,"Being a man that appreciates a good shave, I've quested for the best possible products to achieve just that. My quest is over. Billy Jealousy Hydroplane easily deserves 5 stars. Previously, I wasn't able to shave everyday without irritation. Now that I've found this line of products, it's actually enjoyable to shave. No ingrown hairs. No razor burn. No razor bumps. Combined with Billy Jealousy Hot Towel pre-shave, it's the only shave I've had that deserves 6 stars! Now, if only amazon.com would offer the ability to rate products above 5 stars."
4,Good,"This is a good product for me. But not perfect. It did make a difference.in my shave. Smells a little fruity,like lemon, but it is not strong at all, quite good though. I will buy again. Little goes a long way."
3,overrated,"Finally, for the very steep price, I think this product delivers underwhelmingly. Certainly, it good. But King lubricating oil, @+-$3.95 used alone or with Gillette or other silicon gel gives a really good shave, at least with an electric razor which is what I generally use, wet shave. Used with Gillette 5-blade system, there's no discerniable difference whatsoever with the lower priced spread. Perhaps it's worth a try, as in you decide. But I personally do not think it's worth the money."
2,No Improvement Over Drugstore Gels,"This ""cream"" does not lather well, it's too liquidy or something. I tried it a several times and was could not help getting cut. While the scent was pleasant, it is definitely not one of the better creams out there. I have a tough beard as well and this did nothing to make the shave easier. I even used their hot towel treatment, but nothing. To be frank, it is not much better than a canned shaving gel at a drugstore. Overall, it is overrated and should only be used if you want to pay a lot of money for under performing product."
2,overrated,"THis product was touted to be the best lubricant available. Sorry, not even close. I use Lush Razorantium and it is far superior. It is a better lubricant, odorless, virtually nick-proof and efficient.I have tried virtually every brand available from luxury to inexpensive and Lush tops them all. It is a lotion style cream...not foaming.My beard is tough and my skin is somewhat sensitive if that helps for informational purpose."
3,I don't understand the hype...,"This stuff is just barely better than any random gel you'd get at your local drugstore. If you want a good shave, get a real badger hair brush and a shave cream like Musgo or Proraso. This stuff is too liquidy and doesn't stay on the skin, I don't understand why everyone seems to think it's so good. Go try a real shave cream, you will not be disappointed."
2,It was great until...,"It's good but completely overpriced! I thought it was really good until one day I didn't have it with me and needed to shave and used my Nivea body wash instead and that worked surprisingly well. Now I use the Nivea Active 3 and it works much better than the hydroplane; it produces less friction, giving me a less irritated shave (I use a Panasonic wet/dry electric shaver). The hydroplane feels really smooth when you first put it on, but after a few passes with my electric shaver, it starts producing friction and I have to reapply another layer; I don't have that problem with the Active 3 plus it's dirt cheap compared to the hydroplane."
2,"This shave cream is mediocre, at best.","I bought this product, based on the recommendation of a few reviews, when I bought my Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV Nano Men's Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver on Amazon. It does no better than Gillette's gel foam and costs five times more. The bottle is made of such thick plastic that it is very difficult to squeeze even a ""quarter size"" blob into your hand. Stick with your grocery store favorite, Billy J. is no improvement."
5,A cut above the rest,"I recently took up shaving my head (that is, the portions that Mother Nature hadn't already removed for me). At first, I was using various brands of pretty standard shaving cream, as well as a disposable razor. That didn't work so well. So I did some research and, lo, was pointed to this Billy Jealously Hydroplane goo. And you know, despite the high price, it was well worth the investment.The beauty of this stuff is, it really does cling to your head, maintaining a slick, smooth protective barrier between your skin and the razor. And it stays that way, even as you rinse off the razor with warm water between strokes. (For the record, I also invested in a better-quality razor, one of those Gillette dealies with five blades. Very nice.)Anyway, since I started using this stuff, I've gotten nice clean, comfortable shaves -- without nary a cut (on my head or face)."
5,Great!,"This product makes shaving sooo much more comfortable than shaving within regular shaving cream. If you have a rough beard like I do, you should absolutely try it!"
4,Works well,"I got a sample of this stuff with an order of Derby Extra blades. I normally use Art of Shaving pre-shave oil along with AOS shaving cream or Proraso Cream. The Billy Jealousy, by itself, does a nice job of lubricating your skin and providing comfort while shaving while providing a close shave. My face, however, feels better with my regular battery of shaving paraphernalia. Even after putting on my normal after shave balm, my skin felt a bit dry with the Billy Jealousy. That being said, I'm going to order a bottle for travel and for those times I need to shave again in the evening. It's really hassle-free to use and requires no brush and very little prep.It won't be my primary shave cream, but I plan to use it fairly frequently especially when I'm in a hurry."
3,Hydroplane,I liked the the fact that the razor glides and really minimizes the drag and nicks. What I don't like about it is how quickly it dries. Not sure if the slick creme gives me the smooth shave I anticipated. It's okay but nothing to get really excited about
2,Mediocre at best,"First day I used this product, it did seem to work as it said. But whether it's just my skin type or what, I could not comfortably shave with this everyday without irritation, I used this product exactly as it said and I still had a lot of irritation."
5,"Works unobtrusively, no irritation","Works without irritation and forms a very thin layer on skin, not like very foamy expensive products. Simple and works!"
2,OK Product .... Not worth the money!!!!,"I bought this product when I purchased a Panasonic Electric shaver. I typically use Aveeno shaving gels; however, in a momentary lapse of judgment, I splurged on this product. The Billy Jealously shave cream is extremely slick, but this does not translate into a closer or more comfortable shave. The product costs 4 times the price of an already premium Aveeno product without any clear benefits. I personally believe the Aveeno product provides a closer and more comfortable shave. Do not waste your money on this product unless you have a personal trust fund and prefer a designer name to a premium product (Aveeno)."
2,Wouldn't buy again,I was swayed by the great reviews. I wouldn't purchase again. There must be some trick to using it because I can not get as good a shave as with Lab Series or Headslick.
5,We like it!,"This is the first of this type product we've tried actually. Taste is good, slickness good as well. Was told there was no ""tingly"" sensation at all."
5,Great book,Thank you for such a wonderful book. The children love it. What a great history book. Can't ask for better.
2,too dumb to read,"anne rice, make up your mind what kind of novels you'e going to write. This story is just too dumb"
4,Poor Quality Good movie,"I love the movie but other agree the quality is quiet bad,in parts pices of the film are cut off at the edges the film is also bubbled into english wich is a shame sinse you dont really get the feeling of the actors as you would if it was in italian, The movie is quiet good girl(Aida) is left by her boyfriend and goes in search of him only to fall in love with his younger brother(lorenzo), this relationship is not accepted by his guardian and his teacher a local priest, her former boyfriend vertually disapears in the film and deals with Aida and Lorenzo relationship. One of the beast seens is when Lorenzo goes and looks for Aida at her hotel to find her in a party, good movie BAD quality"
1,Ripoff,"This may be a good movie but one's enjoyment of it is destroyed by the transfer. I don't know about the USA but Britain has consumer protection laws as does Australia & Canada. Dvds of such appalling quality as this should not be allowed to be sold. This is worse than the worst pirated videos I've seen. I'm not blaming Amazon, but why isn't this Koch transfer in the same legal class as pirated videos? People shouldn't be allowed to charge people for such a product. I haven't seen such terrible video resolution since 1st generation mobile phone videos! I'm binning my copy as I wouldn't inflict in on anyone else."
3,Just got it.,"Not quite polished art work, nor on glossy paper like Flames of War is, I think it's more compelling. Haven't taken a look at DUST which it seems to compare, nor to SJGs Wierd War II...but if you want a SciFi WWII thing to play with...Battletech in the 40s kinda...here it is."
3,Not what I was looking for.,"I was looking for a song which does not seem to be on any of Kim Burrells' recordings. However, in spite of my disappointment, I found the CD easy to listen to, and I enjoy Kim Burrells' style of singing. Her voice is tremendous."
4,She really hits it off!(Go Kim),"HERE SHE BLOWS: with the ballad-driven ""Prodigal Son"" this song will bring u back to the altar. She has been totally a blessing to me. Also the smash hit ""I'll Keep Holding On"" the slow-templed smooth ""Holy Ghost"""
5,Luv Her Please Help Me,I think she is great and I lover her music.But Can anyone help me find her first album titled: Try Me. And Yes she is UP there with Karen Clark-Sheard!
5,"Kim is an awesome, anointed woman of God.","Kim has one of the best Gospel CD's that I have heard in a long time. Kim truly has a style and an anointing of her very own. I had the opportunity to meet,spend time, and sing in the same concert with Kim in Wilmington DE. She is truly a woman of God. I told Kim that my favorite song was Over and Over again. The dynamics in this song are incredible. Not only does Kim sing well on CD but you must hear her in person. I can truly say that I love every song on her CD. No matter how old you are, Kim has something for everyone on this CD. Kim I can't wait for your next CD. Also, please release your very first CD. Not many people had the opportunity to hear it. God is going to bless you in a very special way.I love you Sis!Linda"
5,Truly annointed by God!,This album is one of a kind! Kim has truly been annointed of God. It really ministers to me everytime I have listened to it. I love you Kim! Thank you for surrendering your gift to God!
3,Good movie. poor quality,"This film brought back some fond memories from my childhood. However, there was something terribly wrong with this particular VHS copy. It was all fuzzy and kept flipping out on me. I hope I'm able to find a better one eventually."
5,A Must Book for NCIDQ Preparation !!!!!,"Well-summarized and easy to follow. The book covers almost all the information you need to pass NCIDQ test. There are 23 (or 24!?) chapters and it takes about 2 months to study the entire book. Every chapters starts with reviewing basics so that you do not have to go back here and there of your old textbooks from schools. Combined with 3-day classes for NCIDQ and 1-day class on building codes offered by ASID, I passed NCIDQ on fall, 1996. I did not studied anything-else. This is the right material to study. The shortest way to build up the knowleadge to pass the exam. Trust me !!!!!"
3,NCIDQ Exam Changing,"This is a good book. However, the NCIDQ exam is changing -- a new exam will be administered in October, 2000. This book may not be as helpful for those that will be taking the new NCIDQ exam in October."
2,Warning,Despite its title the book is not approved by NCIDQ for use in studying for the exam since it contains a number of serious inaccuracies related to technical and code issues.
2,Very disappointing,"I _know_ children have more interesting things to say than the conversations collected in this book. So why this selection? It's a mystery.. there are a few gems, but too many of them are just ho-hum."
5,This book puts the reader on pins and needles !,"Ryzuk presents a detailed compilation of facts surrounding the Gainesville murders in such a way that keeps the readers eyes glued to the pages. A must read for all True Crime buffs. If you like such thrillers as ""Double Jeopardy"" you'll thoroughly enjoy this one."
4,"Very graphic, Very scary,","I've written several newspapers articles about the 1990 Gainesville Student Murders and I must say that The Gainesville Ripper is a pretty accurate account of the mad and macarbe manner in which five young college students were viciously murdered. What this man did to his victims is something that Freddy Krueger would not have done. By the time I got to the last page I was crying uncontrollably and I was also afraid to go to sleep. In fact, I slept with a knife under by pillow for several months. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is an avid true crime reader."
4,Healing the Wounds of Sexual Addiction,"I recommend this book for those who are recovering from the devastating reality of a spouse who is battling sexual addiction. It is a challenging journey and no one should face the healing process alone. This book provides education, clarity, and compassion to the spouse or the families recovering from the trauma of addiction. I gave this book four stars, rather than five, because I can not agree with the approach taken by the author to label the spouse as ""co-addict"". This term is not an accurate representation of the dynamic between a spouse and an addict, and it generates additional grief and pain rather than providing the sympathetic access necessary for healing to begin. All in all, this is a worthy read and I recommend it to those who, like me, need a starting place."
2,Fiind another product,"The seller was great, unformately the product aren't that great. The jackfruits that were use to make these aren't ripe therefore the dried fruits tasted bland, not sweet, and sometimes bitter. They're not very crispy and so hard to chew on. I bought a whole bunch, but only eat 1/2 of every bags and throw the rest away. Remember, it's not the food itself, it's the company that processes it. I've had some from another brand and they tasted great."
4,This book is a classic.,Dr. Meyer has written an excellent expostition on the Life of Abraham. This is so vital because Abraham was a pivotal point in human history. Most of the troubles of today can be traced back to this man and his progeny. We use Dr. Meyers books in our Bible College as a text. Highly recommended.Pastor Howard Cameron author of:The Eternal Purpose of God: The Why of Who You Are
2,Theology - not a reference work!,"This is a 192 page sermon based on the life of Abraham as given in the Old Testament. The only reference material used was the King James version of the Bible (and a certain amount of the author's speculation). This book attempts to use the life of Abraham to illustrate Christian theology. Book itself originally written approx. 100 years ago, rather than in 1996 when it was edited for publication. I strongly suspect all other works by F.B. Meyer to be in the same vein."
2,Tribute of shame!,"Wow! Over the past few years, I have noticed the increasing popularity in ""Tribute"" albums for cult classic artists. Example:Depeche Mode, The Cure, Duran Duran etc. The one profound similarity in all of these, is how really BAD they are! This new installment for regergitated trash proves the point that, perfection should not be tampered with. Not only are half of the vocalists on it sound like drunken karaoke singers, but who ever mastered the CD forgot to mix each track down on some what the same level, leaving you adjusting your volume control for each song... That's CHEAP! Oh well, I'm still holding on for a new album which I hope is in the works. Erasure is truly one of the greatest bands of all time. Lets keep any cover songs in the bars for all local bands to do what they must with them, not on my CD player."
1,Really desappointing!,"I am from these kind of people who buys every single thing from Erasure, without even look a little further. But when I heard this ""tribute"", I didn't know what to think. I was expecting a really amazing thing, and what I found was a bunch of unknown bands trying to emulate what I think is the best band ever formed. I agree with those who expected a really different tribute, one made by the best of the best, paying tribute to those 2 guys who really made (and are still making) history. I really don't recommend this CD, I don't want anybody get as disappointed as I got."
2,Sounds more like a Karoke night in a local pub!,"Dissapointing,I understand that this is a ""tribute"" album,and you shouldn't compare it to the real Erasure,but if most of the artist's didn't try too much to sound like Andy Bell,then it would be better!"
1,Tribute??? to Erasure,Poor vocals and amature production make this record not only a waste of money but a waste of plastic (and whatever else a cd is made from.) I have been a fan of Erasure even through their past few uneven (and frankly bad)albums. But this is no tribute worthly of them. Many of the vocalists sound like they are gasping for breath and the synth arrangements are swimming in so much reverb that your speakers will buzz.
4,A Good Tribute from REAL Erasure Fans,"This is a fairly good collection of covers of classic Erasure tunes done by mostly unknown synthpop artists. Bands like Erasure and Depeche Mode (and PSB, NO, etc) have influenced a whole generation of new synthpop bands. Just cuz they're not on VH1 or MTV doesn't mean they aren't talented, just that the scene went underground. (And let me also just say that some of these bands are BETTER than Erasure (whom I love very much)). Check out Brave New World, Iris, KieTheVez or The Echoing Green if you want similar artists.Now that being said, I still think that this comp could have been better. Some of the artists indeed don't sound like much effort was put forth. But nonetheless, it's good to introduce Erasure fans to new artists.As for other mainstream artists doing covers of Erasure- give me a break! Sara McLaughlin (sp?) couldn't pull it off. No way no how. Tributes are just that- a tribute to someone who means something to you."
4,A Good New Take on Erasure Greats,"Tribute albums rarely get my attention, but Erasure's music is so unique that I took a gamble and purchased this CD. Much to my surprise, the new and updated versions of this song are a great tribute and often flattering to the songwriting of Erasure. Fun, upbeat and well done. Not perfect, but a very good addition to any Erasure fan's collection. Give it a listen! Viva Erasure!"
1,ALMOST AS BAD AS ERASURE'S LAST ALBUM,A GROUP THAT HAS PUT OUT TWO HORRIBLE LAST ALBUMS HARDLY DESERVES A TRIBUTE. BUT THIS - BAD GROUPS DOING BAD SONGS WAS JUST TOO MUCH TO STOMACH. :(
5,Original Pulsar lasted 21 years- worn daily,I liked my first Pulsar so much that I bought the exact same one again 21 years later.
1,Water Resistant -- RU Joking?,"The watch is good looking, fits well and runs well. However the advertising said it was water resistant at a rating of 30 meters. The brochure that came with the watch however said that it would resist splashing water, no immersion. So what does 30 meters mean?"
4,happy choice,"I am very pleased with this watch. It works great, looks great, and is comfortable. I only have two complaints: the hands are supposed to glow int he dark and they don't; the thinness of the hands make it a little difficult to tell the time sometimes."
2,out of focus,"Strange and unsatisfying biography, focused on minutae of Dickens' vacations to the exclusion of his literature.""From Rome, they went to Siena and then Florence, happy to have had only three days of rain. On the road, they carried their own brandy, cloves, and tea"" [page. 297-8]. The moment-to-moment of this trip fills ten pages, including so much emphasis re the facial grooming habits of the three men concerned, and the qualities of the various beds they slept in, that it's tempting to describe the text as voyeuristic. Follwed by just three pages re Bleak House, perhaps Dickens' most adventurous and anomalous work (two narrators). To me, a quirky choice of priorities, at best.Perhaps the intention of the author was to present ""the human side of Dickens"" as a supplement to the literary biographies which already exist. If so, a more appropriate title might be ""Not By Literature Alone"", or etc. Readers interested in Dickens' writing as opposed to his leisure might want to look elsewhere."
2,worse then boring,"two stars due to the tons of information, but way too much that is strangely disconnected from Dickens' vibrant writing and his nearly frantic appreciation of life. Reading this (many passages you have to skip through they are so deadly), it's as though Kaplan waded through all of Dickens' writings even though not one of the novels struck a chord and really got to him. And there's that deadly present tense, i.e. Dickens goes here instead of went, writes to Forster instead of wrote; only makes it all more artificial, distant, bloodless, boring."
2,"Too many details, not enough emotion!","This book seems to have been written by a business man and not a man of literature. I felt as though I were reading Charles Dicken's family budget diary rather than a life-history. This biography is lengthy with details that are indescribably boring. I found myself longing for more of the emotional aspects of this marvelous man's life. Kaplan writes in a dry, uninspiring style. I had 'great expectations' for this book but found those expectations dashed to pieces on the rock of boredom."
2,"Starts out pretty good, but leaves you wishing it would just","This books starts out fairly good and then picks up steam in its description of Dickens' youth. But somewhere near the middle it seems to get lost in endless facts which might be called useless. I personally don't care about every single item in Dickens business affairs. I would have personally rather seen more about public reactions to each novel and more discussion about the development of each novel. This would have been a pretty good book had the author cut it in half and perhaps titled it ""Dickens: His Life Before 40""."
2,Well Researched--and Too Much So,"Kaplan is an excellent researcher. His book is also boring as all heck, too. Dickens, in my opinion, is usually quite funny, or poignant, or both. Don't bother, unless you're doing a paper on Dicken's kidney problems or his friends, and who cares?"
3,Difficult and too long,"I found this exercise video to be exceedingly difficult for my beginner level. This seems more like an intermediate level. Also, too many repetitive motions working the same muscle groups for far too long. This also lends to the notion that this is meant for someone much more advanced. I actually can't imagine myself performing this workout again, but because I can see some intermediate or advanced exercisers enjoying it, I am giving it 3 stars."
