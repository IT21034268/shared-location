1,Don't Waste Your Money!!!!,Too bad I bought this book before discovering the author works for the Washington Post. She can't say three sentences in the book without bashing the President. I doubt the First Lady had anything to do with this lousy piece of trash. I wish I could get my money back!
2,Not as good as it could have been,"It starts out like Laura Bush's Rules for Driving, but skydives after the opening pages, in which the then 17-year-old Laura kills a young man with her car, who just coincidentally happens to be her boyfriend!My interest in the book sharply dove after that, as it appears that coincidental killing is the most appealing thing about Laura Bush."
1,The Perfect Wife,"She doesn't speak out about any issues of importance. The President must think that she is the prefect wife, indeed."
1,Why don't they discuss it?,The woman KILLED a boy - she was driving her car down the street and of all people in town for her to accidently kill - she runs over her boyfriend!!! Talk about coincidence! There's a lot of bloodshed in that family. They're the new Kennedy's!! Let's open a dialogue about what a murderer Laura Bush is! Why didn't her husband send her to the deathchair???
4,Good Read,"After thoroughly enjoying 'American Wife' by Curtis Sittenfeld, I decided to pick up this book. I was hoping for more juicy details on the life of Laura, but the book was still interesting. It dragged a bit at parts, but overall was a quick read with some interesting insight. I particularly liked reading about the twins. Despite the author's fondness for Laura, you can tell she has issues with the way the Bush's raised the girls. To be honest, her account gave me a negative view of the twins - their entitled attitudes and spoiled behavior."
2,Nothing new here,"I would recommend borrowing this book from the library. As other reviewers have pointed out-there are factual errors-one of the most glaring being that Barbara Bush is NOT a Smith graduate. She dropped out to marry George. I have read several other books and articles about the Bushes and this is just a compiliation of other people's work. It seems like one of those ""quickie"" books put out for an election year. A lot of the quotes and incidents cited in previous articles and books are just rehashed here. It is interesting if you haven't read anything on Laura Bush, but if you have-save your money-I wish that I had."
1,Ann (Spearheart)!,"Ann Gerhart has shown her true color - yellow! She allowed for the cover a beautiful and tender picture of President and Mrs. Bush because she was afraid without such a cover, the book wouldn't sell! The cover misleads! In between the cover is only scathing and negative writing! Obviously, she has snuckered us all into buying a book that we thought would give us unbiased, honest information about the First Lady of The United States. Wrong! She thinks we are all stupid and that we won't pick up on her inuendos, distortions, and outright inflammatory statements! She just as well could have written an instructional image marketing book - ""An Attempt to Destroy someone by lethal words!"" Ms. Spearheart even stooped so low as to attack the Bush twins and compare them unfavorably with Chelsea Clinton. This book will anger you!"
1,VERY Misleading,"I am so upset I wasted money on this ""book"". The title and jacket description are so very misleading. The author talks out both sides of her mouth praising Mrs. Bush with one and bashing her husband with the other. I don't want to pass it on, I don't want to take it to Goodwill where someone else will purchase it and be mislead also so I just might mail it back to the publisher. I will be very careful about any books published by Simon and Shuster again because they let this get to print without properly identifying it as a liberal piece."
1,"""The Play-Doh first lady"" (a quote)","Ann Gerhart has written a remarkably disparaging book about Laura Bush, a lady of integrity and courtesy. Gerhard is at once comical and irritating as she cloaks her thinly veiled arrogance with admitted inability to understand such composure. This book reveals Gerhard's patronizing attitude toward her subject with whom she avows fascination beginning ""when I heard that she wiped her shelves down with Clorox to relax and organized her extensive literary collection according to the Dewey decimal system."""
2,Borrow it from the library ...,"I found that this book seemed to be put together, not from in-depth interviews the author has conducted with Laura Bush, but from various articles and interviews done by someone else. There was a serious lack of substance. The author even repeats several quotes throughout the book as if she was at a loss for material. I don't feel that she has any more insight into the life of Laura Bush than anyone else out there. Yes, she does go into meticulous detail in describing certain aspects of Laura Bush's life in Midland, but who most of those descriptions fall into the ""Who cares?"" category. The book was disappointing and I wouldn't spend my money on it. Not that Laura Bush is not a good subject for a book but this one in particular is not up to par."
1,"pathetic , uninformative, Bio","This is such a boring read.I'm glad I picked it up at the library. The author Ann Gerhart did an exasperating poor job. It's not much of a biography. Throughout the book she's repeating what she's heard from the people who still live in Midland,Texas, plus she gives alot of second hand reporting from people who now know Mrs.Bush. From the beginning chapter to the end she reiterates that at seven-teen she drove her car into another while speeding. I counted six times then stopped. She used words like terrible car accident, manslaughter, killed, and snuffed! I feel deeply sorry for the young man Mike Douglas (who attented her high school) dying in that unfortunate collision, especially his father who had to see his son die in that explosion. The book made the Bushes girls sound like 'thing one and thing two '( from The Cat in the Hat )."
2,Is Ann Gerhart the new Michael Moore?,"If you hate George Bush (and Texans) you will love this book. While it soars when describing being with Laura Bush on Capitol Hill on September 11th, it sinks when insults the Bush's parenting skills and questions whether the President supports his wife. (Page 169 ""Who takes care of her?.....She takes care of herself."")I was surprised at the undercurrent of venom."
5,"A sense of relief and hope, New York, New York","The title captured my attention. As I browsed through the table of contents, I realized there was a chapter on children with disabilities. I felt a sense of relief and hope come over me. My brother is autistic and for a long time I didnt know what to do. This book introduced me to many new opportunities for my brother, family and I to learn about various discipline ""things"" we can do to help him--too help eachother. I love this book--you will tooo if you have a child in your family that have problems with schooling or even disabilities. The other thing that was nice was that it was written by parents. Some books are written by people who arent parents but ""professionals."""
1,The most incredibly unreadable writing I have ever seen.,"The most incredibly unreadable writing I have ever seen. He simplify makes no sense. Even when he is just trying to talk about ""fortean"" phenomena I can't even make out what he is saying. Charles Ripley of ""Ripley's believe it of not"" were contemporaries Ripley became famous and Fort has dropped into obscurity and the reason all has to do with the writing."
1,Unreadable,"Rambling, run on sentences, and verbose.There is nothing redeeming about Mr. Fort'swriting style.Please, find a summation of his works, and don'twaste the space in your library."
3,"Clever insights, but extremely long book.","Charles Hoy Fort book contains extremely clever observations second to none in the history of philosophy (although he probably did not consider himself a philosopher), however the book is much too long. His insights could have been stated in 10 or at the most 20 pages. That is why I consider this book a perfect 5: the middle point between the best and worse books I've ever read."
3,good book about Vietnam War,It is a good book about Vietnam War but it tells you the version of an arrogant Colonel full of anger for having ruined his career! Nice book but I just can't stand the author!
2,Disappointing alternative to Proactiv,"Trying to find a more affordable alternative to Proactiv (still looking), I purchased this set once. The cleanser is ineffective at even removing all makeup and oil. It doesn't scrub either, it's mostly creamy. Acne was coming back so I went back to Proactiv. The moisturizer bottles were too small in my opinion. And the kit really needs a toner to remove the oil/makeup left behind.I'd like to find a system that doesn't use Benzoyl Peroxide as someday I would like to use towels, sheets and pillow cases that aren't just white."
2,The most work I've done for the smallest effect.,"This product was really unimpressive. It helped my skin, but not nearly the effect that I had gotten when I tried Proactiv. I wish I wasn't banking on it making me pristine before my wedding. Mostly my problem is oily skin, so it might be different for someone with different skin. The bottle sizes are very different, so it was easy to run out of one bottle before the other."
1,Worked for the first couple of weeks and then BROKE ME OUT!!!,"I used Proactiv for a little over two years and then decided to try something cheaper and hoped to get the same results. So, I saw Neutrogena Advanced Solutions on T.V and decided to try it. For the first week I didn't have any breakout; the second I had a pimple; the third week there were pimples here and there on my face and it made me upset. I understand that Neutrogena Advanced Solutions works for some people (probably those with mild acne) but it's by no means better than Proactiv Solution. I also tried other products beside Neutrogena Advanced Solutions that didn't work for me. I'm back to Proactiv now and i have clear beautiful skin again. Proactiv Solution is a little pricy but it's the BEST acne product that I have used by far. For those who have tried several acne products that did not work, try Proactiv Solution because it works!"
2,Does not work for adult acne,"If anything my acne was worse. I tried to stick with it, with hope, but....I was once told by a Dr to use Neutrogena clear bar or Basis for best results and I was excited to see this product by Neutrogena. I will save my money and go back to the bar. I had as good if not better results and no drying, AND its only $3-$4! I do love Amazon and Amazon subscribe and save, this product not so much."
4,This item is great,Great product but it dries your skinIf you have a sensitive skin I would try a different product.But this works great
3,Review is ongoing!,"My website, wwww.TheAcneResource.com is currently testing this product in our ""Cynical Trials"" blog. So far, so good, I guess, although the benzoyl peroxide lotion looks a big like egg white even after it's dry. Blackheads are diminished by day 2, but major pimples don't seem to be going anywhere fast. But I love the microfine beads in the cleanser, which smells great and has a nice lather to it."
2,Works as well as the expensive stuff!,"We've been shelling out hundreds of dollars for ProActiv for our teenaged daughter for the past couple of years, and all of sudden, it stopped working for her. I did a quick ""google"" and Neutrogena products came up. We gave it try. It took about 5 days to see results - then her face was clear! For the price - you can't beat it!11/27/2011: Actually, it doesn't work as well as Proactiv. My daughters face broke out big time. Never happened before. Might have to see a dermatologist now."
3,"I have no complaints, but so far I see no improvement.","Although I do like this, and can't complain about it, I can't say that my face has gotten any better, and I feel like I might as well be using something 1/4 the price."
2,Didn't work for me.,"First impression: lots of perfume in the products. Dried the face, gave rough patches on the sides of my cheeks. Got rid of blackheads, but that was all. Did not prevent cystic acne. Got rid of average pimples by drying harshly, and many more returned in its place. I used for 1.5 months before giving up. I'm going back to a less harsh routine, which is probably better for my face anyway. I feel this product made acne worse."
4,Alright,"I use another acne product, but after moving to CA I couldn't find it anywhere. Since I was busy packing and couldn't use the internet to order it online I stopped by my local Target and got the Neutrogena Acne System. There's a cleanser, day lotion, night lotion.The cleanser in the beginning seem pretty good, but after about a month's use it's okay. I probably will go back to my other acne system. I only have mild acne that doesn't break out a lot.The day lotion is useful since it also has 15 SPF. Perfect, since I don't have to apply two types of lotion in the morning rush hour.The night lotion is awkward...it makes your skin all tight and such. Probably the main reason why I won't purchase this system. Neutrogena products are great, but I this acne treatment doesn't do the job for me."
1,Broken out,"I used Proactiv for a long time. I have also tried everything else possible. The first 2 days of using Neutrogena felt good and my face felt clean. The third day, I woke up with a huge painful pimple and throughout the next week of using the product, I had 4-5 HUGE pimples all over my face. I had previously only had a few small ones here and there, so this product made it way worse. I switched back to Proactiv and my face has pretty much cleared up in a short amount of time."
2,Ouch!,"I recently used this system and experienced immense irritation and drying of my skin. After 2 days of use, even foundation was painful to wear. Then, my skin flaked off in big chunks. I use Neutrogena products such as the On-The-Spot Acne treatment and several moisturizers with no problems. I think that using the 3 products in this system at once can be harmful for sensitive skin.I'm sure for people who don't have sensitive skin, it must work. If you do, try it on just a patch of skin first and not your whole face. The packaging is nice and attractive, so that's why I gave it 2 stars."
5,Benzoyl Peroxide is key to clearing my acne,"I am 26 with mild to moderate acne. I've been using this product for about a year. I recommend it to all of my friends. It works if you are consistant with the regimine. Wash your face with the cleanser in the morning, use the moisturizer during the day (a little goes a long way with everything)Wash again at night & use a thin layer of the the benzoyle peroxide on areas that are broken out, follow with a moisturizing night cream of your choice. The benzoyl peroxide gel is harsh at first & will dry out your skin... but it WORKS and your skin will get used to it. Give it 2 weeks. Another thing to be mindful about is that the benzoyle peroxide will bleach your pillow case, but for me it's worth having clear skin. I just buy light colored pillow cases, no big deal. This stuff works for me. I use it everyday and have clear skin. I will always buy this product."
4,"Good on pimples, okay on skin","The cleanser -- it's alright. Doesn't overdry the skin or leave any residue. Feels clean and fresh after the wash.Benzoyl Peroxide Lotion-- great work! 2.5% is the best lowest dose on acne. My acne has cleared up and I don't get the huge ones anymore. However, because BP is known to dry the skin, it's best to put on a GOOD moisturizer afterwards. I know most people don't do anything after applying this lotion and that's why they complain of dryness. FIND A GOOD MOISTURIZER! I use Aveeno SPF 15 during the day and Clinique Dramatically Different Gel/Lotion at night. Also, results work best with applied frequently! It might take a couple days for your skin to get used to this, but aim for at least twice a day of this lotion.SPF 15 Lotion -- not a great fan of it. The fragrance is way too strong for me. I don't use it.I wish they sold more bottles of JUST 2.5% lotion at a cheaper price."
2,fail,"So for the price it's a waste of money. The salycilic acid just doesn't cut it i guess. it's too soft but , then again benzoyl peroxide is too strong. I could get2 or 3 other products here for this price"
1,Terrible! Don't waste your money!,"I had moderate acne on my chin forehead and nose area. With Neutrogena's background, I though my acne days were over but the whole thing backfired! Day 1 and 2 were nice, my skin seemed to be clearing but the next morning, my entire face was covered in pimples. Hoping this was just the middle phase and that after this terrible ordeal was over, I'd finally have clear skin. But no. It only continued to get worse and worse. This was a terrible product. Now, I'm dreaming of the way my skin was before I started. Complete waste of time and money."
3,works,"it works for my skin. the cleanser could be more gentle. It can be harsh on my skin at times especially while using other products. don't tan after using this product, i had a bad skin reaction for almost a week from that :/bottles are small."
5,Works Well,"I received this on March 28th and have been using it since, mornings and nights along with the 2-in-1 toner. There has been a HUGE change in my skin. Yes it does take a while but nothing works overnight so patience is a must. My forehead was covered in bumps, pimples, whiteheads, blackheads and even the post acne marks. Although the marks are still visible, they have faded tremendously. If used correctly, it will definitely last. It has been 2 months and I still have enough left for at least another month. Worth the money. I can't say whether or not it's better than Proactiv because I've never used it but I highly recommend this product. The only thing is it dries out the face A LOT! I use another moisturizer along with the one this comes with with an SPF of 40, so make sure you get another moisturizer with a higher SPF."
3,Great product,I have been using proactiv for a while.But it wasn't doing the job as good as I hoped.So I bought neutrogena advanced solutions complete acne therapy system where I worked.I said if this don't work I was going to the doctor.I tried it and in two days it controlled my very oily skin.Proactiv never done that.My face doesn't look like I smeared grease all over it.I couldn't believe it.And at a great price.I don't have to order it and wait.I can go and get it at any retail store.Way cheaper than proactiv.It cleared my skin in just two days.I understand that it may not work for everyone but it worked for me.I was very pleaseed.Try it.
3,Didn't work for me as fast as they say,"I used this product for 3 weeks. I saw medium results the first week which made me feel super excited; however the next 2 weeks I didn't see any improvement.Because of this, I tried ""Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash"" and combine it with ""Nature's Cure Two Part Acne Treatment System"" and I found that these two products are incredible when used together! I saw big results the first week! Now I have been using them for almost 1 month and my face is almost clear! I only have like 4 small small pimples and before I had my forehead covered with pimples! I highly recommend you to try this combination, but of course keep in mind that what works for me might not work for you!Good luck!"
1,Didn't work for my daughter =(,"I purchased this product for my daughter who is 21. She has developed adult acne. After 4 days of using this, as described, her face is broke out even worse than before using. It just isn't the product for her, i guess. Shipping was fast and packaging was great. I wish it had worked. I wish i could get a refund for the item."
2,Too drying,"This product was way too drying. I have tried other acne products as well with the same results. Dry, red, irritated skin. My skin is normal, not oily, and I live in the southwest, very dry climate. Maybe that's why none of these products work for me.:-("
1,Going back to Proactiv,"I bought this product after 2 years of paying so much for proactiv. I read that it was better. But after four weeks of using it, my face looks terrible. I have acne all around my mouth and forehead. It dried my face out a little but only in certain spots. I was really hoping this would work. I looks like I will keep paying high dollar for proactiv."
4,"Good cleanser, but dried my skin out","I have been using proactive for the past two years, and I liked it, but I wanted to see if I could find a cheaper substitute. This neutrogena set was a really good combo and kept my face looking good, but after two weeks it started drying my skin out. I had to incorporate stronger moisturizers to help compensate, and my face broke out in the process. I have very sensitive skin that dries out easily. I don't think I would suggest this set to people who have a problem with benzoyl perozide because my face had the same reaction to that."
3,not for severe acne,it helped a little but not as much as i hoped. it helped to the point where my acne wasnt huge red sore pimples but didnt get rid of them completely.
3,Not for sensitive/drying skin,"This product cleans my pores well and works great within the first week, but after that my skin started peeling really badly. I even used the lotion only once a day and my skin was still completely flaky. Then my acne started coming back because of all the dry skin on my face. I wouldn't recommend this for those with sensitive or dry skin."
3,MEH,Nothing to special about this set not great not terrible did'nt really do anything for my skin. Maybe just not for me.
2,Dried Out My Skin,"I have used this product for a little over two weeks and so far the results have been terrible. I did the entire system and followed the directions exactly yet after every wash my skin was dried out and stripped of it natural oils. I now have dry patches on my cheeks and chin and I still have acne on my forhead. I tought maybe it was the acne control lotiona that was the problem so I reduced my usage but the cleanser is just as bad, after washing my face and putting on moisturizer the dry patches did not subside. Do NOT waste your money, I am a young African American female with combination skin so I suggest for people in the same boat as I am to look elsewhere."
2,I still got pimples,I bought this product after reading all the great reviews. It didnt completely clear up my skin... and didnt make some existing pimples go away. The moisturizer made my skin feel greasy and look shiny.
4,"Very good, but it may let your skin too dry","I have been using this product for 3 days, I know it is pretty early to draw conclusions its efficacy, but I have to admit I have been quite impressed with the results. The product reduced the appearance of black heads and my skin is less oily and clearer than before. I have noticed, however, that the night cream leaves my skin dry and red. The cleanser and the day time cream are great. I will probably only use the night cream every other night from now on. The product is well priced and very much worth the money."
1,TERRIBLE moisturizer/product in general.,"I'm 16 years old and have been dealing with acne since I was 13, and have tried just about every product. This one was really terrible, I have only used it for 3 days so I'm not sure if it is actually going to clear my acne or not but it has dried out my skin and made it REALLY flaky and the moisturizer is so thin and light weight that it doesn't do a thing. I constantly have a really flaky face all the time now."
5,Only thing that works,"I am in my 30's and get breakouts from stress or when the wind blows. This is the only thing along with my Moroccan (Rhassoul) Ghassoul Lava Clay masks with lemon juice, that work.I absolutely love the oil free lotion. Best stuff hands down.Nov 4th: I also use Sal-3 Salicylic Acid and Sulfur Soap. It dried up all the acne. NCATS is used for maintenance now."
5,Looks good!,I bought this for my teenagers and have seen significant improvement in their skin. Less breakouts = happier kids. Sounds like a deal to me.
2,Ouch!,"I can't really tell actually if it does combat the acne - my face was red and burning after a week of diligent application. I had to stop using it because I really felt I had a serious sunburn. It also dried out my skin severely. If you have sensitive skin this is not for you! And as I said, I'm not sure if it actually did anything for the acne because I had to stop using it after one week and up until then I could not see any significant changes. Aside from redness and burning!"
5,Very Pleasantly Surprised,"I was skeptical at first if this product line would really do the job the same or better than Proactive. The amounts of medication used are less than what's contained in the ""extra strength"" Proactive I'd been using, but which left me with skin so dry I would only apply once a day.I'm really happy I decided to purchase this line when I saw it in the store (convenient and half the price). The cleanser is where you get the salicylic acid and very small gentle beads, the night lotion is where you get the benzoyl peroxide, and the day lotion is included for a nice oil-free spf 15 moisturizer.The overall results are much better than my old regimen. I have clearer skin with much less drying, and I don't have to go through the extra steps of applying an added moisturizer and sunscreen like I used to. I recommend this gentle and effective product, great all-around."
3,"Very cute, but seriously hurt!","I had read that these shoes cut into your feet and rub against your heel, but I did not expect it to be as bad as it is! I had to stop and buy bandaids to put on my feet in the affected areas. It's a shame, because the shoe itself is incredibly cute and I received compliments on them from 5 people in one day. If it weren't for this problem I would have given the shoe a 5.I had also read that the shoe was running small, so I ordered a 7.5 (I usually wear a 7). I had to exchange them for a 7 because they were not running small, and actually, the 7 was still a bit big.As to the color, the leopard ones are more brown-based than black.If you're buying them cheap, I'd say they're worth the money just in looks. However, be prepared to wear bandaids to protect your feet when you wear them!"
4,"I'm Not A Fergie Fan, But. . .","This song is pretty good. It's sounds like a combination of Gwen Stefani's ""Hollaback Girl"" and J-Kwan's ""Tipsy"", two good songs as well. Surprisingly, the song isn't in rotation on my local R&B/Hip-Hop station, but that corny ""Sexyback"" song by Justin is played all the time."
1,Simple Steps to Insanity,"If you ever get bored with your current events in your life and decide you would like to go insane. I invite you to listen to this song. The lyrics are enough to make you start talking to yourself, no kidding. The music itself sounds like a pornographic Disney show tune. The sad part is this ridiculous song is REALLY popular. Contemporary society can't find a solution for global warming, but the London London Bridge is wanting to go down."
1,Sorry..,"But it's time that we demanded a little more from our so-called music artist. I almost get the sense that Fergie just laughing all the way to the bank on this. I think that she was a good addition to the BEP, but if this is a sampling of what to expect from her a solo artist then I rather pass. Plus...what the heck is she talking about?"
1,wow thats preety sad.,"To put it all together this cd suks. I'm surprised they would bother even showing is on mtv. I mean seriously, ""london bridge"" has enough explicit hidden sex messages in it to scare small children. She was only ""OK""( and i stress the word OK) in the black eyed peas and they weren't very good anyway. The only reason i would ever bother watching her is because she is hot. I hope that london bridge(which is not even located in london anymore, it's in Arazona now) falls right on her head."
1,fergie should fall down too,boy beatjacking has alweays been in anyway did'nt the clipse use this beat along witj j kwon and countless others anyway fergie should go into punk rock.
3,"More Flexibility, Please","Hate to give a less-than-stellar review, but this did not quite come up to expectations. I have the Safe-T-Compass to carry in my travel kit, and it's perfect because it works as a compass, is flexible enough that there's no fear of it breaking, and it has no sharp points to worry TSA. My plastic protractor recently broke (from stress in the travel kit), so I bought this item expecting it to be made from the same vinyl-like bendy material as the Safe-T-Compass. Unfortunately, while the design is good and color is the same, the plastic is much more brittle and I doubt it would survive a trip in luggage. I believe this product could (should) be improved by making it from the same material as the Safe-T-Compass, at least for my purposes."
1,too much narratives and not much substances,"i can find these chapters in the IBM manuals too. why do i want to spend $44 for this book while i can get them from the on-line books supplied by IBM ? total waste of money. I have read Brian Fu's AS/400 Control Language Guide, a much better choice."
5,Screenplay resource,I love this book! It has been quite helpful to me with my screenwriting. I really enjoyed reading it and using it as a resource for future screenplays I write.
3,Just stitches,"I obviously did not read the description very well as I thought I'd be getting patterns of things to make, not just stitch samples. I think this book is more for a knitter who modifies existing patterns or who makes up their own designs."
4,bought this for the photos...,"Have been knitting for just a few months and as an artist I wanted a book to spur my imagination. I checked this book out at the library and decided to purchase mainly because of the photos. The instructions included with each pattern are presented with just a chart, so I have been cross-referencing with Barbara Walker's Treasury books. Also, the sections on lace and openwork are FABULOUS! But, it may take some time for me to figure them out as the charts are confusing (remember I'm new to knitting)."
1,"""whip the rebellion""","If u already know the history of GRANT in the CW, this book adds nothing. ZERO. With the provocative subtitle of Grant's rise to command, I expected tactical and strategic analysis and evaluation of grant's development as commander. This is just another rehashed history of Grant's campaigns with a few vignettes thrown in. By the way, it has NO MAPS or PICTURES.USELESS. DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK!"
5,Benefit of the Doubt,"I find it odd that a book that hasn't even been released yet would get any review, much less a one-star review. For that reason, I'm going to give Herotica 7 the benefit of the doubt--and a 5-star review."
4,better with a band not a symphony,"My high school marching band played selections from ""Standing Stone"" last year. Our season was great and it was all due to the music of McCartney. Many of the band members purchased Standing Stone in mid season to hear it first hand, but many did not like it. It wasnt as intriquing as it is when a full band (not orchastra) plays it. The strings should be shoved aside and be replaced by some clarinets. It would have changed the whole mood."
5,The nature of choice in alcoholism,"From the Publisher: In the flood of books and papers about alcoholism since the 1960's, no one has successfully explained the origins of addictive behavior. These efforts continue to fail because they do not define the subject first - the human organism in its environment. Alcoholism is the affliction of an organism choosing at every moment between life and death equivalents. The nature of this choice is illuminated as the author builds on a background of Western thought. Hewitt examines the implications of the new physics on our understanding of human organization, and then applies shame based theories and principles of AA to the dynamics of human negotiations with life and death in our personal environment. Hewitt's thesis may be the most important proposition ever made about the etiology of alcoholism."
1,Premise falls flat,"There is little to recommend this book to either a recovering person or professionals working in the field of recovery. The author spends the first 200 pages or so (it seems much longer) with a disjoined and poorly flowing discussion of 20th century intellectual trends, particulatly Cartesian world view and relativity theory. He attempts to relate this to approaches, thoughts, and trends in recovery, but manages only a tenuous connection at best. His conclusion after all this is alcoholics make a decision to drink, and that their best hope for recovery is to join Alcoholics Anonymous. Not exacly new concepts."
1,Little new to offer,"This book offers little to the recovering person or professionals in the field. The auther spends the first 200 pages or so (is seems much longer) attempting to make a case for ananlysing alcoholism within the context of 20th century intellectual thought, such as the Cartesian world view and relativity theory, then comes to the surprise conclusion that alcoholics can best be served by embracing AA. Hardly a novel conclusion."
1,Worst Dvd,"I have purchased 2 of Kelly's DVD's and i was not impressed with either.I am dumbfounded at the 5 star's given here, half the stuff listed on the box isn't even there. It's not Kelley's fault, but the fault of those who produced those shabby dvd's. I am rating this according to what I expected and what I got. I can't say that i will ever buy another unless I hear it first."
5,Kelly Clarkson,"This is such an amazing DVD.I liked it a lot. She performs really good.It shows how good Kelly Clarkson really is.She is a young , beautiful & has an amazing talent.I just have to say KELLY ROCKS !!!!!!!!!!!"
5,MUST HAVE,if your a fan of kellys this is a must have it has music videos making of music videos performances especially from the 2002 american idol tour and footage of a photo shoot five stars is'nt enough
1,Completely unoriginal,"The least I can say is she is singing a new song and not ripping off someone else's work. However this song just comes off as a Xina Aguilera toss away. The video is nothing new. Clarkson, looking a bit thick around the waist and face, delivers her ""singing."" I'm sure this will sell well since the majority of music buyers wouldn't know taste or originality if it bit them on the behind."
1,will this dvd work on my dvd player as i live in derby thr uk,"need some advice weather to buy this dvd or not, because i think my dvd player is a region 2."
2,Run of the mill,"I was very interested in getting this DVD to see more of what Kelly was all about but was disappointed. I found her charisma lacking. She isn't that pretty to look at -- I'd rather watch Christina or Britney for the look and the moves. Though a good singer, Kelly's style is nothing new, and in fact, falls flat. That is, she is not a standout in today's crowded music scene. Sadly, I found her boring. I thought she may have something more to offer, but I guess from now on, I'll be sticking to Pink, who has an awesome voice, who has an interesting persona and has that something extra."
5,I recommend this book to everyone.,"This book gives very good general tips on designing and decorating your home office. The pictures are beautiful and show a wide variety of styles. The book describes the benefits of different types of furniture. It also gives you sources for where to get the products in the photos.Bonus: It has a section titled ""work-space basics"" which give you tips for floor planning, safety (e.g. outlets and cords), heating and cooling, and security.I recommend this book to any one who is setting up a home office or wants tips to refresh the home office they already have."
5,Love it!,This is one great CD brings back memories and I'm so glad that I have it! This is a must buy!!
1,Terrible sound,I returned this phone. The sound was so bad that I could not understand what anyone was saying.
1,Poor customer service,When I was buying a phone I was perhaps handled by some other company. Good luck with talking to customer service after you are on the contract. Be prepared to be on hold and get transferred between departments and waste precious hours of your life.
2,Not Competative with T-Mobile,Why people buy this plan with this phone? where as T-Mobile is giving same phone with great plans..I really don't understand..Cingular needs to revise their plans to compete with T-Mobile.
5,Cello fix !!!,"I learned about this music watching the incredible DuPre video.The intonation is not always there but there is great feeling and warmth in these interpretations. The recording quality is excellent and one of the two cellos is a strad, very nice tones are on display here.If you are in need of curing a cello fix this is one of the greatest cds you can buy. I was unable to find anyother recordings and the low price should make this cd irresistable to cello fans everywhere. I assure you you will be delighted with this one."
2,ending?,This book has the weakest ending of any book I've ever read and I've read thousands. It lacked resolution. For once I would've liked to see the villian not end up happily ever after.
1,Worst idea ever...,"I purchased this to expand the usefulness of my G3 iBook. I really wish I hadn't. The interchangeable plugs seem like a great idea, but the plug is significantly heavier than the original iBook power adapter's plug. It placed too much strain on the laptop's power port, and eventually caused something internal to snap, leaving me with a G3 paperweight."
1,BAD BAD Printer,"Don't buy a warranty! Its not worth it. Warranties don't cover any consumables. The whole printer is a consumable, except the housing. Consumables don't last even close to what is spec'd.Mine has 46,000 prints and I've spent $4,200.00 on consumables!!! Very bad."
1,"Ok Printing, But hope it does't break!!","I purchased QMS Magicolor 2 printer about 15 months ago (Magicolor 2200 is 2001 version). I use it for printing menus for a restaurant. It worked great for color menu's but not very good with photos.This week the main board went out and the QMS tech said ""Sorry out of warranty"". Called their parts dept and they quoted me a price greater than five hundred dollars for the board. Ouch!I just bought my first set of replacement toner (4) cartridges, one of which is still in the box. I'm real sorry that I bought this printer. It managed to print 3,491 pages. Most of them were B&W.I was hoping that this color laser could replace my deskjet and old laser printers, but now its time to dust off that deskjet and see if I can find my old Epson Action Laser 1500 (7+ years old) to keep my small office running. Tech support was friendly but could not solve this problem with hardware reliability."
1,don't buy this printer,"I've had the Minolta Magicolor 2200 now for 1-1/2 years, and had nothing but trouble. Using it as a network printer (for light duty catalog and flyer printing). Setting up was difficult with spotty technical support. It uses up supplies at an alarming rate, and toner and parts (all consumable, so warranty does not help) are VERY expensive. Printer is also very slow, and print quality varries from average to poor, especially when it comes to color matching and consistency.Worst of all, after only 8,000 copies my fuser part $$ went out. While the book says it should last 100,000 copies, Minolta refused to replace it.I wouldn't buy another Minolta printer again."
1,"DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!MINOLTA RIP OFF!!!","I've owned a MINOLTA 2200 Magicolor for over 1 year. It has been a NIGHTMARE since the purchase of this product. I've owned numerous printers and this is by far the worst. Problems: constant paper jam's in upper rollers, problems with toner (splattering) and the worst is MINOLTA's printer driver software, will not work properly with WINDOWS XP. It is extremly slow to print, it requires at least 3-5 minutes for warm up, when in idle mode requires even longer warm up time. Print quality is good, color is okay- only prints in CMYK. BUYER BEWARE THIS PRINTER IS OVERPRICED JUNK!!!"
1,Minolta QMS 2200,"This machine has been very disappointing, it uses consumables at an alarming rate. Worse than this it offers no warning that the toner or oil roller or drum is about to cease functioning. Thus we have to carry a large stock of consumables. At present I have waited 5 days for an oil roller (weekend & public holiday). The machine is still not operational. There are no local stockists of consumables either. The printer is quite noisy in operation, and depending on the paper tray, where the paper is selected from, is dragging a ghost image from previous print jobs. This I believe could be rectified by myself if I had a spare hour to read the manual. This machine is still under warranty and I only use it if I have to and will replace it as soon as I can afford to. Pity help the person who buys it from me."
1,Expensive piece of junk,"This is the most expensive mistake I've ever made in purchasing computer-related equipment. I paid about $900 when I purchased the Minolta printer new several years ago. I thought I was investing in a read workhorse that would stand me in good stead for many years to come. The fact that you can buy the same printer now for $75 on E-bay should tell you something. In fact I don't see how you could even ship this incredibly heavy and bulky piece of equipment for under the $75 amount.The machine is too noisy to leave running all the time, yet it's time-consuming to boot up when you do shut it down.The numerous consumables (cartridges, oil rollers, drums, etc.) all wear out at a fast rate and they are VERY expensive to replace (as other reviewers have noted).Tech support was virtually non-existent.I'll never buy a Minolta product again."
1,don't move it,"This unit worked well out of the box with a little more than I cared for setup. But, we moved it down the hall to another office and it hasn't worked properly since."
1,Great when it works,"We've had this printer at work for a year now and I absolutely HATE it....Like others, the consumables are ridiculously expensive and did not last anywhere near what was spec'd. We had to replace all the toners after just 1500 copies (cost over $500). Also had to replace waster toner 2x and roller once.Printer is lovely when it works, which isn't often..Most of the time it won't print..Gets stuck in energy saver, even with that function turned off, and generally just sits there doing nothing! We constantly have to restart it (it has a LONG warm-up period!!) Watching print jobs through our server you can see that the machine is receiving the print request, its just not printing it...Customer Service has been no help.Would never buy another Minolta again!!!"
1,I have a ealier version magicolor2,"I'm not going to complain the text quality and speed. However, the color photo print is not as good as a regular inkjet hp printer. What really bother me is the toners are very expensive and quickly run out. Just print out about 3000 pages. It alerts me to replace the black toner. Which cost nearly [money] (due to shipping and tax). If by only replace those four toners, you will spent almost the same price as the new machine with the toners. And nowaday, a black/white laser printer only cost the black toner's price.I rather send away the magicolor2 laser printer and put on a hp inkjet printer in this spot.Right now, I reuse my 10 years old Epson Action Laser printer which can print about 10,000 pages per cartidge.That is my most proud of print I ever have."
3,Compact and Portable,"The Fold-n-Go is cool for it's compactness and large burners. Unfortunately, my first trip with it was to a lake where it turned out to be windy, which is where this stove needs help. I had to improvise a wind shield. Add a folding wind shield to your order and you'll love this stove."
2,Okay stove - does not cook fast,"Pots/pans sit very high above the flame, which makes boiling water or cooking take a very long time. You will go through more propane to cook."
4,Small and easy to carry,"Camping on Assateague island with constant winds the stove did well. If you put it on the ground as opposed to table top, it helps. Otherwise the fact that you can put a regular frying pan on top is a big plus."
5,Great fo Home Or camping,Easy to carry or store also easy to ship . Never be without a way to cook again weather traveling or in a emergancy like Sandy or Earthquick no more cold meals.
2,What a heartbreaker!,"With it's folded compactness and large cooking area for large pots, I thought this would be the perfect stove for our little Toyota motor home, but outdoor cooking with the slightest breeze is impossible. I had to take it inside to finish cooking a small batch of scrambled eggs. The controls are a little difficult to adjust too. Lowering the flame to a simmer is tricky at best."
2,One Problem,"This has been a nice compact heater to keep in the boat for shore lunches, however I have a problem with how long it takes to heat-up the cooking oil. The grill stand-off from the burner is too high, so much of the heat is lost between the burner and the frying pan. I will need to design a grate that gets the pan closer to the fire, otherwise it needs to be on ""high"" to effectively heat up the oil, and that means a lot of propane tanks."
2,Great Stove - if you have a lot of time to wait for coffee,"Great stove - if performance doesn't count but appearance and portability does. The stove performs well indoors, and it even does a good job outside when its warm and there is no breeze. However, on one camping trip the wind was blowing and even though I blocked the wind with crates and crate covers, it took about 45 minutes to boil 3 quarts of water. That was on a warm day. On one recent morning near Tucson, when air temperature was around 40 degrees and a light breeze chilled the air, it took about 30 minutes to bring my coffee water to a boil, not more than a 1 quarts.Considering that I could have boiled that water in under 10 minutes with my old Coleman white gas stove, I'm ditching this one."
2,needs a wind shield,"This was a gift. All in all I think I would have preferred the more traditional Coleman stove. This had very easy setup and was compact - perfect for car camping. But It does not have a wind shield. We just used it for the first time and had to do a makeshift wind shield of boxes and other items - not the safest thing to have next to your stove. I actually am on Amazon right now looking for a compatible wind shield. If i can't find one I'll go to the hardware store and buy some sheet metal and make one.Otherwise I really like the stove. Compact, easy to set up & disassemble quickly. But a wind shield is *so* important!"
5,Everything nature can offer (and More),All I can say is that they were a gift for my wife and she hasn't taken them off since. That's what I call a Happy Anniversary!!!AAA Quality Round 6.5-7mm Akoya SaltWater cultured White Pearl Earrings with 14K Yellow Gold Mount
3,Speechless,"*December 6, 2008 review* Wow, these pearls are so Beautiful! 2nd time i bought jewelery online. Holding them for a special someone.*Jan. 5, 2012* I forgot to update this review. I keep the jewelery in the their original box safe and sound, never touched. Then in Dec. of 2010 i gave these to my girlfriend. Within a month the pearl unmounted from the gold. She was very sad and disappointed."
3,Looks Can Be Deceiving,On first glance these earrings are lovely however after a few months the pearls separated from the gold mounts. Not the best craftsmanship.
3,Nice pearls BUT very small - do not look expensive and quality ones,"The pearls are fine, but the clip on the stud is TOO small. They look very fragile and I am afraid of getting they damaged just by taking them off and putting them on. (I do this every night before going to sleep, so I do wonder how long will they last).Actually if you are looking for good pearl earrings I am sure you can go to store so you can see them before. If you are ordering online may be you just want a pair of earrings to wear on a daily basis... honestly I made a mistake I would have bought a cheaper set, that might look pretty much the same, but if they do break I can replace them without suffering for the new expenditure. hope this help you either way to make up your mind!"
3,Love the Leopard print!,"Delivered very quickly,love the pattern,material is not that great but it's okay. It was the only Leopard cover I could find."
4,Very Helpful,"Like a lot of people, I have flirted with the idea of writing the great American novel. However, a while back, I realized it might be easier to write non-fiction. So, if you have an idea for book and maybe an outline, this comprehensive book explains how to pitch and sell that idea before you put pen to paper - so to speak. I recommend it."
5,Underrated bootleg starts to get credit,"With Seattle I just finishing behind Seattle II in sales, it looks like its finally getting the credit it deserves. Disregard Eddie's comments about the crowd on this one - the bootleg is about the music, not the crowd, and the music rocks. This show contains the best and most aggressive versions of Breakerfall, Whipping and Do The Evolution that I've heard so far. Timeless Melody with Supergrass is pretty amazing, as is Parting Ways with the string section. Every fan should own a copy of Crown of Thorns, so if you don't have Las Vegas then you should buy this one. This was definately one of the best setlists that Pearl Jam put together in their 72 show tour. Combine that with the fact that Eddie's voice was at his peak around this show and this Seattle I becomes a must-buy."
4,excellent rythm section!,"This cd has amazing drumwork by Matt. Sometimes Mccready is drowned out by Gossard , maybe it's the mix. But then again he sounds good on most of the songs. This is a powerfull record with very energetic takes. I think Ben Cramer's review gives you a good idea of this bootleg...."
5,Fantastic Book,Sure this book is basic but it is fabulous for those of us who are not the best decorators....bakers....etc. There are many books out there that I am afraid to attempt the ideas but this one is GREAT!! Thanks Betty Crocker. I am so excited to make so many of the cakes and cupcakes in this book.
2,dissapointed,"I thought this book would have some really nice looking ideas and info. It is a ""cute"" book more for beginners... I wasn't happy with the substance."
2,Decorating with candy,"I was disappointed in this book. It looked cute and I thought it would have some great ideas for cupcakes - specifically for Valentine's Day & my son's birthday. Most of the decorating in this book is using candy instead of frosting which isn't my thing. If you want easy decorating using candies, this book is for you. If you are wanting to expand your cake decorating library, maybe pick another book."
3,Emlyn Williams stars as the refined Chinaman . . .,". . . but the dvd case fails to name him. He also wrote the script, after D. W. Griffith's classic Broken Blossoms (1919), in turn based on a short story, The Chink and the Child (1915). This 1936 British film is a first class production, but of course the story looks simplistic to us now. Congrats to Alpha Home Entertainment for turning up this rarity for dedicated movie lovers."
3,strainer description,The title for the shallow and deep strainer/baskets are intermixed. this is a shallow basket which needs some constraint below it in the drain. I really wish they made a deep 1 3/8 basket for the drain.
5,jULIO AT HIS BEST,"THIS WAS A GIFT FOR MY STEPFATHER, AND BOY DID HE LOVE IT IT BRINGS HIM BACK TO EARLIER TIME WHEN HE WAS GROWING UP."
5,Prefect watch,Bought as a gift and she loved it! There is no one else with this watch which makes it that more special! Thanks again!
3,Hard to see the date,"I love Fossil watches, and this particular model is beautiful. I get compliments all the time. You can't really tell from any of the pictures, but the faceting does make it difficult to read the date."
5,"A favorite for naturalists, gardeners and armchair travelers","Some people astonish and interest us by the miles they've coverage and breadth of things they have seen, people they've met. Edwin Way Teale does the same thing by traveling widely and deeply in a small area, namely the old Connecticut farm he purchases with his wife Nellie. Teale's accounts of the land reveal a caring and complex way of seeing the amazing diversity and miracles all around us. I grew up in the country, but from college on have lived in cities and lost that way of seeing. Teale is a non-preachy anecdote to this forgetting and poetic reminder to slow down and pay attention to what you find when you take the time to look down at the dew drops on leaves or up at hawks circling in the night sky. I keep this book by my bed and read from it at random every night. Above all, don't miss his adventures with mice and woodchucks in the hammock!"
4,A Fun Read; Ready to Read the Next Volume,"I've got nothing in common with Cece Caruso except that we're both Italian, but I found this first story about mystery writer biographer Caruso fun and the mystery suitably convoluted. Cece's flip descriptions of her life and loves are lively and amusing, her travels through the California countryside appealing, and she has an interesting assortment of friends. Her clothing obsession and constant descriptions of such are a bit dull to me, but then, hey, everyone collects something; Cece's thing is just clothing. Looking forward to the second book!"
2,I Dreamed Of A Better Book,"I thought this book had promise- I liked the premise, thought the title was cute, and the PARADE magazine in the Sunday paper had recommended the follow up book ""Not A Girl Detective"". However, I was disappointed to find myself having a hard time getting into this book. The plot was good, but the writing was not very captivating, and the characters were likeable, but not overly engaging. I'd give it two and a half stars to be exact."
3,If you like Janet Evanovich....,"Move over Stephanie Plum. Kandel's heroine, Cece, is Italian (in name only) instead of Polish; but she's got big hair, she's tall and her boyfriend is a policeman. Well, if the formula works, why change it? Cece has left New Jersey for West Hollywood and she's prettier than Ms. Plum,and thinner,too. But, like Stephanie, Cece lives on a diet of junk food.The mystery is solved and the culpable meet their fate all in the space of two pages. Considering the book is 280 pages long, she could have dragged out the climax for a few more pages. Unlike Evanovich, the prose doesn't ring true. Evanovich manages to make the most outlandish characters seem plausible--maybe because she feeds into our dearly-held stereotypes. Kandel always seems to be trying to hard to make her characters loveable eccentrics, but they aren't believable for a minute. Still, I couldn't put the book down."
2,A Bit Slow,"The story itself was a good idea. However, it moved a bit slow for my taste. I found myself thinking I would never get to the end. I don't like to give away anything for those who might enjoy it more than I, so I won't go into the details of the storyline. I will wait for the second book to be released in paperback, that is if I decide to give it another try. I like to think the kinks are being worked out in a first book, so I usually read 2 before giving up completely. I think it takes great courage and skill to put a book together, kudos for those brave enough to try."
4,I Love Cece.,"I moderate a monthly mystery book club at a neighborhood library in Houston, Texas and this was our January book. I enjoyed this book on several levels, as I am a retired attorney as well as an avid mystery reader. My group of 28 this month thoroughly enjoyed the book, for both the main character of Cece and for the insight on Erle Stanley Gardner. In a week when Robert P. Parker has died, it brought back how so much was owed to Parker, who in turn owed much to Gardner."
3,Open the window and let me breathe,"This is, more or less, the ""complete"" Bang Records recordings by Van Morrison. Disc one features all his studio masters, plus the demo of ""The Smile You Smile"" and an alternate take of ""Brown Eyed Girl"". Disc two features 31(!) very brief non-songs where Van wastes studio time goofing around. On these tracks, Van is alone with his acoustic guitar, and he ususally just repeats a line or two over and over for about a minute. This is amusing for a ""song"" or two, but it gets pretty tedious after a while. But the main attraction here is the first disc. Van himself reportedly didn't care much for these recording sessions, feeling that they were overproduced. He may be right in some cases, but ""Brown Eyed Girl"" is an undeniable classic. The rest of the material is hit and miss. This is an interesting look at the beginning of a legendary career."
2,"First cd's an ok compilation, second's a joke","The first cd's another van morrison compilation, good songs you probably already have. The second cd i'm pretty sure was meant as a joke or just messing around in the studio. The like 6th song is even ""if you made it this far it's freaky""Try another compilation or a remaster :)--Alex"
4,Curiouser and Curiouser.,"A young lady loses her parents in a terrible accident. Unfortunately, she is in for a second awful shock when she discovers that her father lived well beyond his means. While living with a distant Aunt, she decides that she needs her independence and takes a job as a waitress in a local restaurant. Unfortunately for her, she notices some very peculiar things about her Aunt's behaviour. However, luckily for her, Perry Mason is one of her restaurant customers and she is able to interest him in the case before she gets in over her head.I'm always a big fan of Perry Mason. Gardner cooks up some of my very favorite comfort novels. The Case of the Worried Waitress (1966) isn't one of his best. The plot jumps around a bit too much. Somehow both Della Street and Hamilton Burger are pale presences here. Still, the snappy dialogue and well-written prose keep it entertaining and well worth the time to read."
2,Backbone Of The Wehrmacht The German K98K Rifle 1934-1945,"Just a great first attempt, but now very dated. Richard Law was a great guy, a personal friend, and his book was the first to explore the Mauser Kar98k rifle in depth, however, that was over 21 years ago and much of the data presented is at best dated and at worse fatally flawed, with much misinformation presented as fact. Richard Law has been dead for many years and there is no chance the book will be corrected and/or updated. There are 2 new books on this very weapon available now to the general public. I strongly suggest you take the time to look before you invest your money in what is now a terminally flawed and outdated book."
2,"Some interesting photos and info but production numbers,places and rarity are fubar!","Alot of the stuff in this book have been proven false, in general production factories and how they were produced which this book goes into great(and sometimes extremely boring) detail is correct. There were pictures but not as many as one would like.I collect k98s, im not a major collector but I know what im doing so when i say if you get this book, take it with a grain of salt. Alot of the info is now faulty now that the market has been flooded with Russian Captures and other eastern front rifles being sold in the states.Its a good starters book but I suggest you get it at the library, its not worth $50 in my opinion."
1,"Not Swiss (or USA), Not ""tech"", Not working ...","These are really cute. Not in a good way. Smaller than i thought. Broke in my hand while trying to use as pliers on a simple task. Screw drivers akward to use because you are trying to spin tiny open pliers on its end while pushing downward. It is better than nohing, if stranded, in the wilderness, with no hope of finding a shreds metal to be used as improvised tools. They are shiny though."
1,Not sure if its 1 star or 5,"I was at a yard sale being given by a community-based provider where I purchased a suitcase set where inside I found this tool. I have been using this tool for everything including computer repairs and I cant say enough about it.The only problem is that the tool that I have doesn't match the tool that is being shown here exactly. The one I save is identified as being a ""Swiss-Tech U.S.A"". But the markings dont match the one presented. Furthermore, the one I have has a diagonal marking in the center of the rivit ""LKL"". The tool that I have in my hand wouldn't fall apart even if one tried. The tool I have also isn't shiny.Maybe what I have is a prototype because in my opinion, the engraving on the one shown here compared to the one I have looks cheep. I will keep mine thank you very much."
3,"Bought it, lost it, didn't replace it","Looks cool. Small and solid. Interesting folding mechanism. Grabs your key ring. Teeny pliers and screwdrivers.Whoops! Too small. Too flexy. Too hard to use. Falls off the key ring. Gets lost.Nope, not again."
4,The Essential Guide to Highland Games,A fun and interesting book to read for those with some familiarity of Highland Games. It gives a unique view of a portion of Scottish history that is being kept alive and growing in the U.S. as well as Scotland today. Great information on all forms of athletic events and their history. Many that aren't played in the U.S. but interesting to read about all the same. While the list of games in the U.S. is out of date it's no problem because contacting most of the games listed will update you to many more being played all over the world today.
2,Kind of useless (and missing stuff),"I just returned to Philly after 7 years away and am living in a new (to me) part of the city. I thought this would be a great book to refresh my city savvy. Nope! I learned more in a few days than this book had to offer. In fact, it was missing some really important info. (for example, a great part was left off the map and not mentioned in the text). I say ""waste of money."""
4,Beginners guide to philly.....,Great pocket size book for those new to the Philly area. Mainly covers center city and nearby areas. I loved this guide when I first moved to Philly!
2,Nothing new for companies with a decent web presence.,"Unless your website is still being made by your cousin ""who knows a little about this internet thing"" there is nothing new for you in this book.Most of what is presented is common sense, heavy on the why but not the how, and very repetitive. Real life examples are limited and center around the finance industry. My search for a resource to inspire designers take usability to the next level continues and this book is being returned."
2,Bitter and Cranky,"Mordden's other musical history books are so informative and entertaining. This one is angry, bitter, cranky, condescending, and not terribly well written. The book's organization is messy at best, his right-wing politics needlessly intrusive, and his opinion of current musical theatre offensive and closed-minded. In fact, the musial theatre is healthier, more exciting, more inventive than at almost any other time in history. At what other time did we have brilliant experiments like Urinetown, Bat Boy, Songs for a New World, The Last Five Years, Avenue Q, A New Brain, Euphoria, Dream True, A Light in the Piazza, etc.? Mordden is just a fuddy-duddy who can't see what a glorious time this is for the art form."
3,scarred pan/dented lid,"I received the pan today and was disappointed to see that the lid was dented on the inside and the pan itself had a spot where the nonstick was flaked off. It's such a hassle for me to return items, and this one is heavy. I don't understand why items are not checked for defects. If the pan did not have defects, I think I would love it."
2,Coating easily scratches,"I bought this pan about a year ago. 6 months prior, I had also bought a much cheaper Analon pan. Surprisingly, the Analon pan has held up so much better. This calphalon pan has a bunch of scratches. I'm so surprised because I am VERY careful with the pan, only ever using heat-resistant plastic or wooden utensils. And still not a single scratch in the Analon pan. I wipe the pan clean and don't use anything abrasive or even soap.It's too bad because the size and shape is great. I still use it a lot, but I'm disappointed that it sticks more, especially in those crevices. I think I'll go look for an analon pan in this size as a replacement."
4,10 Inch Size Limited Use,"Regarding quality, ease of use and clean up it's everying it claimed to be. I'm very pleased with the purchase. I'm single and so cooking for one I find the 10 inch size to be adequate. However, if it were for a family purchase or cooking for two or more, I would recommend a larger size."
1,Wrong movie,"This is NOT the Reygadas version, but rather a cartoon version of the Sleeping Beauty in Spanish. Will be returning and contacting Amazon."
2,Wanted to like it!,"I really hate to give a low review, because this SHOULD have been one of my favorite books. I love reading about journals and seeing other's journals but just found most everything in here boring. I enjoyed the glimpse at Lynda Barry's pages, but it was all too brief. Danny Gregory's Illustrated Journals book is a much better choice-you get to hear from the artist's and get a good look into their journals. I turn to that book again and again...I only wish that was how I felt about this."
2,What's the point?,"This book features photographs & a couple of sample pages from a select & varied group of people - some are artists, some are other professions. I thought the book would be an inspiration for journaling - I did not find it so. Many of the photo pages are unreadable and uninspiring. Felt it was a waste of time and money."
5,For Your Inspiration-no technique included but visually very pleasing,This book is a great glimpse into how people from different fields treat their journals. From putting them up on a pedestal to utilitarian jotting down of memos and thoughts.If you are looking for techniques this book does not have them. If you are looking for inspiration-this book certainly has it. The dimensions of the book is also quite nice as is the weight of the papers within. Includes a great variety of contributors-now I just want to see the rest of their personal journals.I received this as a gift for Christmas and I think I have looked at it every day since. I would recommend this for a gift for yourself or family and friends.If you love love looking at journal arts this is a book worth putting in your rotation.
1,Not a good buy from this vendor,"This particular version of the DVD was not good. The quality was ok but it said, 'Not for sale' or some such wording on the cover and this message continued to pop up here and there throughout the movie as we were viewing it. I have seen the movie before, so I know it's a good movie. It's just that the version this vendor sent me (I picked the least expensive one which should have been a red flag I suppose) I could not recommend by any means."
2,"Bad acting, bad ping-pong","A generally horrible experience throughout. The lead character in this film was such an unlikeable, disrespectful, trash-talking punk, we were wishing there was some way that he and the sleazy villain character could both lose in the final showdown. The rest of the cast was humorous and talented, but the plot line of punk reluctantly being pulled into his ethnic heritage only to revert back to punk wasn't particularly creative or amusing. Also the quality of ping-pong by all the ""playas"" in the movie was unbelievably inept and fake. Add incessant rap music throughout to make the misery complete. If I didn't like ping-pong, I never could have sat through this dud."
3,funny,This was a funny funny funny funny funny funny funny funn funny funny funny funny funny funny funny funny movie.T
2,Fail.,Racist film. Chinese playing the victim against white oppression. Lots of comments against whites and minorities need to stick together. Bad influence for teen target audience.
5,Good movie,"Good movie. Recommended for a date or family time. Well-played stereotypes but nothing is offensive. It is a comedy uses ping pong as a focus point, but not a serious sports movie."
4,Very funny...,"Loved the movie. Although I'm Indian and not an Asian American, I enjoyed the movie and I could relate to a lot of aspects around 2nd generation immigrant culture in this movie."
5,Brilliantly dark humor with a focus on relationships,"Dibdin is, in my opinion, what the mystery genre needs; a quality literature writer who happens to use mystery as an excuse to tell his story. His humor is deliciously dark and at times shocking. What sets him apart is his focus on relationships. The solution to the mystery is not nearly as important as how the characters interact. Dibdin deserves much more respect than we Americans have given him. Dibdin is what mystery should be. I also recommend the Aurelio Zen series for a ""detective"" with a distinctly melancholy personality."
2,"All red herrings, no meat","It's a cute story with a circuitous trail of red herrings used to reach a different end to a non-mystery story. The writing is good, but the story is Dibdin-lite."
3,"Good, not great","Concur with the other reviewers for the most part. The price is hard to beat, and the cooking properties sold me on the line enough to buy the higher-priced 1.5qt saucepan.My only gripe is specific to this stir-fry pan: the flat bottom is small, so given the shape of the sides and the long, heavy handle, the pan does not sit flat on a ceramic cooktop. I get around this by just propping it up, but it is a serious flaw, particularly since they explicitly claim it's well suited for ceramic cooktops."
2,Not very satisfied.,It is sticky and heavy. I don't think it's a worthy buy considering the price....
1,Bad product!!!!!Very bad!,"In this product Features list, it stated as "" ...with infused anodized technology provides nonstick interior..."" It sticks! even sticks when I made omelet!!! This is a super stick!!!!!!!!"
1,I hate it !!,"1. super stick!!!washed it thoroughly with hand and warm water,never heat it with very high temperature,try to use more oil--still stick!! all over the place2. does not sit flat on a ceramic cooktop3. after 2 days, the price decreased from 49 to 39! angrying~~~~~If I can,I just wanna give nonstar!"
4,Maybe Trying A Little Too Hard,"This is really a musically ODD disc. It's far less melodic than anything Malkmus (& co.) have done so far (and, unfortunately, far less lyrically clever --did someone else in Pavement write the words?) The best way to describethe music is to compare it to the work of jazz musician Dave Brubeck (to whom Malkmus paid apparently-sincere homage with the song ""5-4=Unity"" on the album ""Crooked Rain."") I find myself admiring the musicianship and the complexity of the arrangements, but overall there's a sort of....overworked quality to this that makes it a little hard to really get into."
4,"Better than his last, but not as good as his first","At first listen I thought this was decent. It then grew on me. I like it! There are some Malkmus gems like ""penny smart but dollar dumb."""
2,Mama's in the kitchen with tripe,"OK, ""tripe"" is a bit much, but am I the only Malkmus fan who doesn't like this record? I'm hoping it will grow on me, but as yet, I'd rate it as so-so. Of course any SM fan will appreciate the old-school dark jams of tracks 2 and 6. And I suppose SM should get credit for working with a danceable beat for once in ""Kindling for the Master"", but the balance of the record is either boring or just plain annoying. That ""Mama's in the kitchen with onions"" song is the ""Carrot Rope"" of ""Face the Truth"" - i.e., inexplicably bad, incongruous and irritating. I really didn't expect to be disappointed by this one, but I am."
2,Face The Truth...The truth about this ablum,"To me a five star album is Slanted & Enchanted, Crooked Rain x 2, and Wowee Zowee comes close. Standing this album up next to those three incredible accomplishments from the golden era of this genius song writer leaves one wishing that he'd try a little harder. Having seen his performance at sxsw in 2005 and having given this album a couple of listens I'm left only to conclude that Stephen Malkmus doesn't put much heart or soul into his music anymore. This guy is so good though that I'm sure he can come out with an album like this (which does have good song writing craft) without too much strain. What is missing from this album is the passion, raw energy, and the brilliant unpredictableness that his earlier works contained. The form is there, but I'm just not convinced that anything else is."
2,poor,"This is not a good album folks. Yes 'it kills' me to say it. This is the weakest thing he's done yet. If you want great Malkmus solo, buy his first solo album, second buy Pig Lib, third, dont buy this album. The weird songs are horrible (1,3, 8) and the rest are boring except track 7. Did he call in Steve Vai on No More Shoes? Terrible."
3,prog is the new indie,"as he's an undeniable genius, SM will always be worth lending a ear to. the mess of this is, everyone WANTS to like it so much(look at the EXPECTATIONS Spoon, for instance, have met with, given the over-uber-hype of their new thing--it's just more ornately produced, not better songwriting or more inventive arragements). ""Face the Truth"" will grow on you--it only takes two listens or so--but you may not really want it to: especially if you still pine for Pavement (i.e. it just makes you want to put on ""Slanted"" or ""Crooked."" the inscrutability of SM's lyrics (a good thing!) is ill-served by having them printed out--i prefer the mystery. don't get me wrong--this record's ""nice""; it just won't change your world or anything. check out, by the way, the new Go-Betweens or anything by the black watch.death to Interpol and their ilk! death!!!!!"
1,Arthur Clarke,I was disappointed with this video. Arthur Clarke is shown interviewing people. I thought the video was about Arthur Clark talking about his theories on ESP. One thing I got from the video is the book Clarke read that got him into ESP. I then ordered it on Amazon.
4,A nice gift to offer your better half,"I bought this for Christmass and it really looks very nice, it could be used with a long or short chain for different ocasions and my wife really likes it. The price is very good for something with a gem too."
3,Order and disorder,"Hélas! Plus d'un mois après avoir commandé ce produit (vendu par Amazon.com, LLC, je ne l'ai toujours pas reu. More than one month after my oder, it is still not arrived. (Sold by Amazon.com, LLC)"
1,Poor educational value,"I bought this toy to demonstrate the working of an automotive gearbox to my 12 year old daughter (she was doing a school project).I found the model very clumsy to assemble (or maybe that was just me!), and also realized that you could do only one ratio at a time! So once assembled, it was tough to show various gear ratios and how that change is done!Also, it was just too small -- very tough to use this as a demonstration piece as well. I am unable to understand how this is even called a toy!Anyhow, I ended using pieces of the model (gears separately, shafts separately etc) to create my own crude example of how things work in a real gear box!"
4,She deserves to be better known,"If you listen to Suzanne Vega and /or Jewel, you have to listen to Sophie Zelmani. I'm sure you will fall in love with her folk rock ballads/ mid tempo songs and her innocent voice. For some people ""Sing and Dance"" might lack of upbeat tracks. I find this relatively slow pace mesmerising. Her albums have all that classic and timeless feeling.""How's your heart doing"", ""Going home"", ""People"", ""Moonlight"" are perfect examples of the immediate familiar feeling you get when listening to Sophie. I would like to highlight ""Once"", the beautiful duet with Freddie Wadler, another Swedish singer. The title track is a litle bit more upbeat and country folk. ""Yes I am"" is an instant sing along.When I purchased her first album I had never heard about her. I listened to it three times, and since I'm chasing her further releases&#65533; Wanna bet with me you will soon be singing & dancing with her too?"
5,rare pleasure to listen !,"It's a remarkable album made by extremely talented woman. This album filled with mellow ocean of dreams, feelings and desires. I love all the album's songs but title song most of all. Thank you, sophie."
3,"Loudness is a good band, but they were in rush..maybe.","If you ever heard the album LIVE-LOUD-ALIVE, you know the loudness (with the vocalist Minoru Nihara) was one of the best Heavy Metal Bands around the world in 80's. They are still playing very well in this album 8186 LIVE, but it make me think that they must've been in hurry to make this live album. After the success of their first album for the world market THUNDER IN THE EAST, they maybe wanted to make more success on the next album LIGHTNING STRIKES. They probably wanted advertise for that. 8186 LIVE contains most songs from the LIGHTNING STRIKES even though they have more of much better songs from their previous albums. And, Minoru Nihara is getting tired at the end of the track, and Akira Takasaki put unnecessary classical music notes on the his own guitar solo time. However they are one of the most skillful members. This is a enjoyable album, somehow.."
4,Beautiful!!,My wife loves these earrings.The only downfall is that they don't have screw on backs.These are beautiful earrings.Thanks for a nice product.
2,Sterling Silver Engraveable HeartTag Charm Pendent,"Wasn't pleased with this item because jewelry stores don't want to engrave unless te product is bought from them. Everywhere I tired it was the samething, sorry you did not purchase from us. But the Heart was nice, just not what I had wanted."
5,"The Best, period!","After trying numerous curries over the years both here and in India I confidently assert ""This is the best curry powder of them all"". Hey, the British governor thought it was the best and so do I! I have been more than 10 times in India and spent years on end there. My western tongue votes for this brand. It's the most aromatic and flavorful without burning your mouth. Many curries just have a lot of chili in them to conceal the bad food ingredients but have no real flavor, this one is not one of them. And, the price isn't bad either, 2-3 times higher than you can buy it for in Bombay right now at Rs127 ($2.88). That's what it says right on the can I picked up in Bombay recently!"
1,Dreadful,The book was confusing and dreadful. The only thing I can say good about it is that it mentioned places in Minnesota I am familiar with.
5,Just get it done!,"This is a brilliant documentary of the trials and trials behind the release of the excellent 'Firecracker'.Steve and Clark Balderson are an absolute inspiration to watch. The belief they have in themselves and their ability to recognise the Hollywood crap in an instant is remarkable.With their hearts on their sleeve, these men are dedicated to achieving their vision in their way. Nobody knows their film better than they do. So why the heck should anybody else dictate how their film should be released?"
3,does anyone know if this is durable?????,no one has made a review and the price is pretty low so I was wondering if anyone knew how durable they are?
2,NOT FOR BIGGER KIDS!!!!,"I bought this set for my two daughters, ages 4 and 7. It is cute enough, and comes with a lot of items, but it is WAAAAAAAY smaller than the picture shows. My 4 year old told me it was too short for her to play with, and she is on the smaller side. Plus, it is very flimsy. Overall, I think the Disney one at Toys R Us is a much better cart."
4,"Good ""vehicle"" for toddler boy or girl","My grandson, a 21/2 yr old, enjoys serving tea to his dinosaurs. And when he needs to expand energy, he gleefully pushes the cart through the kitchen-family room-hallway ""racetrack"". The cart & teaware are reasonably sturdy. However, the pretend boxes of cookies, sugar & milk are flimsy. Also, the lid to teakettle did not fit properly & we removed it to eliminate frustration. The tea trolley can double as a shopping cart or stroller for wheeling around stuffed animals. The trolley is taller in height for older toddlers who no longer need to use it as a bottom-heavy stabilizing push toy. All in all, it is a good toy for imaginative play."
5,fun toy,My grandaughter loves this toy. The teapot makes sounds of boiling water and pouring it into a cup. The only thing that I find wrong with it is that the handles come out pretty easily. I had to glue them in to keep them from comming out every time she tried to lift the cart up. Other than that it is a hit.
2,Tolerable at best,"While this textbook vintage British mope rock can hold appeal for fans of nostalgia (as you can practically smell the encased atmosphere scenesters would have engaged at that time and place) in the here and now most material has a hard time escaping parody, let alone a plodding nature."
2,Problems with trying to lower ph this way,"I've learned that if your water has buffering agents, that are meant to keep the ph stable, trying to lower with this product won't work. I've tripled the dose and still can not get the water near 7.0. Despite what the bottle says, that if you have very hard water you ""may need to double"" the dose. Just be cautious with this product. Big swings in ph can be harmful to fish, and keeping ph stable may not work with this product, depending on your water properties. Water here in the Southwest, is 8.4ph. If you have a smaller tank, it is better to do water changes with RO water you can buy from a water machine, that will have lower ph than mess with chemicals to make that happen."
1,Great Good Places if You're Our Kind of People,"Another reactionary bewailing the loss of ""community,"" by which he means places where white heterosexual male Republicans can pretend no one else exists. No celebration of diversity here! There is an insulting prediction that a proliferation of ""great, good places"" would eliminate the horrible problem of the existence of gay people. People of color are not mentioned at all, so one presumes they have already ceased to exist. No religious, ethnic, or linguistic minorities, no immigrants, no poor people, just smiling happy faces greeting cronies over coffee. It is astounding that such insensitivity exists in this day and age."
4,"Interesting, if unfocused","Oldenburg's scholarship here is a little fuzzy -- while I found myself agreeing with many of his points, much of his evidence seemed anecdotal. His cross-cultural comparisons were interesting: the French cafe and the Austrian coffeehouse are institutions that seem, well, very foreign to Americans.There are no substantive mentions of hair salons or bookstores in this work. I'm not sure how they slipped into the title.On the whole, this work raises interesting questions about the decline of public life and public space in American culture. Oldenburg throws a number of darts at the suburbs and poor urban planning, but seems to spend more time lamenting the lost innocence of small-town America than thinking about the future and how things could be turned around. There's a lot of thought-provoking material here, and I think this work represents a good jumping-off point for further consideration and research."
4,Rich and spicy!,"Numi's rich organic rooibos, a healthy antioxidant packed, naturally caffeine-free herbal tea, is the base for this spicy potion. The primary flavor is cloves but the cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, allspice and rooibos add to the blend to make a harmonious, tasty and soothing brew--particularly with cream!Rooibos is known for its caffeine-free health benefits. It is loaded with natural anti-oxidants--natures anti-aging tonic, and has been used to cure insomnia in Africa.Numi gets points for their manufacturing process and packaging. The boxes containing their tea is made from 100% recycled paperboard from 100% post-consumer waste--they assert that by using such packaging materials they save 2,040 trees, reduce landfill by 131,200, and prevent 184,000 greenhouse emissions. Numi uses only 100% natural ingredients without added oils or ""natural flavorings""."
4,small correction to editorial information,"Actually, this product contains rooibos, which is not the same plant as the one which ""normal"" (black, green, earl grey, etc) tea comes from. I like rooibos, but haven't tried this chai yet."
5,A beginner's outlook on resistance band workout,"I'm not a flexible person, but this looked like a good way into resistance band workout.It uses gentle, flowing moves and I was able to go at my own pace, varying the resistance by moving my hands on the band. I definitely was stretching and using muscles that I ordinarily don't. And after only a few sessions am noticing improvement in flexibility. I am not as tight as I was before.The video looks very gentle, but I find myself winded by the end.I'd recommend this for any beginner. Just remember to keep a towel under your head or rear end as you do."
5,One of the best books I ever read,"This is one of the best books I ever read. It is amazing, what an impact a book can have on people. 'Desires in conflict' helped me so much to understand where I was standing and how I got there. There is a way out of homosexuality! You are not born like that! And this book shows you clearly what you can do to fight it! I think this should be the first book to read if you want more information about homosexuality and how to overcome it."
5,Lightning out of a clear sky,"I wept heavily and joyfully while reading this book. In it, I learned more about myself than any other modern psychology book I've read. It is written for the Christian struggler, a perspective that was not I found to be helpful and life saving. His advice is difficult but he provides good Scripture based explanations. There are no words to describe my love of this book and my admiration for its brave author. Thank Heaven for Joe Dallas!"
1,thumbs down,This book was sent to me by a family member trying to 'help'. I found it to be extremely insulting and manipulative. Try Mel White's Stranger at the Gate for the other side of the story -- the enormous harm that can be caused by ex-gay counseling and the dangerous wounds that sort of movement can inflict upon a family. There is a difference between supporting and rescuing. Human beings need support and love to flourish. Rescue the helpless but support those you love.
1,Unscholarly work,"This title by Mr. Dallas is yet another example of his lack of theological though (or training), his lack of scholarly training in exegesis, and his lack of love for all of God's people. As a biblical language scholar and a theologian I find nothing redeeming and nothing of truth in this title or any title by Mr. Dallas."
2,"Not much volume-dry,flavorless popcorn","When searching for premium popcorn for the Little Bambino popcorn popper we won, I bought a red popcorn just for fun. I'm sorry I did.The kernels of Wabash Valley Farms Vintage Red popcorn were stale. They were dried out.You can't directly control the moisture locked in the dry kernels; only the manufacturer can. If there is not enough, the kernels don't pop big enough, they stop popping early, there are a lot of unpopped kernels, and the whole batch burns while you wait for the final slow pops. Popping produces steam, which prevents burning. No steam, no heat control. No heat control, burned popcorn.A few of the kernels were perfect. They tasted great. The red color was entertaining. But, just a few.Try another brand."
3,It's OK,"This popcorn pops well, minimal old maids, we have an electric popper. However it's a little bland, had to use more butter/salt than what we use with our standard popcorn."
5,Earth real popcorn taste,"We have enjoyed this red popcorn very much. Very ""earthy"" natural taste. Works well in our popper, very few unpopped kernels"
1,Too Tough and Almost Tastless,"I didn't like the Amish Red Popcorn at all. 98% of it did not pop in a hot air popper. What little that popped was too tough and almost tasteless. I dumped it and bought Orville Redenbacher White Corn Gourmet. It was the kind of popcorn I love, and over 98% of it popped in the hot air popper. I'll stick with Orville."
2,Disappointed in my latest purchase,"I was disappointed! The kernals were half the size ~ too small. My Sister and I were so excited to have it for our hangout time together, as I recooped from my hand surgery on my only hand. Unfortunately we did not care for it. I was bummed that I bought two. If you ever find the other bran with large kernals, please inform me.Jeanine"
2,Excellent Popcorn!,"We had been looking for a ""hulless"" popcorn for a while and ran into this one when searching the web. It has wonderful flavor and the softest little hulls we have ever seen. We will be back to by more!"
1,tastless,If you like your popcorn either burned or unpopped this is the one for you. The time for the kernels to pop varies so much that the first ones are burned by the time the last ones pop.
2,Not what I was expecting,Full disclosure I am a do it yourself popcorn newb. Made this in a wok with canola oil (no fancy machine). Not what I was expecting for the fancy description and price. Kernels popped up a lot smaller than I was expecting. A bit tougher chew than I was expecting. Maybe I'm just a newb but I prefer the supermarket bought Orville to this stuff (and so does my family).
5,Best tasting Popcorn around,I've been on a binge w/popcorn & didn't feel good about eating a lot of microwave brands. This popcorn is great! It is healthy and it tastes great even w/out butter. There is no waste because everything pops. Well worth the money.
4,amish popcorn,"Really good popcorn, shipping costs as much as the popcorn. Don't know if it is worth it."
2,So-so popcorn,"With all the great reviews of this red popcorn, I wanted to love it. But frankly, I was underwhelmed. It's a hassle with an air popper, as the kernels tend to fly out before they've popped. What does pop is rather small. I would not buy this popcorn again. The purple is much better."
5,Great Fun!!! Ex-cel-lent!!!,Great Taste. UseWabash Valley Farms 25008 Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popperand gourmet oil and butter. Ex-cel-lent.
5,love it,"This is very high qulity pop corn, I recomend it. Almost all kernels pop and they are a crisp white when they pop. Very healthy and yummy!"
2,"""How to"" falls short","I found this book to be so basic and limited in its approach that it provided little or no helpful information. As an example, on ""school"" it gives advice such as ""Don't tell your child he is wasting time in school and might as well get a job"". I found the examples given for coversations were unrealistic. The one topic I most wanted to review - homework - wasn't even covered."
2,"Review of the Book, "":The Soul's Remembrance""","I was not at all impressed with this book and how it was written. Very basic information, boring, and didn't give me any insight that I didn't already have. I've read so many books about the afterlife and near death experience etc. and I pray to God it isn't like he describes, because I can't imagine a more boring place to be in the universe. A 5th grader could have written this.The person I purchased this from got it into the mail right away. I don't recall where it was being mailed from, but it took a little longer than I expected to arrive. The seller is reliable."
1,do not purchase,"This book does not prepare you for SAT II Physics, instead it just wastes your money and time. This book does not include any hard questions at all. This book may be helpful for those who want to score 700, but for those who want to score 800 in test, this book is not useful. According to my experience so far, I would say that it is better to pay more attention in class room and you can still score 700."
5,It does work.,"My lower level is finished, so I had to cut out some pieces of sheetorck from the lower level ceiling to install these, in order to end the squeaks on the upper level floor. So far they did work. At the spots these were installed, 95% of the noise disappeared. I think it will depend on the nature of your squeaks though. If the cause is the separation between the floor joist and the plywood supporting the finished floor, then this would work. In order to find out the cause, I guess you will just have to try.Caution: for larger area of squeaking, one kit may not be enough. I used 2 for the first spot. Fortunately, the price is reasonable.I will order more of these."
3,Hardwood floor's squeaking,I think the squeaking is from my 3/4 inch hardware flooring that is on top of my subflooring. Therefore this unit did not help much.
4,Squeak Ender,This product works as claimed however it is not constructed of the highest quality materials hence the 4 out of 5. Really easy install.
5,Price saved the best for last.,"I recently had the pleasure of reading Charles F. Price's book Cock's Spur. This is the 3rd in a series of books dealing with the author's family history during the Civil war. Although Mr.Price makes it clear that this is historical fiction based on some genuine characters it is hard not to think of all of these well developed characters as being factual.His first two books in this series start the story of a Southern family torn by their loyalties and the desire to do the right thing in a difficult time. And, there were very bad times for this family as only the Civil war could provide. However, there are some truly beautiful moments too that help to balance the story.Although I highly recommend the first two books you could read the last, Cock's Spur, on it own without loosing the thread of the previous story. I can't say enough good things about this book and hope you have the opportunity to read it."
5,Earthy and engrossing,Mr. Price makes this history flow with fleshed out characters and inviting narritive. A thoughtful and well written book that you won't put down till it's finished.
2,It's made of painted compressed paper,"The quality of this product is something many individuals are excepting as ok,It is not in my opinion. Furniture made from compress paper will not stand up with time."
3,Genealogy Research Tool,"As the title says, this volume contains the Land Records of Sussex County Delaware between 1681 and 1725. In general, land records are less helpful to genealogical researchers than wills and proceedings of probate courts (which are more likely to contain names of relatives). However this volume is helpful for those looking for additional confirmation of residence. An index is included."
3,Creed + volume + angst,"What the heck happened to Canada?Why is it that our neighbor to the north keeps giving us music that is so incredibly blah?On one side, you have Avril Lavigne, a teen pop star who pretends she isn't one, and on the other side, you have Nickelback.This album really isn't that bad, but the problem is that it's not that good either. Nickelback is definately hard rock; any harder and people would start calling them metal. Unfortunately, with the exception of one or two songs like ""How You Remind Me,"" the album sounds like one big, loud angstfest.What happened to the days when Canada gave us artists like Rush?"
5,Silver Side Up,"1 Never Again: A This song is great. It has some cussing in it.2.How You Remind Me: A++ This song is one of the best on the CD.3.Woke Up This Morning: B+ It's Cool.4.Too Bad: A++ This & How You Remind Me is the best song on the CD.5.Just For: B- This is a cool song.6.Holywood: B+ Good song.7.Money bought: A Wow this song is great.8.Where Do I Hide: A+ This song is very, very cool.9.Hangnail: C This song is good but not good enough.10.Good Times Gone: A+ This song has a nice beat to it.Even though it has only 10 Songs, this album is great. I givethis album an A+++. I recommened this album to anyone who loves music."
1,I think this band and album sucks.,How would you all like it if I wrote the same review over and over and over and over again. Thats what this album is all about. The songs are very poorly written the same lyrics are used over and over on all the songs. How you remind me that song is a joke I know it gets alot of air play and thats because it easy to memorize the word and sing along to but if you really listen to it its a horrible song and it the same way with To bad. I cant wait for the Nickleback era to be over. This isnt rock&roll buy any strecth of the imagination. This is called stealing your money. Any time you see an album with 39 minutes of track time you have to question it. If you like lstening to garbage than this album is for you.
2,"It's Not Like ""How You Remind Me""","I liked the song/video for How You Remind Me, and Nickelback hails from my hometown, so I decided to buy the CD. I'm really disappointed.All of the intuitive lyrics and emotion of How You Remind Me were pretty much dumped for the rest of the CD. It's too abusive and hard. It's just all the same notes, heavily distorted, and a lot of yelling.Also, even though it's not labeled, this CD is full with Explicit Lyrics, making it sound worse to me."
3,OK,"well, the CD is OK i guess, but I sometimes wonder if the whole CD is the same song...i was listening to it just this morning and i was like ""has the song changed?"" and it was on song number7....so its basicly all the same thing...but its OK i guess...i like How you remind me....thats why i bought the CD in the first place, ""how u remind me"" is the best song on here. this isnt very helpful is it?"
2,Well....,"Original? No, not hardly. Yes, it has been done before, and better. But catchy? Yes. The ""hit"" everyone apparently knows thanks to overkill play, ""How You Remind Me,"" is indeed very catchy. Admittedly it's a decent song, but yes it does become tiresome, especially when you turn to the rest of the CD looking for variety and instead find 9 songs that all sound the same. Some of the songs are done fairly well, but it really is quite repetative, not to mention wholly unoriginal to begin with. One song I do kind of like, if for no other reason than for it almost sounds different from the others, is the hint-of-country-music-influence trend-following ""Good Times Gone."" Even that, though, teeters on the fine line between fun and stupid. All in all, not worth buying in my opinion. Of course, I didn't care much for ""The State"" either, so if you liked their debut cd, you'll probably like this one too."
1,Do NOT buy this CD,"Nickleback proves once again how bad rock music can get. Now, I love rock, it's about the only thing I listen to, but rock and roll has really gone down the drain, and these Canadians only make it worse. Every song sounds the same, and that's not good if they sound like crap. Musical? I think not. It's loud and annoying, doing nothing that hasn't been down before. There's just no originality here. I mean none. A cover band has more originality than these guys. Meaningless hrad rock chords mixed with Chad Kroeger's annoying yelling voice and stupid lyrics about how life sucks (like that hasn't been done before) make this one of the owrst CD's of the year. I'd buy Brittney Spears before I buy Silver Side Up."
3,"Well, it is my favorite band. And there's some good songs. But there are also glitches.","This is not the worst CD I ever listened to. However, it is not the best either. See, the songs on it are very different from those on The Long Road. Some are worth hearing such as ""How U Remind me"" and ""Just For."" Unfortunately, there are also some very crummy ones, such as ""Too Bad."" The good thing is, this CD at least has some good in it and is not the album that ended the career of Nickelback, my favorite band, as said above. Even so, there are just a bit too many flaws for it to be in my top CDs. Then again, it still has enough good to be worth keeping. In short, this CD is alright, and if you must choose between a sucky CD and this one, you should get this one."
3,mmmmm,"like the first half of the cd, that's it... i bought it for the first song, which i kept playing over and over, i think people should listen to the lyrics, not just to the beatd... i'm not sure i'm gonna buy another of their cd's though"
1,not their best,"Nickelback is one of my favorite bands, but this album is their worst, I have no idea how it became platinum! The only good songs are too bad and how you remind me. Definetely not their best effort."
5,Nickelback killed it,"This Cd is crazyI don't some rock artists, but Nickelback are one of my favouritesMy favourite songs are too bad, never again, and good times"
3,O Canada,"This CD isn't bad, but it's not great. Nickelback did a pretty good job on this album. My problem with it is that I only like about half of the songs on it. The songs ""Never Again"", ""Too Bad"", ""Good Times Gone"", and ""How You Remind Me"", in my opinion are the best songs on it. Other than that, the rest of the songs are decent, but they lack something. I'm not sure what it is, but they are missing something. I think that ""Hero"" is the best song that Chad Kroeger has done. Overall, this is a pretty good CD."
4,An excellent album...,"Silver Side Up is Nickelback's third album and, in my opinion, is a four-star CD. It isn't quite as good as their debut, Curb, but some great music and angry lyrics set it apart from many of the rest. The songs show a lot of diversity between tracks, with angry and high tempo songs (""Never Again"", ""Woke Up This Morning""), Creed-like songs (""Too Bad"", ""Hangnail"") and, to be honest, a couple of below-par efforts (""Hollywood"", ""Just For"") which all add up to a must-have CD for fans of this genre. Put it this way: if you like Creed, Nickelback are a must."
3,It's ok,"This is a pretty generic hard rock album. There's no exceptional guitar riffs, catchy double bass drumming, or Geddy Lee like bass lines. However, the songs have that stick-in-your-head quality. You'll want to play this album over and over, though you'll quickly get sick of it. I'd recommend this album, though if you don't have it, you're not missing much."
5,Stunning!,"At last - a proper rock CD with intellegent lyrics that really rocks! I bought SILVER SIDE UP after hearing HOW YOU REMING ME played constantly on local radio - a thing that startled me at first as their playlist is usually made up of boy bands, dodgy ballads and dance music. Often the album does not live up to the single, but that's not the case with this one. After years of despairing that I'd ever find any new, decent rock music, SILVER SIDE UP is a truly great CD. The people of Dover don't know what's hit them as I never stop playing it!"
4,Good Solid Rock N' Roll,"Being in my mid 30's, I can barely stomach listening to a lot of the newer popular rock/alt. rock bands of the last 4 yrs or so.How does Nickelback remind me? They(and another great band:Oleander) remind me of how things were done in the early and mid-nineties, when alternative rock Rocked.Got their 1st U.S. CD ""The State"" after hearing ""Breathe"" on the radio,and breathe I did, because it was a breath of fresh air in rock.""Silver Side Up"" is a fine follow up.""How You Remind Me"" has been totally overplayed, but always sounds good on the radio.""Too Bad is a great rock song, the lead singer really wails in ""Never Again"",""Money Bought"" & ""Good Times Gone"" are really good too.Over all this CD flows together well and has some nice touches like slide guitar and neat drum grooves.Sometimes the subject matter of this CD is a little too much on the down side, but never come across as depressing as Staind or Fuel(good sounding bands though)."
5,I dont know what yall talkin about,"... Remind me is a good song, but as all do, it got old... but with songs like too bad and never again, this cd makes me coming back for more.. its emotional and nice music... its on my top 5 list for cd's. so if your looking for something that can listen to and get in touch with things, buy this cd!!!"
1,Don't waste your money on this garbage.,All of their stuff has the same structure. They're just a big money making joke. Seriously. Don't buy this crap.
1,hit the bench nickelback,I was stupid to buy this cd if you have trouble sleeping at night buy this cd silver side up isn't worth a scab if you like nickelback and you won't this cd go to the junk yard you can get one for free no offence to nickelback I'm just tryin to warn you
5,Great Music,"Nickelback...WoW, I first hear them with there song ""Leader of Men"" from their first album ""The State"". But this was the first one I had purchased and they rock!Almost every song is catchy and has great music and lyrics.Some songs talk about the lead singers haunting childhood and about all sorts of other topics worth listening too.Nickelback knows what they're doing just listen."
1,A Big Disappointment,"This CD has been collecting dust since I bought it! It was a complete waste of money because all the songs sound the same and the lead singer screams most of the time. I love bands like Linkin Park and Staind, but Nickleback seems to just be an echo of groups like Nirvana. I don't think they will last unless they find their own style of music."
2,get your own sound!!,"i give this album two stars for ""Never Again"" and ""Too Bad."" But when I heard song number five, i froze in shock. Was it me, or was i hearing Nirvana's brilliant ""Smells like teen spirit?""They need their own sound. The problem is, many ""bands"" and ""artists"" today seem to think that if they just copy someone else that made it big, it's close enough and they'll be well on their way to stardom.If you want to listen to a band that sounds sort of like them, but with their own sound, i recommend Pearl Jam...they're awesome!(After the first four tracks every single song sounds the same...it's like a twenty minute song being played over and over again! But you have to give them credit for ""Never again"" and ""too bad""...)"
3,just ok,"Nickelback is a decent band. They can play their instruments and write their own music. I am not crazy about all the songs,and afer hearing the cd several times, none of the songs except for a few stand out at all. How you remind me and too bad are the two singles and are clkearly distinguishable from the others. How u remind me is a decent song to listen to while you are trying to sleep. Too Bad is dull but has a great chorus, and never again is a good song with a great bass line, its the best one on the cd."
4,"A great, no-nonsense rock album","It's not very often that a group of guys from a small town in Alberta, Canada become so big in the American music scene, but Nickelback has done just that. Their second major-label offering, ""Silver Side Up"", is unquestionably a 'rock' album. No turntables, no synthesizers, no 72-track instrumentals featuring the London Philharmonic Orchestra and the scared bongo players of South America, no gutteral vocal yells or high pitched screams, just 4 guys w/ their guitars and drums. There is some weight to the argument that the songs on the album sound similar, but with awesome tunes like ""Never Again"", ""How You Remind Me"", ""Woke Up This Morning"", ""Too Bad"", ""Just For"", and ""Where Do I Hide"" that just make you want to crank up your stereo, who really cares? Nothing here that's breaking any new ground or straying far from the mainstream, but it's a great album overall. And it's even better to see a talented Canadian band getting some exposure south of our border."
5,Nickelback rocks it.,"As an old or new Nickelback fan, you should love this album. This is the album that first put Nickelback on the charts with ""How You Remind Me"", ""Never Again"" and ""Too Bad"". This is one of their better efforts and it is one of the few cd's where I listen to every single song, rather than skipping around to my favorites.There is literally not a bad song on this one. The song and sound quality is very good on this album, and all of the songs are just straight up rock and roll. Excellent listening."
4,It's rock music,keep rock alive! its not the best cd but its still alot better than some of the cr@-p out there. i dont think it should be played as mush as it is. however people are just over thinking it. its music. it's really easy stuff to play. but its no different than playing slayer power cords over and over and its no more repetitive sounding than a slayer album.
1,I'll take my nickel back.,"Not really though, because I would never buy this band's garbage (music). They're super bad and super generic. But I bet Roadrunner is happy that they finally have another big hit after Slipknot's 'Wait and Bleed' Remix. Woohoo for them. But unfortunately for people with functioning eardrums, it's another story. And the other story is sad. Nickelback is just another slue of bands jumping on the alternative train. Other such examples are as followed: Puddle of Mudd, Default, and Staind. Like the aforementioned bands, Nickelback is very bad. Once again we have a band playing the same guitar riffs with virtually the same beats as all those other alternative bands. Accompanied by bland and uninspired lyrics. This type of stuff is pretty sickening if you ask me. And what's even more sickening is that people buy into this horrible ""music"". I want it all to go away, so take your nickel back. No one with any musical integrity should want it."
2,Stale Crap Rock,Nickelback does write about things that I can relate to like family problems and abuse but....this music sounds like crap.Its the type of rock thats so unoriginal and makes you cringe.Its like biting into a stale chip.
2,Overrated - Inconsistent and formulaic! 2.5 stars.,"I remember when I bought this album when I was 21. I was so excited to get this at the time. I liked most of the songs and some were so so or sucked. I used to listen to this album pretty often, but I realized that these guys are really not that good. They lack a front man with any range, Chad writes elementary insipid lyrics, and they stick to the same formula. Silver Side Up is not a bad album by any means, but is it not all that great either. If you are going to buy a Nickelback album, get The State and maybe Curb. Avoid Silver Side Up and the rest that come after unless you are a die hard fan. If you are still a fan of Nickelback, it is time to see the light and do away with the mediocre formulaic outfits of the current era."
1,Just pierce my eardrums right now...,"Chad Kroger sucks my more than any other 'successful' artist in the history of the music industry. He has no talent and needs to learn what real music is and stop feeding such horrible atrosities to our youth to drone over and accept just because some dumbass DJ plays it on a rock station. Just because its on the radion doesn't mean it doesn't suck my ass completely. Please never compliment this no talent hack, because he doesn't know sharps and flats from the smell of is own ass. Anybody giving him more than one star should be shunned forever from making any commentary on music ever again. Thank you for your time and i hope I have enlightened you to how much Nickelback sucks."
2,Whoa............. OK eh heh!!!!!!!!!!!,Yeah i used to like this band but...... now i dont its a little strange i guess but their posers trying to be like other bands by sayin F*** in one of their songs. AND WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY DOING ON THE BEST RECORD COMPANY IN THE WORLD ROADRUNNER RECORDS HUH!!!! It makes me wonder..........
5,Really rocks!!!,"Most of you maybe you are saying that this is overrated but that means it's a hit, something to be a hit needs to have some airplay, I think a song like ""How You Remind Me"" or any other huge hit must be always on radio stations, then why older songs of 70's and 80's they are on radio everyday?By the way, ""How You Remind Me"" was one of the biggest hits ever and ""Silver Side Up"" was the beginning of a successful future for Nickelback. I'm really get bored with all the guys that bury this band. All the bands have to start from somewhere."
4,"First for me, but definitely not the last","I am a new Nickelback listener so I cannot tell you about their development as a band up to this point, but I can tell you that this CD is a terrific CD and has really led them to be listened to by a larger audience. I am sure that most people who listen to contemporary music and even those who don't have heard their sond How You Remind Me and Too Bad. These are two great songs, definitely enough reason to buy this CD. But there are many other good songs on it also such as harder ones like When I Woke Up This Morning and Nevermind. Admittedly they're are a seemingly extraneous songs, but overall the CD is a teriffic CD."
5,why should I write a title,"I love this CD, so I don't know why any of you are complaining, except for maybe ""Hollywood"", that's the onbly track I don't like. Yeah, its a little short, but I think the quality is really good. ""How You Remind Me"" is maybe my 3rd or 2nd favorite, ""TooBad"" And ""Never Again"" tying for first, ""Woke up this morning"" and ""Just For"" tying for 2nd/3rd. Never Again i feel deserves special recognition cause nobody else writes about abuse, its impersonal enough to I believe not step on anyone's toes, but yet shows ppl who may be abused that some ppl actually notice it. The rest are more universal, but still really, cool, especially if your parents love reggae, you can blast your music over theirs. I really think any Nickelback fan should have this Cd, it basically represents all that Nickelback is."
2,only silver plated..,"As everyone else has already stated the CD starts off good with ""Never Again"" and ""How You Remind Me,"" not suprisingly the two hit singles, but after that there isn't anything else that really stands out. Plus, with the radio stations playing the only two good songs constantly they get old really quick. I was really dissapointed in this CD.. and the fact that there are now dozens of bands that sound just like this one. Theres no originality anymore."
2,God i hate song by song reviews,"There really is no point giving a song by song review of Silver Side Up because there are such minor differences between each song. Nickelback make generic made-for-radio angst rock. When it comes down to it, they're really just a heavier Matchbox 20, or is that 3 doors down? Anyway, if you swapped the members of Nickelback with the members of 3 Doors Down, the average listener wouldn't be able to tell the difference. It's all the same commercial radio fodder. There are better more creative rock albums out there!!, i swear it!!, please beleive me!!"
2,"Oh, no, another one of those bands!!!","My God, another one of those bands! The vocals are all the same!! The CD starts pretty well, then after two or three songs things fall in the same category: noise, identical vocals, a mess of tracks badly mixed to cover the band's debilities!! IT's a mixture of grunge and nu-metal... well, whatever, this CD is junk."
5,One of the best CDs availible,"When I first heard Nickelback last year I knew they were good, but when I heard How You Remind Me off of their lastet I knew they were AWESOME. It includes songs about different feelings about life like How You Remind me. It also has songs about the bad things in life that happen to people like how Never Again is about domestic violence and Too Bad is about messing up. If you are just want to get this CD for How You Remind Me you ar ein for a huge surprise.Overall this CD is a great deal and very fun to listen to. If you are a rock fan this is a must-have CD. All the songs are great, but a few really stand out. The best songs are:#1 Never Again#2 How You Remind Me#3 Woke Up THis Morning#4 Too Bad#9 Hangnail"
3,canada's version of staind,"yup, heard this before. its an okay cd. but nothing here to get all excited about. if you like creed, staind, fuel, or anything along those lines, you will like the cd. if you like how you remind me, buy it. otherwise, spend your money on alien ant farm, incubus, or lifehouse."
3,Many who have written reviews are right...,"This CD is good, and there are 2 or 3 possible hit-singles (I suspect 'Never Again' will be their next single), but as many reviewers have correctly pointed out, it does seem the same style is repeated over and over again. In fact, you often find yourself listening to the same repeated-lyric several times in each song...simply because they could not put in any other lyrics. Seems they are fond of repetition.But, if you can get beyond that, this CD is pretty good, but I was a little disappointed that the band would do such with their music.If you like Staind, and Creed, you'll probably also like this CD. I would say your chances of liking this band above Staind or Creed are slim-to-none, but that does not mean you won't take a few songs off this CD when you burn your own ""My Favorite Songs"" CD."
4,This R-O-C-K-S!,"My friend was talking to me in science and said his favorite band was Nicklback. I was ranting on about Duncan Sheik. I said""Who is Nickleback?"" One day,I was surfin the net for lyrics and I found ""How you Remind Me"". Thinking it was a misnamed Usher song, I clicked. I found one of the best rock songs ever. I'm a die-hard N'Sync fan, but this is such an appealing album that couldn't be passed it up. Thank you Wes(friend) and Nickleback! Buy this CD! Even if you hate rock, this album will open your eyes to the wonderful world that is Nickleback!"
2,Two stars for the two songs I like!!,"I heard from some acquaintances of mine how good this album is. I decided it was time to hear it for myself and downloaded it. Hoestly people, this album is really nothing special. The only two songs worth replaying are ""Never Again"" and ""Too Bad"". I used to like ""How You Remind Me"" before radio stations everywhere overplayed it to death! The rest of the songs are just mediocre, repetitive rock songs with nothing special about them. Maybe I would like some of these new alternative rock bands if they actually had some substance!!"
1,Further Decline of good music,"First off I'd like to ask a question. What in the blue hell is a band like this doing on Roadrunner Records? Roadrunner is home to such bands as Misfits, Slipknot, Obituary, Soulfly...does this sound like a label that should carry a horrible Creed/Live want-to-be band?"
2,Generic Hard Rock,"Nickelback's second album is a collection of generic hard rock songs. The Canadian quartet is the 21st century version of such 70's acts like Kansas or Molly Hatchet, faceless bands who play faceless music. The band's number one hit ""How You Remind Me"" is actually a good, catchy song with some stinging lyrics about a broken relationship. Unfortunately, the rest of the album is one derivation after another of that theme that aren't quite as catchy as ""How You Remind Me"". Silver Side Up doesn't offer anything groundbreaking or original, but if you like hard rock music, then this album may be for you."
4,Pretty good but there are better bands.,"Silver Side Up is one of Nickelback's finest albums. However, I do agree with others that say a lot of their songs are repetitive and sound alike. If you want to hear some truly astounding music, just pick up Master of Puppets by Metallica."
3,decent,"a decent cd, talented artists, good music, it just all sounds the same, no big high points or low points, it sounds like one big long song"
5,AWESOME!!!,"If you like Creed, you'll LOVE Nickelback. Same song/music/lyric/message format as Creed. I HIGHLY recommend this CD! You won't be disappointed! I have recommended it to several of my friends, now I am recommending it to all of you!"
4,I prefer this one - against all others!,"This CD makes NICKELBACK famous - worldwide. And i can only agree with other customers. It's still the best! The Real Thing - because of tracks like ""HOW YOU REMIND ME"" and my all-time favourite ""TOO BAD"". It hits you like a hammer! That are burners! Because of that 4* - The rest is trash!All other albums haven't got a soul - every single repeats itself. In a very few moments Chad can get a hit (for example only in corporation WITH SANTANA ""INTO THE NIGHT"" 2007). But that's it! I LIKE NICKELBACK VERY MUCH, but every artist had TOP CLASS times - now (in 2008) it's going down... Mainstream - making money as much as you can...WHEN YOU LIKE NICKELBACK AT IT'S BEST - TAKE THIS ONE... (from 2001). This album contains the hot stuff.PS: Nickelback is a very good live-band too! I can only say watch on YouTube NICKELBACK ""TOO BAD"" or ""HOW YOU REMIND ME"" LIVE AT >>ROCK AM RING<< 2004 - Eifel, Nuerburgring - (FESTIVAL IN GERMANY) and you know what i mean..."
5,silver side up: the third album from my third favorite group,"...they start with never again, the maddest song i've ever head from these boys. then they hit the semi-soft how you remind me, and that kinda slows you down. here's my review for all the songs on this great piece of artwork.never again - it's very hard. it's very mean. i like the guitar, but i wouldn't appriciate the lyrics if my life depended on it.how you remind me - it's a softie at the beginning, but you're in for a surprise after the chorus. ...those are the only songs i listen to, and those are the only ones i have time to get to. ...this is a pretty good album after all, it's got meaningful lyrics, the don't really say anything bad if you avoid never again..."
1,Not worth it,"This CD is, by no means, worth your money. The only songs I'm particularly fond of are ""Never Again"" and ""Too Bad."" Even ""How You Remind Me"" has gotten old and dull. The music itself is too simple and predictable. For example, ""How You Remind Me"" has the same repetitive bass line throughout. The drum parts aren't riveting enough to make the songs very good. Instead, use your money to buy Creed or Staind, 2 similar (post-grunge) artists who are far superior to Chad Kroeger and Nickelback."
1,Makes me wish I didn't have ears.,"Whenever I hear these singles on the radio, I want to gouge my ears with an ice pick just so I never have to hear another Nickelback song. I flip through 4 stations and sometimes all 4 are playing Nickelback(or someone trying to sound like them). If this is the sound of this generation, then music is dead."
4,the best hard rock I ever heard!,"When I saw Nickelback's add for this on TV, I thought they were one of those soft bands, judging by their choice of album art. I judged the book by its cover, or in this case, the CD cover. Boy, was I wrong! This is great stuff man! I sang how you remind me at school and everyone just loved it. It is such a great song. It is my favourite song on the album. The reason why I'm only giving it four stars is because they aren't as good as Green Day and I gave Green Day five stars. No band or single artist is as good as Green Day.So you should check this out. They write great songs, and I haven't heard a single song by them I don't like so far.And as for mullet ""guess im wasting my time writing a review :)"", what are you on about? If you do not think fans of this band have been exposed to very much music, then you're wrong. I watch a musical every week, and I listen to loads of music. I take the subject at school. So maybe you wanna think about that statement again."
3,An perfectly average cd!,"Silver-Side Up is a cool cd if you are into bands like 3 door's down and you might find this interesting. It is probably Nickleback's best yet but, I know they can do better. Don't get me wrong I like the band but,there is other cd's out there that I would rather buy. The cd is an overall strong album with a few good songs and a few bad songs. Nickleback is one of those band tha look like they will have a strong future. It is up to you if you want to check it out it is totally up to you I'm just saying that is an average cd but, the band has potential!!!"
4,Good rock cd.,"Great cd. I think it is very similar to their cd ""the state"". If you like it you should like this. ""how you remind me"" is probably the best song on the cd. ""Never Again"" is an emotional song about domestic violence. Overall i'd have to say i'm disappointed that it only had 10 tracks on it but at least most of them are good."
2,Never buy an album unless you hear it first.,"I loved The State, so I bought Silver Side Up with only hearing How You Remind Me. Bad move. While the album appears to be more personal with songs that seem to be about an abusive father-figure and similar - it just sounds too much like cheesy 80's rock. While I like How You Remind Me, the ""yeah yeah, no no"" repeated over and over again is tiring, and a lot of the album is like that. Its like they were grasping for rhymes and so on. I'm going to listen to it a few more times, but it doesnt compare to The State."
4,alternative rock at its best,my bro got this cd for his bday he wouldnt let me listen to it so i took it and was able to hear the cd and from 1st sight i lovde it from the great lyrics to the cool guitar riffs this is alternative rock aqt its best
5,My favorite CD of 2001,"What can I say....This CD rocks! Great CD to wake up with on the commute to work. A large coffee and ""Silver Side Up"" and I'm ready to go!! From beginning to end this CD seems to flow so well and not all the songs sound the same as some albums in this genre do. Nickelback's songs are well written--no cliche' wimpy ballads with some cheesy chorus on this one. Virtually every song has a great guitar hook that grows on you after several plays. You just have to crank up the volume for tracks like ""Hollywood"", ""Where Do I Hide"" and ""Too Bad"". It goes way beyond the 1st two releases--This is NOT one of those albums where you find yourself only enjoying the song you heard on the radio which lured you into buying it in the first place. I only wish it were a bit longer--but hey, I'll take quality over quantity any day. Congratulations Vancouver on having these guys home to party with on New Years Eve!"
2,A Definite Step Down,"Nickelback's sophomore effort is disappointing, to say the least. Their first, ""The State,"" was one of the best albums of 2000. The industrial/grunge combination blew Nickelback's competitors out of the water. And then came ""Silver."" Nickelback decided to dump its industrial influences and go with metal/grunge, probably in an attempt to cash in on Staind's success, while at the same time essentially losing all its originality. After hearing ""How You Remind Me,"" the only great song on the album, I rushed out and bought ""SSU"" the day it was released on a whim. Never have I been more disappointed. These songs lack the power of ""Breathe,"" ""Old Enough,"" and ""Worthy to Say,"" songs from their debut album. Not to mention the riffs are drudgy and unoriginal. Stay away."
1,What you can't give no stars?,"...Alternative music is starting to sound like one band is making all the music and changing their name. If you like wannabe hardcore with fake riffs right after the corus go out and buy the album. if you want cliched life's so bad lyrics buy the album. if you want good, pure, non-comercial music, don't."
2,Same silver over and over again...,"When I heard This Is How You Remind Me on the radio knew that I wanted to get the CD. I was hoping that it would have some great variety as the song itself had but I was wrong. The CD just sounds like it's the same song played over and over again. I bought it for the one song, so that was my fault but I guess higher expectations just hurt my rating of the cd in general.... sorry if I have offended anyone. I just feel that their last CD was better in my opinion."
1,NOT GRUNGE!!!,"This cd is a waste of your time, and money. Nearly every song sounds similar to the other & they quickly become repetetive. forget these guys, along with those other bands (Default) & (Puddle of Mudd). No matter what the magazines & tv are saying, believe me, THEY ARE NOT GRUNGE!bands like Mudhoney & Soundgarden(real grunge bands) have so much more of an edge that these guys really lack, plus they're not so ""wha-wha"" (feel sorry for me) sounding like nickelback sounds.Save your cash & buy ""bad motor finger"" by soundgarden instead, it's a classic."
1,Kerrang review,"Kerrang reviewed this band and gave them nothing. Any singer who throws a strop at a gig because a guy in the front row is giving him the birdie does not not deserve a f^ckin thing. worse still the band stopped playing until the offending member of the public was thrown out. As kerrang quite eloquently put it..""Nickelback are sh!t"". Buy Zakk Wylde's new cd Eternal if you want real metal. FOAD"
3,Silver Side Down,"Nickelback's third major album - following Curb, and then The State, had two great hits which became well known to people everywhere - first off ""How You Remind Me"", and then later on ""Too Bad"".However, having listened through this album many times, I can't help but feel that 75% of the songs have a sort of beat, or tune, that those others do too. Sure, it's different, albeit not by much.The CD is worth a listen, but expect it to get a little repetative after a month or three."
4,Nickelback Rocks,"The other person who wrote, ""Can I take it back?"" seems to really hate Nickelback. I on the other hand love this cd. Every one hates to buy a cd and find out they only like one or two songs. I think that true Nickelback fans will agree this cd is good. After hearing a bunch of their songs on the radio I went to check their new cd out. I was really surprised to find all the songs I love from the radio on one cd. Test out the song samples above and see what you think. As far as complaining and whining goes that is what most rock/metal is, complaining, yelling and good old angry music. That's the point. If I want to hear happy music I will listen to my kids Pokemon cd."
4,just a good album,"i bought this record and the new album of alanis morrisettebut this record is better.i don't know why somebody wrote that this groupsounds like pearljam.it doesn't (i don't like pearljam at all)and it is not grunge, and not just a emo bandit is just a good rock album"
2,Not good in the long run,"I've owned this cd for a while now, and I haven't listened to it in at least a year. I liked it the first few months I owned it, but I look back and I realized that the whole second half of the album is at best average and forgettable. I still like the first 4 tracks, 3 of which were turned into radio singles. I like the Long Road a lot more right now...I recommend it over this cd if you want more variety. But to each his own."
1,You just have ta love this country,This is the best country I've heard in my life! I was amazed how great Chad voice for country. All those catchy high-note guitar solos. This is what we call rockin'-----country style. ...
1,I WANT MY NICKEL(S) BACK,"Love the song How You Remind Me. At least it has some melodic content with good drive. Chad Kroeger's vocal talents shine on this song. The rest of the CD was a incredible example of ""What is this mess"" A depressing succession of Wannabe Creed but have no REAL music/lyric writing talent. My prediction, one hit wonder with a small following. Buy the single."
1,Silver Side,"A guy I trust at the record store recommended this album to me. I have to admit, there are a couple good guitar riffs on the album, but the melodramatic Bon Jovi style lyrics is enough to make anyone with at least a little testosterone want to puke. If you have any of Julia Roberts' movies on DVD, this album is for you."
4,the best cd of the year.,Nickelbacks new cd Silver side up is full of non stop hitslike How you remind me Never again and TOO BAD.I think that this is a major improvement from there last cd The State.This cd is a great gift for anybody so i'm giving it 4 stars.
2,Monotonous,As in mono-tonous. Every songs sounds the same....Even my kids quickly tired of this one.
3,"Two Good Songs, as Expected","I bought this CD knowing that there are only 2 good songs, the ones you have heard on the radio. I accept this truth...you should, too. The rest of the CD is just noise and there are unfortunately no good surprises."
2,Nickleflop,"In 1970, 2 British groups, Led Zeppelin (in ""LZ 2"") and Deep Purple (in ""In Rock"") established the formula of hard rock. Since then hundrets of hard rock groups repeated the formula time and again, made it poor, primitive, moronic, limited, and boring. From time to time we had the chance to listen to something else (like Nirvana and few more from Seatle), but it was an ekseption. ""How you remind me"" had that fresh-promising sound which made me buy the CD. Bad mistake. 3 good starters and then - total boredom. You'd be amazed to know how easy it was to fall asleep after listening to that noisy boring hard rock group. Sleeping pill couldn't do better."
4,Good CD,"This CD is a great example of modern rock, and it is a very solid CD, you can play it on repeat several time before it gets old. Conclusion, worth buying"
1,BORING,"The only reason this song got so popular was because they wronte the most ""radio-friendly"" song in existance. They are completely unoriginal, and so boring I cant even stand to listen to a few songs off the album. I never bought it by the way, just heard it."
1,Dull music for a dull industry,"Wow, what a pile. This is how this band reminds me of all the other top 40 MTV bands that I've ever heard, all smashed together with pretty girl videos and pretty long hair and a cute guitarist.Does anyone remember how to make exciting, creative music anymore? This thing is so boring, sort of like Linkin Park, Matchbox 20, Bush, Creed, new Incubus, just dull and lifeless.I don't recommend this album. Please give me something worth listening to."
2,Boring....,"Another dissapointment in a year of many dissapointments. ""How You Remind Me"" is a good song, but every other song on the album is exactly like it...But if you like your music repetive and boring you can't go wrong here.Same old guitar chords...same old lyrics...same old everything from song to song."
2,Okay at best,"Yes, that's what I said, okay at best. That's because the best song on the album happens to be How You Remind Me, and it's just okay. There's nothing else on this record that's really worth anything, except for possibly Never Again and Good Times Gone. The tunes all seem the same after a couple tracks and the lyrics aren't particularly interesting either. Nickelback's theme seems to be of hardship and sorrow, and that's fine with me, but they could at least try to put a little more variety into their music. They have some potential, of course. Frontman Chad Kroeger has a great voice, and it is decent rock, but if you just download the three songs I mentioned then you ""miss out"" on seven other tracks that sort of blend together and have no meaning. That's a good thing."
5,Excellent CD,I've listened to this CD over and over again. Every song is excellent! It is rare to find a CD where every song is great. This CD is a rare find!
1,P.A.I.N.,"Nickelback redefines the meaning of ""pain"" upon listening to this CD. This stuff is pure drivel! What are these morons whining about and whats with the inappropriate...guitar solos?!? I know several garage bands that live in their parents' basement that are more deserving of a recording contract. There ought to be a law... You could find better entertainment by watching rotting fruit."
1,All the Songs are the same,"I couldn't believe this album. I put in the CD in the player and pushed play. Song 1...alright, not bad. Song 2...wait isnt that Song 1. Ok, Song 3...what the...same as 1 and 2. Ok...I went through every track and besides the overplayed but good song ""How you remind me"" every song is the same. I swear a couple of them use the exact same guitar riff just slightly different distortion. Anyways, I was extremely disappointed in this album because all the songs are the same with different depressing lyrics that not many can relate to. Not worth the money...just download their hit."
3,30% Per Album,"Today's formula for selling albums appears to have us at a standstill. Not so says iTunes, Napster, and now my favorite Yahoo Unlimited! There are 3 songs that are good, the rest are just formulated drivel that Chad and crew could have done much better on. A decent album that could have been great."
3,mmmhhh,"1. Never Again2. How You Remind Me3. Woke Up This Morning4. Too Bad5. Just For6. Hollywood7. Look What Your Money Bought8. Where Do I Hide9. Hangnail10. Good Times GoneI havn't listned to it in a while.I'll be honeest I got it for ""How You Remind Me"". All and all a good cd."
2,Waste of money,"I bought this cd thinking that it was going to be good. I had heard the single How You Remind me and I thought it was good. The cd is anything but. The only songs that are half decent are Never Again and Too Bad and How You remind me, but once you have heard them a few times then they have served their cause. The rest of this cd is completely [junk]. This band should go for something a little more original and less repetitive. They should try and get more lyrics in instead of repeating themselves and make the music sound different on each song. This akbum is just rushed and a waste of money."
3,An average album overall,"Many of you may find Nickelback's Silver Side Up release rather disappointing. It all depends on how well you like their radio hits. If you really like ""Never Again"" and ""How You Remind Me"" and nothing else, this album won't disappoint you. However, if your looking for other strong tracks on the album, you'll be highly disappointed. I don't think the album is horrible, nor do I think it's all that exciting. It is a solid release, but is lacking a solid set of high-quality tunes. I would suggest that you purchase ""Curb"" before purchasing this album. 3 Stars."
5,got to get!!,"I had heard ""how you you remind me"" on the radio and loved it, so I bought the album. I listined to the first track-GREATAll of them are great! But thats just me, so listen to some songs before you by the album!! Hope you enjoy it!See Yah!"
1,Waste of money,"Do you ever buy a cd and there's only one good song on the entire thing? It usually ends up being used for a coaster or a frisbee. This is one of those cd's. I almost didn't buy this cd just for the picture on the back, I should've gone with my gut. These guys are stuck in 91. It's just a bunch of repetitive (...). The songs all sound the same and there's only one that's worth listening to. Do yourself a favor and buy the single if you can't download it."
2,"A passive album with a hint of ""one hit wonder""","From an unbiased point of view and an avid hard rock fan, I gave this album a fair try, but after completing the album, I found myself wondering how this band is so popular. Most of the songs are either easily forgetable or repetitive, lacking in diversity and catchiness. It's the type of songs you can listen to for the first few times, but after a while you get sick of hearing it as it lacks any flavor.Recommend you pass on this one. Recommendations on albums to buy this year would be Incubus ""morning view"", Stone Temple Pilots ""shangri-la dee da"", Pod ""satellite"", and Linkin Park ""hybrid theory""."
1,You get what you pay for--it's only a nickel,"Once,when I was working,I had only this album&a couple of others to listen to.For some reason,I didn't go for Nickelback.It's just a lot of groaning&whining.This isn't worth anyone's time or money.I'm happy with my world music collection,and I'm glad I haven't spent a cent on Nickelback.Every song SOUNDS THE SAME!!!!!"
3,Good or Bad?,"You've gotta love how you remind me and never again. They rock. But it's songs like Just for and Too Bad that make it worse. You may have a totally different oppinion. I mean I like the cd and all, it's just a few songs that are kinda bad. They really rock it out on how you remind me and Never Again, which is my favorite. I still say you wouldn't be wasting money if you bought this cd. Oh yeah! Check out number 6 on this cd, called Hollywood. Great song. See more of my reviews on Linkin Park's Meteora and Hybrid Theory. See ya later rock fans!"
1,Never saw something like that...!!,"NICKELBACK made something very unique, seldom I've witnessed something like that in the rock genre:The CD starts pretty well with two very good tunes: Never Again and How You Remind Me.Then, suddenly, there is simply no more CD!! It's as if there was no more songs on the whole CD, so bad and unmemorable they are! Just a mess! You can not believe it's the same band that recorded the first two tracks!! What a novelty act this band is!!!"
1,Buy the single instead...,"""How You Remind Me"" is definitely one of the catchiest songs of the year and I bought this CD because of it. Unfortunately, except for ""Never Again"", the rest of the songs are boring and sound the same. The band has potential, but they only offer a glimpse of it here. Assuming you're interested because of the single, I'd suggest checking out the Transmatic album. Not as heavy, but you'll find a CD full of songs as captivating as the song that brought you here."
2,One Good Song,"The lead singer has a great voice and the song ""How You Remind Me"" is awesome; however, the other songs don't measure up to that track. The other songs seem like filler that was added to the single to make an album out of the one good song. I highly recommend listening to this at a listening station before purchasing....better yet, download the one good song!"
2,Disappointment !,"I must confess that I was disappointed with this album after listening the whole album, Their first single ""How you remind me"" is indeed a nice catchy rock piece, which is the main reason why I bought this album. However the whole album is a disappointment. I was expecting a little better besides the single. I should have waited to buy the single CD, instead of the album."
1,not worth a nickel,horrid ...Creed imitators(who imitated Pearl Jam-who imitated bad classic rock) sung by a guy who looks a little too much like my sister's poodle.
3,So-So,50% of this release is forgettable. The other 50% is wonderful if you like popular rock. Give it a spin. But find it used if you intend to buy it.
4,Silver Side Up is a true pleaser,"Nickelback has come out with another great CD. This 10-track album has many great songs on it. Starting off the CD with 'Never Again', the group addresses the atrocity of domestic violence. My favorite song, 'How You Remind Me' is the second track; This hit, very grudge-like, is an eye-opener to people caught in a bad relationship. 'Silver Side Up', while not one of Nickelback's best albums, it's still a great CD, and is buy-worthy."
4,Impressive.,"I bought this CD after hearing ""How You Remind Me"" on Q101. It was one of the best songs I had heard in a while, and is the best song on the CD. These guys earned their success by playng loud, heavy rock and playing that formula though all the songs.The tracks did all soung familiar, though, so that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. When completely summed up, it is loud stuff that metal and hard rock fans will really like. It is definitely not nu-metal, and it is free of raps, which is a very nice change in rock these days."
3,Short and loud. Good and bad.,"Not a bad second album but I still really prefer their first record. ""How You Remind Me"" is, of course, a high point, but I was a little turned off by the heavier use of thrashing guitar. I did appreciate the in-your-face attack on domestic violence in the first track. Well done. The album still retains a ""Nickelback sound"" but the heavier guitar brings it closer to a hundred metal groups."
1,Highly Fragranced,I bought this after a moderate case of dermatitis on my face along with the cleanser in the same line. I was very surprised when I opened the jar because it smelled like perfumed body lotion. I was actually afraid to put it on my face it was so strong. Sure enough it stung like heck. But honestly that went away shortly and my face did seem less red and my dermatitis went away in 2 days of using this product. I simply don't understand why the makers of this lotion would put so much fragrance in something so marketed for those with very sensitive skin. A week later I got a huge zit on my chin which hasn't happened in years. I wouldn't put this on my face again if I was paid to.
1,Do not buy,"I have sensitive skin, I thought this would be ok for my skin because it is suppose to be ""ultra calming"". Next morning my face was red and irritated and I looked horrible."
1,Two Good Songs,"This was the only place I could find Zap Mama's version of Iko, Iko. It was worth it for that song, but the rest of the album is pretty much trash. Kind of like the leading lady in the movie was fantastic and the rest of the movie is worthless.When I wrote the paragraph above, I had forgotten about Powderfinger's song on the album. That was a very pleasant surprise and has become one of my favorite all time songs. So, buying the album was worth it for the two good songs."
4,very nice,usually soundtracks are pretty lousy and there is only one or two good songs but this soundtrack is really good there are nice songs and good artists.
2,Only useful as an overview,"It has nice topographic shading, but tends to show just empty spaces where detail on settlements and roads should be!Nearly useless, but unfortunately no other map to these regions is easily available."
4,Perfect and worked very well,My old hose died and needed another. This item was perfect and worked quite well. It was exactly as stated and arrived on time.
5,"As with Conjure One and Taylor Dayne, Peter Lorimer wins again","The remixes on here are all great, but the 29 Palms Mix by Peter Lorimer is just AWESOME!!! He turns out an applause-worthy trance epic that will leave you either breathless from dancing or stunned from its brilliance. SHEER BRILLIANCE, I SAY!!! BHQ's comes at a close second, followed by the phunky Passengerz Mix, the rocky Thick D**k mix, and finally, the absolutely horrendous Machinehead mix. MH does a crappy job at turning the tender love song into a dance anthem, BHQ incorporates the break with the choir and guitar (a wonderful choice to put in there), Thick D. does a house/rock mix that is a mixed result, and Passengerz incorporates their unique sound into it. A great buy if u love 2 DANCE!!!"
4,Good Movie,Have seen this movie a few times over the years and always enjoy it. Recommend this movie if you enjoy drama/thrillers.
3,Hhmmmm....,"You'll love this CD if you're young. To me, I just love Raven's songs. Overall, this CD is not worth buying."
1,"This ISNT Joseph. I am his oldest daughter! Anyway, 1 star for the Naked Mole Rap . . . .","That's the only worth listening to on this crap of a Disney CD. If you want really disney, get Disney Mania 1 and 2 ( 3 sucks)."
1,Finally...More Disney Produced Crap,"Useless you are 4 to 10 years old, you will loathe this CD. It more Disney produced crap that sucks. Don't buy!"
2,"A ponderousm pedestrian tome, not worthy of Carpenter","Ken Trodd, like Potter a ""scholarship boy"" at Oxford, went on to produce Potter's finest works in a relationship bubbling with catalytic ferment and often boiling or exploding. As Trodd observes (in a probably unpublished review)he personally appears in this biography more often than DP's wife,mother,or agent, but his relevant insights, like his essential role in DPs creativity, are not apparent. Carpenter was not given to hack P.R jobs! Whyever did he agree to an ""authorized"" (i.e. supervised and censored) biography?"
5,Great Beard/Wig for Alan costume,"I used the beard/wig combo for my Alan (The Hangover) costume. After a quick scissor job the beard/wig were perfect. A few tips, comb the wig and beard out with a big comb, let the hair rest, and then trim it up. Only drawback was the mustache; it had a hard time staying close to my face at first. BUT, after some manipulation I was able to fix the problem and it did not bother me all night. Also, use the front band on the beard to hold your hair back and slide the second band to hold the beard up BEFORE you put on the wig. HAVE FUN!"
5,It did the job!,"I'm recently gettin' back into the datin' scene.My social skills are okay. I'm VERY personable.People LIKE me.However, I'm NOT the best lookin' guy on the planet.I bought THIS, and decided it would help on my BLIND DATE.I rang the door bell. The young lady answered her door,and saw me standing there with this one-piece disguiseon.After her horrified look, I immediately took it off andgave her my $10,000 smile. We get married next summer!..................I wonder HOW MANY people don't read t-h-i-s far down to notice I completely made all of the above up. But this IS great for pranks and Hallowe'en!"
3,"Good for caveman, not for Hagrid.","To be fair, I am rating the purchase based on my intended use. I wanted it for a Hagrid costume. The hair was not long enough for a Hagrid costume. Probably fine for cave man. That being said, it was also very itchy. the hair was hard to style, or even get pointed in a direction. You will have to trim up around the mouth to use it at all. Plan on drinking with a straw. I still rate it OK. It was not uncomfortable other than the itching. It did look pretty good once you got it on and got the hair in the direction you wanted. It is very brown. Not dark brown, but on the orange side. I would buy again if i was dressing as a caveman, and I did not plan to wear more than an hour or so."
4,What I expected!,We had a wig themed costume party to attend and my boyfriend chose this as his wig. It looks a little more burly on the picture but it definitely did it's job. He wore it all night and it was a hit at the party. I think it was a little difficult to drink with the mustache but he managed to do it. Great for the price!
5,Perfect Caveman Beard,"We bought this for my husbands halloween costume of a caveman. It had just the effect we were looking for and matches the picture. The moustache doesn't stay on perfectly, but a little double sided tape may fix that."
5,"Vivid, Dangerous, Fun, what more can I say?","Michelle tea has such a way of making these character that, even for a few brief moments, you actually care about. This story is more than just a study of [...] culture in San Francisco. It's more the trajic story of one person ill fated search for love and as a reader you have to respect that. Gonna pick up her next work. Hope it will be as good as valencia."
1,Sorry I bothered,"This was the first book I seriously considered not finishing; having given up any thought that the author had something to say to me.Purportedly a study of the young San Francisco dyke scene, the main characters are one dimensional caricatures. A chronicle of there rather boring lives the book celebrates their lack of work ethic and their poor taste in tattoos.This may appeal to children with a chip on their shoulder and no desire to function in society at large, but its message was lost on me."
2,ive been reading some michelle tea,"to see what all the hype is about, and i think i figured it out. when i was a teenager, everyone loved lame movies like empire records, and i never understood why. now as ive seen those fans grow up a bit, i see that they love books, movies, etc that depict the kind of people they wish they could be, dyed hair, drugs, fast life blah. basically, if you aspire to be a writer with lots of tattoos and you want alot of attention, michelle tea is for you."
3,Interesting read,"Michelle Tea's story is certainly interesting and unlike any I've ever read before. These girls say and do the things that we all sometimes think about doing if we had the guts to throw caution to the wind. I alternated between cheering the characters on, and thinking that they were stupid and shallow. The writing is fast-paced and difficult in spots with bizarre capitilization and sentence structure. This is worth reading, if you aren't picky about everything being believable."
3,Fast and fun,"This humorous and madcap story of one girl's life in San Francisco is perfect for those once into Judy Blume and now into riot grrls and Ani DiFranco. Taking place in one year, the narrator pursues her desires through a number of women in search of enduring love and great times. Tea also delivers a classic line: ""Desire... is all about stink."" It's a very visceral and madcap story that certainly is aimed at a narrow audience. I almost didn't finish it, but Tea's narrative did encourage me to follow to the end."
4,makes you want to write,"Michelle's book is indeed one that is hard to put down! I felt rebellious just taking breaks at work to try to finish it. And for a long while after, I sort-of looked at everything around me a little differently--like there was a story waiting to be told in every nook and cranny. Truly a gift."
3,I feel sick,"This book made me feel sick, literally. For that, I credit the author who is truly far gifted than the three stars I award this book. I really wouldn't recommend this book unless one wants to spend the time it takes to read the book in a crystal/speed/meth induced mania. Thumbs up for any and all LGBTQ literature, but thumbs down for the self-aware self-indulgent self-destruction. I guess I've just had enough lately."
2,Required for class ...,"This book was required for a class and while the information that is covered is very thorough, they seem to leave many other things out. There is also a lot of page jumping to follow information. Definitely would not be my first choice."
2,This product does not work,This product does not work. I bought it after reading so many positive reviews. And basically flying bugs aren't affected by it. It makes you smell like peppermint and something else but won't deter insects.
3,"Don't Forget ""Housequake""!","On side one, this had ""U Got the Look"" and then a different version of the song. On the other side, it had ""Housequake"" and a remix called ""7 Minutes of Muh Quake."" I don't recall the mixes being better than the LP cuts. However, if you love the songs generally, then it's a pleasure to hear even more of it. Even as I'm typing this, the way Sheen Easton's voice crescendos at the end of the song and the following guitar solo are stuck in my head. I don't recall the ""Sign of the Times"" concert film having ""Housequake"" on it, but that song, at least in Chicago, was one of the most memorable cuts on the double LP (right after ""Adore""). A hardcore Prince fan would not be hurt by adding this to their collection."
3,not sure,"I installed these on my 2010 dodge challenger recently (all 4 sets) along with new EBC Sport rotors. I can hear them engage pretty loudly when a moderate amount of pressure is placed on the brake along with a clicking/rattling noise that grows louder as pressure is being applied. Once a certain amount of pressure has been exerted, the noise goes away. Took it to a local mechanic who recommended I just go buy OEM pads and Midas, who inspected them and said I had installed them properly and there were no issues that they could find. The noises aren't very loud, but when I roll down my windows I want to hear my Hemi, not my brakes!"
2,Doesn't work for me,"I bought this after reading some favorable reviews and that it had optical audio output. However after playing about five discs it stopped working. It now just says no disc every time I load any type of disc. The image was nice while it worked, skipping was a problem. I no longer have the receipt, since I bought it from circuit city. However if you read the many reviews on the internet and scroll through them you will see mine is a common problem.I also own the philips 1080p up-converting DVD player and that one works flawlessly, except it has not optical audio output.Warranty may be great and all but I also want something that works with no hassle. Stay away from this one as you may get one of the lemons. Get the philips 1080p up-converting instead."
5,Best Bang 4 Ur Buck!,This unit will output DTS and Dolby Digital out of the HDMI cable. Allot of others DO NOT. This unit is so simple even a caveman can use it. Its a perfect gift for an elderly person too because its features are so basic. It only has what you really only need. Very smooth picture with true colors.
4,Samsung 1080P DVD player,"I purchased this unit because I have a Samsung 1080P hdtv that recognizes any Samsung anynet device. This unit connects with one HDMI cable and the TV takes over from there! TV remote runs the unit and the TV detects and finds the signal... Works great and is very inexpensive.. I am awating the HD - Bluray battle to mature and the Samsung dual players prices to come down so this is a nice interim solution. I would reccomend Amazon and this unit for the price. The picture quality is OK with older DVDs, likely as good as any other similar upconverting uint...."
2,Extremely frustrating auto reset features and glitches,"This dvd player was cheap and I got what I paid for, I guess. The player has several annoying issues as follows:- When watching TV shows on dvd, the aspect ratio keeps auto changing to widescreen even while watching the shows non stop. You cannot save the menu settings you are currently watching.- When you change channels and return to the dvd, aspect ratio and HDMI resolution often change automatically and you have to go to the player menu to redefine what you want. Also, it often goes to blue screen or static and you have to turn it off and back on to correct.- Often gives a No Disc error when swapping out discs, even on brand new discs. You have to turn it off and back on to correct."
4,Great DvD player for bedroom,"With all the hype about Blu-ray and 1080p. I still enjoy putting a DvD in to my Samsung DVD-1080P7. It plays great on my Samsung 40"" and looks amazing"
4,Samsung DVD 1080P7,"I have had a problem with this Samsung upconverting DVD player. In the beginning and even up to 15 minutes of play there are sometimes bright flashes of light that flash across the screen. After this finishes there is an excellent picture and we are very pleased with the unit. This does not happen with all discs, and sometimes the flashing is so slight and so short that it is not be a problem. Amazon sent me a replacement unit, and it has the same problem. In discussing this with Samsung they asked me to send it to them for repair. We feel that the problem is slight enough to not bother. This is being used with a new Samsung 4071 TV and played through a new Yamaha RX-V661 receiver. HDMI chords are used.Has anyone else had this problem?"
2,"Come on Samsung, No Dual Layer DVD-R Support",Bought this item and found that it does not support Dual Layer Discs that you burn. In this day and age to come out with a player that does not support all formats is just nuts. The player has been returned and I have ordered the Sony.
2,DVD + up conversion = NOT HD,a regular DVD is not HD so you can force it to be with some fancy hardware...I haven't seen a great deal of difference. for the amount of money you're going to spend on this I recommend getting an HD-DVD player. thats what I did and I love it
3,"This would be a great, except for the disk-freezing.","Another reviewer reported that you can cure the ""freezing"" disk problem (whereby it skips and sticks as if it were a bad disk) on this model by shifting the unit to lower resolutions when watching older-format disks (like the Simpsons). Luckily, you can toggle through the four resolutions with the remote, without having to restart the disk. But it's still a pain, and the unit should be able to detect the resolution of the DVD and adjust automatically...especially since there's no way for us to know which one is the ""right"" resolution, except by trying each setting. I had to return the first one I received (glad Amazon has such great return policies), and the replacement doesn't freeze as much as the first one did."
3,Could have been better,"I gave this player a slightly lower rating since Ive had some issues with the sound going mute suddenly during a movie. The funny thing is that if I scan backward or forward the problem resolves itself. The picture quality it outputs is great and it might be because I have a Samsung LCD TV as well. Since im using HDMI, sound is good too. Im in two minds if I want to return this or not"
2,"Great picture, when it works","This player has an excellent picture on the hdmi output and very good on the component output but it has way too many problems for me to recommend it.When playing shows on the HDMI output in 1080p, the picture often gets noisy, freezes and goes black. This happens on all DVD's, both factory produced and burned. Switching to component video resolves the problem but the output is limited to 480p. The unit also totally locks up trying to play JPEG files and many burned DVD's. The power must be unplugged to clear the lockup, a real nuisance if you have the player in a cabinet.There are far better choices."
3,Not compatible with HDMI switchers,"Bought 1080P and since I have several HDMI sources and my TV has only one DVI input, had to use a HDMI switcher and the 1080 doesn't like that when playing anything with copy-guard on it. Screen goes blank every few seconds, I think the unit thinks its hooked up to a VCR. Works fine on none copy-guarded stuff and when directly put into TV via HDMI cable. Called Samsung, said to go to Component output, but picture is not nearly as good and definitely not 1080 resolution as I was told by them. Anyone know how to get rid of copy-guard? Let me know."
1,Good til it broke!,Bought this DVD player back in October 2007 so it's about a year and a half old. It worked fine and was pleased with it until it started freezing dvds. I use it occasionally and it is kept in a cabinet so I really don't think that a dvd player that is 1.5 years old should break. My next purchase will be a panasonic or sony.
2,Spend a little more to get a LOT more.,"I just bought a brand new 52"" LCD capable of 1080P and grabbed this DVD player to go with it, man am I sorry... The picture quality on this is horrible.I've tried to tweak every possible setting on the DVD player but it is very noisy/grainy. I'm not impressed at all and plan on bringing the DVD player back to Fry's tomorrow.I read a review on bestbuy's website from someone who reviewed all 1080P DVD players and said this was the worse and Philips or Panasonic had an amazing 1080P upconverting DVD player. Don't waste your time with this one.I gave it 2 stars because it looks nice, it's easy to use and the menu options are simple to use and not confusing at all."
1,No support for +R DL (dual layer),"I back up all of my DVDs to +R dual layer disks. Amazingly, this player does not support dual-layer disks, and you can't load or play such disks. If you ever plan to play anything other than store-bought dvds, don't buy this player."
3,"Good HDMI DVD, Bad tray","I like the interface, picture quality, the remote control it's huge (wish it was like apple remote). I give 3 stars due the tray system (it doesn't close fully now, after a week of purchase I rather the slotting style as Macs do."
2,audio output choice resets,"the setting for audio out is bitstream for a home theater, but when turning player off and on the setting reverts to PCS. called samsung, got bumped 3 times, says it should work, i must have a memory problem on my brand new unit."
2,It worked out ok....up converting DVD player,"I received the player in 2 days , hooked it up and discovered the loading gate would not work , therefore I could not use it.Amazon had me return it and send me a replacement within a couple of days. The new player works exellent and does every thing it is supposed to do , I certainly appreciate Amazons fast response on this."
1,Defected Samsung 1080P7 DVD player,"After reading all the reviews about Samsung 1080P7 DVD player, I went to BB to buy such a unit with the understanding that it may have quality control issue.You know what, both its component out are defected without any signal even though it was connected to a Samsung 720P LCD HDTV. It only works with composite, S-video and HDMI. I toke it back to BB immediately, and the technican there tried to get it connected to a Samsung LCD HDTV via component out, no signal just as I experienced. He proved what I told them.Samsung really has quality control issue about this product. I immediately returned to BB and bought a Toshiba SD-5000 instead. Don't trust Samsung anymore!"
2,Reveal Your Glow...Brush Your Body Beautiful,"Body Brushing has been around for centuries. Although, there are valuable health benefits associated with body brushing this book made me feel, that the author was using it primarily as a self serving, profit seeking, marketing tool. It's simply written, compiling information from other sources, mixed with her own personalized routine. In a nutshell...It's all about circulation. Keep it simple. Buy a brush. Buy some oil."
5,Great skin care at a fraction of the cost!,"This is the first skin beauty regimen I've ever done that actually works, and I hate to think of the hundreds of dollars I've wasted in the past. My skin is baby soft and my friends are commenting. Now I'm buying copies for my friends for Christmas."
3,"Easy to read. Good information, but could have more","I wish she had more pictures, so we could get a better feel for what direction to brush. In the end she did explain and urged us not to fret about it. It's worth reading. I would check out YouTube too. Hopefully, Amazon will offer a really nice DVD version of body brushing. I also, wish she had more oil mixtures listed in the book. Would have been nice to learn how she feels about essential oils and what types to use."
2,good news bad news,Good news:adidas accelerator looks great in picture advertisements and web images.Bad news: ooh but in real life that shinny silver trim is just too much. Can hardly notice it in web images.
3,Not as described.,LOvely gift idea-except it came in a cardboard and plastic packaging. Not a metal gift box. Would've ordered the less expensive model without metal box if I knew it would not be packaged as described. Not worth returning it for price.
4,"Pretty good, not bad, can't complain.....","The fit isn't bad. Installing was easy. Good value for the cash. Is it a $800 set up? No, it is what it is. Overall it works well."
5,perfect,Well made and very easy too install just make sure you keep the tailgate closed when installing the side rails
1,not worth the $,"this is a fairly thin sheet of plastic with some very slight texturing that's supposed to go under your tent. There's not enough texture to prevent the tent floor from slipping on the plastic however and every time we took a step inside the tent, it felt like the floor was going to slide out from under us.I never had that ""slippery"" feeling when using one of those cheap fiber-reinforced tarps.Additionally, the plastic is so thin that when we took it up after it being under the tent for 6 nights, you could see the newly made permanent impression from every single little fern and clump of sand. I can't imagine it lasting very long if we decided to use it again .... which we won't because I'm afraid I'll slip and break something!Save your money and just get one of those cheap blue or green tarps."
2,Not worth it,"Definitely buy something to put under your tent. Think this would be ok on top of something soft, but not over rocks or anything slightly sharp. I used mine once and you can see where every little thing made marks in it. I will have to buy a different tarp. Disappointed in Eureka for making such a cheap product."
2,Very thin - Buy a tarp instead,"We assumed a Eureka product would be best for a Eureka tent, so we ignored the bad reviews. Big mistake. This ground cloth is very thin. For use on grass it may be okay, but after a single 2-night trip to a campground in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park it is riddled with holes from the very small gravel in the designated tent pad area. Our tent is used for sleeping only, so it gets very light traffic. Unless the small packing size of a thin ground cloth is your primary concern, we recommend buying a heavy duty tarp. Knowing what we know now, we would not buy this product again."
1,This Amazon entry is totally wrong.,"This film is NOT the 1919 film 'Communism' by animator Berthold Bartosch. It is a documentary called 'Communism: The Great Belief of the 20th Century' by Michael Rotman. The film itself is not bad necessarily, but not at all what I had expected. Attempting to return."
4,Brasil's best ska,"Hey, this group is awesome. If you like good ska then this album is perfect for you. They're like Sublime was is in America. These guys can play the guitar and write lyrics like nobody's business. I don't speak portuguese, but i'm learning some stuff, and this album is just the kind of stuff you're put on while driving to the beach. Just like they say ""nao es serio""-- it's not serious."
3,U gotta stick with it.,"A love story set in Jamaica... lemme see how it goes. The thing is, the beginning was a little sketchy and I wasn't feeling very engaged (actually was feeling a little bored) and only when she got into the mountains did I grow attached to the novel. I think the sub plots could have been developed a little more. (10 years waiting on a man?! hmmmmm). The whole Hildi plot was a story in and of itself. She's a child, wasn't there ever a time she wanted to go back home? And if there's a sexy rasta in a book... I plain ole want more than one sex scene. lol. All in all a cool read."
3,Just looking at it,"I looked at the diet, but wife and I decided on something else, which I have lost 30 lbs on another diet plan. not a book either."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,Read all the glowing reviews by readers but was very disappointed with this book. Unless you enjoy shopping at health food stores or cooking this book is not for you. Atkins also recommends exercise of one hour a day either in lifting weights or areobic activity. If I had that much time why would I need a diet book? If your a real person and like to eat real food try weight watchers.
4,Great seminal work,"Great introduction to low carb lifestyle. But, if you want to know why, beyond just loosing weight, you must look at :Good Calories, Bad Calories"
3,Good advice but a bit wishy-washy,"Anyone who's read the original Atkins Diet Revolution will get a bit of a shock when they skim through this book. It feels like more of a marketing effort, tailored to the mainstream, than traditional Atkins. They seem to have bowed to criticism a bit from the media and mainstream nutritionists.That said, the book has a lot of good information and is very well organized. I just take it with a grain of salt (actually potassium salt substitute)."
4,Low Carbs for Good Health,"It's ironic that after so many years Dr. Atkins's program for permanent weight loss and good health is being recognized. Initially, years ago, when I went on the Atkins diet, my blood pressure soared. I was eating too much of too many too salty items, like cheese and salami, etc. Today, with the help of books by Ellen and Ted Brennan, SUGAR BUST FOR LIFE and SUGAR BUST FOR LIFE PART II as well as PLAY YOUR CARBS RIGHT, a low carb regimen is effective and easy to follow: nothing white and no sugar works for me! Plus exercise, exercise, exercise. So, if Dr. Atkins was right in theory, the Brennans surely help make it easy to understand and follow the low carb lifestyle of eating. I recommend the Brennan books as great companions to Atkins for Life (even the titles are similar!)."
3,Returned This Book,"It's the same information one can get free on the website. Saw no reason to pay for it. It's good information, that's not the issue, but it's nothing new or revolutionary. And it's all on the web."
1,Not what I wanted,"Sure this explains the diet but wanted info on the diet itself, not all the wheres and whys. It was a waste of money for me."
1,I question the Motives,"Who is behind this diet ? The American cattlefarmers Association or what ? Asians Live longer, heathier lives than Americans on low protein diets. Try soy not beef you burger bandit fool."
3,"Too many ""success stories""... stick to the basics.","Was looking for a simple, straightforward ""how-to"" - this book has too many ""this is how I did it and the success I had"". I wanted a reference book - this wasn't it."
3,"Product= good, condition= embarrassing.","- I chose this rating because the paper cd cover was old and quite used, and I felt embarrassed when giving it to the person I'd bought it for.- As far as the product itself I have no clue whether it's worth the money or not since I haven't listened to it. But the Atkins diet is well respected so I figured a book by the man himself would be worth the money.- I bought this for someone I knew on the Atkins diet; I suppose I'd recommend the product to a person who's busy and has the ability to multi-task by listening to this and doing work at the same time."
2,Informational,Good advice; good information. Science and numbers provided are great guidelines. Common sense tells the rest of the story for most.
1,bad clarity,i bought these to wear while climbing and walked right off a cliff wieth them 'cus they did not filter out enough glare.
3,Not an exact fit,"I don't know if it was the original screw holes in the brand new Marlin 336A or the holes in the Limbsaver, but it was not a precision fit. I had to plug the original holes and re-drill new holes to get this recoil pad to fit properly."
5,An academic study of the failure of anticorruption efforts,"This is an excellent book. Its academic / sociological approach may put off some lay readers, but that would be too bad. The subject, and the message, are both very important. In many ways, this book is similar to ""The Appearance of Impropriety: How the Ethics Wars Have Undermined American Government, Business and Society,"" but although this book is somewhat less accessible to general readers it is certainly stronger from a social-science standpoint. An excellent book, well worth reading for anyone interested in why repeated efforts to stamp out political corruption have borne such mixed (at best) results."
5,Wind Chimes,The Woodstock Encore Collection Bronze chimes of Pluto windchimes have a very pleasant sound that I find very relaxing. They appear to be high quality construction and arrived in good condition.
5,Best I have bought,Center wood bong is just the right size. Most are too big & heavy. Nice color. Highly recommend them. Have 2 of them.
1,Not pleased at all,I am very unhappy with this chime. It doesn't chime very much. I have another chime in the same area and it is always chiming. I don't think the wooden paddle catches the breeze very well. My other chime doesn't have all the string support this Woodstock chime has so maybe that is why it can chime more freely.
2,made in china,"Not really worthy of the Woodstock Percussion name. It is tuned to a pleasant scale. Be advised that this ""27 inch"" windchime has a max tube length of about 12"". I guess they are measuring the length of the string that holds the flag. Wow. Very lightweight. Can't put it near my REAL Woodstock chimes. Glossy packaging, but they're just trying to make a ... buck. tsk tsk."
5,Joyful sound!,Sounded great from the day I put it up. No regrets. Looking to add another chime so this one won't be so lonely.
5,Sublime!,"I'm a huge music fan, with recordings from all over the world. This is one of the most enchanting things I've ever heard. This can really elevate you into a state of bliss. Swami ND has a deep connection with his instrument."
3,Stanley Food Jar,The seal on the stopper has been made smaller than it once was and allows the food to cool quicker. Overall the Stanley Food Jar is adequate but not as good as it once was.
2,disapointed,"I did my homework, reviewed thermos products (mainly food containers) this one had great reviews, and stanley has great reputation anyway. So I received it, read the care & use instructions, and followed them to a T. I never have much luck with food containers of any brand... so the first week it worked nicely, my food was steamy hot, and by the second week, my food was very cool by lunch. I asked the company why this happened and they said it could have been a care issue, or a defective product. But, Stanley being the wonderful company that it is offered to replace it. Thank You Stanley . I hope the next one works better.Dawn"
3,not too happy,"we bought this stanley bolt food jar recently and my husband fills it with very hot soup 6:30 a m and by noon its barely hot. am i doing something wrong? why do others say there soup stays hot all day?after contacting company regarding( soup not hot) they sent another stanley bolt food jar and for about a month all was fine and then the new jar quit working. my husband said he didn't drop it but it doesn't keep his soup very hot so based on our experience, we can't recommend this product."
5,Terrific food jar!,"I received this item as a gift and today is the first chance I got to try it ""in the field"". I am very happy with it as it has met all my expectations. It:- completely holds a 10oz can of condensed soup(with water)- keeps food hot. After 9 hours, I wouldn't say my soup was ""piping""hot, but it was hot enough that I did _not_ have to put it inthe microwave.- does not leak. It was on its side for those 9 hours.- has a wide mouth. Made cleaning it easier. Also, with the wide mouth,I would expect you could eat directly from the jar (rather than pouringinto the lid first).Soup is the staple of my lunch, but I am anxious to try the jar with other foods as well."
3,Only holds 16 ounces.,"I bought this food jar because I was looking for something that would hold a large amount of soup to take to work for lunch - around 20 ounces. When I received it the label clearly states ""20 ounce vacuum food jar"" but since it looked smaller I decided to measure how much it actually holds and found that it only holds 16 ounces with the lid in place. You can put 20 ounces in the jar but then you cannot put the lid on, so therefore cannot use it. This food jar does keep my food warm for about 4 hours but I am disappointed in the misleading advertising about this amount it holds."
1,Sucks,"I don't know, it worked initially and then over a short period of time it quit holding the temp, even though I prepped with boiling water. It's disheartening to have luke warm soup 3 hours later. I'll keep looking but I CANNOT recommend this - I had the first one replaced, it came with a cracked lid, I forgot to return it, so I ended buying two - neither one keeps the temp. Keep that in mind!"
5,It's the best !!!,"Love this thermos! I have been using the stanley thermos for about nine years,it is perfect for the large cans of soup and many other foods,stays very hot all day.The wide mouth and handle make it very easy to eat out of the thermous.I tell others about it all the time.Thanks Stanley for a great product and the lifetime warranty."
1,Had for 6 weeks and nothing is hot anymore,I bought this for my husband a general contractor who does a lot of outside work and after 5 weeks or so it doesn't even keep his soup lukewarm. It has no cracks no damage and it is kept inside a very expensive Yeti cooler so it shouldn't be compromised at all. I am very very disappointed in this product. I bought it and paid a bit more because of the brand and it was no better than a cheap one at Walmart. I put the soup in it while it is boiling hot at 7 a.m. and by noon it is literally lukewarm.
5,Soup Nazi,"The thermos is just the right size, it fits in lunch pak nicely and keeps the contents hot (maintains the hottest temp when full.) Especially like the stainless steel interior."
1,Stanley Food Jar,"I replaced a Thermos brand that I lost at work with this one, doesn't come close in comparison. I followed the instructions and filled with hot water before filling with the boiling hot soup. Just 3 hours later the soup is cold. I had also bought the Stanley plastic version of this with the same results, but at least I could microwave that one. Finally I gave up spent more and purchased the Thermos Vacuum Food Jar and I'm happy again. Don't waste you money on this one, looks nice but doesn't do the job!"
3,I do not believe there is a product out there to keep food hot for long,"This was my second attempt at finding a thermos that would keep my food hot for 6 1/2 hours. I put boiling water in this container for approx 30 minutes. Then I put chili in that was almost boiling as well. The thermos was left in a heated room for six hours and my food was still barely warm.I then repeated the same steps again, and wrapped my thermos in a thick towel. At lunch the food was warmer, but still was not hot."
2,Disappointed.,Does not keep food warm for the length of time as advertised. 8 hrs later food is lukewarm. I am very disappointed in this product.
2,Stanley thermos sucks!,"soup is only warm after 5 hrs. I charged it properly and everything. I have had 3 Stanley thermoses and they all suck, will not keep coffee hot for even 5 hrs."
1,Don't expect a hot lunch!,"I heated the food up so it was good and steaming hot, added boiling water to heat thermos prior to putting in food and 6 hours later the food was stone cold. I would not recommend this product for keeping hot food hot or even warm for that matter."
1,Very disappointed,"I bought this Stanley 20 oz. Thermos/Food Jar for my husband. We live in a very cold climate and he welcomes something hot for lunch when his job is such that he works outside all the time no matter what the weather. This Stanley has not worked. He says it does not keep the food hot. For the price I paid, I would have expected a better product. I had purchased one a few years back and it seemed to work for a few years. Needless to say, I am disappointed in wasting money."
5,KEPS FOOD STEAMING HOT OVERNIGHT!,"********UPDATE*********It has since (original review 12/11/09, update 2/10/11) stopped keeping things hot for some reason. not sure why.***********END UPDATE********yeah, i know, it's crazy! this thing doesnt roll, and is much less likely to tip over. it has 2 lids, one is like a mini bowl, and the other one is just the top to the thermos.*********AS LONG AS YOU FILL IT WITH BOILING/ICY WATER BEFORE YOU PUT YOUR FOOD/DRINK IN HERE AND FILL IT ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP IT WILL STAY HOT/COLD**********i tested it. i put boiling water to the top in it and put a postit with the time and came back 24hrs later. when i opened it steam began pouring out.HOWEVER, when i filled it halfway, the water was only warm."
1,not working,"Bought this to keep soup warm for lunch. Does not keep soup warm for even four hours. I have tried to find out how to get replacement, but can't figure out a contact number. I contacted manufacturer but they won't help due to having it for only two weeks. They say seller must replace. Urgh!!!Follow up. My thermos was replace by Amazon and worked great for 3 months, and then suddenly doesn't keep anything even warm."
2,Didn't last,"This was good in the beginning, but it stopped keeping food warm after about six months. I did call the Stanley and they sent out a free replacement which I thought was awesome customer service."
2,not good for cold days outside,"I bought this food jar about 5 weeks ago for my husband who works as an electrician and is often outside on construction jobs. We've found it does not keep his soup hot after several hours in the cold. It is usually just luke warm by his lunch time. We've followed all the instructions provided, i.e., hot water preps, etc. Still doesn't keep the soup hot. I also bought the coffee thurmos and it works great, but the food jar isn't as good."
5,Love This Food Jar,I love this Thermo Food Jar its the best thing out there keeps your food Very Hot for Hours
1,TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!,"I bought this so i can have a nice hot can of soup for lunch on my job. i'm a mailman and we had some brutal,snow-piling, cold days in winter. I have to tell u this food jar was like the best purchase i made in a long time! my soup was super hot and steamy 7-8 hours after i nuked it!! then one day in May in just lost its magical powers :( u can feel the warmth of the food jar in your hand:( WHY DOES THAT HAPPEN?? IT WORKS SUPER FOR 2-3 MONTHS THEN JUST GOES KAPUT! CAN ANYBODY EXPLAIN THAT?? SO DEPRESSING! SO ANNOYED! UGH!!!!HOPEFULLY THEY'LL TAKE IT BACK :("
2,Somewhat disappointed,I have had this jar for a week. I follow the directions....boiling hot water inside the jar for 5 mins then I immediately add the piping hot food. Five to six hours later it is warm at best. Maybe I expected more based on the rave reviews on this site. I am a bit disappointed in it.....if I waited another hour it would be lukewarm. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it.
1,oops,"usually so good,but this Stanley stopped working after about three months.....I used it for work regularly, need to return it."
1,You've got to be kidding,"This is the worst book on extruding that I have ever purchased -- user friendly? NO - good explanations of ""how to""? NO -- I am thoroughly disgusted"
5,New England Map,Beautiful map jigsaw puzzle. Recently in this area and will do these when the snow is on the ground and I cannot get out. Good pasttime for me and those around me.
4,An alright effort,"I wouldn't consider this to be Christy Romano's debut album as a recording artist 'cause these songs were just put together from her work on soundtracks, except for ""Dive In."" However, this is still a nice little CD to listen to. The songs are catchy, and she seems to have fun on a lot of them. Her version of ""Teacher's Pet"" is addictive and you can't help but smile when you hear the beginning of ""Say the Word."" Christy Romano is a Disney favorite and is probably the most appealing because of her character on Even Stevens, and she also sings better than other Disney divas such as Hilary Duff, Lindsay Lohan, and Ashley Tisdale. She has that special personality that just has you hooked. Her credit in Broadway's Parade and Beauty and the Beast doesn't hurt her appeal either. Even though this album is short, I think only 25 minutes, it's has a nice variety. The only song I don't really like is her version of ""Colors Of The Wind."" Besides that, she sounds great!"
3,Only if you like Disney Pop,"Christy is a good singer and a very nice person, too - but this album isnt for everyone. It's only for those who like ""kiddy music"". The lyrics and tunes are for kids and dont reccommend this for anyone over the age of 14.Christy should really come out with a REAL album which isnt a compilation of Disney soundtrack songs. That would be interesting!The best songs on this album are 'Dive In' 'Say The Word' and 'Lets Bounce'."
3,Hey now...,"To people insulting Christy Carlson-Romano's singing, while I admit that she isn't the greatest, I wish that people would stop judging her on vapid Disney pop and her stint as Belle in ""Beauty and the Beast."" I heard this young lady as Mary Phagan in Jason Robert Brown's Parade before I ever knew who the heck she was, and I was most impressed. Her singing isn't the prettiest, but she's so spunky and full of life that you just love it anyway.All of the review I've read for the show praised her, and even the toughest Broadway critic that I know of said that the cast did not have a single weak link.I agree that she's probably a better actress than a singer, but, please, before you compare her with the likes of Hillary Duff, go listen to her two songs in Parade--""The Picture Show"" and ""Frankie's Testimony."" I think anyone would sound bad when singing overly-synthesized, soul-less bubblegum pop. It really isn't fair to judge her singing just from this."
3,shes pretty good but at the same time not good enough!!!!!,im telling you i love christy carlson romano and i think this album is really good but at the same time its not that great. i think christy has a really great voise but her voise was cut out more for opera than it was for pop. I mean she played belle for the beauty and the beast the opera version. she was really good. and then you listen to her trying to sing pop and its ok but her voise just wasent really meant for it.But aother than that the album is really good with really good songs. Now if your not into the whole disney preppy girl songs like her song dive in than you most likely wont like this cd but if your sorta into that kinda of music you will totally love this cd. so i hope my review has helped you made a dession on rather you want to buy this cd or not. david lance.
1,bounce of the stage a review from kevin f,i hate chirsty she cant sing for nothing dont make a nother album
2,An average CD,"I love Christy Carlson Romano as an actress, but as a singer she is not very good. Christy can somewhat maintain the long notes in songs but really lacks a melodious voice. I was very dissapointed with most of the songs on her CD, with ""Dive in"" being the only good one. The other songs are just your run-of-the-mill mediocre pop songs. If you are looking for a great young singer, Anne Hathaway has an AMAZING voice, truly superior to Christy's. Anne sings ""Somebody to Love"" beautifully in the movie ""Ella Enchanted."" I hope she makes a CD someday."
5,Great album! Love Christy Carlson Romano!,"This is a great album! I like the work of Christy Carlson Romano, especially the Kim Possible series/films (""Say the word"" is a hit!) and her version of composer Alan Menken's ""Colors of the Wind"" from the classic Pocahontas. Highlights: Say the Word, Could It Be, Dream Vacation, Colors of the Wind."
2,CHRiSTY.. STiCK WiTH ACTiNG!,"THiS iS YET AN0THER EXAMPLE 0F A G00D ACT0R G0NE MAD.. I AM N0T A FAN 0F DiSNEY STARS TURNED SiNGERS CUZ iT SEEMS T0 ME THAT THEY ARE USiNG THEiR DiSNEY FANBASE AS A WAY T0 CA$H iN M0RE M00LAH.

1,God help us...,"Christy Carlson Romano is a terrific comedianne. She's very funny as an actress, but definitely can't sing. To contradict a previous reviewer, just because she was on Broadway doesn't mean she has vocal talent. I saw her in New York as Belle in Beauty and the Beast and was quite ticked off actually. I love the Original Cast Recording of the show with Susan Egan (now there's talent!), and expected peformances to be of equal caliber when I saw the show. Obviously I was very disappointed with the lead. Seems they only got Christy for her star appeal, hoping her name would sell tickets. Looks like they're hoping the same with this album as that is the only reason anyone would record such a mediocre performance. Beware."
1,1 Star For Dream Vacation,"This ISN'T Joseph. I am his oldest DAUGHTER.Like I said, 1 star for Dream Vacation. The rest of this album SUCKS. Christy is a much better actor than a singer and this record proves it. Below is my analyzation of every song:1. Dive In: 0/5. This song stinks. I heard it about fifty times on Disney and it made me wanna throw a shoe at the television.2. Let's Bounce: 0/5. The song title says it all.3. Anyone But Me: 0/5. Her voice is annoying.4. Colors Of The Wind: 0/5. Voice is nasal and annoying.5. Say The Word: 2/5. Catchy Beat.6. Could It Be: 0/5. she sounds AWFUL.7. Dream Vacation: 5/5. Catchy song. The only one worth listening to on this CD.8. Teacher's Pet: 2/5. Okay song. Get's annoying after a while though because Christy sounds nasal.9. Better than the song by itself. We at least have something to take our minds off the singing.In conclusion, buy this album used for Dream Vacation. Or, skip it completely."
2,Mgirl,"Christy is nice and a good actress but, I do not like her singing she is too naisil. some people said that 9 year olds would enjoy this but I disagree. I am not saying this in any offense, I'm just saying that I don't enjoy her singing. But if you are a fan of Christy. I think that you would enjoy it no matter what your age."
1,Horrible!,"This album is horrible. Christy's voice is annoying and most of the songs she sings are very childish. The only song that is sorta good is Colors Of The Wind. This album is good for the pre-teen crowd but I would not recommend it for older teens. If you want to hear REAL TALENT and a good album check out ""Breakaway"" by Kelly Clarkson.NOT RECOMMENDED"
4,Hey Now!,"Hey Hey, Don't get all over Christy C. R. I admit she's not so good but that's no need to make fun of her! I rated this high because I love the song Colors of the Wind. It's better than the original song."
4,Great find,"I purchased this pearl necklace as a gift and I am most certainly satisfied with the quality of the product. While these are only freshwater pearls they are high luster and look great. Their description on the website is a very accurate representation of how they look in real life: they are near-round, some pearls have very slight blemishes, and their color is uniform. The clasp does have a 14K stamp on it, however it does not look very heavy duty. The copy of the certificate of appraisal is an ok addition to the necklace, but I did not include it when I gift wrapped the necklace. The certificate looks a little ordinary with its photo copy look and July 2004 appraisal date. Overall I would say this is a great purchase for someone looking for a pearl necklace, it looks great and you'll have people guessing as to how much you spent on it."
4,Worth the money,"I bought this necklace for my mom, after reading the reviews on Amazon. My mom liked it very much. I saw her wearing the necklace and they look really good, especially in terms of the shining and color."
4,Great Pearls @ Affordable Price,"Great set of pearls at a very affordable price. The majority of the pearls were quite round and had good luster to them. They were a bit smaller than I was expecting, but by no means small. I'm not sure if this is normal, but the pearls towards the clasp were a tad bit smaller than the ones which would show in front. Girlfriend was really happy with it and thought they were really expensive."
2,Could have had more...,"The book did a very good job at covering the basics, but that's it. The book constantly repeated the information, and if it was meant to drill the information into the readers head, then the author must have been aiming this book at people with no experience, or intelligence. The information was dry, and the book could be reduced to a third of the size. All the information can be found on the internet. No real information on how to invest into bonds, but just what they are and how interest rates and time can change the market value of them.To end on a positive note... The book is cheap, and if you want to know just the basic information maybe to understand what your 401k is doing, then this book is for you."
3,Superstars is same as 2nd Get on the Bus,The songs on this CD are the same as the second Get on the Bus CD that came out last year. I guess they are so busy touring that they havent had time for new material. I rated it three stars because you can either buy this CD or the second Get on the bus and you will recieve the same product. My son and daughter love the Doodlebops but my son is now moving to the Imagination Movers. My daughter is all about Doodlebops still.
3,Suede shoes needed quality inspection before shipping,"I was shocked that Amazon did not do a quality check before shipping this item to me. The product is suede shoes which the suede appeared to be worn on the sides of the shoes. After further examination of the packaging I noticed that the shoes had been rubbing against the bottom of the box. It appeared that this caused wear on the sides of both shoes. I was disappointed, especially that I was looking so forward to receiving the shoes and it being my first time purchasing products from Amazon other than music and books."
3,Could be better,A few days after we bought it the arm along the side broke so it won't quite sit at a proper angle anymore without being propped up. Still works fine just really disappointing.
1,Do not buy this item,"We bought 2 of these easels and, as the previous review stated, both came without the additonal items, easel clips, paints etc as promised in the description. The easels were also not the same as the one on the picture and the one described - they were not made of hard wood but some other cheaper material and did not have the adjustable bracket that was promised. They were materially diffferent in terms of the writeable surface on the board and looked to be a cheap copy. We contacted Amazon who sent 2 further easels which were also defective. We have returned all 4."
3,Not for frequent moving,"My kids love playing with the easel... Unfortunately, a couple of days after we bought it, one of the supports that holds it together when unfolding broke when we were taking it off the table... It still works, but it looks like the latch should probably be metal and not wood given the stress on it... Additionally, it could use some rubber on the ""feet"" as it's designed to sit on a table and slides without them. For the good, the dry erase board is wonderful, and with the no-spill paint cups available separately, we've substantially reduced the mess associated with painting."
5,"A safe, calming herbal formulation.","We have an extremely nervous cat and our vet recommended we give him one of these once or twice a day...it does make him sleep a lot, but it definitely takes that ""edge"" away from him...he gets along better with the other cats when we give him this."
4,PRETTY GOOD,"the songs that tend to get annoying are*Around The World*Backdoor Lover*Money (that's what I want)Other than that the cd is great if you like the song *3Small Words- You will love most of the cd and you probably won't get tired of it because I purchased it my sophmore year of highschool...I was 16 and am now 19 yrs old and still enjoy it.. so all in all this cd is really enjoyable, other than the songs I mentioned. This is definantly a worthy purchase and I think it can appeal to someone a little older than pre teen as well as the pre teen group. The melodies found on most of the songs are definantly catchy enough to want to listen to. Don't hesitate on purchasing this soundtrack it's great."
4,Its cool its great but can be kinda be dissapointing,I bought this and thought it be great i had only listened to little clips of the songs on the web so i had no clue how boring this cd could get!!! Overall the songs are hot at first but by the 2nd time youll hear them you get so po'd and are like i just wasted 14.00 so IN MY OPION you should moderate your listening to the songs.I love love Kay Hanely's amazing vocals . So its an kinda o.k. cd but if your looking for a great cd its not this one!!!! xx taytay
1,HORRIBLE,The music is horrible. Don't waste your money. I wish I could give it a 0 because I hate Tara Reid. Her lack of talent ruined the whole movie!
3,a secret supergroup,"As other reviews have indicated, the credits on this album are sketchy, most likely to both generate press within credible music circles and uphold the mythology of some actual Pussycats. Be that as it may, though, Kay Hanley is exactly the right person for the vocals, lending her always edgy/sweet voice to Matthew Sweet's guitars. As a lifelong Fountains of Wayne fan, my favorite track is ""Pretend to Be Nice,"" Schlesinger's singular writing credit on the album. The covers fall flat, and the Du Jour songs are funny the first time (""Just because I like the back door, well that doesn't make me-- heeeey!""), but you'll soon find yourself skipping them. Not without its faults, this album does nonetheless showcase several great artists on some good songs."
5,"Marry me, Kay Hanley!","If there's only one reason to buy this album, it's because Kay Hanley sings pop again!! Please quit your day job and come back to us, Kay! We miss you!"
4,Josie And The Pussycats are truely the best band and CD EVER!!!!!!,"Josie and the pussycats have gone from tv to movie to CD and the CD is the bomb. My favorite songs on the soundtrack are spin around, 3 small words, pretend to be nice, and you don't see me. All of the songs that I just listed as my favorite are all sung by josie and the pussycats. Yeah all of the other songs are either cool or just plain alright but these songs Spin around, 3 small words, pretend to be nice and you don't see me are awesome. But all along the way it's a great soundtrack to go with a faboulous movie-Stephanie Boal-Emerson-New Jersey"
5,Josie and The Pussycats are The Best!,this cd is the best and if you don't buy it you have to be completely nuts!! you also have to see the movie and listen to the cd hundreds of times!!!
4,"Hey, you've got chocolate in my peanut butter!","Just to add to the ""critical mass"" of the reviews below, this is an amazingly good CD which should not get lost with the movie. It's like the collaborators instinctively knew how to fill in the others' weak spots: Kay Hanley has a great voice but I've always thought Letters to Cleo lacked prime material. Similarly, the only thing missing in Fountains of Wayne is some more rock punch and attitude. Viola! The end result is something like Juliana Hatfield leading Blink 182. Docked one star for the dejour songs, the short length, and the sad knowledge that this is a one-off, hopefully destined for cult status."
5,loved it,If you have a little girl who likes to listen to music and dance around the house then this is the CD you want.
4,Good CD,"This CD makes you get the advantage of listening to Poppy fun music with the feeling that your listening to Punk. It reminds me allot of the ""Sabrina the Teenage Witch"" cd (which is cool because she is also an Archie comic) This was based on the Archie comic and the movie is just like reading a two hour Archie comic."
5,A great cd,"this cd is real good i love all the songs the dujour songs are the best cause there soo funny ,the vocals are all good, and some of them are evn by the stars of josie and the pussycats, this cd has some good and funny talent."
4,if ya like the jumpy kinda rock/pop/punk...,"Although the lyrics to Josie and the Pussy Cats songs resemble the lyrics of any pop band, the beat and vocals have tons of punk/rock in 'em. These songs are awesome! they're so much fun to sing in the shower, with your tooth brush, or anywhere you feel like dancing! Three Small Words,Pretend to Be Nice,You're a star and Come On are definitely my favorites to get up and sing to. The Du Jour songs are so funny! Although you need to see the movie to understand the pun intended in the songs. I'm not sure if its worth buying the cd because you easily get tired of it when you sing it non stop. This cd is definitely a lot of fun though."
5,Awesome!,"I first listened to this CD at my best friend's-- I knew I had to have it. It's also good to know that the actresses who played Josie & the Pussycats are multi-talented (i.e. playing their own instruments, doing the background singing). I think this CD is a must-have."
3,Rock on!,"Rachel Leigh Cook doesn't sing but Kay Hanley sure does! I've haven't seen the film because it isn't out in the UK at the time of writing this review but I bought the soundtrack because I like Letters to Cleo (ever since they appeared in 10 Things I Hate about you.) Passing over the 2 rather awful Du Jour tracks the album is fast, fun and funky rock. I even admit it's better than some of LTC's albums. 3 Small Words is my favourite track. I'm hoping to see more of Kay Hanley as she starts on her solo career."
4,Great deal!,"This is the first toy I've ever owned, but I love it! I got mine for $0.79. I received it in about three days! But it came in an orange envelope wrapped in bubble wrap, so if you have any nosy people that like to snoop through your mail, don't buy this. Half the flap of my envelope was open, and the item inside was practically visible. (Be the first to the mail box if you want to keep this a secret.) The picture showed me a metallic purple color, but I got a PINK one... woohoo... plus to that. It works great with many different speeds, but be careful. Get a little over excited when using it and it can change speeds on you very quickly. That's the only downside, besides the fact that it comes in poor packaging and you pay 5 or so dollars on shipping."
1,not received,"i did not received it and you did not take any action or retutne my mony for this item , you did not take care of your coustemr.sorry to say that .my phone is +966546111102"
2,it has its issues,"This was the first vibrator I ever owned. It got the job done, but It has a few down sides. The screw kept unscrewing about 6 months after I bought it and since then it has totally died. I had it about two years. On top of that...once you tighten the screw back in it loses its ability to change speeds and sometimes it turns off while you are using it. I only paid $1.00 and I see why. Also, the packaging could have been a lot better. It cam in a manila envelope and it was wrapped in bubble wrap. This made me nervous...is it used? It makes you wonder. On top of that my mother got the mail that day and asked me what it was. I had to convince her it was candle sticks! If you live alone then thats fine, but if you dont want anyone asking questions then pass on this."
1,Is it used?,"I recieved the product in a baggie fit to the product, but it was open at one end. Is this because it product was on sale for 29cents or because it is used? Or what is going on here. This is my first time purchasing a product like this and probably the last. It seems extremely unhygenic. There was no box and the bag wasnt even sealed."
2,boreing!,"This game is really boring and easy. I comepleted this game in a half hour.Not only that, its really stupid to. They have a guy in a wheelchair that can to a slam dunk! That's what I call dumb."
1,FAKE ITEM DESCRIPTION,"YES I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT AND IT WAS NOT AT ALL AS IT STATED.I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING 10 CD AND I ONLY RECIEVED 1.I CONTACTED THE COMPANY AND IT TOOK A LONG TIME GETTING BACK TO ME.I HAD TO CALL NUMEROUS TIMES.FINALLY AT THE END THEY BLAMED IT ON AMAZON.COM FOR THE WRONG DECSRIPTION,AND I NEVER RECIECED THE RIGHT ONE NOR MY MONEY BACK.MY ADVICE NEVER ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY."
1,Mis-information,"Imation Corp 1PK 52X CD-R 700 MB 80 MIN ( 17331 )If I was not so tired when I made the order, I would have read the other reviews for this product. Like the other buyers, I thought I was getting a 10pk. Little did I know I was paying $5 for a a fifty cent disk. More fool me. A poor show on Amazons part. It will cost me more to get my money back."
2,repetitive and incomplete,"as far as an analytical guide i find it hard to believe the preface that they are a ""thinktank"" type of group providing analysis on AQ, every tactic I've read was a mediocre breakdown, i expected something with a bit more product instead of cut and paste of the same excerpts from what seemed to be the same interviews or manuals. If they had the comlete text initially in the book as opposed to snippits prior to the tactics it would have made a better book, i wouldn't buy this book unless you want to read quotes of extremist speeches."
4,Non fiction in a world full of fiction...,"Probably not one of Bob's most popular CD's.. but well done as always. I feel ""First Things First"" and ""Matters of the Heart"" are his 2 best CD's. Bob Bennett is one of my long time favorites."
4,Allow me to effervesce...,"This album was my first exposure to Bob Bennett. I should warn you, it is one-of-a-kind even for Bennett. While it has much in common with the light jazz of the mid-80s, kudos to Jonathan David Brown for the excellent production values that have kept it from sounding terribly dated. The entire album is awash in lovely melodies and tasteful playing, seemingly for their own sake, which prove the perfect counterpoint to the almost maudlin lyrics. The lyrical theme is of a thoughtful Christian wrestling with how to hold out hope to a broken world. If you like ""Dancing In The Dragon's Jaws"" by Bruce Cockburn, this album is for you."
5,Windchime,I love this wind chime! It's very pretty in person. It has a beautiful tone to it and the quality is excellent. I love the bronze color of the chimes and the wood on the top is a deep reddish color that makes it stand out. It's also a nice size. Not small but not too big. My sister saw it and really liked it too. I have a feeling she'll be ordering one!
5,super chimes,Gorgeous. Better than the pictures. Beautiful sound. I was surprised by the quality. Thank you so much.
4,Beautiful looking and beautiful sounding,"These chimes are very attractive, are well made, and sound beautiful. I have several of the Woodstock Encore chimes (all but the smallest and very largest in the line) and they are completely harmonious together. Having the variety of lower and higher pitches makes for a very melodious sound without being overly loud when the wind blows. This is actually my third purchase of this particular windchime over the years.The only thing I don't like -- and the only reason I deducted a star -- is that after two seasons, even if I bring them in when the cold weather arrives, the wood platform starts to dry out and the strings that hold the tubes degrade and break or come lose from the platform."
5,Early arrival and perfect sound as indicated,"This is a crazy good sound! It is so amazing to be able to listen to the chimes online and compare them and then pick one out. It arrived six days early, and sounded exactly as the playback indicated."
4,Great Chimes,I have 3 different sets of chimes from this company and love them all! I've had this set since 2008 and it still looks and sounds great! I have even bought them for a gift to give away.
5,This windchime is magical.,The sound of this windchime is just incredible. It transports you to another world of beauty and peace. Its perfect.
5,Exactly what I wanted,"This wind chime was exactly what I wanted. The tone is not at all tinny, but melodious and soothing. I plan to purchase more in this series from Woodstock."
3,Woodstock Chimes blames Amazon,"I ordered 2 of the same items,Woodstock Percussion AGLS Amazing Grace, Large [Lawn & Patio] (2 for $155.), they came, in the same UPS box but they were different. Not wanting to provide Woodstock Chimes a negative opinion on Amazon, I contacted Woodstock to resolve the matter. Laura at Woodstock informed me to contact Amazon, that it was their mix-up. Okay, that is what I get for ordering online, I thought...at least local purchases can immediately be returned if not satisfied.I was NOT angered until speaking with Laura at Woodstock, now I would rate Woodstock 1 STAR. Buyer beware, toooo much 'buck passing'."
4,still in box:(,I bought this for my mom for mother's day 2007. I believe it is a very nice wind chime but I have never heard it or seen it out of the box. I really don't understand her sometimes.
4,good flip flops,"I bought 2 pairs in blue and red 1 for a christmas gift and 1 for me, I prefer the red ones. I found them a little wide thats why I didnt gave them 5 star, but still great looking, great gift, great price"
4,a little bit dark,"The only problem is it reduce the light too much, so you need to operate your flash in manual mode."
3,Stofen Omni-BOunce for Nikon SB-400 Flash Diffuser unit OM-400,I am not certain that I notice much of a difference in my flash photos using this product. Will need to experiment more.
4,Nice add-on for my SB-400,"I have had my Nikon SB-400 attached to my Nikon D50 for two years and am quite happy. With this little add-on, I can now fully use my flash unit when low ceiling is not around. I would say this is a very useful for everyday application and it could have been cheaper (buying for a name brand anyway)."
4,Sto-Fen Omni Bounce for the Nikon SB-400 Flash,"Over all a Great product, takes a lttle getting use to, in order not to have your photos come out under-exposed. After a little practice, great addition."
3,Comes off easy,"The diffuser does the job of diffusing the flash but it could have a tighter fit. Mine fell or got bumped off twice. Both times, I had to go search the last area I remembered I photographed to find it on the ground. I think I've remedied the problem by putting some velcro on the flash and bounce. This seems to be holding it on for my last two outings."
3,flash cover,Small and clips on real easy. Great for softening flash shots outdoors or inside under a high ceiling (where bounce doesn't work). Handy when you need it fast and don't have time to fashion a piece of paper as a reflector.
2,Ehhhhh,I did not like this diffuser very much. It really didn't do what I wanted it to and I seemed to get bad red eye in my photos when I used it.
5,Great Diffuser,"This diffuser works well - best in spaces that aren't too large, but it gets the job done. It's a great alternative for when pointing the flash at something is too harsh, but the ceiling is too tall to bounce the flash."
5,does the job,"This diffuser is cheap, easy to use, and does the job. When possible, I use the SB-400's bounce feature to create more even, less harsh lighting. Sometimes the bounce isn't usable (e.g., outdoors or for macro photos). In those cases, this diffuser does a great job."
2,Not really worth the money,I would say this doesn't work very well at all. I would say don't waste your money and just use an index card and/or bounce your flash.
3,sb400 ombibounce,The bounce works fairly well. The lighting is a bit softer than if the flash was flat aimed toward subject. I think this will do fairly well in at night or in a nightclub where there is no ceiling to bounce light off of. It is still no where near the quality of light bouncing though. Not a terrible way to spend 11 bucks though
4,Very Good Product,"While there are DIY ways to diffuse the SB-400 flash, most of these solutions end up being tacky. This diffuser works exactly as advertised, I was very happy with the results and would recommend it to my friends. My photographs had a warm glow and came out looking natural. I gave it a 4-star, only because its a bit pricey for what it probably costs and the possibility that I may need to get a new one, if I lose this. To sum it up, this is definitely required for the flash."
2,"This diffuser is satisfactory, but don't expect great results","I use this diffuser for the SB-400 and the results are satisfactory. Having said that, you can create a homemade diffuser for less than a dollar that gets better results. I still use this diffuser because it's durable and easy to carry, but it does not perform up to my original expectations. If you are looking for a SB-400 diffuser, I'd suggest that you make your own or buy a different diffuser."
2,Doesn't do much,"I tested this item in a variety of settings and I didn't notice much of a difference between straight on flash and using the diffuser. Save your money and buy a better flash... I'll be returning this item and buying the SB700 from Nikon. I'm an amateur and found this item unacceptable, so my recommendation is simply to buy a better flash unit. It's well worth the money."
3,It is what it is,"This Knopf city guide is a handy description of the history of the various palces in Venice. However, I was looking for more of a guide to make recommendations on what not to miss, where to eat, where to shop, etc. Hopefully it will make a good walking guide book when we get there, but does not seem to help us plan."
4,Contact Lost,I purchased this product specifically with a view to learning Contact Lost in mind. Every note is accurately transcribed. The song displays Steve Morse's musical style and roots very well and its a great song to play. This book is a must for people who want to learn the songs in Bananas.
4,Bananas,"Band Personnell:Ian Gillan - VocalsSteve Morse - GuitarsRoger Glover - BassIan Paice - DrumsDon Airey - Organs and KeyboardsThis is the very first Deep Purple album without Jon Lord, after 30+ years he decided to retire from the band, and Airey directly after became his replacement, this is good album with strong riffs from Morse and it's worth a listen."
4,Excellent!! Give This One a Try.,"At first listen I was not enthralled with this album; but it's one that keeps growing on you. Now I love it. The songs have a very mature feel to them but it does rock when needed. Anyone who misses keyboard player Jon Lord; if you close your eyes and listen, you don't even know it's not him. The new keyboardist Don Airey is fantastic and already has the ""purple"" sound nailed!!!Standout tracks for me were: Sun Goes Down, Haunted(could have been an adult contemporary hit!!!), Silver Tongue(great rocker and the band have recently been using this as their set opener), Walk On(bluesy), Never a Word(acoustic but very experimental-reminded me of the Moody Blues-very refreshing),Doing it Tonight(feel good party song).If you are a DP fan, you have to give this a try. The boys put out a quality album and are clearly having a great time. It's not Machine Head, but all things considered it's pretty good and worthy of your $15.00."
1,Awful,"This is awful, awful, awful, awful. I had the good fortune to grow up with DP from their beginnings in the 60s. I saw them live about 1970. Absolutely the most awesome band in those days.They lost it long ago, and NOT with Ritchie Blackmore, who's current work is also lacking in spark, although MUCH more listenable than this.The worst of this is that it is so tiredly cynical. It makes me feel *bad*, and that gets one star from me, no matter how good they are as musicians."
4,4.5 stars for not giving up,"Yes it is derivative, yes it is the same old same old... yes the tunes and hooks are all done to death... but this is just such an enjoyable album. So what that half of the riffs are reused from their glory days of 1970s? As long as you have fun listening, as long as you catch yourself headbanging along with the relentless drive, why not? And this is definitely better than almost all of their production of the 1990s. ""House of Pain"" is fun, ""Doing It Tonight"" is fun and a very catchy tune at that, ""Haunted"" is a really nice ballad, ""Razzle Dazlle"" and ""Walk On"" are also clear favorites. Perhaps some sophistication of Fireball era is missing here but what the heck.. that was 30 years ago... oh goodness... that's a really long time ago and these guys are still chugging along and on top of that released this bucketful of hard-rock guilty pleasure. Rock on!"
5,bananas over it,"This is relly a great cd. It is definatly the best of the post blackmore era purple,They really show there versatility and don't just rest on there name for this cd.I have almost all of there albums and this one stands right up there with some of the classic purple albums.I thought there better days were behind them but maybe not , You can tell Gillian is getting older but he can still outsing most of todays vocalists KEEP ON SPACE TRUCKIN"
4,one reviewer below does not know what he said,"if one reviewer doesn't like this newest Purple album, why did u buy it? you bought it that means you are still in love in Purple okay?? Gillan is Gillan, he still prove that he is a powerful singer until today. Glover is an excellent bass player along with John Paul Jones (Ex: Zeppelin), Don Airey is not Jon Lord but he can play any keys on the board. Ian Paice is still Paicey and his excellent drumming is still like a hardrocking God....!The whole songs are excellent, but not only for Purple fans! other music fans are also welcome!Need I say more?"
3,Bananas,"If you know any song by these guys, it must be Smoke On The Water. I also have a vague memory of Highway Star and whatever else was on that album. Not exactly chocked full of energy, were they? Steve Morse, formerly of Kansas, is the new guitarist, and I think he's infected everybody. Morse on guitar and Roger Glover on keyboard, with a kicking rhythm section behind them, are on fire. Ian ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" Gillam sings as well as ever. They still can't write lyrics worth a damn, but it's hard to care. I listen to instrumentals, scat, vout, and foreign languages I don't speak, so what the heck? I have several of their new songs in my MP3 player. Mostly, though, this CD leaves you wanting the next one, which they haven't recorded yet. You can just hear so much potential. I bet you never thought you'd read these words in the year 2005, but Deep Purple is a band on the rise."
5,The Virtuosos of Rock and Roll Return,"Just got hold of this new DP epic, and all I can say is pure magic. This is one of the greatest DP records ever made. I love the diversity of the album. The songs on this cd range from pure hard rock, to heavy rock, blues, chamber music, progressive, plain rock and reflective. The ballad Haunted is mesmerizing, as are all of the other great songs. The band as usual is in top form with Steve Morse and Don Airey showcasing their talents. Ian Gillan sounds better than ever, and this just may be the best album he's ever done with the group. Nobody beats Ian Gillan these days, a vocalist without peer. Roger Glover and Ian Paice are also spectacular. BUY THIS ALBUM AND DEMAND RADIO STATIONS TO PLAY IT 24/7!! DP ARE BACK!!"
4,"Men, these guys can play!","And, more important, they can compose! The technical ability they possess is breathtaking, and it is translated to great and diversified kind of songs. Don Airey fitted perfectly, no trouble here.The cover is somehting very intriguing, don't know what it means or why they decided to use such a cover art. The songs are very good, a lot of them have ""swing"", and it's becoming clear witheach passing album that the band sound is more and more connected to Steve Morse's sound, leaving behind the shadow of Blackmore forever.I really think this album is much better than ABANDON, and at the same league as PURPENDICULAR. I'm enjoying it right now while I write this humble words.Bands like Deep Purple are somehting to be admired. Long live them."
5,"The best one since ""Perfect Strangers""","The Deep Purple members released such a masterpiece after the lousy ""Abandon"", from 1998. The stuff on here is totally inspired, negating their neeed for the arrogant and legendary guitarrist Ritchie Blackmore.All the tracks show us their fine combination of technique, composition and melody, which simply thrills us just after the first listening. We can also find the gorgeous song ""Haunted"", a soothing ballad that should be listed on any ""Greatest Hits"" from DP from now on. Buy this record and listen to it without prejudice or comparison to albums from earlier decades, because their music, as it has been for 35 years, always evolves into unexpected atmospheres and provides us the essence of hard rock."
1,"a bad dvd, twice","I ordered this DVD for my son. When we received it, my son tried to watch it and it was freezing and very crackly. We returned it, expecting to get a refund, and instead got another DVD back that was just as bad. Very disappointing and aggravating! It is not our DVD player as we are able to watch other DVDs with no problem."
1,Don't buy it :(,"Definitely not worth the money. I wanted a small camera to take with me when I travel. The only reason I gave it 1 star is because the size is right. However, don't plan on taking any pictures with it. The menus are cumbersome to navigate and the booklet does not explain what the setting icons mean so you have no idea which is correct for your setting. All of my pictures come out blurry. I've tested this thing for two days now and I've had it. I read reviews on other sites and they were fairly good so I bought it. Save yourself some money, and a headache, and buy a brand you recognize."
2,SubmitWolf Pro - useful but has serious glitches,"We've used SubmitWolf for many years. It has generally been a very useful program specially considering that the search engine list and the software is regularly updated. We have encountered one serious problem - it crashes very frequently in the middle of a submission, sometimes locking the whole computer. We have found this to be the case under Windows 98 as well as Windows XP. We've found it locks up almost one out of three submissions. Trellian seems to be aware of this problem, since it is mentioned on their FAQ page, but their suggested fix does not resolve the problem. If you are going to rely on the program (and specially if you are going to start it and want it to run unattended), this could be a serious problem."
5,Absolutely beautiful! A Master of interpretation!,"This is one of the finest classical purchases I've ever made. Bolets interpretations and artistry is one of beauty. I've never heard Liebestraum performed with such sensativity. Mt favorite is ""La Campanella"" in which he emphasizes the trills or triplets and offers up a different sound. I've never heard of him until I read a review in the paper about him. It too was an A+ review. I'm glad I purchased this beautiful recording. It will offer solace and tranquility at the end of a tough day. We certainly need a recording like this during these times. It is therapeutic. Now I know what they mean when they refered to Bolet as one of the greatest pianists of the 20th Century. He proves it here. Buy it...you'll cherish this one forvever."
3,What?!,"I don't know what CD the reviewers below were listening to, but I can hardly believe it was the same one I received yesterday and listened to--this is one CD I'm very sorry I bought. The only worthwhile piece on this CD is the Liebestraum, and even that seems a bit mottled at times, notewise, although his interpretation is very deliberate and sensitive. That track alone keeps me from giving this 2 stars. The background noise is punctuated by unpronounced but nonetheless noticeable ""hissing"" and technical mistakes in the playing are frequent enough to be noticed by even amateurs, especially in the Tannhauser Overture. I'm sorely dissappointed by this CD, and urge all those considering buying it to look for a CD with a better artist and better quality. And don't trust anything those reviewers below say is good ever again!"
5,Jorge Bolet at his best,"Bolet at his best. No doubt. Compared with his live recording at Carnegie Hall (which I have too), this recording is much better. Has more warmth. But, I am comparing the finest of the finest already. I have not heard anything better than this - especially, the Tannhauser transcription. It is very trilling to listen to Bolet play that piece."
3,Voice Lessons,So far from using the audio CD I can see it might be useful. But it was not what I expected. I really don't like any of exercises that she has you doing I wanted more of breathing techniques. But I will give it another shot and hopefully I will be successful.
1,Waste of time,"Do re me? C'mon this isn't a comprehensive course on how to sing.This is a waste of time.Basically one exercise.Whoever wants my copy you can have it free,just pay me for postage.I don't have the conscience to even charge what i paid for this crap."
1,Sorry to disagree...,"Sorry to disagree with so many positive reviews, but I found this CD of very little value. I can see where some might find it useful for warming up the voice, but even then the speed of the exercises precludes thoughtful placement and proper breathing. As a beginner looking for help in improving my breathing and volume, I found virtually nothing helpful here. As an addition to other voice exercises maybe it's useful, but if you have not had voice training before, this CD will not help develop proper technique. I finally resorted to finding a voice teacher and have never looked back."
1,No good at all,"I couldn't bear to use this CD for voice practice. The worst thing about it is that the instructor's voice is often not in tune. She also does not spend enough time on each exercise. The speed she takes each exercise starts out at a fast clip, but I'd rather start slower and then practice a fast exercise if there is a reason to sing a phrase at a fast tempo. If there's no reason to sing at a fast tempo, why practice so fast? There's nothing about this CD that I felt I could use. I'm going to stick with the program I've used and loved -- Lisa Popeil's Total Singer.The Total Singer (Deluxe Set)"
2,It's like a race....way too fast for an inexperience person.,I felt very rushed with this cd. She jumps way too fast into speeding up the tempo. It would have been nice if she focused more on singing each vocal exercise correctly through the scales. I couldn't keep up with how fast she went....it was like jumping from 0 to 100 miles per hr. Speed should not be the focus of vocal exercises....
3,Decent,"This is a pretty decent warmup cd, it will help get your voice ready to go somewhat for when you want to sing some actual songs. The major parts of the cd I disagree with however is that she gives some bad advice, and sometimes doesn't give advice at all when it's needed.She doesn't properly explain what you need to do in order to hit the higher notes in the warmups, and she also tells you on numerous occasions that you need to essentially tense up your stomach in order to hit some of the warmups. This is bad advice as singing should come naturally and you should be in a relaxed state.Other than this it is a pretty decent cd."
3,Not for Everyone,"NOt a very good disc for anyone singing rock/soul/folk. She is obviously from a classical/opera background of sorts. She goes through the scales far to quickly. Perfection must come before speed when practicing or warming up. Warm-up, There is no warm up on this disc!That being said, for an advanced classical/opera singers i'm sure this disc works well. I seriously doubt some of histories best soul/rock/blues signers could ever keep up with the ludicrous pace at which she blows through scales. In most musical genres, the ability to sign like that is simply not called for!"
4,Good tool,I find this material very useful. The teacher makes it feel like you are in actual face to face voice lessons. Technically acceptable.
4,Great improvement,"This CD was very beneficial for me because I am a singer, and this CD helped me improve my voice. It is difficult at first but very much worth it."
3,Not for beginners,"As a beginner, I wish there was more instruction on proper breathing technique and how your voice should sound, etc. After a brief description of proper body posture, the instructions launch right into vocal exercises. This would actually be okay if it didn't get so fast so soon in the instruction. My voice is just not capable of going up and down the scales so quickly. I need more practice at the slower pace before I will be able to sing accurately quickly. Unfortunately,the faster pace begins just a few exercises in. I think if you are already at a moderate level or higher, these lessons would be good vocal warmups. For me though, they just go too fast for them to be of much benefit. I plan on getting a more basic instructional CD and then coming back to this one when I am a better singer."
5,What a great idea!,This was the perfect gift for my girlfriend who is an actress. She is always having to sing at various auditions or in shows and voice teachers are so expensive out here. Considering that singing is not her main thing (acting is) these CDs were a perfect way for her warm up and prepare for her auditions. And she loves me just a bit more for buying both of the volumes for her. According to her she feels a lot more confident and vocally sound now. -Just wanted to take the time to review them since they actually are a great product.
5,a budget saver for me!,"Excellent, excellent! I have both volumes. I am an actress who needs to sing at auditions every once in a while. I have a good voice naturally and needed a way to keep it in shape. Yey! This saves me so much money in private voice lessons!"
3,"Reviewing ""Voice Lessons To Go""","I waited to review this CD. There is my feed back. This Vocalizing CD has good points to it as Ariella Vaccarino keeps it simple. However, it is annoying for those of us who are advanced or professional opera singers to have Ariella's comments in the background when the point of vocalizing is to exercise the voice well in peace and with full concentration. The over explaining I can understand as she needed to consider that every one can purchase her CD and they might not know operatic terms. The other point which I feel is lacking on this CD is that she does not take the voice high enough - for the over low parts one can just drop out as she suggests. The reason I purchased this CD was to have the exercises there when there is no piano to vocalize with. It is a good CD for beginners."
3,OK,Exercises jump very quickly into tempos fast enough that I feel it tempts you to ignore intonation for vague shoves in pitch. As if vocalists needed any training on stomping on timing and squirmy intonation.
5,love these,"I have to agree that this will not take the place of training, HOWEVER if you've been studying they are excellent for working on your own. The four CDs are my educational expense for this year and what a bargain."
4,plug and play,"This is a good, basic warm-up set. It's great having it on CD to keep me focused to get the basics done. I move on from there. Four stars are because I get slightly irritated by her singing and playing when things speed up. I wish she wouldn't sing along, nor play all the notes. I tend to turn it off and do those myself. It's good to practice with your metronome anyway, and away from the CDs so you can really hear yourself and pay attention to your pitch as well. Great for traveling."
4,"Bass, Bass and more Bass","I was recommended this CD by a friend who told me that this was the perfect CD to test out the capabilities of my new sound system, and believe me, did it give it one hell of a pounding. From ear piercing highs to rumbling, bone jolting lows, this CD has them all. My new subwoofer could barely keep up with this aural feast; it gives a new meaning to bass. The sounds on this CD are simply awesome! A must for any bass addict ;)"
3,ok as a sound fx cd,not much in the way of sonic booms but more the stereo effects of the doppler effect. a lot of trains on here and i dont know of any trains fast enough to achieve a sonic boom. but hey i do like sound fx recordings and i bought a used copy for only a penny!
5,Great for fans of the magic tree house!,"My 4-year-old son and I have been reading the Magic Tree House series for nearly half his life; they are among his favorite books (in fact, when given an opportunity at a book sale at day camp this summer, he opted to buy the next book in the series rather than the Pokemon cards that all his friends were buying!). When I showed him the Knights and Castles Research Guide, he was thrilled! We started reading it right away, and he found it fascinating. Especially appealing are the illustrations, much more numerous and detailed than those in the regular series. My only (very minor) disappointment is that it would have been even more wonderful if these books in this Research Guide series had been presented as if they were the actual books that Jack and Annie found in the treehouse (complete with the quotations that appear in the Tree House books), rather than ones they put together from ""research"" after their visits."
1,WAAAAAY Too Much,this package is valued a $500. this person is charging more than doubled that price. and you have to pay shipping. It just isnt worth it.
1,bad prices,the onyl reason im writing negitive the system it self is great but these retailers on amazon are charging murder prices i cant afford 400 dollars and i dont know any one who can right now they have to be out of there mind i hope they never sell it im going to get my system at the nintendo store in new york for the correct retail price were i can afford it dont buy it from independent sellers on amazon the;ll just rip you off its a waste of time. id recommend ebay over these third party sellers any day
1,What?,"Good luck finding a core wii system, all the fan boys bought them all so now we all have to pay ridiculous prices for one, well i got lucky and got mine for 250"
1,Did not work at all....,"Great packaging, fast shipping....easy return...Great service from Amazon!! Tried charging them few times,,,the batteries don't charge at all. I use other energizer batteries without any problems, so I guess this one was a defective product..."
3,Decent mash-up of rock songs and movie score.,"I wanted this album for the the rock songs performed by Thor and the Tritons. Its fairly cool 80's glam that sounds like a cross between early Motley Crue and Ratt. Unfortunately these decent songs are interspersed with a fairly wretched keyboard movie score (also written by Thor) and lame dialogue to form a kind of rock opera follows the plot of the film. Not terribly bad, but I'll probably make a separate CD of just the rock band. If you don't own the DVD of the movie, buy it instead, its hilariously bad."
1,where is it!,Today is June 16th. I ordered this darn chime on May the 6th (next day mail). It has not even been mailed yet. So something is messed up here with shipping. Think Woodstock is not supplying AMZN in a reputable manner. Hope you don't order a gift and get it back ordered for months. Hmm this is unlike AMZN
3,"Great coverage, but...","I read so many fantastic reviews and the product is so inexpensive I decided to try it out. The coverage is great, but it doesn't really clear up my skin. And it smells horrible. Be warned, if you use it several days in a row, it will dry out the surrounding skin and then this will stick out like a sore thumb when you apply it. But the coverage really is good."
3,Good Drying Lotion,"This sulfur will dry your skin out so it heals faster. I found this particular product doesn't blend very well with my skin. It has a strange consistency to it too. It's like whatever is in the bottle doesn't mix well so you have the shake the devil out of it and apply it before it separates. Just seems weird to me. I prefer to use ""Liquimat"". It is sulfur based and it blends better for me and doesn't over-dry my skin. Anyway, you never really know about these things till you try them. So I can't say if you should or shouldn't try this one. It just didn't do much for me."
4,It does work as well as the other drying lotion,I use this as a spot treatment after usingPomada De Azufre Sulfur Ointment 2.6 Oz Acne Cream De La Cruz(my favorite product). I can use it under my makeup but I have to use a very light hand and pat it out to blend it in. I also haveMario Badescu Mario Badescu Drying Lotionboth products work about the same for me the only difference is with the End-zit I can use during the day also. Good product if I have a problem area starting (or I think it is starting) I just pat this on it and it is usually gone in a day or 2 without becoming a huge problem.
1,I never recieve it,"Yo send me an email telling me You cannot send me this product, so how can I review it¡¡¡¡¡¡¡"
3,Very smoky organic tea!,"Lapsang Souchong is famous for its smoky flavor. The aroma is strong-tarry and smoky as advertised. The flavor is also very smoky. I am a fan of smoky tea, in particular keemun, but this was a little more than I liked. Nevertheless I was intruiged enough to continue and finish the cup. There is definitely something interesting in this strong brew and perhaps upon further exposure I might become addicted to it.Numi gets points for their manufacturing process and packaging. The boxes containing their tea is made from 100% recycled paperboard from 100% post-consumer waste--they assert that by using such packaging materials they save 2,040 trees, reduce landfill by 131,200, and prevent 184,000 greenhouse emissions. Numi uses only 100% natural ingredients without added oils or ""natural flavorings""."
2,I don't agree,"I think one reviewer was too harsh. The book was written to promote the author and his talk show. His style is like a wise-cracker, so that's his style. Two stars for that. If he had something to say I would give the other three."
1,Poor research and disappointing,"Quite honestly, from the promos, I was expecting a read that would be challenging and informative. Instead, Giles poorly attempts to engage the reader through cliches' and his own brand of catchy-phrases as ""hooks"" for the next page. Sure, his target audience obviously is not the adult market, but please, at least engage young people with intellectual acumen. My kids wanted to throw the book across the room (that would have been okay if a liberal were in the way :). Maybe wait for one to resell as ""used"" at $.95 and then get a copy. On a more serious note, Christians must learn to engage the real world with real arguments that cut to the quick and challenge thinking. Breezy and trite presentations simply will not do in a postmodern, ""truth-is-what-I-feel"" world. On a more positive note: cute cover."
1,Not helpful,"The bulldog attitude translates into an intollerant attitude toward everyone else who isn't on the same page. the author comes across as a tough guy b.s. artist. I think of the old tv commercial ""where's the beef?"" You have to wade through Giles' sloppy writing style and long-winded huffs to find anything worth remembering...or repeating."
1,cool an easie,"I got this book frum my dad and read it and can say its cool, this guy is reel tough and has the right attatude. hes reel down on my leval witch is cool becuse I can get what is sayin...this book is simple and easy like sacxool."
4,The true beginnings of rockabilly?,"These songs are all novelty record in style, so will please anyone that loves ""Weird Al"" or the universe that is Dr. Demento! These are hard to find -- in fact, very obscure and rare items indeed -- so finding them grouped so completely on this cd is refreshing. The true surprise here is that, even though the best tracks come from well before 1954, they prefigure rockabilly by many years but still sound exactly like the stuff that dominated the late fifties! Also, Chet Atkins plays lead guitar on these songs, and the recordings contain some of the best guitar licks he's ever picked. This CD is a MUST for anyone who loves quirky genius!"
4,Microsoft Mobility Pack 6000,"VX-6000 ---- 5 stars...Mouse Notebook Wireless 6000 ---- 3 stars (i've used the logitec v450 for a while, and besides its bigger size, its much more confortable for a man's hand, than the tiny microsoft mouse.)Not bad deal for $22, anyway."
3,Ok webcam but I think there is better - good mouse,"I'm not impressed with this and think there are better packages out there. First off, the package I received was in a plastic bag. I've seen much better packaging. It was particularly poor as a gift item because of the packaging.Camera functions OK but mounting mechanism is horrible. It is a very narrow clip and unusable on almost anything. It won't even clip onto my laptop let alone a regular LCD display on a computer.Mouse functions fine. As a laser mouse it does its job but it wasn't purchased for the mouse.Biggest let downs on the camera are the mounting and the button. If you hit the button it seems to insist on launching a MS webcam app. It is used with Skype mostly so this is very annoying.Really wish I'd spent the few extra dollars on a better camera."
3,"Camera is good, but mouse not working.","Bought package camera+mouse. Camera is really good, but mouse was not working. I don't really care about mouse, just need a camera, no point to do refund for 2 buks mouse."
3,Mombo Combo,Mouse- perfectCamera- needs a bit of refining. I previously purchased a Logitech camera from an independent buyer via Craigslist and am more satisfied with that camera then the Microsoft NX 6000.
5,Amazing combo!,"Great combo, with amazing image quality and wireless mouse!And everything for a great price, so it works great!"
4,Good product,I like it. It works for me. Good product.No Linux driver for the camera.The mouse is not standard bluetooth.
1,I lost money for nothing,"This is the first time for commenting.Although english is my second language ,usually I understand and feel good after watching DVD about baby.But this DVD is very difficult to following. I buy many Parenting DVDs from amazon. This one seem to be worthless."
5,Nice for the Price - True to Color,"Great, solid and substantial for the price. Nicely boxed and ""true to color"" as shown in the image ( a true royal blue). Though obviously not sterling, they are nice enough to give as a gift. The ""jewel"" may be hard plastic, but looks like it is genuine stone unless you really inspect it closely. The image does not reflect the sort of ""cat's eye"" sheen that the stones have, which actually add to the appearance of quality. My son loves them and wears them often."
3,Pretty ring,"Ring may run a little small, and the pattern doesn't quite make it all the way around the ring. It wasn't a bad purchase for the price, however."
5,So Visual . . . . . .,I can't wait to see if it gets made into a movie. I love to read Sci-Fi and this feed my appetite and was able to share it with my daughter.I'm looking for a sequel to buy!
1,Won't recommended,This cream has a pleasant smell but it does not work. I have olive skin and I applied it 2X a day and I did not see any results.
1,Didn't work for me,"Nope, didn't work for me. I've got an olive skin tone and I see no change. My armpits are softer though."
1,didn't work for me,I used this product for over a month with no results. I have no idea why people say this is pleasant smelling. It smells terrible. I would have to immediately wash my hands throughly to remove all traces of the sickening smell. It has been sitting under my cabinet unused for months now.
4,Lost Bullet,"This book is suitable for middle school grades. It's about Forensic Inspector Luke Harding, and his Mobile Aid to Law and Crime(Malc), investigate murders in a future London. The case gets much bigger when F.I Harding figures out that it is a serial killer and connects related crimes. The killer killed 3 doctors, and 3 ""pairing"" committee members He connects this to The World Church of Eternal Vision. The killer is a member of the church, but who? In the book, Luke uses this connection to catch the killer but I won't reveal the name in case you want to enjoy this book someday.I really enjoyed this book because of the desriptive clues and the heart-pounding suspense. This book kept me on the edge of my seat. But its not for people with weak stomaches."
4,"Bad movie, but a good soundtrack","The movie itself was pretty lame (What do you expect from Japanese monster movies. perfection?). This is also the only place on amazon.com where I can complain about the movie. But it is unfair to criticize the movie while I should be reviewing the soundtrack. As usual in Godzilla or other Japanese sci-fi movies, the soundtrack is one of the highlights. Worth buying."
1,Boring thy name are Fortress,"I've had this book for a while. I've started reading it several times. Only problem is by the time I get to the aliens I want to walk out into traffic. The word interesting doesn't come to mind. The phrase couldn't put it down is the complete opposite. I couldn't pick this book up. Usually I can analyze what I don't like about books but I can't with this one. I find it boring, irritating, and generaly a waste of money. If I could give it 0 stars, I would."
2,Purchase single songs instead,"I heard Ani Williams play on talk radio. I really liked what I heard; however, she played her best songs. Alot of these on this CD I just did not care for. I think purchasing the single mp3 version of your favorite Ani Williams song is a better choice than purchasing this CD."
2,"Good product, bad smell","I'm really impressed by the high SPF and it does not feel too greasy like some other sunscreens, but I couldn't use it on my face because of the strong smell. I don't consider myself sensitive to perfume, but this product gave me a whole day of headache until I washed it off. If you can tolerate the smell, this is a good sunscreen."
4,Active or not?,"This is good for active people, but make sure it dries before going out and sweating it off (it hurts the eyes). It isn't good for everyday use. I've noticed it makes my face very shiny in pictures. This is only for active use"
3,"Okay, but I didn't love it","I've got very fair, slightly sensitive and oily skin. I tried this sunblock because I was intrigued by the helioplex technology (whatever it is, is's got a clever name!). Unfortunately, I found the product too thick and somewhat irritating to my skin. I'm not sure whether this is because of the helioplex or whether all very high SPF sunblocks are like this. I usually stick to SPF 30 or sometimes SPF 45 (I love Neutrogena's Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch SPF 45) so maybe it is something to do with high SPF. So, I can't compare it to other sunblocks with the same or higher SPF, but I would say that I definitely prefer Neutrogena's SPF 45 (click here:Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock, SPF 45, 3-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 2))"
3,it is not for sensitive skin.,"After using just two days, my face began to break out. I knew it would when I opened the tube and smelled it. It smelled really nice an felt really good, but is not for sensitive skin. This was recommended to me because it is an spf."
1,Smells too much,This is an effective sunblock but has a very perfume like smell. As a melanoma patient this smell makes it unusable.
1,KP Skin Rash Flare with Neutrogena Dry Touch,"I've now used Neutregena over the course of several years. In 2009, I got a KP flare up for the first time in my life and took six weeks to figure out how to resolve. I did not connect it with my sunblock (but happened to switch products).This summer I got another rash after returning to Neutregena but I thought it might have been an old bottle. I resolved after two weeks with frequent almond oil application on moist skin several times during the day.I bought a new bottle of dry touch and used today with my arm flaring just hours later. I checked another review here and someone thought it was the moisture sucking quality of the sunblock.I need to seek out sunblock products that are approved for KP skin conditioners. Not sure if there is such a thing. I use sunblock a lot (light skin) but Neutregena only a few times this summer--with rashes twice in one summer."
1,"Terrible, leaves white film all over your face","If you wear this you will literally look like a clown. Imagine yourself, a grown man or woman, walking around with white makeup smeared all over your face. People will stare and think you look odd, and you will feel odd. Terrible product."
1,I would give it zero stars if I could,"Using this sunblock is akin to using nothing at all. It's not 70 SPF, it's more like 7. I used it -- slathering generous amounts on my arms -- and GOT FRIED. Neutragena should recall this product."
1,Do not buy this product!,"I have been wearing sunscreen for years as an active outdoors person who played tennis and swam competitively. I recently purchased this for my vacation. I applied as I would any other sunscreen, every 2-3 hours and then jumped back in the pool after waiting 20-30 mins for it to soak in. It absolutely did not work at all. I actually have sun blisters and will have to go to the dermatologist to access if I have any permanent damage. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
1,Caused me to break out horribly,"I suppose this can be a good product for this with tough skin, but this broke me out horribly. I got huge acne cysts on my face and neck from this."
2,Peels Off!,"I hate the oily feel of sunscreen and the smell usually associated with it, so I was so excited when I found this from Neutrogena. the excitement quickly wore off though when the sunscreen itself actually started peeling off! It made it look like my skin was peeling really bad. Terrible."
2,Product appears oily and caused me to breakout,Almost no products cause me to breakout but after 4 days of daily use my skin was covered with blemishes.The product also appears to be oily all day.I can only recommend for short term usage.
5,light weight!,"A lot of magazines have rate this sunscreen as the best sunscreen out there, thats why i decided to buy one and tried it for my pale and freckled skin. It was totally the right decision. Not only does this screen provided adequate protection for the harmful rays during the summer season, it is easy to apply and lightweight. my makeup goes on smoothly after applying it. i highly recommend this sunscreen."
2,Broke me out,"This had a really nice texture and dried to a nice finish and I really really wanted to like it. I burned a little when I put it on, but sunscreen tends to burn a little on my face anyway, so this was not a big deal and was something I could have lived with. Unfortunately, everytime I used it, I got big cyst-like pimples on my chin. So this product is not for me..."
2,No good for my sensitive skin.,"I bought this product last year and I got a weird red scaly itchy rash all over my face neck and ears a day after application. The rash lasted about a week. Forgetting about last year's episode, I bought it again this year and, bam, the rash appears again. I am disappointed that I cannot use this product. I must be allergic to something in it."
1,Leaves face white and rediculous looking,"It's impossible to rub it in all the way, white streaks all over my face and greasy, too. What a waste, my kids' sunscreen works better. Also it's rated toxic/avoid by EWG for containing 6% oxybenzone (Developmental/reproductive toxicity, Violations, restrictions & warnings, Endocrine disruption, Allergies/immunotoxicity, Persistence and bioaccumulation, Enhanced skin absorption, Biochemical or cellular level changes) and misleading SPF: [...]"
1,Bad reaction,Add us to the list of having a bad reaction to this sunscreen. It caused a chemical type burn on my 9 year old twin daughter's faces. We just had them into the doctor. Scary scary stuff.
2,Oily sunblock,"I didn't buy this here. I bought it because I have sensitive skin and I thought this would be a great product for my face and neck, but I just ended up getting hives on my face. This stuff is kind of hard to rub in for people with darker skin tones. I have a light-medium complexion and I had to massage it in to get rid of the obvious white streaks. This sunblock made my face look super shiny as well. It looked like I was sweating or something.At first I applied this sunblock alone with no moisturizer before and then my face would break out in hives. Then I started to put moisterizer on and let the moisterizer absorb for a couple of minutes then I put the sunscreen on. Even after than I still broke out in hives. I will look for another product after this. Another downside is that it comes in a tiny tube that is about $10 where I live. I thought I was getting a quality product but I guess not."
2,Warning for acne-prone users,"This is a warning that the Ultra Sheer SPF 55 and higher with helioplex seems to clog pores, as opposed to Ultra Sheer SPF 45. I have used the SPF 45 version for over a year with no problems. When I switched to this product, I had several pimples the very next day, only in the area where this product was applied. Comparing the labels, the SPF 45 says ""non-comedogenic (won't clog pores)"", whereas the SPF 55 product does not make this claim. So if you are prone to having clogged pores, I suggest you use the Ultra Sheer SPF 45 formula."
2,Stings!,"The protection this sunscreen gives is good and it is less greasy than many on the market (though it is thicker than the clarins I'm used to), but it really stings. I do not have sensitive skin and have never had a problem with any other product, but I almost cringe when I have to put this on."
1,STOP! DON'T USE THIS PRODUCT UNLESS....,"You test it first. I put it on my face 5 days ago. It begin stinging immediately. I washed it off. A rash appeared. It has been 5 days and my face is red, scaly and looks burned. My entire face is large red blotches. I cannot cover the rash with makeup. I am returning the product.Please don't use if you have sensitive skin!"
2,the deceit of the industry from telling us this product will protect from sun,"As most Americans, I learned this past week that all of the neutrogena products that I have been purchasing year after year have not helped to protect my skin or my children's skin. I spend top dollar on this product and I believe that the company and vendors who handle this product should offer the public who purchases this item at a substantial discount. We will be using 3 x's as much of the product as the instructions call for on the label. Until there is a product that will protect our skin from cancer, I have doubts and much fear. I have an appointment to see my dermatologist and now this information has made me very nervous. I am already a 4 time cancer survivor. I can not endure another round of this medicine that they call the cure."
1,Excellent sunscreen and makeup base,"The product was as good as the Dermatologist told us. The Dr made a presentation at a Women's Conference, sponsored by the Methodist Health Care Systems of San Antonio and this was her ""product of choice"" since it is one of the only products with a SPF 55. I was not able to find it in our local stores, and was so happy to find it online. Thanks so much!"
2,Too greasy for me,"Althouh relatively expensive, this sunblock was top rated in a recent Consumers Report issue, so I bought a tube. I found it greasy feeling. It felt like I'd rubbed on Crisco. Normally I use a spray-on sunblock from Banana Boat that leaves very little residue on my skin. I used the Neutrogena product once, then got back on the Banana Boat."
5,Excelente,"Recomiendo altamente este producto yo he usado otras marcas de protectores solares y no me ha ido nada bien, como sufro de manchas en la cara para mi es indispensable protegerme del sol y con propiedad puedo decir que ha sido mi mejor compra en cuanto a protectores solares, no es grasoso, se adsorbe rápidamente, no deja la cara blanca, buen precio ""es excelente""."
4,Sunny rays,I've used several of the Neutrogena sunblocks and they work well on your face because they don't seem to be as emollient as some of the other brands; feels less greasy on your face.
4,Good sunscreen,"Still leaves a slimy residue on your hands despite being oil free, which was the main thing i was trying to avoid. If it's supposed to help with acne I haven't noticed any after using it, but I don't typically break out from sunscreen. It's definitely less slimy than normal sunscreen, so for sports I've found it useful, if not perfect."
4,Great for daily protection but not for active water use.,"I bought a pair of the 70 spf from Costco since I didn't like how Aloegator is bulletproof when it comes to staying on your skin (not to mention blocks your pores).I surf probably 3-4 times a week, 2 hours a piece and while I like the Neutrogena it's definitely not for active use in the water even though it claims to waterproof. Any significant rubbing (like clearing water off your face), will result in shedding the block and you'll get burned in all the rubbed off places.So for me the search continues for a good block that is durable in water yet friendly on the skin. I guess the proper thing to look for is ""rub-proof AND waterproof"". Don't assume just being waterproof is any sign of it sticking to your face when you need it to."
3,"OK , but not great","I bought this item based on the reviews i read about it.I do sweat a lot during summers , so was looking for something that would stay on and would not interefere with sweating.It is pretty good as far as resistance to sweat soes , but there is a very visible white residue later on.The first time I used it, i got whitish stains on my black pants!! definately cannot use it on the face and have to watch out what colour clothing i wear , when using this product!!If you are ok with the residue , a very good sunblock.Reducded the tanning to a good extent."
4,Stings but absorbs easily and doesn't clog pores,"It's lightweight, absorbs easily and doesn't leave a white film on your face. One drawback is that it stings a bit. Especially if you get it near your eyes, which can happen if you're in the tropics and the sweat runs down your face. That said, it didn't clog my pores and did the trick. Am buying it again, given it seems to be one of the best affordable and not overtly chemical sunscreen you can get in the US."
5,The only one I will ever use again,"I LOVE this sunscreen and in the summer time I use itin place of the aveeno baby lotion I put on when I getout of the shower. This stuff rubs right in and isn'tgreasy or oily at all. It protects wonderfully. I wouldand do suggest this to anyone and everyone I see buyingsunscreen. Thank you Neutrogena, now I will use sunscreen again!!"
2,Leaves your skin dirty with white flakes,"The sunscreen does block out the sun, the problem is that it leaves residue on your skin, I noticed white flakes on my skin and some spots of what looked like dirt,,I wouldnt buy it again."
4,Great until it gets in your eyes!,"I applied this sunblock underneath my makeup before a day at Six Flags, but I actually had to apply it twice. The first time I applied it, I got it too close to my eye and it started stinging. I thought the stinging would stop after a little bit so I continued to apply the rest of my makeup. The stinging eventually got so bad I started crying and had to wash it off my face and start over with my makeup.That being said, after I applied it a second time (not getting anywhere near my eyes) it worked wonderfully all day at a very hot day at Six Flags. Didn't run into my eyes and lasted all day.Good product but don't get it anywhere near your eyes!"
2,Mixed feelings,"As the title says, I have mixed feelings about this product. I was happy that this sunblock has an SPF of 100+, non-comedogenic and oil free. However, when I put it on, it gave me a white cast and stings. Forget about it getting in your eye! Oh boy! And the smell is horrible! I also noticed that I got cystic pimples after usage."
5,Reliable,"I really like this sunscreen because it goes on so smoothly, it doesn't leave you with that nasty greasy feeling. Also, it is extremely reliable--it does it's job. And, that's important if you're fair-skinned like I am!Also, it doesn't sting/burn my skin upon reapplication like some sunscreen do to me"
1,Neutrogena Dry Touch Sunblock Will ruin leather purses and car interiors,"Do not use Neutrogena Dry Touch sunblock if you care for you leather purse or have a leather / vinyl car interior!! The chemicals they use in it will transfer from your skin and leave blotches on leather purses, leather seat covers, as well as the vinyl used on car interiors. We now have a brand new car with a ruined leather interior!Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock, SPF 55, 3 Ounces"
2,Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dr-Touch Sunblock,"I typically spend an arm and a leg for sunblock but I wanted to try something inexpensive for a change. So I decided to purchase this after hearing fair reviews on the internet. After a month of using this, I have come to the conclusion that the product was clearly not for me. I have combination skin and it seemed like it made me much oilier towards the end of the evening compared to what I used to use. To make things worst, I smile quite often and the sun block dried and clumped into my laugh lines (it looked like fine white streaks on the side of my mouth), which became quite embarrassing.I wish this was for me; it would have saved me a pretty penny."
4,Good sunscreen for the money,"It is significantly better then most of the sunscreens on the market, but it does leave a slight oily sheen on my face (no break-outs, though). However, it is made with Helioplex and is cheap compared to Lancome and Anthelios, so I have it. It smells differently and I do miss the ""sunscreen"" smell, but all in all it is just fine."
5,Best I've ever used.,"Both of my parents have had skin cancer twice, so it's very important for me to have effective sunscreen. I applied this sunscreen every morning on a two-week trip to India in the middle of summer during which I was outside for 8 hours a day, and I didn't even get a tan. It's light enough that other than a mild scent you'll barely know that it's on. The high concentration of protective chemicals does cause it to leave a faint white residue, but if you have pale complexion it isn't noticeable. This is now the only sunscreen I buy."
1,Neutrogena sunblock,"Neutrogena sunblocks all have a terrible smell that seems unnoticeable until I put it on my face. I've used many different brands and Neutrogena would be among the last I would use. The smell, even taste (probably travels through the tear ducts, while trace amounts get on the lips and in the mouth) lasts all day. I also noticed that my skin was very red, even after washing my face. Neutrogena should improve their product or take it off the market. Vanicream didn't have an offensive smell, and there are numerous alternative products that were more pleasing to use. Also consider using SPF clothing including gloves and sleeves. Even though I have been careful the last 3 years, I have just had a diagnosis of my first basil cell carcinoma. Use something!"
1,Not for me,"With all that this sunblock promises, I wonder if I've got the right product. First of all, this lotion irritates my skin. My skin starts to burn, then it turns red. The redness eventually fades away. Secondly, this lotion makes my face very oily. I use oil blotting sheets to sop up the oil, and to get rid of the shine. I wonder if the effectiveness of the sunblock is reduced by my blotting.I've used Neutrogena's Visibly Firm face lotion w/spf 20, which smells nicer, is more readibly absorbed, and doesn't make my face greasy. Only thing, it costs three times as much as the Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch."
3,No Sunburn but many zits!,"This sunscreen worked well. I did not get any redness or sunburn while out in the bright beach sun. I am fairskinned. However, I broke out in painful cystic pimples. I will not be using again on my face. Bummer!"
1,To be expired within less than 1 year,"I bought this pack of 2 last month. The expiration date is Jan/2011, which is less than 1 year.If I buy it from Walmart, it costs only $7/tube and the expiration date is 2013.I don't recommend this at all."
1,Bad Reaction,"This product made my face break out in numerous whitehead pimples. I used Panama Jack before with no reaction, but this one gave me one. Wouldn't recommend it."
1,Affirming Review by L. Croker - DOES NOT WORK,"I fully agree with the comment/rating left by L. Croker. This product DOES NOT WORK! I'm the kind of person who tans quickly and easily. Blame it on genetics. My wife, on the other hand, is extremely fair. A few months ago, I purchased 3 tubes of the 100SPF sunscreen at our local retailer because (a) it was marked $5.99 and (b) it was on sale for 25% off (they've since raised the price to $10.99). After trying it, my wife (who gardens) stated that it didn't work. I decided to test the product myself and applied a liberal amount to my face (which is very brown). After 2 hours in the pool with my 6-year-old, with minimal water contact to my face and no sweating, I came in looking like I'd been at the beach all day with no sunscreen at all - very red. My wife's reaction - ""SEE?!!!"" It appears to work as a UV accelerator and that's not good at all."
1,NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN!!!!,I thought I was crazy when my skin had a reaction. Luckily I found these one-star reviews from other people. DO NOT USE IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN!!!!!!!!!
2,disappointed,"I had high hopes for this sunscreen. I had planned to use it on every member of my family. First of all, this product has a STRONG fragrance. I find it overwhelming and nauseating. It has failed to be waterproof and sweatproof. One hour prior to going outside, we applied this to the family. By the time we reached the zoo, my son was sweating lightly and had cloudy drops of sweat on his brow. 30 min later, we had a light sprinkle of rain and each drop formed a clouded polkadot on our skin. Today I tried to carefully apply it to my son's face, only to realize that any spot that wasn't thoroughly rubbed in had dried to be slightly cloudy. Ugh! --and to think that I bought 6 bottles of this junk because it was a good price. In the end, my money was wasted."
1,hello,"This is one of the worst sun block formulations I have tried. Why?1. This product is very greasy and makes my skin appear oily all day long. In fact, someone recently asked me if I was a little warm in our air-conditioned office since they noticed how ""shiny"" my skin appeared and assumed the oil on my skin was sweat.2. When applying this product, I look like a ghost. The product is very visible and it makes my skin appear unnaturally white.3. The product flakes off. The product leaves white flakes on my skin when I apply it and these flakes are hard to remove from eyebrows and hair. In other words, the sunblock doesn't get absorbed fully into the skin.4. Applying this sunblock sometimes makes my skin turn red and stay red for a few hours.I used this product for a couple of days then threw it out, so I can't say whether or not it works. I'm currently trying other products (not neutrogena!)"
4,Good sunscreen,"Overall a good sunscreen. It goes on fairly well and doesn't streak. When I perspired or got water on it where I put the sunscreen on, the sunscreen did not run. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that it contains some ingredients that has some controversy about them. This sunscreen contains three different parabens which has some controversy about it being a carcinogenic and homosalate. I didn't know this until I'm becoming more educated about green issues. This hasn't prevented me from throwing away my unused portion of the sunscreen. After I am done though, I'm going to try out Aubrey Organics, as theirs do not contain any questionable toxins (or another brand if Aubrey doesn't work out)."
3,Ok; not very sweat-proof,"Ok. Does what it does.One thing I don't like about the Neutrogena's is that it's not very sweat-proof. During intensive/long duration exercises, the sunblock seems to float back up to the surface. My arm becomes all white & pasty again just as if I first spread it over the skin. I'm not sure how effective when it's in that state. This is true for their spf45 & 55 with similar packaging."
2,From happy to okay to allergic,"When I first started using this late last summer, I thought it was wonderful, especially because it wasn't greasy like other sunscreens. I only used it occasionally as I was trying several new sunscreens because my former brand had been discontinued. Then I noticed it made my skin feel very dry once the central heat was on and the air was drier, so I put it aside until warmer weather. When I tried it again this spring, I found I had developed an allergy to it. It makes my face bright red, swollen, itchy and tender. I bought a two-tube pack, and I am using them up on my hands, as it doesn't seem to irritate them, but no way can I put this stuff on my face or neck."
1,Very damaging to skin,"After it dried out my face, I tried it on my hands and arms - major dryness there, too, with red welts and skin loss. Use this product on a small area first and see what happens."
2,Mehhh,"1. This is not sheer.2. Difficult to apply it evenly3. Face looks whitish (specially on me as I am dark skinned)Does it offer sun protection? Cant really make out, I feel I get tanned regardless of applying this."
3,Breaks Me Out,"Although this sunblock is not as heavy as the sensitive skin version and it rubs in easier, it breaks me out. That's not a good trade-off. I am prone to breakouts so I guess I'll have to stick with the sensitive skin verzion."
4,Good product,This product is light and not greasy prefect for my skin. I had tried other products any they were not as good.
4,great all-day protection,"This sunscreen works as advertised; great all-day protection and not too greasy. However, it stains white garments and everything I have tried has failed to remove the stains. So add the price of an occasional white shirt to the price you pay for this sunscreen."
3,"neutrogena is great, but amazon price is not so great","First thing I love this product and using since 3 yrs, recommended by my dermatologist for oily skin. Got it with subscription and thought i got a great deal. But in target with $2 coupon its cheaper there. So go to store and buy without shipping hassle. LOL :("
5,good stuff,"I like this sun block. It doesn't sting my eyes and it seems to be effective. I am out in the sun a lot and I don't burn with this on, so it must work. It's not greasy so I use it under make up."
3,"Good protection, but very obvious your wearing it.","I wanted this to wear every day and I purchased because it was sapposed to be sheer and dry, not so much the case. when I wear it i feel like I should be on the set of Twilite. And it dosnt dry matte either, it actually leaves streaks. The best way to apply this product is in very small amounts."
1,Harmful,"Don't buy this sunscreen, it is harmful to your skin because of the ingredient oxybenzone (a hormone disrupter). If you don't believe me, do a little research. Just beware! [...]"
5,Dr. Recommended for a Reason,"My dermatologist recommended I use this product due to the incidence of skin cancer in my family and the previous damage to my skin from excessive and improper exposure. Due to the dry formulation and minimal scent I was able to use it at all times when in the sun, not just the beach and pool. I noticed no staining on my clothes and it didn't compete with aftershave. After a hot and sunny July week in Fl, I was noticeably tanned but suffered no burning and peeling, including tops of feet and head. It is not inexpensive but one tube was sufficient for my needs as well as facial and shoulder touchups for my two teenage girls. I would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys the sun and wants to protect their skin and their health."
5,One of the best Sunblocks,"This is probably one of the best sunblocks available. No greasiness at all and does its job really well. Have used the one with SPF 55 for some time. Since I got a deal on the SPF 70, thought of giving this one a try. I do not notice much difference in terms of effectiveness but does what it is supposed to do. Excellent customer service from Amazon."
5,Great product,"I haven't really tested it against the sun because it hasn't been sunny since I got it but as a lotion it is great. It feels and smell good when applying it and it really has a dry touch even after 2 layers. My skin did not react violently against it. It did not form balls, on top of my light lotion and underneath both my light and full-coverage foundation. It didn't clog my pores either. Basically fantastic for me. I am now scouting for the next Neutrogena product!"
4,Just ok,"Most of the songs are pretty good. It's nice to hear ""noches las hago dias"" in the female perspective. The title song is awful. It's originally sung by a little girl and this group should have just left it alone. The rest of the songs are good. The only thing is that this group should write more original songs."
1,Not For Me....,"My husband got me this CD for Christmas,because he knew I liked their music..but not this one.I didn't like any of the songs.The CD's featured title song itself would've kept ME away from buying it.Long story short..gave it to my sis-in-law..Not for me.A good alternate CD is:Isabela..same style of music."
5,This book exposes the facts and fun of human behaviour.,"Andrew has produced a technical reference on human behaviour that anyone can read and understand and will have you in stiches. This book will have you saying to yourself ""thats true"" many times , meaning you knew that but had never put it into words yourself. A great book for any member of the family."
5,The Mantovani Orch. under the direction of Mr. Stanley Black,"This is one of my favorite discs of Mantovani. I'm not a big fan of Mantovani, but yes of all good music in a good sound, as in London/Decca and Phase 4 Stereo.When Mant. die, the orchestra was directed by the great Stanley Black (one of the big stars of Decca, with Ronnie Aldrich, Franck Chacksfield, Larcange, etc.). The sound (in this CD!) is great.There are many, many, many bad CDs of Mantovani (specially those manufactered in Canada, I don't know why), but, this is really good."
5,Very good coaxial rca cable,"Very good Coaxial RCA 75ohm cable. I use to connect Subwoofer to my audio receiver. I working very good, good price too."
1,Save your money,"Dated, biased account of what happened at PARC and at Xerox headquarters. Very out of date, especially given PARC's foresight in terms of distributed, connected computers. It seems like the authors decided to bash Xerox even before they began their research. Save your money on this one. A better bet is ""Dealers of Lightning"" by Michael Hiltzik. That one points out what Xerox did wrong, and, oh, by the way, what they did right. (For example, make a couple of billion dollars out of the Laser Print industry.) The authors of this one just seemed to have it ""in"" for Xerox. I wonder if they used a windows based PC or Mac to type the original manuscript? Not without PARC, they wouldn't have."
1,Double teeth comb,"Sent this comb back to the vendor. The description failed to note that the base of the comb has teeth; for some people, this is fine, but I prefer using a pressing comb that has a solid base.I am giving this review the lowest score because it was not what I expected and does not reflect upon the vendor itself for their service was expedient."
5,For better or for worse,"This book is a must read for anyone considering divorce or who has been through one. There is nothing like ""the facts"" to set you straight on what it is all really about. Dr Hethrington and her team have done a huge service to humankind with this 20 year study. Job superbly done."
3,good overall,"overall, the dvd is worth the money I paid for it. It has a good introduction on basic exercises, and the goes on describing a few interesting fills, rhythms, etc. He's pretty funny and made the experience of drumming fun. Not the best instructional dvd for beginners, but it has a few nice features that can be relatively easy incorporated into your drumming repertoire"
1,You need to know how to groove before buying!!!!,"After taking a couple months of drum lessons; I expected to pick this up and go further in my studies. Well, this was a waste of time and money. He should have been more of a teacher and less of an entertainer. If you want super fast pace to learn more fills, then this is your video. If you want to learn how to drum and compose your own music with drums go get ""Complete Drumming System"". It costs about 150.00 bucks but it will teach you how to PLAY the drums. I wasn't looking for a video to show me rock drum fills. I want to know the essence of drums. It is hard to find a good teacher because everybody is about making a quick dollar."
2,Just OK,The CD was not quite what I was looking for. Solfedge was included on the CD but not related to actual music notes so I don't feel it was a useful tool.
1,Still avail. from one dealer at a great price?????????????????,"Wow 2,400 is all you need to have this MASTERPIECE(""cough"")in your hands. Actually saw this when it came out what I rememberis a killer in a pumpkin head murders students at HITCHCOCK(that isso MONDAY-FRIDAY...WEEK!)HIGH with of all things a lawnmower?????????Joe Don Baker reprises his Walking Tall role while Stella shows somelegs. Better off making a peanut butter and tuna fish sandwichthan watching thisNOTE I said make the sandwich DON'T EAT IT!!!p.s. who's more the WACKO??? The killer or the person who spends$2,400 on this......THIS!"
4,"Another Fine Recording from Cinncinati, and Lopez-Cobos","This recording from Telarc featuring the Cinncinati Symphonyunder Jesus Lopez-Cobos is one of the better perfomances of theRachmaninioff Symphony no. 2 that I have heard in a long while.Maestro Lopez-Cobos lets the work breathe and unfold in a naturalmanner, the music is never forced or rushed. The inner orchestralsounds are allowed their time in the spotlight. While some willsay that this recording will not replace the ones by Ormandy,Previn, or others, I say that it can be placed along side of themand not have to feel like it is second best. It can hold itshead high with any other recording of these works."
4,pages ripped out,Book was a little beat-up and a page or two had been ripped out. I didn't really get worked-up over this but rated a four instead of five becasue of this. Buy this book if you are into nature or interested in trying to decipher what life is all about. Eiseley is a bit of a downer but good comes with bad and vise-vera.
1,used bok sent as new,"I was disappointed to discover that the book, Star Thrower, by Loren Eisley, was a used book, with large red X's on 6 or more pages. I had ordered a new book, and the invoice said the book was new. I have since ordered another Star Thrower from Barnes and Noble since I didn't want to give a used book as a Christmas present."
1,Blue Skys are Calling to Sleep under,I got the song Blue Skys are calling as a free downloadIf this song brings you up the tempo of your life your life is that of someone whos on a thorazine dripone positive note its great to go to sleep to
3,Amazing album but very misleading product description,"When I ordered ""The First Days of Spring,"" I expected it to be the CD+DVD edition, since the product description said so. When I received the product, I was dismayed to discover that it was only the audio CD! There was no DVD at all, and I was really looking forward to seeing it after viewing the trailer. Why include in the product description that there's both a CD and DVD when there isn't?? Buy this album if you only want the CD, because it's very calming and peaceful. It's a bit more melancholy and reflective as compared to Noah and the Whale's first album, but very lovely indeed, with more instrumentation. DON'T buy this album if you want the DVD, buy the deluxe version instead!"
3,VERY VERY HARD,"Dragon Quest is kind of like ""Where's Waldo"", only much harder. The story concerns a race of small folk who's hair is stolen by an evil wizard. 4 of them come together to go on a mission to get their hair back. We, have to spot the supplies, friends and enemies in immensly detailed pages of vivid artwork.Me and my girlfriend read this book (or played it rather) and let me tell you, every time her back was turned I flicked to the answer pages to find what I was looking for. ""Where's Waldo"" is easy. THIS, is impossible. The stuff you have to look for sometimes doesn't even look like what it is supposed to.There are many other books in this series and if you did well in this one (I didn't) then I would consider checking the others out. My hat goes off to the illustrator (Nick Harris) for his stunning drawings. But this is too hard for me."
3,Not exactly what i spec,"i let me go with the view of the book. never knew it was for kids, i just want my super free shipping. Anyway, the book is thin but it has very good draws"
1,A Little Gross for Me,"My son thought that this book was gross! In the Woodsman's Hut cobwebs are hanging off a man's eyeballs, and in Smelly Sewers there are rats and ugly people wading in slimy green water. Giant's Kitchen has a dead dog hanging over a railing that is missing part of his leg and bugs are in the food. The Spellroom shows a boy halfway turned into a pig with electricity around his body and his shoes look like they just flew off his feet. Sailor's Rest shows a bunch of ugly, drunk pirates fighting and betting with cards, and there is a dead guy that looks like he got killed by a pirate holding a knife. But he did like Octopus Ocean and Dragon's Cave. 4 out of 28 pages to him were okay."
1,Does not work with APC 650,"Does not work with APC 650. I read the specs, it spec'ed as compatiable, received the product and it did not work. Non refundable or returnable. Money wasted on an unusable product. Went to APC website and purchased correct model."
2,Doesn't stick!,I followed the installation instructions to the letter and still no luck getting the tray to stick to ceramic tiles inside my shower. My tiles are smooth but It may be that they are too porous for the product to adhere to. Very disappointing.
4,Still holding on,"I had tried several products in the RV shower stall and they came tumbling down as soon asa bottle of shampoo was put on. This caddy however is holding shampoo, conditioner, body soap, razor anda can of gel for shaving. I am impressed and would recommend this caddy."
2,Kept Falling,"I ordered this hoping to organize my bathroom. I was looking for something that I could put in the shower and the water-resistant. I set it up on one of the shower walls, wiping it down with alcohol as the directions said and the next day it came crashing to the ground (after only one shower!). I loved that it had cleared up so much space in our shower/tub but it didn't hold up at all unfortunately. So much for water-resistant."
5,Holds up in the shower,"I really like this product. I have had the product for 3 months now and it holds up great. I followed the install instruction exactly to make sure the product sticks to the shower surface correctly. The side compartments will hold only one 24oz sized bottle of shampoo/conditioner/soap, which is the larger of the two sizes you will usually see in the store."
5,Works in the Kitchen too,"I installed this a couple of months ago in our kitchen above the sink. It's currently holding the hand soap, hand lotion, and the veggie scrub brushes and is working fantastically. I would definitely purchase this one again."
5,Easy application! Love this!!,"I've only had it for a couple of days, but so far it's been great! The application was super easy especially following the instructions. I have a bunch of odd shaped things, including a Clarisonic Mia, and it fits perfectly. I put my toothbrushes, toothpaste, Mia, Body wash, and razer in it. It holds it perfectly and feels very sturdy. I'm glad I didn't go with anything else!"
2,Doesn't Stick,"Fell off within 24 hours and only 1 use in the shower. I've had this problem with many 3M products like this that use their double sided tape, the tape just doesn't hold.The design & function of the item is exactly what I wanted though , much more useful than the type that hangs on the shower head."
5,WOW!,"I wasn't expecting much when I ordered this.. I was overjoyed when it came in though! It is extremely sturdy and well made. BUY THIS! You won't have to worry about it rusting and yes, it is plastic but it is STURDY STURDY plastic. You will be happy!"
4,Worked great!,"I wanted a shower caddy that didn't rust. I was going to get a stainless caddy, and pay the extra cost, but saw this plastic caddy, and the great reviews. I liked the smaller size, because I didn't want the soap dish. The only downside, is that it doesn't fit the extra large bottles. Plus the bottles that have odd shapes don't fit in well. I would save the smaller bottles, and fill them.Another reviewer suggested using a soft scrub sponge, and cleaning the shower wall carefully to get rid of all soap scum. Let it dry, use the rubbing alcohol pad and let that dry. The wall needs to be totally dry for the strips to stick. I have a vinyl wall, that is textured, and this tip worked great. The holders have been up for a week so far, with no trouble.Great product, better than the chrome, cheaper than stainless, and you can put as many as you need in the shower, so everyone can have their own caddy."
1,Not so good,I followed the instructions exactly. It fell the next day. WHen it was up I felt like the shelves weren't able to hold large bottles. Only a few small ones which wasn't that helpful. I bought it for the great reviews. Mine ended up in the trash.
1,2 day until everything came crashing down.,It only took two days until everything came crashing down. They can't handle any amount of weight. Don't buy this product.
3,"Mine wouldn't stick, either","Title says it all, I prepared the tire per instructions. It seemed to hold. A day later it fell, fortunately without breaking. We still use it, we just support it on top of an unused towel bar. Kind of disappointing."
2,Fell Right Off Ceramic Tile,"I love the idea, the product looks good in person but just wont stay on ceramic tile. I made sure to follow the directions carefully as I didn't want my soap and shampoo to fall and bust open all over my shower. Unfortunately my obedience was in vain. Maybe this will still to other shower materials. Good luck if you purchase this item."
5,Great for RVs,"VERY handy for storage in RVs, trailers, etc, not just in the shower. We have several in our small RV to hold items since counter space is very limited and also to keep things contained when the vehicle is in motion. The unit sticks well to the wall and the caddy can be removed from the holder for cleaning."
5,These things are great!!!,Me and my wife had these in our old shower. This was a must for our new house. Easy to apply and even easier to remove.
1,Fell off,"I followed all the directions, only had 2 bottles of shampoo it in, and still this came off the wall 3 different times. I wasted the strips it came with as well as 2 additional packages trying to make it work. I have used the smaller shelf for years but this one is a waste of money. Do not buy."
5,Great product!,"I decided to replace a suction cup soap holder and metal hanging rack with two of these. The 3M hanging strips are awesome--simple to install, fantastic hold, easy to remove, no rust (RE: metal hanging rack)...A large shampoo and conditioner can easily fit in one side. I previously had product lined up on the shower door and now it's all hidden within the shower. I like it...a lot!"
5,"Mounted Perfectly to Matte Tile in Shower, Underneath Shower Head!","Bought this for my son's apartment bathtub/shower. He didn't read mounting instructions first (what a surprise!) and he mounted the caddy directly UNDERNEATH the shower head, which you're not supposed to do. But it's been two months since he installed the caddy and it's holding firm! His bathroom tile has a matte finish and is seriously ugly, but the mounting strips are still holding the shower caddy in place. Amazing."
5,Great Shower Caddy!,"Nice, well designed, easy to clean, sticks to shower wall. It was much larger than I expected (I ordered two and only need one), but then I should have read the dimensions."
3,I so badly wanted these to work!,"I purchased 2, installed 1....followed the instructions to the letter, even left the shelf off the brackets for 2 days allowing time for the adhesive to...well, adhere. Put some half empty shampoo bottles and a bar of soap up and it crashed in the middle of the night, and it wasn't the cat's fault this time, he was in bed with me. I am considering getting some heavy duty epoxy to stick the brackets on the tiles rather than use the command strips....anyone have suggestions?"
5,PERFECT!,"I got 2 of these because I'm a shower-product glutton & we were running out of room for my poor, patient husband's shampoo. I followed the instructions to a T then loaded 2 shampoos, 2 conditioners, 3 facial cleansers, a body wash, a Clarisonic & other random junk on each side, and plopped my loofah in one of the soap dishes. 3 days later, so far, so good. They're massive, but they're sturdy & hold a ton. I might just get another for the laundry room to hold stain removers & stuff. (Told ya I liked my products.)"
5,I love the Command products!,"We have two of these and they work GREAT! The only problem I had was when I installed one but didn't follow the instructions (holding the strips against the shower wall for 30 seconds), and it fell off after a day or two. Once I followed the instructions, they have stayed up for YEARS. We have Costco sized containers of shampoo and conditioner in them and they don't budge. And I just saw that they're dishwasher safe, which makes for super easy cleaning. I can't recommended these more!"
3,One stayed up - one didn't,"I purchased two - one stuck great, the other fell off after two days - broke some bottles so that was disappointing."
5,Just the best!!,"After trying (I swear I'm not making this up) about 20 different types of caddies for the shower, I've determined that these are just the very best. They are roomy and have a place for soap and a hanger off the side but best of all, they aren't suction cups! They use the removable stickers to adhere to the tiles and really hang in there. The stickers are the removable kind, so they can be moved or removed very easily. But of course, the best is that they stay up!! I have the smaller ones for individual soaps and two of the larger sizes in two bathrooms and they work just great!"
2,Not impressed,"I've used the 3M Command Bath products in the past, I have their soap dish and I love it. As well as other bath stick on hooks. But the shower caddy would not stick to my shower. I tried almost six times to get this thing to stick, fallowing all the directions to a T. And they kept falling off. I ordered another one of these, think my first one was faulty and the same thing, would not stick to my shower wall. I really like the design of these and finally used another adhesive to get these to stick to my shower. I like how you can remove the caddy and but through the dish washer to clean it."
5,3M Shower Caddy purchased through AMAZON,"Although the caddy was slightly different than described, it serves the purpose beautifully - not too big, not too small. The Command Strips hold it securely on the shower wall and we've had no trouble with it loosening or falling. Another good point is the ability to remove the caddy from the clips for cleaning without disturbing the sticky strips."
1,Fell off the wall...,"... says it all. First time I put a bottle of shampoo in it - a week after installing it carefully - the adhesive came loose and it fell off the wall.AND, it was too late to return it. Phooey. I LOVE all the other command strips though. Too bad."
1,Does Not Stick,"Followed the instructions. Waited 24 hours. But the caddy fell off even before I put anything significant in it. Disappointed with the product. I have used other 3M products. But this time, the command strips just won't stick."
1,Useless,"Bought three of these caddies. One of the three didn't come with the razor hook; not a huge deal since I didn't need all three. Mounted all three, carefully following the installation instructions after reading other cautionary reviews here. All three fell off in less than one day. Contents of the baskets varied; the lightest load was a few small bottles and a razor, well below the stated size / weight capacity."
2,Worked great for three months then hangers snapped off the back,I loved this caddy for shampoo in my new tub. It only lasted about three months though before the plastic hangers broke off the back. I only had two small bottles of aveeno shampoo and cond and one bottle of body wash not a ton of weight. Not sure why it broke but you cannot replace the hangers just the adhesive apparently so i am disappointed.In my other bathroom I have just one of the 3m single hooks holding a standard metal caddy and it holds double the weight as this caddy and has been up over two years with no problems.The hangers on this small caddy are tiny plastic and not strong at all.
4,Designed Very Well,I am pleased with the design of this product and the fact that it is sturdy. I especially like the center space for a bar of soap with drainage slots. The two baskets help keep products separate for easy identification in the shower without glasses. The hanger for a razor does not work. I kept knocking it off.
1,Doesn't work on all tile surfaces,"I'm sure these work great on flat tiles, but my shower tiles have a bit of an uneven surface to them and the sticky tape doesn't stick to them. I really wish they worked as this would have been a perfect, no-rust option to the typical hanging baskets that go over the shower head, but invariably rust or just end up getting nasty."
2,Had trouble getting this to work,"I bought two of these. I followed the directions carefully and mounted both. Both seemed fine. One fell down and the other stayed up. Can't tell you why it fell, but I lost confidence in these and decided to go a different route."
1,complete failure,followed instructions exactly. cleaned surface with wipes. waited 24 hours before installing shelf. fell off the wall after 2 hours.
3,Thought it would be larger,"This is advertised as a ""large"" shower caddy but the side compartments are not very deep and don't hold very much. I have large shampoo bottles and can't fit them and my body wash in this caddy."
5,It Stays Up!,"I purchased 2- small caddies, 2 - large caddies and the toothbrush holder. These units have stayed put since my puchase, three weeks. They come down easy for cleaning, NO RUST! I have three in the bath/shower and one on the inside of my closet door for items. No problem when in contact with water or when put up on a door finished with varnish. No more need for pole caddies."
1,Did not work well for me,I tried 3 times to mount this with the 3M tape its all good until you take a shower then just falls right off. Yes I waited 24 hours for the tape to bond. Perhaps it is due to my matte finish tile. Good luck!
4,Easy to install....it works,This caddy is very easy to install and much handier than one of those chrome over-the-shower caddies.It took less than 10m and sticks very well
2,Does not stick to tile shower wall,"I bought this item because of the other good reviews. However, there were other reviews that complained of the same problem that I had. Perhaps this shower caddy works well on painted walls, but it certainly does not stick to tile walls even after following their directions. Since Amazon does allow free returns for defective items, you might want to buy this and try it."
3,Great idea and it works but looks cheap,Love it. Holds more than its rated at....has not fallen off or come loose. I left it up for 24 hours before loading it which is recommended. Looks kind of cheap...3M is the best but I think they could have made it look more appealing.
5,Caddy Heaven,We currently have 6 of these Shower Caddies...they work GREAT. Couldn't be more happy with this product. If you need extra space in the shower...get these!!!!!
2,Didn't stick for me,The idea is a great one and the size is perfect for what I wanted to use it. Trouble is that it doesn't stick to the shower wall.
2,doesnt stick in bathroom tiles,"this product does not stick in the bathroom tiles, I had to screw it into place for it to stay and not move. Not what I expected."
3,Didnt work as planned,"Had a smaller version for several years in my shower and it worked great. Decided to upgrade to larger unit, but still did not put anything more than what was in smaller one. I wanted the larger unit just in case ....it fell down in a week. I followed all directions to a the letter. Oh well still have the smaller one will try to go back to it, maybe shouldnt have messed with a good thing"
1,Did not work,We gave up using this shower caddy after multiple tries of getting the thing to stay up on the wall.
1,THIS IS A BOOTLEG! Kyser's name misspelled on box,"This is not an official release. Turner entertainment owns this movie, but after an initial vhs and laser disc release in the late 80s, discontinued it, and it's not been rereleased in any form since. And this is NOT the Turner release. The star's name (Kyser, not Kaiser)is misspelled on the box. Better get with it Amazon, before you get in trouble."
5,A Stand-Out,"I don't read many new graphic novels or comics these days (I'm fifty years old), but my son said I had to read this. He claimed it was worth my attention. Boy, was he ever right about that-- the art, the writing, the whole package is PERFECT! Can't wait to read the subsequent volumes.The thing reads like a brilliant set of storyboards for a smash movie. The art (sometimes reminding me of Gene Colan's old stuff) is evocative of mist and rot... that's a *good* thing here. The plot recalls Tim Powers' classic novel ""On Stranger Tides,"" mixing pirates with the undead. Horror-fantasy doesn't get better than that, and ""Sea of Red"" is of the same calibre.Well worth seeking out!"
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Vampirates. Highly entertaining. Especially when one of them starts chewing their way through a research vessel of Hollywood wankers. I will definitely read the rest of this. A film crew out to do a project find a man at the bottom of the ocean, and he is still alive. They get a lot more than they bargained for."
3,Size out of proportion,"Bought this for my husband who wears an extra large. The shirt on this costume is plenty big enough but the pants are definitely not an extra large. The ""boot"" part of the pants leg is so tight he cant get his leg into it and he does not have large legs. No seems to let out so the pants are useless. Costume is good quality for the price just sorry it cant be used."
3,"diffcult, different, beautiful","This is difficult.I really dig BT for all his work.But this one in fact seems a little bit to much like ""MONSTER""-Score into album length. I dont find as much emotion in the music, as I did in Emotional Technology or do many other reviewers here. And mybe it is just my personal view thar I would like to have seen more songs with voices like on my all time favourite album Emotional Technology or more dance-like tunes like the unbelievable Flaming June. So my personal view is only half the bar. Though the melodies do catch on, they are intriguing... it IS a great piece of music."
1,DtS 5.1 dvd does not work on my DtS equipment,Well I bought this cd/dvd for the 5.1 dts audio for it only to not work on my DtS equipment. My equipment plays all other DtS discs just fine. So I am really disappointed in my $60.00 paperwieght purchase. This is why I gave it 1 star. The dvd works fine on my POS pc with crappy speakers.oh well.Hope the DtS disc works for others on their equipment.
2,"4 for the quality sound; 1,5 for the music","The sound is very good, the DTS Track are impressive bass levels and deep detail of the instruments. Not the best hi fi sound, but very good.The music is a light juicy of new age and sounds from hi tech machines without emotion. BT was great in the ""Monster"" soundtrack (far better than this one), but in this is boring and create a techno easy listening music without soul and personality. If you don't know ""Monster"" try this one. If you know it, so don't get ""this binary universe""."
2,BT This Binary Skipping Disc,"BT made the stutter edit popular on some of his earliest production work. It was a fresh, cool technique when it was first introduced. On this disc, the technique is so over used that, combined with the digital noise samples, it sounds like the disc is defective when it clearly is not. The technique might have worked if it was used as a spice and not as the main dish. Who wants to dine on salt and pepper?This disc is overloaded with reverse samples and repetitious phrases.Some of the compositions, like ""1.618"", would have been pleasurable if it were not for the rhythm track being constructed from a myriad of digital noise and abrupt edits.A DJ does not a composer make.If you're looking for a DTS 5.1 surround mix to enjoy, try an Alan Parson's disc instead. Better music, cleaner productions."
1,"Indeed, not Emotional Technology, but...","I confess that I was hoping for some of the grove from Emotional Technology here and became disappointed that this is a different disc. But I have given this disc numerous listens and simply cannot endure it again. BT is truly a sonic surgeon, but his slicing and nano-edits here are often times painful to endure. For extended periods of time, I felt I was listening to a sound effects CD."
3,Pill,"I agree with most of Jeff's review. I have the utmost respect for Brian's music, and I own most of it. But Binary Universe should come with a warning lable: ""May Cause Drowsiness"".Update: 9/2/06 ...well, if the songs were written as lullabies, I hit the nail on the head!"
4,"Yea, the best of the best","Have you ever bought a drink thinking you are getting something else. Say you buy a 'tea' but when you taste it, tastes like 'coke'. Oh, you bought the tea flavored coke. This is how I experienced BT's Binary Universe. I was expecting that in your face, break-beat, trance, old-school BT but this CD is definitely more ambient or house. With that being said, it is really a truly amazing CD. You won't get it the first time you listen to it, but if you listen to the CD over and over again it starts to sync-in. Some of the music is stuff you haven't heard before. Maybe in 10 years, musicians, producers will catch-up.Really enjoyed track 4 through 6. Even though those are only 3 songs, they are long and change to different styles in the middle. 6 is freaking awesome.I wanted to give it 5 stars, but because I was expecting something else, I knocked off a star. Good job though."
3,Sounds familiar. Needs visuals to really shine.,"There were many parts in this work that sound like extensions of songs by Mum, which is a band I really like. I was really excited to get this CD and find out what direction BT would take his music on this new album. After several listens, I'm really not getting into it. While there are some beautiful moments on this work, overall most songs seem too long and many of the sounds/noises get very repetitive. I'm a fan of ambient music, but this really felt more soundtrackish to me. And not amazing like Air - Virgin Suicides, but just like a soundtrack. The tracks are much more enjoyable when you watch the DVD. Unfortunately, I find that bothersome because the music should be able to stand on its own."
3,Wheres the emotion?,"First let me say Im a fan of much of BTs music. So I wanted to like this, but I just found this CD featureless and devoid of personality and emotion. It just felt contrived and formulaic, like BT was working to a record company deadline. Sure, it was immaculately produced and intricate, but to what end?.The differences of opinion about this CD are interesting. Some people clearly loved it and I must admit I was influenced by the hype. But I find it difficult to play this CD right through without getting irritated by its blandness."
3,Good Ambient Listening Track,"I went into buying this CD expecting an album much like BT's earlier works, or more of a eurodance, vocal trance album. This album is not that. It is almost as I would like to call it, ""orchestral electronic/trance"" music in that it really isn't danceable, but is good for listening to and is very deep and inspiring. This album's tracks are clearly on a different level of music but not what someone who likes Techno, or Vocal Trance is looking for."
2,"IMA, ESCM, MISL fans beware","No offense to BT here. He is brilliant. However, This album is ""down tempo, ambient dub music"" with a dash of ""film score"" thrown in. If this was BT's first album it would probably be my last purchase.Each new BT release has moved a little farther away from his ground breaking trance, progressive house, and beats and breaks that he delivered in his previous albums IMA, ESCM, MISL, and to some degree in ET. This realease is in a completly different genre, so listen to the 30 second clips and know what you are buying.Note added 8/1: After having the FIRST review of this album on the site, it seems that rabid BT fans have attacked it and at the time of this note it has 4 of 14 found this review helpful. I have only told the truth from my perspective and I am sure many share my sentiments. Some of the 4,5 star reviewers are knocking this review, including posting some nasty comments on my website. I assure for the majority of BT fans this CD is not 4 or 5 starts."
2,***Wow***This***Is***Rehashed***,"Obviously certain BT fans have never heard of The Orb, Mouse on Mars, Autechre, Thievery Corporation, Future Sound of London, Aphex Twin, Black Dog, Plastikman, Moby, etc... All these acts and COUNTLESS OTHERS dabbled in these sounds in the 90s.BT is a singular artist and has earned the privilege to venture into any world at will but please, let's confine this to what it is, rehashed cinematic background music and NOTHING more."
1,BT go home.,"This may be great work, but it is not BT. Perhaps BT has got too wrapped up in technology and forgotten what made him popular. My opinion is that you will be greatly unhappy with Binary Universe if you are looking for the BT of the past. Maybe he should have changed his name too!"
5,BT- This Binary Universe,"I have to say, this is one of the most astonishing and inspirational pieces of music I have ever heard. BT has always been a musical genius, in my opinion, and this album is definitive proof. His other works are definately masters of the trance and house genre, but what BT does on ""TBU"" is show everything he as learned since he was an infant playing the piano to the more recent works and has created a musical achievement. I can't remember the last piece of music that blended new age classical pieces and ambient that had this much of an effect on me (the closest I can think of is some songs from Moby's ""Play""). Easily one of the best albums of 2006, and quite possibly ever."
4,"that's right, it's not techno","i understand how a lot of old BT fans are disappointed expecting to find beats droppped to be remixed and blasted on the dance floor. sorry, if marketers sold this as a dance album. if you are looking for the most beautiful, spiritfelt electronic music, here it is. a plus is that there are some beats injected into the songs. really, i thikn BT is just genius. this music makes my mind dream and my brain tick. this is where i go when i need a break from this world."
5,Works like a charm,"Great product for cleaning silver flat ware or I guess plate silver too. Just put into the basket, submerge and remove and it's clean what more could you ask for?"
5,Hagerty Silver Dip,"this is about the best product for cleaning silver I've ever come across....literally just dip your flatware into the solution and it's ready to rinse, dry and put away till next time ! We won't be without it !"
2,Hagerty,It didn't work very well on the piece I had. It was very black. It would work on other less tarnished pieces.
3,"Works, but use extreme caution","I'm surprised it's actually legal to buy this stuff. I didn't realize until I used it how potentially dangerous it is. It works like magic - I use it on my silver jewelry and so far it hasn't damaged anything. It's very easy to use - it has a little basket that you put your jewelry in, lower the basket into the liquid, and swish it around for just a few seconds. Presto, it looks like new! But be warned, the fumes are completely noxious and should not be breathed in. Wear rubber gloves and be extremely careful not to splash it on your skin (and certainly protect your eyes)! After dipping, wash your jewelry carefully in gentle dishsoap and warm water, then rinse, rinse, rinse and dry the jewelry well. If you have children, definitely keep this locked up and don't use it around them. It's a very strong, factory-grade cleaning chemical and I can't overstate how noxious the fumes are. Again, I'm surprised it's even legal."
1,FORGET ABOUT IT,TRIED TO CLEAN MY SLIVER PLATED RODGERS 5 PEICE TEA SET..............DID NOT CLEAN IT AT ALL......................TRIED IT ON SOME OTHER SILVER JEWERY WITH SAME RESULTS...................THIS IS REAL JUNK
1,Didn't work for me,"I was hoping this silver dip would get me out of polishing my silver plated flatware, which was quite tarnished, however, after following the instructions, it did not work at all. Although the utensils appeared a bit shinier, the tarnish remained. Oh well, back to elbow grease, silver polish, and a rag."
3,"Be Careful, very strong!!!","This stuff is crazy strong, I would really not use it on anything except maybe to occasionally dip just the tines of forks into."
4,Not a Complete Silver Cleaner,"This stuff really removes old tarnish like nobody's business. However when you get is not a final cleaning. That is the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It does only 90% of the work. You may have to dip more than once and you may need an old toothbrush to get into the engraving of tough spots. I tried all kinds of sterling silver items and they are all left with a dull yellow film. You still need a true abrasive silver polish to get your items looking right, with that fine silver shine.It does a lot, but not everything. So I gave it a lot of stars, just not all of them."
3,"Works Well, Lid Leaks","When I opened this package I thought it was just a precaution that the bottle was wrapped in tight plastic. However, when I took it off, I realized the bottle was leaking. There didn't/doesn't seem to be anything obviously wrong with the lid (ie. cracked, broken, unscrewed). But, the lid still leaks to this day.I was especially upset at having it on my hands when the warning said to keep out of contact of skin and to wear gloves when handling!The product itself works well, but I was disappointed nonetheless."
5,Excellent Liquid Dip for Silver Items,"Hagerty Silver Dip is a very good product for cleaning tarnished silverware. There is a tall basket within the bottle that lifts out so you can place your flatware or other tall/small items in the basket. It takes just seconds for the tarnish to vanish, so this is a great product if you don't have the time to sit and polish silver. The only drawback is that the product comes in a tall, narrow bottle, since it is mainly to clean flatware. However, it would be nice if the manufacturer would consider bringing out a larger container so that medium-sized items could fit in there and be cleaned just as easily. I find this an excellent product."
4,GOOD PRODUCT,I LIKE THE CONTAINER BECAUSE YOU JUST DROP THE FLATWARE IN. IT DOES A GREAT JOB CLEANING ALL OF YOUR SILVER.
5,Great silver polish with no hard work,"I've used this product for years on my silver and silver-plated items, and it never fails to remove the tarnish and leave the silver clean. For a better shine, I use Hagerty's silver paste, which adds a gleam to the items and removes any residual tarnish. I use my antique English silver-plated flatware every day (and even wash it in the dishwasher), so it gets a lot of use. Hagerty's Silver Dip keeps it shiny and ready for use."
3,Silver Dip.,"Hagerty 17245 Flatware Silver Dip 16.9-Ounce, BlackI am not overly impressed. Some of my flatware has very ornate decorations and I find that this dip doesn't remove the black edges completely."
4,Product works great,"Easy to install, works as advertised. I hear a bit of static from time to time and it seems that the dialer function is louder than the voice. Can hear great and no one has complained that they can not hear me. There are cheaper sources for the same device from others. Unfortunately, I did not find those until after the purchase."
4,An excellent genealogy aid,This book is an excellent research aid if you think you are connected to the Pippenger line. It is well researched and well written.
5,Buy this Book,"As psychotherapist I have many clients who are adult children of borderline mothers. I intend to have each of them read this excellent book. Dr. Lawson's writing is from the heart and flows like poetry while, at the same time, clearly depicting what makes these desperately ill mothers tick and why their children are so injured. I especially liked her section describing the kinds of men that marry borderline women. I know that this book can give hope to women who are borderline mothers as well as to their sons and daughters."
5,Wonderful for those who live and work with persons with BPD,"As someone who is and has been both personally and professionally involved with persons with BPD, I highly recommend this book. This is the best material I have ever seen about the family dynamics involved with BPD. Professionals will gain concrete, accurate, and easy insight into what the families of persons with BPD live with day to day. Persons who are personally involved with persons with BPD will find understanding, affirmation, and hope that they are not alone. When one is involved with a person with BPD, often the lonliest feeling is that no one else sees what you see. This book will assure you that others do see and that you can positively interact and cope with the person you love, whether that is your parent, spouse, or child. A wonderful book and a must read."
5,Great book!,"If I could give this book a million stars, I would. A lot of people compare this book to Eggshells or some other books, which I think is unfair. If you have a BPD mother in your life, this book is primarily oriented around understanding her. The other books have different purposes, which are a bit outside the scope of this review."
5,BEST book on the market for adult children of BPD!,"I am SO glad I didn't listen to the negative reviews and went ahead and bought this book. It truly is the BEST book on the subject of adult children of borderline mothers. It is the most recommended in support groups and is often referred to by others writing about BPD (especially the types of mothers with BPD: the waif, hermit, queen, or witch). I had ordered a variety of other books before this and, while they were pretty good, I found myself not finishing some of them because they didn't hold my interest, apply to me, etc. This book is WORTH the high price (although I really wish it weren't so expensive so more people could buy it!). Best thing I ever did for myself.If you are an adult child of a mother with BPD or who seems to have traits of the disorder, PLEASE buy this book. It was nothing short of a miracle for me, and countless others I have talked with in my situation."
3,"So much info, and so little","Unless you have a master's degree in psychology, you may find this book alarming. Suddenly you will be diagnosing everyone you know, including yourself, as a borderline.Lawson should have dedicated a chapter to OTHER personality disorders, and mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, so as not to confuse us.This is a good book for people who have been DIAGNOSED with BPD or who are struggling to deal with others who are. It's not a tool for amateurs. But it's somewhat of a good start."
1,A waste of money for those with sons in mind,"This book should be retitled ""Understanding the Borderline Mother: Helping Her DAUGHTERS Transcend the Intense, Unpredictable, and Volatile Relationship"". The author passes on sons feeling they will end up in prison or narsistic and marrying someone like their mother to continue the cycle. It was a real let down and after reading the introduction I dind not continue the book."
1,Outdated and Irrelevent,"This book is hateful. Written about mental illness in the early 1980's, though, that's to be expected. The first 198 pages are spent disparaging the mother, painting all BPD patients as hopeless (maybe Larson just didn't have any success with her patients?) It's full of stereotypes. Then there are short, incredibly repeatitive chapters on how adult children should cope with their ""waif, hermit, queen, or witch"" mothers.Whether too permissive with her children (""waifs and hermits""), too selfish and demanding (""queens), or just evil (""witches""), this book tells us that ALL BPD mothers are abusive and heartless, incapable of truly loving her children, nurturing them, or protecting them emotionally. It will do nothing to mend broken relationships, and really doesn't give adult children any insight into what their mothers have to cope with every day, and as a student in mental health I didn't find it helpful at all. I'm sorry I wasted my time even picking it up."
1,no pity: just a restraining order,This book implies that people should pity people with this problem...this is just a big pharma scam to label psychopaths with something they can make money from...
5,thank you Ms. Lawson,"This book opened my eyes to my own family dynamics and has greatly assisted my clients whose families fit within the described profiles. I understand there will be scepticism to any author's opinion about mental illness. I can only say that in 15 years of therapeutic practice, I have never come upon a book which so clearly described where I came from."
5,This author must have been hiding in our childhood home!,"Reading this book made me feel a part of something larger, perhaps much like those survivors of the holocaust: Only they could really know what it was like, no matter how much they tried to explain it to others. This book has let my sister and me know there are others out there who know what it was like for us. Somehow that is refreshing, letting you breathe more easily when talking or thinking about the terrors of your childhood. It was emotionally taxing, but so empowering. I do not feel the need to explore the borderline topic any further- this book says it all. Many thanks to Ms. Lawson for her book."
5,Invaluable For Understanding Borderline Parents of Either Gender,"I agree completely with the positive reviews of this book: Christine Lawson's masterful use of Jungian archetypes is helpful beyond belief in enabling those of us who are dealing with BPD parents to understand the various forms that the disorder takes. If any mood disorder does not lend itself to a one-size-fits-all classification, it's BPD.However, for those of us who were unlucky enough to have been raised by two Borderline parents, I would like to add that Lawson's archetypes apply equally well to both genders. While reading the book, I was struck by how often I could change the pronouns and see the behaviors of both my father and my mother fall into too-vivid relief. Although there are roughly three times more female than male Borderlines, it's important to remember that there appears to be very little difference in the way that both present their disorder to those around them."
5,This Book,I am finding this book to be very helpful. The author shows a clear and compassionate understanding of both the parent and the child in this situation.
3,"very interesting, but not helpful with adolescents","I am a multisystemic therapist working with at risk youth. I encounter a number of borderline mothers. This book acurately describes the syndrome and children's reactions to it, but offers few suggestions for the child currently living with the borderline. Only helpful for adult children. Also, found that not many of my mothers fit into 1 particular category, but rather fluctuate between roles."
2,Bad book,"This book was recommended by a counselor. It was depressing and basically label, name calling to categoize what kind of ""withchy"" mother you had. When I invest time and energy in a heavy subject, I want to come away with tools, better understanding or resolved feelings. This did none of that for me. More that a waste of time."
3,Clinical and Generalized,"This book was very interesting but I felt it was more clinical in its coverage than I wanted. I was expecting something more intimate, I could relate to; experiences of movie stars and president's wives long dead were less useful than say accounts by more recent, living family members. Also, the author divides BPD mothers into multiple categories, whereas I truly feel they are not that exclusive. Rather, I feel a BPD can embody more than one of them at once, and although that is slightly suggested, it's not expanded upon.Additionally, I felt the suggestions on how to deal with a BPD mother could have been great expanded and more applicable."
2,Not for borderline mothers,"I would caution all therapists NOT to recommend this book to borderline mothers. Initially, it may seem to be a tool to help them understand the experience of others who live with them. However, there is no message of hope here for a borderline parent--or, really, for the spouse of one. Instead, the experience of reading this book is very highly likely to become a very painful memory, one that, I believe, could even trigger borderline episodes. Please be extremely careful in recommending this book."
4,Excellent resource for understanding,"Understanding the Borderline Mother: Helping Her Children Transcend the Intense, Unpredictable, and Volatile Relationship - this book was a great resource to explain the types of Borderline Mothers and the effect she can have on her children. The explanations of how she treats her children and WHY were really enlightening and helps the spouse or other person dealing with the Borderline mother to gain an understanding. I definatley wouldn't label this book as a self-help book, because dealing with the borderline mother may require some really hard choices to be made which result in many cases, results in ""No Contact"". But, the advice given on how to set boundaries for each and how to phrase things are really helpful. The first half of the book merely explains the borderline types, and I began to wonder when the help was going to start, but it allowed a greater understanding so that when the advice came it made sense. A great book!"
4,Excellent resource on BPD,"I read this book from cover to cover in about a week! It was remarkable how much this book reminded me of my stepdaughter, her mother and my husband. WOW! Prior to reading this book, I'd read Stop Walking on Eggshells and I Hate You...Don't Leave Me. Both excellent books on BPD. This book gave me more insight on how this person's behavior effects the child.I was watching a bit of Mommy Dearest on TV and it dawned on me -- that this woman portrayed in the movie acted and spoke as my stepdaughter's mother! Almost verbatim -- creepy. To my surprise, when this book came, there were quotes from Christina Crawford, herself!I found the info very helpful for understanding my situation, however, I really wish there was something more about how to help children (boys and girls) cope NOW.Perhaps there can be a sequel to this book!"
5,The Best Book Ever,"This book could have been written about my mother, the waif. So many things that happened in my life were discussed in this book, just like the author lived in my household . After living 42 years in a fog, I finally found answers to so many questions no one could ever answer. I thank God for helping me find this book and I thank God for the author because this tool will save the sanity of those who live or have lived with a borderline mother."
4,you mean I'm not crazy?,"This book reaffirmed what I had always suspected: that lying, competing with her children for attention, and using degradation as punishment is NOT normal mothering behavior. It also helped me understand why my father never stepped in to protect my siblings and me from my borderline mother. If only I had understood these things when I was 10 instead of 30..."
5,Dealing with a borderline mother,"I had read everything I could on borderline personality disorder to try and understand my daughter-in-law. It wasn't until I read Dr. Lawson's book that I truly understood the depth of this disorder. She describes BPD as the mother relates to her children. I thought the book too expensive and almost didn't buy it, but if you read anything at all you should read this one. It should be required reading before ever getting married and certainly anyone trying to help their kids through the borderline crisis."
5,Very important for therapists to read,A very well written book on a subject that is difficult to understand and difficult to work with in counseling.
4,What an informative read.,"This book has alot of information and is not easy to get through quickly, but it can certainly make you think about the various things that can affect your upbringing as well as the rest of your family's relationships. Save some time for this one."
5,Tasty!!,"Fantastic, everyone loves it. I would buy this again. If you are thinking about trying this do it."
4,Hit the spot,"Not as good as tsuya fresh from Minamoto bakery, but an adequate substitute for when I need to satisfy my red bean craving."
3,Was a bit too sweet for me...,I just ate one but it was a bit too sweet for me. Maybe I'm not used to this type of taste.
3,Absolutely Effortless Prosperity,"One very good method for achieving prosperity is towrite a book on how to achieve prosperity.The author has written several books about this topic.Of course, writing a book takes some effort.This book has 30 ""simple yet profound lessonsthat will transform your life in 30 days.""The book won't do it, and the lessons won't do it either.It will take some effort on the reader's part to achievethis miracle."
5,Courageous Convictions,"I applaud Mr Kaufman for having the courage to expose the paranoia, racial distrust and cultural instability associated with Post Holocaust Judaism. My own childhood was similar. Though my parents were never in any concentration camp, they ascribed to a similar type of cultural victimology and I was compelled to be a good example for ""my people"". I empathize with his bewilderment and fear at doing anything which might rekindle his mother's sense of insecurity and marvel at how he managed to extricate himself from such a traumatic background and restructure his life without guilt. I congratulate the author for having finally escaped a self destructive cycle."
4,When the Bronx was partly jewish,"I really enjoyed reading the book. It is a wonderful story, that reads like a novel rather than a memoir. I work today in the same neighborhood were the author spent his childhood, it is amazing to realize how much it changed, but you see also the same ethnic conflicts, and the struggle of different immigrant groups to set a foothold in their new country. I highly recommend the book, it illustrates the journey of a young man to find a path for his life, which he finally finds it in the written word."
1,Runs completely out of steam,"Pardon me for saying this but this book had no business being published. The writing was facile, the story boring (who cares about this mans life? certainly not me) And when the book became interesting after his cartoonishly horrible childhood he shifts gears and writes about his becoming an adult as a footnote to the rest of the novel. The shift in style is too obvious by the end and one can only wonder whether or not Mr. Kaufman had simply run out of ideas."
3,Focused on detail but not enough,I think this book si god for people who already know about colored pencil. It is not for someone who is a beginner. Don'g be fooled and buy it thinking you will learn from the beginning.
5,Exceptional Instruction!,"This instructional book is wonderfully illustrated, has easily understood information on materials and techniques, and great written instruction. Any artist serious about their craft would get a good foundation of the basics with this publication."
3,While a slight departure from their last disc....,"...they are definately still smooth!! The only drawback to this ""most excellent"" smooth-jazz workout are the two vocal selections -- one of which is quite PAINFUL (the Mahogony theme), both of which are really unecessary, but, that is the MO of HeadsUp Records these days...throw in a radio friendly(?) tune or two and hope that the audience bites. But, I digress....Overall, the music is pure, unadulterated POD, designed to get you and your loved one ""reaquainted with the night"" -- hopefully it will keep you from thinking too much about the vocals.Anyway, I can't quite rank this one up there with their best, but, the overall mood and groove makes this disc worthy of your attention (and $).The band is still a force 25 years later!! Grover would be proud!!"
3,Won`t work if the test is sent off,"This stuff will work if the drug test is done on site, but if it is sent off to a lab, EVERYTHING will show up. Keep it in mind."
1,Terribly awful quality,"Even with the caveat that most of these commercials are pretty old, the quality of all of these videos (even the 70's commercials which, btw, aren't even the famous ones that anyone will remember) is simply terrible. The set looks like it was produced by filming with long play video and then doing some sort of other transfer.Simply terrible quality. Don't buy."
4,How Jingles Stay Buried In The Brain,"I am old enough that I remember the days before television when we would sit around and listen to the radio, though I always remember sliced bread! My mother always said TV was the best thing since sliced bread. Watching this set of old commercials was a walk down memory lane. I'm still am mad at my dad for not being the first dad in the neighborhood to buy a TV. I thoroughly enjoyed this set. More often than not, I'd start to sing along with the jingles. It was bizarre to see the old cigarette commercials after they have been banned for so many years. No wonder I smoke!!! The picture quality is not the greatest, but neither was TV back then. I was surprised that some of these survived. For a feel of what life was back in the good old days when we had atom bomb drills along with the fire drills at school and mothers always wore dresses, I recommend watching this set of tapes."
4,A serious journey to the heart of Kuan Yin,"Chun-Fang Yu's research into the evolving of Kuan Yin in Chinese Buddhist history is both thorough and scholarly. Well worth reading by those interested in the history of Chinese Buddhism or in having a deeper understanding of the part Kuan Yin plays in the lives and hearts of many.Malcolm Hunt, Brisbane, Australia"
4,it's printer ink......come on now,"printer ink is a necessity when you are in college. i have to print out things everyday for classes and work. sure you can refill ink for half the price, but that is such a hassle. if i want ink im gonna order it online. but the price is absurd!!! ink should not cost as much as it does. i recommend this ink if you need it but try and find a better price."
1,Thanks for nothing,"well,its been a week and they still havent shipped it...i can say that i wont be ordering anything from this place ever again..i coulda walked to the nearest wal-mart, bought this same product, and used it by now for the few bucks i saved ordering it online"
3,CinciBuckeye,"As with all Epson printers, the quality of the printing and the ease of use is excellent but the cost per page printed is very expensive. I do very little color printing but the cartridge lasts about 3 months. And the cartridges cannot be refilled!!! This is only one of the four colors so I spend as much on ink every six months as I did for the printer."
4,Good choice,"If you are preparing for a trip to India and you can just buy one book to learn about the culture, what to do and what to avoid, this would be my choice. It has a lot of good advice, though it might not be as colourful and entertaining as others."
4,Real Natives on film,"Video quality horrible. Audio horrible.Narration beyond horrible. So why 4 stars?Because these are the real-deal/old-ways Natives and they are on film.Men & women in their 50's-70's means these folks survived the American Holocaust escaping to Canada to live.Yes, they are ""acting"" for the camera, but these early records are so rare.After satisfying your curiousity about the soundtrack, just watch it without sound and observe the beautiful people.Watching Baluk wrestle two bear cubs bare-handed, wearing nothing but a breech-cloth or fight a pack of wolves & kill a moose with a stick(spear) must be seen to be appreciated. The man's physique alone makes one appreciate these people's natural prowness...and why europeans were so intimidated."
1,Don't buy Alpha Home Entertainment version,"The Silent Enemy is a fascinating and important film.Unfortunately, the version being sold by Alpha Home Entertainment is not the restored version of the 1930 original, but a severely shortened and dumbed-down version edited for American elementary school audiences. You can only imagine the results.While the Amazon description says 90 minutes, what I received is the 56-minute version. All of the intertitles have been removed and replaced by simplistic, offensive and generally terrible narration.Look instead for the restored Milestone Films version, if you can find one."
2,Silent Enemy,"Plot and story line was good. If you like reading subtitles the whole movie and like old black and white films, you might like this one. I don't recommend buying it."
5,Love these books...,"I had never heard of these books before I got my Kindle Fire and now I can't stop reading them. I am hoping that they make the rest of the books available for the Kindle so that I can finish off the whole series. If you like adventure and fun, I think that you would enjoy these books."
1,Divisive & Reflects Misunderstanding of ACIM,"What could a comparative tract, which promotes an ""us-Circle of Atonement"" vs. Ken Wapnick, reflect, but analysis based on a thinly-disguised slavery to conflict? All of the ""copyright, editing, interpretive"" justifications for this are unwitting, unrecognized traps for the author(s), who wind up simply promoting a group-aggrandizing school of false-orthodoxy. (Brothers, be kind to, and have mercy on yourselves, who so clearly hunger for experience of enduring verity.) This is not the miraculous ""one vision"" which flows from an understanding of ACIM. It is unfortunately the same form of sectarian divisiveness that split early Christianity itself. This wastes time, and cannot help any ACIM student."
3,Interesting but not convincing,After reading material from both people mentioned I find Wapnick's material more indepth and to the point. Perry while an enjoyable read sometimes go into the ethers and frankly leaves me observing from the earth. I will continue reading both author's works on the course and yes this book was interesting if for nothing else just to observe the opinions expressed.
4,A good read with a good plot.,"Cold Quarry is a story written well and in a way that shows, you do not need to have foul language or explicit sex scenes to make a book really good. It also makes one want to learn more about predatory bird hunting. Frank Pavlicek, the detective in this series, is a hardened detective from the old school. He is loyal to friends, loving to his daughter and is hard enough to solve the case. He is also a mentor to his dead client's young boy trying to show him there is a future after his Father's death.The story would have been much better if it had not waited for a summary chapter at the end to solve the crime and tie up all the loose ends.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for my review."
2,"Murder, government intrigue, renegade private eyes, and who cares?","This is a murder mystery, which I usually like, but not this one. It was hard to follow and I just couldn't get interested in the characters. It is built around the sport of falconry, which might have been interesting, but wasn't.There are murders happening one after another, every possible law enforcement agency has a hand in the investigation, local militia members are possible terrorists, plus plenty of other odds and ends. Some government intrigue novels are interesting; this one not so much.I would not recommend, as I could never get interested in the story. I found I didn't even care if they escaped the big explosion at the end or not!I received a free copy of this book in exchange for writing a review."
3,Slow building murder mystery,I got this book free to read and review.The story starts with a private detective's colleague being killed in a hunting accident so naturally he investigates. The story slowly builds from here with a very slowly developing story which only bursts into action at 60% (Kindle measurement). Unlike many stories it does not end with a twist but builds to a logical conclusion. There are however some gaps in the plot and some continuity is missing but I still thought it was OK rather than good.
2,Starting to read just like the first one.,"I hope this second Frank Pavlicek book (for me) isn't an omen of the same old, same old. While the scenario is different from the first, there are many similarities and the hero and his friends are regurgitated."
5,A good condom...,They really are easier to put on...The shape seems better and they work plain and simple!
1,rip off,I bought part four in this series . Two guys sitting on a sofa discussing project management. Don't buy it is a total rip off. These people should be ashamed of themselves.
5,Thought provoking.,I'm still reading and know I will be reading it more than once. Makes you think which is always a good thing. I love the treasures Francis Frangipane uncovers in God's word.
5,THE BEST CHRISTIAN BOOK FOR THOSE WHO TRULY WANT TO GROW IN CHRIST!,"This is one of the only books I have re-read. In fact, I have re-read it three times so far.It is based strongly on scripture, and it is very apparent that God has blessed Frangipane with His wisdom, discernment, and revelation.Frangipane and John Eldredge are two Christian authors that God has blessed and grown me greatly in reading their materials. God bless them and all of us desiring to truly grow and know the Lord!"
5,A signpost on the 'narrow road'...,"For those who want a more intimate relationship with the Lord, for those who want a deeper, more meaningful walk in their faith, for those who need their hope in Christ rekindled afresh, this book is for you.Mr. Frangipane is one of the best (if not 'the' best) modern-day Christian writers that we have been blessed with. This book is likely his very best, and with good reason. It focuses on the dynamic, essential, basic relationship believers have with their God.The discourse on the holiness of God is astute - as is the message about the Truth. The church needs to learn anew what the holiness of God is, what His reverent holy presence means to us, and how we should rightly respond to said-same.This is one of those titles that every Christian should have on their bookshelves, especially those who desire a more dynamic and vital relationship with the Lord.Can't recommend this one highly enough."
5,A book every Christian should read!,"This is one of the greatest books that I have ever read. Not only have I read it, but I read it six times. Each time was even more insightful then the last. Every Christian sould invest the money to purchase this book and the time to read it. It will literaly change your life."
5,Excellent book !!!!!!,I have the awesome responsibility of caring for my 1 year old grand daughter while her mom works. I spent hours searching the internet for teaching resources to use with her. I am so thankful that I came across this book. It is just the tool that I was looking for. The activities are lableled by age. The book is put together very well. Caregivers and children will greatly benefit from the contents.
3,Obsolete,"It would have bewen nice to know that it wasn't compatable with todays operating systems.But, I'm not too worried about it... I should have figured that out myself."
4,Easy to use,"This is a simple book of Bible verses that a couple could pray for whatever they're going through in their marriage. Topics like anger, financial problems, and courage are arranged alphabetically. You can be sure that you're praying God's will when you pray His word back to Him."
3,The Decline of a Master,"Feist is churning out book after book and each saga seems to be loosing the magic of his earlier one's. This was an average book but paled in comparisson to his previous tales. I don't know why he decided to move back to this point in the history of Midkemia instead of finnishing off where he left off at the end of Shards of A Broken Crown. I am trully dissapointed althoug he remains my number 1 author. All said, this book is still worth reading!"
4,Much stronger than the first!,"What an ominous ending!! I liked this middle book even more than the first book! It was a lot more exciting! Jimmy the Hand is a wonderful creation and William is quite likable as well. Not to mention the surprise cameo of my favorite character, Amos Trask! The plot unfolded more creatively and in a much more exciting manner than the first book and I am interested to see how everything will be solved in the third part - though, really, this book did not seem to connect to _Krondor, The Betrayal_ as much as I would have expected, but perhaps the third volume will link everything together."
3,"Weak series for Feist, but the best of the three","Although I was first drawn into Feist's work through the Betrayal at Krondor video game in the mid-90s, I now recognize that the Riftwar Legacy is a very weak series by Feist's normal standards. If you were a fan of the game or if you are just a Riftwar junkie, you will enjoy revisiting old characters. Although Assassins is the best of the three (and the only one not based on a video game), it lacks the quality and epic nature of the Riftwar series itself. Do yourself a favor and read the Magician books, Silverthorn, and A Darkness at Sethanon before you read Krondor the Assassins. If you fall in love with Midkemia, then consider this book a fun little romp that is worth reading. Still, it's near bottom of the barrel by Feist's normally high standards."
2,Fluffy bunny,I love Raymond Feist but he has a tendancy to call it in once every 3-4 books. This book is enjoyable but not worthy of mention in comparison to other Feist novels. Read Magician or Silverthorn over before picking this up in hardcover.
3,A good adventure but we need more Pug and Magic,The story is a good basic adventure story. The problem is that Feist has gone somewhat astray from the Magician Books that started the series. Those books had a good mixture of both Magic and adventure. The latest novels seem to be neglecting the whole magic side of the equation. We need more PUG ! I want to know things like : What is Pug's role as Macros' successor ? What's happening with the Valheru? Stories on the God Wars would be interesting as well.
3,A Shadow of Itself,"I like Jimmy the Hand and Prince Arutha, which is why I at least liked reading Assasins. However, the first two books on this series have the feel of a video game, which they are adapted from. The story moves from situation to situation and I never really got caught up in the story. By the end, I was just reading because I enjoy when Jimmy is on the page. I've been a fan since Magician, but everything since then has not measured up to that debut effort."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Stop killing us please, we are only criminals.The Mockers have problems with the return of the Assassins' Guild, in that, well, Assassins kill people quite well, including thieves.James and some help get to do some of the more spook sort of policework to try and work out what is going on.Being a Feist fantasy, not going to be that simple, so expect monsters and magic before it all works out."
5,Feist does it again,"I know I'm prejudiced in my review because Raymond E. Feist has always been my favorite author, however this book has it all.It's probably not a great book if you haven't read the Riftwar saga which I wholeheartedly recommend you read first.This book is a great return to that world and the characters in it. As that world has changed over the years with new books some characters are sadly gone. Without spoiling anything, these books falling in the middle of the timespan of all the books, bring back some characters and it's like seeing old friends again.I always look forward to new Feist/Riftwar-world novels and hope for many more in the years to come.If I had to give one downside to this book was that it was short (being an adaptation of a video game) and was over much quicker than I would have liked."
3,Not Feist's best,"Although I enjoy the increased focus on 2 of my favorite characters, James and Arutha, it is hard to determine what Feist is hoping to accomplish by writing these novels. Both Krondor novels fail to provide any viable bridge between the Rift war and the Serpent War. They neither introduce intermediary characters such as ""Prince of the Blood"" and ""Kings Buccaneer"" had nor do they provide any new insights into James and Arutha's relationship. They are best friends, we don't need two half baked novels to tell us that over and over again."
3,"A nice read, but not very deep","While veteran readers know all about Jimmy the Hand, Arutha and William, I thought the characterization of the secondary characters was thin. You don't get the opportunites to understand their motives and the reasons for their actions like you do in the other series'. I also was disappointed in the second half of the book which I felt could have been much deeper and involved than it turned out to be. It is a solid story and a good read, but not Feist's best work."
4,Feist Plays Hookey in his own World,"I gave this fluff a four - which it really doesn't deserve but...Jimmy and Arutha are my favorite characters in the Midkemia world...and Assassins is head and shoulders above Betrayal. And even though we are clearly set up for books 3, 4 etc., I'd rather have mediocre Feist than no Feist at all. Feist makes Assassins a stronger book by concentrating its limited plot line on Squire James and his Prince. Betrayal had a 'Whoo! Where did that come from.' quality that...well...betrayed the reader. Assassins is much more tightly plotted. I can see how this novel is structured after a video game: fighting in the Nighthawks underground fortress is clearly level x...but it doesn't wack you in the head with it. And, for the most part, I didn't feel I was reading something written for computer geeks who want a further game fix. So I guess I'll be waiting for book 3... Krondor, the Misdemeanor?"
4,Suprisingly Good,"I must say that after reading the first book of the Riftwar Legacy, I almost didn't bother to read this one. I was pleasantly surprised though with this second book of the series. This book has a good story and I found myself not wanting to put it down. It's major drawback is that a few of the passages are awkwardly written, and one may need to read some of the passages carefully to avoid confusion. All in all though, I would say that this is a worthwile book to own and it is a great improvement over the first book in this series."
3,I Nearly Lost Track!,"Although I still think Feist is one of the greatest plot writers, he's not doing his best in this book. If I have to say which one was better, I'd say Betrayal was better in a sense of suspense and it was slightly funnier.The characters in this book are slightly better developed than usual and I think the plot is pretty good considering how we can follow James and William. However this book can lose suspense in the middle, but it gets better towards the end. In a way, Feist does repeat the plots in his books but then again, he doesn't.I can only recommend this for die-hard fans of the game or the book. It's an average book to the average reader. You need to make the judgement for yourself though."
3,Old Friends,"While not as deep as the saga from which this is taken, it is a nice chance to visit with old friends and remember how we met them. Certain to encourage new readers and old alike to visit the entire land of Midkemia."
4,Good product,"Nice, comfortable. Fits the Nano well. One thing bothered me.After the Nano is inserted into the sleeve, it is impossible (for me) to slide the ""lock"" into or out of place, even though there is a slot cut out for access. So, you have to either leave the unit in the unlocked position or lock it, then insert it into the sleeve. But leaving it in the unlocked position hasn't caused me any problems so far.But like I mentioned, it is comfortable and the control dial is pretty easy to access, to change songs, etc. And when wearing, you ""install"" it up-side-down so when you read the dial, when on your arm, it is in the correct reading position. I like it!Jerry"
3,Does the Trick,"To sum it up in a nutshell, this product does the trick for what I paid. Sometimes I have to take the Nano out of the holder to use the controls properly and sometimes have to take it off to do certain exercises. However, these instances are not frequent enought to discontinue use."
3,Design Flaw,"I like the armband. It's very well made, but there is a design flaw. When I pull the tab over the bottom of the ipod it stretches the case tight. This puts pressure on my play/pause control and it will randomly toggle on and off. As long as I don't pull the tab to secure the ipod the controls work fine."
1,LOST HIS WAY,"Gary Moore lost himsefl in this record, one to be forgotten by his fans ( like myself ). I love him playing hard rock, I love him playing blues. But in this CD he plays none of them. It's just a confusion of sounds going nowhere, really annoying. Skip it."
1,not happy,"These are not leggings, they are merely tights with no shoe. To read the description you would think they are a real legging, they are hose."
4,Outwitting.... Not Really... But a helpful roadmap,"Outwitting the Job Market provides a solid fundamental approach to the job search. It covers most of the core elements such as resumes, networking, interviewing and negotiating. However, in today's market you need a compelling business case to convince companies to create positions for you. In your interviews you need to be able to quantify the Return on Investment (ROI) that you bring to the table so interviewers want to hire you. This is where this book falls a bit short. This book is a great resource for college graduates and entry level positions."
1,A waste of time,"With a title like that, one expects at least a couple of go-against-the-flow tips or pieces of advice. Don't look here for that, though - this book is the dullest one I've read yet on getting good jobs. Totally prosaic advice - seriously, just visit ehow and yahoo answers for this quality of advice. Want to blend right in and make sure you do nothing new? Follow this book's advice.I read the book, threw it in the garbage, and posted a picture on facebook to warn my friends away.On the other hand, Orville Pierson's book Highly Effective Networking (despite its rather dull title) is amazing! That one I can recommend wholeheartedly. I've had many jobs and sold many projects, and the way he teaches you to build new networks AND use your existing network is nothing short of fantastic."
4,Old dog,"I give it to my 11 year old labrador Lucy, I think it helps her, she seems to get around better..............Capt Stu"
3,Neutral,The product is priced very well compared to some big box retailers. Haven't taken product for too long so haven't really had a chance to get the full effects.
1,Misleading - This is a Manduka mat.,"I was excited to receive this mat, after waiting 10 days for it to be delivered. However, when I opened the box expecting a Planet Sadhana mat, it was actually a Manduka. I called customer service and he told me that it's the same Company. If you are selling a Manduka, say so, it's misleading to call it a Planet Sadhana, like it's something different to the mat every studio in the US sells. I didn't want a Manduka and would have returned it, if it weren't so heavy. I also would not have needed to pay $23.00 shipping!"
4,Great Program,This manual clearly maps out a program for trauma victims struggling with Substance Abuse. Most programs are designed for one or the other. This manual clearly describes a program that integrates approaches to both issues. There is very little fluff (stories and experiences) with only important valuable information included. It is easy to read and not written as a term paper with lots of footnotes and references.
4,Seeking Safety: A treatment Manual for PTSD and Substance Abuse.,"I am finding this manual very useful in working with clients who suffer with PTSD and Substance Abuse. The handouts are helpful and appropriate, and my client's are responding positively to this treatment approach. The activities quickly help them recognize how the two disorders are inter-related and that they need to address both issues simultaneously in order to find their road to recovery."
4,No Complaints,Book was delivered quickly in great condition. It was cheaper here than the author selling at a presentation. I would recommend to anyone in the counceling field.
1,Falls short.,"I have 35 years clinical experience in this field, and frankly found this book to be a disappointment. Would not recommend this book."
4,A useful book,I have used other workbooks for my work with PTSD and this one is very good but I have also liked others. Consider this one if you are a little burnt out on others.
3,A Historical Perspective of Hypnosis and Mediation,"The author does a credible job researching and describing the evolution of our understanding of hypnosis over time what it is and is not (and there is still uncertainty as to what it really is). He does the same for meditation although much briefer. Based on his research, he concludes that hypnosis and meditation are both process and states of awareness and that they represent unusual and different phenomena.If you are only interested in the history and evolution of hypnosis, this book is an easy and enjoyable read (includes an extensive bibliography) . However, if you are looking guidance on how to use hypnosis, hypnosis scripts, specific interventions, etc.; this is not the book for you are these are not included."
5,great book,"love Diana Palmer and her Long, Tall Texans series. Can;t wait to buy and read the next book in the series."
2,ABC Gold Investing,* Not concentrate enough in investing.* A lot of superfluous information which serve no purpose.
3,Good if you need convincing that gold is the way to go,"Relatively short on advice but long on all the reasons why gold should be part of your portfolio. Interesting facts and figures and a very quick read based on the small size of the pages and the short length of the book. If you're already in the gold camp, you can probably do better elsewere in the advice category."
4,Terrific starter book!,"Terrific starter book! Lots of nice information that's not found on any of the commercial investing sites. This book will not contribute much to my wealth, and it does not pretend to give us investing advice. It's a fun read, absolutely worth the price, and anyone holding gold (or thinking about it) should read this. I intend to read it over again. Soon."
4,Very Basic Gold Book,This would be the book to buy if you don't know anything about gold investing. It is a very beginners type book.
5,This book really helps!,"Two days a week has a great idea for people who want to lose weight: don't eat for just 2 days each week. You can drink some liquids like grapefruit juice. You can even eat walnuts and melons. It works really well because on those days, one can just disassociate from food. The choices to make are minimal. Well written and clear. An engineer wrote this book and it's an engineer's solution to a complex problem."
3,Good but not amazing.,"The writer did a good job, but it only deals with a short span of time in 1941. It would have been much better if Sarkar had written a book about Tangmere wings during the whole WW II, even if that would result in a much larger book. Anyway, the reading is easy and enjoyable, with greta appendix in the end."
3,EXPENSIVE BOOK,"It's a good book, good research, the photos are great, the appendix is good, featuring the Tangmere WIng wins and losses from April 1941 through August 9, 1941 (the day Bader was shot down). But the writing style is little bit boring. It doesn't worth it."
5,The book we've been waiting for,"At last, in 'Path of Light' we have a book that meets the need for a clear, accessible, non-daunting answer to the question: ""What is 'A Course in Miracles'?""There are plenty of other wonderful course-related books available; but, for me, this is the one that really captures the spirit, explains the seeming complexities, and does full justice to the remarkable, healing vision of the Course itself.It's a brilliant, inspiring introduction for new Course students. Which is why I'm so grateful to Robert Perry for having written it. Finally, I've got the perfect book to offer anyone, my kids included, who ever wants to take a real step towards understanding more about the path I follow."
1,Very Good Sound....Very bad components,"I opened this up and played it for one night...fantastic sound, great price, and it is 'heavy'. The finish is remarkable and detailed. The next day the LCD went out but it still worked, then quit completely. I ran down to my Walmart and they gladly exchanged it for another one. This one lasted two days. Well I liked the sound so much I tried a third time, this one lasted three days. Exchanged it again...Took the fourth unit off the shelf and took it home. LCD went out the next AM....The remote sucks, it is intermittent and the 'ipod' look alike scroll button does not do what it implies it is supposed to do. I will keep this ""brick"" and use it w/o the LCD function until the sound stops, the I will use it as an anchor for my yacht....Don't buy this. Spend a little more and get an iPod speaker from someone else other than GPX..."
1,Was great while it lasted,"I was very happy with this dock while it worked. It sounded good and I liked its features. However, after five months, the display stopped working, and without the display you can't access any of those features - hard to tune the radio, for example, if you can't tell what frequency you're tuned to. As this has only a 90 day warranty, I am also stuck with a $100 door stop."
5,Great Counting Book,My 18 month old daughter loves Dora. I bought this book in a boxed set so she could have some books with Dora. I really like this book because it uses different fruits and it's very colorful. Of course my daughter loves it since it's Dora. We've only had this book for about two weeks and I think I've read and/or listened to my husband read it about fifty times.
1,Good book,My daughter loved reading this book at bedtime. It was great for teaching her how to count to 10 in Spanish.
5,This book shows you the truth of our society!,Real Boys is an enlightning book that shows you how boys think and react. William Pollack gives you a good taste of this by explaining just how boys think and react in situations. How they differ from girls. Boys are made to be tough and told to hide their feelings and then people wonder why their are so many killings! Society needs to look at themselves and accept what has been unaccepted LET BOYS BE BOYS! Julie-
2,"Lacking in references, but good in case studies","As a psychology student at a prestigious college, I was very frustrated in reading the book because of the lack of evidence/proof/or reference that Pollack provides. In addition, there is a large amount of repitition in the book. It reads like a parenting manual, but is seemingly aimed at literate, educated people-- potentially leaving an entire population of parents out of the picture. They may get caught up in the terminology, or frustrated with unending opinions and repetition. Despite this all, it confronts valid issues surrounding the problems faced by boys (i.e shaming, self-esteem), and provides interesting anecdotes to support the author's own opinion."
4,Great Book,This book was required reading for a child pychology class I took. I think this should be requrired reading for everybody who has a male in his or ger life. It offers some explanation about why males are so violent. It does not make excuses but give a better understanding of males and the struggles they go through. Reading this book may help understand themlseles better.
3,You don't have to read the whole thing,"The author makes some fantastic points in the first hundred or so pages in this book. He then makes those points over and over again until they have lost all meaning.I just feel that the momentum of the narration in a book like this needs to be backed up by more then example after example that says the same thing.Overall-If I had to read the term ""gender straightjacket"" or ""boy code"" one more time I would have shot myself in the head."
1,Too much cheese without any crackers,"This 398 page book of cheese could have been easily written in about ten pages. Pollack does introduce some interesting ideas about gender-straight jacketing and the harms of the boy code. Unfortunately, he does a horrible job of making his claims believable. First, he generalizes with phrases like, ""research shows"". He does list his sources in the back, but there are fifteen pages of sources without any indication as to which figures go with which sources. Secondly, the stories in his book seem too cheesy to take place in real life. If you are going to write a book about real boys, one should find some real boys to base your book on, because these stories don't happen to most of us real boys out there. Overall, I would recommend that you read the epilogue, as it is a great summary and presents the only real points of this dissappointing book."
4,Interesting insight and ideas.,"As the mother of both boys and girls I knew from the start that they were wired differently. It's helpful to review the ideas in this book to gain insight on the male perspective. However, like its counterpart `Reviving Ophelia' I think this book focuses too much on the negative and not enough on the positive and the solutions. If you want solutions to everyday parenting problems check out Perfect Parenting - The Dictionary of 1000 Parent Tips by Elizabeth Pantley"
5,A book we cannot afford to live without!,"This book is a must for everyone who is raising or working with boys in our culture. We can finally rid ourselves of archaic thoughts on how boys ""should"" act and be treated. School violence, including suicides, ends with everyone picking up this book and putting the ideas in it into action. It is a nice read and highly thought provoking."
4,valuable and interesting,"This book contains many valuable insights. A must-read for parents. For people who are interested in another thought-provoking work on the subject of raising boys and what the pressures of gender stereotyping can do, I recommend Our Guys by Bernard Lefkowitz, based on a true story. It explores many fascinating issues about boys and girls, and it reads like a thriller -- I couldn't put it down, and neither could anyone else in my reading group. A good companion to Real Boys."
4,Good arguments for an interesting analysis,"Mr. Pollack presents a good case on the damage we as a society do to boys in raising them according to the ""Boy Code"" that we ourselves were raised with. Refreshingly, he also suggests ways to break through or subvert that damage in order to get our boys to trust and express their emotions. While he seems to want to blame a large variety of socialization and personality difficulties that boys and men face on this suppressed-emotion concept, he still points out that boys are indeed emotional humans that need some sort of expression to be mentally healthy."
4,Very Good,"Finally a man who will come out and say what needs to be said. We treat our boys as if being kind to them will make them weak. It is through gentle guildance and unconditional love that strength is built in both boys and girls. It's time for our society to give up the myth that hitting children, yelling at them, and treating them as if they are animals to be trained will somehow turn them into caring adults."
1,Disappointing,"As a counselor for emotionally disturbed teenagers I was really exited to read this book. Unfortunately, Pollock tends to point out the obvious. Yes, it is okay for boys to cry, be sure and not to call your son a ""sissy"", etc... This book could have been written in a five pages. Very monotonous reading."
2,Too Long,"As a teacher, I read a lot of books about education and childhood development. Real Boys is typical of most of these books in that the author takes 500-600 pages to say what he could have expressed in 100 pages. Read the first chapter and you get the point of the whole book."
2,Coddling is not the answer,"This was a book I was assigned to read for a graduate level diversity class. In a group consistng of myself and three women, our opinions on specific topics in the book varied. However, we all felt that the author was telling us that we need to coddle our boys.In ""Teachers as Cultural Workers""(1998), Paulo Freire discusses the differences between authoritative, authoritarian, and passive teaching, with the passive approach caused by parents and teachers ""coddling"" the child. Boys do need to be expressive, but not to the extent that Pollack would have.The other issue I have with the book is his noted studies. Not only is the reader left not knowing which study belongs to which statement, but also some of the studies are extremely outdated. For example, Pollack notes results of a study linking gay boys to being hereditary through a report from 1953! ..."
4,It's good,"This book is a good book to add to your library if you have a boy. There are some great stories in it, which can provide insight into your boys head."
1,Disappointing book,"I purchased this book because I loved Reviving Ophelia. This book is an absolute waste of money. First of all, it is difficult to read. Second, I don't agree with the conclusions of the authors. Third, it is boring. I read Reviving Ophelia in less than a week. Real Boys has been on my nightstand for three months, still only 1/4 finished. Meanwhile, I have finished at least 10 other books."
2,Blaming the cultural elite?,"I felt this book, unlike its subject, was neither controversial nor interesting enough to merit much discussion. I agree with the other reader from Seattle that Pollack contradicts himself on a number of counts. But I do have to wonder about this man-hating cultural elite described by the Washington reader. There's no question that there's been a recent gynocentric trend in literature, academia, etc. But who is driving this trend? The cultural elite is largely made up of men- male writers, professors, entrepreneurs. Is this trend not only man-hating, but self-hating as well? It seems simplistic and just plain silly to blame the struggles of today's young men on an evil cultural elite and the degeneration of paternal presence in the home. The members of this supposed cultural elite grew up in a time when papas were far more likely to stay married to mamas. But just look how they turned out."
2,find another book,"Makes many accurate observations about boy behavior and its origins,however,the book leans a little too much toward ""feminization"" of boys in preventing behavioral problems.This may be the politically-correct way to help boys,but not the productive way or the ethical way."
1,Thank God someone seperated me from this book!!,"Good lord what a bunch of whinning drivel. Wipe your eyes and get a grip, and for God's sake be a man. Who can get through this stuff?"
4,Excellent source for emotionally dry men & parents of boys,"This book is an excellent source for parents of boys, as well as, for men who desire to know why we act they way we do. The author has definitely helped me understand the relationships I now have with my mother and father. I will utilize his many suggestions to develop my relationship with my sons and help them to become secure with their own emotions. Also, the author does a fairly good job at narration.I will refer to these tapes often as my boys grow."
4,I should have bought the abridged version. Verbose!,Good stuff but Pollack tends to repeat himself. I would have appreciated the same information in half the text.
4,Steps beyond parenting: handbook for mentors of boys,"This book is not simply a guide to the better parenting of boys. Anyone who deals with boys should have a look at this eye-opening book. Though some of Pollack's outlooks may seem extreme (ie: homosexuality in boys) he hits all the boys emotions and feelings right on the target. Especially informative are the tips on how to connect with boys. These tips are ideal for mentors, special friends, and teachers of boys. Highly recommended."
5,Brilliant and Surprising,"Rediker is, first of all, a wonderful writer - even if you've never read a about the early 1700s before, you'll be engrossed in what he has to say about the world of ""Jack Tar"". People who enjoy sea-faring fiction will also get a kick out of it; Rediker reveals a world of constant backbreaking work in a very dangerous environment, brutal punishments for the tiniest infraction, and of the strange brotherhood that forms among sailors. For me the biggest surprise was that the pirates are the good guys in the story - men who broke away from the tyrannical hierachy of ships, who formed a very specific set of moral rules based upon the traditions of the English poor, who shared the booty, who championed the weak and punished the strong. Kind of a Robin Hood thing, very interesting. Entertaining, compelling, informative."
1,Marxist claptrap,Rediker's Pirates of the Caribbean as a prototypical labor union is a caricature almost as ridiculous as Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean.
3,Between two stools,"Concentrates on the cultural effects of the Arab invasions and the extent to which Persian culture became a vector for the eastward spread of Islam in the 8th/9th centuries. A rather frustrating book, too detailed for beginners yet not specific enough on any detail to give a real insight to any of the individual historical events of which the theme is a composite. This is a shame as reading between the lines it seems apparent that the author was constrained by editorial pressure rather than lack of fact or interest.Still as an overview of the achievements of the early Islamic era it is an original piece of scholarship."
4,Fine silicone set,"If you haven't tried silicone for baking, this is a good starter set. Silicone provides super-easy clean up, is light and easy to work with, and cools quickly. These pieces are well-made -- not flimsy as I've found with some silicone bakeware.The color is a deep, rich red, which makes baked goods look even better out of the oven.The loaf pans are large and deep; muffin pans are standard size. And who couldn't use spatulas? It's a welcome addition to my collection."
4,Seascape Kenneth John,"Get out your paint and palette knives...five colors plus white, two knives, one brush and paint along. This is slow and rather detailed so you can finish your own painting while you watch. I'm personally not fond of the ""colors"" but the video is great in terms of the use of values and a paint knife for a seascape. I would recommend it, have fun."
5,They work well on my Power Amp.,"I am using a Crown Power Amp, and with the Neutrik Speakonadaptors, all of my speaker cords now are compatible."
2,"Neutrik to 1/4"" adapter","I think the whole Neutrik connector thing is a bad idea. The 1/4"" phone jack has been the industry standard for years and has always worked fine, now if I buy new equipment I have to either buy new cables (Neutrik) or these adapters to accomplish the same result. The adapters I purchased worked fine, but I shouldn't have had to buy them in the first place."
4,Good complimentary source,"This book accurately traces the development and origin of the American Bungalow. Lancaster's essay is informative and thorough. This is a good source book for those wishing to discover and know the evolution of this building type. This is not a 'style book' or a good book for decorating ideas, as the photos are not very clear and there are limited interior shots"
2,Color !!!!! Wheres the COLOr !!!!,"60 pages, 8 pages of color. I thought the world is in color. Does cover some very basic ideas for race car graphics, but this is diluted with black and white photos. Published in 1987"
5,Magical Performance!,"I was fortunate to see these two great singers in this opera at the Met about the time of this performance. I was apprehensive about Bergonzi in this role as I was used to seeing him as Rhadames,Ricardo in Ballo, Chenier, and other spinto roles he excelled in. At this performance I was amazed at his ability to sing so gloriously in such a bel canto lyric role. His Una Furtiva Lagrima, though gloriously sung, was almost anti climatic due to so much beautiful singing which had come before this great aria. Along with his glorious singing, he acted the role to perfection. I had seen Scotto in Lucia so was not surprised that she would excell in this role. This dvd is, for me, a wonderful remberance of one of my most memorable nights at the Met!"
5,Works great so you won't slip,"These fit well and do help so you do not fall on ice/snow. Fits over shoes. My husband has fallen many times during winter months, but not since he has these. Traction is very good."
1,"Not very good, unless flat packed snow","I bought these thinking they might be easier to put on than Yaktracs, which they were, but they also come off easier on the trail. Wore these once, they are not great on ice, you can slide. The 2nd time it had been warm the trails got muddy in spot and still icy and then it snowed 5 inches. After walking my dog on over a mile or so trail, I noticed one of the spikeys was gone. I went back the next day with my Yaks, and there it was hanging from a branch, as someone had found it. I think i'll stay with my yaks.Maybe if it had 8 spikes, it would have better traction."
1,dont do it!,"product did fit correctly to say the least. if i had worn these, they would have done more harm than good. vendor's response to this was too bad you own them now. amazon came to my rescue and returned my money after they saw the response i received from the vendor. if i could give this product ""0"" stars i would. i repeat DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!"
1,False Advertising,"The shirt displayed on the web page is not the one that gets shipped. I'm not sure if the wrong photo is on the web, there was mix-up in shipping, or if it's just plain false advertising. As always, buyer beware."
4,Still great blues,Jim Suhler is still playing great blues/rock.The only bad thing is the horns - I just don't like them in the music!
1,Buyer Beware,"The pictue quality is good when the product is new. But--as people have reported elsewhere on the web--after a few years, a key capacitor fails, and snowstorms of horizontal lines persist for 15 to 30 minutes after startup. I found the company's tech support and customer service to be very unsatisfactory. When you compare the price of the VG175 to the life of the product, it's a poor investment, unless you know how to replace a defective capacitor."
5,One Big Doodle,"Track Listing:1. Traces2. Summer Lover3. Autumn Breeze4. We Are Gods Tonight5. Alien6. A Place Without A Name7. Dice8. I'm Glad You RememberedAll Songs Produced By LovellExcept ""I'm Glad You Remembered"" Produced By Phil Olson"
2,Wanted To Like It,"I really wanted to like this book. His cast of characters sounds interesting, a marginal repo man, Yakuza, a NSA super-SWAT women (yes NSA, the author doesn't know any better) and various others. But to my mind the characters just didn't come together to build an engrossing tale. I was able to put the book down for days at a time come back to it and read a few of the very short chapters, then put it down again. It took me over a month to read and that's unusual. I can't point to any one thing and it's not a horrible read it just never drew me in. I will say it was a lot better than the author's Gun Monkeys which I really disliked. I didn't dislike this one, I just didn't care."
2,Too Graphic for pre teens,"I bought this book for my 13 year old son as his body began to change. I needed issues such as pimples, hygiene, andchanging emotions addressed in a nonthreatening kid-like manner. This book is more for the parent to read and retellto the adolescent. There is a lot of information that I feel is better left for much older teenagers."
4,very helpful in bridgeing the gap,"The examples and clear language in this book really made it clear to me that sometimes, it's the parent who needs some attitude adjusting too."
5,Okay.,This track is okay. But I recommend The Ride of the Valkyrie from the cd Wagner Without Words.
5,Me transportas!,"Gracias JL por tu imaginación. Te escucho a diario y me transportas por ""La Travesía"" y continuo viendo a una ""mariposa bailando con un granito de sal"". Soy una dominicana orgullosa de tener un poeta (además de músico) de un talento extraordinario. Los arreglos músicales y la variedad hacen este cd muy ameno. La belleza de tu románticismo me toca el corazón. Tu inspiración es parte de Dios y tambíén a Él le doy las gracias. Nunca te alejes de la música!"
5,"Excelente album. Tres o cuatro futuros clasicos, y cuidado","este ultimo cd del gran Juan Luis Guerra esta formidable. Gran variedad de ritmos, y bellas letras. Me encantan entre otros los temas Si no bailas conmigo, Something Good y A la vera. Las salsas y los merengues estan todos sabrosisimos. No hay una cancion que no este buena. Grammy para album tropical latino!!!"
3,la llave de mi corazon,"I like the music of Luis Guerra, but was somewhat disappointed by this new release. I liked his original ""ojala que llueva cafe"" better."
2,Boring Album... It lacks good lyrics.,"Didn't like this album. Totally hated ""La Llave De Mi Corazon"" it sounded like the song you would hear on a Burger King commercial. Why add the english lyrics? There is no need for it. I'm totally disappointed and deleting from my iPod. Get all of his previous material, because it's really world class."
5,Ideal for inline hockey practice,"Easy to slip on and off, players can change 'sides' in seconds, reasonably robust finish. Buy adult size for players over 12 years old."
4,Good enough to do the job,"Nothing spectacular about these pinnies, but they are good enough to do the job. They have held up well through use and laundering. Only real downside is that some of them have an inordinate amount of loose hanging strings that need to be cut off. Seems like they could be less expensive too, but with inflation I find myself saying that about a lot of products these days."
2,Not large enough for adults,Tried one on but did not fit well. The elastic at the bottom caused them to ride up high every time I reached or made any movement. Did not seem like an adult size even though it said it was.
3,Scrimmage Vest,"I bought 3 colors - scarlet, blue and black. The blue was an inferior material to what the red was made of."
3,A Different Kind of Benefit CD,"It's sad that a continent of 700 million is better known for war, corrupt governments and the rapid spread of the AIDS virus more than its creative musicians. ""So Why"" features Youssou N'Dour, Papa Wemba and four other popular musicians in a benefit CD for the International Committee for the Red Cross. Simply put, this CD is a bit better than some of the other benefit recordings we have seen over the last decade. While that's not saying much, if it introduces you to a continent of incredibly diverse music, then it's worth the money."
3,Musically accomplished but only for Khan devotees,"As always Gromer Khan's musicianship shines through. It is in the style of Space Hotel (see the publishers website for more background info on GK) even down to the packaging.For newcomers I'd definitely recommend buying Space Hotel over this one as in comparison Sufi is more one-dimensional in feel and has a downbeat, brooding tone that makes it a far less uplifting listen.Mike B"
1,nothing like the real polo,not at all like the former REAL polo sprays i've bought. no box; no problem. smelled like cheap/shelf-life expired aftershave poured into a dirty ash tray; big problem. this is first negative review i felt compelled to write. a sad waste of my money.
3,polo,Ordered as a gift.....not surprised by size because it is only 1 oz..but looked everywhere before ordering to make sure I was getting a new item in box. Even the pic shows a box. Unless hidden very well.....I couldn't find anything to state this would come without one. The item came unboxed and invoice stated unboxed. Don't know for sure what is in the bottle......lol

5,Basic Info,This is a concise guide for beginning investors. It is easy to understand and reasonably complete. The material is too elementary for someone experienced in mutual fund investing but just about right for someone who is about to get their feet wet.
2,A disapointing book - Decepcionante.,"I must confess that this has been one of the borest books I have ever read. Padded out with plenty of trivial ideas and lacking with something new. On the good side, it's an overview over most of the topics in competitor analysis but really heavy going to go through."
4,Real life,"This book is very informative and technical! The pilot, Col. Kenneth R Martin is also my grandfather! He would never talk to me personnally about the war but when I read the book he was glad to answer my questions. The book is quite informative and intellegent. What the men went through makes me thankful they came home and thankful that our generation has no clue!My Grandfather is now in the heavens again flying with his buddies!"
4,A Fortune Teller Told Me,"Like one of the other people who wrote in, I too have not yet read Goodnight, Mister Lenin. I have just finished reading A Fortune Teller Told Me and it's been the first book in a long time where I wanted to read every single word rather than just scan through. Tiziano writes as if he is speaking, and this, together with his travels and constant search for answers which lead him on a colourful and fascinating journey, left me looking for more of his books. Mr Terzani you're a gem, thank you for sharing."
5,Extraordinary,"Just wanted to chime in my two cents on ""Fortune-Teller""--I've lived and travelled in Asia for the last 3 years, and Terzani's book is the only travel writing I've read that opened my eyes to ways of thinking outside the norm, the mundane, the Lonely Planet view of the world. Extremely worth seeking out.Naturally, this leads me to wanting to read ""Goodnight Mister Lenin"", if it can be found. Anyone with a dogeared copy laying around, please let me know!"
1,You are on your own with this one.,"If it works for you, it's great. But if you have any problems you will never hear a word from FarStone support. I find this very irresponsible and I would recommend everyone to run away from Farstone products. Their web page crashes when you submit a bug report and they never return support emails. I've sent several now. My copy used to work, now it's dead and useless to me. Too bad FarStone isn't putting more budget into their support. They could have had a great product."
4,No Problem Here!,"I installed Virtual Drive 7 about two weeks ago. Since then I've created ""virtual disks"" for the following games: Will Rock, Microsoft Train Simulator, Diablo II, Adventure Pinball, Unreal Tournament 2003, and Call of Duty. Everything works fine. I don't need to switch CDs anymore, and I can even see a performance boost in some of these games. I have no idea why people might be having trouble with this software because it works fine for me. I'd give it a 5 star rating, but I decided to take a star away just in case other people might have trouble with it. I recommend Virtual Drive 7 to anybody who hates hunting down CDs. Just make sure to check the return policy."
1,Virtual Drive 7.0,"Although Farstone claim that this software will run most games as virtual CD's (VCD's), I've found that it doesn't work as advertised. With several of my latest games,E.G. Enter the Matrix, IGI2 etc. either they will not run from VCD's, or they cannot be ""built"" as VCD's.All attempts to get an answer from Farstone's tech support have gone unanwered. And attempts to E-mail Farstone get ""bounced"" by their server!"
2,Suprise ending,"Perhaps I don't read the fine print often enough, but I was surprised one day recently that what I purchased was essentially a subscription for a year to this service. I rebuilt my OS, installed the application, and found that updates were not available because I had purchased it over a year ago. This rendered most of my virtual CD's useless. As reported in other reviews, my experience is that farstone ignores requests for assistance. Bottom line: good product (worked well for a year), bad customer support, sneaky pricing structure."
1,Nobody home,I intended to buy this but searching around the net found other products that seem to be able to handle DVD much better than this. On their updated web site Farstone show a 7.1 version that may be better than this 7.0 but if you had bought this 7.0 version they would want additional money to upgrade. I sent messages to all their listed email addresses on their web site asking for further information but all the messages were bounced back as undeliverable. This did not seem to augur well for future support for the product. I wound up canceling my order.
1,Problem with playing games from Virtual Image.,"I bought this program from Amazon and I can't play my games while mounting a ""Fake"" cd into the virtual drive. I have this problem with my CD and I don't have the money to buy a new one. Anyway I barrowed a CD-om from my friend and created a Image using this program. Just like it says: Play any game from CD-ROM at hard drive speed. And it did't work it say insert your original cd and not a backup cd. What do I do wrong I don't get it. Please help me with this problem. I feel tricked about this program it does not fullfill what it said it would. Please E-mail me if you know where the problem is. I have tried ""Intelligt copy"" and ""ordinary copy"" and it still don't work."
5,"Love it, amazing product",I bought it at CompUSA by impulse. I am using it everyday. My favorite product.
5,extremely satisfied,"excellent compilation of songs. if you like old school chi-town steppintake it from an O.G. Chi-Town stepper,(game recognizes game)it's on the 1. Remember we dont blow here,we grow here."
3,Jenna,"First, Jenna is a porn star. The video is a tour to her studio. So, it is actually a behind-the-scene promotion thing.Nothing in depth is said or shown. Entertainment level is average."
1,Left me Brain Dead...,"I just didn't get this book. Never really seemed to go anywhere. Was there even an antagonist in this story? I can't remember much of what I read because it could never hold my interest. And then it just ended. No real climax. It was more dialogue than action/adventure. At one point, some animals started talking and then I really knew I was lost.Just not my taste, I guess. I think I was expecting more of a John Carter of Mars type of story. I'm not sure what kind I got."
1,WARNING: Only plays on computers,"This DVD description is very misleading. The DVD doesn't play on a regular DVD player, only on a computer. I'm returning it now."
4,Just ordered,Well I just ordered it and it was the last one which is funny so I guess they will be getting more later.I hope it is nice because it was very cheap and its stainless steal so overall im excited
1,FPO/AP,kinda mad b/c I'm in the military stationed oversea's and they won't ship to my FPO/AP adress wich really for mailing costs and what not count as being in the united states
1,can't wait for the updated edition!,"Now that so many more ingredients are kosher for a dittohead cocktail, I can't wait to see what new concoctions BC comes up with! Just remember: too many cocktails may affect your hearing!"
5,Entrepreneurism At Its Best,"What a great idea for a book series. I saw this in the ""Limbaugh Library"" under Rush's recommended reading list for all members of the Limbaugh Institute For Advanced Conservative Studies, and I had to try it out! If you love the show (i.e. are a dittohead), then you will find this to be one of the most entertaining books you've ever gotten your hands on. With adult beverages like ""Affluenza Aphrodisiac"" and ""Puff The Magic Daschle"", you won't be able to get enough!!! From beginning to end, this book cleary illustrates the ingenuity and good humor of Rush's audience. As I read about it in NewsMax magazine, ""created for dittoheads by a dittohead, and not by an 'art & croissants crowd-type' publishing executive"", you can't not love this book if you love EIB..."
1,Same thing as before...,"This is just a repackaged version of the 2001 Math Advantage. It seems like all they did was slap 2005 on it and add a link to some math websites in the main menu. Encore did have some good software in the past and now all they do is repackage them every year. If you insist on buying any Encore software, I suggest finding the 2001 version of it on discount or get a used version."
1,Deceiving,I am thoroughly disappointed in this item. I was searching for a dragon ring that had an open mouth and I thought that I had found it.BUT the picture is not accurate because when I received it was solid. It's pretty shoddy quality for detail either way.I don't think that it was worth the deception.
3,Pretty good RPG,"I bought this to complete my collection of Might and Magic Games as it was the last one I needed. While it is not nearly as good in my opinion as some of the others, it was still a good game to play."
1,Worst installment of the series!,"Radical departure from the format of the series, which was a terrible idea! Game play is crap, graphics are crap, and the program itself is annoyingly buggy! Don't waste your money on this!"
4,Best among few alternatives,"(Warning: a review for a vanity product follows, the evident success of which probably signals the end of civilization as we know it).Good for touch-up - best brand I've tried, though frankly there are few competitors in this space. (Why is that?) JFM's gel is a better formulation in some respects then this brand's non-gel dye -- easier to apply and holds up better over time and with temperature variations. Rarely goes on sale, but GTM does have an token email coupon campaign."
2,Company sent wrong product (twice),"The first time I ordered this Item several months ago, they sent me the #40 Shampoo-in Haircolor. I'm bald so that doesn't help me much. :) Errors happen and they send me the correct item free of charge.However, when I ordered this time, they sent me the wrong one again.... :("
5,YAY!,"My order for this lens was supposed to arrive on the 5th of March, but came yesterday, the 2nd. It's arrival was a surprise and so was the package. Comes with everything you need, including a nice big lens cap to fit over the fisheye. I haven't really messed with the macro much, but the lens feels sturdy and reliable. I hope to be using it for a long time :))"
3,fish eye lens,"wish there were some instructions. seems to work, it arrived in different mailings from all other parts but ok good day"
4,i liked it,if you dont have money to buy original fish eye-wide angle-lens then this is a great choice.i do recommend it for new photographer not pro ones
1,The put wrong info in the description,"I quote the description saying ""67MM Front Lens"" which is completely NOT TRUE. This thing doesn't fit my 60D. Oh well, it was a cheap attempt anyways."
1,This lens has ruined my Christmas.,This lens was suppose to fit a Canon Rebel. It does not! When I took it to a camera store they said there aren't any adapters even made for it to fit a Rebel. This was to be my 16 year old daughter's big Christmas present. I am so disappointed in Amazon. This is the second time Amazon has let me down.
1,Is NOT for use with Canon Cameras,Absolutely does NOT work on any form of Canon DSLR camera. I have 2 different Canons and this isn't even close to fitting it. Not to mention the fact that it's not so much a lens as a poorly made filter. AVOID!
3,adapter,everything is good i like it but the only thing is that the adapter didnt have the lens on it
1,Buyer beware of this one..,"This lens is total garbage. The resolution is terrible, even on a video camera. It doesn't appear to be coated at all & the laughable ""lens hood"" rattles. Not worth the shipping cost. Even if it's free shipping."
3,Cheap Lens that gets the job done,"At first, I was skeptical about buying this lens as many of the reviews were not the most positive. But I decided that $50 bucks for a lens wasn't bad and went ahead and purchased it. The lens arrived with only one adapter (I was expecting two) but it did fit my rebel xt. In other reviews some mentioned receiving a lens cleaning kit.I didn't and was just a little bummed by this. The lens itself arrived in a gold color, directly clashing with my all black rebel.However, I realized it gets the job done (no matter what color) and I don't regret the purchase. It's a cheap lens that seems durable and gives me a nice effect. I only wish i had gotten the black lens as pictured! and i mean the lens cleaning kit wouldn't have hurt..."
2,Save your money,"I'm not sure why I bought a fish eye lens, but I thought I would use it for the macro function. Mistake: the pictures are so fuzzy I would not waste the ink and paper to print them. I tried to sharpen them but that just made them noisier. The edges are so blurry that one would hope a viewer would think you meant to do that. Anyway, the macro function could (and was) better replaced by my 18-55 lens. I have put it back in the box to store it high out of sight. I guess this just proves you get what you pay for."
4,great deal for the price,it may not be the best fish eye lens out there but for 21$ its worth it. you could be paying 250$ or more for something else to do the same job this lens does.
1,Didn't work,My camera was listed as one of the camera that the lens would work for and that turned out to be a BIG LIE. Had to send it back (which was very easy). Not worth the time.
1,DOES NOT FIT A CANON XTI!!!,"This may be a good lens, however I wouldnt know since it does not fit a canon kit lens or 50mm lens as stated IN THE TITLE!! It is very misleading that it specifically says it will fits canons. Buyers BEWARE. Amazon would not let me return this gift since it was purchased from a seller. Very unhappy. It wasnt even the one pictured, as the lens I recieved was a brassy color, not black like the pic. I cant belive that a seller would mislead customers like that."
5,Great Job,"This product is a Polaroid lens, it arrived very quickly. Customer support resolved my issue very quickly. I would recommend this product if asked."
2,not sure it's worth it,"The macro lens attached just fine, have yet to figure out how to attach that fish eye. Thanks for absolutely no instructions. I'm still scouring the internet looking for info. Might yet return it and buy a good macro only."
5,Fish-Eye lens,"Have only used a few times, but love it. It is easy to add to camera and have enjoyed the difference in perspective through this lens. Good delivery time and great product."
2,Not a Lens for Canon T2i,This does not fit a Canon Rebel T2i. I should have read all of the reviews before adding purchasing this. I did do some research after receiving it and found that it can be used as a filter on a canon lens. It has not produce photos with a fish eye effect but I'll continue to experiment with it.
1,Not suitable for an amateur,"This lens is very poor quality, and takes poor quality photos. You don't get a wider angle, you only get the fisheye effect...which I can just as easily do in a basic photo editing program."
5,Great lens,"I have just opened this item. At first glance I can say that the wide angle part of the item fits right onto my 58mm lens, the glass is clear and clean, and the build seems very solid. I'm having trouble getting enough light inside to focus with it, but I'll try again tomorrow in the daylight.In other news, I had a question about the macro feature of this lens and contacted the seller, who was very helpful and assisted me with the proper use of the lens. I would recommend people get this."
1,Embarrassingly poor description,"The lens itself might be worth something, but I am unable to test, because of the RIDICULOUS DESCRIPTION.Here are some facts a prospective buyer might want to know:1. This is a Polaroid lens. It comes in a Polaroid box, includes a nice Polaroid padded pouch, and has POLAROID stamped all over the lens.2. Satisfactory build quality, especially for a $20 item.3. The lens itself fits 58mm threads. It comes with a stepdown adapter to 52mm.But I CAN'T USE IT, because it DOESN'T FIT MY CAMERA. Are you listening Amazon? Even though it was in the search results for ""46mm wide angle lens"", it doesn't fit (obviously). And nowhere in the description does it say what size threads it DOES fit."
4,Still learning.,"I purchased this lens on a whim. It was not very expensive and I was not expecting much in return, but have been pleasantly surprised. I am still learning how to effectively use the lens and that has been a lot of fun. Really happy that I decided to spend the money to play!"
5,what a fun lens,"This is a great little lens. I don't mind the black around the edge at all, I think its really neat. And if you zoom out you still get a bit of the effect without the black. It's good to have some creative freedom and see what kind of images you can get with this lens. Definitely a fun lens, and totally worth it."
1,fisheye lens,I would give this product -5 stars if I could.. It is actually kinda junky. It does not stay on the lens and is nearly impossible to get the fish eye effect from it. All in all very dissatisfied.I purchased this from Amazon and in no way do I hold Amazon responsible. They were as always courteous and fast. I had this product long before the due date for mailing.
2,CHEEP,First of all what I received is not what is depicted nor the quality it claims. product seams to only work with a specific lens ( not sure which one) 58mm attachment threading will ruin threading on lens. (posb fact. defect) buy a real fish eye you will be much more happier with your photo's
3,you get what you pay for,"it's a fun toy, but don't expect it'll give you amazing images. But for $40, it's a pretty fun toy to have!"
3,Thought this was a full fisg eye lens...,"Didn't realize I was buying a 'semi' fish eye.. as nothing in the description said so. :( was disappointed about that. Had i known..i would have look elsewhere.But the lens is okay.. no real instructions or any information on how to use.. unclear as to what the 'hood' or whatever that thing is..does.The lens cap/cover just fits over it.. nothing too secure, so it keeps popping off."
1,SKIP!,"This lens got stuck to my camera for 2 years! I wish I could say that I loved it, but it was overall terrible."
3,it's okay,i use a different lens more than this one. this is sort of my back up lens. it has a weird loose part that i don't really understand :(
2,did not work,I picked out two wide angle lenses for my wife's birthday for her Canon Eos 1000D XL SLR camera! The Digital 0.45X Professional Wide Angle Lens 58 MM with Macro High Definition and the 0.42X FISHEYE LENS W/ MACRO FOR CANON EOS DIGITAL REBEL [Camera]? Both came up as lenses for her camera but neither actually fit onto the Canon's connector?
3,"Does the job, but....","This takes fisheye and wide angle pictures but not professional quality. It's fun to play with, but the images are slightly blurry."
4,Good for the cash,"for the price and the product, love it. just getting into taking better pictures, and i really enjoy using the fisheye."
4,.42x Fisheye Lens for Canon EOS,Great lense for the price. It has some weight to it and feels like quality. It does what it's suppose to and is great for stitching photos. You can get more for more money but this one is not a bad purchase.
2,Fisheye lens,"The shipping was really fast but when i got the package it wasnt even a lens. I dont even know what this is suppose to be. They contacted me about an adapter so I was thinking I was going to enjoy my new lens, but to my surprise I cant even do that. This is upsetting that I didnt get what I paid for."
2,Doesnt Work,Doesnt fit at all. I have a canon Eos Rebel T2i. It looks like it would be a good product but i cant make it fit. Going to try it on my Canon T1
3,Funphotos,Bought this lens as a gift for grandson. He enjoys taking action pictures of Bmx riders. Loves the effects this lens creates. Only problem was the initial installation was a little difficult but once figured out works great!
3,Hmmm.,"It's a little flimsy, and doesn't really fit on the rebel all that well. With a larger lens it doesn't really have much fish eye at all. Since it's not the right size for my lens and has to go on an adapter ring, there's a little vignetting around the edges.A friend of mine has a video camera that it fits on without the adapter ring and it looks cool for that.Overall, it does work... sort of... but I wish I had spent a little extra cash and bought something a little better."
2,"It was a good book, but...","I thought this was a relatively good book, and I enjoyed reading the case studies and thought the techniques given were rock solid.All this solid, well-researched information was marred by overly radical feminist viewpoints. I found it absolutely PRETENTIOUS on the author's part when she felt the need to change the pronouns to ""she"" when quoting Dr. Raymond Moody.Otherwise, it was okay book."
5,Intriguing Love Story,"This book was exciting, romantic, and erotic. The heroine is smart and sassy, and need protection of her mind, body and soul. The hero is strong, supportive, and sexy. Even though I did not resemble the characters, I felt the emotions and feelings portrayed. The main two characters were not afraid to follow their hearts. There is some angst in accepting love, but it's dealt with quickly and is decided by their hearts. As the story unfolds, you don't know all of the bad guys until the end. Also, both characters have strong support systems (values and family). Not your traditional love story-boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl in the end. But an exceptional love story, where people are allowed to be afraid, hurt, and even damaged from past love, and find their way out of the rabbit hole."
3,Dark-skinned women?,"While I thoroughly enjoyed this book and thought it was well-written, what I did not like was how the main character (Jillian) was depicted. Almost every interracial romance book that I've read depicts the heroine as nearly white. Jillian is described as having a honey-roasted complexion with a mop of long auburn-colored/sandy-brown hair (p. 28/p. 14) that flows down her back and across her shoulders (p. 14). Jillian sounds like a white woman with a good tan, rather than a African-American woman. Why is it that the authors of these books can't have a main character that looks like Alek Wek, or at least like the girl that is displayed on the cover of the book??"
4,A True Gem,"Harrison was one sexy cop, just the way I like my men, sexy and brooding. He and Jillian had great chemistry and the story flowed well.I guess after watching all these mystery movies I kind of become an expert, I figured out how the head bad guy was from the very beginning. I was just so in love with Harrison, what a hero."
2,Predictable and Cliche,"This novel was a total disappoint me. I agree with Rachel. The story was predictable, had quite a few typos, and there was very little to keep the reader engaged. Between the two main characters, I felt that the things happening between them were improbable. I disliked this novel and would NOT reccomend it. If you want to read a good I/R novel, read The Meeting of the Waters, Taming It Down, or Lady Moses... all by Kim McLarin. Carmichael let ehr readers down with this novel."
5,Great retro phone,"We remodeled our kitchen last summer and wanted to replace our old beige wallphone with something jazzier. This is a great looking phone and although we bought it for looks, it works great. It has a nice heavy feel, not cheap or flimsy. Read the instructions carefully if you're mounting it on the wall. The receiver won't stay on the base if you do it wrong (yes, I learned that the hard way). It's a simple phone that works and looks great."
5,Nostalgia revisited,"Fantastic. I love this stuff. Why? Because you can't take life seriously when you are listening to The Monkees box set. The newer stuff on here I don't like, you can keep it. I don't think these guys realized it at the time, that they had industry powerhouses cranking out some great music... yeah, there are some clunkers, but who cares.. still worth getting."
1,Defective Production Run,"I bought three of these sets. All three were missing the fourth CD. That seems to be a fairly significant production oversight. Don't they have QC people at Rhino?I'll wait a few years for the defective sets to clear out, then I'll buy it again, as the first three CDs were great."
2,No Way,"I found the quality of the first 2 cd's in this collection to be extremely poor. The songs have a ""tinny"" sound and at times the snare drum and tambourine seem to overpower the vocals. I don't think it's a limitation of the source tape as I've had other Monkees cd's that sound better. The 3rd cd is a little better, but I would not purchase this set due to the poor production quality."
3,"Where's ""Laugh""?","Incredible compilation. But minus one of my fave songs! Why was ""Laugh"" (side 2, track 5 of the original vinyl More of the Monkees lp -- the tune that preceded I'm a Believer) excluded?"
2,How disappointing!,"I was all psyched to buy this set when I heard about it on the radio. I quailed a bit at the price because $15 per CD seems a bit steep, but ""Hey,"" I said, ""there's an awful lot of music on here."" All the Monkees music together in one place, they said. But is it true?I viewed the track list and my absolute favorite Monkees song of all time is nowhere to be found. Sure, some great ones like Auntie Griselda and others you don't hear much, even on oldies stations, were there, but not Zilch. I mean, come on! Early Monkees music without Bob Dobalena? Just won't happen. I'll wait until I find it discounted somewhere or used or something. Can't see spending 60 bucks for Monkees music and not getting Zilch!"
4,"Oh No! Almost perfect, but disappointing enough to say ""No, I can't buy this collection!""","I love The Monkees. Really, I do. But, when I saw this four disc collection, I was ready to bring it home.But No! I can't! Where's ""Mr. Webster""? One of my favorite tracks from ""Headquarters""? How come that great song is not here? They go and put their faggy ""D.W. Washburn"" in this collection, but they leave out ""Mr. Webster""? What an atrocity!Well, they blew it! I guess I'm just going to have to fabricate my own little ""Best of The Monkees"" by borrowing my friend's whole CD library of The Monkees. I guess I can live with that.""D. W. Washburn"", for Christ's sakes. That's disturbing!"
4,Zoo Monkeys,"This is an excellent boxed set, tho I was more than a little disappointed at the omission of the rare zoo version of ""Red Butt, Flung Doo,"" in favor of the more commercial ""Red Balls, Flung Poo."" Otherwise a great box, well worth the hefty price tag."
1,Bad Show!,"I hope I can change this review soon, But as of now I am very unhappy! With CD # 4 missing and damage to the ""Music Box"" CD holder I am most displeased."
5,Monkees songs galore!,I didn't realize how many songs the Monkees had released over the years. It even includs the newer releases as well. Great compilation of songs with a booklet that takes you through each song and tidbits of information. Have enjoyed listening to these CDs many times in my car.
5,"""Heart and Soul"" Jazz Saxophone","Warning - because Shelley Carrol's saxophone will melt you. Shelley's playing is full of human qualities - it speaks, sings, cries, whispers and screams. You'll be surprised to discover jazz music can be this much about heart and soul. If you live in Dallas/Ft. Worth area, I strongly recmmend catching Shelley at live shows. It's quite an experience!"
1,Christmas present from my daughter to her jackass boyfriend at the time,"Star Wars sucks, collecting the garbage associated with it is stupid and who really gives a crap about any of it? Let's move on and hope that Ewan MacGeregor really falls out of his BS flying car for reals in the 27th installment directed by George Lucas' head in a jar."
5,Tuff Scourer,"This baby is awesome! Everything else I have used to date degrades over time, and leaves rust stains behind on the sink in the process. This pad is not only holding tough after 3 months (as far as I can tell it hasn't degraded at all), but was also able to clean the rust spots left behind by the others.Recommend highly."
1,BUMMER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Ring would be perfect if it looked like the one in the picture...The ring i received looks unfinished ... The side crosses needed more edging... Also the black shading is lacking on both sides and top...i will not bother contacting Amazon or seller for it is not worth my time or money to have shipped back... I will try to add more shading myself... If this ring is NOT the exception i do not recommend it...
2,Doesn't taste like pizza crust should,"This stuff was a disappointment to me after reading all the glowing reviews here. The texture was OK; I didn't have any problems with getting the crust to brown, or it being soggy in the middle. The problem was the taste, which I found somewhat reminiscent of bisquick. This stuff just doesn't taste like pizzeria pizza crust, not even close. Looking at the ingredient list I guess it should come as no surprise, since it contains egg, soy, and milk!My suggestion if you want a quick and easy homemade pizza crust without having to make the dough a day in advance, get someFleischmann's Pizza Yeastand follow the recipe on the packet (Amazon's price is ridiculously high, check your local supermarket instead). It's almost as fast to make as the Betty Crocker mix (a few minutes of kneading is required), but the resulting crust is much better. I made one of each on the same night, and the Fleischmann's crust was the unanimous winner."
5,Double the price,"WellI have been using this for quite a while and even though the place where I shop the prices are exorbitant, this vendor's prices are more than double what I pay for it on the retail shelf (I get it for .46 cents a pack)I certainly don't understand how people can afford to pay such dishonest pricing."
3,Fun for the kids,"This product is...okay. It tends to be sticky and difficult to work with. I've tried using flour to give it some strength but it just doesn't work. The taste is fair; I coated the crust with butter and seasoned it up - which somewhat helped. Overall, the dough doesn't hold up to toppings and if you use real mozzarella cheese the dough gets soggy from it. Nevertheless, it's fun for the kids to play with."
4,Great for Camping!,"This product is perfect for camping trips! I discovered these while on a camping/roadtrip to Yellowstone. We traditionally have family pizza night on Sat. and the kids miss it when we travel and camp. This quick pizza dough is the answer. Just add water and you're ready to go! We use the Coleman folding oven and our camp stove to cook them. The dough is very versatile. We use one package per person and we each add our own favorite toppings. It's awesome!! Too bad I can't buy them in my own grocery store. I like them so much I order them from Amazon by the case! I use small pizza pans when I cook them, but if you make the crust thick enough you probably wouldn't need a pan. I also have the pizza pan that you can use over a fire, but I haven't tried it with this dough yet. Anyone else? I made up Pizza making baskets for Christmas presents using this dough and it was a big hit!"
2,Didn't work out at all well for my family,"This makes possibly the worst pizza crust I've ever served my family. The taste is like vaguely sweet paste, the consistency is more porous and spongy than I'd like."
2,Old Timer Bearhead trapper knife,Picture seen is a USA made knife. What u get is a Chinese made knife. They advertise a leather sheath. Did not come with one. It's up to you the buyer. Knife was sold by DealersMart
5,nothing fancy,"nothing fancy, but the product works perfect. i have had no problems for weeks using this with my alarm system!"
3,"Out of date, but still helpful for those who know already","I used this book for years and had a love/hate relationship with it. It got me lost lots of times, but also turned me onto some great rides. The real negative is that the book is woefully out of date and some of the rides have changed drastically. If you use it in conjunction with a more recent guidebook like Mountain Bike America:Moab then you will indeed have a powerful tool for deciphering Moab."
3,Excellent singer; so-so material.,"Karen Wheaton is blessed with a truly exceptional voice. It has a wonderful clarity and range. The problem with this CD is the choice of material. I heard nothing that I could call top-tier. It was consistently mundane. A much better Karen Wheaton CD is the one entitled ""I'm Still Here."""
4,Sarah Bishop Never Gives Up,"Sarah Bishop is the story of a girl who loses all her family and is forced to live on her own. After being accused by the British of a crime she didn't comit, Sarah is forced to flee to the woods and start a new life. The story tells of Sarah's struggles to overcome danger in the wilderness and her attempt to escape the Revolutionary War. I think Sarah is brave because she never gives up, even when times get rough. I feel this is a good book of independence, determination, and bravery. I recommend this book to people who enjoy adventure and excitement."
1,Eh....,"I had to read this book for school.IT IS SO BORING.Don't read it, save your time.It is also so pointless.I mean, there is this 15 year old girl in Revolutionary times, she runs away to a cave, goes somewhere else, and on and on and on!!!DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME."
1,Boring Book,"This book was not good at all. It was boring, lacked detail, and the way it was written was just boring and made no sense at all. The book sounded very good, but when I read it, I regretted it."
4,A Review of Sarah Bishop,"This book by Scott O'Dell is about a fifteen-year-old girl named Sarah Bishop who experiences many hardships. She loses her father to tarring and feathering and her brother to prison. A British officer falsely accuses her of starting a fire. She runs away to a vast wilderness where she lives alone until she is accused of witchcraft. The book is written from Sarah's perspective. It's a really exciting adventure about the revolutionary war era. Sarah Bishop is a story anybody could love. Girls and boys would admire Sarah's courage and the adventures she has. I liked Scott O'Dell's detail to his writing and how he wrote the book in such a way it just made you want to read the next chapter even if you couldn't. The only thing I didn't like was the abrupt ending. If you like adventure, you'll like this book.by a fifth grader at ODC"
4,Sarah Bishop,"Sarah Bishop is a girl born in Midhurst, West Sussex, England. She was fifteen when she came to the colonies shortly before the American Revolution and with her family, settled on Long Island. After the battle for Brooklyn Heights and while New York City was still burning, she fled into the wilderness of Northern Westchester Country. There she finds a cave in the woods. Alone,she makes her home there.The Patriots have made her an orphan without a home. Now the British army is after her for a crime she did not commit.The wild animals, the terrible hardships are not as what she has left behind. Now she will not trust anyone again."
4,Sarah Bishop? Who is she?,"SARAH BISHOP by Scott O'Dell is a revolutionary war book. It is about a girl named Sarah and she becomes an orphan. Her father is killed by some of the men of his village (kind of like KKK). After that happens then she goes and works at a tavern. That is also where she stays. Until she hasn't heard from her brother who joined the army. She goes looking for him and somehow she gets put in jail by the British. She escapes and when she finds her brother he is DEAD. Now that she is running, the British are looking for her. She keeps running and running. Till she finds a cave in a clearing. She makes a home there and the only things she has for company is a bat and rodent. As time pases and problems arise, she still is weary about the British. She keeps wondering and wondering, waiting and waiting. She is wondering when she can live in peace. Will peace ever come????"
4,Sarah Bishop,"Sarah Bishop is about a teenage girl who grew up during the Revolutionary war. Her father was a loyalist and her brother was a patriot. They both were killed. She is an orphan running from the British for doing something she didn't do. The rest of the story is about here experience hiding out in the woods, learning how to adapt, also maturing and growing stronger as the book goes on.I thought the book Sarah Bishop was good book."
4,A Captivating story about a struggling young girl,"Sarah Bishop is a story about a 15-year-old girl named Sarah Bishop, who lives during the American Revolutionary War. Sarah's father is a loyal Patriot who reveres King George by framing his picture above his bed. It is for this reason that the rebels tar and feather him. Sarah's father soon dies. Sarah has no one to sympathize for her, so she leaves her hometown to live on her own. She establishes a home of her own within a cave. During the story's climax, Sarah is wrongfully accused of practicing witchcraft. Overall, Sarah Bishop is an interesting and accurate rendition of the revolutionary war era. I highly recommend this book to people who enjoy historical fiction."
3,Parts of Sarah Bishop are scary,"Sarah Bishop is a book about a girl whose father dies when he is tarred and feathered by Patriots. (Her father is loyal to the king of England.) Sarah is accused of starting a fire by the British. The author does a good job of writing this true story about a 15-year old girl. I learned more about the American Revolutionary War and how it was fought, but I was scared when I heard that Sarah Bishop was in the war."
2,Sara Bishop,"Sarah Bishop was a 15 years old girl who lived during the Revolutionary War. Her father was murdered, her brother wasstarved to death by the British Army. Accused of a crime and on the run, she goes north. Sarah buys a musket and finds a cave to live in. She lives with a white bat, a 3 legged muskrat and she lives off the land. She rescued a man from freezing to death and helped him recover. Then he testifyed against her saying she was a witch.The adventurous parts were ok, I did not like all the parts about the bible it seemed the aurthor was trying to convey his own belief."
5,I love this book!!!!!!!!!!,I absolutely love this book! I had to do a historical fiction book project and it worked perfectly!! It was a great book at times sad but it was still great!
1,Boring book.....,"This book was really boring. It's a historical novel about a fifteen year old girl during revolutionary times. It drags on and on as she basically flees from one place to another. The characters are not developed very well and Sarah does not really establish connections or relationships with anyone. The places where there should be more details and back story there is none and scenes that are not really relevant to the plot there is too much detail. Overall, I didn't think this book was interesting or well written and the only good thing I can say about it is it's historically accurate but the story itself was too dull to keep my interest."
2,A Book,"I thought that Sarah Bishop was pretty good. I wouldn't recomend it to many people though because it's sad. The general plot was easy to follow, with some unexpected twists, that gave the book more life. I would recomend it to the age group of 9-14. It needs to be more active and descriptive. The book was only good enough to finish reading, it wasn't a book I would have picked for myself. It deffinaitly made Johnny Tremain easier to understand. Over all I thought that Sarah Bishop wasn't that great."
3,OKAY,I had to read this book for school and at first I thought it was okay than it got boring than exciting than boring. not one of the best books i have read but i thought it was average. but historical events aren't really my thing.
5,"Wow wow wow wow, fantastic","saw it few years ago and loved its color, skating, just beautifully done. Has a wonderful store for all ages to enjoy forever."
1,Underwhelmed!,"Bought the wheel cover, on the chance that it would probably fit. Ok, that's my fault...""fits most"" should have been my clue, I guess.The main problem, however, was that the cover smelled like burnt rubber! After two days of trying to deal with it, I threw it out, with the trash..."
3,Too Big for my Honda CR-Z,Looked great. Just too big :( wish they offered in a smaller size. Then I wouldn't be returning. I would be exchanging. Too bad.
2,Avoid this item,"This would be a great product that would earn 4-5 stars if it were not for 2 problems. First is the warning in small print on the item's packaging that states, ""This product contains chemicals, including lead, known... to cause cancer and/or birth defects or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling this product.""! How can Amazon sell this item? Secondly, this thing smells bad. And it's a strong, bad smell. It fills my garage with it's stench. I have already contacted Amazon regarding the return of this product. I will avoid items from this company (auto expressions) in the future. The only reason I gave two stars instead of one is because despite the above listed failings, I still like how it looks."
3,smells funny,"it's a good price compared to wal-mart but it's kinda thin and it smells funny when new i like it thought it feels nice and wans't impossible to put on and it's pretty you gotta stretch the heck out of it to get it on but, it won't break so go ahead"
3,Too loose for Toyota Prius,I bought this and realize it is too big for my Toyota Prius 2011. The look of this product is great.
4,"Great looking wheel cover, ""okay'' build quality.","After 16 months of extensive usage I have to say that the wheel cover still is present on my wheel. It perfectly matches my blue ford fiesta because of it's color, but it only took a month before one of blue foams started to come off. After 16 months it's starting to lose a lot more, but I'm still impressed. For the price it's a great buy, I'd just go for something a bid more reliable if you have the money to spend."
5,Nice!,I use in a Jetta..and looks just Nice!!...Blueish match with car audio dash and speedometer..go for it!!...just keep it safe of direct sun light..as any rubber item should be...
1,Will no fit,"I purchased a Tampa Bay Buccaneers wheel cover for my Jeep Wrangle. The cover was 14 1/2 "" X 15 "". I have a stock 2007 Jeep Wrangler. The steering wheel measures 16"" across. No possible way for it to work. It's a shame too. I loved it. Maybe ad dimensions on merchandise like this to save customers time and money. I'm Still a loyal customer but was dissatisfied with this purchas"
3,well made but...,this was too loose a fit on a Kia Rio. I already had one on my Corolla which fits excellent. Kia wheels must be of a smaller diameter
5,great,"too lazy to write a long review, but yea it's great!took FOREVER to get it on the steering wheel but i guess that's a good thing!"
2,Doesn't fit 2013 Ford Focus SE,"This item looks pretty nice on the shelf, but it is the second steering wheel cover that I have purchased that doesn't fit (this one will also be going back). I suggest any of you who are thinking of getting this to measure your steering wheel first. This says it fits 14.5 to 15.5"" diameter, and I can't get it more than 2/3 of the way on. It's not very stretchy, either."
5,Blue Steering wheel cover,I like my blue wheel cover. They matched the seat covers I ordered from Amazon. My car really pops with this wheel cover.
4,Nice wheel cover,"Does have that rubber smell to it, been in the car for 2 weeks and still my hands smell, other than that great cool looking cover. Great at night time and when light hits, it reflects. Saw the same one at auto zone in blue/black and red/black."
4,"Looks Great, Too Big...","LOVE this steering wheel cover! Color and feel are exactly what I was looking for. Slightly too big for my 2013 Mazda CX-5 Sport's wheel so slips & slides around sometimes, but its still a great product."
2,no lead please,"This product contains lead, wash hands after use.That was the warning attached to the packaging of the wheel cover. I am sure that the amount of lead is so small that it has virtually no health effects, but still, I would rather have a cover that has no lead. I am in contact with the steering wheel every day and I rather have one that I don't have to worry about.It was also a pain to get on my steering wheel. I had to use a screw driver to get it on and I would have taken it off by now, but I don't want to have to fight it. I think I will have to cut it off.On a positive note, its temperature does remain pretty constant. I don't remember thinking it was to hot or to cold."
1,Did not fit my 2002 Moutaineer,So apparently it doesnt fit trucks so dont buy it if your looking to fit it in your truck. It ripped as we were installing it and stretched entirely off the steering wheel within a month. No good
2,Strong fumes,Returned it due to not fitting my steering wheel though it was supposed to fit according to the car model search. It also had very strong fumes. The blue is also very reflective which was not obvious in the photos.
4,Steering Wheel Cover,"Nice product. Very comfortable grip, but doesn't protect hands against cold weather. Seller provided fast shipping."
1,Tore when applying,Very difficult to get on. Cover ripped while trying to get on. Within recommended measurement that should have fit.Would not recommend to others.
