3,Just 'Hanging' Out,"My five month old son is a bouncer, so I thought this would be a great thing for him. Wrong. He just hangs their pathetically and twirls around on his toes. It offers little support for him so he just flops around in it when he tries to jump. It was made up of good materials but he never uses it, he'd much rather sit in his bouncy seat and play with his toys and bounce then swing around in a little contraption that offers no amusement."
2,Surprised not more injuries!,"I put my 6 month old in this and while she loved jumping and spinning in it, the bucket is so wide and she leans so far forward her head nearly smacked both door frames if I hadn't been sticking my hand up to block her! I didn't feel it was really all that jumpy, either, and the spring made an annoying sound. I'll be returning this for one that has a smaller seat area and a tray or a bumper to keep her from hitting her head. It was also tricky to get her into it, as well. I don't recommend this at all."
3,My 6 month old used it for a little bit,It's ok. I think it's just my daughter she didnt really like being locked up in there. She liked me swinging it few times but she started walking at 10 months and wasnt interested in her mobile or the jumper... but i like it cause it's light and easy to hook and unhook
3,Its a bumpy ride,Bought a Johnny Jump up to use when I would be taking showers but didnt care much for it bc my baby would always hit into the doorways with it when boucing it tends to swing from side to side causing him to bump his head on the door panel. I would pack comforters next to him but it became more work than it was worth so I stopped using it.
3,Awkward,I was looking for a bouncy for my 7 month old and he really loves it but my main concern was the safety of the bouncer. The picture depicts a baby sitting in properly but when I place my son in he looks awkward sitting in it. It's like he's ready to topple over. No matter how much i re positioned him it just didn't feel comfortable.
5,baby jumping,"Hi Moms and Dads, this is not the jumper thats for sale but I wanted to post to show you the fun a baby can have with one of these jumpers, enjoy................. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-QW-N6cqnQ"
2,Just so-so,"The thing is just not ""springy"", it's too stiff. It's also a pain to put the child in or out. My son could never make it bounce. Not at 12 lbs and not at 20."
2,"Looks good, but doesn't fit our doorframes","Maybe it's because our house is over 100 years old. I don't know, but i read and did all the measurements, but when it arrived it wouldn't fit. It may be because from the edge of the door frame to where the top ledge part is quite long. I wish the description had been better because then I would have known this, but there wasn't even a picture of what the attachment looks like."
3,Decent Product,This jump up was what we expected. The instructions were easy to follow and it has a very sturdy spring and clamp. Our only advice would be for smaller babies. Our 5 month old is short and her mouth hits the front (which is a metal bar under the fabric). Our solution was to place a rolled up blanket in front of her.
2,Okay,"This a fine jumper, but my baby {eight months} tries to jump in it, and is distracted by the rope. He can barely move his head around freely. He also has to keep his arms out because of the rope and he wants to play, and cannot really in this."
1,"No bouncing, just dangling","We thought our 5-month-old daughter would be able to ""bounce"" using this product, but she can't. I'm assuming there is a spring encased somewhere in plastic? I can't really tell! If there is a spring, it's too flexible and doesn't provide any resistance. Also the protective plastic casing gets stuck. So even if the spring worked, the casing kills off any ""bounce"" the spring may have provided. Our daughter is content to dangle in this thing for a few minutes, but then she gets bored and cries. We're going to donate this product to Goodwill and try to find a bouncer that works."
2,WIDE SEAT,"At 9 months old my 27"" baby still hates the jumper I think because the seat is too wide for her legs to straddle comfortably. Plus when I tried adjusting to the right height, the thing was too high, then too low... and baby was a pain to keep putting in and taking out of the seat. She fussed and wiggled too much. Oh well... glad it works for some babies (and parents)."
3,Spring Design Flaw,"We wanted a portable jumper for our baby and liked the cute design of the fabric on this, but found a problem with the mechanism of the spring. It comes with a spring that has to be compressed by the child bouncing rather than a spring that gets stretched and then springs back when the baby bounces. Our baby isn't heavy enough to compress the hefty spring. We ended up taking the spring mechanism apart and replacing the spring with a type of spring that gets stretched out when the child bounces...all parts were purchased at a hardware store and cost us under $6. Now our baby LOVES it."
2,Baby needs to work hard to jump,"The good thing is that, except for the spring, the jumper is pretty nice. Unfortunately, the spring is THE most important part and it is not good. It has low elasticity and our baby did not like it as he had to push really hard to get anything exciting out of it. We gave it away for free and will buy a different one for our new baby girl."
3,Top Must Come Beneath Baby's Armpits,"I bought this for my four month old daughter, who insists on being held in a standing position all the time. I thought that the johnny/jenny jump up would be the perfect solution, especially since she is able to hold her head up. however, the instructions in the box say that the rim of the jump up must come below the armpits of the baby. my baby is still too small, so her arms are tucked inside and she doesn't like it. i've put it away until she grows a little bit, and hopefully she'll like it then. also, make sure that this fits on your type of door frame. do the research and make sure that your door frame is within the size limit: [..]"
1,Do not buy,"I got this for my daughter who is 5 and a half months, and she loves to jump. I thought this would be perfect. She weighs 17 pounds and the mechanism that encases the spring makes it too difficult to get any sort of bounce. I have to put almost all my weight on it to make it bounce at all (125 lbs). It is a joke. The plastic casing around the spring rubs and makes it difficult to get a bounce. This item is definently a NO from me."
2,"Nice, but could not use it","We bought it to hang on the door frame. Unless you have an extra extra wide door frame, this jumper would not work well. When my daughter sits on it and moves around, she will bump to the sides of the door frame. After a couple of tries, we decided to return it and bought her a walker instead."
1,Terrible spring!,We have two of door jumps - two different brands. One that works perfectly and this one. The inner spring is not smooth at all!! Baby has a harder time jumping. Spend $15 more and get a good one.
4,well worth it!,"I got this because it so closely resembled the jumparoo that I played in for hours when I was a baby. It's a classic design that still works today! I love that I can take it down and store it in a very small space when it is not being used, and it is easily washable (important if you have a ""happy spitter"" like my son). Two caveats: first, if you have a petite or preemie baby you will need to use a thin blanket or towel to help fill in the seat and make it comfortable for him (our son was 11 pounds and 5.5 months old in thE pictureS I attached). Second, make sure that you have ledges over the top of whatever hall entrance or door you plan to use this on. I wasn't careful about checking this when I bought the item, and unfortunately there is only one arch that this will work in, all other doorways don't have enough room between the top of the door edging and the ceiling to place the hefty clamps that keep this jumper up and safe. HAPPY JUMPING!"
3,It's just ok...,"The spring is very tight and the main support strap rubs noisily on the plastic protective spring-covering which, in my opinion, is poor design. My son had a little trouble actually bouncing because the spring is so tight. This jumper is just ok. He did like being in it for short periods of time and liked dangling and spinning around in it, but we like our Jumperoo a lot better."
4,loves it,"my son loves it, he is almost 7 months old and 19 lbs and can really jump in it well. we got it for him when he was about 5 months old and he just went from side to side, but even then he liked it. we have large doorways in our living room so it's perfect."
3,didn't work on doors in my old house,Watch out - it doesn't work on some houses that have wider walls and large trim (as often common in older houses). Small doorways also present a danger of the kids banging intot hem - thus best used in wider archway type doors.
5,jump seat,"fabulous! My children loved it. I think that it helped their leg muscles develop, as they were both early walkers. THis jumper seat would entertain them endlessly. A household favorite for a few months"
3,great at first,I got this for my son as a gift. When he was smaller it was perfect. When he was about 4 months. I placed him in it today (at 6 months) and the straps that hold the seat snapped off and he landed face first into the floor. Very scary. Never using this product again. Worked well for awhile though
2,Too short,"I liked some features of this, but Graco makes a better jumper that is more stable. This one wouldn't even come close to touching my floor either. We have high ceilings in our house and I had to return it b/c the poor baby was swaying in mid air and the jumper didn't even balance well for me to consider putting a stool or something under him to kick off of."
3,Look at your doors before buying!,"I was very excited about this jumper when I recieved it for a shower gift. I was disappointed however, when it came time for my daughter to use it. We have an old house so the doorjams are longer than in newer house. Our jumper does not fit on ANY of our doorjams :("
2,Wonderful...until it stopped working.,"My daughter (7 months) loved her Jenny Jump Up; it kept her entertained for relatively long stretches up time, great for keeping up with housework on my end. However, after a month of use the spring device that enables the jumper to, well, jump became ""sticky"" (for lack of a better word) and jumping is no longer possible...too bad."
5,"Wonderful product, Baby loves it :)","Bought this for our little one at Christmas time, and come March, he still uses it daily. He can spend about an hour in there happily jumping around. He's learned that he can spin now and that makes it a lot more fun for him!I definitely recommend this product to anyone who needs free hands. We also love that we can move it VERY easily!"
1,Seriously?!,Can this really be classified as a jumper?! The spring might as well be stuck! It doesn't bounce at all. I can't believe Evenflo would even attempt to sell this terrible product. Such a waste of money. I'm disappointed!
5,A Mimi MBA Course in Successful Business Partnering !!!,"The author has presented a practial nuts and bolts book in developing successful business alliances and partnerships. He distinctly focuses upon the critical success factors, determination of the value equation for partnering and lists the pits and traps to avoid. His examples drive home the points that must be retained to develop your partnering skills.I have used the techniques in ""The Art Of Partnering"" to successful establish domestic and international business alliances. I have also found it to be useful in my personal dealing."
4,Performs well,"Good product, delivered as described and performs well. easy installation with just a small wrench. Heating value is not very good with any ventilated system, but it's not the fault of this product."
5,Charming Romance,"We enjoyed this film. It is hard to do romantic comedy well- and most film makers do not try to do more than provide an adequate workmanlike product following the familiar formulas that have worked before. Some folks would say that this film also followed the formula and to some extent that is true but there were some significant departures that added real poignance to the story. It helps that the female lead was the luminous Sarah Roemer, who also also shined in the fabulous, and literally riotous, Brazilian comedy ""Romeo and Juliet get Married"" (A romantic comedy that is also the all time greatest satire on soccer fans ever made- and yes I have seen the original English version of 'Fever Pitch'). Sarah has made my personal list of favorite actresses. In this film she continued to display the same sure touch and sense of timing. However, the rest of the cast also did very well."
1,waste of time,I rented this to watch. Atleast now I know I don't need to buy it! It was verrry boring and slow. There is no real plot and it is a complete waste of time watching. Not to mention the fact that they must have ran out of real actors so they through in Snoop Dogg. There is more background music than people talking or anything going on in the movie. Almost the entire first 5 minutes is just music...pointless. Recommend renting it before buying to make your own choice. Prepare to be bored!
1,just....bad,"My boyfriend suggested that I read this book because he thought it was awesome. After I finished, I thought ""that was very FAR from awesome."" I don't think I'll take a reading suggestion from him again after that huge blunder.This book is terribly written. Everything is just so predictable and it definitely tries way too hard to be ""angsty"". The main girl (I forgot her name) is so badly stereotypical...God, I can't even finish this review cause the book was that bad. THE CHICK LOSES ALL OF HER SKIN! if you're into stuff like that, then I guess you'll be into this."
5,"Thank you, Esther, for another great anthology!","As a fan of the warrior woman genre and the humor fantasy genre, I absolutely loved this book! Reading it along with the first one made for a great afternoon, especially since one author chose to write a continuation of her first story (Elizabeth Moon, write more of this stuff, please!). The dedication made me laugh out loud and immediately head to my e-mail to spread the fun."
1,BE CAREFUL!,"Baxter Super Close Shave, is a very deceiving product. It's claims of no irritation are false. The very first day I used it, my face felt very good. But, even with using a brand new razor, The Super Close Shave product allowed for many knicks because it is fast drying. I don't recommend this product, the next day, I began to break out in pimples, and the product continued to irritate my face. I used it for several days, and no matter how much, or how little, I had the same bad experience."
1,Not For Me,"This magazine concerns Christian subjects, themes and interests. It was not of interest to me. However, it was well made with color photography."
3,You get what you pay for,A little less than $30 including shipping will get you some pieces of plastic that when assembled will become the media rack above. A word to the wise: careful with how you insert DVD/BRDs; push them all the way in before letting them rest on the rack because they might fall through. The plus side though is that dust may not collect as much with this particular design.
1,Looks like a bargain,"BUT IT""S NOT i bought my little girl one of the SHE LOVED IT until it broke the cheap things got a plastic reiforced neck"
3,Better Than Expected,"Cremains is a low-budget but better-than-expected anthology-style horror program. In the first episode, a woman travels to the haunted town of Wyndham, Mississippi (evidently the Arkham of the Deep South), to become the sacrificial victim of a sinister force that emerges only once in a blue moon--literally. The second episode is non-supernatural, with a serial kiler stalking and murdering teen-age boys. The third episode features everyone's fave horror theme, lesbian vampires. And the fourth episode involves an experiment in necromancy that goes horribly wrong (and also provides the basis for the framing sequence through which the four stories are told).There are some technical lapses, as noted in the other reviews, mostly with the sound, but I give this movie credit for attempting something more than the usual rehashed EC-style horror tales."
1,"Poor quality welds, the other reviewers are right. Do no buy.","When I opened the box, I could immediately see a hole of about .25"" in diameter at the weld. Very disappointing, as other reviewers have pointed out. See the image I posted in the customer images section.The other welds are sloppy at best.Do not buy this product, the welds are absolutely terrible."
1,Seam between outlet chambers isn't even welded.,"Seam between outlet chambers isn't even welded. Other welds are ok, not pretty but at least exist. Makes for nice exhaust leak and extra work at install to fix. Very bad workmanship."
3,Useful but could use improvement,"A fairly useful text but really needs an index. At least one instance of a chord ( a G(alt)) is not shownIn the chord list in the appendix. The major problem is sparcity of extended chord progression examples:actual notation examples would have been helpful vice lists of song titles.I was expecting a book I could use as a refference manual. This book isn't. However, as a self-teachingtext (the ""now-you-try-it"" exercizes are a nice touch) it is well worth the cost."
2,My opinion about chord progressions for songwriters,"I recently purchased the book chord progressions for songwriters. I was hoping to learn popular chord progressions.When I read the book, I was a little bit disapointed.The book covers indeed chord progressions, but does this on ato theoretical manner. I think it's good to use this book as a sort of enceclopedia for songprogressions, but certainly notas a way to learn to play popular tunes. Now I've decided to put the book aside and buy the DVD ""Piano for life"".[...]I think this will help me more."
2,Downtempo Noise,"I made a mistake by buying this without listening first.I rarely like downtempo music, and I liked this less than usual.To me, it was more noise than music."
3,Review of the Mahjongg,This game is okay after I have gotten tired of the falling blocks game.It really is not an exciting game. If you have the falling blocks game on CD-rom please let me know because that is the ultimate best game.
5,Beyblade G-rev Vol.2,"This series of DVDs is the thrid season of beyblade, G-revolution, uncut, meaning they have subtitles and won't be dubbed in english.Also i rather this product not suffer a bad rep."
1,ScrewThis,"Beyblade, Lets watch cartoon people beyblade, how exciting/Yeah Right. For People Who are obsesed with it and must own everything about it I give it a 4, But for us normal people,a 1 out 5"
2,Just pray you don't need service,"This umbrella is a quality product, but unfortunately, the packaging did not adequately protect it. Mine arrived with a bent rib and a broken base cover. I decided to try working with the manufacturer to get the broken parts replaced. That's when the fun began. The folks in customer service were nice, but ineffective. Their operation reminds me of a Chinese Fire Drill. Every few days my ""case"" was referred to another representative. Ultimately the service manager took over but didn't answer emails. After a month had gone by with still no replacement parts, I finally gave up and returned it."
5,Patio Umbrella By Southern Patio,"Southern Patio, who sells this product, was very good with customer service! The umbrella arrived with parts missing from the base, and when I contacted the Southern Patio customer service number, they apologized, and sent me an updated version of the base free of charge, postage paid, that was even better than the original! I would definitely recommend this merchant!"
4,Screen is kind of hard to see.,"The Casio E-11 is definitly one of the earlier PDA's.First of all the the screen is kind of dark.Second of all it is way to bulky for a B/W screen, I mean my dad's Palm IIIXE is like half the size. Still the casio has a digital voice recorder (which is pretty cool) and Windows CE is a lot more like a desktop than Palm."
4,"Took forever to arrive, but it is great!","Wasn't aware of how long it would take to receive the CD (didn't realize I ordered it from an overseas seller..) The CD itself is in great shape and it sounds good too! Faith No More is my favorite and anything ""different"" is even better!"
5,Six Thumbs Up for Six Feet Under,"The first two seasons of ""Six Feet Under"" are quirky, unusual, and different - it's not every day that you find a TV show that deals head on with death yet still somehow maintains a playful sense of humor.As satisfying and rewarding as a good play, film or novel, this series is nonetheless definitely not for the timid. This disturbing, provocative show often makes its viewers uncomfortable - this is a show that asks its viewers to think and respond, not just sit and be passively entertained.""Six Feet Under"" is an excellent show in the same league (in terms of the quality of its writing and the acting of its ensemble cast) as ""The Sopranos,"" ""The Wire,"" ""The West Wing"" and ""Deadwood."""
1,Boke within a week.,Very pretty but don't get used to it.It broke in 2 places and I take very good care of and am careful withmy jewelry. Very disappointed.
2,Poor sound and low reliability rating,"The sound is OK, but even VBR or 128 MP3's sound hollow with the standard earphones. The preset equalizer modes are a joke.My device stopped working after the first month, without being subjected to any abuse. At that point I discovered that Compaq's warranty service is really bad. If you have to ship the unit back for repairs, you will pay for shipping and insurance out of your own pocket. Then they take forever to fix it... Too much pain. I would not buy this one again."
5,feature rific,"Comes with NMhydride rechargable batteries that can be charged while in the unit. Also, the player reads the mp3 into its ram effectively making it skip free (after the initial read of a few seconds). CD burning is fine, I use the standard Joliet file system and the player read all of my disks so far. I recommend this player over the others out there due to price and features."
5,Interested in Growing & Cooking with Herbs,"After reading books by Susan Wittig Albert I became interested in spicing up my meals with home grown herbs, but didn't really know how to get started. Susan mentioned Marge Clark as a good reference source in one of her books, so I ordered this book, ""It's About Thyme"" and was delighted to find lots of information about growing different herbs as well as delicious recipes. It's written in an easy to understand style from someone who obviously knew what she was talking about. I attended an herbal luncheon recently where Susan Albert was the guest speaker and the chicken breast entree was topped with pesto mayonaise made from one of Marge's recipes. Delicious! I also highly recommend Susan Wittig Albert's China Bayles series for all of you ""who-dunnit"" fans!"
5,Great Gift for Beginner,"I selected this set for my son who is 17. He loves it and actually enjoys shaving with it. My plan was to order a more exepnsive set if he liked this one, but I really can't see the need. It's a very nice set."
4,Shaving set,I bought this for my uncle whose from the old school and likes to shave with a razor. He's enjoying it very well. He likes the soap that came with it gives a good lather.
4,Great Starter Soap+Brush,"This was the first shaving soap and brush that i have bought. I became interested in shaving soaps after i became frustrated with the waste and poor shave quality of aerosol shaving creams. I also liked the masculinity of making my own lather. The soap is wonderful, and feels amazing on your skin, and it gives a very smooth shave. I did not give this product a 5, however, simply because i have nothing else to compare it to. How do i know there isn't something better? Anyway, great product overall."
3,Decent Buy,"Nothing exceptional about this product. It takes a while to get a good lather, but once there is, it goes on my face well. The brush like in other reviews isn't that great. It is a little too coarse for my liking. I'm sure there are more options in the market. My advice is look around for a better brush, the soap is good but i actually just started using a regular bar of soap and it works fine. that's just my opinion.*Disclaimer* This is My Mother's Account. She bought it for me, She is not using this product, i don't think...."
5,Shaving Kit,The order was handled in a professional manner and the service was great. I have since ordered from the vendor.
2,ITS FAIR,"ACTUALLY ITS NOT TOO BADIn My Own Experience This Set Is Really A Pretty Neat Deal.OK The Brush is good tho a bit smaller than many would like, I mean I liked mine and the hairs didn't fall out like so many complain of.So My Experience Was A Bit Different!.....The Soap Im not -Super Fond- of OK.It lathers pretty good and I really liked the scent but the bottom line is its 'Not Really' that effective as a shaving soap.Now I didn't really mind the Perfumy Oils as they rather soothed my face but again after pass 2 my face had way too many hairs left for me too be happy with this and I was using a new Astra Blade too tho to be honest my bread is pretty tough.I think this is another case of you get what you pay for here.But do remember you can dump the soap and put a better brand in the bowl as it is reusable.This reminds me a lot of the old Williams shaving soap we used back in the 70s so it will take the hair off your face.But you gotta work at it a bit.Nuff Said.Indiana ED"
1,piece on junk,Do not buy this... The brush started falling apart during first use... It is not worth cheaping out on this kit.Just buy quality supplies separately. The soap is ok but everything else with it is cheap and ultimately a waste of money.This is my first kit and I already have used better quality products and it makes a world of difference. DO NOT BUY
4,Anniversary Present,"I purchased this set as part of a present for my boyfriend for our five-year anniversary. He had been wanting to try a badger hair shaving brush after reading some reviews in a magazine. However, he had no experience with shaving brushes at all. I thought that this looked stylish and would be a good way to see if he liked brushes before dropping lots of cash on a badger hair one.We both really liked the style of the set and also how little space it takes up. He enjoyed the brush. However, his skin reacted adversely to the soap.I suggest this set for other curious shavers, but please buy a different soap if you have sensitive skin."
4,Great shaving cream and brush!,"I thoroughly enjoy shaving with this soap and brush combo. The soap has a great refreshing scent and gives an invigorating cooling effect because of the menthol. It is easy to lather, and provides good protection and moisturizes well. The brush whips up a great lather, but when using on the face it is a little stiff. After use, it does seem to have softened up some. Overall, I am very satisfied with these items!"
5,Bought 4 Omega Shaving sets--they love it!!,"Decided to get all my guys (DH and 3 DSs) ""safety razors"" for Christmas this year. I got this shave set for each of them. I figured I would just start them out with something, (this product already had good reviews) and they could change to something else later if they wanted to. Well, they all love this as well. It moisturized the face without being too much, not drying, has a nice scent, a little menthol, but nothing overpowering, or mediciny smelling. My guys are ages 18 to 48, so i can say for the most part, men of a wide age range love it. The brush is stiff but also soft enough on the face. We haven't noticed hairs falling out of the brush, so i think its pretty good quality. Also, the soap bowl has a lid on it, which keeps it clean, and keeps it from drying out. They were all very pleased with this gift and a couple of them immediately shaved with all their new tools."
3,"It's a decent product, but there are better options","The soap is pretty good in this kit and it lasts forever. (and it smells nice) The brush does its job alright, but it doesn't hold water great and it takes a really long time to break in. (it's boar bristle, not badger) For the same price or less you could get the Tweezerman badger hair brush and a bar of shave soap that will end up being a better deal for the money."
2,OK case,"This is a basic silicone case. It fit the Zune well. However, this does not come with the screen cover. That is my only gripe. Shipping was quick."
3,4 locks & you only get 1 key,you get 4 locks and only 1 key. yes they are keyed alike... but why not include 4 keys? Not even a spare should this one get lost. When my package arrived the locks & key are in a clear hard plastic shell. the seal looks like it was sliced open and maybe somebody removed extra keys? the key wasn't on a ring like in the picture. The description is very vague about the # of keys that are supose to be included.
3,The Christmas Wish,"The box was broken in two places and when the tape was taken off the box it's sticky on the side and I can't seem to get it off. I don't know where I can store this box without getting it on other dvd containers. The dvd played just fine, I just wish the box was in better condition."
4,Heartwarming story,"A nice little holiday film. Heartwarming, keeps your interest with a bit of a twist. This viewer was suprised. I'm a Neil Patrick Harris fan so pretty much anything he does I like."
5,Classic Christmas,This movie relates to young and old and reminds us not to jump to conclusions and always look for the good. Nice message and wonderful heartwarming movie.
5,Tale of a favorite time of year,"A welcome addition to my growing colleciton of Christmas movies, be they good or bad. Debbie Reynolds is a timeless actress and there is a nice twist at the end."
2,"OK, but repetitive","A Very English Agent was just an ok read. Lots of satire, but it wearys you as our hero (or anti-hero) narrates his exploits as an agent of the crown. The settings and targets of his subterfuge change, but it's basically the same ol', same ol' being told over and over and over. I lost interest pretty quickly in spite of a chuckle here and there, and struggled to finish. I made it, however, all the way to the anti-climax where all (or nothing) was revealed, but I found I didn't care anymore."
4,Families: USA,"I have a hearing problem or this would probably be 5 stars.I think this is an excellent example of teaching kids about how other people live. Besides that, I enjoyed it!Since I have access to them, I'm planning to look at a few more.BobDenver"
1,"BAD, BAD BAD MOVIE","The first attribute of a good movie is---it should look like a movie. Who wants to watch a play on film. We go to movies to escape reality, not to watch live skits. Surprisingly, the acting was acceptable, but the story line and camera angles were pathetic.The two shorter extra movies were actually better than""The Night Divides the Day""..TNDTD was unoriginal, stretched out with those uninspiring stories around the campfire, and very predictable. This was a Middle School Project at best. while I will retain my copy,it will probably be a lonely , boring, desperate day beofre I view this one again."
4,Hmmm,"It's hard to review this mix without cursing. It's pretty good. Due to the shear energy of it, it might not be something you feel just any old time, but when you're in the mood to just go overboard on Gab lyrics there's rarely going to be anything hotter than this. It reminds me of a personal mix I'd make just to hear everything I like about a particular artist all at once. It's also great to have a number of vinyl only selections on CD now."
3,Other Books,"This is Nigel Tranter's novelisation of how the Clan MacGregor was quite literally royally shafted. Or at least nobly shafted.The clan leaders were in conflict at the time, and needed help. The Earl of Argyll saw tools he could use to further his own ambition and political ends, and tools that were disposable."
4,Giving war a face,War is never a good thing. This book can give us a picture of what we were fighting against. We were not just fighting for our country we were fighting a people. A people with thoughts and dreams for an uncertian future. Let this book be a statement to all that there are two sides to every war.
2,The Long Lost Longarm,"Where has the likeable, smart, sneaky, skirt chaser I have known for 20 years gone? Custis stumbles through this adventure like a DUMB copper badge. His problem maybe that his morning shot of Tom Moore & the other tools of his trade are missing. The MCCHELLAN, SOOGAN, CARPET BAG, CROSSDRAW RIG, WINCHESTER are not there. Neither is the logic & ethic of this WEST BY GOD Virginia transplant. The interaction with other lawmen is okay but doesn't replace detailed interaction with barmaids, waitress', shemale suspects, handsome widows, & heiresses. I'm just glad Evans remembered who should be left alive when the assignment ended."
5,Journey to Spiritual wellness,"Like the reverence felt observing a spectacular sunset this CD takes its listeners on a journey of Spiritual Healing. The dedicated loving care put into each note is evident in each and every moment. The sounds within sounds moved through my body like a Shamans breath, releasing Knots of stress leaving me feeling softly wrapped up and warm. Each time I play the CD is like standing in the arms of an old and treasured friend."
3,Didn't expect Jesus Christ...,"The eclectic mix of chants at the beginning is relaxing and meditative (the reason I bought the cd), but it ends with a guided meditation segment about God and Jesus. That was not in the description of the cd. Also- there are some very deep tones/vibrations that appear in a few of the pieces that I found disturbing and out-of-place. I suspect there are better healing cds out there."
1,Sounds of Light was better,"There's too much caterwauling in this one. Not for meditation, maybe as a quiet background for ambience, I dunno. It didn't quite inspire any transcendental experiences for me."
2,Entry level information,"I eagerly awaited this Cd/book set but was disappointed in what it actually delivered about its subject matter. The companion book text was beautifully rendered but it was almost entirely a compilation of informational ""bits"" from other sources, that might be inspiring for the beginner but are pretty unsubstantial if you are looking for technique. Good for beginners but the serious practitioner will need more. Russill Paul's works are far more informative and his Sanskrit pronunciations (pronunciation being VERY important when healing with sound) are correct."
2,How about just a little tiny instructional drawing?,"So, you get a piece of paper in the box with this thing. It advertises Avery products, but it doesn't tell exactly the step-by-step process for using it. I suppose it should be ovbvious, but I've never used a CD/DVD label applicator and it's not. I think I've figured it out, but it would sure have been helpful just to have a HINT on the instructions as to how this gadget works.Oh..OK...the instructions are on the labels themselves!! Now I feel better."
2,An annoyance.,"The applicator works okay, but it's essentially the same as a CD Stomper applicator I already had. The only difference is that the new one has a couple of slots at the edges to accommodate a change in the labels. For some reason, the smaller cylinder in the middle of the applicator is smaller than the small holes in full print labels, so the side slots help with alignment - except that the extra wings on labels rip off if you aren't careful removing the label from the sheet. It seems like all of that could have been solved with better engineering."
2,Avery CD/DVD Label Applicator,"Avery CD/DVD Label Applicator ( 5699 )Label alignment is still tricky, even with this device. Labels will not lie flat in this device with the adhesive side facing up. You have to improvise to some extent."
2,the spindle was too small for the labels,this spindle fits 2 sizes of label holes. But I still can't find one to fit a bunch of label I bought where the hole is just under 1 inch.
2,Dumb man can't do nothind right,"no instructions leave me in the dark. used lots of paper disks = = = waste. if i ever learned how to use this disk program I would more likey to enjoy way of putting the disks on recorded disks. Not your fault, just mine. Maybe one day I will learn."
5,MUST have,A must have if you are into CD duplication in a moderate way.Works every time if you follow instructions
4,Works well for me,This is the first device of this type I have owned and I am quite happy with it. It works the way I hoped and expected.
3,Not Exciting,"The Avery CD/DVD label Applicator does indeed do it's job but it falls short in two ways:1) It didn't come with detailed instructions (It didn't come with ANY instructions, actually). It should be a no brainer just looking at it because what you see is what you get, but it doesn't necessarily make it obvious2) It doesn't apply labels perfectly each time. Memorex makes a stamper that actually comes with instructions AND makes sure your labels don't curl when applying them to the disc. Even if your labels do curl, the Memorex model ensures your label is applied evenly so you don't get air bubbles. With Avery, you'd better be patient and steady.In conclusion, it's not pretty, it's not perfect, but for the price, it gets the job done."
3,Great Idea,I found it difficult to use because the cd labels curled up. My husband ended up putting the labels on by using a screwdriver to hold the edges down. Great concept. Perhaps different brands of labels are better than others.
1,BY HAND ONLY,"Unless you have some hand shaking disorder apply your CD labels by hand. It is much easier and much more accurate than peeling off the curling label, placing it upside down on the applicator, and then placing your CD upside down on top of that. Trust me. Don't bother with a CD label applicator!"
5,Does what it Should,"At first, I thought it might be a waste of money since it isn't that much different than putting the label on a DVD which is piled up on other DVDs. Then I figured out how to turn the little grey part in the middle so it stands up. Now that I understand it, I'm glad I purchased this and will get much use out of it as I test market my home study course ""Bring out Your Inner Bodyguard in Two Weeks or Less."""
2,Lousy product,If you are putting on full face labels don't use this. Once you remove the center piece to try to put on a full face label it will wobble on the way down and it is impossible to get the label centered. It will work fine for other labels. Great idea. Poor implementation.
5,yes!,"Quality, fun shirt. I bought this in a size large for my husband in Sept of 2006 and didn't see any others like it at the time. He loves it, gets thumbs up from others when he wears it and I'm thinking of buying a second for when the first one has been worn and washed too many times to look presentable. I'll buy from EMO again, as I believe they're the first to print this design. Shipping was expedient, too. Thanks!"
3,Plush Transfomers?,When I saw this toy I thought it was cool and ordered it. When it finally came I was very ticked off . The plush is barely 6 in. The pictures make it look like the size of a pillow. That's all I have to say.
4,From The Eyes Of A Roller Derby Fan,"I have all three of the Roller Derby books...Five Strides On The Banked Track...Roller Derby To RollerJam, and this book. Although it isn't as complete into the hsitory of Roller Derby, it does focus on a few of the ones who were the trendsetters of the banked track sport. Profiles of Charlie O'Connell, Ken Monte, Buddy Atkinson Sr., his wife Bobbie, Joanie Weston, Ronnie Robinson, and the two original voices of Roller Derby. Ken Nydell and Walt Harris. Great photos of the past. Must be included with the other mentioned books!"
3,Moisturizing Effect Not Long-lasting,"I used this Body Butter after my daily shower. Thought it would complement my use of the Seal Salt body scrub. It is goes on thick and moisturizes deeply. However, I found that after several hours, my skin felt dry again. (I have to note that it is the winter season when the dry heat indoors makes one's skin drier.) Considering the tube is only 8-oz size, it goes quickly. I had a second tube that I returned.Overall, probably good for the summer or when you don't need deep moisturizing. For deep moisturizing effect, I would suggest Shea products from L'Occitane, either the Shea Butter Lotion (with 15% Shea) or the Ultra Rich Body Creme with 25% Shea. During the holiday season, the Shea Butter Lotion comes in 16.9 oz size, otherwise it's an 8.4 oz size comparablt to the H20 Body Butter in size."
2,Too Thick,I purchased this item after using the H2o Body balm. In my opinion the balms go on alot easier and are non greasy in comparison with this butter. Will not purchase again
1,"Next time, edit the book before publishing!","This book is here to really annoy students and teachers alike. The problems are vague and useless, the examples contain numerous math errors, and the author uses non-conventional notation and random greek letters. Typical problems refer the reader to figures and examples around the book, which combined are still missing half of the problem. The result? Spending half an hour to solve a single-equation problem, ""guessing"" half the values anyway. Some of the diagrams in the book were obviously scanned at a terrible resolution, rendering them unreadable (is it so hard to find a ""legible"" periodic table?)..."
1,Why isn't zero stars an option?,"Clearly, this book slipped through the cracks in the scientific editor's desk, as it contains copious errors in not only math, but concepts also. The end of the chapter problems are ill-posed, as they often refer to 2-3 figures/examples within the chapter that require the student to make baseless assumptions in order to solve the problem.Also, the low print quality and ever poorer figure quality make me wonder where my money went. Perhaps after a couple of revisions, a tight edit, and quality review this book will be worthy to be called a text."
3,A Basic Survey of the Civil War,"After reading A GREAT CIVIL WAR I honestly wondered why Russell Weigley had written it. This is not Foote, nor Nevins, nor Catton. A passable 500 page history, this book could serve as a basic textbook for a survey course of the Civil War. Unfortunately it adds virtually nothing new to the seemingly endless scholarship on the subject.While less dense than McPherson's BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM that book remains the best single volume history of the war (an opinion Weigley endorses in his endnotes).Weigley does a very good job in setting forth the war's root issues of cause and effect. His selection of subjects and the unequal weight he gives to battles is overly subjective, however. His battle descriptions are far too wordy, and it is too easy for a reader to lose the thread in the midst of the action.A good ""introductory"" book to the subject for those unfamiliar with it, Civil War aficionados will find this book less than interesting."
2,Better Books On the Subject,"I was familiar with the late Dr. Weigley. I had met him a couple of times. He was a scholar.However, A GREAT CIVIL WAR is not his best work. Dr. Weigley was an expert on 20th Century Military and Diplomatic History. He was also knowledgeable on the American Army. The American Civil War was not his area of expertise. While the text is brief, I found his frequent references to the 20th Century operational art of war out-of-context, and frankly not appropriate. His analysis of the diplomatic aspects of the American Civil War are the best part of the book.There are better books on the American Civil War. However, there is always something to be learned from Dr. Weigley"
3,More like Bronze Spokeshave Kits,"Let me begin by saying I've looked everywhere for miniature bronze shaves like these for fine edge treatments for a while. The bodies are nicely cast and they are comfortable little tools. The downside is the blades, and while I realize that at about $8 per spokeshave asking for a sharp blade is out of the question at least they could be somewhere in the neighborhood of flat. The bevel on the blades was very nicely done, however it appears that the backs of the blades were ground after the bevel and with little care. The backs are rounded over to a crazy degree after about 25 minutes I got one blade flat enough to take an edge. I've ordered some tool steel and will cut out new blades for these ""kits"" and fettle the spokeshaves for a better fit.The good news is they manufactured the difficult (cast bronze) part of the tool right."
2,Don't Listen to the Abridged Version,"The abridged audio book is terrible. Loretta Swit's reading is awful - especially the southern accents. It was hard to listen to. I am giving it 2 stars, because I can only hope that the book is so much better and fills in all the big gaps. Why Cassidy ever found Claire attractive is not apparent in the audio version. She always is lying to him. What is attractive about that? I like Sandra Brown's books, but will only listen to unabridged versions in the future. (This one did not come in an unabridged version - that I could find...) Also no more with Loretta Swit as the reader."
3,Could have been better.,"This book for some reason or another took me a while to get through it. I guessed what was behind Claires motive real quick, but the ending I didn't expect. I personally don't feel that it was one of her best, but by all means still a good read."
4,Great Read,Probably one of Sandra Brown's best. A fast pace keeps you glued to the book and you won't guess the ending.
2,Did I miss something?????,"After reading and rereading this book maybe it's me but THE MURDER IS STILL NOT SOLVED, WHO DID IT????? did I miss something??????"
3,Maybe 3 stars. Not SB's best.,"Suspense maybe 4 stars, but for romance only 2 stars, I averaged it. The good news about this novel is it reads pretty smoothly and steadily, the bad news is it's a bit annoying with endless questions from the detective and lies from the suspect.... it starts to get old."
2,Annoying!,"I am currently half way through the book, and it feels like an eternity before I'll finish. So far, I've found the characters to be annoying..Cassidy's line of questioning of Claire has nothing to do with the murder investigation, and I find myself annoyed with Claire because why isn't she honest in the first place with Cassidy, and why does she put up with so much crap from Cassidy. Their budding romance is quite slow also, no heat at all! I hope that the rest of the book will be a lot better."
4,"Not Bad, but Not her Best either","I thought French Silk was a pretty good book overall. It did seem to drag on for a while, but at the same time, she fed you enough for you to want to keep reading. Towards the end of the book, the pace definately picked up. There was a definate surprise at the ending, but I have to say I was disappointed on how she just abrubtly ended it. There was never any word on if the suspect was caught or what happened to him. I have to say, I was slightly upset when I finished, but overall it was a good read."
5,karma,"Sometimes you wonder why everything bad happens to me, because to me nothing's right, as I'm not going forward and why all this? The answer is in this book. Sometimes we are surrounded by bad energy that does not allow us to evolve, having a good karma so that everything can flow into our lives the way we want. It's great you know why everything is going so wrong for you to seek help and make your life better."
5,Brilliant,One of the best books I've read dealing with the negative influences of spirit attachments and dark energies. Baldwin provides ways to diagnose and treat various attachments drawing on real life case studies.This is a must have book for anyone concerned about the real influences affecting our lives and how to be free to truly be the master of our lives.
5,Spirit releasement therapy,"Anyone that has experiences with spirits or influences from the ""other side"" needs to review the material in this text. HIs approach provides some good insight and practical techniques in dealing with spiritual influences or supposed emotional dysfunction and disorders.Much of his commentary touches on things I've experience personally and dealt in prayer and meditation however seeing it documented in a manner as he has done is useful in managing people on this side as well as the other. Emotional problems or other states of mental confusion are symptomatic of things not easily seen or perceived.I agree with most his assumptions as to the cause and nature of spiritual beings and phenomena, however his techniques are very useful in addressing many mental and emotional situations and their hidden causes.A very nice compilation of examples, methods and testimonies for those that are interested in this type healing."
4,psychology & supernatural,"An interesting read on recovery of heal from an angle that is different from the naturalistic, secular and atheistic approach that is common in 20th century western culture."
1,Extremely Unconscious Book,"At one time I thought this was the greatest book on earth, but my eyes were opened...i was led into darker and darker situations by the very forces controlling me, that I thought I was controlling. Thinking that using ""the light"" or ""Jesus"" to fight demons, is merely the darkness bringing you deeper into their arena. It's best to study self actualization and awareness and to stop seeking answers outside yourself from ""spirit"" guides who pretend--very convincingly I might add--to be Jesus. A website that helped me get out of this insanity was [...]Thank God I was awakened to the fact I was using demons to try and help folks fight demons--but they were playing with me. I have stopped trying to save others and save myself. The world of spirituality had me focusing on everything that is not of this world, and thank goodness I see today that could ONLY dis-empower me."
1,Ditto,"Every on this unit is poorly made. Some of the allen screws are not capable of fitting with any allen screwdriver due to faulty screw sizes. The entire unit has to be completely re tightened. EVERYTHING IS LOOSE. After assembling the unit, the motor started very easily. When riding, you'll notice that the front wheel is not aligned and not that sturdy.After riding for 10 minutes, the chain fell off. The next week I realigned the chain, yet took quite a few pulls on the starter rope. Well you guessed it, the Starter rope broke off and coiled into the unit. Now I have to open up the starter.. sigh.Don't buy this thing. It doesn't work."
1,Disappointing Razor,"This is the first electric razor I've owned and I'm highly disappointed. The razor works well when shaving my face, but it doesn't shave my neck at all. It is also quite painful when trying to shave my goatee off. The razor pulls the hair off. Considering this razor can only shave half of what needs to be shaved daily it is a huge rip off."
2,Mediore Shaver,"I just got this shaver for Christmas. Previously, I had a 9 year old basic Remington shaver that only worked on my face and not my neck ( it would always cut my neck ). I was hoping this shaver would shave my neck without cutting me. Well, it does. However, it's a very choppy cut and to bother making it clean on the neck, I end up with a bad case of razor burn. As for the face shave, it does a poor job. I got a closer shave with my old 9 year old Remington. Above the lip is a joke. I'll keep trying to get a good shave with this, but for now I'd say it does not shave close, takes a good while to get a clean cut, and burns the neck.The only thing I like is that it's lightweight."
3,so so,It gives a no better or no worse shave than any of the electric razors I have used. You can not shave while the razor is charging like you can on all the other razors I have owned.
4,Good product,"Good close shave, but difficult to clean thoroughly.Holds a good charge and is easy to handle. Popup attachment for sideburns and around ears is great. Would highly recommend it."
1,No cut shaver,The shaver cut worse then the one I have at home with worn out blades. I sent it back to the manufacture and told them of the problem. They sent it back to me. I will never buy a Remington brand product again.
5,Amazingly Fast!,"Fast, fast shaves....go over an area once, and it it done. I can shave in perhaps 30 seconds if time is short!."
2,Decent Shave very cheaply made,I have used an electric shaver for past 20 plus years. This gave a decent shave for the price. However the head cover was very poorly designed and the clip mechanism that holds the pieces together broke within the first two months I owned it. I would spend a little more money for a better shaver.
2,Not as large as advertised,"We wanted a large bread pan and the dimensions stated 11x6 is larger than the standard. The pan we received was 9 1/4 x 5 1/4 which is the standard size, not nearly as large as the dimensions stated."
2,Nonstandard size doesn't work for most recipes,"This loaf pan is larger than the standard size called for by most recipes. Because I'm not comfortable adapting recipes from what's written, that means I never use this pan. I bought this pan because the Baker's Secret loaf pan is recommended by the Best Recipe cookbook folks, but this over-large pan doesn't work with any of the Best Recipe recipes as they're written."
5,Baker's Secret Basics Nonstick Large Loaf Pan,"I had a similar pan that was a hand-me-down and had seen better days. Not to mention, it was too small for baking bread. When I started finding tempting bread recipes, I knew I'd need a new pan. After carefully reviewing my options, I chose this one.What an excellent choice! The pan is solid, well-constructed, and has a finish that is a dream to clean.The breads I've made - from white to banana - come out perfectly browned and never stick. Clean-up isn't much more than a swish-and-wipe in hot, soapy water.Just what I hoped it would be."
2,"Cheap price, but it doesn't last.","I keep buying these because they are inexpensive, but this is definitely a case of getting what you pay for. These receive very light use in my house, and the two that I have (8 x 4"" and 9 x 5"") are not only rusting but now flaking large amounts of silicon. Not worth the hassle and expense of replacing them every couple of years. Do you really want to risk the safety of your family members over a loaf of banana bread?"
5,Good Bread baking pan,I bought this pan to bake loafs of bread in the oven this pan works very well.
5,Awesome!!,"I love this book and have read it atleast 8 times! I love how Rachel gives us Tommy's point of view, and would like her to write another in his point of view!! All the other books are great too! I even got my mom to read this one!!!! Anywho I'd recomend this book to 4th-8th graders."
4,Good but could have been better.......,Overall this was a great book and Rachel Vail is a great author. But it didn't follow up with the last book which stated a new story. It followed up on the first story mainly Zoe's first story. But I have been waiting for a book from Tommy's point of view and it was good. I would probably recommed this book.
5,"Buck Owens Live in Austin City, TX","This is a must have for any true Buck Owens fan. The picture and sound quality is great and Buck is at his best!! You also get to see Buck perform with Dwight Yoakam in this one, which is a real treat!! If you purchase this one, I promise you won't be disappointed. Highly recommended."
4,Buck Owens Live,"This DVD displays the real Buck Owens, it is a great purchase and I recommend it to all you Buck Owen fans out there."
5,BUCK'S BACK!!!,"A terrific DVD which marks the return of Buck to live playing. The band is good and seem to be enjoying this performance. It's unfortunate we had to wait this long, but you can see here what made him so good."
2,Mere Waste of Time,"It is a next example of English humour famous for its very specific worldwide.Staging story of Old Britain mixes surrounding with characters' affairs.The most memorable is the non-stoppable scenes of giving birth, not overshadowed with a natural process of lovemaking preceding."
1,Pathetic. Read the book instead,"Pathetic. Read the book instead. As Steve Coogan says in the film, Sterne's novel was a post-modern novel written before there was any modernism to be post about. Well, okay, but that doesn't provide license to put anything at all on the screen and call it a movie, as has been done here. I'd have been happier with this film if it had approached T.S.in the spirit of Menippean satire rather than in the spirit of postmodern sloppiness. Also, I don't necessarily see Tristram Shandy as conventionally unfilmable. If Lord of the Rings could be filmed, why not T.S.? Maybe the better approach would have been to film only Volume 1 of T.S., keeping in Parson Yorick, his horses, the midwife, the learned jokes and all the animal spirits rather than to have shortchanged the entire novel so shamelessly. Then there'd have been opportunity for eight sequels - an entire ""franchise"" of T.S. movies, just like James Bond!"
2,"For the most part, dull and boring","The book was pure genius. This movie should not have been made. The parts of the movie that are actually taken from the book are good; but they only account for about 20% of the movie. The rest is a bunch of supposedly ad-libed, present day dialog about making the movie, new scripts from America to review, how to shoot scenes, etc. Dull and boring, and those are complements! This film was a total disappointment. Some may think by making the film in this way the movie adds on a layer of irrelevancy to a book that was about irrelevancy. Unfortunately, it fails miserably. Who ever wrote this script was no Lawrence Stern and should have stuck with making a movie based on the book."
2,a horrible mixture,We have more conversation between the actors than we haveof the fictionalization here.The acting may be good what there is of it:just hard to find with all the stuff that isn't really the movie?I gave up on it after about a third of the waysince it never seemed to get past the birthof Tristram Shandy.
3,like the curate's egg: some parts were good,The parts that were actually the novel were excellent. If they'd just stuck to the book it could have been a great film. Some of the interspersed asides about the making of it were enjoyable. But the bulk of the film is a lot of boring true to life (scripted? improvised? who cares?) backstage stuff.
2,"Thankfully, I borrowed the public library copy (details)","This film evolves from the novel (by Sterne) ""...which could never be made into a film."" It still has not.We have two elements here:1. A contemporary attempt (morbidly unsuccessful) to replicate the humor of Monty Python, and,2. A sort of an abysmal ""anti-film.""More important is perhaps what this movie is not: a film conveyance of the novel ""Tristram Shandy."" Most of the scenes concern the PRODUCTION of the film with clips of supposed British wit as the actors and the production crew interact in an impromptu fashion. The entire result is embarrassingly pathetic and, while I personally thought that Monty Python was roll-in-the-floor hilarious, this flick is devoid of practically any levity at all.So unless you can generate a laugh out of watching a window fall, mashing a post-toddler's fake penis, I'd definitely pass this one by.Not recommended."
4,"Challenging, but worthwhile","The professor with whom I read this book touted it as one of the most difficult works of 20th century phenomenology, and I would agree. It's also tedious. But despite this, it repays close reading.The primary topic is how time is perceived by an individual, but this has implications for epistemology, psychology, and ontology.I would not recommend this book to readers with a casual interest because it is a difficult read and other (later) works by Husserl would be more fulfilling for casual readers. However, in the context of Heidegger's _Being and Time_ this work by Husserl is an important precursor and the object of Heidegger's criticism. In this context it is important reading for students of phenomenology."
5,Great Commentary,"This commentary is excellent on the book of James. The author does a great job of bringing out the meaing of the passages and applying it to contemporary times. If you want a commentary with great exegetical studies, this is it!"
5,Great Service!,Item arrived very quickly and in condition as described by the seller. Thanks and will do business again!
2,Collector's Item,"I bought this when it came out.Some of the photography is good and in most cases, the background and props/costumes used for the pictures are far more interesting than Madonna and the ""sexual"" themes she is painstakingly trying so hard to portray.Cold and calculating or at the very least distant. Nothing erotic happening here, but a must for Madonna fans/collectors."
3,Will the real Madonna please stand up.............,"I think many of us approached the Sex book as finally showing us who Madonna is, what motivates and thrills her, sexually or otherwise. Kind of like a secret pact or meeting between her and the reader. But I came away from the book feeling as clueless as ever. She exposed herself without exposing anything. Although the different sex scenarios (being tied up, bisexual acitivity, having a knife held up to one's crotch) were vivid and intriguing, they too quickly became an offering of 90's sexual practices once taboo and now fighting for acceptance, not a true guided tour of M's fantasies. In a way, it is all theater and I wonder if the real Madonna will ever pop out of the hat. But this is probably the only way she can survive. Anyone with this much public exposure will never truly let her audience inside of her head - although the pressure for her to do so is immense."
5,great sex book,This book really opened my eyes up to sex and the endless possibilities there are. I really had a lot of fun reading it. It's too bad that it's out of print. Madonna really knows how to demystify things.
2,No big deal.,"So, what was the hype really all about? I wasn't impressed and paid a lot of money for this because of the intrigue. Maybe it'll be worth something to a collector some day?"
2,Just some pretty pictures.,"I was not too impressed with this book. I didn't find it thought provoking at all. It seemed very posed and contrived, not free flowing and sexually natural. It seemed the explicit nature of the book was done for shock value only."
2,...pfft...please...,...this is rather pretencious in many ways...firstly the lyrics are meant to seem like the average street life for a british teenager and yes they try to do this but you can see the cheese oozing out of every word that he raps in his nu-rave style......now the instrumentals are equally as repetitive mainly lead by the synths with the drums pounding on in the background...no change to the verse chorus structure...no solos or breakdowns...and ends aruptly......not the kind of music I like because it's too simple...just rap with slightly more ravey instrumentals...
3,Another Oxford Kindle Edition for half the price,"I found another Oxford edition for half the price in Kindle books. Only difference is it shows line numbers. For those who find these numbers at odd places on their screen, just adjust front size until they appear at the end of lines. Also for those who are disrturbed about words that had hyphenated endings but now don't, you will have to either accept it or pass on this edition. Finally, an accurate edition of these plays reflects much toil and editing with numerous versions."
1,Willy deserves better treatment,"Useless.Those willing to sit by a desk straining their eyes whilst porring over tiny text in a heavy tome will perhaps go one step further. Do a google search for any Shakespeare text and watch as the relays mount. The texts themselves are searchable and one can look up references quickly and at the speed of your fingertips.Compendium editons are jade's stale nourishment for the drab and the indolent. The print is small, the book is heavy. Get thee to a second-hand bookshop and bargain for single play editions that take hold your fancy. (Arden, Norton, Cambridge, Folger, Signet Classics, respectively)The marginalia by previous owners often provide more substantial insight, references and wit than a wilderness of professional editors could in a millennium of their scribbling. Have your wealthy spinster auntie procure the Norton Facsimile for your birthday and reade him, therefore; and againe, and againe."
2,"Very good, but...unfortunate typo","I had to return this after a year when I noticed that one of Hamlet's lines was missing! An obvious typo. His name is printed in all caps, but the line is left out. It's in Act I, Scene 5. The scene with the GHOST. HAMLET says ""Speak, I am bound to hear."" Except in this version Hamlet doesn't say it.I'm guessing the error must have happened in the conversion from print to digital. It's a very nice edition otherwise and I hope to re-acquire it someday after the error has been fixed. I like that it has Thomas Moore, which Shakespeare is believed to have partly written. The rep at Amazon couldn't have been nicer and said he'd pass on the error to the folks at Oxford."
4,Useful during the rainy season,"It's been raining for weeks here in Southern California and my German Shepherd mix, Jake, manages to find every mud puddle on the path of our daily walks. This towel is a quick way to clean off his paws before bringing him indoors. The size is space saving, although it dirties pretty quickly. I can pretty much only clean off his paws before having to use a separate towel for the rest of his wet fur. All in all, it does the trick and is easier to use on my dog than a standard size towel."
1,You Get What You Pay For!!!,"This is the most ridiculous hat I have ever purchased. It looks good in the picture and I liked the ""not-so-average-cowboy style"". However, this hat's material has no rigitity to it whatsoever, once you have it on your head the brim droops down in the front and in the back making you look like a complete dork!Bailey claims the material is wool felt, yet if there was any wool in it at all it would be somewhat water resistant - which it isn't. Like with many other hats, the leather crown band is subject to constant stretching or tightening. The moment you take it of, the hat's shape collapses into something like a touque!The only better choice is the elastic brow band inside that makes for a comfortable wear in general. However, in this case it doesn't really matter - this hat is a complete joke and a waste of money. I do not recommend this product to anyone - not even to anyone I hate!"
5,Great,The product speaks for itself and was well received. One size fits all so make sure your measurements fall within the guidelines or else the fit will be off.
3,Ho-Hum,"This particular map didn't live up to my expectations. I guess I'd call it nice. The green watercolor wash obliterated much of the finer detail I was expecting and there wasn't much captioning. From reading other reviews, I'm guessing other maps in this series are much better."
2,A special relationship,"D Kennedy seems to have a penchant for writing about unlikeable people. In this story the female lead comes over as a spoilt aggressive journalist, and the male lead as a complete moron who'd found himself in a situation he'd never wanted and then craftily manipulated his way out of it. He deserted a person who could have been a good partner, and rewarded a woman who was complicit in thieving his affections and a child not her own. No heroes in this story.. the mother gets her child back, her ""primordial"" right, but then has it playing happily in a pen while she writes...this actually dosn't happen, a child wants your full time attention at all times, so either you put it in daycare, or wait till its asleep..... this leaves me wondering yet again why people are so careless about contraception...."
2,"Way too much detail, didn't keep my attention","I read all the reviews and they certainly caught my attention. The book sounded just like what I love to dig into; a perfect rainy day novel. I loved the story line, the charaters were well developed, the scenarios clear and I immediately bonded with Sally. It wasn't until she went to the hospital to deliver baby Jack that the author belabored (no pun intended here) all the boring details and strung out Sally's hourly symptoms and emotions ad naseum. I began skipping sentences and speeding ahead, hoping to get on with their lives at home, but the depressing writing just wouldn't stop. I found myself dreading picking up my Kindle because I knew my good mood would soon turn sour. I finally gave up and deleted the rest of the book as I no longer cared what happened to them. So disappointed................And surprised I am the first reviewer to give it less than multiple stars."
3,"Have a rainy day? I was looking for a different book, same title.","I was looking for a book where a girl talks to a ghost from the 1800s, but they were killed by being stuck in an old elevator in a snow storm.This book had good story telling and the plot kept me interested, but the habits of the ghost were very girly. My step daughter (12) said ""its weird"" and I found the actions of the ghost when relating to the living childish and lacking substance. The mystery side was good enough that I kept reading, even though it wasn't the book I was hoping it to be. I'm male, 34 years old."
4,Good Replica,"This gun looks real on the account it does not have an orange tip at the end of the barrel, which is a plus. Blued finish means black, you will get a black gun not the silver one like you see in the picture; false advertising. Never knew fake guns can be greasy."
4,"Barbie ""Cute"" but that's About It!!!","I bought this walkman (over my better judgement to buy a Sony) after my daughter begged for one like her friend. It is Barbie pink and therefore adorable. However, it is cheaply made (thin breakable plastic) and I fear it will not last more than a few months (if that!). Something of this quality, without the Barbie name, would sell for half the price. I don't regret the sale, however, because my daughter was thrilled to see it under the Xmas tree."
4,"JOEL, JOEL, JOEL...","You're young. VERRRRY young (I saw your list, babe!!) Listen again!! There are some great pop songs on this CD. Actually, I used ""So The Story Goes"" as an audition piece and snagged several singing jobs including a concert tour in Asia singing back up for the #1 pop star in Japan. Also the re-mix of that song contained help from the great Bobby Womack. Joel, you might say 'Bobby who?'. Another great song is the ballad ""From Beginning To End"". See, I'm very careful & discriminating when I give my critiques on others work (I'm mean, you actually like J-Lo's voice - Duh!!). Too many people who don't truly know music have all this negative rhetoric to share. If you can't say something good...The only reason I'm contributing this is Joel's unfair, unaware review. Something must be done:-)By the way: This CD, while not a culmination of all classics, is a very good collection of 80's pop. Very similar to ABC and Go West (loosely, in this case) If that's your ire, check it out!!!"
2,don't waste your time,"I got an anti-glare screen protector directly from Boxwave in Nov, because of a glowing review on the internet. Within a couple months it had developed a rough spot where the stylus spells out the characters. I didn't write the company until recently, but the answer was that they guarantee it for 100 days, & so I wasn't covered since it has been about 130 days.It is now difficult to even enter characters. Don't waste your time, as they are fairly expensive."
2,poor quality and covers many worst goals,It doesn't cover the greatest goals but focus on some important games.It should be titled the greatest soccer games in World cup
2,authentic dialects?,"While the actor who read each instructive monologue was talented, he has some weak points, (White South African was too close to Australian). The only ""authentic"" voice was russian. Also, each dialect could have been applied to the same text, rather than applying to culturally specific topics. Then, differences in pronunciation, emphasis, would be more evident."
3,Fun card game with some structural flaws,"This is a very good game. Simple, easy to learn and capable of customizing rules. The letters do not have a very good quality, they are made in a very thin paper for the type of interaction that the game requires."
2,Really a shame,"The story in this book is quite intriguing, but seriously, did nobody look at the text? Font changes, size changes, entire paragraphs indented from both sides, hyphenated words mid sentence. It is a true disservice to this author that this one got away from him without someone proofing it for Kindle. It was free, else I'd be asking for a refund."
4,"Imaginative, Entertaining, And Original Thriller","Here is a ""time travel"" adventure without time travel as the hero relives the past through visions of ancestral memories. A good plot, interesting characters, and well-written. My only reason for not giving this five stars was that it becomes a bit overlong. This book could have said and done all it had and still been had 80% less verbose. The author is recommended to all readers. I liked some of his other books a little bit better - especially ""Shadow Box."" You can count on John R Maxim for a good read every time out."
1,Kindle Edition is a Mess!!!!!!!!,This review is for the kindle version of the book. The formatting of the text is all messed up. Words split in mid-sentence and continue on next page and paragraphs have all different tabs. Save yourself the $10 and pick up a used paperback copy.
1,Bad Kindle edition,"I realize this was a free book but Amazon needs to pull this edition until it can be published as the author intended. In its present from it does nobody a service. Jumbled words, changing text. Kind of frustating."
3,"Others have done it much, much better","Without question, the best mix of time-travel and love for both the city and the people in it is Jack Finney's Time and Again. Time and Again is the book Maxim wished he had written. Every page of Time Out of Mind reminded me of how each situation was better handled and more interesting in Finney's book and it's sequel.Certainly there are differences between Maxim and Finney, but its clear who Maxim read while thinking about his book. Time Out of Mind is ok, but instead of having to time travel back and stop yourself from potentially wasting valuable time, grab some of Maxim's other books... and while you are at it, grab a copy of Finney's Time and Again."
1,Unreadable,"The Kindle edition editing is so bad I didn't get farther than the second page. Even for free, this was not worth the effort."
1,Disappointed reader,"I waited for years for Mr Maxim's books to be converted to ebooks. I even emailed Mr Maxim about it two years ago as I am disabled and cannot read dead tree books. Imagine my excitement when I saw all of Mr Maxim's titles availble for my Kindle...but it quickly turned to disappointment when I found, like another reviewer has mentioned, that the formatting was atrocious; there was no cover art or TOC; and the books (I've checked 2) are filled with missing words and spelling errors. They are essentially unreadable.I have emailed Mr Maxim to make him aware of this. One can only hope he, or his publisher, will correct the problems and issue a revised version soon. Until then do not purchase these ebooks."
2,"edit, edit, edit","As others have said, this Kindle edition is a mess. Font size is either tiny or huge with no in between. Hyphenated words are everywhere - and they are not words that should be hyphenated. Paragraph formats are screwed up, etc. VERY distracting!The story line is good, not as good as his last novel, but interesting if you can get past the print problems. It does drag here and there. This book really needs a good editor to condense the story.Had I paid $10 for this, I'd be seeking a refund just for the horrible formating problems. I got it for free, so I guess I can't complain.My advice? Skip this one!"
2,Wish I would have read the Reviews!,"Can't believe Amazon would even carry this kindle edition! The formatting, punctuation, and spelling were atrocious. But what made reading very challenging was that words sporadically would lack complete syallables. I think I figured out most of them but it sure made for a mystery of a mystery!"
5,Beautifully written and illustrated,"This is a charming, humorous and educational book. The language is appropriate for the intended audience and the illustrations are beautiful. Especially nice was the introduction of a female as conductor (in a male dominated profession), the fact that the book is based on a real conductor and the interactive question and answer exercise, as well as the lesson in conducting. A book that will educate as well as entertain."
1,Do not buy,First of all the charge cord for mine needed to be put only halfway in or it would not make contact. Then the battery never charged. I took it apart and found the connection to the battery fell off. They didn't even solder it they just used some sort of weak glue for all the connections.I mean ALL of the connections were weak. When I soldered one another fell off until I soldered all of the connections. It was actually brand new in the box too.
3,Excellent as a Historical Text Book,"So, I expected this book to be a bit more fun. Unfortunately, the fun element is missing. However, in fairness, the book serves as a thorough textbook for the history of American Cinema and its techniques and various genres. I did enjoy reading about the early studio system and the vast amount of control this oligopoly held. There were some very good critiques and studies of specific films, and a bit about specific actors and actresses. Even a bit about directors. Though packed with information, the book just lacks an entertainment value that it could and should have pulled off based on the subject matter.The different genres studied include:WesternsWar MoviesSilent FilmsFilm NoireScrewball ComediesAs well as an overall dissertation on Classical Hollywood Style and its various techniques."
4,Good read; very informative...,Now that I've read this book I now view movies differently. In more detail and I enjoy films even more.
5,"A Nice, Thorough History of American Cinema","John Belton's ""American Cinema/American Culture"" gives a nice thorough history of, you guessed, American cinema and its relationship with American culture. I was required to buy this book for a Film History class taken as part of a film minor requirement, and it was one of the better textbooks I was required to read. It gives a nice run-down of film from the invention of early film/camera technology, through the early Edison years and chronicles the rise and fall of the old Hollywood studio system before delving into the prominent styles and themes of American cinema in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, touching on ways film styles influenced and were influenced by American culture during each era. If you have to read a film textbook, or if you even read such things for pleasure, I think you'll find this book to be a great choice."
3,book is all over the place,"This text gives details about the history and important transition of the film industry over the century, but it does shift around frequently going off on every tangent possible for a while and then coming back to the original topic that by the time it shifts back you were under the assumption it was completed.As a general read it is decent, but as a text where note taking is necessary the constant shift is annoying."
1,not for me,"I was forced to read this book `American Cinematic/American Culture' for my American Cinema class. This book could not hold my interest. I became bored, lethargic and eventually sleepy. American Cinematic/American Culture is for the `history buffs,' in other words it is for individuals who are passionate about history. They have studied history extensively and have an expertise in a particular era or subject. My professor seems to come alive by engaging the class with colorful tones, along with his animated presentations adds life to these characters and its era. This has assisted me in viewing history in a different perspective, positively. By no means am I a lover of history but, I am more knowledgeable regarding some of the major events and how it plays a vital role in our society. To keep me engaged, however, I would rather be enlightened by my professor who keeps me salivating for more, rather than learning it from a book-without colorful characters."
4,text book,This book was in good shape when I recieved it and was what I needed for a class. It took a little longer to get to me than I anticipated but I paid for snail mail so...
3,"small ""s"" sacraments","This is an easy-to-read devotional book (Catholic) that helps the reader link daily life to the sacraments. Kathy Coffey describes these moments as small ""s"" sacraments. She talks about her own personal experiences in finding those moments in the midst of a busy schedule. The chapters are short and sweet so I found it comfortable to read at night before going to bed. I did not relate to most of the stories, however, because she speaks from the perspective of a mature homemaker. This is a great book for the right person."
1,Unstable,Bought it and returned it within 24 hours. When the joystick is in 'neutral' it kind of sends random signals to the computer so that while I was flying Falcon 4 my F-16 would wobble around. Very annyoing. Also it's not a very precise sitck. I bought a Microsoft Sidewinder Precision Pro. Same price. Extremely precise and stable. Cheesy looking but great. By that one instead.
1,PC only means PC only!,"Ignore the MacAddict article that appears on the item description page. It is referring to the USB version of this item, which is not what Amazon is selling here. This has some sort of PC-only gameport connector."
3,Good historical coloring book for Ancient Greece,"I know from our college students that Rome is far better known than Greece. This coloring book is excellent not only for the coloring you can do, but also because it uses primary images and includes some information about the legend, the person, or the original object with each other. The focus isn't on the historical period but really more on the mythological and religous context of Ancient Greece so I wouldn't recommend it as a ""history"" book. Neither the illustrations or the text creators are given credit so I have to take off one star."
2,Not satisfied at all!!,"I bought this book based on the great reviews it received. I made it through half of the book and had to stop. My biggest complaint is they fail to include results in their clients portfolio's after 1999.They are big fans of equity investing (of course they work for a big brokerage). In one of their stories, they berate a former advisor of one of their newer clients for having them in bonds. Not that the percentage overall was too high. But, that the advisor had them in bonds. Well, the authors didn't mentioned where the client sits today with the heavy equity position the authors put them into.Being financial advisors (brokers) for UBS Paine Webber is no different from being a broker at Morgan Stanley, ML, or Smith Barney.I found this to be a waste of my money. I thought Suze Ormans books were far better than this book. A lot more honest too."
1,Shameful attempt at self-promotion,"This book is nothing but a thick marketing brochure. It discusses the basics of financial planning, but it incorporates the authors' own subjective analysis and opinions, which, based on their reasoning, often times borderlines dangerous. It leaves unrealistic expectations on the readers with no real academic backing and no real insight or intelligent commentary. Rather a lot of ignorant comments, hypocritical recommendation, and poor order of discussion. I feel by reading this book, you may actually becomer dumber than had you read nothing at all. The authors clearly designed this book to be a celebration of self-promotion.Normally, I give books away when I'm done with them, but I would be insulting whoever received this by doing so - so into the garbage it goes! Please don't waste your money on this one - you're far better off with books by Burton Malkiel, William Bernstein, Larry Swedroe, Jonathan Clements, Thomas Stanley."
1,[i-mode Crash Course],"This just might be the worst technical book I own. There is some useful material in it, but it is so poorly written that t's hard to tell. There are non-sentences, some sentences that are impossible to understand even after re-reading, non-sequitirs, and more typos than I have seen in any other book. The text repeatedly says things like, ""At present (as of this writing)"", without telling you when that is -- and the data given will be at odds with data just a few pages away, which begins with the same disclaimer. The text is also highly repetitive -- how many times do I have to be told that cHTML is just like HTML? The material on WAP is internally inconsistent, and, from what I can tell, outright wrong in places. Many of the pictures appear to be low-resolution images.... I feel the publisher should have had someone redraw pie charts so that the fonts are legible. ... There must be a better one on the topic."
1,A definitive No-No,"As it was one of the first i-mode books available, I didn't expect much - and that's what I got. It seems very unstructured and often provides redundant and inconsistent information.Sometimes it's better to take some time and not to be the first."
5,The future is now - get on board...,..or get left behind. John Vacca in this book brings a revolutionary wireless application and puts it right at our doorstep. It is up to us as what to do with it.John Vacca's book seems to cover everthing that is known about I-Mode and he even looks into his crystal ball of future I-Mode technology as only he can do.I-Mode has conquered Japan and now marches right at us. Read John Vacca's through and complete book and you will be ready battle tested and ready to join in the battle.
5,Love it so far,I am a volunteer my self at the my cities animal shelter. And I am going to let the president of the volunteers borrow it after I am done. I hope they make more about volunteering.
5,Find meaning in your life and change the world,"Read this book to celebrate humanity. The stories inspire usall to offer our gifts to others.Bob Parks' story ""You Got Another One, Joey"" moved me toexamine denied prejudices in my life.Charlene Baldridge's story ""Beyond the Huddle,"" showed menot to pass up opportunities to make a difference and Pooja Krishna's,""Forgive Me Davey,"" gave me a chilling look at what may happen if I turn away.I highly recommend this book for a look at how we can change the world one deed at a time."
4,"Intriguing Story, Beautiful and Different Art","This first volume of Model set the mood of the settings and characters that we get to enjoy more in the volumes to come. I was particularly impressed with the story at first, but it did make me curious and hinted at spoilers to come. It is worth reading this and the other two volumes currently released because the story gets even better and the art becomes adicting with it's airy and open lyricism. If you enjoy romance or gothic manga, I recommend this Korean manhwa to you. You won't regret buying it."
1,Boring and predictable,"Or mayby I'm just angry at the blatant plagarism. Anyone who has read BronZe by Minami Ozaki will tell you that. The character artwork is very similar. Michael is a direct rip off of Koji Nanjo. The hair, the nails, the lipstick, the way he poses, everything. Even the cover art screams BronZe. Unfortunetly BronZe and its prequel 'Zetsuai since 1986', in the western world, has only been released in French, German and Spanish(in which i thank my lucky stars I'm fluent in). Believe me, once you have read Bronze nothing else can compare. At least not in the yaoi/shoujo section."
4,Catching but hard to follow,"I borrowed this book from my best friend before she even had the chance to open it. After reading it, all I wanted was to get my hands on the second book as quickly as possible. It gave me manga fever!The artwork is divine, I throughly enjoyed it. However, I think the author sometimes gets ahead of themself. There are... leaps... in the book, holes. Where two characters will be talking together and then all of a sudden on the next page it will be a completely new character in a new situation. A couple of times I had to re-read the same pages about five times to understand what happened. That's why I took a star off, otherwise I would have given it a full five.Overall, the characters are likeable and the story is believeable. Sometimes, though, I mistake the woman and the man with one another. Hehe. No, c'mon... he's cute..."
3,Good sound and lots of fun to dance to.,"When I was flexible, we would dance all night. This would be play at least ten times to get feets to the floor."
2,I only care for two songs on the CD but its worth it...,"I've always love Funkin' For Jamaica as one of my favorite dance songs. However, this and Fungi Mamma are the only reasons for this CD but they are great dance anthems."
3,informative but laborious,"the information and research that went into making this text make it a very valuable resource for historians, artists, and students interested in the history of the significance of numbers in western philosophy. i myself am using it to understand the importance of numbers in sacred western architecture -- i want to do a performance art piece based on ""the name of the rose"" by umberto eco, and he gives a great deal of attention to the significance of numbers in the structures of the abbey in which the narrative is set (4 towers, 3 levels, etc). anyway, the info itself is great, and the explinations are clear, but the discussion isn't particularly passionate and it can be very difficult to get through some sections, because the language is often dry. i understand that history is not always like watching fireworks, but really... so as a research tool this is a valuable book. as an interesting read, it doesn't score so well."
3,Rusted within a month of use during the winter,"Maybe this is a fluke, but within a month of use in cold winter weather, the lock began rusting. Without the key, it is extremely difficult to slam the shackle down into the socket. This is the first time I've been disappointed with a Master Lock product. I don't know how it rusted so quickly without regular use."
5,Refreshing and Useful Guide to Disneyworld and Disneyland,"Not only have I bought this book for my own use but for gifts for all the people I know who are going with and without children to Disney. The book gives insight into the various attractions, helping one to know what is age appropriate and what you should definitely see (especially for first time goers). The hotel and restaurant critiques are great! What I loved the most was that while reading a well written Guide, you smiled and laughed all along the way.The book is great for all ages !"
2,Not Worth it,"arrived fast, but not worth it. the book was not filled with any new facts. It was not the ideal book for any one attending disneyland our california adventure."
2,If Ross the Intern was a Tourguide...,"This is NOT the ""Ultimate"" GLBT guide to Disney Parks. If you're a twink, or a party boy, or a circuit guy, then maybe this will work for you, but the content is very basic and out of date (2007), and the ongoing bitchy parenthetical comments are, at best, annoying. If you are a more mature gay man or woman, looking for inciteful comments about art or fine dining (I don't consider gorge yourself buffets in this category), or advice (beyond where to cruise, make out, or get drunk), that might make your vacation more enjoyable, look elsewhere. This has all the substance of a ""Ross the Intern"" segment from the Tonight Show, with ""humor"" that reads like schtick that was too immature to make it into late-season Will and Grace. If a straight guy ever read this, it would only confirm all of the negative stereotypes about the gay community that we are tyring so hard to overcome. I purchased the e-version of this book, and will probably just deleat it."
2,Gaying around Disney,Much of what is in this book is not particularly original. Every book on the market in reference to Disney Parks offers a much better summary. I used this book on a recent trip to DisneyWorld and didn't find it useful.
4,Ridiculously Addicting,"If you liked Advance Wars on Gameboy Advance, then you'll love it on the DS. Same addicting gameplay now with wireless multiplayer with one or two cartridges thanks to the DS and its wifi. The only thing keeping it from getting 5 stars is that there isn't much of a difference between this and the older games except that now you can see stats or a map on the upper screen instead of having to press start or whatever. Also there are now touch screen controls, but i find them to be harder to use accurately than just the d-pad.For those of you who have never played an Advance Wars game it's kinda what you'd get if you combined Final Fantasy Tactics with Age of the Empires and Starcraft... Kinda. So try it out if you into that kind of stuff, you'll waste hours of your life guaranteed."
1,the same thing over and over again,"amazing, people will buy anything. with the exception of 2 screens. this is the same thing as aw1 and aw2."
4,"Great Hitch For A Second Bke, Or For A DIY Trailer",Great 'second bike' hitch if you have ruzer products. I bought it for a couple of DIY trailers. Woks great.
2,Not built for Longevity...,I have had this joystick for only a year. It is now not able to be calibrated! It no longer remains stable. I recommend spending the extra money for a really good joystick.
5,Use on your Human Hair Lace Wigs,"This is a gentle hair shampoo that works really well on your human hair lace wigs. It detangles well as long as you comb out prior and shampoo with care. If you do not know how to wash your human hair lace wigs go to YouTube and look up how to wash your lace wig. Remember to pat extra water out of your wig by placing on a towel and covering using the getting the extra oil off your pizza method and then spray with the detangler put a little moisturer in it and let air dry completely, turn inside out use a hair knot and tape sealer let that dry. Style . . . since I have been using this method my wigs are lasting longer."
4,Good,Installs like all other tints I've used before. Follow the instructions and you'll be fine. It's been almost a year and the edges have not peeled up yet. So far so good!
2,Boring,I'm very disappointed in this book. His previous book An Arrow's Flight was pure brilliance and this is pure boredom. Very disappointing.
2,Final epitaph,"The video truly shows the horror of gang violence. But thats about it. I only shows the aftermath of an incident where the EMS pick up the body. It doesn't go into colors, specific gang cultures or gang languages/signs."
1,An Abomination,"I've never seen a bigger load of crap than this before. This author has no spritual sense at all. He wrote about some low-life 16-year-old kid is supposed to be the ""key"" to storming the Gates of Heaven. First of all the Gates of Heaven would be guarded better than anything else and it is. Second of all JESUS CHRIST is the only key to Heaven. And also this man can't possibly claim to be a ""Christian"" if he writes about the Gates of Heaven being stormed and he also uses quotes from some evil Heavy-Metal rock bands. Parents I strongly suggest you don't allow your children read this if you want them to keep on the right path. That's all I have to say."
4,Christian Science Fiction,"Alot of times I see books labled Christian Science Fiction just because there are Angels in it. I feel in this case the label fit. When reading this book you are moving realm to realm with time on earth not changing. For me I do always get a little lost, I perfer my battles being fought right here on earth. That being said I did struggle through this book a little because of it but not because the story was bad.I read a review about the teenagers dialog sounding strange but I thought it was spot on. Three siblings fighting with their own Gaurdian Angels and not all on the same side! As I finished this book I was very excited to start the second book in this Trilogy!"
5,Cheers for War in Heaven,I found War in Heaven a very good read. It was refreshing to have a fantasy novel basedin Christian principals. The same goes for The Wrath of Angels and World in Shadow the other twobooks in the series. I hope the series can be continued with the three heros as adults.
4,Good Stuff,"This book has great character developement and an amazing feel that pulls you in. Christopher a 16 year old, finds his temptations not in the natural, but in the supernatural. The struggles we all faced at that age come glaring at you in fantasy. It reminds us there is a supernatural evil, and that the temptations we face in life are from the evil one. As St.Paul said we struggle not against flesh and blood.......Get it!"
1,Not pleased at all,It was not at all what i wanted and it didnt come with all things that it was supposed to.. i will probably never shop on here again..
5,One of the Best from the 80's,"The first TT album as a trio consisting of Tom Bailey, Alannah Currie and Jo Leeway. Without doubt one of the best examples of joyful synth pop from the early 80's. Many described the Thompson Twins as highly contrived at the time, but really who cares if the music is good? And the music was great. I can only describe this as the most flexible and bouncing pop you will ever hear. Infused with a great sense of fun and drama, every tracks delivers something. If you want to listen to one TT album, this is definitely the one. Highlights include Love Lies Bleeding, Lies and We Are Detectives. And yes, the original cassette issued included an additional album of remixes - we would LOVE a re-issue of this on CD!"
5,"Really a shame this is so many $$, need a domestic version!","This is the best Thompson Twins album by far. The music is dancable, pop but left of center in a way that no other band could do.Arista would do well to release this and Into the Gap with the remixes that came on the cassette versions.Sidekicks has some really great new wave tunes like We Are Detective, Lies and Love on your side.This is really an essential album show casing what was good about the early 80s, a band willing to make pop music but also willing to do it in a creative way.The best ballad the band ever did was ""If you Were Here"" which you may recall being featured at the end of 16 Candles."
4,Great balance of theory and practice,"I used this text for a class in health care management. I was impressed by the readability of the text, the incredible amount of information it contained, and the great balance of theory with practical approaches. Many books about management are a bit short in the area of practical tools. This one gives you tools to work with. I used the outline of this book to do a strategic analysis of an organization with which I work. The only significant weakness of the book is the uneven quality of the case studies. These were contributed by outside authors. Some of these are terrific, others are not well written and not so helpful. Hope this gets corrected in the new edition."
5,Excellent book,"I would highly recommend this book. It is easy to read, methodical in approach and provides a balance of relevant theory and application. A useful resource for any healthcare organization expanding its services within existin country or beyond.Thanks extended to the authors...I look forward to other additions!!!"
4,Very complete and well balanced,"This book is an excellent introduction at leading strategic work in the health industry. Too many organisations, especially in the health care sector, go about their daily work without any kind of formalised strategic process. Unfortunately in today's changing environment, this is not enough. This book will show you how to initiate and lead a strategic review or strategic plan development for your health care organisation. The process followed is clear and grounded in real strategy development. There are also a lot of very useful real life examples."
5,Cute and Nicely made!,Our daughter got this for a gift for Christmas last year. It has a nice variety of beads. Our daughter hasn't played much with the beads but all her friends that come over have enjoyed them. She loves the chest with the little drawers and stuffs little objects in them often. I would recommend. The colors are girly and vivid. The chest is thick and sturdy. She was 4.5 when she received it and still enjoys it at five. This is a toy that we won't just toss out. A child will use it as the grow for various reasons.
1,Not worth the money for an adult!,"I bought this book to gain a better understanding of bugs and insects in the US, first the book is not limited to the US, second there are no maps for quick identification of the insects population areas in the book, and third the coverage is very superficial and does not detail the beneficial and detremintal aspects of the insects identified. I would return the book if it wasn't worth the cost of return."
3,Beetles,I found this awkward to use. I still have not identified the beetle that has invaded our home. I have also ordered another insect book which has not yet arrived.
3,attractive but incomplete,"This book is very attractively presented with many glossy pictures. However, coming from the Smithsonian, I expected more. I tried to look up a couple of insects based on their caterpillars, but to no avail. I finally found them simply by using Google. I would have probably preferred purchasing a more comprehensive book"
4,Looking To Put Your Music Notes,"This book assumes you learn to play an instrument without learnning to read music notation. It tries to match the note with the sound, and test you to see if you know the notes. You take each test using the CD. In order to use the CD correctly The author recommends a CD player that ""searches tracks"", not a CD that shows ""time remaining"". You can use a ""time remaining CD to synchronize but it's not easy."
1,NO,"Let me put it succinctly:1) ANYBODY who can read music could have written this.2) Many people who can read music HAVE published books about how to read music: there are MANY better alternatives available.3) Much of what this particular book tells you is WRONG.Here is ONE much better alternative: The ABC OF MUSIC: A SHORT PRACTICAL GUIDE TO THE BASICS by Imogen Holst.So what part of ""NO"" don't you understand?"
3,Fun game,"This is a very fun game, but this version is cheaply made, for the price of it. I might revise the rules a bit to make it easier."
1,Stay away from all Endless Games Titles,"Okay, these games are cheap but that does not excuse how bad they are. For Xmas my wife bought me two titles from endless games (family feud and deluxe encore). Both are horrible. It seems as if the people at endless games have skimped on everything possible to keep the game as cheap to produce as possible. The instructions appear to be written by a 13 year old.I would not recommend either of these to anyone and would instead spend a few extra bucks to get a game that has some thought behind it."
1,Not quite as fun as I thought,If you are not familiar with the song - how can you determine if its actually a legitimate one the other player is singing?
4,game night fun!,This is a good time! I took one star away just because it's hard to convince your friends to play it! LOL
4,"Great game, depending who you play with","The premis for this game is intruiging and fun -- to be able to come up with a song that has lyrics that use words identified by the game.The reason I gave the game 4 stars, however, is that I had an awful experience the first time I played the game. Here's the scoop...the group I played with included my father-in-law (a country music singer) and young brother-in-law (a rap fan). They repeatedly claimed and sang songs and tunes I had never heard of. I'm not saying that any cheating went on, but I was so far out of the loop about the songs they were choosing that there was no way to tell who was winning and who was losing. Well, OK, I was losing.This can be a fun game if played with your musical peers. It can be a major disaster otherwise.I hope this insight helps someone out there."
5,Great Game,I purchased this as a gift for my brother and sister and they loved it. They are big music fans!
5,Love it!,This has been a favorite game of mine for years. I've played it with many friends and they always love it. It's great with a big group of people too. I'm glad to see it's available again.
2,Fun...for about 20 minutes,"This game starts out promising, but one thing is that in it's current rules state it is just too hard to finish. If you're not playing this game with a bunch of music teachers, then it wears out pretty quickly. It has the potential to be a lot of fun but it's a few minor tweaks from being a good game. It seemed a little disorganized, and we ended up just going back and forth between 2 teams trying to come up with songs (basically making up our own rules along the way). It's definitely better when you have a large group of people, as opposed to 4 or 6."
4,Great Fun!!!,"Just played this game for the first time last night, and had a lot of fun! Of course, it helps that our group kept coming up with Broadway and Disney selections, and we covered a wide range of styles and decades. One thing I will recommend: don't be afraid to use the timer! The only downside is that if you get a group with a lot of musical knowledge the game could go on for a long time, UNLESS you use the timer, which is explained in the rules. Great game for a party!"
4,"Fun!!! But...""Deluxe???""","I love this game. It's as fun as everyone else says.Just don't be fooled by the ""Deluxe"" title. Anyone who customarily buys deluxe versions of games will be confused when they open the box. It's just a cardboard playing board, standard markers, pair of dice, hourglass timer, and a deck of cards. Nothing wrong with that of course. I just wish they hadn't said ""Deluxe.""Added 7.14.12: I've come back to this review years later and noticed that this product is no longer titled ""Deluxe."" Much more accurate. Thanks!"
2,Thought it would be more fun!,Encore seemed a lot more fun online. It was a Christmas disappointment all around. It didn't last very long and a lot of the questions didn't seem to have anything to do with the category. I think I will buy all my Christmas games at actual stores so I can really get a look before buying. Mary
4,Fun Game,"This game is great. Especially for groups. It makes you remember the lyrics to songs so if your good at that, this is the game for you. Its a blast."
3,Not like it used to be!,"I really enjoyed playing the original version of this ""board"" game. That is, when it had a board. Although the concept is the same, I think that it's really lost alot with this new stripped down model."
2,I would not recommend it,"First of all the movie is less than an hour long. $25 is just too much to pay for such a short film. Secondly, a lot of it is not even good, and the stuff that is good they show over and over again. The worst part of the movie is when they make fun of how people look. The commentator is not funny at all, and this part of the movie is completely lame.There are not too many soccer DVDs, but whatever you do, stay away from this one."
5,Good Little Book,"For a short history and with wonderful pictures, it is a great little book, it tells you basic things you may wish to know. If you want great indebt, then look elsewhere."
5,Simply Brilliant,Neil Diamonds Twelve Songs Album is equal to his best.If you loved Hot August Nights youll love this.Its a much more matured outlook on life with love and wisdom to burn.Straight talk'n and beautifully mastered a must for all Diamonds fans.Thankyou Mr Diamond for showing the way once again.
3,old time listner,Just okay for me. A little redundant after all these years. A lot of his music is beginning to run together and not real standouts. He loves his music; I'll give him that. I own most of it!
3,Very good Greatest,"This is a very solid, good greatest-hits-CD of this fine italian group. It was made 1998 and has a good sound. In style, I would say (on this song selection), for me (perhaps only for me) theres is a feeling of mixed Dixie Dregs, Spock's beard and Eros Ramazotti. Well, as a compilation, it varies more than an individual album. But all in all, it's light, poppy, catchy pop/rock with many interesting complex sound patterns (prog-rock, if you like). There is no metal music nor metal vocals here. But they sing italian, of course. This is a very enjoyable listen for me, and as a compilation a good overview with good sound quality. Please check out the other reviewer opinions, as they are very informative and helpful especially concerning PFMs individual albums, which sure are worth a look!"
2,wrong item,wrong items sent to me would like a phome number to talk to someone before sending them back or someone to contact me as soon as possible thank you cindy brothers
3,Did I buy this?,"If I bought this, I must have been drunk. But, it's probably a good book if you're into fixing broken aircraft engines."
3,Gun Belt Cartridges,"The product was real looking and very resonable, but they were to small for my cartrige belt. These are about 32 cal. and my belt required 45 cal."
4,Nice addition,"I recently purchased a replica revolver with functioning parts for a Halloween costume, making these dummy bullets a great finishing touch. They shipped very quickly. They're very well made and are heavier than I expected, which was nice. The only qualm I could muster is that the pictured set is silver, while what I got are gold, but that's fine by me, anyway.When my girlfriend asked why in the world I bought fake bullets, I told her, ""Why, for my fake gun, of course!"" A great addition!"
1,Poor Looking Shells,I was very dissapointed with my purchase as the bullets look nothing like 45 cal. bullets should. The gun deserves much better looking bullets. There is no reason these cannot look more authentic even at a higher price which I believe people would pay.
3,They are just OK,The dummy cartridges slide right through the holes in the holster. I will need to put tape or something around them to make them stay in the holser. They need to be bigger to work well.
3,They Fit,"They defiantly fit in the Denix SSA pistol.They are solid metal and have a good feel.They are a little small, so they rattle around a bit, and short so you have to really look down the cylinder to see them."
1,Dead weight in your backpack!,"I recently went to Paris and this guide was just dead weight in my backpack. The organization (I use this term loosely) is awful. The metro map has errors and the maps of Paris in the book are simply unusable. Thank goodness the hotel that I stayed at provided maps of Paris for free in the rooms (and the hotel that I ended up at was NOT in the book even though it was lovely, clean, secure, and a cheap place to stay). I thought that was odd because it was not a tiny hole in the wall, I know they can't list everything but let's get real here! If I had owned this book rather than borrowed it from a friend I would have tossed in the trash on my first day there."
1,Don't Buy This Product!,"I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas and immediately the mircrophone stopped working. In January, the CD Player stopped working and now here we are in February and the electrical cord isn't working well (we can only use cassettes & the radio). Toys R Us and the manufacturer refuse to exchange or refund us. Money down the drain!"
2,"Do not purchase March 11, 2002","We purchased the Barbie boombox for our four year old daughter. The microphone does not work. CD player skipped, now it no longer works, only able to listen to radio or cassette player. Speakers are also very poor quality unable to turn up volume to high or the music is distorted. This product is very overpriced."
1,Extreme Disappointment,"My daughter loves to sing, so we thought this would be a perfect present. The microphone, however, is of such poor quality that you cannot hear the singer through the speakers. There is no way to control the microphone volume, so when you turn up the volume to hear the singer better, the background music just gets louder. Also, the CD player skips badly. What a piece of junk. We returned it the next day. One other item-- the songs on the CD were not what I would call wholesome for your young daughter to be singing. This is yet one more disappointment in the junky Barbie line from Walkie Talkies and ovens to pagers."
2,OVERPRISED AND POOR QUALITY,"SANTA BROUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHER LAST CHRISTMAS AND IT DIDN'T LAST 2 MONTHS. THE CORD SEEMS TO HAVE A SHORT, THEN THE CD PLAYER STARTED SKIPPING THEN QUIT ALL TOGETHER NOW THE ONLY PART THAT WORKS IS THE RADIO AND THE TAPE PLAYER,THAT IS WHEN YOU CAN KEEP THE CORD WORKING."
4,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT,"AFTER PUTTING TOGETHER A COMPLETE BARBIE ENSEMBLE FOR MY DAUGHTERS CHRITMAS GIFT, THIS WAS THE ONLY PRODUCT THAT SHE REALLY ADORED BUT COULD NOT USE AFTER A FEW MINUTES. APPARENTLY THE CORD HAS A SHORT AS WELL AS THE MIC WHICH WENT IN AND OUT AT TIMES ENABLING YOU TO HEAR HER VOICE CLEARLY ONLY AT CERTAIN POINTS. AFTER TRYING TO REPLACE IT AT THE TOY STORE THEY TOLD ME THAT THE OTHER ONE THAT THEY HAD IN STOCK WAS ALSO DEFECTED. TALK ABOUT A DISAPPOINTMENT. AT THIS TIME I THINK I HAVE GIVEN UP ON BARBIE PRODUCTS. FROM THE RECALL ON THE BARBIE JEEP, TO THE FLOP IN THE NON WORKING BARBIE PC I PURCHASED AND THEN NOW THIS. I THINK I WILL STICK TO THE DOLLS FROM NOW ON."
2,AB10156 X-Trail Review,"I just recieved the ab10156 yesterday, bought them off of a friend for $10.00 and a weaker set, so $15.00 total.Today I read some of the reviews posted, First, these do have tripod mount, you have to unscrew the plastic cover in the front center to see mount threaded hole. Second I see I am not the only one having double vision, something that only accoured with the cheaper less powerful pair ( make unknown ) when lenses spread to far apart. Third, I went to a lesser overall viewing circle with the ab101s than I had with the unkown pair, but for $15.00 I'll try to be happy although I liked the weaker unknowns better."
1,Barska 20x50,"This product is only for those who have to see thing very very far. Its a lie that it helps at games, too close. It carries no zoom adjustment. Only purchase if you have to see things that are very very far away. It is good for that."
4,Great product,Great product for the price. I signed up for the Amazon rewards card and basicly got it for free. I love it.
3,Good item for the price,"For the price the optics are clear/colored well. However the lack of a tripod insert makes the 20 power lens difficult to keep steady in my hands, already lost the caps, my fault, at least the strap holds it to my neck."
2,So overated,I usually do not feel mislead by reviews but this is one of the few. This is very mediocre cocoa powder but nothing mediocre about the premium price. Not the worst thing I have had but will never get it again.
2,DISAPPOINTED,I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. CHOCOLATE FLAVOR VERY VERY MILD AND I HAD TO ADD MORE CHOCOLATE TO MAKE IT PALATABLE. . THE RASPBERRY FLAVOR WAS OKAY.
3,Very good cocoa mix but delivery was not,"The hot ccocoa mix was very good!!. I packaged them with a mug as a favor and it was a big hit. However, I was very disappointed that 3 out of 5 boxes were missing cocoa packets. There were 16 packets in total and that there missing. Amazon customer service was helpful but since it was close to my deadline I had to go out and purchase more packets that were not of the same kind. All worked out."
2,Chalky Chocolate Truffle,I purchased the product for a Christmas gift and assumed that coming from Bellagio it would be perfect. The person I gave it to tried one packet and gave the rest away. She said it smelled great but tasted chalky and wouldn't drink any more of it.
1,Funny taste,Flavor was not what I expected. Prefer Land O'Lakes which has a more robust and traditional flavor. Will try other varieties.
3,Meh,"I use hot chocolate packets to stir into my coffee. I normally use Land O'Lakes hot chocolate, but I've had trouble getting some of my favorite flavors, so I wanted to try something new. I ordered the Bellagio Chocolate Truffle flavor, and I suppose that it gets the job done. But to make my coffee taste chocolatey enough, I've been having to mix in the Bellagio cocoa with a K-cup hot chocolate. The flavor's a little flat, and the texture is pretty watery when compared to Land O'Lakes or even regular Swiss Miss. I don't hate it, but there are better options out there, so I won't be ordering it again."
3,Too shetchy,"A real disappointment. The story is sketchy, some of the characters one-dimensional and unmotivated. The nasty air of menace and evil that we associate with the McCarthy Era is well-evoked. But I'm never made to feel anything for the characters, which is too bad because lines between good and evil, and right and wrong are made so clear, so black and white.We never really learn why sopme of the major characters do or feel anything they do or feel. The right-wing columnist and the black playwright are especially flat characters. Racism, sexism, homophobia, anti-Communism: these are big topics that people have deep conflicts about, and there's not enough deep conflict within the characters in 'Shimmer.' People are who they seem to be and that's it."
2,I suggest you quit reading at page 20.,"I wanted to quit reading this book early on, but I kept thinking it would get better. It didn't. The characters are artificial and disconnected, there is no particular storyline, the time frames jump all over. Perhaps the most annoying thing about the book is all the whining! Black, Jewish, Irish, lesbian...every stereotypical character, whine, whine whine!Lousy."
2,Saved By The Pecks,"1313: Haunted Frat is another David Decoteau peck fest. All the male actors in the film are shirtless at some point, and most of them are seen in their underwear or in the shower. And that's where the good news ends. This is definitely not one of Decoteau's best. The first fifteen minutes consists of a guy in his underwear walking slowly throughout a house. Very slowly. Glacially slow. And the film only runs 75 minutes, and still is too long just because of that opening 15 minutes that bored me to tears. And the ending is so abrupt that I said ""Huh"" when it was over. I was thinking that I had missed something, so I rewound it a bit. But no. That was how Haunted Frat ended, rendering the whole movie pointless. Well, of course expect for the pecks."
1,And I Thought Reviewers were too critical!,"...I can't believe that I decided to ignore the two ""one star"" ratings, as I thought that the film would at least be up to his ""Brotherhood"" films. Was I ever mistaken! The first NINETEEN (19 - yes NINETEEN) minutes consisted primarily of one guy walking around in his white briefs through the house - no dialogue - just music. If you find that interesting, the rest of the film might be worth watching. On the other hand, a short Youtube video has more plot, more dialogue, and more sensuality. Though the other reviewers had commented on the abrupt ending, I was not prepared for how abrupt and senseless it really was - it was as if the director had suddenly run out of money or time and just had to end the film. At least I just rented the film from Amazon, and only threw away the $3.99 rental fee."
1,An awful movie,"Can I put 0 stars down? This was pretty bad. No, not pretty bad. Really bad. I should have read a book."
3,Only OK,"I choose this rating because I found the film to be less then I thought it would be. The action was little. Most of the time was spent watching the ""ghost"" rub her hands over the nearly nude bodies of the guys and they spent a lot of time in the shower doing the same thing, rubbing their bodies, but never using soap...amazing."
1,1313 beyond bad,"ok, this guy makes Uwe Boll seem like Steven Speilberg. I mean David should really be charged with crimes against cinema. I do not get how this guy make money, no one likes his stuff, oh sorry, mean no one who is not his friends who make fake reviews on how good his stuff is. He should really stop making crap and let some real filmakers with actual talent thru."
1,Bent upon arrival,Getting a curtain extender compatible with my Kirsch rod was a failure. The extender did not have the same profile and it came dented in 2 locations with a mere piece or corrugated cardboard to protect it during shipment.
5,Delightful and Imaginative Designs,"Miniature Iron-On Transfer Patterns for Dollhouses, Dolls and Small Projects is full of imaginative, playful designs for tiny rugs, curtains and bedspreads that will enhance any dollhouse. In addition, the patterns can be applied to many other projects: I have used the delicate baby animal motifs to embellish baby clothes and the many attractive decorative borders are ideal for embroidering collars, belts, bookmarks, and table linen. The transfers are easy to work with. The designs can be used by needleworkers of all skill levels."
4,A useful book for Operations Research Students,"This book is useful for students who participate in O.R., it gives a clear, basic concept of the subject. I recommend it if you are interested in OR, though some examples in the books are tedious. Mitchell is well known in O.R. field, he contributes his lecture in the London School of Economics. Visit him if you wants to explore more about the book and you are in London."
2,disappointed,"These are NOT the same as sold as JCPenney and other department stores. They are shorter, they do not come as high up on the calf. Very misleading. I thought I was buying the same Gold Toes sold in department stores, but that is NOT the case."
1,gold toe socks,"Have always purchased gold toe socks. Although listed as my size, these socks were made with less material - they were not as tall going up the calf and did not stay up like they used to. I compared these to ""older"" gold toe socks and these were definitely made with less material and not as good. Seems to be a ""cost cutting effort"" on the manufacturer??? Will not buy them again."
2,too much fuzz,"these socks are okay, but after one wash, they were covered with so much fuzz and didnt look good. so the next pair i washed it with hand and dried alone to avoid the fuzz. also they are too warm socks."
2,"Too heavy, too long.","I bought this to use with with my hitch mount bike rack to clear the tire I carried on the back gte of my Jeep. It is way too long, incredibly heavy and lets the bike rack dangle all over the place. I am using it for the wrong application, it's not good as bike racks extension."
4,Good locks,"Perhaps a little stronger than the average lock (Master calls them ""Contractor Grade""). However, I think a good pair of bolt cutters would have no problem with them. It is nice that they are keyed alike. A good value if less than $20."
3,THEY DO THE JOB AND THE PRICE IS RIGHT,"These are not the best master locks but they do the job. I have found the machining on these locks to be a little rough. They are sometimes hard to close and, once closed, they sometimes fail to lock and fall open. Maybe once they are used a little more they will ""wear-in"" and perform better. Price is a good feature."
3,Slightly Unbelievable but Good,"How is it that mom, dad and their 4 grown sons, living in different parts of the country and world, can all get together, leave their jobs and homes and go to Iran on vacation? All at the same time! To me, that was a stretch too good to be true but made the story better. Money for this adventure was not an object either. The story was good, the purpose was clear, but the Hassan story could have been told in a third the pages. The bulk of the book is Iranian history and geography, which was very well done but could have been a separate travel book. The bond with the servants was touching and the memories touching."
4,A Fascinating Journey,"The Ward Family's almost quixotic journey back to Iran to find their former housekeeper is the background to what, in many respects, is a primer on Iranian history. For me, the actual search for Hassan was a subtext to the more interesting historical and religious insights offered by the author into Islam, Iranian history and culture. At times, the book is a bit unbalanced, and anti-Western in sentiment. But, I recommend it to anyone who (like me) knows very little about Iran and its history and culture."
5,Amazing book,"This is an Amazing book. I read it four times. I have learned a lots of things about my culture that I didn't know before. You learn all about history, culture and current events in Iran at the same time. we are going to read this book in Persian Club of my high school, which I preside. you will enjoy reading this book."
5,Searching for Hassan,"This book is exciting, entertaining and engaging. Terance Ward shared his and his family journeyback to Iran in the 90's in search of their Iranian family. Details of history, customs, Iranianhospitality and an overland journey make this an exciting book.My family knew the Wards and we were living in Masjid-i-Suliman and Tehran at the same time they were. Itwas fulfilling to read this historical memoir."
3,cute book,"i bought this to read to my young daughter who was having trouble with some friends in preschool. i wouldn't say this book was a miracle or anything, but it's still a cute little story. i guess it's a good way to bring up the topic of what to do if other kids aren't being nice."
5,C`est Bon Tea,"This tea is very tasty ,c`est bon and very energetic ,it`s almost like mood elevating and relaxing it`s a very social drink."
1,Boring.,"This weak science fiction book is a sequel to ""Massacre in the Twenty-second Century."" Originally, no author was listed for this book. However, I later discovered that it was written by David Hagberg, who later became known for a number of spy novels. Unfortunately, he did not have a knack for science fiction or space opera. This was boring."
2,too boring,"I bought this to send to Europe for a cousin to teach English to her children. Very obviously for hispanic audience, not generic enough. As a foreign language teacher of 20+ years (French, Spanish, Italian and ESL) I did not find this at all engaging for young children. To tell them to sing by themselves at the end of every segment without any cues is totally useless. Very disappointing. I would not have bought it had I been able to preview it."
4,Don't blame the amp if it isn't loud!,"When I first set this up on the E.drum set I was really.. really disappointed. It was simply not loud enough. I had already ordered a new drum brain as I was not happy with the current one...New drum brain.... AMP WAS KICKING. I had to throttle it back to keep the windows from shaking. This is the perfect match for a good electronic drum set. I play at home with my sons and there is no doubt you can hear the drums over my guitar and my other son's bass.This won't go to ""11"". But for home use ""4"" may be just enough!"
1,Beyond horrible,"This reivew is from a Chomskyan perspective, as it well should be, because Gitlin seems to be motivated, at a rather petty level, by his hatred for Chomsky. This is an arrogant, shallow, stupid, and presumptuous book, with absolutely no genuine insight revealed whatsoever beyond the banal. Instead of taking on important issues like racism and the Middle East, he settles scores with Black Panthers and allegedly anti-Semitism in the pro-Palestinian movement. Gitlin is no leftist-he's wedded to establishment, Democratic party politics. Events since he wrote this book have discredited that view, obviously. People like Gitlin have made their peace with the status quo, and are left to try to dress up banality as profundity. There is literally nothing to be gained from reading this book, other than an understanding of the difference between the genuine radical left and self-absorbed blowhards like Gitlin."
5,All the other consoles have 'serious' games. This one is the one if you want pure fun.,"This is my first game console that I intend to keep but it should say before you buy or on the box you need a memory card (any size) or every time you start a new game, you'll have to start from the beginning! Love it however! Another small thing, it does use a fan that you can here if nothing is on (all my devices don't have fans so I'm not used to hearing a box) but not an issue while your engrossed in a game!I've played Mario Kart Double and Mario 7. I like them both. For less than $200 us dollars you can get a console, four controllers with two extension cords, two small memory modules, three games (two used - one didn't work - argh). I got the Mario Party 7 with console - two controllers. Then went and got two controllers with extensions and small memory card for $13 each. Then two more used games (beware as I said) Great value! P.S. I'm sure I bought the last one available in Clarksville IN yesterday."
4,Fun for kids,"I'm no game expert. My son wanted this for Christmas, because a friend of his has one. I was happier getting it as a game console than the more expensive game consoles (although I didn't see what was wrong with just using PC games), because the Nintendo games seem more oriented to kids. On watching the kids play the included games, I'm surprised both at how simplistic they seem, and how much fun the kids have had with them. You need to buy a separate proprietary memory card if you want to save game settings and so forth. One thing that seems odd about this machine it that the picture seems fuzzy."
5,Great for Casual Gamer,"This bundle was a stellar deal in December 2005 when it sold for $99.99 new.Overall, I picked up a GameCube for casual gaming to play multi-player games with a non-gamer. It is a good replacement for board games. I bought it to play games like Mario Party 7 and it has been great. I already owned an XBox since 2001, but bought the GameCube in 2005 since it was really cheap and the simple games on it that aren't available elsewhere. It has been fun as a secondary system. I still prefer my Xbox for all other games than the multi-player games, but for the price, it is fun to pick up some of the GameCube games."
2,Not much has changed,I expected more out of nintendo. This game is just like mario party 6 except bowser is more obnoxious than ever! You spend a lot more time waiting for it to be your turn which means the game takes a lot more time to play. I am very disappointed with this game.
4,Great book for Italian cooks or canning food enthusiasts,"I saw Eleanora on Martha Stewart and eventually (perhaps a year or two later) decided to order her book. Sadly it was out of print, but thanks to Amazon I found a great distributor. This book is well worth any price you pay. Eleanora makes such interesting dishes in ways that work for home cooks. I love canning foods, and she has great tips for sauces and other delightful ways to can tomatoes, etc. Her recipes are authentic. There are few if any books that truly reflect the home-cooked Italian heritage...regardless of the region it reflects. I love this book, and Eleanora has a delightful voice throughout the entire book."
5,The Wild Muir: 22 of John Muir's Greatest Adventures,We love the stories that take you to John's Adventures...and the Sierra's
5,A wonderful collection of John Muir's adventures.,"There is no better way to know John Muir than to be engrossed in his wilderness adventures. Lee Stetson, whose wonderful portrayal of Muir to thousands of people throughout the world, deftly picks 22 of Muir's grandest experiences in nature. It instantly takes us into Muir's heart and soul, his youthful love of wilderness, and his unique ability to tell us a story that both delights as well as educates us to the importance of the natural world."
5,Great book!,"John Muir is fascinating! This book really describes his adventures in detail!I am amazed at the stamina and will of john Muir to go where he went and to do what he did, WOW!. Just to hike around Yosemite in the winter is amazing enough, but J.M. also climbed mountains and trees and frozen waterfalls,ect. He did all this and more back when there was not any modern climbing gear or extra warm cloths or power bars, or camel backs, ect!! He truley was a one of a kind mountaineer!!"
5,Ankerberg and Weldon are telling the truth,"In the past, I had first hand involvement in alternative medicine. Until this book was written, a good research of the subject had not been done, at least to my knowledge. When the Lord began to open my eyes to the falseness of alternative medicine and the spiritual danger that can develop from participating in these New Age practices, research material was at a minimum. I thank God that these two men wrote this book. It has helped me so much. Thank you."
3,"Content great, shape of book not so great","Book came with musty smell and some type of ""spotting"" on ""edges"" of pages (seen when book is closed). Hoping it is not mold. Didn't see any other flaws however."
5,My Favorite Book,"Dragonfly Qigong is now my favorite book on the topic of Taiji Ruler and Taiji Ball. Dr. Steward has taken these ancient exercises and incorporated new modern tools that will enhance your Qi instantly. This book is packed with great photos and very easy to understand instructions. Energy cultivation has never been more fun! Bill Zimmerman-Seattle, Washington USA"
5,A Book That Actually Delivers,"If you are a beginner or an experienced practitioner of the arts, I highly recommend that you give this book a serious look. I very seldom recommend books, but this one works. I've personally experienced the benefits. I've also seen people from the different arts try exercises from this book in public and seen for themselves that this book delivers. You've never experienced the feeling of chi flowing through your body? Try this book. You will see results for yourselves within the first or second day of practice. Nothing comes without effort, but with a sincere try with this book you'll stir your chi."
3,Weather War,The book was in okay condition (yellowed pages) considering how old it is. It was what I expected although I hoped for better. Can't really complain for the price of shipping only.
5,Cardone 40-387 Remanufactured Domestic Wiper Motor,This was the perfect fit for my 1992 Dodge Spirit. It is still working well on this car. We are happy with the product and recommed it.
4,Very good.,"Over all very good. I wish there were more clips from games where these moves are made. Maybe several for each move. Also, it would be nice if they had the move from an overhead angle. I would very much recommend this, but not to anyone who plays in the Newton Indoor Sports over 35 league and is not on FC Brookline."
4,read this!,"This DVD is usefulll and great to learn in chunks. I suggest people that are novice or intermediate players watch it. Once you have learned the moves shown, the DVD is not of much of a use. While learning the moves however, it is a great reference. I think it was worth the cost and can tell it has made a difference in my skill of play."
2,Better for older kids,"Bought this for my 7 year-old thinking it would show some basic skills. Unfortunately, the skills shown are for older (12 and up)and more experienced players."
3,So So,"Reasonable review of various moves, but some of the demonstrations were much too basic, and did not show the deception needed to make the moves work. If fact, some of the ""cut"" moves looked very lazy in the demonstration. My youth team was not very impressed. A few more demonstraions by either professional players or in-game shots would have been very helpful in showing how to ""sell"" the moves. I think this is ok for youth coaches, but not for the players themselves."
2,"Full of smoke confused ""facts""","The moment I saw the statue of Jesus holding a lit joint, I knew that I had to buy this book at Powell's Books in Portland. Unfortunately it was all down hill from there. I guess I was hoping for a travel essay that covered the laws and pot culture in each country he visited or maybe real history of the plant. Instead you get lines like ""It is well established fact that man discovered fire in order to get stoned"". Might have helped my reading of this book if I had been stoned."
4,Best game this year.,"This game is all around great,except for a couple of flaws.I't should have a better trade option,rookies should have been rated a little higher,speed should have been a little faster. Over all this game is graphicaly the best.Also player contact is always a plus and the post moves are awesome.NOW WE NEED NCAA INSIDE DRIVE!"
5,GREAT GAME!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you liked NBA Inside Drive 2003, then you will love this one because it is the same thing just revamped and with a lot of new things and options. Get this game if you are a fan of the Inside Drive series, you have nothing to worry about!!!! Although the only thing that pisses me off is that you can't get young Michael Jordan in secret players and i dont know who the secret players are because i can find the codes for them!!!!! SO IT'S A GREAT GAME, JUST GET IT IF YOU LOVE INSIDE DRIVE!!!!!!!!!!! IT'S THE BEST NBA GAME OUT THERE!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,executive1029,If you are into updated rosters and the latest and greatest then this game is not for you. If you love to play games that are simple to understand and easy to play then this is your game! Graphics are horrible by today's standards but I still love it.
2,Uhhhhhhhhhhh.............OOOOOOOKKKKK............,"Yeah, so as i was saying, this game is strange. I'm just going to lay out my review as a Pro/Con review.ProsGreat graphicsCreate a player is awesomeYou can play up to 25 seasons!Cons.Everything falls into this category.How they shoot is aweful.Sometimes, the music and sound effects will just stop for a short while.A.I sucks!The all-star difficulty seems easier then the veteran difficulty.THe ref takes about 10 seconds to tip the fall off at the beginning.WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYY TOO MANY FOULS!!!!!THe half time report randomly picks someone from the team and says how good they are!?!?!?!?!THis game is maybe worth $10, MAXIMUM!"
2,Has everything... just lacking in the 'fun' factor,"This game has great graphics, pretty good gameplay, terrific statistics, great franchise/season capabilities, etc..., but for various reasons, it's just not that fun to play. For one thing, the broadcasting is pretty lame. They are pretty repetetive, and the things they say aren't that cool. Furthermore, the court sound is focused on sneaker-squeaking rather than a good solid ball-bouncing, which makes it all even more tiresome. I put together an exciting rookie-focused team with LeBron, Melo, Darko, Yao and T-Mac, and it should be a game I feel like playing a lot, yet I can't stomach the thought of wasting another 45 minutes on playing another game."
2,lies in the title,"Allright, so I bought this a couple months ago and I was not too pleased with the 'noise cancelling'part. I wanted some headphones that would drown out all the noise so that I could mow my lawn without having to listen at such a high volume. I was also surprised that there was an on/off switch to activate the 'noise cancelling' circuitry. I put them on, turned them on without having music playing and it all sounded exactly the same, no noise cancellation at all. Later when I turned them on WHILE listening to music, I realized all it did was make the sound louder. I came to realize its not 'noise cancelling' circuitry that got me excited about this product, but it was just circuitry that makes it louder. Other than that, these headphones are Okay. I don't really like the feel of them over long periods of time. I would honestly not recommend this to any of my friends or family."
5,Fantastic light and flexible running shoe.,I use a bunch of athletic shoes and I find that Asics Gel Nimbus is the pair I pick most of the time. These are light and incredibly 'springy' shoes that provide the right amount of cushion. These are much superior in my opinion to NB and Saucony.The price is the one thing I am not happy about but all manufacturers are the same in terms of pricing for specialized shoes.
1,Synthesized symphony,"Beware these vocal versions set to synthesized music. Thin and tinny, they are not arranged interestingly or differently from the originals. Stick with the widely available collections of the original versions."
2,Everything is Lip Synched,"While the picture and sound quality are very good, every so called live performance is lip synched. There are a bunch of promos for the biggest of Kinks fans. I'd say skip your money on this one. I'd love to see some early Kinks in actual performance."
3,Kinks Kollekted '64-'83,"Big Kinks fan. But after purchasing the HolliesDVD, I can only gather the Kinks package had littleof the group's input, as a great number of the performances were lip-synched, inferior quality anda disappointment to me. The color performances were fine, but there were no interviews or overview of the group, something the Hollies, as always, was of high quality and given a great deal of thought."
5,You won't regret,"Sela Ward is one of the finest actresses Hollywood has ever had and this book is a must-read for everyone who loves her. It expresses her beautiful personality, and perfectly describes what it means to be born and live in the South. If you love her, you'll love this book too. Just a humble opinion from a European fan.."
3,Okay for trivets,"These trivets are just okay for me. They are cute, and cast iron, but I have to ding the review of them because I had to glue the feet onto them. When they arrived their packaging box looked like George Washington carried it across the Delaware River, and when I opened the box it was amazing that none of those little feet were missing due to the condition of the box. Someone just threw 4 heavy trivets into one tiny little box and thought the box would withstand. Weird since any other time every single little thing I order from here arrives in it's own box."
5,Looks wonderful!,I was looking for spiral objects to match other close-by items - this turned out to be perfect and perfectly functional. it also arrived fairly quickly.
2,Very basic without good research into the subject matter,"This book was a surprise based on the excellence of the others in the Howdunit series. Usually these books provide well researched and accurate information for criminal fiction authors. This particular book, however, seems to focus only on what the author(s) were able to glean from other writing books, and contains many mis-statements and incorrect information. A far superior book in this series is Malicious Intent, which covers everything that Modus Operandi does, but in a clearer and more accurate form."
3,CSI tells more,"This is a very basic book written by 2 detectives. It seems a bit dated to me (1995) and doesn't seem very writer-oriented either. While there is a wealth of material (from a detective's perspective), most of it was already known to me from watching TV & reading. While it could be used as a reference for writers, I don't think it would be much help in actually writing a mystery or detective novel or story. One would be better off IMHO reading some of the great mystery writers (e.g. Christie, Marsh) and current ones (e.g. Marcia Muller, Grafton). However, I did enjoy reading it--it's a very easy read."
3,Well done but short in duration,I wish I would've read the first review about the duration. I was just getting tuned up and the video was over. I wish the Video Length was a standard field for the titles. I think paying 20$ for 100 minutes is a better value than paying 10$ for 30minutes. Now I have to buy the second video...
2,Mask has visibility issues,"The costume came on time, it looked like it was supposed to and was easy to put on. The velcro for the hood had to be sewed back on, but it laundered very well. The mask, however, proved a bit dangerous at night... hard to see out of. Should have realized that from the picture!"
3,Halloween costume,It worked out fine for my son. He was happy with the costume.I would recommend it to others. Thank you.
3,Cool Ghoul,"My grandson wanted to be a ghost for Halloween and this was one of the costumes that had more to it than just a white sheet. It did run big, but it was easy for me to cut the length and sleeves and duplicate the ragged look at the ends. He didn't like wearing the hood -- but that is probably because he is only 3. But he still was the cutest ghost around. (3 years old - size small)"
3,halloween/play costume,it arrived in great time and was exactly how its picture the chain that goes along with it is so short or tiny you can't even get it around a small child's waist etc... so it doesn't have a purpose whatsoever... but other then that it was good
1,sound problems; difficult to use,"Unfortunately I bought this product in a store before reading the on-line reviews. I experienced the same audio-problems reported by many other people: a loud buzzing background noise in the outgoing audio when using Skype. This rendered the product useless for me since I purchased it for making Skype calls (there is a big ""Skype certified"" logo on the box). I also think it's quite complicated to use. Although I got it to work by following the instructions step-by-step I think it's too easy to make a mistake in the sequence of ""click here, then press the button on the headset for a specific amount of time, then press it again after the unit beeps, then click that button in the Bluetooth window, ..."" etc. that one is supposed to go through before the device is ready to use. Perhaps after a while one gets used to it. The main flaw of this bluetooth combo is the sound quality."
1,Don't waste your time or money -- it really sucks.,"In spite of the bad reviews, I thought I would give it a try for myself. I have a brand new top quality HP computer. Hook up was easy, but sound quality really is very poor. Don't waste your time or money."
1,Don't buy this product.,"Do not buy this product for VOIP applications (Skype, GoogleTalk, YahooVoice.) The buzzing noise will drive you and the receiver of your calls crazy. Multiple attempts to resolve the issue and a replacement unit have not resolved the problem. Tech support acts like they've never heared of a complaint like this --- Ha! You can see from the reviews that it is a persistent problem."
2,I really did not like it!,"It is better in the picture, I did not like it at all, the quality is not so good and it is huge!"
2,jason,its ok wished it was made a lil better not very durable fabric def not high quality costume in my opinion
5,Enjoy learn Struts?... with this book you are in the Glory,"Explain all details about Struts, easy to understand and to apply in real proyects."
5,A revision would benefit from...,Full-page size blueprints with dimensions & close ups of all the X-15 markings. (For scratch-built modeling purposes). Love the photos and the pilots first hand accounts of the flights that held surprises.I own quite a number of aviation books and is by far my favorite (along with the companion scrapbook). An excellent job!
5,A Must Have Book on the X-15 Research Program,"Dennis R. Jenkins and Tony R. Landis have produced the best volume I've ever seen on the history of the X-15. A fantastic collection of information on all aspects of the research program including hundreds of color and black-and-white photographs, many of which I'd never seen before.Dennis R. Jenkins has been doing a terrific job with his book on the development of The National Space Transportation System, SPACE SHUTTLE. HYPERSONIC is a must have for every space library. I can't wait to get a copy of X-15 PHOTO DIARY by the same authors, a collection of several hundred photos that didn't fit in this book."
3,Bernie Williams Mcfarlane.,"Bernie Williams is one of the few of the remaining yankees of there 1996-2003 run to the world series.He has a chance to make the hall of fame. Mcfarlane has capitalized on his popularity with fans and his fellow teamates. Bernie is sculpted in his away uniform chasing down a pop fly in the center feild grass. He is painted with the 100th anniversary yankee logo on his hat and left shoulder, with dirt on his right leg. This is a must have for yankee fans or anybody who loves Bernie Williams."
4,Advice,"The product is very well made and of high quality. I purchased it to try and remedy a trouble with a trailer that was too short for my boat. It did not help the swaying, in fact, made it worse. No fault of this product! A weekend and a welder and the problem is solved."
4,Listenable Sorabji,"In my opinion , this is one of Sorabji's more listener - friendly pieces , especially the langorous Villa Tasca movement . Another great Altarus release of this fascinating and puzzling composer's long and complex piano works."
2,Too Many Gimmicks,"Links 2004 has way too many goofy special effects. Also, the game is not challenging enough. You can pretty much just fire away at will and get a low score. The graphics were cool at first, but I quickly lost interest with all the gimicks. I wish they would bring Golden Tee to the xbox."
1,What can I say..Microsoft has proven it again...,"You've proven that you are only out for a buck and could careless about putting out a quality product. It is amazing that the Links franchise could go from one of the greatest golf games of all times in Links 2001(PC) to what is the worst golf game since the days of the regular NES system. There is no control on this game whatsoever, chipping is a joke, and the putting is the worst system I have ever seen. You are in no control of what goes on. The player simply hits buttons and hopes for the best on this game. It's so depressing, the mighty Links franchise has fallen and fallen hard. Trust a real golfer folks, if you want realism, get Tiger Woods 2004 for any system. Even if you are given this game, return it immediately, your health will appreciate it. As I said, Microsoft proves every time it releases something that they could careless about quality(for those of us who have to run Windows SUXP you know what I mean)."
1,Microsoft are a bunch of idiots.,"This game has bugs that will eat your stats and unlocked equipment, take your money away, and force you to do things you have allready done if you are unlucky enough to come across a save bug like both me AND my brother did. My Stats just got reset but his player got tottally screwed and had all his stats reverted to a much earlier state and no longer wants to play the game and neither do I. Futher proof that the people at microsoft are a bunch of idiots."
5,One of my favorite golf games for the consoles,"Yep, I'm one of those people that likes Links 2004 better than the Tiger Woods games. Thats not to say that I don't like the Tiger Woods games at all but I think that on the Xbox, Links is the way to go. I prefer the sim approach as opposed to Tigers more arcade style although I think both are great games. I really like the graphics in Links as well as the sound effects and music. Links also has online play which is fun but I have actually spent most of my time building up the stats of my created guy. You can also download several courses over Xbox live although I have yet to do that so I can't say if they are worth it or not. Overall, both series have their pros and cons, however Links 2004 is one golf game that will entertain you for quite a while."
5,Where to purchase replacement score pads?,"This is a great game, but it has one problem! We have yet been able to find out how to order or where to buy score pads? Everywhere we have looked you must buy the whole game to get more score pads!"
5,Finally found it!!,I've been playing Kismet since I was a kid. I tried to find score sheets only to find out they don't make the game anymore. I made my own and am still playing. Kudos to Endless Games for reviving a classic and old favorite!
5,Lots of fun to play!,"This game is like Yahtzee, but different! It was a fun change for a favorite game of mine. I enjoyed it as much as I like Yahtzee."
5,So Much Fun!,"I played this game as a kid, then it simply ""dissapeared"" off the shelves. now, 20 years later, here it is again! basically the same as Yahtzee, but with colored dice. The moves become tricker when you must color match the dice as well. Definatly worth buying!"
3,Fun for awhile,"Game is ok, but the cup is too small to get a good shake of the dice, if you like yathzee, you'll like this game."
3,Spotty Quality,"I ordered three of these lights last year for grow lamps and liked them so much that I decided to order three more. The first one I put up worked for a couple of days and then quit. The second one is still working after a week. I would return the first one, but it would probably cost more to send it back than it is worth. Had I been able to buy this item at a local store all I would have had to do was take it back for an exchange. That is one of the drawbacks to online shopping!"
2,"Nice lights, but trip gfci",I bought a number of these lites from a local store to use in the basement and garage. They work well except on a GFCI circuit breaker. They trip the GFCI when they have two bulbs installed. Worked fine on a non-GFCI breaker circuit.
2,Happy Guy is right,"This product doesn't last very long, and the ballast isn't replaceable. Nor is there a replaceable starter. It is quiet and easy to install though."
4,work OK,got 3 of them all work fine - why a black wire with white body is beyond me - but once you get over that all is OK
4,GE GTD 120.. turns off,"Offers great sound, but has one annoying little feature. If you lose power, or even inadvertantly hit the button, an auto turn off comes on. this means that if you have it on Aux 1 to listen to the tv only, it shuts off every 30-45 seconds. It took us a while to figure this out, as it's in the fine print in the manual. You cannot listen to tv in complete home theater, but it will let you use the front, and center to offer a stereo sound. Overall, a great bargain. Not expensive, either, we paid a mere $45 on sale."
5,Love this book,I think this is one of the best books I've read to my daycare children. There is not many children's books that you want to tell everyone about. I was telling people that I had read the funniest book today. The first thing I did when I was done reading it was find out if the author has other books. This would make a great gift too!
3,Alright for a budget lens...,"I'm a relative newbie to the photography world and received this lens as a gift shortly after purchasing my digital SLR camera (Canon Rebel XTi). On the whole the lens is a so-so lens, especially for the price and wide focal range. The image quality is okay and the color is okay... I usually end up boosting the contrast and color a bit in photoshop, but it's decent enough. At the longer end (300mm) the bokeh is nice and good for amateur portraits. I did notice some chromatic aberration in some shots though...It's handy to have the wide focal range... though it's a bit heavy, focuses a little slow, and is a bit loud when focusing.However, if you're a newbie, and want to have a lens that will give you more options than the Canon SLR kit lenses (14-55), this may be a good starter option, especially b/c it's so inexpensive. If you have a bigger budget and can afford something more, I'd save for a Canon lens. Better build and image quality."
2,heavy and slow,"This lens is very heavy. But it's not its major drawback. It's slow. Very slow. I had a canon 75-300 III (basic EF w/o IS), and it is at least 2 times faster than this Quantaray lens.Will work for you if you shoot stable objects with your camera on tripod.5 stars for the price, 0 for the speed and quality --> 2 stars."
4,great compilation of traditional Mexican songs,"Most of these songs are fairly old and I love them- great versions of most of them. There is at least one contemporary song on here, too (Lila Down's La Linea). There are a couple songs on here that I don't like so much, but for a whole album that's not to bad. Fun to sing along with! Orale!"
2,"Too basic for Braillists, too difficult for beginners","This is a book of just the basic contractions and rules. It is not a dictionary of print-text and their braille equivalents (other than the standard contractions and short-form words).There is a section of print-text to braille in alphabetic order, and one of braille to print-text in cell ""order"". The rules relating to each word or symbol are placed right by the word or symbol, and this is the best thing about the book.A beginner is not going to learn braille from this book; it is a handy, small reference for those who already know the rules and just need a quick refresher on usage."
4,Excellent reference book,I am a para professional in a high school working with visually impaired and blind students. This book is an excellent reference book when preparing materials for these students. There are so many rules in braille and sometimes it's hard to remember them all - especially if they're not used often.
3,would have been much better with makaveli aka tupac,"let me start off by sayin that this cd isnt bad. its just that the two groups have totaly different flow styles. thug life is the ghetto type of huslin flow, and outlaws is the war (...) the two dont go well togethher. it just felt like sumthin was missn. that sumthin was pac. pac would have been the balance on this since he has both type of flows. pac is the mediater. anyway this cd is pretty descent, but if your expecting it to sound like sumthin 2pac had his hands on your mistaken. and goin to be dissapointed. big syke is the exec. producer on this so beware. buy only if u like hardcore rap and or like the outlaws or thug life with the absence of pac"
3,Good for a Foo Fan.,I always enjoy an acoustic performance from any band I like. Foo Fighters did a great job of adapting their songs or what some like to call stripped down versions...or in this case skin and bones. You'll like it. Considering getting the dvd.
4,Who wants to Rock!,The Foo Fighters are one of my top five bands. I have all of their cds and dvds. The Foo Fighters even have their own special playlist in my ipod because they rock! This dvd is awesome. I have watched it over and over again and can not get sick of it.
3,"Good, but could have been better.","This is a good live, acoustic album but it could have been better. I always think that Nirvana's ""Live in New York"" is the standard-bearer for these types of albums and this doesn't come close. That being said this is still an enjoyable album full of good music. I would've liked to have heard it possible in a more intimate venue and stripped-down even more."
3,It doesn't rock!,"OK, I love the Foo Fighters, They're my favorite band to see live. This is an acoustic album...somehow I missed that in the item description. I like it a lot, it hits you in a different way than the normal rockin blarin Foo Fighters that I love. But it hits you none the less..."
1,"Please, wake up, full screen edition (1:33) it's over",I don't understand how yet exist new releases in 1:33 Aspect Ratio. Most of TV's are widescreen so I don't understand this.
4,another very good album,"Good album, not sure if it's a favorite yet since I haven't listened to it enough. But I did download the entire album onto my nano when with most albums I pick and chose."
5,Very Nice for the price.,Placed these on my 2003 Road King. Very easy installation. Total time around ten minutes. Gave my bike the added bling I was looking for in the mid frame section.
5,unbelievable,"This is absolutely the best chocolate I've ever had. I used to get it periodically at a Dutch import store near me, but I went there today and they didn't have any. Naturally I was inspired to check Amazon and write this review.Let's just say any time I go to Europe, I come home with this in my suitcase."
2,Just alright...,The game has fairly good cartoonish graphics for the time it was made. The voice acting is clique but serves its purpose for the game style. Plenty of war materials to get anyone happy. The biggest issue is the controls. They are hard to get use to and some what clumsy. It didn't feel natural to move and conduct basic movements and commands. After a while I got tired of it and simply put the game down. I don't any intention of ever playing it again. Just not worth the time.
4,Fun But Hard!!!,"This Game Can Be Fun; But They Should Have Taken Out Any/All Time Limits And Protection Missions. And They Should Have Added Factories To Make Your Troops. Your Troops Die Way Too Easy When Your Not In Direct Control Of Them And Do Almost No Damage Alone. Even Against What Their Good Against Their Weak. Unless In A Group Or You Have Superior Numbers You Can't Hold Out Long. And Even Then You Almost Never Get Backup. Your Also Started With The Weakest Stuff Against Rediculous Odds Most Of The Time. But Other Then That Some Missions Have Artillery And/Or Jets And Bombers And Battleships (A Land Based Huge Tank). I Had Lodes Of Fun Though, Once I Figured Out How To Get The Leg Up On The Enemy, So Have Fun With It Like I Did!?!"
5,Battalion Wars,"This is one of the most enjoyable games that I have purchased for the Gamecube. If you are a fan of real time strategy games, I highly recommend Battalion Wars."
2,Fun for a little while...,"I generally expect a very high quality from Nintendo games, so maybe this will be a bit unfair, but I had several complaints with this game.1. The controls are clunky. Instead of moving the character and using the targeting reticle secondarily, the character follows the targeting reticle at all times. Often you end up pointing straight up to the sky or straight down to the ground during the heat of battle.2. It's difficult to control your army. You cannot control portions of your army to attack different things. A positive example would be Pikmin. BW allows you to either control one character at a time or all characters of a particular type, but nothing in between.3. Making war seem cute and kid friendly, plus pitting grossly stereotypical countries (US, Russia, East Asia, and Eastern Europe) in diametric opposition to each other seems less than educational for my children."
1,A waste of time,"Do not waste your time on this Book. Fisk had an interesting life as a journalist in the Middle East; unfortunately, he is woefully inadequate at telling the story. First, regardless of the title, this is not a history but rather a rambling memoir that is hopelessly chaotic in structure. Fisk would have benefitted greatly from a heavy editing to cut the length down to 400 pages or there about. Second, Fisk clearly dislikes ALL government leaders from all countries and is unrelenting in his criticisms and second-guessing of policies and actions. For those who enjoy basing the USA you will find Fisk a kindred soul, as he reserves his strongest venom for the USA. These criticisms would be interesting if he presented viable alternative solutions. He does not. He castigates everyone except for his favorite hero, himself."
3,"Incredible writing, but biased on TOO LONG","This book is clearly a monumental achievement, but as others have pointed out, Fisk has a clear bias (which I tend to side with). My biggest issue was the extreme length of this book, it seems to meander in places for dozens of pages with nothing substantial to say, and frankly I found most of his observations to be uninformative."
5,An amazing read!,"A very informative book! A must read for anyone interested in the history of this important region. Some reviewers would have us believe that historical facts are biased, they exist independent of politics. To anyone who is serious about reading factual and a trully objective analysis of the how and why the middle east is as it is should buy and read this book."
3,Overrated,"The guy has lived in Lebanon for three decades, interviewed many such bad guys as bin Laden and Nasrallah. Bin Laden once even tried to recruit him as one of them, according to the author himself. It's fair to say that he's sort of brainwashed and his heart isn't in the right place anymore from the Western point of view.The book offers a narrative of his decades of personal journey in the Middle East. I learned things new to me in the first third and some later chapters, but I certainly disagree with his negative tone throughout the book.Overall the book's way too lengthy, it's too much rambling of a personal nature, biased and unbalanced, without much substance in history and objective analysis. Imagine sitting in the library reading old newspaper articles filed by him for the past three decades. He's a journalist after all, not a historian."
1,Another British anti-Semite (but he writes well!),"An interesting book with as much BS as timely observations and personal anecdotes. But spend a little time comparing actual history with his descriptions of events and you realize he's another in a long line of inglorious ideologues who are willing to twist the facts to justify their visceral hatred of Jews and Israel. (Well, probably not INDIVIDUAL Jews; as long as they're willing to be history's traditional victims, Bob will write mournful paragraphs descrying their fate.) A book that proves that really good propaganda and anti-Semitism needs to be well-crafted to be effective."
1,Reporting distorted by hatred of U.S. and Israel,"Robert Fisk has thrown himself with passion into the task of reporting from the Middle East, often exposing himself to great danger, and he has done this for decades. He is an articulate speaker and writes well. He presents the POTENTIAL for great reporting given his commitment and skill, but ultimately Fisks work is undermined by his strong anti- American anti- Israel opinions. Even a cursory examination of this book bears that out. Once again he appears much, much more as a propagandist rather than a reporter."
5,Easily one of the best books I've ever read,"This book explains what's going on in the Middle East. It would be exciting to read even if it was fiction, but it's all true and very recent. After reading it I could understood events on TV news from the Middle East for the first time. Read the first chapter about one of his interviews and see what you think."
4,"Great book, item in bad shape","I was sent a copy in bad shape. The thousand and something pages of the book are not correctly cut, so the side of the book is not an even surface but rather a roller coaster of pages of different lengths. It's the second time I get an item that should not have been shipped. Get that quality control going Mr. Amazon!The book though is great if you are interested in the geopolitics of power from the Middle East to Central Asia, during the last century up to the present."
3,The Great War for Civilisation,"I devoted at least 7 months of 2006 to reading this huge work. It is without doubt the most depressing book I have read. The unrelenting description of man's inhumanity to man does not make for happy reading. The subject matter almost dictated that this book needed to be read through to its conclusion, however, the bleak, nihilistic content did not make for happy bedtimes. It only gets 3 stars from me because Mr Fisk does not give alternatives to his description of these shocking events. I would hope things need not be so bleak, but Mr Fisk gives me no hope that the worst wont happen as a matter of course."
3,Overload of detail seasoned with bias,"I read all 1,100 or so pages of this book (although it was a struggle) since I am interested in the recent history of the Mid-East. As I did, I gradually became aware of what appeared to me to be a one-sided pro-Arab bias. Repeated descriptions of burned out vehicles and charred corpses on the battlefields Fisk witnessed (sometimes while the guns were still firing) became repetitive and tiresome. I believe that all countries of the Middle East deserve some of the blame for the troubles there, but I could find few if any first-hand descriptions of the destruction visited during those years by the Arabs and their allies upon the Jews of Israel. While I found much of this memoir-cum-history interesting, this is hardly an objective analysis. It certainly could have been much shorter."
5,Truth,"If a superior intelligence was to visit this planet and analyze this book it would come to the conclusionthat humankind is not worthy of further existence, because retrogressive evolution has make Homo sapiens a threat to the natural order.P.S. This book is one of the best that I have read in my life time."
5,Fisk's definitive work,"I think this mammoth but absorbing book will eventually be regarded as the definitive journalistic work on recent Middle Eastern history and politics. In it, Fisk comes across more as a Wilfrid Owen of prose than some left-wing ideologue. What I also like about his writing is that it shows up all the main protagonists (Bush, Blair, Sharon, Arafat, Hamas, Hezbollah,Islamic Jihad, Shin Bet, Hussein, the Shah of Iran, Khomeni and so on) for what they are or were: as bad as each other. And that's what infuriates the different supporters of this motley bunch, isn't it? Nobody gets to claim the moral high ground."
5,The Great War for Civilisation:The Conquest of the Middle East,"I Have not finished reading this book. However, because I've heard excerpts from it from the book's author on LINK.TV, I know it is well written, very informative, and will be a great addition to the personal library of those who are interested in the Middle East as I am."
5,A great book from a great author,I have listened to Robert Fisk speak on Link TV but had never purchased one of his books until now. I have nothing but praise and admiration for one of the best authorities on what is going on in the Middle East. Robert Fisk lives in Lebanon and tells it like it is. I only hope that the war does not kill one of the best writers and journalists of our time.
4,Refreshingly Bright,"A terrific cd; the lyrics are ""up close and personal"" The band is excellent; outstanding vocals & the keyboardist is one of the best. She knows how to enhance without overpowering. After hearing the cd once, you'll press the remote or might even jump up to play the cd again. This is one that you'll ""live with"".Good gift idea for upcoming holidays!"
1,Is this satire?,"This CD is either a brilliant satire of pretentious, self-involved, ""arty"" folk-rock swill or it's just another scrap of half-baked, pedestrian swill. Cover art is interesting, must mean something to someone. The ""I'm so deep"" poses represented in some of the band members photos is laughable - which further leads me to believe this is some kind of satire I'm not quite getting?"
1,Fire Captain Written Exam Study Guide - an absolute disaster,This book is an absolute disaster. The author has so many typos and blatant grammatical errors that he can't even hope to be taken seriously. This is the most poorly written and thrown together publication that I have ever seen. I hope he is better at being a veteran firefighter than he is a writer. His department should have set an 8th grade education level as a minimum requirement for employment. I actually think he simply re-wrote some generic SOG's and text that he stole from IFSTA and paraphrased using his limited vocabulary to avoid a copyright infringement.
5,All coaches of young players need this.,"I bought this video for my wife who is coaching 6-7 year olds. This is her second year to be coaching, and she was just limping along and getting by in her practices. I suprised her with this video, and she was very excited after watching it. She couldn't wait for the next practice. After the practice, she said it was the best she ever had because she used the techniques from the video. On the video, the instructors go into good detail and break things down to make them simple. They do a good job of giving an outline of how to run a practice from beginning to end. I would recommend this video to anyone coaching 5-8 year olds."
1,There are better products out there,"First of all, I paid $25 for this, which was way too much. Second, it really doesn't give a lot of ideas for teaching little kids how to play soccer. Sure, there are some drills, but not very many--not enough to keep a bunch of 5 & 6 year-olds content for 60 minutes.And by the way, what kind of medication did he use to keep the group of kids in the video so focused? If I had kids with that much attention span, I wouldn't need the help the video purports to provide.Bottom line--too expensive, and very little material of worth. I've seen much better stuff out there. Keep looking, you'll find it."
3,Fun game - but didn't have lasting value,This is a clever game and is fun to play. I found that even some adults found it challenging and would imagine that it would be too hard for some kids. I was surprised that it only came with two pads of paper...
4,well made game,"This game has a lot going for it. It is sturdy and cute. I like that it has a few different steps, picking the cards (number of moves), turning the carrot and moving your bunnies up the hill. The kids liked when the bunnies fell in the holes, which occurs when you turn the carrot and it opens a hole in the ""mountain""...it never got old! You can easily change the rules a bit, and make the game go faster or slower by changing the number of bunnies each player has. I think by time a child is 6 or 7, they might tire of this quickly, but for the three and four year olds that we had playing, they didn't get bored for a long time, and have asked to play on several occasions. This is also reasonably priced, a good choice for the preschool set."
3,Fun for Younger Kids,My three-year old son enjoys playing this game. It's simple and straight-forward enough for him to understand and play. My older nieces and nephews (between ages 5 and 8) got bored with it pretty quickly though.
2,Uninteresting to a 6/7 year olds,"This game has all the bells and whistles that are perfect for 6 & 7-year-olds: bunnies, carrots and hot pursuit to the top of the bunny hill!Unfortunately, the ""holes"" are pretty predictable, and anyone can easily figure out how to avoid them. We played and played the game and not a single person's bunny was lost. Until we began to TRY to get them sunk.Since the first day we got it, there has been no child-driven interest in playing this game again.I am so glad that I didn't pay for Funny Bunny, I would have felt ripped off."
3,"Doesn't work as designed, but the kids still had fun","The basic idea of this game is that you're all racing each other up a hill, but sometimes by random chance a hole opens up underneath your bunny and you fall down and have to start over. The strategy then comes from the fact that you can bet everything on a single bunny and move more quickly, or hedge your bets by starting multiple bunnies up the hill.The problem is that in practice the frequency of getting dropped through a hole is so low (we've yet to have it ever happen) that you always just run a single bunny, which reduces the game to just dumb luck based on the cards you draw.That said, my 4 and 5 year old still enjoyed the game and were laughing and playing with it long after I grew bored."
4,my 4 year old loves this game!,very cute game. my daughter loves it. she gets such a kick out of the bunnies falling through the holes. highly recommended.
3,Very simple,"I'm not sure why this has the age range 5-10 on it. There is no reading required, and not even number recognition. If your child can play CandyLand, they can play this. The game play is simple, though the instructions are a little lacking (are you supposed to use all 4 bunnies at once, or focus on one until it falls through and then start a new one until you either win or lose all 4 pieces?) The 5-year-old boy finds it mostly fun, though since anyone can pull the carrot cards and, thus, cause any player's bunny to fall through the hole, he has a harder time not getting upset than in other games where he only has setbacks based on his own actions. Otherwise, it's a reasonably fun game."
4,Cute alternative to Hasbro and other mainstream toys,"I got this to play with my 3 year old even though the minimum age is 5. I tried playing it with her it was a little bit of a challenge. As a game, overall, it's cute. It teaches minimal counting skills (up to 3). You also have a risk factor in play (will the bunny 'drop' in the hole with the turn of the carrot?). The directions weren't as clear as I'd like them to be though and I'm not quite sure where the name ""Funny"" in Funny Bunny came from??? Overall I liked it. My next step will be to take it into my classroom and have my gifted kindergartners play with it. Until my update, I suggest a purchase of it."
4,Great gift idea,"I was pleasantly surprised with this game. I had never even heard of it before, but I noticed that many reviewers gave it high ratings. I got it to give to my brother's children (5 and 7), and they seemed to love it! The game looks like it is high-quality and durable. They seemed to figure it out pretty quickly and played it quite a few times. I am thinking about getting another one for our family."
4,Lots of Action,"Funny Bunny is a durable fun game for children ages 5-10. I played this game with my 3,5,6 year old grandchildren. The object of the game is to be the first to reach the carrot at the top of the hill. Each player picks a card to move the playing piece a designated number of spaces. The bunny pieces land on ""holes"" which may collapse if the carrot is turned (indicated by a card). The bunny that reaches the top of the carrot first....wins! There really isn't any skill or memory involved,just luck. But there is plenty of action to delight the younger children. The directions indicate that a ten year old would enjoy the game. I don't know about that; it certainly was action-packed for the younger age group."
4,Another Nice Ravensburger Game For The Younger Folks !!,"This is a nice, easy to learn game for the younger set. Two of my grand- children have been playing this game for some time, and seem to enjoy the game. The game is easy to learn, durable, relatively inexpensive and sturdy enough to last a reasonable length of time. The concept revolves around being the first to get a juicy carrot to the top of the hill. The idea of the game is to hop over some holes and to race to the top. Like many toys today, it bears a ""Warning: Choking Hazard."" This should be kept in mind, when youngsters are playing with friends. The game seems to be a little more on the expensive side, but most new toys like this bear similar pricing. Generally a fun game."
3,fun if you think beyond the game,"I got this game for my 5 year old. The game is pretty straightforward. Pick a card and move either 1,2, or 3 spaces, or if you pick the carrot card, turn the carrot and the ""hole"" moves locations. if the hole opens up under your bunny, you lose the bunny. The objective of the game is to get to the end of the path and claim the big carrot.This game is pretty boring for an adult. For my son, he found more enjoyment thinking of this as a playset rather than following the rules of the game. He was quickly bored by playing the actual game, but when he made up his own stories and adventures and used the bunny pieces as action figures, he had a much better time. We also had fun bringing it to a party and getting melodramatic every time we had to turn the carrot, but i can't imagine it being very exciting the 2nd(and certainly not the 3rd) time. I imagine he'll be bored of this game in a week."
1,Weak,"This game did not hold my child's attention at all. In short, the game has a trail-like path winding around a mound of earth. Along the trail are several trap door-like spaces. When a card is drawn, it directs the child to activate the mound, which in turn causes one of the trap doors to fall open. If your figure is on the door and it opens, you lose.Unfortunately, the game is way too simplistic, even for a young child. After about 5 minutes of play, my child was over it. Cute concept, but it needs a lot more functionality/features to be interesting."
4,"Fun, easy game","This is a fun and easy game. Our 3 and 5 year olds really enjoy playing it. It is simple to teach and simple to play, but also entertaining (my kids are tickled anytime a rabbit falls into a hole). Each player starts with 4 bunnies of a color. Players take turns drawing cards which either have you move your bunny 1, 2, or 3 spots or have you turn the carrot in the middle which moves the rabbit hole around the board. The object of the game is to get one of your bunnies to the center of the board without falling into the shifting hole.My only complaint is that I wish it had more cards (you go through the deck quickly, especially if you are playing with 4 people), so we didn't have to shuffle so many times each game."
2,not all that,it looks good. but not as sharp as i expected. don't waste your money. i have the 4 star henckels bread knife and in my opinion is alot sharper. it's also cheaper. good luck.
5,Perfect bread knife,"This is a big enough bread knife at 9"" that it can cut through the biggest loaf of bread with little effort. I've used it on bread right out of the oven with no problems or flattening at all. It's such a hard steel that I feel confident in it and it fits in my hand well."
4,It done scared the bejeezus outta Mamma!,"Man, I bought this here feller as one of them April Fools Day things and I ain't got the patience fer waitin! I done stuck this here in Mamma's commode last Saturday and hoooooo daddy she done let out a whoop like she done saw the devil hisself! Sure, she done fell backward over Pappy's stack of playboys and busted her hip one good but we was all laughin and hollerin it up family style that she weren't too upset about the whole thing. I do think she gonna be a little sore when she figgers out I done took the rest of her pain pills so I could make rent this month but what can ya do? Gotta have enough money fer my silver bullets and keep gas in the tractor. Life ain't all peas and carrots over here neither!Anyhoo, this contraption'll scare the devil hisself! You oughter buy five er six of um, they's gonna be a big hit at the truck stop on chili night!"
1,Too many errors for comfort,"After getting through about 80 pages of the book, I had found too many errors to feel comfortable about the book. Some content was obviously around from VB3, as some of the statements in the book would have not been true from VB4 on. Overall, I think the book has potential, but I returned it. If there is a next version, I will take another look at it."
4,Passed in 2 weeks,"After long break from Visual Basic, I used this book as an only material without even using the computer and I passed with above 85% score. The book is explicit and can even be used as a reference for future development. The tests at the end of each chapter helps to access your understanding of the chapter. On the other hand there were some typo-graphical errors in the book and some of the answers to test questions seems to be wrong, which can be confusing. Conclusively, I will recommend this book to anybody that wants to take the VB5.0 certification."
4,I passed in 2 weeks and never programmed in VB before,"I passed in 2 weeks, and I have never programmed in VB before walking through this book (I took RPG a long time ago). I also used the Transcender practice exams for reinforcement (their explanations as to why an answer is correct/incorrect are a great clarifying tool). The presentation here isn't perfect (20 pages of overview with graphical depictions of VB, class, and COM architecture would be a great aid). There are typos and some wrong answers (the question/answer set does not give explanations as to why an answer is correct and others are incorrect), but it has enough of the correct content in the proper balance to get you a passing grade."
2,Big Headache,"I have read some pretty badly edited books before, but this was too gruling to keep around. At about 80 pages into the book I had to return it for a full refund. No one obviously proof-read this book."
4,Pass your exam!,"I found this book to be a terrific resource for studying for the microsoft exam. (Yes, I passed on the first try) There are some minor errors in the book, but I did not find them to be a problem. The practice tests are similar to the actual exam. Know this book, and you will pass the exam!"
4,A great guide for the experienced developer,"The guide emphasizes on the areas you are most likely to be tested in. Although I was very successful with using the book, it's because I've used the language now for 1 year and was able to identify the errors in the CD-ROM and the text. Even with the minor problems of this book, I will definitely buy the same book for later versions of VB."
4,"Excellent material, this book w/ experience was all I needed",I really enjoyed this book and the material was well covered for the exam. The typos were there but an errata list was posted on the website as of June 1998. In my opinion it was well worth the price as opposed to spending several hundreds even thousands for a training course. With my experience and this book the VB 5 Exam was no problem. I tried others and they were of no comparison.
4,I used this book and passed in 1 and half months,"I am 18 years old and never studied in any computer course before. I bought this book and passed the exam in 1 and half months with a 847 score. There are some wrong anwsers with the practice exams in this book, but overall, it covered the real exam pretty well. I would recommend it."
3,Pretty Good Book,The book covers the subject material well but this book alone is probably not enough to pass the exam. There is much to know. Don't let the bed bugs bite.
4,This book appears to have been rushed to publication.,"The requisite information was contained in this book, however, it was often difficult to follow. This is mostly due to the numerous editing errors, omissions of Figure and Listing numbers, inaccuracy of a few of the Chapter test answers, and the occasional errant typed value and/or expression name in sample code listings. The most annoying of these problems was that the implementation of proper sentence structure (plain English) was incorrect, making the logic of the text hard to follow. Combine this with the annoying little habit of not separating sentences with spaces, and you've got a big headache trying to digest this information. Altogether, this made the reading and understanding of many of the topics slow going. I managed to finish the text with moderate comprehension in about a week (8 days). I would recommend this book, but I caution potential users to pay close attention, in order to ascertain the author's true meaning."
4,"Several mistakes, but an excellent book for certification","I studied with this book for six weeks and passed the exam my first try. I have a couple of years of VB experience, though, and while the book certainly gave me targeted items to learn, a more general overall knowledge is what helped me understand what I was reading and allowed me to catch the mistakes that still exist in the book. The author has a smooth writing style that makes the book an enjoyable read.I would recommend this book and have passed it on to some coworkers for their certification studies. Just be sure to get the errata, and know that an ActiveX document HAS TO run in a container, no matter what the chapter in the book says. But that's the kind of thing you would only know if you looked through the manuals and worked with the product. Definitely use VB while you're studying; don't expect one book to get you through.Best of luck!"
4,pan for toaster oven,It was exactly the correct size for my toaster oven-just a little pricey for the shipping.
2,bibles are for believers,"To be fair, I did not read this page-to-page, but spent a few hours poring over it along with a few other books on Filemaker Pro in the bookstore.Unfortunately I have yet to find a book on Filemaker that goes significantly beyond the manual to explain and exemplify some of the more powerful features of Filemaker, say, the calculation fields and scripting. I'm a regular observer of the Filemaker forums online and can understand why they are so popular.I agree with the first reviewer that the book should not simply target beginners, as Filemaker is simple enough already to waste time on intuitive tasks.This for the true bibliophile."
2,Not very impressive,"I have usually found the ""Bible"" books to be fairly complete to allow for progression from Novice to Advanced user. However, this book provides only remedial information and most of this can be confusing. It does not address, other than a brief sentence, two-way relations, self-joins and other aspects of relational databases that make them relational."
2,bible of what?,"How is this a filemaker pro bible? It never goes beyond filemaker pro, the basics. The basics are also in the Filemaker Pro manual, which comes with the software at NO additional cost. Actual intermediate and advanced techniques with scripts and calculations are never covered.As someone who has spent way too much money on Filemaker Pro books at this point, the money on this book, and most of the others has been a big waste.Apparently Scriptology, Filemaker Pro Demysitfied by Matt Petrowsky and John Osborne, is the ONLY Filemaker Pro book available that covers actual Filemaker Pro techniques, calculations, and scripts. The Filemaker Pro Bible just doesn't do that.Filemaker can be very powerful, but from the bible, you would never know.Read the manual, buy Scriptology, and check out the filemaker newsgroup. Leave the bible alone."
1,Wrond item was shipped and long wait for refund.,The wrong item was shipped. It was a 5400rpm drive instead of the 7200rpm advertised. Refund took a long time to processes.
1,"This is NOT a box set. Review is for description, not movie.","This is only one movie, #18 Zatoichi:The Blind Swordsman.All of the reviews and some of the quotes above are misleading describingthis as a box set. It is NOT a box set!!!!!The one star is for this reason only. I have not watched the movieand can't review it fairly at this time.I just hope Amazon corrects this soon."
4,Fine group but not the best choices,"I love Funkadelic both back in the day and buying them to complete my R&B; collection from way back. George Clinton recorded first for Westbound (where this collection came from) and Priority. The Westbound work is, in my opinion, edgier and more rocked out.""Maggot Brain (Live)"" is a good choice, but why cut the live version off? There's still maybe 9 minutes left on this CD and the live version ran to about 10 minutes on the original vinyl.""Funky Dollar Bill"" is the singles version. I had the LP back in the day and the LP version didn't sound so distorted. Again, there was enough room for the LP version, so why not actually put the finest up there for us to hear? There was room for it.Of course, my two favorites: ""Get off your @ and Jam"" and ""Undisco Kidd"" are here, plus some tunes I've never heard before. Overall, a great find--just not the finest versions of a couple of songs I really liked.Rebecca Kyle, May 2008"
4,String Tribute,"An excellent CD, a friend of mine introduced me to it. I've had heard but a few Tool songs before this CD, and the genius of the bands' original score may not be completely recognized (how could it, the songs were not originally intended for string instruments.) by this CD, but all those involved did and excellent job of portraying the power of the music, if nothing else. I recommend this CD, to all music lovers, even if you don't like Tool, give it a listen if nothing else, I think you'll be surprised."
3,"New Sound, Same Music - Third Eye in a Nutshell","I personally think that it truly shows how creative a band is when their music can SUCCESSFULLY be transformed into a orchastrated piece. Take Metallica and the San Fransisco Symphony Orchastra. What a joke. It sunk faster than a rock simply because it wasn't truly innovative or interesting, but rather a new way for Metallica to make money. Back to the real topic at hand, I think this CD was executed in the best possible manner-but it's still kinda flimsy. I still listen to this now and again, (and it's quite funny to see adult get hooked on this ""Contemporary masterpeice"") but the fact is you're better off picking up an album you're currently missing, or buying a couple of their (TOOL) singles. Otherwise, get this at your own descression, or if you want to prove to people that only TOOL can write music worthy of being so radically transformed."
5,Wow.......Great with Strings,This recording is amazing. What a trip to hear Tool with strings... Keep it up.....Sounds incredible...
3,Charlton's pieces were good... Gorfain on the other hand...,"When I bought this CD, I don't really know what I was expecting, but once I had listened to the first track, I had become completely mesmerized with it - that is, until track 3 came on. After listening to the album quite a few times, I have noticed a trend. Unfortunately there are only 5 songs on this CD that I would consider to be well done - those being composed by Charlton. Gorfain's seem to be just a ""job"" that he had to do, and one that he tried to do in a rush. He didn't capture the mood, the atmosphere or the harmony... I was disgusted. But, Charlton's 5 songs are definitely worth getting this CD for, Sober being pure genious and his other four trailing behind it."
2,"Good concept, poorly executed","The thing that jumps out at me, as a fan of chamber music as well as rock, is that the solo performances are terrible. The musicians playing the vocal lines almost always play them as if they were just sleeping through the recording sessions. There is none of the emotion and dynamic constrast that make Maynard's singing so powerful. Combine that with the fact that they're often completely out of time with the rest of the ensemble, and it just takes away so much from the recording that I can't get past it. There is potential in the arrangements, and if they were played by real musicians with a decent ensemble and some orchestral percussion added, they could be very worthwhile. The arranger is obviously a big Tool fan, but it sounds like the performers never took the time to listen to the real thing. As it is, this is not worth the money, unless you absolutely must have anything and everything that has to do with Tool, whether it is good or not."
2,is this really tool?,"2.5 STARSim an avid tool fan, and a fan of maynards various projects like apc and puscifer, so i know that his music is hard to live up to. this just didnt cut the mustard. the songs ar alright on their own but you can barely tell that its tool, i was expecting more along the lines of apocalyptica's tributes to metallica. they remain heavy but still keep the string sound. i recommend that over this any day.all in all if you're a classical fan, this might help you get into tool, but not vice versa."
3,"ok, but....","this is an awesome cd with and its great that they transposed these beautiful songs, but there seems to be ( other than aenema and ticks & leeches) an eerie quiet to these songs; it is as though an instrument is missing. Also, there seems to be times where they could've translated the song onto the string instruments into a different fashion so it could sound better. It sounds like they didn't take a lot of time in making this album and it's too good of an idea to be repeated by another without these mistakes. But nonetheless it's a great cd."
1,This is RIDICULOUS,"To all TOOL fans, don't even think about it.What a joke. Without Danny Carey's drums, and Maynards emotions these versions of these songs are pathetic. You could get a good laugh out of listening to ""Intolerance"", somehow that song doesn't seem to have the same power without vocals."
4,"I hate strings, but this ain't too bad!","I hate strings. They give me a headache like nothing else. But this is actually a decent tribute to Tool. It's very interesting to hear such renditions ... HOWEVER, even though artists have to make money, this is NOT worth the $. Buy it if you like Tool enough to want to hear such a peculiar tribute (but a good one). Otherwise, you're not missing out on a whole lot. Tributes. You know how they can be. Oh, and I agree with the other person who reviewed this album ... The ""hey"" sounds on Aenema are absolutely ridiculous. Hold your ears."
4,wonderful transition from distorted guitars to violins,"if you really like tool check this out. if you enjoy classical music, this is also worthwhile to look into. this tribute makes one realize the beauty of tool's music and it's amazing composition. listening to this and then listening to tool's actual material makes you realize they are not just a metal band but are rather their own style of music (though you shouldn't really need this to realize that). the players all come off as competent musicians, however it sounds as if whoever was behind the mixing board picked up a ""recording music for dummies"" book the night before this was recorded. it really does impact the overall sound of the cd, and one cannot help but wonder what such a project would sound like with a competent producer. however the sheer idea/execution of the project and the presentation of the musicians still makes it a great listen."
4,Good but not great.,"This is a very accurate interpretation of Tool. The artists on this album are extraordinarily talented, and did a great job transcribing Tool into a string arrangement. Although I think that it would have been much more powerful an interpretation if there were some kind of percussion elements in the album, as percussion is such a vital part of Tools music. This is a CD that hardcore Tool fans will no doubt enjoy, but its not for everyone, and I doubt it will get any long term use."
2,It COULD have been a great album.,"This album is an utter failure, musically speaking. They're TOOL songs, yes, but they lack the soul, the passion of a TOOL performance. It seems over-calculated, paying attention to the notes, rather than the feel of the song. In many parts, they try to replicate the vocal line, but miss or change a few notes, making an awkward sound for those who know the songs by heart. Also, there is little/no precussion, which gives you a boneless, hollow sound. If anyone else decides to try to adapt TOOL's music for string they should have at least one precussion insturument, and I suggest they listen to the music a few times before they pick up their bows."
2,Not typical Copag quality,Nice looking but too thin and flimsy. I have not been disappointed with Copag decks until this set. They have not held up to even moderate use.
3,Aromas and Flavors of the Past and Present,This collection of recipes is less anecdotal than 'The Alice B. Toklas Cookbook' however the notes that accompany each recipe are very useful. It is a relief to consult recipes that are elegantly simple compared to the glossy and overcomplicated creations so often described in fashionable cookbooks.
5,GREAT!!!,"THIS GAME IS AMAZING I WAS LOOKING FOR IT, AND I FIND HERE, AND IT WORKS GREAT I RECOMMEND SERIOUSLY."
4,One Great Game,"If you like the old double dragon or Golden Axe games you will love this game. The graphics and sound are top notch. You go through a mansion room at a time and fight all the ghoulies. There is a ton of power-ups and weapons. It can get a touch repetitive, but that just goes with the genre."
5,Jangle fever,"Beautiful compilation. Another one with magic stuff from Sarah Records, home of one of the most beautiful sound castles of our era. It was 80's and early 90's then, i was young and i hope i'll be really old and someday and capable of hearing this Byrdsy-Velvetian-Arthur Lee's Love jangle pop. Orange skies garanteed for fans of Razorcuts and the Field Mice or if you don't know these ones either, check them out. Pure ear candy."
5,Gorgeous Pop Music,"This is one of those cases where the Amazon recommendation was a godsend. Never heard of this band prior to that. The guitar sound they achieve is beautiful. The vocalist is understated but the style underlies the melancholy of the lyrics.On the first couple listens, the songs don't jump out at you, it presents more of an overall ""soundscape"", but I find a few of the songs sticking more and more.Also would highly recommend the Out to Sea collection. Hard to say which is better, that one has 20 tracks compared to 15 here (no duplication), why not get both?"
2,Lasted a Week,"The muzzle is soft and comfortable, but if your dog isn't already used to muzzles it probably wont last long. We purchased this for our Afghan Hound. The first time we put it on him he pawed at it and started ripping the soft mesh from the seams! After only a weak he managed to completely destroy the mesh, making the muzzle completely useless. We loved the concept and really hoped that it would work and it probably would for a smaller dog, but for the larger muzzles, it really needs stronger mesh."
3,Where's the lid?,The casserole arrived in a timely manner and in good shape. From the photo advertising the item I expected a lid to be included.
3,Watch which book you order,"This music looks wonderful but I found the labeling confusing. I thought I was ordering the Flute solo and the Piano Accompaniment but I ended up with the Flute solo and the Horn solo. When I get the right books, I'll re-review."
1,Misleading Title,"From all the Classical Guitar CD's I've acquired over the years, this has to be the worst. I can't believe that the title includes ""Virtuoso Performance"". It does not say who's playing guitar. I guess that's good for the recording artist. The playing is sloppy and the sound of the guitar is also not so good. When he played ""Adelita"" from Tarrega, He did it with overdubs ( mixing 2 guitars together ) It's horrible because the timing is off. The piece is such a simple piece, just record on one guitar.People don't waste your money on this one."
5,We're still pissed!!,"Great punk band from the good old days... if you love punk, the real punk, this is just an amazing record to get"
3,A Little Flimsy,"Alright let's start with the good. The seller has included several sheets to record game information on, and the sheets are very detailed. I was happy with this. The red and yellow cards are perfect and the wallet fits nicely into a pocket.But there's some bad news. The clear plastic that holds the game sheets in rips easily, and the sheets get crinkled and folded badly from opening and closing the wallet during a match. Still, the product gets the job done and is not expensive."
5,Just what I needed.,"I lost my last one, so this was a cheap, but good replacement. It came quickly and was just what I was looking for."
3,"If you don't referee that often, this wallet will work","If you are looking for a good starter wallet, this will work fine. However, if you are a seasoned referee, spend a little more, as the plastic sleeves tear after about 15 games. I have since taped them back, so it is working for me. However, i will go to Score Sports and spend a little more next time."
1,Chincy looking in person,"Looked great on the screen, but had sort of a cheap look in person. I returned it."
2,YOUR OUT!,"Now I have played many of the mario sports games...tennis loved it...soccer awesome....this however strikes out (honestly....) First thing it is WAY to easy to get someone out...because of that stupid circle that shows you exactly where the ball is going to land..im not kidding only about 1/4 of all the players who bat make it to first base its a joke you get a good hit and boom your out...the ball comes down to slow...very annoying, The controlls in this are also a big joke....specificly the throwing...I have a guy in a pickle (hehe sandalot) but he/she always makes it to the base..why? because the controlls are so difficult to use to throw the ball 1/2 the time im throwing it to third base when i want it to go to 2nd it is just plan retarded...im sorry but this game is fun at times...but nintendo dropped the bomb with this,"
4,Another hit,"Another Mario sports game, but one the best. Easy controls and playability make it a great pick up and go game."
2,Tired.,"Thank you Nintendo for another half-hearted and incomplete interpretation of a pro sports game. Your unparalleled brand recognition tricked myself, parents and fans pay full price for something that should been free on the internet. There is not enough content to keep this game interesting, Only one pitching viewpoint(top down) The batters float into position(ooh), theres only enough characters to fill the rosters of two teams. What the Fudge! On top of all that the actual game play was so laid back It felt like I was playing pool. I predict Mario and Luigi to be the best all around characters in Mario Wrestling, soon to be released with limited playablitiy at a store near you."
3,Gets old fast,This game was fun at first but not fun enough to keep me playing.Pros: 1)Easy controls 2)Good graphics 3) Lots of characters from the Mario SeriesCons: 1) Feilding can be difficult 2)Your players are stupid when it comes to base running 3)The game is repetative 4)HItting and pitching controls can be too simpleEither Way: 1)Obsticles in the feild can make the game random instead of skill. Sometimes it works in you favor during crucial games.Conclusion: 7/10I would recommed renting this game but not buying it.
3,baseball game for the kids,"Mario finally has his own baseball game. From a visual standpoint, this game is very impressive. Lots of colorful characters we all know and love, as well as lively ballparks and smooth sports action.This one, however, is really for the kids. This is due to the cartoonish, gimmicky style of play that Mario Baseball has to offer. For example, Donkey Kong doesn't use a bat when he steps up to the plate, he uses a boxing glove. A couple of other creatures use rods. One one of the ballfields there is a stream running through the outfield, and on another, giant plants that will gobble up the baseball. This isn't baseball in the purest form, but more of a Saturday cartoon version of the sport. But with all the colorful graphics and cool sounds, I doubt the kids will mind at all."
2,worst mario sport game,"unrealistic size fields - they are tiny yet very little balls go really deep, baserunning is horrible, the fact you have to constantly power up your pitch and swing to achieve something good gets old fast, bad overall control of the fielders...there's no fun to this game"
2,make it stop,"i,melisa, love mario party and mario sports and i want them all. but there is too much why cant they just put all the sports in one. to have every sport and party it will be 500 dollars. so its not fair and aint waisting my money. but more on the game. its pretty fun and its not like great but its a good game filled with special baseball games and tournements. in other words just like the other mario sports!! i personally hate baseball but i thought since it had the name mario in it id get it. it was fun for a week but then i forgot about it because after 2 or 3 days it becomes super easy and you wind up winning every game. its way to easy not enough things to do but there is a massive load of characters to choose from. bye(plaese no more mario half of walmart is covered with the name mario! im starting to like this guy in my school named mario.weird!!!)"
1,Worst baseball game ever,"I watched this video called lets play baseball i noticed this game is very dum GIRLY KIDDISH GAME SO NEVER BY THIS BASEBALL GAME!! That dumb looking cloud guy does not ref propely at all. And when you throw a strike it says straaaiiike in a stupid voice. And they are stupid impossible catches in this game and if it hits some stupid building block it is a homerun. And if you make a catch some very kiddish thing happens. You get hit by a chain chomp and the fielder loses the ball and the batter is safe. It is a dumb kiddy,boring,crazy,girlish and unrealistic video game. Only type of baseball worse than this is Monkey Baseball in Super Monkey Ball 2."
1,MARIO STRIKES OUT,MARIO STRIKES OUT WITH THIS GAME HI MY NAME IS GERALD AND IM REVIEWR TODAY IM ALMOST 10 THIS GAME STINKS TEH COMPUTER CHEATS AND IM SICK OF MARIO THE END.
4,Great fun and I don't even LIKE baseball!,"This was a purchase for my 7 yr old son's birthday. He LOVES it! I've played it with him several times and was surprised at how long we played. Our favorite part is swinging the bat. Not as much fun as MarioKart, but definitely worth the money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Waste of Money,"This game is not that good. It's a best seller because everyone THOUGHT it was gonna be good, but it's pretty boring! I mean, if you want to play baseball just go outside and do it in reality! There's nothing about this game that makes different from other baseball games. I've played quite a lot of mario games and bsides from the Mario Party games, this is the worst. so don't waste yopur money, if you're looking for a fun sports-theme mario, Mario Strikers is a good investment."
4,Just didn't catch me (lol),"This game just really didn't catch me to really liking it. I mean it's great that you can unlock SO mnay things and be every single player in MARIO HISTORY (and i'm not joking). This game has many crazy boards that can get annoying like Wario's. This game also has minigames which are sometimes BETTER than game! This game has powser ups for the MAIN players like Mario (fire ball) Waligi (liar ball) Bower Jr (bullet Ball)and many more. The weridest player are (goomba, Kemek, petey pirana (unlock him)adn others are strange in there own way. I really couldn't say wether you should buy this game or not, it all depends on how you would like a kinda slow moving baseball game.~this review was done by FinnyLemons14)"
4,mario baseball review,"I purchased this game for my grandson. He seems to enjoy playing the baseball game on a regular basis, especially with his friends."
1,This game is too hard,"I own just about every Mario game that has been out because I'm a huge fan of the mario games but I've been playing this game for almost a month now and I still don't understand the controls. It's so hard to hit a home-run. I bought a power bat in the game which is supposed to make your team hit homers and my team didn't even hit one. The only good thing is that I made it to the special level. I also think there's too many loading screens. This game is fun but you can get really bored with it really fast. If you want a good game, play Mario Strikers."
3,Now what?,"First off, if you want a good multiplayer game, here you go. Mario sports are always fun multiplayer, and it holds true here. But single player in Mario Superstar Baseball is abysmal. I had fun playing through challenge to unlock everything, and it took me about 9-10 hours of total gameplay. If there could have been some sort of a season mode it would have been excellent. There is NO replayability to challenge, and now that I've beaten it all I can do single player is sit around and play exhibition. With just a little bit more effoert, this game could have been marvelous, but my copy sits on the shelf collecting dust in between multiplayer uses."
4,Perfect undercabinet solution,We were looking for task lighting under a row of cabinets in an office. They did not want fluorescent lights. This was a perfect solution and gives brightness control (Hi/Low) at each work station. Easy to install as well. Only wish the three bulb version was centered in the fixture.
2,Weak and Unenlighten Treatment of Fencing,"As a competive fencer for over 25 years (member of 3 U.S. Junior World Championship team, U.S. World University Games team and top ten ranked fencer in foil)I found this book to be a poor guide to both the art and science of fencing. It is rigid, dogmatic, and outright misleading. I appreciate the scholarship and some of the historical accounts of schools of fencing. However, this book fails to help newbies whether they be interested in the sport or just the discipline of fencing to enter the exciting world of mind, body, and spirit conjured by it. To quote other great teachers of fencing, ""It takes a life time to learn how to fence and life time to fence."""
5,Why Is There No Place For Tradition,"As a fencer being taught by only modern fencing instructors, I was refreshed by the Evangelista aproach to discussing the honor and tradition of the sport. I now remember why I started to fence."
1,Sad little book,Within 24 hours of receiving this book in the mail I was selling it at a used book store. Save yourself some money and pass this one by.
5,An excellent book - a must reader for any fencer,"An easy to read book written with the readers in mind, this book presents a great deal of information in a format that is enjoyable and educational to read. The author's views on many of the vices of the modern fencing world (i.e. pistol grips) is a refreshing bit of honesty and sensibility. I highly recommend this book to any begining fencer or seasoned veteran for a fresh look at one of the greatest arts known to man."
1,Buy Any Fencing Book Other Than This One,"I have read about, practiced and taught fencing for 22 years now. Never in all this time have I ever read such a bad book on fencing! While the techniques Mr. Evanglista shows are not wrong overall, the ""facts"", reasons and ""moral judgements"" he spews are ludicrous at best and damaging to those new to the sport at worst. Why call a guard pad by it's French term and not the lunge by it's? These meaningless contradictions permeate his entire book."
3,Haha,"Too too funny, Cal aka James, when you are writing two reviews using two different names you might not want to make your writing pattern so obvious. Always capitalizing the title of the book and too many ""--"" gives your writing style away. Oh my gosh, how I dare I defame Nick, please."
2,Okay book for a beginner,"If you are an absolute beginner, this book is okay but there are better books out there for beginners. Lot of his philosophy behind the book is so outdated and some of his assertions are laughable and ridiculous. If you don't believe me just do a search on his name on some of the fencing message boards on the internet and you will run into swarm of ridicule. If you read this book, take it with a grain of salt...Nick Evangelista is the David Carradine of fencing...the guy is a legend in his own mind."
2,Overly indulgent fencing flake,"While an excellent writer and story teller, Nick Evangelista has an extremely slanted view of the modern fencing world. While I agree with many of the points he makes, I cannot help but feel slighted reading it. In his opinion, any modern fencer is a hack who wields his weapon like a club. I cannot count the times I have come across people that have read his book and take it to heart and are extremly shocked when they finally face the reality of modern fencing. His view's generally cause more problems than he helps."
5,Two Thumbs up.,"A Wonderful Masterpeace Classic....The best fencing Book of the year. I give this a 30, If it would go up that high"
3,A little less 'I' and a little more 'you',"Many trees could have been saved if Master Evangelista left out the 'I' in this book. The information is invaluable, and he is indisputably a gifted artist, but the first 100 pages of this book are not about fencing, they are about Master Evangelista. The information is helpful. The ego is not."
3,"This book is very good, but very basic. Funky Pictures.",This book is allright but doesn't enter into enough detailit is not a scientific book about fencing.
3,advice and prescriptions,"You could skip this one, if you fancied. It's mostly Guenther with his input, there's actually little text from Longchenpa. And Guenther's really on a diagrammatic spree which I, at least, don't have the patience to decipher. The text itself is much more immediate than Guenther's abstruse lines and arcs and dotted lines and two way vectors and lengthy explications. If I were studying Guenther I might buy it, or if I really wanted the threesome for my library [hey, I did buy it!] but, otherwise, no loss skipping it. There are a couple of gems in the descriptions of meditation, but not such that aren't repeated in other forms elsewhere in the three volumes. And it can read as a bit contradictorily prescriptive in its outlining of requirements for the place of meditation and the aptitudes of the meditator, when the ultimate point is the misguidedness of valuing, or seeing, such differences."
3,Cannot recommend this book,"I have read over 100 books on Buddhism and love and cherish every one. This book is a convoluted translation that to me is unintelligible. I hate to criticise a translator who goes through such efforts to bring us the great masters, but I agree with Taylor's review above. Go elsewhere for a translation of Longchenpa."
5,Delicious,"This is how I like my historical romance novels--clean, pleasant to read, with enough historical detail to make me feel that I am there. No dirty behind-the-doors details, no emotional trauma torn from the newspapers, not a bodice ripper, but the kind of book you would not hide from your children with a pleasant pace. Perfect for escaping today's hectic world."
3,"Nice, unique tale","Emily Hendrickson is no Austen or Heyer but she creates a fun tale. While there is no sex, per say, she does break some of the strict ""regency rules"" as Harry kisses and puts his arm around Persys a few times. It'a light story, fairly predictable but a great way to spend a rainy day! I look forward to reading some others from this author."
5,Beautiful bedtime reading!,"The mix of stories in this collection was wonderful. A few old familiar favorites that I was glad to find and a lot of stories I had never read before. Each chilling in it's own way. I rationed them out, only one a night right before bed. I found ""Sweet Shop"" to be delightful, and had to turn the lamp on in the middle of the night to check under the bed after reading ""Such a Sweet Little Girl"". This book is definitely worth adding to your collection."
5,Works as Advertised,"It works as advertised, but I didn't use the included screws to place it under my kitchen cabinet. Instead I used foam mounting squares and two weeks later, it hasn't fallen."
2,2 light halogen,came with problems so to the trash. bulbs did not work so no quality control at thes manufacturer I'm sure
4,"Good Quality, Good Value","These socks are typical of Gold Toe - good quality and WYSIWYG socks. They have held up well through numerous machine washings and dryings. The socks are quite thick and comfortable, but almost too thick to wear in hot weather."
2,Shrinking Sock,"The height of the socks really shrunk after one washing, Gold Toe never did this before, something must have changed fron the manufacturer.Overall I'm a little dissapointed, won't buy again."
1,"Gold Toe used to be the stardard...NOT ANYMORE. POOR, POOR, QUALITY!","I have used Gold Toe socks for over 15 years. They USED to be the most wonderful, LONG LASTING, of socks. But, alas, all good things must come to an end. It would seem around 3 years ago, plus or minus some time, they had built up their reputation enough and it was time to sacrifice quality for PROFITS! All good companies go through this cycle.I emailed customer service last year and told them I had holes in the toes of about 6 pairs of socks. They sent me 12 new pairs. Pretty nice. I sent the old pairs in for analysis by their company. Almost all the pairs I was give failed and produced holes by the big toe in less than 6 months. I threw some away already. I emailed CS and told them about this and that they lost a lifelong customer.CRAP PRODUCTS.DO.NOT.BUY.GOLD TOE."
2,XL Socks,Good socks. Only issue is the calf size. I bought them thinking they were for XL guys and they are very tight on the calf-so not very comfortable or easy to get on.
2,OK for very basic intro,"I found the book to give a basic review of the features of microstation. It however did not cover some of the most important areas, plotting and printing for example. While most of us think printing is basic, in a cad program it is at time frustrating and this book devotes hardly any time to the subject. No clues as to how to set margins, no driver file info, not even mention of fences or views, I've found out a lot only by experimentation with no help from this book. I would like to see a book that also tells one how to set up for verious types of drawings from begining to end. Oh well, in search of the perfect book I remain."
5,Great Album,Hot IQs! I love them even though they are no longer playing together. Apparently they were a big hit in their city of Denver. Their music has vanished from iTunes and the Amazon MP3 store. I ordered this CD after I lost the original. So glad I could find it on Amazon.Great music. Awesome indie sound. Female drummer.
4,Great re-invention of Bach in the 20th Century,"Wendy Carlos' album was ahead of its time, and is still listenable today. Those familiar with the score from Tron will recognize Wendy's style immediately. Highly recommended both for the fans of Bach and the progressive rockers who like hearing classical music updated for ""our generation.""The updated version of the album features a final track spoken by Wendy herself on what items never made it to the album, what worked and why, etc. Interesting to hear her voice after all these years!"
4,"Ah, the memories.","Way back in 1969, I was a young high school student hearing this 'album' for the first time. Our music teacher played the album for us. I fell in love with it instantly. Over all these years I regretted not buying the album. I would search from to time, to no avail that is, until recently when a search of Amazon lead to this rediscovery. Wendy Carlos does a fantastic job with Bach compositions. All the complexities, vitality and fluid like properties of Bach's music is faithfully interpreted on what was, experimental electronic moog synth. What an accomplishment ! Superb.Please do yourself a favour and buy this CD. I think most music enthusiasts will want this CD. If you grew up in the sixties and seventies and loved the music variety of that era, you will enjoy this CD.I enjoy Bach also. For me, this CD is a good marriage.The bonus is track 13. Wendy's narrative. Thank you Wendy"
1,Switched-On Bach,"This is some Bach songs played on a synthesizer back in the 80's. Synthesizers were still in their infancy, so the recording is less than great by today's standards."
3,"A must-have classic, but not the best","I grew up with these record albums. Even at 40+ years old, they still get regular circulation on my turntable. I just recently went and purchased them on CD simply to make it easier to get into my iPod. My favorite album of all time, not just by Carlos but of all time, is the Well-Tempered Synthesizer. I would highly highly recommend that CD. Switched-On Bach is in the same vein, but less entertaining or ambitious with the complexity or layering. It's not that it's a stinker, just a little less magnificent than Well-Tempered Synthesizer. Obviously, (like the Beatles albums) any well-loved old record will sound different than you are used to on CD. Not much is lost on these. My pristine LP is gorgeous, but let's get real. Am I going to meticulously transcribe, split the tracks, etc. just to gain a teeny bit of resolution from an ancient Moog??"
4,Switched-On Bach,"Although I had heard the occasional use of the Moog Synthesiser I was encouraged to hear more via BBC Radio 4's ""Desert Island Discs"" with Richard Griffiths when he chose the Brandenburg Concertos as one of his records ( - albeit wrongly described as by ""Walter"" Carlos.)I am glad that I eventually found it as the record is superb, despite the enjoyment of the music being abruptly changed by an explanatory piece by Wendy Carlos - albeit excellent in its own right. I hope that Amazon will stock her ""Switched On Brandenburg"" in the same genre."
5,The Granddaddy of all Electronic Music,"This is where it all began: Wendy Carlos, Bach, and the Moog Synthesizer.Includes a bonus track narrated by Wendy. From here, Carlos went on to do the soundtrack for ""A Clockwork Orange"" and other works. Sheer genius!"
5,"How about ""class by itself?""","Sure I had record albums of music by Tchaikovsky & Rachmaninoff, but ""Switched-On"" was my real intro. to ""classical"" (orchestral) music. I still have this vinyl album, but I seldom drop the tonearm on it anymore: I'm afraid the stylus will come after me. Brandenburg No. 3 with its dripping water 2d movement puts this recording in a class by itself.So I should get this on CD. I remember people had never heard of Walter Carlos, & a short while later no one did again, for he'd returned as a she named Wendy. Regardless of what meaning ""original"" has these days, Walter C. & ""Switched-On"" were just that. & That album cover wasn't bad either."
2,"Old, but Reliable","I used this joystick on an older computer that had a standard gamport. Most computers sold today do not come with a standard gameport anymore, but you can get an adapter, or some video cards come with them, and you can buy a PCI card that has just the gameport. It stood up well, overall. I used it for about three years, and in the last year the base of the joystick became very loose, but it still held up with most games as long as I kept it callebrated. All of the buttons worked well, and the throttle. If you have a gameport, and need a stand-by joystick, this will work. Otherwise, you will want to look for a better USB joystick."
2,disappointing,"The guitar concerto has its moments, and they are very reminiscent of something else--I think ""Future Legend"" from David Bowie's ""Diamond Dogs"", oddly enough--, but otherwise it is cartoonish and eventually tiresome. My main objection, however, is that the guitar is jangly, pinched, and nasal sounding throughout. The orchestration is over-wrought--too much doubling, too much percussion.The second selection is a sophomoric pastiche of various incongruous famous themes."
2,yawn.....,"it looks like I'm the first to review this dvd,I guess people are too ashamed of this cartoon,I think for the most part the series was crap,done with crappy animation and voice actors who couldn't even get the names of the characters right,the only cool thing about armada is UNICRON wwhich appeared in the final episodes (even though he just stood there like an idiot and didn't destroy anything)also starscreams story was cool the little brats (the human kids, carlos ect)were the most annoying things in this series I was hoping a transformer would step on them, the fat kid made me want to hit the tv screen, you can only take so much of a fat kid saying ""I'M HUNGRY""...for the gen1 fans don't waste your money on these single discs,if you want to buy this series it would be worth your time waiting for the boxsets..."
2,"Great design, doomed by poor electronics assembly","Pros: Classy, understated appearance. Low profile. Very accurate when it works right.It worked great for perhaps 2 weeks, then occasionally would get stuck in a mode where it added about 30 pounds. New battery made no difference. After a few months, it failed completely.I did not keep the packaging or receipts (will next time), so I had to toss it out. But first, being an electrical engineer, I took it apart. The soldering on the circuit board was horrendous, a typical result of cost-cutting outsourcing. This little circuit board would normally be assembled by machine, but was instead was manually soldered by someone with obviously little training and/or care (who was likely being paid next to nothing).To see the classy product of talented designers doomed by clueless cost-cutting is all too common."
2,Very Disappointed,"Every time we used this scale it gave a drastically different weight. We returned it to Amazon, probably the first time we've ever had to do that. For the price it should at least work. Also, in only the 4 days we had it a large chip came off the corner. It earns two stars for looking great. I would not recommend it."
2,don't buy,"I have had this scale for a few years, but like other people here, I have discovered that it doesn't last. Replacing the battery made no difference. It's past the warranty period, so that's not an option. The Soehnle people say that they don't repair. I hate the throw away society we've become, but it's a useless item now. I can't do anything else but toss it. Sigh."
2,Looks Great. Thats it.,"Great looking scale, very low profile, gets compliments. owned for less then a year and then it just went haywire one day. Soehnle will replace it but it will cost you shipping. No its wasn't the batteries. From what I could figure out, one of the four pressure sensors went bad and that caused the whole thing to malfunction. what a let down. I cant find another scale that looks as nice as this. Just remember, you've been warned. It will break in about one years time."
4,"Fits Universal 1-3/16"" Guide Bushings","Bought one of these for my Skil 1825 router and it does fit standard 1-3/16"" Guide Bushings.The piece itself is a little flimsy, but it fits the Skil router and was able to make dovetails using standar Guide Bushings."
4,Oddly missing from the router,"I bought this to use a dovetail jig. Really should come with the router especially since it's so hard to find elsewhere. Kind-of hard to get centered properly, probably could use some washers (though that would possibly make the screws stand too proud) as the screws slide when tightened."
1,incompleto,este adaptador requiere otra pieza adicional en el extremo la cual no viene incluida; deberia traerla y asi completar el adaptador listo para usarlo; en mi situacion la distancia de un centro especializado es muy larga asi que prefiero algo que este completo por los altos costos de envio o transporte.
3,Cruelty Is Seldom Erotic,"While there are some deliciously erotic passages in the book, there are also passages of great cruelty that are passed off as erotic but are merely sadistic. The objects of this sadism are primarily women so the book fails in its promise to deliver eroticism that women will find intriguing. Add to that forumla the fact that it is set in Japan where most of the men have multiple mistresses, and the mistresses and wives are depicted as jeolous and full of envy, and I found it impossible to truly enjoy the sexual exploits in the book. Better to find a copy of Yellow Silk if you want to experience eroticism without feeling slightly degraded as a woman."
3,Cute but hard to walk in them sometimes,"The shoes are really cute and they keep your feet nice and warm, but at times it's hard to walk in them, I think because it's really roomy (I have narrower feet). I like Rocket Dogs better."
1,"Skechers Women's Fortress Clog, Black, 9M.",I was very disappointed with this purchase. I have three pair of Skechers D'Lite winter clogs and love them. This style is much wider and I am unable to wear them. I hope the manufacturer will go back to the original last so that I can once again enjoy winter clogs.
2,Clogs,"I was not impress with these shoes, the are hot due to the fur, and they are not true to size."
3,Very Heavy,"I love the style, but they are very heavy on your feet! Hard to walk upstairs! I guess its a good workout though!"
2,Uncomfortable,"I really liked the look of these shoes and looked forward to getting them. They are very heavy but, more importantly, they are uncomfortable. The lining seems skimpy and the shoe was not snug enough to stay on my foot. As I walked, they slipped off, even with socks. I love clogs but these were a disappointment."
3,Narrow and heavy,I was very excited to buy these.... I pretty much wear crocs or uggs. My friend has a pair and loves them.I am on my feet most of the day and up and down stairs.These run very narrow and a really heavy.I am trying to give these a fair amount of time to see if they work out.Order a size up as they run small.
5,Works like a charm!,"Smells OK, is super slippy, and doesn't get sticky as fast as other brands I've tried. I highly recommend this product!"
3,Short Summary,"The daughter of her tribe's shaman, Werona is familiar with the ways of healing, a skill that comes in handy when she stumbles upon Rorik Wolframson, a Viking warrior shipwrecked off the coast of the new world."
1,Never Read It,Couldn't make it through the book. Mostly common sense. I just needed it for a class. Better books exist on the same subject. Get those instead of this marketing tool.
5,Nickel Finish Peacemaker Short Review,Length:: 1:39 MinsOverall I am very satisfied with the gun. It shipped lightning fast and arrived exactly when it was supposed to. Accurate description and pictures on Amazon. If you want a great replica that is near perfect then this is the one for you. People that don't know their guns will not be able to tell that this is not real!
4,VERY GOOD COPY OF A WESTERN REVOLVER,"GUN IS ONLY A PROP, BUT WITH THE DUMMY BULLETS, IT'S FUN TO HALF COCK THE TRIGGER, LOAD THE BULLETS AND SHOOT. ONLY PROBLEM I FOUND WAS THE DUMMY BULLETS GETS STUCK IN THE CHAMBER. IMPOSSIBLE TO REMOVE, EVEN WITH THE SHELL EJECTOR. I HAVE 2 STUCK IN THERE. I CAN ONLY LOAD 4 BULLETS. GUN LOOKS GOOD, THOUGH. IF YOU WANT A BETTER GUN, I SUGGEST A COLT PEACEMAKER BLANK 9MM REVOLVER. USES BLANKS AND NOT INTENDED FOR CHILDREN. I OWN ONE, AND IS MADE IN ITALY. THIS REPLICA IS MADE IN SPAIN. THE ITALIAN GUN IS BETTER QUALITY, SMOOTH WOOD HANDLE. THANK YOU"
4,From my youth,I saw this movie when I was little infact it was a constant rented favorite of mine at the video store until the store closed. I recently remembered the name and tried to find it on youtube but was unsuccscful. I couldn't remember the entire title all I could remember was the name Problemina then while searching google on a whim I came accross the picture of it and I had to have it! It is an entertaining tale from what I remember and well if your kids like the 2D animation of yore then they might like this as well.
3,Served it's purpose,"Bought these as a cake topper, wish it was a little bigger but you should always get out a ruler to see exactly how tall it would be before buying. They are pretty cute, however if you look at them closely you can see small errors with the painting of them. No big deal!"
5,Brutal Death At Its Best,"If there is one band that can define the meaning of intense brutality, it's Disavowed. It's easy to tell that Suffocation is one of their main influences, but Disavowed has its standouts as well. The vocals are intense, along with the drumming techniques and excellent technical riffage. What else can I say, other than this is a top-notch brutal death metal release that slays. Recommended."
5,GREAT GUIDE,"This book is a must have for the game Zoo Tycoon. Zoo Tycoon is pretty self explanitory, but the guide even helps. The instruction manual doesnt give tips on how to keep the animals happy, and i found that a common aggravation to my gaming. This book shows you alot of tips on how to keep them happy. If you dont have zoo tycoon, get it. It is worth it!"
3,Too Heavy!,"This bag is very unique and interesting. It stands out and gets tons of attention. The size is great and the inside compartments make life easier. I adore this bag, however, it is way too heavy! I use it for school books and materials but after just a day of use my shoulder was in pain. 3 days later my arm and shoulder are still sore! I reccomend the bag but don't put too much in it cause you'll regret it!"
4,Great Penny Jordan,"Chris is a successful model running away from a past that included betrayal by her true love Slater and her spiteful cousin Natalie. Chris fled her hometown after Natalie tells her that she and Slater are getting married because she is pregnant with his child. Years later she comes to find out her cousin Natalie has died and she appointed Chris guardian of the child, a girl name Sophie. Sophie is a beautiful child who bears an uncanny resemblance to Chris, who comes home to find the mess that Natalie left after killing herself. The tension between Chris and Slater is pretty powerful and Jordan does a good job building the story up and it is a really romantic story in the end. The reason I gave it only four stars is because I think the main character Chris had a few dumb moments leading into the twists and turns in the plot that I can't help but be like DUH! But overall a classic Penny Jordan. I am a fan."
4,I felt like an idiot...but my son had a blast!,"My son was right at the upper end of the age spectrum for this DVD (11mo when we bought it). He really enjoys the songs and finger plays...but he enjoys anything if mom is paying attention to him! This is not a sit and watch DVD...you follow along with what the video is doing so you are interacting with your baby. I couldn't sing Itsy Bitsy Spinder one more time, so this DVD really helped my come up with some new ideas to play with my son. It feels a bit amateurish and cheaply produced, but again...he doesn't care :-)"
1,Does NOT Provide Easy Access to Phone,"A local Cingular dealer sold this holster to my boyfriend for $15 to replace his broken belt clip. He realized too late that the holster grips the closed clamshell phone so tightly that it is difficult to get the phone out. The design is very poor, and doesn't allow you to open the phone clamshell while in the holster, therefore rendering this useless if you wish to answer any phone calls (and opening the clamshell is necessary to use the phone). But you cannot open the phone without freeing it of the holster, and this is done with some difficulty and frustration. A truly stupid product, with absolutely no forethought into its applied practical use. Don't waste your money, unless you are sky-diving and want something that definitely won't let go of your phone."
4,"Beautiful, but clasp isn't as described","The bracelet is lovely. The stones and weight are very good. However the bracelet I received didn't have a double safety clasp, as stated, and the clasp it does have has no safety feature and doesn't close well. I feel it will have to go back in the hopes of getting a replacement with the correct clasp. It is a very nice piece so hopefully I can get the safety clasp problem resolved."
1,The soufle that fell!,"This is a book that had the potential of being good, but never got off the ground. It starts with Connor, an undercover vice cop, checking into a call-girl operation being run in an old fashion restaurant, run by Winona (who is the suspected madam), but very little of the book is based on this at all. Ninety percent of the book is what is being thought in Connor's head about Winona, and in Winona's head about Connor. Except for one chapter there are no other people in the book.It didn't explain how the restaurant became the focus for the investigation, how the investigation was going, and in the end it didn't say how the problem was solved. I was very disappointed in this book."
3,NOT AT ALL WHAT YOU'D THINK BUT STILL ALRIGHT,"THIS BOOK IS NOT BY ANY MEANS SOMETHING YOU COULD USE TO LEARN HINDI. MAYBE A TRAVELLER COULD GET A LOT OF USE OUT OF ITS QUICK REVIEW TABLES AND OVER 600 EXAMPLE SENTENCES TO USE ON THE STREETS. THE IDEA IS THESE ARE TO BE SIMPLE CORE SENTENCES SO YOU CAN SIMPLY ""PLUG AND PLAY"" WORDS OR VERBS ETC. NICE FOR A TRAVELLER BUT NOT SO GREAT FOR A SERIOUS LEARNER. MAYBE YOU COULD USE THIS FOR SOME REVIEW/REFERENCE AND MAYBE TO PICK UP A FEW VOCAB WORDS YOU MAY NOT HAVE SEEN BEFORE. BUT OTHER THAN THAT WOULD NOT SUGGEST THIS AS A BOOK TO HELP YOU REALLY LEARN HINDI WITH, BUT AS I SAID WERE YOU A TRAVELLER I WOULD SAY TO GET THIS ALONG WITH SOME OTHER HELPFUL HINDI PHRASEBOOKS CIRCULATING OUT THERE!"
1,when it came it was white. 7 days later it was brown,when it came it was while. 7 days later it was brownI bought for a sound dampener alternative. Not that good but did ok. color changed right away
4,Sophisticated Views,"Clearly the views set out in this book are of high sophistication towards intellectuals. How fitting. John Michael breaks down intellectuals, and there specific roles, and duties in the American Dichotomy. Higher level readers will find great debate in the views set out in the book. A true account and testimony of intellectuals abilities, responsibilities, and roles in westernized society."
3,Marred by Errata,"The 5th edition of this popular book is, in my opinion, marred by a large number of errata (see the book's web page.) While it is common for technical books to have errata, I must raise some doubts about how carefully the book was ""proofed."" Needless to say, this is not exactly confidence inspiring."
4,Good basic reference,"This book takes a much more applied approach than I anticipated, especially when comparing it to the other book I ordered which was supposed to be applied. Overall it is a good book, it had a lot of good basic references, although I think it tried to tackle too much and could've been longer (even though I really don't want it to be any longer). Good reference though, easy to follow and it helped me in class, so it accomplished what I bought it for."
2,Would not recommend to a friend,"Owned the Remington system for 6 months and although the shave was fairly good (hence the two stars), the razor itself fell apart. The paint on the plastic does chip away, which doesn't sound like a big deal but you end up with small flecks of paint on your skin that are hard to get off. The cleaning system was quick and easy to keep up, but I don't think it is the best on the market. I ended up opening my wallet to purchase the Braun Pulsonic system and I am not looking back. That is one incredible shave and cleaning system. Good luck in whatever you choose but this is not the system that I would recommend to a friend."
4,Shaver works well,"My new Remington R-1000 is better than expected.Have only ever shaved with a blade system (over 50 years).Bought the Remington because it is considered kosher for Jewish men who wish to shave.My only complaint is that it arrived with a small chip in the head surface.The shaver works well, is surprisingly quick and gives a close shave.Gave 4 stars(would have given 4.5 stars if this was possible), since an electric shaver is not as quick or as close as a blade.ThanksstanslevyPS. It is now Sept 21/12.The razor head broke off on Sept 10th. I had used the razor for a month.The 3 Rotary blades are connected in the head of the razor which flips up to allow the blades etc to be rinsed. I did this after each shave. On Sept 10th the plastic connector snapped just after I pushed the clip to ""open"" the top. The razor is now totally useless,A review and note were written to the seller. As of today, no reply. I'd like a refund or replacement. I expected more from Amazon.Thanksstanslevy"
1,Remington,"Not the best like described, dropped it and it fell apart, not the best quality for the cost, would not buy again!"
3,Have had better shaves,This shaver cannot compare to my old norelco which is about 10 years old. It is louder and does not give as clean shave as the norelco. It has one advantage it does hold a charge the reason for me replacing my old norelco.
3,Flawed masterpiece,"It's a great shaver. Good clean close shave. But the paint peels after about 3 weeks. They sent me another shaver today so I'll see if the same happens. Sounds like from the other reviewers, it probably will have the same problem."
3,Not Happy,"The shaver never worked as designed. I followed the instructions to the 'T', but battery never held a charge for more than 2 shaves, even after several initial charges as instructed in the owners manual. Had to call Remington directly for a replacement (that was easy). They mailed it immediately without a hassle."
4,New 1999 Guide To Fast Food Collectibles !,"This new 288 page book is packed with over 500 black and white photos (16 page color section). It provides over 2,200 realistic prices for the items. Major topics range from Arby's, Burger Chef, Hardees to McDonald's, Wendy's, White Castle and many more. Interesting and useful text is included with each major topic. You'll want to add this book to your collectibles library if fast food collectibles are in your collection."
5,perfect,"It was my first time dealling with them. They were fast, good packing and product is very good. Honestly Im surprised cause everything was 100%."
5,Great book for home builder and home owner,"Gives practical, detailed, understandable descriptions of the main systems of a house and the process of building a new one. Invaluable reference for anyone building or buying a house. Very unfortunate that it is no longer in print (2002)."
3,Worth the price and to avoid the hastle,"I couldn't find this item in the store, so Amazon was a good solution. However, the sticks are cheaper (flimsier) than those I had as a child. It's probably worth it, but you might want to upgrade to a higher-quality version."
3,Okay,The sticks are kind of cheezy. The jacks are too small and not the original size and hard to pick up.
3,Nice Packaging but cheap quality procuct contents,Very nice tin canister to keep all pieces contained but very tiny cheaply made Jacks and Rubber Ball and Pick Up Sticks have the feel of oversized toothpicks and are pretty much useless to play with as they are very slippery. You don't even get what you pay for here.
5,very pleased,"Was a little unsure about buying this for my 4 year old, but she absolutely loves it. She cannot stop playing. She has a few more things to learn about the rules, but the product is very well designed. The pick-up sticks are made of plastic, and the tin they come in is great to keep up with the components."
1,Really bad quality,I ordered the toy to give for my son's birthday party as a favor.One look and i knew it was no good. The sticks were really flimsy and the jax too were of poor quality.I have bought better pickup sticks in the dollar store. I decided to return all of them and will not recommend this product to anyone. Pickup sticks is a really fun game - but I would not even pay a dollar for this quality.
3,Pick -up Sticks and Jacks and Ball,"I purchased this for a granddaughter as she loved my childhood jacks and pick-up sticks. The jacks are really flimsy with no weight in them. The sticks are OK, but my old ones are also better made. This was inexpensive but not worth the price."
5,now this one is hard to beat,"These two timeless games packaged together seemed too good to pass up. If my granddaughter beats me at one of them, then I can always get out the other and show her just what's up. She seems to enjoy playing them as much as I do, and it seems so much better than carting her off to the movies or sitting around watching the TV."
2,Not the real thing,I was very disappointed in this product. The pick up sticks are not the regular size that we had as children. The jacks also are very small and the ball that accompanies them is also smaller than what one would expect. I was excited to get these as I have fond memories of playing both pick up sticks and jacks as a child. I wanted to share them with my grandchildren. I will be looking for a better set of each of these games. I am very surprised at the number of positive reviews.
2,Tiny,I needed this for an adult game but it is very small tiny. It does come with instructions and in a big tin with a jack and ball set. All of the products are small and tiny. They seem to swim in the tin that is way too big for these items. It does come with instructions. Overall I recommend a larger more durable set.
1,Not the pick up sticks I remember...,"If you are looking for the wooden, nicely sized Pick up Sticks from your youth, these are NOT them. I was completely disappointed in this item. They are extremely small and made from cheap plastic. Unfortunately, these plastic toothpicks are going straight into the garbage. Buyer beware!"
3,Combo Tin,"I purchased this combo of the pickup sticks and jacks and ball. The pickup sticks are great, but I was very disappointed in the jacks. The jacks are very small, cheap, I am concerned about what type of material they are made of. Not worth the hype with half the product worth the price and the other half junk."
5,Wonderful Product!,"I have know about S.T. 37 for a long time. It is a wonderful product to keep in your medicine cabinet for first aid and other emergencies. I couldn't find it at the drug store and was happy to see it offered through Amazon.com. Best product for cleaning wounds, putting on a burn or sunburn."
2,bottle all warped,Received the product - box in good condidition however physical bottle was warped. not sure if this is a sign of being near too much heat. Have not used the product yet. Have had very good experiences with ST37 in past
4,I've been waiting for another Lois Simmie novel,"Ever since reading ""They shouldn't make you promise that"" I have been waiting for another novel, and was not disappointed with this one."
5,deeds is good,"blistering fast double bass, guitars, gutteral vocals. these guys are talented, and as brutal as it gets! hail deeds!!!"
5,deeds is back and brutal,"amazing cd great riffs,vocals,and everything elsenice low vocals,really heavey brutal death metal,everyone should by this cd if your a fan of brutal death"
5,"Heavy duty, looks nice too","Got these for my husband. They fit great, stand up well to washings, and look nice too. He loves them!"
5,Great pants,These are smoe of the toughest pants I have ever had. Pockets in all the right places and fit nice.
5,Great Product,"I've only had them for a few days, but so far I'm very impressed with the quality of these pants. The fabric is very sturdy and looks like it will survive pretty much anything. The construction quality seems good. As another reviewer mentioned these do seem to run a bit big, but I'm not a small guy and I appreciate the extra room. Probably my only complain is that the side pockets aren't as deep as my Levi jeans, but that's a minor issue."
3,Not the same as purchased in a physical store.,"I already owned two pairs of the Riggs Ranger pant which I purchased at a store about an hour away from my house. I really liked those pants.So I purchased two more pair through Amazon. The pants I received were much baggier, even though the measurements are the same as my other two pair (and no, I haven't lost weight, though I need to ;)). There were also many loose threads on most seams and pocket stitching. It seems like these were factory seconds or something, meant to be sold in an outlet store. I do not recommend purchasing these through Amazon.I've learned the hard way that purchasing clothing and shoes online will ultimately leave you disappointed, even when you have a reasonable expectation that the items should be the same as the same item purchased in a brick and mortar store."
2,Nice pants too small sizing,"I like the finish of the pants however they fit tighter in fhe waist and longer in the length than my usual size. Also the coler is dark green, and not the light tan color as in the picture."
4,Bark Color is like Olive Drab,"The picture is very misleading on the color. If you are a veteran, these are the color of Vietnam era fatigues -- O.D. green. I happened to like my fatigues so I think I'm going to like these."
3,I expected more.,"These ""work pants"" wear out way too fast. The parts that are reinforced were in my usage irrelevant. If you ever work on you knees these are not the pants for you."
4,The Riggs Ranger Pants are great. I have a few pair all are green so I wanted a different color and ordered bark which appears t,I have a few pair all are green so I wanted a different color and ordered bark which appears tan. I recieved another green pair.
3,seem to run small sized,"I wear a 34 relaxed fit Wrangler jean, so I bought relaxed fit 34 in Wrangler Riggs. Side-by-side the waist is undersized from the jean and noticeably tighter when worn. The relaxed fit must be in the seat but I'd probably have to get a 36 waist and wash them to shrink to fit but normally that makes the legs like balloons, so much extra material with a 36. You might consider a larger size than you normally wear for a comfortable fit."
5,Undestroyable,"I mean it, this pants looks as new as the first day. They are heavy, but that's the price for been so tough."
4,Best Cargo pants out there,"I have searched for many different kinds of cargo pants for work and Riggs Workwear have been the best. They have deep front (good concealability) and cargo pockets, a nice cell phone pocket and the fabric is durable yet comfortable. The right front pocket has a leather protector for those that carry a knife. They look good on a 6'3"" 195 frame, other cargos haven't been so friendly. The back pockets have no flap and the cargo pockets are snap flaps instead of velcro which is the reason I stopped wearing my previous favorite Union Bay cargos - the velcro flaps would always get bunched up."
2,Not equivelent to down.,"I know, I know, it's not a down pillow. But I've been using down pillows for 20 years now and I thought I'd try something different. Well this is different. In my opinion it is no where near as comfortable as down pillow, the product itself is just as advertised, and I can find no real fault with it. I just don't like them. My suggestion is that if you prefer a down pillow, don't think that these can substitute."
1,I guess we were just too addicted!,"I guess we were just too addicted to strong leadership and decisive action in '04! Maybe we needed a full blown 12 Step program, rather than just a derogatory bumper sticker, to get us to vote for anything but real men as our leaders!"
5,"Can Edmund White, Armistead and Felice Picano be far behind?",About time that some of the literary writers bring out some of their overt erotica--and this tasty anthology whets the appetite. A good cross-sample of stories with style and heat. I actually bought this book through [a local chain store]! How much more mainstream can queer porno get than that...This book is a keeper.
3,Is it just me?,"It's with some trepidation that I dissent from the unanimous acclaim of the other reviewers of this book. Admittedly Jack Fritscher is a skilled author and reading his atmospheric prose is a pleasure in itself, though not a particularly erotic one. The stories though are polished and carefully constructed to the point that, for me, the life is squeezed out of them. All of the classic icons of male erotica are here but their impact is muted. I would recommend this book for reading pleasure, but not any other kind."
4,Recommendation,"This book was hard to get and I actually purchased a used product; however, the chase and the wait was worth waiting for. The book provides the reader with an extensive overview over pediatric cancer, its etiology, treatment, and everything that's important to know. Working with pediatric oncology patient in a hospital setting, this book answered many questions. The chapters were written by different clincal disciplines, addressing the concerns from their point of view. At no point does the book go overboard (like so many other books about pediatric oncology,) where the author forgets the audience and makes little sense to the (non-medical) readers, mostly parents, explaining medical lingo thoroughly."
1,You've got to be kidding,"$300 for an opinion??? $300 for something you can find on the web in less than an hour of careful searching??? Who's opinion is this anyway? Ziff Davis Media? So it's a staff writer(s)?Come on guys, let's get serious here!"
1,Poor quality item,"I purchased Clinique mascara (Lash Doubling Mascara) from this seller (AZ Perfumes). I have used this mascara for years and have always before purchased it from a department store directly myself. To save time, I now ordered it using Amazon. The mascara from AZ Perfumes must have been from a stock 100 years old - it was all in clumps when I applied it the first time. The mascara went to trash (all three of them) and I lost $75.To use Amazon as a trash can for the old stock is a really bad and low integrity business practise."
1,caveat emptor,"I guess the 90-day warranty says it all. My unit performed well for about that period and then gradually got worse.Now it refuses to play almost any CD I put in it. When it works, it occasionally has highly distorted output, will get confused in the middle of a disc or will just switch off.It's pretty much unuseable now.So I go the Coby web page figuring it's still within a year of purchase, only to learn that after three months you're on your own."
4,I like it a lot.,"I've had mine for almost 2 years and have had no problems at all. Kind of hard to believe since it gets tossed around my backpack a lot. I can burn over 100 mp3's to a cd-rw. Great for long road and plane trips. The included headphones are uncomfortable and the search feature is a bit difficult to use, but it sounds good and for the price, nothing beats it. I like it a lot."
2,Not safe,"My son got this for his 1st birthday. He loves playing with it and even though it is 18 m and up, he is able to use and learn with the toy. My problems with this item are 1. It is very heavy and when he turns it over to get to the other sides, he has hurt himself by doing so, he is not a small fragile child either. 2. One of the latches came off and I found it in the floor. 3. A screw came out and I also found this on the floor. Obviously he could have swallowed these pieces. This product does not seem to be child friendly in my opinion."
1,So heavy that it's dangerous,I bought this for my daughter when she was 2. I agree with the other reviewer about the weight of the product. It is so heavy that it can actually hurt a child if it turns over. I still let my daughter play with it but only when she's being supervised around it. And I have to make sure that the toy is not on any type of unstable ground. There are other good shape sorters out there - I wouldn't waste the money on this one because of the potential safety hazard.
1,Poorly designed,"We bought this toy and returned it as it is poorly designed. Because it is tall and narrow, once a few blocks are in it, it is nearly impossible to get any of the shapes in the lowest holes as the space inside the building is filled with blocks already. This was a frustrating, not very fun toy for our then 12 month old son."
1,Safety Warning,My daughter received this item as a gift for her first birthday. Although this toy is very interesting the many safety concerns for it far exceed the educational value. Aside from it being very heavy and having sharp edges due to the metal components. One of the doors broke off and the hinge for the door is a very small pin which was picked up by my daughter. Luckily I was with her when she was playing with it and was able to immediately get the pin from her. I am in the process of notifying Battat Inc. of this concern but to date I have not received a response from them.
2,Difficult to read owing to the need for rhymes,"I have been a reader of this text for years, typically the C.S. Nott translation (prose style).In comparison, I find this text quite difficult to ""get into"", what with the problem ofrhyming Persian poetry in English. In Persian, the majority of words rhyme, either intheir dominant vowels or their endings, because of the way the language isconstructed. Since English does not have this, there are far fewer rhymes available,and so trying to duplicate the Persian leads to either changes in the meaning, orchanges in the phraseology. For those who want to read the insights contained inthis book, I highly recommend a prose translation."
4,Lost in translation?,"A lot can be learned by these wise and not-so-wise birds.It is great that this classic is available in English. However, the insistence on rhyming means that the sentence construction and choice of words sometimes comes across as clumsy.I wish there was a non-rhyming version.(Maybe there is?)"
1,Played one DVD before dying,"Our Mintek MDP-1810 portable DVD player played one DVD before it died. The motor started making strange rubbing noises, and the display started blinking.The one DVD it managed to play sure looked good -- the picture was sharp, and contrast and color were terrific. I just wish it still worked. Its replacement will come from a more reputable manufacturer."
1,Oh Dear!!,"I'll definitely be sticking with Brand names from now on. I've used this unit 3 times and now it won't load the DVD. That's nearly $200 down the drain. To it's credit, when it worked it was great. Good picture and good sound. I only wish I had seen the reviews on this product first as I'd never have bought it."
1,Player is unreliable - do not buy!,"The player does not always load the DVD's. And it never fails that part way during the movie, it will stop playing, get stuck on a scene, and never start again. It is completely unreliable. Sadly, I did not start having serious problems with it until after the warranty was up. I've only had it 6 months and it is very frustrating that it was such a waste of money."
2,Important info if you want to use this product abroad,"I bought this player elsewhere for a trip to the UK and had to return it same day - the transformer is 110v-120v only so you can't recharge the battery in Europe where the voltage is 220-240v. Not all brands are the same. I found the same problem on an Audiovox model but the Apex model I looked at was Ok 110-240v.If it is important to you to be able to use the product abroad I would recommend checking each product before you buy (although Amazon does not currently seem to give this info in their technical specs).P.S. the rating is arbitrary, I didn't get further than a quick look at the player - seemed ok although the motor was a bit noisy."
1,Avoid this player at all cost,"I purchased this player from Costco and had to return it twice. The first time, it plays only on a certain DVD and does not play on some DVDs, even original DVD, not DVD-R. The second time, the player would not charge up the battery.I was interested in the 8'' screen, and for the price, this is a piece of crap."
2,boring,"this cd was pretty disappointing to me. after 3 amazing albums in a row, the departure of guitarist dave clearly left the band in a pretty bad spot because these songs all sound the same. they arent unique and frankly it could possibly be their worst album all together."
3,Ho Hum,"I'm not a huge fan of Sum 41, but I do like this edgy punk rock sound. When I bought this CD, alot of the tracks seemed to mesh together, without a clear break. The 1st song appears to be the best track. If you're debating, I would suggest taking another listen on this site or at your local book store. This CD wasn't bad, but it proves the point that newer doesn't always mean better."
5,They did well,"Finally time to review this album after giving it a week of listening. Obviously, I was super stoked when this came out. Certainly one of my favorite bands, Sum 41 is on that short list of bands that got better as they got harder. Here, it isn't quite as hard as some of their other stuff, but still very enjoyable none the less. They still have the ripping fast choruses which I love. The ballad ""Without you"" is nothing short of amazing. I heard it was way too poppy at first but that itsn't entirely true. Sum 41 still rule the music world in my books"
3,Disappointing,"Disappointing...This is Sum 41's fifth studio album and the band has changed over the years. Since the release of ""Chuck"", the band seems to be taking a much more serious tone. Which disappoints old school fans such as myself. Just about every song on this album has a slow feel to it. You'll be hearing a lot of acoustic guitars and slow tones. Sadly, it seems money has finally become and issue. The album feels like another band performed it. I love Sum 41 for the unique feel they have from every other mainstream band, but it seems they lost it. Now don't get me wrong, this album isn't a complete disaster. For the most part the songs are catchy and memorable. The lost of their lead guitarist doesn't help matters. For some reason, they refuse to replace him. I think it's hurting the band. Anyway, if you buy this album I guess you'll get your money's worth. But for some hardcore Sum 41 fans, I believe you'll be disappointed."
2,Dissapointed,"I thought that Sum 41 would come out with at least a decent CD, but man I was sooo wrong. The CD was no fun! It was alot of boring slow songs. Sometimes those are nice if there is something to them... sadly there wasn't. The faster songs they had weren't even that original. They were the same old anthems that the pop-rock bands have been playing for years. C'mon Sum you had a really good CD last time! Please don't let me down again!"
2,Same Old Same Old,"Ok I don't understand the praise for this album. The songs are actually boring except for The Jester, March Of The Dogs and King of The Contradiction. I consider their last album Chuck to be their finest moment as the songs were more serious and alot heavier in message as well.On this album they seem to have slipped back into the sound from their previous days which I thought was ok. They sound like Green Day and Blink 182 which isnt a good thing as those arent really GREAT Punk Rock bands. The songs are long as well, longer than usual for Sum 41 and the ideas arent really there.I know this seems like a plug to diss this album but really folks its not that great"
2,Complete retread,"This is a pale, insipid version of Green Day's American Idiot (and other Green Day songs). Sum 41 chose some good material to rip off, then did nothing more than a poor cover. Absolute garbage. Go listen to Green Day and hear the obvious inspiration for this album."
1,Sloppy Stitching and Badly Shaped,I was so disappointed when the tea set arrived. The stitching was so sloppy and poorly done. The items were so badly shaped and I had to manipulate every piece to make it presentable including the basket. Even so all the parts still look so sloppy and poor poor quality. The plastic tubing around the handles makes it look cheap. You could not see this detail online. I did not like the hidden zipper that has no purpose except for the ability to have the basket embroidered. It was too late to return. I would never buy this product again.
1,Big Waste of Money,"This guide doesn't help with anything! For most of the game it just tells you how to walk through an area (sometimes it even misprints this) but you'll miss all kinds of cool items, fights, and bonus happenings if you use it. You need help with the stardusts? Someplace online will help more than this guide. Need help with boss battles? This guide would be your worst choice. Choose wisely, don't buy it."
2,To be blunt; this guide is bad.,"I literally can't even write a full length review on this guide, because it isn't even a full length guide.It's 112 pages. That's the biggest red flag.Beyond that it's ""side quest"" section is just a chart stating where the quest is, what you do, and what the reward is. There is literally NO depth to it whatsoever, even for the more complicated side quests.It's actually kind of funny how bad this guide is, considering in the ""stardust chart"" (Yup, another chart) it has 4 screen shots under it depicting the ""harder to find"" locations and literally right next to each other are two of the EXACT SAME pictures. Like, nothing is different. Same picture twice, within an inch of each other.This was obviously a pretty rushed guide for Prima and a lot of effort wasn't really put into it. You'd be better off looking up all your information online. Seriously."
2,a better choice,"This is a live album and as with most live albums the production quality is very poor compared to a studio album. My first Baron rojo album was Volumen Brutal, which is excellent and much heavier and faster than Siempre Estais Alli. I am awaiting my copy of Metalmorphosis from Amozon before I decide to purchase other Baron Rojo CDs. Basically I don't recommend this CD unless you are a hardcore Baron Rojo fan and like live albums with poor production. For those considering buying their first Baron Rojo CD I would highly recommend Volumen Brutal."
1,LIES! Product description wrong!,"As you can see the description says Laminated Steel Pin Tumbler Padlock, Blue.The technical details at the time of this review were this:Technical Details1: Colorful, outdoor protection - blue cover2: High-tech thermoplastic shell designed to withstand the elements3: Hardened steel shackle with molded cover4: Matching colored keyhead for added convenience5: 1-9/16"" (40mm) wide laminated steel body, 2"" (51mm) shackleIN ACTUALITY THIS IS WHAT YOU WILL GET:1: The description of this is accurate2: The description of this is accurate3: The hardened steel shackle with molded cover DOES NOT EXIST there is no black cover on the shackle4: Matching colored keyhead for added convenience is also not true. Just your standard brass colored key. The blue plastic cover on the key DOES NOT EXIST.5: The description of this is accurateUPDATE: 1 YEAR LATER. THE TUMBLER INSIDE THE LOCK HAS COMPLETELY RUSTED MAKING IT INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO LOCK. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT TRUST ME ON THIS."
3,"It is was I was expecting, but...","I wanted a waterproof master lock for my shed outside and I have been having a hard time finding them in stores around me so I decided to look on Amazon. I saw this one and thought it looked really cool, but it didn't have good reviews so I read them before I made a decision. The reviews said the lock did not come with the blue plastic piece on the key or the black cover over the lock and that is true. So I knew that I was not going to get either of those things, but as long as the rest of the lock was correct, I did not care. So the only reason I am giving this 3 stars is because the description is incorrect. Other than that the lock works and looks great."
2,"They are large, but poor quality","These are certainly large wash cloths, but the quality is small. I'm sure I can find a use for them, maybe cleaning the shower rather than using for a shower."
4,Work great to wash your back,After reading the other reviews for these wash cloths I decided to purchase a few. I like them. I think the quality is average. I have some standard wash cloths that are thicker and some that are thinner. These seem to fall in between a thin wash cloth and a thick fluffy wash cloth. I don't find them to be any coarser than other wash cloths but I don't have sensitive skin. I bought them because I had a hard time washing my back with standard wash cloths. For that task they are great and they work just as well on the rest of my body. I don't use them on my face but then I don't use any wash cloth on my face.
2,Just okay,I initially enjoyed the flexability of having different types of exercise. I got the version for my computer and had too many problems with it skipping or stopping. I eventually stopped using it and use P90x now.
4,Excellent personal trainer,"If you're lacking a gym, hate sterile workouts that leave you plateaued, and need dynamic workouts - let this little number help you out. What a great program - your personal trainer adjusts to your abilities, the sound track is fine, the exercises are fun, and there are so many options to go along with it.The diet planning section is a little weak, though I never attempted to truly make use of it. You DO get tired of the exercises after repetition, so a little more variety would have been useful.That said, this is far better than a book or video, could even be better than a pass to the gym."
1,Save your money,"The concept of the software is great, but I have yet to complete a workout running the PC version on Windows XP without the software crashing. Going by the comments on the support website, this type of problem has been unresolved at least since 2004. A very disappointing purchase."
2,Don't do it!,As a lover of Christian music this music is a little behind the times. It has an out dated feel. Not worth the money for sure!
5,Thank You,"Thank you so much for making this gospel CD. It's so uplifiting and I love the cut ""Praise Him"" it really gets me going. I also enjoyed your interview with Brother Gerard Henry a couple weeks back on BET. Congratulations on your new arrival and your marriage. May the blessings of the Lord continue to be upon you and your family and give us another GOSPEL uplifting CD real soon."
2,"Poor quality, but looks nice until they break.","I prefer to purchse the smallest CZs because they tend to look more realistic than larger stones. I ordered 2 pair, because i tend to lose earrings, which is why I don't buy ""the real thing"". The settings are really flimsy. The CZ was not well attached in the setting. Of the four earrings received, one CZ had already fallen out before delivery, and one was at an angle. I reset them using tweezers and a magnifying glass.Basically, with this product you get what you pay for. I would recommend going up a notch in price and getting a more solid setting rather than the 4-prong setting in very thin gold that these earrings come with. It gets two stars, because even for a somewhat low price, you are not quite getting what you pay for. They should at least hold together."
4,brutal death/grind!!,"this band is killer!you need this cd if you like suffocation,malignancy,disavowed,sepsism,devourment and other brutal death/grind bands."
2,Summer Pleasures-Not entirely a pleasure,"I am a devoted Nora Roberts fan, and upon discovering this book, I was overjoyed and couldn't wait to read it. I read the back of the book and was convinced that it would be great.However, when I came home and began reading, I realized something was wrong. The plots wereweak and I did not get into the stories easily. There was no chemistry between the four couples, and hardly any romance that I have come to expect from Mrs. Roberts. I could not relate to the characters, as I usually can.The last story ended so quickly, it was as if she had just scribbled those last few paragraphs on the way to the mailbox to mail it to her publisher.I hope that Mrs. Roberts writes a more substantial book."
3,3 1/2 stars for me it was ok not a big WOW for me,"The storyline was pretty good and easy to read, but the mistakes were very distracting. I found the large amount of grammatical and punctation errors very disappointing for such a large publishing company.Apart from that it was ok i mean it wasn't love at first sight with the book , felt like it was missing something it was just ok...."
4,Resoved the Issue,I did not receive this book.....I got the wrapper in the mail empty and the seller resolved the issue very nicely. I would buy from her in the future.
2,Awful,"I have been so excited that Nora Roberts is re-publishing her old (and hard to find) books. I was especially excited because this was a 2-in-1 deal. However, after reading both stories I was VERY disappointed. Both plots were weak and the characters were even weaker. It was like Roberts just didn't care what she is writing about. Definately not her usual style. I suggest that you do not buy this novel and instead look into her other series."
4,Two for the price of one...,SUMMER PLEASURES by Nora Roberts is really two romance stories for the price of one. And what SPLENDED stories they are!My favorite was ONE SUMMER. I enjoyed the fierce attraction between characters Shade Colbey and Bryan Mitchell. WOW! Now that's entertainment!
3,Not bad - but definitely not great,"Like many other reviewers, I was really excited to see so much of Nora Roberts' backlist being re-released. Though I prefer romantic suspense, I don't mind straight romance for a change of pace. I have many of her other books like the Night Tales, the Stanislaski series and the Stars of Mithra trilogy. I also recently purchased Going Home. All those are much better choices for her books than this. These books didn't seem to have much going for them. They weren't even good romances; they were just average. Neither of the couples had any chemistry (an element which Nora is usually so adept at creating), and more importantly, I just didn't care what happened to the characters. If you are a Nora fan, you might want to check it out of the library. Compulsive collectors might want to buy it to fill out their collection, but otherwise, pick one of her many other and better books."
2,Interesting Story / Bad Romance,"I found Second Nature/One Summer to be one story in the same. Neither differed from the other, and so reading them back to back was like reading the same story twice. I found the narratives boring and the romance lacking."
1,"A HUGEEEEEEEE Beach boys fan, and I threw this dvd away!!!!!!!!!","Thought that this dvd was going to be coolm with jan and dean with the BEACH BOYS!!!!!! NO, total waste of money it actually should be 0 stars!!!!!!!! I threw my copy of this dvd away after watching it only in 20mins!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So many better beach boys dvd's out there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Perquackey Gives Your Brain A Fun Workout!,"I bought Perquackey for my mom for Christmas last year and we love it! We are always looking for new games to play that are fun, challenging, and stimulating to the brain. Perquackey fits the bill on that!It's a simple dice game with a timer where you spell out as many words as you can in 3 minutes. Once you get to 2000 points, then you become ""vulnerable"" and get 3 more dice added to the mix ... but your words have to be longer.The game often goes back and forth as to who's winning and you can even lose your ""vulnerable"" status and points if you don't do well on a round. We both enjoy trying to find the words the other doesn't see. I usually beat my mom at it ... but not always!Perquackey is a fun and fast-paced game that gives your brain a workout while not being tedious. I highly recommend it!"
1,"Excellent Game, Bad Implementation","I played Perquackey as a kid with my parents and loved the game. I purchased this game online for my wife and I and, initially, we had a lot of fun with the game. However, we played the game perhaps a dozen times and the letters were worn the the point of being almost illegible.I do not recommend purchasing Perquackey from this manufacturer.I highly recommend the game and suggest that anyone interested in the game pay the extra for one of the used original games offered on Amazon. Either that, or hit a few antique stores and look for the game used.My wife and I found a used game in outstanding condition, circa 1956, for a little more than we paid for the brand new one from Amazon. The quality of the used game is far superior the new iteration.Seriously, unless you plan on playing the game only 3 or 4 times, save your money. If you are going to play Perquackey regularly, buy a used version."
1,PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE?!,"I agree with game quality issues in full. The craftsmanship is terrible, and I wrote the company about the faded die two years ago. I stated that I would be willing to pay more for quality. I received no response. Perhaps the vintage games of the '50s and or '70s, both of which I played, are better constructed and made to endure the addiction of the game. I note that Perquackey is often sold out. PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE?! Or perhaps low price, high volume, Wal-Martesque. Still, the game, itself, is a fast, portable, fix for Scrabble, is to ""die"" for!"
1,The tiles for this game do not last,"Our prior Perquackey set lasted for years. The lettering on the tiles of this sset are already unsatisfactory--and we only received the set in late January. So i am definitely unhappy with the product.As noted, we have had a Perquackey set for years and enjoy Perquackey very much. So it didn't occur to me that this set wouldn't last more than a month.I will sign this evaluation asDisgruntled Purchaser"
3,Perquackey,"I love the game...it is one I remember from my younger years....but the timer is defective and stops frequently!! I would gladly trade the fancy smancy tin container for a cardboard box and a timer that lets the sand/salt crystals fall through! And because it is not running well not matter what way you turn it, I can't figure out what the real time is!!"
3,Great game; poor craftsmanship,"My family loves Perquacky, and we play it at least once week. Within a month of buying the game, my black cubes were fading or already faded. Tracing over them was problematic. The manufacturer really needs to fix this flaw in craftmanship.Perquacky is good for ages 10 up. The object of the game is to create 3, 4, 5, 6...letter words. Five words per number group, but you don't have to do one group at a time. You can make a 3-letter, then a 6-letter, then a 4-letter...Bonuses are added if you get all your 3 & 4, 4 & 5, 5 & 6,... Very helpful for spelling and vocabulary, and other language skills, especially anagrams (same letters make different words: a-e-l-p-s-t make petals, pastel, staple, pleats, and plates)."
1,Letters Rub Off of Dice Quickly,"We have only had this game less than a month and my wife and her sister love it. Her sister has a very old copy of this game and the dice on that one are still in good shape even though they are many years old.UNFORTUNATELY, THE DICE ARE UNIQUE TO THIS GAME AND THEIR QUALITY OF THIS SET IS VERY POOR WITH THE LETTERS RUBBING OFF OF THEM. THEY ARE ALREADY UNREADABLE. WE HAVE HAD TO USE A MARKER TO WRITE ON THE DICE IN ORDER TO PLAY THE GAME. DID NOT LAST ONE MONTH!VERY POOR QUALITY AND WORKMANSHIP! I wish I had seen other comments talking about this issue before our purchase.I would have rated the fun and educational value both 5's had the dice not been so cheap."
2,Not How I Remembered It,"This was a gift for my sister. I was disappointed because the timer was only 2 minutes (should be 3). The dice were oversized, but the container was too small to really be able to shake the dice. The original game we had was made in the USA - much better!"
2,low quality dice,"It's a great game and we all love playing it, but after only a few days the dice are ugly and mottled and the letters are getting hard to read. The quality of the printing of the letters on the dice is extremely low, so when they are shaken together, the print comes off."
4,A Really Good Word Game,"PERQUACKEY is a family favorite at my house, even though the family has grown up. It's fast and simple, but you do have to know how to spell! Keep a dictionary handy in case words get challenged! You have a cup filed with dice that have letters on them instead of numbers. Another player turns over the timer and someone writes down the words as you use the dice to spell them. Yu have to arrange the dice and spell the words out loud. You keep re-arranging the dice until you run out of time. Longer words are worth more points. If luck gives you good letters you'll have an easy time of it. If you end up with a pile of consonants and one vowel you'll be struggling!"
4,Feedback,Very fast and loved they were in stock. Cant find them at store anymore. Amazon great resource for those hard to find items.
4,"Scale is beautiful, but there is a problem","The scale is very attractive and appears to be quite accurate. However, the numerals are difficult to read. They are a pale yellow and don't show up well. They can't be read at all in a dark room and are difficult to make out in any glare. If the numerals were red, they would be much easier to deal with."
2,Disapppointing....,"I had high hopes for the scale, BUT it has a serious flaw. It is too sensitive to changes in the floor surface to give you an accurate reading. The weight depends on whether the floor is completely flat. So any variation, as is common on tiled bathroom floors, results in a weight variation of up to 10 pounds depending on where the scale is placed."
2,Works great until it fails..,"The scale worked great for the first 3 years of ownership, though I used it very infrequently. It is low profile enough that the bathroom door would pass right over it in the small bath where we kept the scale; great for tight spaces.However, after about 3 years, one day it just began showing dashes accross the display, or numbers counting down from 170 to 150 or so... not the normal weight indications.The units setting button on the back did not do anything either. A new battery produced no difference....So for a short lived scale, its great. However, as something you can leave in the bath and rely on... this product fails.There must be something in the design that is flawed... a plastic component or similar that will break after some age. There is no other way to explain why an electronic scale would fail from nothing more than age and very occasional use."
1,It looks great BUT...,"I never usually write reviews but I thought I needed to with this product.Mine broke after only 6-7 months of very light use. Tried changing the battery but it still wouldn't work. For how much this scale costs, it shouldlast much longer than 7 months. I do agree that the display is difficult to see in low light conditions. After my experience with this scale, I plan on going back to a mechanical one."
4,Great Racing Game For Real Racing Fans...,"This is my favorite XBox Live Game and has plenty of variety to keep you interested and custom soundtracks are awesome mixing in the DJ's of each country with your own tracks is completely refreshing. The graphics surpass Gran Turismo 3's cut scenes and this game is ""playing"" like this. Recommend!"
3,Too hard to control the cars,"I know, I am not the best race game player in the world, but come on. While there is Need For Speed Underground out there why should I buy this one?The cars are too hard to control at the turns, you end up hitting the walls, etc and plus you have this annoying Boingg!! sound. There is a huge selection of cars and you need to earn Kudos (tokens) to unlock some of them.I definitely recommend NFS Underground, but if you believe you can control these cars, go ahead buy it."
3,"Not bad, but there is a better racing out than this!",I played TOCA Race Driver 2 and it tops any racing game I've ever played. It has everything. Check it out. Gotham has too much sliding going on. I shouldn't be sliding all over the place when I'm only driving 50mph! And why do you fly around like a feather when you get hit from behind all the time? That's all the computer does is hit you from behind on a turn and you go spinning like a bottle. That's not real. GO get TOCA RD2
2,Don't believe the hype !!,"First of all, I just purchased this game because I was wanting a racing game for my XBOX. Let me start by saying, the only reason I gave this game 2 stars in the overall rating is because the graphics are great. The game looks really nice, but the controls are absolutely horrible. Miserable in fact. When I sit down to play a racing game, or any other game for that matter, it should not take so much effort to get your car to steer and handle turns, slides, etc. The controls are miserable, and I found the game making me angry. I am selling this game asap and getting something else worth my time. I highly recommend NOT buying this game. A huge waste of time and money. I love XBOX, but give me Super Mario Kart anyday. At least you can control that game without losing your mind, and you can have fun with it. Unlike PGR2. Don't buy it. Trust me."
4,Finally a Gran Turismo for the Xbox - with multiplayer!,"First the good news: you finally get rewarded for driving a good line. All us Gran Turismo 3 drivers used to be mighty confused about being rewarded for sliding through a turn when a well-executed line is faster and more elegant! So now you can slide, or nail the apex, and still get points. (You still get more for sliding though.)It's a great racing game. The physics are good, and the vehicles respond as you'd expect them to. The AI is much better than the GT3 AI.It's easier to unlock new cars, and you pay for them with Kudos tokens, rather than virtual money. You cannot upgrade the cars as you could in GT3, and I will miss that.Playing against others is fun, just mute some of the trash talkers - or beat them."
4,"It's not Gran Tourismo, but it's not bad","I have to say, PGR 2 really took my breath away in a way I was not at all expecting. It is far better than the first PGR and finally gives the Xbox something (almost) comparable to Gran Tourismo. Gran Tourismo still touts PGR 2 for realism, but PGR offers online play and beautiful graphics, as well as the added fun factor of Kudos. For any racing fan who owns an xbox, do not hesitate to buy this game. While it doesn't offer any of the vehicle customization options as found in the GT series, it still showcases a wide variety of cars that are a blast to drive, all with their own feel and sound. The sounds in PGR 2 are a true treasure, every car and every type of terrain (from cobble stones to grass) has a perfect and unique sound. At a price of 30 bucks, this game is a must have."
1,did not work,"This was a Christmas gift to an Autistic child who really wanted this game for Christmas, but when I order it and had it send to him ( he lives in a different city then I) I found out later that the game did not work. He was disappointed and so was I. I contacted the seller regarding the game to see if we could exchange it or get a refund. The seller did not wanted to honor the return or exchange after a few email exchange I gave up..it's just not worth my time I when out to the store and bought him the same Game but this time if it doesn't work I have a receipt and a physical store to go back if it doesn't work. But it works great and he LOVES it!!! Shame on any sellers who do not honor the return policy."
4,Not as good as the first.,"I bought this one expecting it to be better than the first, and the detail of the cars and tracks is better, but the overall game doesn't do it justice. Now i know why forza one the battle."
5,LOVE this game...,"This game turned me on to racing games. I love it, and the newer versions don't really do much more for me than this one. The music was great for it, too."
3,Forza Motorsport vs. Project Gotham Racing 2,"I bought this game because it was supposed to be better than Forza Motorsport, which I already played and liked, and I only had an xbox. I would have bought Forza Motorsport 2 if it were on xbox. The game has a pretty good array of cars but the game is more to complete challenges than to race. For example, the challenges that you have to complete are street race, one on one, cone challenge, hot lap,overtake, and speed camera. The races are only 5-10 minutes long if that. The goal is to get points doing different stunts like sliding. The courses are all in cities and you can't go off the road. The damage you take throughout the race does not effect your driving it only effects how many points you get. In conclusion I would rather have Forza than PGR 2."
1,SoOoOo BoRinG!,"This game is just race and get new cars. One of the most boring games ever. Flashy cars, great graphics, but no interesting features what so ever. I have Project Gotham 1 and 2. I got bored of them after 2 days. Take my advice, theres better games out there! Later."
4,this game sucks,When u first start playing the game its good but the controls r terrible u try and turn a small corner and u have to slow down so much then the computer racers by-pace u.what im trying to say is that u need to buy a $70.00 steering wheel for the xbox which i did not do because why do they make u get all these accesories that cost a lot of money.but one thing that i like about this game is there r ferrari enzo's.three words this game sucks.i would sell it but my mom dosent allow me to sell stuff what a load of crap.
4,great racing,I am hooked on this game. Throttle stearing hard braking and exotic locations what else could you want.
1,Sluggish control,"I did not enjoy this game. Compared to a game such as Need for Speed - Most Wanted, it's controls were sluggish and the graphics inferior. I purchased this game for a few bucks at Amazon and sold it for about the same a few weeks later."
4,The #1 Racing Game In XBOX History,I think this game is the best game I have ever played. The first time I played this game I thaught it was the best game ever. The more you play this game the better it gets.
5,Top notch game,"Project Gotham 2 is outstanding in every way. It looks and plays great, and the difficulty is adjustable so nothing will overwhelm even the fleeting gamer. A must buy."
3,One and Done,"Literally the children hurriedly excavated out the stones and have never even mentioned getting another one of these. The gems themselves are pretty small, as you'd expect, and the whole project's size is less than six inches on a side. and maybe 2 1/2 inches thick. If you understand these specifications and realize you can't reuse this and the gems are not much to look at then this can be a one time educational tool for children up to at least ten years old."
2,No Crystals,"I bought this kit for my son's birthday. He is really into crystals and thought this would be fun and educational.He was pretty excited when he opened this present he started digging into it right away.He worked really hard to expose the first item only to be disappointed as it was only 'a rock'Turns out this 'crystal' mining kit was packaged with a brick that should have been put into the 'gold mining' kit.All of the accessories were in the kit, they seemed of decent quality. My son is looking forward to getting a real crystal mining kit soon, hopefully amazon will make this right."
4,Fun project,My seven year old had a lot of fun with this - it kept him busy for at least an hour. The 'mining tool' they give you is kind of weak - after about fifteen minutes i gave him a flat-tip screw driver and an ultralight mallet from the camper and he went to town on the little chunk of clay.
5,Kids had a blast,"Took a while to get started, but like someone else suggested I poured water on it and that made things a lot easier on them. There were exactly 8 in each kit, very nice quality, good sized stones. They really loved it once they found the first stone, and it didn't take long after that to get them all out since they were grouped together. They've been carrying the cards around checking them out with magnifying glasses. I had 2 cheap loose gemstones that I gave each of them for the ninth spot on the card as an example of a cut stone, so they have a before and after. For an almost 6 year old and a 7 year old it was a lot of fun."
3,Maybe for a younger kid,"Went pretty quick with my 8yr old son. He liked the rocks but it didn't entertain him for very long. He made short order of the powdery ""dirt"" type brick. Maybe better for a smaller child..?"
5,My daughter loved this!,"Took my daughter several evenings at the kitchen table to get these all out (she's 9). We had a couple close meltdowns because ""she just wanted them out!"" But as mom, I appreciated that this was one gift she wouldn't be done with in 5 minutes. In the beginning she was very careful & methodical in getting these out, by the 3rd night she was just chopping at it. In the end she was very happy with this & she took them to school to show off. We even ended up with 2 bonus mini crystals!"
4,Not a bad purchase,"My 10 year old really liked ""mining"" for these crystals. She did not attempt to get all the crystals out of the block in one setting. She did a little bit of chipping away of the block, whenever she felt like it. I actually found myself chipping away at it a time or two, it was thrapeutic for me:>. Once you see a piece of a crystal it's exciting. I'm going to look for a more challenging one for her this year. I recommend this, but you must have patience."
4,Mining Kit,"My 12 year old worked for hours on this kit. I guess he could have just smashed them open, but using the tools provided it took him a couple days to get all the gems. I'm glad I made him go outside the open them.....there was dust everywhere!"
5,Messy fun for all ages,I bought this for my 12 year old son for Christmas and he had so much fun with it. He has always loved digging for rocks and gems and it just so happened his science project for school was doing the exact same thing. He was anxious to take the gems to school and show his science teacher. It is a bit messy with the sand going everywhere so make sure you have something under it while they break it apart to catch the sand. My 5 year old daughter enjoyed looking for them as well. He has asked for more now that he found all the gems in it.
4,This was fun,"It took a long time to excavate the crystals. But we probably should have done it over a couple of days rather than looking at it as an activity for a day. The dust got all over, The kids did enjoy it but it too long for their attention span."
4,Very helpful for CDA,"Though at times the language gets a little dense--for one thing, way too many parenthetical expressions--this is a great text for understanding CDA better. Also touches on social movement rhetoric."
3,Grid - Music For Dancing,"A nice collection of different remixes of The Grid from their first three albums. And while there's little to find fault with in terms of the music itself, I do wish they'd included a few more mixes done by other people, as the Grid's own mixes tended to be merely extended dance versions. Where's the Brian Eno mix of ""Heartbeat""? Or the Orb mix of ""Crystal Clear""? Minor quibble, obviously -- the album is still plenty enjoyable, with the Andrew Weatherall mix of ""Floatation"" and Global Communication mix of ""Rollercoaster"" as the standouts."
4,Kicka** alpha heroine + sweet love story,"This sci-fi action romance is fun to read:Pros -- this ones going on my alpha heroine bookshelf , which I love to fill- hero is stoic, cold and scary when he's not being dense- Regan, the kidlet is adorable- did I mention that the h kicks a**?- I loved that even though the h is so strong, she isn't afraid to wear her heart on her sleeve for the H or risk everything to help him- the attraction between them and the H/h's motivations are drawn out wellCons-- the H had very little to do in the book, he was more passive than active except in the climax where he saves everyone- the H seems to be always running away; after a while it was just irritating. I was like stay or leave but do it already.- the h was just too strong, all round perfect, her only vulnerability was her love for the HOverall, its a fun enjoyable and quick read!"
4,Love this genre!,"I love this futuristic/sci-fi romance genre! This was a great plot, and Mea and Seth are great characters. Mea is The Huntress (sort of like a bounty hunter in outer space), and Seth is the hunted (an escaped convict). I would have given it 5 stars if the author had done a little bit more with the plot. It could have been developed so much more and even had a sequel.I felt like the author only skimmed the surface."
1,Badly ghosted picture,"I ordered these to work with a manual KVM switch. Video ghosted very badly using these cables. I know it's not the switch box because I've hooked up cables from a Tripp-Lite electronic switch I previously ordered and they do not ghost, neither on the electronic or manual switch. If you're using a manual KVM switch box avoid these."
4,"Nice jewelry, poor necklace",The pendant and earrings were beautiful but the necklace(cheap fake leather cord) left little to be desired. Had to purchase a separate necklace.
2,Difficult to Read,"I find this book very difficult to read and probably will notfinish it. The subject matter and the reviews fascinated me, butthe actual reading of the book is very hard work. This is notlike reading something by Richard Dawkins or Stephen Jay Gould.This is like reading a college text book.People sometimes believe that because a book is hard to read andunderstand that the author is expressing deep and complex ideas.Sometimes that may be true, but it is more often true that theauthor is just not that good at expressing himself in an easy tounderstand way.Obviously I am in the minority here, because most of the otherreviews gave this book 5 stars. It was some of the otherreviews that caused me to buy the book, but the truth is that Igot more from reading the reviews than I have gotten from thebook so far."
4,evolutionism and functionalism,"This is an interesting combination of the biological evolutionary theory of group selection with a revisited form of sociological functionalism. It is well argued and well written and it provides an alternative/ complement to individual and gene theories of natural selection, on the biological side, and to cognitive approaches to religion, on the anthropological side."
4,Excellent book,"This book was very insightful and defiantly made me think about things a bit different after reading it. Highly recommend if you are interested in sciences and not so big on religion, but even if you are big on religion it doesn't desecrate religion either, just tries to explain pieces of it and does so very well"
3,"darwin's cathedral: evolution, religion, and the nature of s","this scholarly look at the social, cultural and religious implications of evolution gives the reader some insights and connections of one science to another but never arrives at any conclusion or view of where to go next. the one thing for sure is that the author has an ego."
2,Hallmark 1959 Chevrolet El Camino Keepsake Ornament,"Cheap in quality. I collect these for my husband every year and this is the only only made out of plastic, the rest are made of good quality and from metal. Seller was great and got it to me in a very timely manner. The ornament is not one I would buy again."
3,KKSF #17 Sampler,Didn't like this disc as well as some of the other samplers but true KKSF fans wont be disappointed....definitely worth having if you are collecting all the samplers.....
4,ALL BUYERS BEWARE!! DOES NOT SHIP COMPLETE,I purchased this set through Amazon.com. It states that it includes the princess and carriage as well as the king and queen and the knight and his horse. The only thing sent with the order was the princess and carriage. When I contacted Amazon they explained this is from a third party fulfilled by amazon shipping but they could not replace the product. SO BEWARE. THIS SET DOES NOT SHIP COMPLETE!!! YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE THE KING AND QUEEN OR THE KNIGHT AND HIS HORSE. Amazon was great as always and has refunded my money.
1,WCW Mayhem,By far the worst WCW video ever made. There was not point in publishing this video. Many of the matches weren't even shown it entirely. The only good part about this video was that i was only 1 hour long.
1,False advertising,This is not wcw mayhem 99. this video sucks. Half the matches are cut and paste. WCW Mayhem 99 was a pay per view not a compilation of matches.
3,Hulk Hogan Didn't Create WCW,"What bothers me about this tape is that they make hulk hogan or hollywood hogan the face of wcw. Well he's not, guys like Ric Flair, Sting, Lex Luger made wcw great to watch for a while. Look im a hulk hogan fan but im always going to remember him for what he did in the wwe. But if you like to see hogan career in wcw i'd buy this tape it does have some great matches with Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, Sting, and Goldberg. So if you like hulk hogan in wcw buy it i hope you like it."
2,"Best of Hogan, Not Nitro","I will keep this straight forward and to the point. The only positive aspect of this video is it does have old footage of WCW Nitro. You can not really see this stuff anymore unless you recorded it yourself back in the day. However, this whole video is about Hogan. Hulkster or Hollywood, every match has Hogan, so really this is not the best of Nitro, since Hogan slowed matches down anyway. Hogan is the man, but not right in this Nitro collection. The tape covers Hogan from 94 to early 99. If you like the Hulk then get this, but again, not even close to being a best of Nitro video. None of the matches shown were very well done, even if it was a championship match. I wish it was better, but it is not a good example of the great matches from Nitro. **"
2,Poor quality,"Made sloppily. Does not hang straight. If you are going to manufacture 1000's of these, you could at least do it right. This is not rocket science."
3,Does its job,"It does its job, but is a bit flimsy. I would definitely recommend some of those reinforcer things to keep this attached to the pegboard. When you go to pull out a screwdriver, the whole thing can get wobbly/try to pull off the wall."
3,"Nice Effort, But Not the Best Quality","I really enjoyed the string arrangements created for this album, but I would not be honest if I did not mention that the musicians who performed on this CD were not completely on the ball. There are a few spots in which the violin is out of tune. Also, the background effects music can get a little annoying. If you are truly into Tori's music and want to hear something with a new ""twist"" on it, then this will probably make the fix."
1,Market driven tripe,"Take Tori's music, subtract the power of the lyrics, subtract the passion. What are you left with? Mediocre string performances which sound dead and uninspiring.The marketeer who named this a ""tribute"" knew nothing about what draws people to Tori's music, and was thinking of the definition meaning ""collecting money"".I doubt Tori herself would have allowed the release of this if she had any control over it."
2,Nice try...,"Usually I like what string quartets can do with pop & rock music ie Rachel Barton's rock album and Apocalyptica. This tribute wanted to be good but lacks feeling in all the tracks except for ""Pretty Good Year"", which was beautifully done. There are some sonic redeeming qualities, especially the intro to ""Precious Things"" but most tracks seem rushed. These artists could have taken more chances with the music. If you're looking for Tori, she's not here. If you don't know Tori's stuff, this is an interesting strings excercise."
1,Not a precious thing...,"Being an admirer of Tori Amos, I was anxious what this cd would sound like. Only after a few seconds of some songs I crucified this cd and cried... well, not exactly cried, but I'm very, very disappointed. I can't imagine that Tori was fully aware how her songs were raped blown to pieces. None of the songs are close to the originals, not even bad live tracks. Where Tori keeps impressing me with her beautiful songs, fragile lyrics and where one kan hear the love for music and wonderful poems, this album is a waist of time, money and effort. Now even my cd player refuses to play this album anymore."
4,Good for the price you are paying.,I purchased this as a gift and installed in on a .17. It installed easily and it works good. The parts feel a litte cheap but for the price it works great. I would recommend this to anyone who has a need for a simple light and laser combo on a small caliber weapon.
2,Not enough power,Had this on and upgraded very soon. The light is not bright enough. The laser does not keep on target.
3,Dekalb pop-punk lives...,"What do you say about a band that sounds like Blink-182, but have been around since before Blink was big? Amazing Transparent Man, or ATM for short, has been together for about 3 years now [I think], and while they have a tendency to sound like the whole goofy pop-punk sound that Blink has popularized in recent times, they've been doing it for a while. This is by far the strongest outing for this Dekalb, IL three-piece. They plow through 8 songs in a little over 20 minutes, and it makes you wonder where the time went. They keep the listener attentive and energized the whole time. Being produced by Mass Giorgini doesn't hurt, as their vocals [both lead and backing] sound absolutely incredible. They also cover the Smoking Popes and Cyndi Lauper and do respectable jobs with each one. If you're looking to get into a new pop-punk band that writes great songs about girls and wears little pink shorts at most of their shows, give ATM a listen."
5,Best U.K. Auto Show,"Got hooked on this quite late in the life of the show but that means a lot of new material from all the seasons. It's the best ""and with that bombshell"" I'm done."
3,"This walkman is not ""handsfree""","This is a great walkman except for the fact that it does not have a clip, or a way to attach it to you. Forget about listening to music and moving around unless you want to carry it in your hand.Otherwise, the sound quality is very good, and the headphones are nice too."
2,sony portable walkman,"this unit did not come with an a/c adapter, and has no clip on it to attach to a belt."
2,Nice product but DREADFUL SERVICE,"Actually this is a good product that I have used for many years, but buying it through Amazon was like HELL: I paid for fast delivery and even when the Amazon tracking system reported that my product arrived, I did not get it until I directly contacted the provider.They said they never got my buying request from Amazon and after that they processed my order. It arrived a month after I bought it.Anyway, it's a good product if you need to energize your body or need help purifying it."
3,Cool game,"This is one of the many hockey games I have and it is very good compared to it's ""demo"" of retro NHL94. I give it 3 stars overall because it's pretty realistic."
2,"""NHL 2006""","I played this game one time and returned it back to the store. The graphics were noticably sloppy at best and looked they they were used in 1994. They also had less modes than NHL 2K6 its main competitor. It isn't worth 29.99 to play this junk. I bought NHL 2K6 after I returned it and it is ten times better. With a worse price than 2k6, NHL 2006 was a major dissapointment."
2,A Whole Year Off to Work on This?,"I'm giving this game two overall stars. Those stars represent graphics and being able to switch rosters around without connecting to the internet. This game severly lacks playability. Graphics aside, you would never know that you were playing hockey. Controls are silly and you never get the feeling of being 'in control' offensively or defensively. Checking (along with all else) rarely results in a turnover making on ice play resemble something closer to PONG rather than hockey. My best advice, go after NHL 2k6 and hook up to the internet or get a AR to download the new roster changes. If you prefer to watch the pretty graphics rather than play, this game is for you, but I really think your time would be better spent at a museum or something. This game is terrible."
1,Way too tiny. Is this a lock for toy soldiers to use?,Pass this by and get a lock with a bigger ring. This one is so teensy it's like threading a needle.
2,Green only,The lock is perfect to use at the gym. Easy to use but this shouldn't be advertised as assorted colors. I purchased two and received two green. Very disappointed in the merchant.
2,Beware,"""Assorted colors"" means that you will get the ugliest color of green that you've ever seen and not the color shown in the picture. 2 stars for being a nice lock."
5,Stu Hunt,"I've had Megan's album for about a year now and it always stays in my ""now playing list"". McCallon is not only a wonderful singer but a prolific songwriter. Her lyrics are intelligent and heartfelt and her melodies are edgy and energetic. My personal favorite is ""Cinderella""--a story-song that most everyone can relate to. If you love being one of the first to discover the ""newest upcoming singer-songwriter"" then you do not want to miss this album!"
3,Eh...,"Not their best. Not their worst. The video as well.You want real, best of- action, pick up ""Bleed Like Me.""This one is for the completists (like me) who are still waiting for a b-sides compilation."
3,Haunting Ghosts,"This story takes place in an antique shop and in old lady`s house name Miss.WatsonThis book is mostly about a 6th grade girl and her best friend,Chris,in an antique shop.But when they have to go to Miss.Watsons mansion they thought she was suspicious.The minute that they ran down the mansion they new that something was wrong.The girl realized that this could be the greatest adventure yet.If they survived.In my opinion I think that other people should read this because it gives you goosebumps.It also freaks me out at first because of Miss.Watson.In my opinion I think that other people should read this book because it gives you goose bumps it also freaks me out at first because of Miss.Watson.I think that other people should read this book because its a good book for kids 10-12I would recommend his book because it is both scary and tight at the same time."
2,tinting,"I ordered and received the rolls of tinting quickly after I ordered them - but when it came time to use them - I have been disappointed related to several of the rolls had been smashed causing creases and I was unable to apply to the windows smoothly because of the creases. Also, although they were in an appropriate size box - 4 of the 7 rolls I received had been opened prior to my receiving them."
2,Too Big & Too Small at the Same Time,"The seat is too small for my 4 month old. His head hangs over the top and his feet hang over the bottom.At the same time, this seat was too big for my normal-sized kitchen sink.If you want your baby immersed in water, do not buy this. While it has the adjustable straps, they do not work and baby is basically laying flat. Just imagine your baby on a pillow with a little dip in the middle for his/her bottom.It is very soft, so if you don't want your baby immersed in water, it could be a good buy. Also, a smaller baby may have better luck with this (mine is 16lbs).Returning this and buying a bath ring."
3,I wasn't comfortable using this to bathe baby,"I was all set to use this with my newborn but then when the time came I chickened out. I just wasn't comfortable squeezing it into my sink or putting it in the tub to bathe him. Just something seemed awkward about it, plus tiny newborns are so hard to bathe anyway, as a first time mom I was just too nervous. I ended up running out and getting the big plastic tub that I was desperately trying to avoid. We got the fisher price whale tub, and love it!!!! Now, with that being said. . . we still use the tuckie duckie too. It sits next to the whale tub on the bathroom floor and we let baby hang out on it before he goes in the tub, when we undress him, and right out of the tub when we wrap him in the towel to dry him off. It works great for us as a staging area before we actually get him in the tub. I am really glad we have it. I can't speak to how it dries/or any mildew smells because it never gets submerged in water."
5,Excellent Flavors,"Lorna Sass does an excellent job of introducing the reader to a diverse variety of flavors and spices. (i.e. hijiki, kombu & wakame) Delicious!"
5,Excellent Cookbook,"Having just entered the realm of cooking with a pressure cooker, and not knowing anything about it, I ordered, ""Great Vegetarian Cooking Under Pressure"", by Lorna Sass.As I have now made four, or five recipes, all I can say is that Lorna's in depth knowledge, and ability to convey that, in a very comprehensive, and easy to understand manner, has made my foray into pressure cooking very satisfying!Any time that I've needed to find the information that I was looking for was easily done, via the index, at the end of the book. Cooking something like, quinoa, which I had never tried before, was an enlightening, and delicious experience. It makes cooking with my pressure cooker (pc) so much fun, that I am always looking forward to my next adventure.Lorna's writing style leaves nothing to question. All of the answers are in there!Thanks, Lorna, and I'll be looking forward to picking up another of your pc cookbooks, soon!"
5,"Buy it if you're looking for delicious, easy recipes using a pressure cooker!","I bought this book three years ago and it stays on the TOP of my Cook Book book shelf. The recipes are so DELICIOUS I've kept trying another and another. Best of all, they are EASY to make! AND if you have any questions or need help, just go to Lorna Sass's website, email her your question and she will answer your questions and help you out PROMPTLY, within the same day, is my experience. Lorna Sass brings ""Old Fashion"" good cookin' and love back on the table!"
5,De-lish!,"We have been cooking and eating our way through this cookbook. The husband has embraced pressure cooking and this cookbook has become his new best friend. As another reviewer said, this Sass lady really knows what she's talking about. The recipes are easy to follow, ingredients easy to find and results?--terrific."
3,Boston Burnt Beans,"I have a Kuhn-Rikon pressure cooker and have made their Boston ""Baked"" Beans with good results. When my Lorna Sass cookbood arrived, I tried making her version. Following her instructions, though, I ended up with beans that were burnt onto the bottom of my cooker and a mess to clean up. The KR booklet tells you to add the molasses, ketchup, etc. after the beans are cooked. The Sass cookbook tells you to do likewise, but then to return the lid after adding the molasses and to bring the pressure back up for a minute. I tried that, but the pressure never built up. Instead, unknowingly, I was burning the beans. I do have a glass-top electric range, but I'm careful to remove the cooker from the heater in order to maintain the correct pressure, so I'm not sure what the problem could have been.Since this was the first recipe I've made from the cookbook, I didn't give it a 1* rating. I'll try a few more and perhaps revise this review if I get better (I hope!) results."
1,Warning for Electric Stove Tops!,"If you have an electric stove top (as I do), you will have work to do to use this cookbook! A pressure cooker requires high heat to bring the pressure up followed by lowered heat to continue cooking. If you have an electric stove top, you know that lowering heat takes time (or necessitates switching burners). On page 12, the author states that ""Since all recipes in this book have been tested on gas burners, you may need to make minor adjustments in the timing."" Perhaps the recipes are worth the effort -- I am not inclined to try. (Between switching burners, using a ""Flame Tamer"", and adjusting the recipes -- as suggested by the author -- any time savings seems lost in complications.)"
2,"Ingredients available in NYC, not in the rest of the world.","Lorna Saas obviously lives in NYC where all the strange, weird, wild, exotic, and downright ridiculous ingredents are readily available at Zabar's and other fancy-schmancy shops.Of most of her recipes that I tried ... they come out goopy. I really only use the front cover for reference on how to cook vegetables."
4,pressure cook,The book was a Christmas gift for my nephew. I flipped thri it first and the recipes seemed straight forward-a nutritious way to cook. Instructions were uncomplicated; ingredients not too exotic.Would recommend to others.
5,Delectable!!,"I've had the marvelous opportunity to taste Lorna Sass' cooking--cooked by Lorna herself. And, based upon that sublime experience, I will be buying this book! Pressure cooking? Who would've thought? (Not I.) Yet, as a vegetarian, I see this as a wonderfully effective way to cook delicious, nutritious, interesting meals. And Lorna Sass IS, indeed, the authority in the field."
5,20 year vegetarian and working mother delighted with this cookbook,"How about coming home from soccer practice after work with three hungry family members and create a healthy, homemade vegetarian dinner quickly that gets plenty of compliments. I've been amazed at the variety and taste of the many meals I have made from this book with my pressure cooker. I recommend this book without reservation to all working mothers and fathers!!!"
5,"Easy, nutritious vegetarian recipes","I purchased a pressure cooker and this cookbook just over a month ago. I had never used a pressure cooker previously, nor seen one used.This book demystified the pressure cooker and I have also found the recipes to be varied and interesting. I have made at least six recipes involving grains, beans, and vegetables and have been very pleased with the results. I like to cook after I get home from work and the recipes are great for that.I love the variety of ingredients and types of meals featured in the book. I expect I will establish a repertoire of ""regulars"" for which which I keep ingredients on hand, and also keep trying new things in the book for some time to come.I highly recommend this book for vegetarians who would like to do more cooking at home.NOTE: almost all recipes in this book are vegan. The only references to dairy I've seen are for optional garnishes, for which there are usually non-dairy substitutes readily available if you do not eat dairy."
5,Highly recommended.,"Lorna Sass is the queen of pressure cooking. When I became a vegan about a year ago I became a little overwhelmed with the prep work it takes to truly make tasty, healthy food. After buying a pressure cooker I needed a guide. Lorna Sass tells you everything you need to know to cook vegan or vegetarian in a pressure cooker. The book includes handy charts with cooking times for various grains and beans and vegetables. So even if you aren't making one of the recipes (which are great) the book is a great reference for just the things a vegan/vegetarian would need. No lengthy pages dedicated to meats when that's not what I need. My pressure cooker came with a little cookbook which was basically useless to me because there were only about two recipes in there that were vegan."
4,Who knew?!,"This was really a pleasant surprise as far as creative, delicious recipes. I'm new to pressure cooking and am glad I discovered Lorna, I love her ingredients and bold seasonings.Vegetables are always wonderful and more so when prepared with these recipes."
4,Cheaply but adequately made,"I've bought three of these now. First I got the MDP-5861, which is the widescreen version. It lasted a year, which is not bad considering my then-three-year-old was its biggest user. The screen broke but it still works with an external monitor.I bought another for a friend, and it still works, then I bought the 4:3 (standard screen) 5860 as a replacement.Treat it gently and with a bit of luck it should last a few years. It's not bad for the price."
3,A Solid Product,"I have drug this thing over half the world in the 2 months that I have owned it (Germany, Iraq, Texas) and have had no problems. I take it to the gym and put it on the treadmill for longer runs. The sound quality is not good on the speakers, but I use headphones anyway. The screen does not fold out all the way back, but enough that it can set on the magazine rack of most treadmills/bikes/elliptical machines. Battery life is short--1 movie only--and charger takes only 110 power. Buy the extended life battery although it doubles the cost of the machine."
2,Speakers won't work after 5 months,"A few weeks after I bought it the open button would get stuck so the door wouldn't stay down. It's a reoccurring problem, but so far I've been able to unstick it enough for the door to close... but it's not easy.The speakers just died on it after it was only 5 months old. I do not play it loud, I don't abuse it, & I don't even use it often. AMF, I take good care of my gadgets. The sound from the earphone jack also died at the same time. So it means the audio amp chip inside is blown. Fortunately, I had a high-impedance set of earbuds with a volume control built in the line lying around. I was able to plug it in the audio out in the back of the player to get sound from there.Unfortunately the battery pack covers those output jacks when one is going portable. So the only way I could get sound now, is without the battery."
1,Really bad.,"How this is bad. The singers are the worst part of it. Abba were great singers, these people need to learn how. The males were especially bad."
1,Horrid.,"Not much to say except that it's really bad. I mean bad. I would sell it and try to make back some of the money I spent on it, but I wouldn't wish this thing on anyone else. So I just broke the CD in half."
2,Left Me Wanting,"The subject matter himself is not a worthy topic. While passably well written, the work does not seem to be one which should have been made. It seems that it was written by an academic to fulfill a writing requirement to earn tenure."
4,"Nice, solid locks","Sturdy little locks. Won't stop a pair of boltcutters, but nice, strong little locks will keep your luggage or little lock box secure."
5,Been to Spain Twice...,"...and I used this guide both times. Incredible amounts of information for the budget traveler. I especially appreciate how accurate everything is. The food recommends are great, too.Basically, of the guides I have used before, this is the best for somebody on a budget. Also, this guide seems the best for anybody traveling alone."
5,On a Shoestring,"Whenever you would want to travel on ""a shoestring"" consider this guide. It gives some great suggestions for things to see, places to stay and nice restaurants. All this information is presented in a structured and clear way. Let's go is not afraid to express their own opinion without being biased. It is also great read if you want get some background on Spain and Portugal.The big question at hand of course is if it beats the Lonely Planet and other budget guides. I feel this is something of personal preference. The information in the guide is not that different from one of the other guides but the way they structure it is different. An advantage of the Let's go is that it seems to somewhat less popular than the Lonely Planet.Therefore you run less of a risk that this ""special place"" that is mentioned somewhere in the guide is crowded with other travelers that bought the same guide."
3,Discovery,This book takes you on many mind provocutive inverts. You may discover your self in the many illustrations tripp gives. Religous and historical factods are used to assist the reader to better understand our homosexual feelings. It is a must read for those trapped in the closet and to scared to let their personallity shine. JBH
5,A Celebration of American Photojournalism,"More than just a good-looking coffee table book, and much more than simply a book of sports photography, this is a celebration of American photojournalism in the last half of the 20th century. When I first leafed through it, I was amazed at how many iconic photographs were taken by just one man. Leifer has a gift, and we are fortunate that he is willing and able to share it with us. Highly recommended."
5,A Classic of Sports Photography,"If you enjoy classic sports or are a photography buff this book is a ""must have"". It is well written and the images are incredible. Neil Leifer has seen so many of the great sports events of our generation and his images truly are amazing. It is one thing to attend an event and another entirely to tell the story with photos."
2,"Alright book, but quality issues with the Kindle Content","I purchased this book through Kindle as I had been looking for this book in my local stores. I even paid a higher price to an online retailer for the delivery of the print edition. Finally I found this online edition and I was quite excited to have found this book online.However, while the book is ok, and there are no issues with the concept and the narration, the Kindle edition has quality issues, typo issues etc. Many times the sentence would just end abruptly. Typographical issues are the most common. It looks more like a word document has been converted into Kindle edition with some online converter.This is my second book from the same author( first one was a print edition). I did not expect Kindle edition to have such issues."
1,This Kindle conversion will give you a headache!!,"I have not seen a hard copy of this publication so I don't know if this is just a very poor conversion to the Kindle format or not. The many miss-spellings and rambling verbiage coupled with a seemingly infinite number of hyphenated words (5 to 10 per page) makes reading this work as much fun and pointless as digging random holes in your back yard.My level of expectation for a $0.99 purchase is low. This ""novel"" failed to meet even that low standard."
3,dragon strike,"Enjoyed the story BUT and a big but, the text on the Kindle was terrible. It was like trying to read a different language at times. Many many words mispelled or incomplete so much that sometimes I had to skip ahead and miss some important passages."
2,truly dreadful formattimg,"It is difficult to assess a text when it is so difficult to read. Missing segments, skewed headings, words run together - it is clear no one bothered to proof the Kindle version. Dreadful"
1,About the Kindle edition,"Don't waste your money on the Kindle edition. This has to be the most poorly edited book I have ever tried to read. Words run together, sentences end without completing, or are chopped together nonsensically. It has the look of an old generation OCR scan that was never proof read. While it is readable, it is only just readable.Very disappointing, Amazon."
2,Extremely poor conversion to Ebook,"While I have seen ebooks with a missing letter here and there, this ebook abounds with missing characters, especially numbers. So much so that it becomes very hard to read. The general plot is interesting, but does suffer from some poor research into the military aspects of the story. If you want the whole story, you will need to buy a hardcopy."
2,"Good Beginning, Ultimately Unsatisfying","Right up until the shooting starts, it's a great book. Beyond that point, too many players are using cards they would no longer have. The authors seem to have forgotten that most US cities came to terms with imminent attack long ago, and that at the end of the threatened scenario one side would still be in a position to offer deals that the other would no longer be in a position to refuse. Militarily spot-on, financially iffy. Beyond a certain point, economics does not play a role in policy decisions at a leadership level. A President that ignored that would not remain President very long."
1,e-books editing,This book has all the essentials of a great political thriller. It is totally spoilt however by the appalling editing. In some places the novel is practically un-readable. Amazon should take note of this and demand more professional input from the publishers. The author will rapidly loose sales through this kind of presentation. e-book Format is not a licence for such sloppy material.
4,cultural history and philosophy collide,"This brief, souvenir-inspired history of kitsch is also an ornate, brooding meditation on memory. In ""trading the life of the memory for its cultural fossil,"" Olalquiaga reveals the origins of Atlantis in popular culture, of snow globes (the earliest said to feature Marie Antoinette with parasol), of aquaria and their folly-like porcelain castles, and notes that both Colette and Eva Peron amassed large collections of glass paperweights. Relating her feelings about a failed love affair and the redemptive qualities of Rodney, a hermit crab trapped inside her favorite paperweight, the writer transcends her anonymous epigram, ""Styles die, only kitsch survives."""
2,The pictures are pretty good,"Been longing for another text that finds an unusual subject, then stretches canonical works of theory to say something about them that seems meaningful till you think about it for 15 seconds? Ever wondered what it would be like to read a book that intersperses the Paris arcades, regurgitated Walter Benjamin, the Crystal Palace, regurgitated Lacan, paperweights, regurgitated Colette's daughter? Here you go. The sheer number of typos suggests the author didn't see fit to do a second draft, or retain the services of a proofreader. The color plates are very pretty, but the book is plain bad, and not in any good (kitschy) way. Stick to Gillo Dorfles for a good book on kitsch."
2,A disappointed Milwaukee fan,"I can't recall how many times I've exclaimed the virtues of Milwaukee products, suffice to say I definately qualify as a HUGE fan! But this one is a lame duck in an otherwise pond of swans. Perhaps it's Milwaukee's ""need"" to manufacture off-shore, or just a poor design, but this attachment makes a three-handed job of what used to require one and requires more maintenance than the items you're trying to maintain!-----------------1) POOR FIT = bits wobble, and we all know how painful that can be ;o)2) POOR DESIGN = attachment is both ungainly and difficult to manuveur intight places -3) OVERPRICED AND UNDERBUILT = This one is tricky: under regular use, Iseriously doubt it would hold up...BUT considering all of the above,how likely would YOU reach for it??? [probably only when you'veforgotten to bring your *good one*].[This review was authored by a chief woodbutcher and seasoned termite and does not reflect the views of [...] in any way]AX~"
4,The Milwaukee 49-22-8510 Right Angle Attachment - very useful,"I got mine as a ""throw in"" with a trade show purchase. In building custom cabinets, I use it constantly. It has proven very durable (if you don't try to blast large holes in framing members with it) and the only complaint with mine is that it exhibits a little more run-out at the point of the bit than it should. I contacted Milwaukee and admonished them for producing such a fine tool only to lack the precision it deserves. Even sent it to them for their observations and response. I got the ""shoulder shrug"" response and the ""well to be competitive, we had to go to China to produce it"". Well, at last check Jacobs was still able to make a quality competitive product right here in the good old USA. Haven't seen a right angle attachment by Jacobs, or that would be the one to have."
5,Its a little gem,"I spend a lot of time making and repairing things for and around the home, workshop and property so this right angle drill attachment has proved to be a very useful, well engineered product. The Units ability to accept Drills, Bits and Socket Bits makes it very useful so much so that it hasn't stayed in my work shop that long as my mates keep borrowing it."
4,"Great tool, solidly built. Slight wobble.","This tool works great for drilling small holes in joists for electrical runs. The handle is very adjustable - great for left- or right-handed people. There is no play in the gears, yet the shaft turns smoothly. The only issue I had is that the quick-change chuck is a bit (no pun intended) off-kilter so that the tip of my speedbore bit traces a small circle when it's spinning, causing the right-angle attachment to vibrate when I'm drilling through wood."
4,Good product but a little bulky for the tight spots,The product is robust and would have received 5 stars if it was a little smaller for the tight spaces.
3,Worked OK,"The product worked well enough as a right angle drill attachment, but I had a tough time rotating the handle around. You have to loosen it and then rotate it all the way up towards the top before you can reposition it, and I found it very difficult to do. The handle kept sticking as I repositioned it when it should have turned smoothly. Depending on the postition I needed, it was quite annoying."
1,don't bother,"235lbs of tourque is very little, it's about the half way setting on your cordless drill. you'll end up breaking it in no time, mine lasted about 15 screws. and yes, no magnetic hold, so you'll be cussing the tool out in no time."
1,Major Flaw,"While the item is well built, it has a major flaw, it does not hold screw driver tips or bits by magnet or any other mechanism. So, as soon as you try to work, your screw driver tip or bit falls out. It already requires 2 hands to operate and a third to hold the bit in place."
2,Right Angle Drill Attachment,Works well but shoud have had a 1/4 inch hex that locked in. Like for their drill chuck that goes with it. So the drill chuck is constantly falling out. Not fun as this type of tool is used in crampt conditions normally. Milwaukee needs to get their game on again.
4,almost perfect,"it's a very well and sturdy 90 degree adapter, however because the leverage handle setup/location it puts to much angle pressure on the quick release bits. breaking them at the head and leaving you do deal with a very difficult extraction project. average job stop time 15 minute to tape the broken head out. Just make sure to use strong, american made bits when using this attachment. I repeat! don't use low name brand bits if you do tough work. cheers"
2,Poor quality,"The handle fell off after a few weeks of light usage. For this price, it should be a much tougher product."
4,Only one song is on this single.,"Usually singles have at least three tracks. The three tracks usually include the original track, a remix and a new song. This only has the song Megalomaniac. I own this single, and the good thing about it is that its actually a good song, and the new Incubus album isnt in stores yet. So if you love this song, this is the only way to go till its released in Febuary. But beware, theres only that one song. Its not very expensive though. I think that their new album will be good. This track rocks and it shows alot of promise for it. My favorite Incubus cd so far is Make Yourself. That is a pretty good cd. And their new one is likely to be good too."
4,Interesting Indeed,"Being a big Incubus fan, it's great to hear something new from them again (finally) - this song is dope - took a few listens to get used too, but I heard it live and it was rockin'.Can't wait till Feb 3rd when the full CD is released."
4,"coolest song on the cd,,,,,","I thought this was the best song on the LP...the mixes are good,,more like extended versions of the cd track,,,the megamix is a nice little bonus,,,if you like BOLINGO you will like this single,,,"
2,dissaponted,"There is no way to saturate the tires with air. At it's maximum, they flatten when I put a real load on the cart, Go for the solid wheels instead, even if they are smaller, I've used that one with total success. This one. blah."
4,"Beautiful, Just Beautiful Drawings from the Best","I love Final Fantasy!! I have been a die hard fan since part one was released in 1990. There are several books out that show the visual effects from the Final Fantasy series, but this one is by far the best. It is strait forward, art, from the original designer of FF characters, Yoshitaka Amano. Page for page you will see the steps that he followed making this characters shine.The main reason that I took one star away was because most of the art in this book is finished up designs from Amano. I am a very big fan of his work, ex. Vampire Hunter D, FF1-6,and 9 adn several other Japaneese work. I enjoy his early sketches better, they are much more fantasy like. But that does not mean that this collection is not beautiful as printed.This is a beautiful editon to any Final Fantasy collecton or just plain art or drawings collection. Dont pass this up."
5,"Good buy for any artist, final fantasy fan...","The Art of Final Fantasy IX shows off the artwork from the proclaimed video game. The book contains all types of artwork, from characters designs, transportation designs, backgrounds, enviorments, weapon designs, and 3D renders.Whether you're a Final Fantasy fan or an artist with interest in seeing great character designs as well as enviorments, this is a great book to look at. It also shows off final renders of the characters in 3D. A must have for any animator's library."
5,This band rocked my country!,"The fiddle player is absolutely and positively awesome, incredible, dynamic and the band is equally as powerful. I had no idea they had been around for awhile. I've been around for awhile, however, grew up with rock n' roll in Southern Califrnia 60's. Learning to love country over the past 4 or 5 years has not been hard to do. This group recently performed at a local park and they know how to make their audience happy. My daughter will have to have this CD because if she doesn't I will never see mine again!"
5,buy it!,"If you have an interest in finishing your own needlepoint or cross-stitch projects, you need this book! A dying art, seldom written down, preserved for prosperity. Specifics, diagrams."
2,Finishing book,Amazon process was fine. The book itself is very outdated. The examples it provides are for making items that went out of style 20 years ago.
4,A average- highly decent game,"I got NHL Rivals 2004 a couple of months ago. I found a couple of great ideas that no one has thought about yet. I also found incredibly terrible flaws in gameplay.Pros: Nice animated crowd,awesome commentary, very customizable settingsCons: Music doesnt play frequently enough, not enough different music files, player stats are screwed up,(brett hull is a 93 buddy), when you body check someone else the hit looks the same each time, overall choppy gameplayDont be turned off by the other reviews. Competition for hockey games is low, this causes poor products. I recommend this game for anyone who is not easily aggravated and wants to play a decent hockey game. Also I would recommend Rivals over Nhl 2004."
2,This game is BAD!,"2 Stars for graphics thats the only reason....WOW even the fighting sucks in this game , that is a hard thing to screw up but, hey go Microsoft. THE CONTROL IS THE WORSE EVER SEEN! maybe in any game. This Game is JUST AWFUL and I got it for dirt Cheap thru Microsoft.... man if I payed 50 bucks for this I would be crying now."
4,Great!,Takes me back to my childhood! Great collection of what I think of as a classic. I'm very pleased with this product.
5,awesome,i have loved this series since i was a child n my favorite character is rose so i named my child savannah rose bc love both names
4,Review,"It was exactly as I remembered. A real trip down memory lane, complete with songs and styles from way back."
2,DVD Boxed set of Rags to Riches,The boxed series came with several DVD's. The series were not digitally remastered causing the volume of the DVD to fade in and out and at times very hard to hear. I think they could have done a better job producing this set.
5,Finally . . .,"It's about time. I saw the DVDs that a seller created, but since I was burned once by buying a set of 'Just the Ten of Us' DVDS and the quality was horrible, I am not one to make the same mistake twice. I never thought I'd see this series on DVD -- when I was a kid, I loved the show and was disappointed when it went off the air. I ran across one old episode on an old VHS tape, and watched it over and over until I wore the tape out. So happy to see this coming out on DVD!"
4,Fun Show,"I just received the DVD Rags to Riches, and I am a little disappointed. The sound is not as good as I had hoped.But all in all the episodes are enjoyable. Just as fun as I remembered them to be!"
5,Best soundtrack EVER1,"All of Spike Lee soundtracks are great but this soundtrack with music produced by Michael Bearden is the BEST soundtrack ever, seriously."
3,Good story vs Bad acting,It's a really great movie with a powerful message! Just wish the acting was better. Would have made the movie even better.
5,Book I loved as a teen,"This was my mom's favorite book in high school and it became my favorite book when I was in high school. I hadn't read it in years, so it was great to re-read it."
1,Badly written and explained,"This is by far the worse book I have ever read to-date. The book jumbles the explinations and is badly explained and lasid out. There are no layer-by-layer explinations that are clear, concise and easy to understand.Save yourself the money."
3,A lot of typing errors.,"Not finish reading yet, but found typing error already, on page 30, put extreme as example twice."
3,Missing the magic of the first one.,"Sorry, Aiden, but the first Lucky Pierre release was better. This one sounds a little forced and not quite in the same mindset. Hypnogogia hasn't left my playlist for over three years, and Touchpool hasn't left my shelf since I bought it."
3,Good Product,This is a decent product but not made for heavy use. The actual bottle opener isn't the best and sometimes takes a couple of tries to get the top off completely. the outside housing is a decent grade plastic and the color is very vibrant. Just make sure that you are mounting to something that is very sturdy.
4,Useful Collectable,"This is a well made Coca-Cola collectable that is attractive and useful. It opens bottles easily, collects the caps removed and looks great in my kitchen. Mine arrived with a scratch on the back plate, but the seller was good to work with and made it right."
2,"Looks nice, but functionally useless.","No installation hardware or instructions included. Someone must be pocketing the profit from this.The opener barely makes contact with the bottle cap so it requires strong-arming to open bottles of Coca-Cola. It's obvious that Tablecraft didn't do any dimensional measurements or testing before releasing this to production. It looks very nice, but is functionally useless as a bottle opener."
4,Fran Varady - worth a listen,"I've become a fan of Ann Granger's Fran Varady series of novels. I particularly enjoy listening to Kim Hicks reading them. Fran's a young woman who's struggling against homelessness, alone in the world with no family. She's a survivor, though, with a wry sense of humor and a prickly independence. This isn't the best of the books, but worth your listening time if you want to take a little mental trip to London - not the tourist's London but the London of people like Fran. I recommend it."
3,sprinkler head,"The head was easy to install and adjust. However I thought it was a pulsating water flo, not a stationary one."
5,Great book!,"Helped us look at our ""humanistic"" attitude of WORKAHOLICISM (is that a word?) LOL - we don't have to kill ourselves working. Now to implement this..."
5,Great read,This was a great read. Easy to follow some of the examples and some old but true lessons in the book. Follow them and you will succeed!
4,Gained Perspective,Good insight on how to be more efficient and also enjoy what you do and how you do it. Quick Read.
5,ACTION is The Key,"The inspiration and ideas offered in this slim volume are practical and easy to implement, and no doubt they will work to help one live a more stress-free, enjoyable life.But the reader needs to remember that, as with most books of this type, the key to success is ACTION. Just reading about what you should be doing won't change your life. DOING what you should be doing will change your life.That may seem painfully obvious, but often, I think readers buy this type of book hoping their lives will somehow magically change just by reading the book.Read the book, then take ACTION, and you'll have made a worthwhile purchase.Reviewer: Linda Painchaud-Steinman, PARK EDGE BOOKS"
3,Living the 80/20 Way,"The author is right, 20% of all things produce 80% of the results. Thus the first 20% of the book gives you 80% of the value."
3,Six book series condensed into one book,"If you want a six book series condensed into a single book, here is your book! The story is good but the writing is stilted and there are massive jumps in the time line between chapters. In fact, I actually almost quit the book a couple of times but bulled my way through it."
4,"Overall, a good ""tragedy"" type story","Well worth buying simply because it DOESN'T have a happy, story book style ending.On the downside, the narrative could be a bit more interesting - I enjoy space opera, and was hoping for some good battle scenes, with lots of bigger than life characters. Getting a gritty, ""realistic"" space setting is interesting, but only if you expect it. Overall though, well worth getting."
2,This one's not up to Mr. White's usual standards.,"This one is a HAITE in novel form. (Here's an idea, the end) While the characters are interesting and engaging, much of the action is in summary narrative and lacking in White's usual rich detail. After a great deal of charging about and fighting, abruptly the end looms with dead characters and a vague promise to continue the story with the decendents. Not very satisfying, I'm afraid."
2,Lack Imagination.,"This book seems to model after the great Chinese Classic 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms'. If you're familiar with the plots in the above classic, there is no surprises with this story. In fact, this book does a horrible job in condensing the story line of the great classic. There is little twists and turns to the original plot line."
2,Great story! Horrible Ending,Steven White almost does it all. By combining an interesting and charismatic protagonist with all the other essential elements of a classic space opera White keeps the reader begging for more right up to the end. Unfortunately the end proceeds to dispel all the magic that the earlier 350 pages created. No one cares that the protagonists character's descendants succeed in satisfying the plans of their ancestor. All I wanted was some type of happy/sappy Hollywood ending.
5,"Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic!","The Amidons are fantastic to work with, as are their books and music for dancing and movement in the classroom. I am confident that a non-music person can use this book with the cd easily, and enjoy it just as much as an experienced music teacher! My students ate this stuff up, and it's great to use if you're in a pinch for something to do with a few minutes extra. My favorites in this book are 'Zodaic', 'Jump Jim Joe', and 'Circle Round the Zero.' There is another book that is similar to this one, though I can't remember the name off the top of my head."
3,It's not as what the editorial review said,"First, this dvd player can only use 120V 60 Hz, not 100-240V 50-60Hz as said in the editorial review. That means there's no way to use it in Europe or Asia.Second, I think there some problems with the mp3 playing function. I've got an mp3 cd-r. When I played it with this player, in some songs, the drum sounded funny. It sounded like a box was beaten, not a drum. But when I converted that mp3 song to cd audio, I didn't hear that funny sound. So I think the mp3 playing function has problem.Finally, this player is cheap, but there are some other players with the same functions being at this price, but I haven't got a chance to test others."
1,Norcent Burn Out,"I purchased 2 of these units last year for Christmas presents, and the circuit board has burned out in both of them, within a month of each other. There is evidence of overheating of some resistors and capacitors. My concern is the fuses did not blow to kill the power."
1,Garbage,We used the thing 5-6 times and then it refused to eject our DVD.I guess you get what you pay for! What a piece of junk. I can't believe a store would actually carry such garbage!
1,Lesson learned,"I bought the product a year and a half ago and used it probably 12 times. It was a great price for a feature rich dvd player and while it worked, I really liked it. But now it no longer powers up and because it is out of warranty, Norcent will not repair it for me. Their suggestion is that I go to a local shop to get it serviced. Parts and labor to fix it will no doubt be more than what I paid for the product so now it's just a book end. Don't waste your money on a non-brand name product! I learned a valuable lesson: if it's too good to be true, it usually isn't true."
4,Looks can be deceiving,"The Norcent DP300 DVD Player is indeed a good dvd player to have in your room or living room, or wherever you wish to keep it (as long as it's not the bathroom!). However, I have this DVD player and think it is not as great as it seems to be. For one, you ALWAYS have to push the button to turn it off and on which for me is annoying. Two, you can't tell how far you are in your movie, which I also like to know. Three, the player makes an occasional buzz-like sound when in use. I find that particularly annoying. -_-And four, the remote is just really ugly!I don't really mind having this DVD player for a little while, but it does get on my nerves every once in a while.I give this DVD player 4 stars for its looks and for some of its quality."
4,"A great play all, DVD player","I got this unit a few months back because it will play just about anything you put in it. In the tradition of the APEX line of products but it has a much better remote than most of those units. If you are into making VCDs and SVCDs this is great unit. The on-remote zoom is a great feature. Picture quality is a little better than average and it does not have an optical output as the editorial suggests, just one coaxial. If you are looking for a play-all, this is it."
2,CUTE BUT FAULTY,"Looks cute Ok, and has many accexxories. But IT PLAYS UP TO A POINT AND JUST STOPS. OR STOPS AND SKIPS FAR AHEAD. VERY FRUSTRATING ESPECIALLY WHEN WATCHING INTERESTING MOVIES OR LISTENING TO NICE SONGS.I wonder why, or it item not really as branc new as described?Thanks"
1,Played 1 DVD and DIED!,"Bought this a week ago, I hooked up the DVD player, tested it to make sure it worked (and that I plugged it in right) and it was fine! Went to watch a movie a few days later and it was dead! The picture was all b/w and smeary - tried multiple disks to no aveil....not even the start up screen showed correctly but sound worked fine. BEWARE BEWARE of the cheap DVD player!"
1,buyer beware,"I bought this player a year ago to be used in the guest bedroom.I knew I was taking a risk but I fell for the ""wow this is really cheap"" and the ""how bad could it be, after all it will only be used every now and again by visiting family and friends"" big mistake. This is a total heap. save your money and buy another brand, beware of cheap chinese rip off garbage."
1,davemac,Price was (literally) too good to be true. Returned mine after first use - due to defect. The picture would become very bright and lose color every 15 or 20 seconds. Only other gripe was that there is no way to turn unit on/off via remote.
3,Disposable DVD Players!,"Works great so far. At these prices, these units are really disposable type players. Have good use of it for a year, and if it breaks down, dont repair it, just buy another one!"
4,Awful,"I bought this player and it worked for about a year and a half. I wrote a review giving it four stars. I was able to hack it and play foreign DVDs, regardless of region code, just fine. As soon as the warranty expired - literally, within a few days - it began to act up and within a week or two I could put a DVD in the player and it wouldn't even respond. Junk."
5,5 stars for the price range...,"I purchased this player in Feb of 2003.All I wanted was to play DvD's. That's it. Nothing else. And that is exactly what I got in this player, and much more. The fact that it plays CD-R/W's and CD's and MP3's (contrary to another review, THIS PLAYER DOES NOT PLAY .MPEGS or .AVI's!) is a delightful bonus, and one I expect to take full advantage of.Overall, I'm happy with this player for the price. But there are a few minor complaints worth mentioning. The remote is feature rich, however its layout stinks; the buttons are oddly placed. It is very slow to load a DvD or CD and be ready for play. And here's a legitimate bad point: it can not be powered up with the remote; you can only operate the standby feature from the remote; you must hit the on/off switch on the unit itself. And also, the power button is so stiff I have to hold the unit down to push the button, otherwise I'd push the unit clear off my TV.Other than that I'm quite happy. 5 stars!"
1,Waste of time and money!,"I purchased my Norcent 300 DVD Player last year and used it a couple of times. It worked great and the picture was good. I did not use it for a couple of months and when I try to play a DVD again, it would not play. I contacted Norcent in California and returned the player for a replacement. A month later, I got the replacement. It does not work at all. I questioned if the replacement DVD was new, they could have just sent me back my orginial DVD player. Again, I contacted customer service but have received no response. Too bad, I thought this product had real potential. Don't waste your time or money unless you are in need of a frustrating experience."
4,No nonsense player,"Having purchased this player few months back, not once did I face problems. A DVD player worth the $$$$"
1,Quality Control Problems,"I purchased 2 of these units 4 months ago and they worked flawlessly. Recently though, I purchased another unit and it made an anoying high pitched wine and the picture would freeze constantly. I returned this unit for another one assuming that I had received a rare ""bad"" unit. The replacement came a week later and had the exact same problems with the high pitched wine and the picture kept freezing. This has led me to believe that Norcent has some serious quality control problems."
4,Lot of miles for the price,According to my history I ordered this in May of 2003 and the price was right (for a budget machine). It was my first stand-alone machine and it lasted until June 2008.So this was bought knowing it was a budget player and hoped I'd have it working for a year or so.Four stars just because I've had other budget machines 20+ years and they still work for me.
4,"Reliable, Durable, Basic Player","I purchased this DVD player mainly because of its multi-format support. I normaly purchase Pakistani and Indian CDs, DVDs and it has a never refused to play any. I have been putting it to rough use but it never failed. After using it for over 4 years, it made its way to my 5 yrs old's room and is still running great. I am very impressed with its durability specially it costed me just 30 bucks back in 2003."
1,Piece of JUNK!!!!,Worked fine for awhile. Then started skipping durring movies. At one point I spent an hour trying to figure how to get it to work right. Web site says the menu needs to be default. Did that...sill sucked. Customer Service told me I just didnt know how to use it. F*CK THEM. Finally one day I just threw it into the wall. Best show I ever saw. The thing just broke into thousands of pieces. Shows how sturdy they are. I suggest you DONT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!! They products are horrible and the service people can't speak english.
3,"Decent overall, bad MP3 decoding","Got this player recently. Overall, am happy with the product.Good:Decent video quality (for the price)Good audioNice JPEG decoding (a little slow though) with different picture transitionsInterface and remote are OKBad:The only bad thing I feel is the MP3 decoding. I can't tell if its popping noise or the decoding, but the quality is bad. I can see a clear difference. I use coax digital out."
3,Not a Multi-Region Stuff,"I purchased this DVD player seeing that it can be played anywhere (110 V - 240 V). It is not true. It plays only at 110 V. It plays the dvds okay, but with the same price if you get a better quality product like Apex, why to buy it. I returned this player in 2 days."
2,Disappointed!!,"I bought this dvd player because it played both Pal and NTSC regions and it played cdrs/cdrws. Much to my disappointment, it will not play a single one of my cdr/cdrws. The dvd player looked very nice and had great features but I am very disappointed by its incapability to keep up with its promises. I called the Norcent company's help line and they simply said that it must be defective. I don't know if it all these dvd player are like this but Iknow that I am very unhappy with the one I recieved."
1,"IT's A JuNK!! Besides, Customer Service Department is TraSH!","BE AWARE!!!! NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM NORCENT!!!!MINE Norcent DP 300 was out of order after A week! I called them. Thier reply was laughing at me and saying ""Can you operate HIGH-TECH Machine???"" I just hung up the phone and returned it back to Amazon!!!"
2,Worked great ... for a couple months,"I bought this unit in July 2003 with some hesitation. I read everything I could about it because it was inexpensive but my intuition was that you get what you pay for. Unfortunately, I should have gone with my intuition. The unit stopped recognizing DVDs and won't work at all anymore. Oh well. I will say that it worked nicely for the 5 months that I did use it."
1,Terrible!!,I bought 2 of these players for gifts. One would not read DVDs or MP3s. I sent it back and recieved another defective one. I just hope the second one I gave lasts a little longer. DON'T BUY ONE!!!
4,A decent DVD player...,"...if you don't mind 1) not having power on/off on remote control 2) rather tardy DVD/CD tray 3) not having 'random' play of tracks on a music CD 4) an almost useless user manual and 5) a silver-finish unit.Other than the above complaints, this feature-rich DVD player is definitely worth the sixty some dollars I paid for it in Feb 2003. More so, if you play DVDs from other regions or want to use this player in other regions (120/240 V, 50/60 Hz, PAL/NTSC). Yes, with the code (a sequence of button presses on te remote control) available on the internet, my player now plays DVDs from any region! Also DVD/DVD-R/CD/CD-R discs play without any problems."
4,easily made region free,"I brought norcent DP300 HE112******. There are lots of procedures to make it region free. The one that worked for me was :1)Turn Power on2)using remote open/close,setup,8,8,8,8,Next(>>|)3)A page appears ...goto version and change the region to 0 for region free.4)Goto to main page and you are done.....hurrrray"
4,Excellent player at a nice price.,"Our first DVD player, we've had this one since May 2003. It was very easy to set up and use (in about 20 minutes if I recall), and it has never given us a problem. Controls are easy to use, and the only reason I'm not giving it a perfect 5 stars is because you need point the remote right at the DVD player, not the TV, to work it. It's a very minor thing, though, and I would definitely recommend this player, even though other brands have come down in price since we got this one."
5,Great DVD player for the price !,I was looking for a 2nd dvd player for my bedroom. I wasn't looking for anything fancy with lots of bells and whistles. I just wanted something simple to watch movies on occassionally. I was amazed and hesitant to buy this DVD player because it was so inexpensive. I know that you get what you pay for but so far this is a GREAT dvd player. It was SO easy to set up and the picture is very clean and clear. I'm very impressed so far and hope that I'm not disappointed if it dies in the coming months.
4,A Happy little viewer,"I am very happy with my norcent purchase. It is an inexpensive DVD and does the job just fine in playing US DVD's, CD's Mp3's etc. I am not a video junkie, so i cannot comment on other features.For regular viewers, A dvd is a must purchase- it gives better picture quality than a VCR or regular TV. The norcent does most of what you would expect out of a DVD- At this price, this DVD is a winner."
1,"DVDs not working, CDs work!","Just received this unit ordered through Amazon.com (quick shipment!!) and am disappointed that it is not functioning. Every DVD inserted results in a 'loading' message followed by 'No Disc'. However, audio CDs work fine.The user manual is barely adequate.I've contacted Norcet Tech support and am awaiting a response. I'll update this review with the outcome."
1,Don't Waste Your Money Here,"This DVD player is junk. We were drawn in by the low price and since it has been a couple of years since we bought a DVD player, we thought prices have really come down. What a mistake. Better to pay a couple of bucks more. You know what they say - you get what you pay for. First, the remote control does not allow you to set your TV for DVD mode, meaning, you need to use your TV's remote to do this. If you have cable - that means you need to use 3 remote controls just to get your DVD going. What a hassle. Additionally, the box does not play the sound properly - separating the dialogue sound from the background music. The background music gets loud and you can't hear the dialogue. On some DVD's you couldn't hear the sound at all. I could go about the drop in functionality from the Sony we had previously, but, I think I would run out of space. This machine is garbage."
1,Piece of You-Know-What,"I only got this DVD player on Xmas, and already it does the following: doesn't load the disk, loads the disk and plays w/o sound, flashes different colors when turned on, and motor hums, but nothing happens.After reading how bad the company's CS is, I don't even think I'm going to bother to have it fixed. I would rather shell out more cash and buy a DVD by a REAL company, not this Cracker-Jack outfit called Norcent.I am stunned, additionally, to see that this product can be purchased for $200. You would have to be a damned fool to spend that kind of money on such a poor product.And at this rate, I wouldn't be afraid of China taking over the world."
1,Don't waste your money,"the first time I watched a movie, it seemed just fine. Then I was watching the ""bonus features"" on a dvd and it kept skipping, then freezing. What a pain! After a week of watching movies (maybe that particular DVD was wacked), I kept noticing it was not only freezing on me, but pixelating. Now watching a movie became a chore. Wal-Mart was very expedient in returning my money, but I would stay away from this player."
5,Great bang for the buck!,"I bought it to use in my bedroom, but it quickly earned a spot in the downstairs entertainment center. Yes it looks and feels like a $30 player, but the performance is great, playing everything I've thrown at it without any visible motion artifacts or other problems.My $350 Sony refuses to play home-burned CDRs, and chokes on about half of the home-burned DVDs I've tried, but the little Norcent plays EVERYTHING with ease. Even MP3 and MPG files play flawlessly."
2,"Great price, but faulty player","After reading many positive reviews on this player, I decided to give it a try, but haven't found it to be as good as the other reviews. I received a player with beginning serial #113 (the newest version of the player). The price is great and it can be made region free, but PAL discs play back with noticeable pixelization. When playing regular movies, about 1-2 second pauses/skips occur periodically while playing almost any movie. Moire patterns are also constantly noticeable throughout movies. I have also noticed the incorrect framing problem (it cuts off a portion of the left & right side of the image). My friend has a cheap APEX that has the same features and doesn't exhibit any of these problems. I will be returning this player in exchange for another brand."
2,DVD Player didn't work,I sent this item to a friend. She just told me when they put a DVD in the machine it would not play. It never worked. Too bad it is too late to return the item.
1,Broke After 15 Months,"Sure it has a warranty for a year, but you are SOL if it breaks after a mere 15 months of useage. I bought this player in Feb 2003 and now it's May of 2004 and I have no working DVD player.Amazon you have the perfect system. You will certainly sell ANYTHING and there's no recourse for some of the crap you sell. I have a CD player that still works from 1988 and a VCR from 1991. Is technology getter better? No it is getting cheaper."
1,Totally and Completely Useless,"I wish I could give it lower than one star, it surely doesn't deserve even that. My boyfriend bought me this dvd player for my birthday, the end of January. We began having problems with it right away, it freezes up several times during a movie and sometimes the subtitles just keep popping up (even though we tried shutting them off about 20 times, this happened during ""Once upon a time in Mexico""). Now it is mid-March and it has stopped recognizing DVD's so it now totally and completely useless, and it's been two months since we got it and don't have a receipt. My boyfriend paid $40.00 to be able to watch approximately 6-8 movies (at most), and it was a pain in the a$$ watching them. Don't buy this product!! if you know what's good for you."
5,Missile with a man in it...,"If there's a sexy looking bird the F-104 must be the one , even on the ground it looks it's doing Mach 2, volume 38 is a great collection of text&images about the genesis of the missile with a man on it¡¡¡ a five star choice."
4,OK deal for the price,"We needed this costume to take apart and use on another costume and found it to be perfect for our needs. Props got the mask and we got the guaze, everyone was pleased."
3,An Average Book,"This review concerns the original 1939 edition and the revised 1969 edition. Both books tell the story of a woman who owns many cats, of her long-lost love and of spooky tapping noises which she hears inside her house. However, each book tells the mystery in a different way so that they are basically two different stories. These were average books, not particularly exciting, but not boring either. The mystery isn't bad and there is a moderate amount of action. Personally, I thought that the revised edition was a little more interesting, but either one is worth reading. I'd give them both 3 stars."
2,sigh.....,"this series is stupid,the only good episodes were at the end of the series,there's a season1 box set that's supposed to be released later on this year I suggest that the older fans (the ones who like gen1) pick up the box sets and not these single discs,if you have a two year old and want a ""baby sitter"" then this is the disc to get,but it's not for the serious transfan...."
3,Lots of Philosophy and Little Scripture,"Some pretty dense reading, may take twice for you to fully understand the arguments. However, much of what passes for theological debate between Calvinists and Arminians is really rooted in whatever philosophical construct has been erected to reconcile free-will and soveriegnty, so this book is important in that respect.I was disappointed with the book for not dealing with such passages as Rom 9:19, Luk 7:30, the unpardonable sin, etc. I am having to look elsewhere for discussions on many key passages."
3,"If you like Dr John, its OK","This lacks that funk punch of his older music, he still sounds good though. I think tis is a good CD for introducing into funk compilations"
2,This is one of Dr. John's Worst recordings,"Released on the heels of his tell-all autobiography and heroin-habit kicking, this should be better than it is. First of all, the only person rapping on a Dr. John album is Dr. John. Second, the funk is flat. Even Thank You Falletinme Be Mice Elf Again, great as a Sly and the Family Stone Tune, is not particularly funky. Dr. John has a habit of recording one or two great ones followed by a not-so great one. This is a real low point."
5,REALLY OK,I DO NOT GIVE THIS BABY HARD BUMPS SO CANNOT HELP THERE . GOOD SOUND .GOOD VALUE. GET AC ADAPTER. EASY USE. ONE BATTERY IDEA GREAT . CONTROLS COULD BE PLAINER. IF THIS DOESN'T HELP GO TO RETAIL SHOP.
2,disappointing,"There were several disappointments with this product. First it shipped without a transformer, assuming one would use it only with batteries. Its controls are cumbersome. Sound is OK."
2,It doesn't come with AC adaptor in U.S.,"I bought it because it said that it comes with AC adaptor. But you know what, the AC power adaptor is not supplied with USA, Cannadian models. I felt like been cheated. At least they should have let me know that I am getting. Maybe next time I should check with the stores first before I get anything on-line."
5,Cool idea! perfect for everyday's stationary!,"Very interesting product, fantastic idea and it works perfectly. I recommend this for anybody! my mom loved it! i enjoyed it! and kids must like it too."
4,perfect for young babies,"This book has been a hit from the start with my 6 months old baby -maybe a little too much: at the very first reading, she got so excited at the last page that she managed to pull the mane of the lion right off the book! So parents, if your baby has good ""grabbing"" skills, beware! Generally though, this board book is sturdy, colorful, great to learn about textures, and has thick pages that are easy to turn with baby hands. We go back to this book often. My now 9 months old is still too young to pay attention to the little mouse on each page, but I expect it will be a nice addition later to have her find it.I gave it only 4 stars due to the page that was destroyed so easily, and also there is one page that I don't like that much (""shiny teeth"" -unappealing drawing, and shiny is not easy considering the book is glossy). I also bought ""That's not my monkey"" and I like it more (so does my baby).Overall, I highly recommend books in this series."
3,"Great Series, Other Books Better","My son LOVES this line of books; but this one fell short for him!""That's Not My Monster"" is his absolute favorite, and he likes ""That's Not My Dragon"" the 2nd. I bought That's Not My Pony, That's Not My Monkey and That's Not My Lion recently. He enjoys the monkey one, but the other 2 he doesn't care much for. I couldn't say why, I think textures are really the same book to book, so it must be the pictures. I highly recommend these books though."
5,This book connects!,"We went to a tots library reading hour. My 16 month old grandson loved this book so much that he went around and gathered everyone else's book, too. I bought it for him for Christmas and it is now one of his favorite books, which says a lot because I'm an elementary teacher and have bought him a ton of books. He runs to it, throws it in the rocker, and hops up on our laps to snuggles up and read. We love the humor, the repetition, and the textures."
2,Damaged parts,"I purchased this crib at a local Toys-R-Us. I tried to assemble it the same day I purchased the crib. However, I discovered that 2 of the parts (a front leg, back rail) were damaged. The store did not have any other Roma crib other than the one on display, so they ordered more. When the replacement crib came, it was damaged, too!"
2,Best of Babylon 5,Clearly this was not the best of Babylon 5. The recordings where in my professional opinion poorly mixed. The arrangements on some of the tracks is amateurish. There were several tracks that didn't even appear in the series but were from a video game release. Obviously a poor way to fill up a CD with fluff.I would have liked to have tracks from the episode Sleeping in light. That is in my opinion one of the best tracks Franke has written for the series
3,Track list doesn't match,"I've bought this CD twice and if you look at the pictures for this product, specifically the one of the back of the CD, it doesn't match the track list for this item. The one song I want is Sleeping in Light:Dying Station. It is not on the CD. The CD itself seems to match what's listed on the back of the CD case. Can anyone help me find the right one? Was there more than one volume of The Best of Bablyon 5 CDs? If there is a seller who has a CD that has tracks the match the listing for this item - what's listed on Amazon not the back of the disk in the picture, let me know.Thank you.Jennifer"
4,"Good, not great","There are some gems on this CD. Most of the music is nondescript when you listen to it; it is much more suited to being the background music of a TV show, of course. In other words, it's not like regular music you get on a regular commercial band's CD. In my opinion, the best songs are the Main Titles, in particular the 5th season."
1,I demand the hour of my life back that Hogan stole from me.,"Basically it's Hogan spewing his orange-skinned garbage for an hour with some really horrible wrestling mixed in. Avoid at all costs. You could go blind, I almost did."
1,This Video Is Not Good.,"I Know Some Of You People Don't Believe This But This Video Was Not Good. I Really Don't Like Hulk Hogan At All Even Though He Is A Lagend, And A Fan Favorite. I Remeber What He Did At Bash At The Beach 1996. I Would Get The Goldberg Video. I Used To Like Hulk Before He Went Bad."
3,Alright,"It was alright. But it could of been beter. It should of showed Hulk Hogans classic matches with Vader at WCW Uncensored and Bash at the Beach. It also should of shown his match with Ric Flair at Halloween Havoc 94. But overall, it was good."
3,wong,this is for men for sperm countFemale Homone Blend SP-7C is the the one u want if u are a lady you would think the sell would put that on here and tell u whats in it but they didnt you should never buy a pill if u dont know whats in it keep that in mind
3,Not-So-Sure!,"I have used this product along with other vitamins recommended for me by my doctor (and my research) for many months now. I have been trying to conceive baby #2 for about 1 & 1/2 years now. Apparently this product has not done anything for me in THAT department. I am doing more research now and finding that I will be trying a totally different supplement/herb combination now. This ""blend"" does not have any of the recommended things in it. I would buy this with caution. But remember that everyone's body's are different and react differently to different things. Might be worth a try but do not expect anything from this product, or others for that matter. I did not have any side effects from this supplement, nor did it help my menstrual cylce, ovulation, conception, or anything else. Time to try something else! Good luck to you!"
4,The Fourth Dimension,"Interesting book, from a very strong Christian, with a very intense view of how powerful prayer can be in your life."
4,enlightening,"Dr. Cho is a BRILLIANT man who knows the Holy Spirit. He stopped short of telling me how to acess the Holy Spirit, so I am reading Vol 2 and I think the answer may be in there."
4,Enjoyed Fourth Dimension,"This is one of a series that Personal Empowerment group is reading. It met my expectations, was delivered in a suitable timeframe and we as a group are using the techniques in our group for personal growth."
2,Interesting but weird in some ways,"I was asked to read this book (along with several others from this author), by a friend. I am a Christian who holds a Biblical worldview and found this book to be interesting in many ways, but off the ,ark in some ways too. If you have a strong Bible background...you can sift the wheat from the chaff in this book and the Spirit will certainly speak through it. If not, I suggest you run from it and don't allow this into your head."
1,Big Waste of Money,"I purchased this book for our pending tour of the UK. This is by far the worst travel guide I have ever purchased. There is very little practical information. The photos and maps need a magnifying glass in order to read. Lastly, the authors seem to think the information that interests tourists the most is the degree of environmental problems in the UK and the locations of the best gay bars. Not a guide for your average tourist. Better choices are ""The Rough Guide to Wales"" and ""The Eyewitness Travel Guides""."
1,Units Please!,"I cannot review the whole book, but I spent too much time trying to decifer chapter 20 on Design of Foundations for Vibration Control. Task at hand: design a foundation big enough to dampen the frequency of a certain machine. the tables of factors for given equations were given in inconsistent units. Eventually through a Mechanical Engineering handbook, I discovered that gravity should have been in inches/s/s and the soil spring given in kips/cubic foot should've been lbs/ft."
3,Geotech engineering,As it is there is not much to this field. Thisbook takes you where you wanna go....if you can gofar...this is not the one.
2,so-so,I regret this purchase. If you want to know how to do these calculations...do not buy this book. If you would like to blindly use a diskette to solve problems...well by all means purchase now.
4,A fundamental reference,"If you have only a few geotechnical engineering books, this should be one of them. As a practicing geotechnical engineer I use this book 2 to 3 times per week. It includes the theory and essential reference material."
3,Its Alright.,"Its a very good source, and considered a bible by some, but is strictly in metric and also relies on software instead of thorough calculations at certain points. I dont have a hatred of metric, but I wasnt raised on trained in the system so it'll make you feel quite left out if youre not an SI guy/girl. As to the software comment, its very true and sometimes examples skip steps at which point the author jumps from A to D to M to Z with little or no explanation."
2,Simplistic view,"I had a hard time getting into this book because of its simplistic characters, plot and dialogue. Because I persisted, I was rewarded with a good story and an interesting view of our military. It is a fast, easy read due to its lack of real intrigue. If you are looking for something light about a heavy subject, this is your book."
3,not that great but fun if you let it,i remember when the first show aired on t.v. and never saw this one again. it's the story of police or ragners of the future. nothing great here but it is kind of fun if you'll let it be.
3,Calling Jeff Kaake Fans,"I am a Jeff Kaake fan! Even though the plot isn't the best (which is probably why this show only lasted six episodes) if you are a Jeff Kaake fan, you still have to see this. Even though he isn't clean shaven and roughed up a bit, he is still good looking and a great actor.The characters are quirky, always getting by--barely--by the seats of their pants, honorable, and the good guys (and gals) always win. This is not a heavy show and there are always several laughs along the way."
2,Item returned,Wasn't at all what was expected. Returned it even though the restocking fees were high. Definitely not worth the cost of this DVD.
4,Good interactive book,"Pop-up books are fun. Even more fun are pop-up books that make animal noises. This thick, sturdy book is one of these. Featuring colorful pictures and large text, the book is loads of fun to read to little kids, or for little kids to read to themselves."
3,Interesting But Not Essential,"Bass virtuoso Rob Wasserman underpins a wide variety of music that was originally released in 1994. With contributions from the likes of Carney and Brian Wilson, Bruce Hornsby, Elvis Costello, Edie Brickell, Neil Young, Willie Dixon, Jerry Garcia, and others, this is an eclectic but consistently enjoyable collection of tunes. I did not have the original silver disk available for comparison, but I can report that the UDCD release sounds awfully nice. For me, the highlight of the disk is the opening cut, ""Fantasy is Reality,"" performed by Wasserman and the Wilsons. The rest of the tunes are OK, but perhaps the whole recording is just too eclectic for its own good."
3,Not as good as Solo,Wasserman is a great bassist. There's some nice tracks on this album. No complaints. But his Solo album holds together better and inspires more repeated listenings.
5,"Better than my ""stock"" brakes","This was the first time I had ever changed the brakes on any bike. I only bought the front set just in case I didn't install them right (so I'd still have the rear brakes). They are easy to install with the instructions and they work nicely! They fit my bike (a Giant) better than the brakes I bought the bike with! The pads are also much better than the ""WalMart Specials"" I had on before; from now on I will purchase the Shimano brake pads. They stop my bike much better than before. In summary:- Easy to install- Easy to adjust- Highly responsive brakes!I will be purchasing the rear brakes next!"
4,good upgrade for older bikes,Good upgrade for older bikes. You may need to upgrade your brake levers as well. The brakes apparently need a different attach point than what is std on the old cantilever brakes. This will become evident as you read the instructions\illustrations with the brakes.
4,Good deal,I had bought a cheap mountain bike for occasional riding. Of course it came with very cheap parts. I decided to upgrade a few essential parts like the brakes. I bought the Shimano Acera V-brakes to replace the ones that came installed on the bike. The difference is amazing.Had to return one set due to the tension spring being too short. When the brake were applied the spring would slip under the post on the brake arm and spring free. Amazon was quick to replace it and the new one lacks the short spring. I am sure it was just cut a little short.Overall these are worth the low price.
5,V-brakes conversion,I recently converted my older mountain bike that had caliper brake to Shimino v-brakes. My order from amazon.com supplier shippped the brakes in a well packed box to protect my order. The brakes are great qulaity for the price and they look and work great on my bike.
1,"Take it away... far, far away...","As always, Jax delivers a lackluster product. As far as I know, Take Away didn't exist in public domain before they produced a version of it (which for Jax is amazing, since they have produced versions of Nerts (Solitaire Frenzy), Shut The Box (Chips), Kings In The Corner (Kings In The Corner... trés original, no?), and even Rock Paper Scissors (Rock Paper Scissors: The Card Game. I kid you not). While Jax wants to portray the game as being even remotely strategic, it's almost totally luck. The rules are horribly written, too. Paragraphs go where sentences would suffice, and the whole thing just reeks of being written by an attorney or Congressman. If you feel like you need to pay 10 bucks for a specialized plastic gizmo and a deck of playing cards, go right ahead and pick this up. I'll pass."
5,The definitive album,Midnight Radio is the definitive Big Head Todd album. It traces the roots of the band and explores the early guitar influences of Todd Park Mohr. Simply listen to the guitar on Love Betsy and you will see what I mean. Enjoy.
5,"Unbeliveable, so emotional, yet so much fun.","This C.D. is so great. The band is so talented it makes me sick. ""The Leaving Song"" is so well written, as is the rest of the C.D. from begining to end this C.D. is so great if you have even heard of B.H.T.M. you should buy this, and all of the others. A must have."
3,Okay...charming for what it is...,"I expected more from this book. Some of the stories are too intangible for me, too much about emotion with too much personification. The more simple, narrative stories are incredible. I've read many stories from Lapland, northern Canada, Alaska and beyond, and the stories all have many things in common. The stories can be slow at times and illustrate the simple life of Siberia, but they are win/lose -- as I said, I liked about 60% of stories and the other 40% bored me to some extent. If you're interested in northern life, especially old/traditional life in the north or in Siberia, this is a good read, but don't expect too much...the stories are very simple, with very human but blunt themes."
4,"Great singing and acting, too dark on the stage","The performance of this Spanish production is outstanding in terms of singing and acting. Unfortunately, the director made poor decisions from moving the period of the opera to the 1940's which makes the story-line less believable, while his intent was the opposite. However, the most annoying part of the production is that most of the stage is far too dark to the extent that the faces of the actors cannot be properly seen even in close-ups. The fact that Don Giovanni has a dark personality does not mean that the performance has to hide it by dark stage. If not for this shortcomings I would have given it five stars."
4,Loved it.,"Having read the first 3 volumes helps, but with the intro it isn't totally necessary. It's a wonderful storyline about a female artist who goes to a vampire's house to paint a portrait. Very Goth. Only 4 stars because it leaves you hanging way too much, and you just can't stop reading it."
4,Functional Lock,"Sturdy and functional lock, but my 13-year old nephew who has a fascination with locks, was able to pick it open. Still a good buy."
3,Yes and No,"This item appears in all rights and appearances to be a colorized version but it is not. It is a black and white version which is not what we were looking for. The colorized version is apparently not available on DVD as of yet from the studio. If you are looking for an original B&W; version then I by all means recommend this seller.I contacted the seller about this and they issued a return authorization without delay, therefore I would highly recommend this seller to anyone who is looking for honesty and integrity. I have rarely found that kind of customer service in online auction sites therefore in the future when I am looking for DVDs or videos I will look at this sellers available stock first."
5,The movie was great and the service terrific,I would reccomend the movie because it is the best of all the productions of the Christmas Carol. Also the streaming was perfect.
4,Right up there!,While I prefer the original with Reginald Owen this version rates a close second. It's longer format and expanded time during visitations was a nice quality.
5,Gets you into the spirit.,The best version of the best Christmas movie. No movie could get you into the Christmas spirit more than this movie.
5,Swift telling of Scrooge,"There are four SCROOGE movies that we own to enjoy the Christmas Season: 1.) with Alistair Sim - - for a dramatic, eerie feel. Look for the ghost of Marley Star Wars Fans - - Obi Wan? 2.) Reginald Owen - - this is swift Scrooge tale that doesn't scare the boohoogies off the kiddies. Scrooge is portrayed as a glum, bitter hermit that is in love with wealth and who finds a new chamber in his heart of cares. 3.) Albert Finney - - musical Scrooge. The snappy tunes and melodies are great. 4.) SCROOGED - - Bill Murray. This is a comedy / modern day / Scrooge. We love them all!"
1,bad quality,The dvd that I received is a lousy copy. Fades in and out thru out movie.Could make a better copy on your home computer.
2,Did the screenwriter read the book?,"This is a lovely little Christmas story about an employer who sees the error of his ways, and has a change of heart. And some of the names are borrowed from Charles Dickens' classic. But otherwise, I think these screenwriter might have mistakenly read a book by Charles Dikkens, the well-known Dutch author. The characters have a look that seems a little Dickens-ish, but good grief... who are these characters, and what happened to the story?"
3,A soap opera starring Bob Cratchit,"When I was a child, I loved this version of Dickens' A Christmas Carol. Wow, growing up changed everything! I watched this film recently after seeing the Alastair Sim version and I must say that this film kind of reeks. You could call this film The Bob Cratchit Story co-starring Ebenezer Scrooge. This film presents the Cratchit family in unremitting detail until the story of their lives becomes quite nauseating. And, Tiny Tim (who isn't so Tiny) is on camera entirely too much. In contrast, the Sim film focuses on the life of Scrooge and psychoanalyzes him in depth. It is also much truer to the allegorical aspects of Dickens' novel, including the shocking presentation of the children ""Want"" and ""Ignorance"". Do yourself a favor and watch either the Sim film or the excellent TV production starring George C. Scott. I'm sorry, but The Cratchit Story pales in comparison."
5,"NO DOUBT ABOUT IT, THIS IS THE BEST CHRISTMAS CAROL YET","By far this is the best christmas carol yet, it gets you in the x-mas spirit immediately, from the streets of london, to the merry men saying merry x-mas to one and all. the music grabs you and the acting is great. its classic, its the type of movie that you will want to watch every x-mas, and you will know the lines by heart. When bob cratchit is getting items for his wife for x-mas dinner, that is where you should endure the x-mas spirit. this beats out any christmas carol out there, i watch it at least 5x a year. Reginald Owen should win an oscar. and Lochart, who also played in miracle on 34th street is in a class by himself. get it today"
5,A Sentimental favorite,"I'm definitely biased, but I still think this is the best version by far. I first saw it on television when I was about 12 years old, and I was spellbound. DO NOT see the colorized version, it looks like a sickly pastel mess, B&W; is the only way to go.Reginald Owen puts in a perfect performance as Scrooge. Gene Lockhart - I love his interpretation of Cratchit - an embattled, generous soul trying to make the best of a desperate situation. All the other supporting actors do a fine job. And the sets and costumes are wonderful - they really make this a warm, cozy, atmospheric Christmas Carol. Other versions are scarier, but this one still gets its message across while succeeding in filling that ""warm and fuzzy"" desire we all get 'round the holidays. Let this version not be forgotten!"
2,Hokey,"Reginald Owen's doddering portrayal of Scrooge will make you cringe, and the overall hokeyness of the movie is just too much. Did you chuckle when the priest outrageously decided to slide on the ice like the kids? Neither did I. The excellent performances of Gene and Kathleen Lockhart as the Cratchits is to be noted, but even they can't save this version of A Christmas Carol. If you are reading these reviews for the purpose of choosing a version of this movie to watch, do yourself a favor and buy the 1951 movie starring Alistair Sim, far and away the best iteration of this great story."
5,A CHRISTMAS CAROL-1938,"This 1938 MGM version of Christmas Carol has what is to me a better Jacob Marley, the one in the Alaistair Sim version inspires me to say stop overacting Jacob, but Tiny Tim here seems to have too much christmas spirit in him, i like the tiny tim in the sim version better. The man in church with the loud voice that seems to drown out everyone else is Fred, Scrooge's nephew."
3,Least faithful adaptation but still a good christmas movie.,"Reginald Owen plays an excellent scrooge and the Lockheart family does a fine job in the supporting Cratchet family role. Those performances carry a film that is the least faithful adaptation of any of the scrooges out there.We see a few additions such as Mr. Scrooges hat and sliding on ice. We see a slightly different ending (which is copied decades later by the musical adaption SCROOGE and by the MUPPET CHRISTMAS CARROL.This is the version I grew up with but every other version seems to have strength that this one doesn't. I haven't seen the new Patrick Stewart one but the Alaster Sim and Geroge C. Scott versions are much better but also much heavier.This one however is lighter than the others. Owen doesn't seem down deep as nasty as the others, it is more of a playful film. Short of the Muppet version I'd say the best for kids to start with.Worth a watch."
2,'Tis a shame....,".... that Lionel Barrymore was not around to star in this film. If you can EVER get a copy of one of his radio performances, it is OUT OF THIS WORLD. (I think like for everyone, I have affection for Barrymore because he was the first Scrooge I knew --- from a record, I'm not that old --- but the man was an acting icon. But he was paralyzed from the waist down due to an illness and couldn't play the role. Tsk.) I'm sure Reginald Owen was a nice man, but his portrayal is truly one-dimensional. The script is schmaltzy, especially that ending! But like someone wrote earlier, the focus on the Cratchit family is phenomenol. Gene Lockhart is just great as Bob Cratchit, and June Lockhart is such a novelty."
4,A very good version !!!,"After reading all the reviews on this film,and having seen this version about 15 times,at least,I feel I can give a objective review. This is the MGM version,which drifts from the book here and there,and it is not as good as the best version ever (the 1951 version with Alistair Sim,that version is pure gold,one of the greatest films ever.)Reginald Owen does a great job as Scrooge,the supporting cast is good,and this film is well worth seeing.It just doesen't get as grim and harrowing as the other versions...it's a great story,see all the versions!"
5,"Raves for Reginald ... Owen, that is.","With all the classic remakes of this most classic of Christmas stories, this 1938 version is still the best. Reginald Owen is a magnificent actor who must never be forgotten. He captures Dickens' Scrooge in a performance that is technicolor ... even in black and white. Supporting actors are vivid, the script is a perfect cinematic adaptation of the book and changes made for this screen story only serve to enhance the total experience. I have seen this film dozens of times and still laugh and cry in all the right places. Buy it before it disappears forever."
5,Awesome movie,This is by far the best movie ever and I watch it over and over again every year! love it!!!
5,A Christmas Carol-1937 version,"The 1937 version is more fun to watch than others simply due to the expressions on the faces of the actors. It might not be as true to the story as the 1951 version, but it is more fun. We enjoy watching both every Christmas season."
5,Good Experience,Good DVD .. love this movie . . always have and always will. Some people may think it is not as good as the A. Cooke one but it is sure a close second.
5,Don't Try to Remake an Original,"Unable to find this version two years ago, I disappointedly ended up with the highly-touted 1951 version. That version is not nearly as pleasing as the original, which I have been watching on TV for years. Thankfully, I finally got this version and I never have to watch another one again. This is by far the second best Christmas movie ever (A Christmas Story being the best, of course)."
5,A Christmas Carol DVD,"Fast service, good condition when it got here no problems, will probably order there again played great made my Christmas perfect"
1,Very poor quality,"The product was bought new. It arrived in great time. However upon playing the DVD, it freezes at different times, it moves ahead on its own. I have a excellent working DVD player that is clean. I tried this on a friend's DVD player with the same results.It was a great price however I can't play it so it was money down the drain."
5,Classic!,"One of my favorite versions of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol. The extra features were great, especially the powerful cartoon Peace On Earth! Excellent Holiday Classic!"
5,THIS IS THE BEST CHRISTMAS CAROL OF THEM ALL.,WHAT MORE CAN BE SAID ABOUT THIS VERSION EXCEPT THAT IT IS AMONG THE BEST AND IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE TO WATCH EVERY HOLIDAY SEASON.A MUST SEE TO APPRECIATE IT.
5,A true classic and a good version of A Christmas Carol,There are many versions of this movie out there but this is the best version. A must have for your Christmas collection. It brings out the best of the Christmas spirit.
4,A PLEASANT INTERPRETATION,"This is a happy interpretation of Dickens' A Christmas Carol. It was good to see the old familiar faces of Gene Hersholt, his wife as well as his daughter June who became a familiar actress in TV as well as movies. The movie is a somewhat brief version of Dickens' story but still worth viewing. Reginald Owen, a fairly well known actor in his day, made a good Scrooge with a great delivery of ""HUMBUG"". A warm and fuzzy rendition!"
5,A Family Holiday Tradition,"Although we enjoy the version staring Allister Sims more we still love this version and have made them a Xmas Eve viewing must. This year I upgraded both versions to DVD so my grandchildren can enjoy it for years to come. We all gather together with Hot Chocolate and snacks and watch both versions.Its hard to compete with the color Xmas movies that are newer yet we all so enjoy the black & white, the not so great special effects, and the great acting. It's the stories that count."
1,Awful,"I was determined not to compare this version to the 1951 ""Scrooge"" with Alastair Sim, but this one is so bad that it's pretty much impossible not to do so. Even the cartoon versions are better than this one. Some of the stories on here aren't bad, and Gene Lockhart as Bob Cratchit is good, as are his kids. But ultimately this movie really lacks the energy it needs to sustain such a story, especially the Marley character. There are too many important scenes that aren't even in this, while some of the other scenes are pure drivel.If this had been the first version I ever saw, I would never have watched another Scrooge or Christmas Carol ever again! Do yourself a HUGE favor and watch the 1951 version. Nobody can compare to Alastair Sim as Scrooge!"
5,Excellent story,I have retired this since I got it one DVD. I put a few miles on it before I retired it. I recommend it.
5,The Best!,This is my favorite Christmas Carol. It is so true to the original story. I have many versions and this by far is the best.
5,A Timeless Christmas Classic,"A Christmas CarolA Timeless Christmas Story of a an old stingy employer who finds Christmas and its meaning when visited by The Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future. These visits change him to a benevolent person who becomes what Christmas is all about - caring, giving, and kindness to your fellow man.There are more than one version of this story, but this one is equal to the rest. I like Tiny Tim in this version the best.No Christmas collection of movies should lack this one."
5,Review 20080112,I and my family have enjoyed this video for the holidays. This was a very good buy and the bonus features were even more appreciated.
1,Difficult read,"If you are looking for information that can be used immediately, this is not it. This is a difficult read in terms of the technical language, symbols, etc. Look for materials that is ready for the ""general"" public and not for an instructor."
3,Roux Lash & brow tint,I thought it would tint more than it does. I apply it with a lash brush and I've applied it with the applicators either way it didn't make it any thicker. would not buy this product again.
2,Its ok but....,"It burns wayyyy worse then any other tint Ive ever used and if you want really black lashes, you need to do this about 4 times in a row. Also...if you get ANY on your skin....be prepared to have it stay there for a while because the remover doesnt work."
4,a little pricey but still worth it,I had no problems with this product and was very satisfied. I will admit I have had practice using it when i was in cosmetology school though. As long as you don't get it on your skin it should work well.
1,Very disappointed!,"The consistency is too thin for eyebrows. It also stained my skin horribly & trying to remove it was extremely irritating, resulting in redness which lasted 2 days. I threw it right in the garbage."
1,Gutter Disappointment,I chose the black color wishing that it would darken my eyebrow color which is already light black. I was wrong.I saw no change at all. Zero. Big disappointment.
5,Love It!,"I have strawberry blonde hair with blonde eyebrows. Went to the salon a few times to dye my eyebrows but had to go back frequently to maintain the color. The Roux tint last a long, long time even when using on a regular basis (every couple of weeks). Much cheaper than the salon. BEWARE!!! The first couple of times using the tint is a little dramatic...follow the instructions carefully. Once you get the hang of it the results are not so shocking and both brows can be done in five minutes. I'm hooked!"
1,charlie chaplin eyebrows,"I have used this product several times, it always ends up staining my skin no matter how careful I am about applying the dye. The remover is somewhat helpful in removing the coloring from skin but it is extremely harsh.It does do a decent job coloring your eyebrows but it leaves the skin underneath quite dark."
5,why pay to have your lashes tinted,"I am a real blonde, so I have very light eyebrows and lashes - this product is wonderful - you have to be careful not to get into your eyes. Each tint lasts a good 4-6 weeks. The product seems to last about 4+ months before it goes bad - the first solution turns brown, and then you know its time for new batch.When I found out I might be going on TV's Survivor, and I couldn't wear any make up for long time, I paid $75 to have my lashes & brows tinted. Then I found this product in a beauty supply store and decided to try it myself. I live in Lake Tahoe, I'm outdoors a lot and this allows me to not use any masquera. This is about my 5th purchase of this product and I'm so glad I found it on amazon vs driving to a beauty supply place and paying more."
3,Deescription,"Valerie Jordan felt that her own life had ended with the death of her fiance, but she was wrong.Life -- and love -- beckoned to her once more in the person of Jonas Thorne. A man of moods, of bewildering arrogance and stunning tenderness, he made her his wife. His kisses gave her breath; his touch lit a fire in her, and with firm determination he led her into a future brighter than any she had ever known."
3,Good but beware ...,"When I first saw Zone of Enders - Idolo I was imediately impressed with the quality of the picture, story, sound and continuity (see my review for ZOE - Idolo). This was the reason I pre-ordered Dolores, i.I must say, however that this continuation really turned me off. Set years after the first OAV and video game the series seems to take a turn in the wrong direction. It seemed to lose something. Suddenly the frame (or mech) is not of the same caliber as the Idolo in the first OAV. It appears comical along with the main character Links. The music was changed and does not have the same emotion as Idolo did.If you are into the mech genre of anime, you may not be too disapointed. For those who are expecting a repeat performance of Idolo ... Beware."
2,molasses puffs,VERY DISAPOINTEDRECIEVED THEM ALL BROKE UP AND FOR THE MONEY GOT VERY LITTLE. WOULD NOT DO IT AGAIN!!
3,Turn Based Kills it...,"When i saw this game i was very excited because i had played the ps2 version of the game (which is great by the way) so i decided to pick this up... its not a bad game but Certainly not the best one the game being turn-based takes away the same action you have in the ps2 version, And Saving is much harder because you cant save during in-game battles or when your being attacked. Overall the gameplay is pretty good and the movement and fighting is simple and fun Overall its not so bad of a game. It Just has some little problems"
5,This dimmer was the perfect touch,I purchased a set of lights with a dimmer at one of those Big Box stores but ended up taking them back. This Good Earth Lighting dimmer and set of puck lights that I bought on Amazon for my kitchen curio cabinet is exactly what I was looking for. Very nice product and looks great with the lights mounted recessed and the wiring hidden. Hiding the transformers requires some planning but it's worth the effort. Couldn't be more pleased.
4,"Works well, had to replace one","We have been using three of these dimmers for about six years on a daily basis with lights under our kitchen cabinets. Recently I had to replace the transformer/controller on one of them, which required mounting the replacements from the kit and re-threading the wires. Overall, very satisfied with the product."
2,Kitaro an enchanted evening vol 1,"I have been an admirer of Kitaro and his music for many years,he writes for the soul,he is a genius. This DVD was unavailable here in Australia, so it was wonderful to view Kitaro in concert. I do have resevations on the Visual quaility of this DVD,however, Iwas very dissapointed to view a grainy, poorly produced DVD, it looks like a video tape copy to be honest, The Audio is fine, This transfer does not show Kitaro at his best, if you are prepared to view a poor transfer , if only to see this great artist at work, go for it, This cost me over A$50.00 to have the pleasure of owning this artist on DVD live. Come on Pioneer Entertainment you can produce good DVDs what went wrong with this one?"
3,music/interview/music/interview/music/interview,"Between each song, there are interviews with Kitaro. The interviews are done in a beautiful, scenic background and are nice for those who want to learn more about Kitaro. I wanted music only."
3,"Good performances, but....","...the story is a bit depressing overall. Sandra Bernhard is her great, tough/soft bitchy self, and Boston Public's Loretta Devine is wonderful (as usual) in a supporting role. Unless you are a die-hard fan of Sandra, Loretta or Kristy Swanson, I would pass on this movie."
5,Gothic Masterpiece,"What more can you ask for? This album has all the great works of Bauhaus. Most are their early works which are much much better than their last years together. This album is worth every cent. A true gothic masterpiece. Paranoia Paranoia, She's in Parties, Who Killed Mr. Moonlight? and Kick in the eye are just some of the reasons you should get this album. If you are going to buy only one Bauhaus album, Buy this one, you won't be disappointed!"
3,Save yourself some money...,"...Bauhaus is okay. But the only song on the album that I would give high marks to is Severance (Studio Version). Severance (Studio Version) is a unique and great song. The rest of the album is for big fans of Bauhaus, I guess...."
2,disappointed,"sure, Daves drumming is really good. But musicially, this is simply not entertaining at all. from all the raving reviews this record got, I thought it to be much better. this sounds like an intro to a TV-series most of the time, so polished that the groove is totally lost. This record hasn't aged well, to say the least. But who knows, you might like it, I didn't."
5,The holly Bible,"These is the fullest and most intensive listening clinic for all modern drummers of today.Going from one kind of tune to the other,and giving to all young drummers the challenge to imitate some of his works.For me after 9 years of studing seriously i am still listening new accents and inspirational tunes that help me in my playing in all kind of situations."
3,Good Fun,"Strange...GRP as a lable has probably produced more elevator music than jazz records in the last 20 years, however this CD (which I picked up in 1992 for the Anthony Jackson bass playing) is a nice surprise in that the surrounding musicians do a nice job laying structures over Dave Weckl drum work.-Good Soprano Sax throughout the CD-Great bass playing-If you can get passed the 90's synth-keys the playing is solid-Really well played guitar work dropped in and aroundSome of the songs are alittle bit grocery store jazz but it's a great CD for the car."
4,"70417, 3 channel rc airplane","The plane is big, so you do need a large open area to fly it. Assembly is required, for the wing and the stabilizers. You generally need to adjust the servos before you fly it to prevent any damage. When I recieved it and hooked it up, I had to adjust it because the elevator is to far down, and the rudder is to far to the right. You need to make sure that everything is ligned up properly to avoid damage because the plane does not fly properly. The instructions are translated, but they are not difficult to understand. It has a nice motor with plenty of power to get it into the air and climb quickly."
4,Fiction vs Fact,"Orbach's accounts are indeed fictional, and this is not made clear in the jacket copy. The stories, however are well written and interesting, and probably good approximations of the thoughts, words and feeling inside a therapy session. Many therapists have written fascinating and instructive accounts of their patients' case histories but have simply gotten permission to change the names and perhaps a few telling facts so that they are still a true refleciton of that case. For a good collection of fiction and non-fiction that illustrates the patient-therapist relationship, read Inside Therapy: Illuminating writings about patients, therapists and psychotherapy."
4,In therapy? Check it out . . .,"Actually led to a breakthrough in my degree of trust with my own therapist. Caveat emptor: it's FICTION, not accounts of actual cases. Nonetheless, it got me out of my narcissism long enough to realize that my therapist is indeed a human being with her own feelings. Wow!"
1,Disappointing Self-Absorption,"Numerous contemporary British psychotherapists, of which Orbach is one, have written compassionately and insightfully - for the lay person as well for pracitioners - on countertransference. Orbach has a clinical practice. Of course she is a good person who wants the best for her patients. But in a leap of faith, she has made up the stories, invented the patients. This is not about her clinical practice. It is about her. These fictional patients exist as vehicles by which we learn about Susie Orbach. Very disappointing. In addition, The book has been tarted up for publication and hoped-for sales by the use of the word ""sex"" in the title. We learn very little about her process, or even her respect for, interest in, or conflicts with with her (made-up) ""patients."" A hodge-podge. I came away feeling that in Orbach's view, the most compelling subject is - herself."
1,I... paid too much.....,It wasn't the scholarly piece of work I was looking for. Freud and Feminism just don't mix for me - but it seems to work for her.
5,Awesome Industrial Music!,"I discovered the joy of Helium Vola just over a year ago. ""Liod"" was my first album and of all the albums I now own, it's the one I constantly go back to. It's an industrial album with a lot of classical and operatic influences. I just cannot express in words how awesome Helium Vola are! I hate a lot of noisy bands and most industrial music, but Helium Vola cannot be classified as just industrial. They are classical, opera, and gothic. Some tracks are great because it's just sounds thrown together and it makes sense. Others, like ""Lucente stella"", is a beautiful rendition by Sabine Lutzenberger. Listen with the lights off and this CD will take you far away from reality."
4,Works Good,"The remote works well. Definitely gives a boost to the bass. Only problem I have is that by using the remote, it sends distortion to my subs and burns my voice coils so I can't really use the remote. But it works well. gives a good boost to your system"
2,blahh,i bought and installed this hoping it would boost the bass output but both knobs on the remote dont do much at all it just changes the tone so you can hear music not bass! only thing i like about it is that it has a blue light on it which looks cool at night... all in all not worth the 30 bucks!
5,Good cowbell holder,"Works great, tho you have to get feet set right, otherwise it will walk on you.Frees up your hands and as long as you can keep the foot pattern stable, you cant tell the difference."
5,A great strategy guide,"This is a great strategy guide if you want to know all the secrets, weapons, and vehicles in this game. This guide tells you everything you need to know so I would definitely recomend this book to anyone who plays Halo."
3,"Good for the easier difficulties, but could be better","I was rather disappointed by this book. I expected good advice, and helpful walkthroughs. The walkthroughs were ok, if you are playing on Easy. The maps of the single-player and multiplayer levels were good. The ""helpful"" tips section would only really be useful for someone who has never played a FPS before, with gems like ""if you move around, you are a tougher target"". It does have nice sections about the vehicles, weapons, multiplayer maps, and gametypes. The walkthrough itself is only useful on Easy or maybe Normal. If you are trying to beat Legendary, this is not the book for you. Go buy Halo 2 instead."
2,depends,"If you are just going to play single player there is no reason for this book. However, if you are playing multiplayer this book is halpful for the maps, but you can probably find those online."
4,good strategy guide,"I found this strategy guide to be very helpful and easy to follow. I'd suggest playing through the game's easy mode without the guide, and then using it on the more difficult levels. But that's just my opinion."
3,Do you really need this?,"My review isn't a slam on people that use cheat books like some of the reviews here. But, the game flows so smoothly, I just wouldn't see why you would need one. The game pretty much only gives you one option in which way to go next. Either every thing else is blocked, or all the other doors are locked. I liked that because I don't like games that you have to run all over just to figure out where to go next. There is even a level in the middle of a swamp. I thought I would have a tough time figuring that out, but there are lights here and there that kinda show you the way. Very good game. If you are thinking of getting this, get it. I just had a friend over who has a PS2, and is thinking of getting an XBox just for this one game. That's how great it is!!!"
1,Dont get it,The guide for halo is not usefull because the game is easy enough to beat without it. Its only good if youre really really really stuck which is almost impossible. Dont get it.
1,Hahahaha.,"Are you serious about playing games? Are you sure, POSITIVELY SURE, that you want to be told, much like a small child, how to play this game?C'mon. Get skillz. Play the game without the guide and people will know you learned how to play on your own....Totally clueless?Why do you own an Xbox?"
1,"A simplified walkthrough, no strategy","This guide may be helpful for someone playing on Easy, but on Legendary you have to have a strategy. A strategy, is not included in this guide. An excerpt from the guide: ""Two more troop carriers show upalmost simultaneously, in spots thathave already hosted alien infestations.You know what to do."" For those who know the game, troop carriers are equipped with 2-3 Elites, 2-4 Jackals, and 6-7 Grunts, one troop carrier is difficult to get past, but two is almost impossible. 'You know what to do' is their suggestion on how to get past this difficult part(on Legendary). I would not recommend this guide at all. The only thing helpful is at the very beginning, where it lists some effective weapons, and it has maps of the levels, other then that, there is no guide."
1,No Reason To Get It,Wow. Who'd be dumb enough to buy this when you could go to bungie.net and look at the walkthrough there? Even on Legendary Halo's not that hard.
2,Bleck!!! not good!,this is just like an extream when a stranger calls (much much better movie). the idea is really good but its low budget and not suspensful. i thought about turning this movie off twice. once in the very begining when you osee two little kids get stabbed and tied together (disturbing and sad) and in the end. people keep saying that its great to see the star get nude but you see her chest because she's tied up and seeing her friends get killed and the killer walkes over and opens her shirt and forces her boyfriend to basicaly assult her. the acting was really not good. the most i can give this not very suspensul and deffinatly not scary movie is two stars.
1,Terrible,"If you see the name Asylum on the back of your movie's box, put it back immediately. This company makes Ed Wood look genius. Its sad that they churn out these flicks to try to cash in on a similiar movie playing in a theater."
4,good movie,"I was told this was a Campy movie of a copy of when a stranger calls.What is a campy movie,anyway? It has cute guys, Pretty girls running around,or standing there in fright.I couldn't wait to see someone kick the killers butt.Girl power!Plus,why didn't the girl turn the killer in,call the police when he made advances on her in the past? I'm still waiting for a sequel to when a stranger calls the remake.But,this'll do for now.I love the guy from ""One tree hill""Robert Buckley, being in it.Just like ""A stranger calls"",the teenager babysitting gets a series of phone calls and finds out their coming from inside the house!!!!When A Killer Calls"
3,have i seen this before?,wasn't there a movie like this in the early 80s? it starred carol kane as the baby sitter? a typical horror movie.
2,very nice..... but there is a problem,Ok. First think is that the shipping took for ever I ordered them on the the april 12 they came therefore 21st of april so shiping was bad. Also that when they came right out of the package and I put them on my shirt one of the pin holders falls out ever time I put it on..... bottom line these ar very nice I don't know what was up with the shipping. And the pins are pretty much crap.
3,polished silver military bars,They appear to be cheaply made. They appear to be Navy Lt bars rather than Army Captain insignias. Got quality bars at other source.
1,Unmasking The New Age,"Sorry, but I have read many books on this subject and although he may have written this book for all the right reasons, I cannot believe some of the stuff he says in his book. Especially about Rock N Roll. If it had not been for the group Petra which he blatently calls Ocult or devil worshippers, I would have never been able to embrace the Love and Grace of God. He claims they made devil horns like what is done in Rolling Stones or Led Zepplin concerts and what he saw was the symble for I love you in sign language. I've been to many of their concerts and that is the sign language they use for I Love You. I would recommend however, Evangelising The New Age, Invasion Of Other God's both excellent books in this area. Sorry, I would't be given this book again even if somebody dropped it on my door."
5,Brings Back Memories,Flying House brings back memories of watching this and Superbook as a child. It is definitely worth buying and watching again!
2,this is NOT a shoe!,"Be warned, it is hard to tell but this is a DECORATION. not a true wearable shoe. sad to say because I would love a pair like this but it is just a shelf shoe. very neat if someone you know is obsessed with shoes though."
4,life,Good book about how God has given us His power after the New Birth to overcome sin and live the Christian Life.God wants the new Christian to long for the milk of His word so they may grow thereby.Recommend for new born believers in Jesus Christ.
5,I wish I would have read this when I was saved...,"This books deeply explains what being a Christian truly means.Andrew Murray continues to be one of my favorite writers. I bought this for my friend who was recently converted, to study together.Excellent book. Highly recommended to Christian's of any maturity level."
5,Beautiful Tribute to a Pioneer,"The influence of Scandinavian design in the United States, if not in the whole world has been immense. The clean simple lines of functional design pioneered over there have influenced more designs than have been built in Scandinavia. Gunnar Asplund is one of the lessor known (in the United States) architects of Scandinavian design.Born in 1885, he began his career in 1907 with a small villa. A few years later he won his first competition for a school which launched his professional career. From then until his death in 1940 he designed a range of structures that reach from small homes through large commercial/government/public buildings. They remain classics of their type.This profusely illustrated book is unusual in that it includes not only photographs of the buildings as they exist now, but also many line drawings that illustrate the original concepts. As such this is both a tribute to his designs and an idea book for designs being made today."
2,Disappointed,"I have always loved these chips and buy them often at the grocery store. Since Amazon offered them at a very good price I purchased a case, However, upon receipt I was disappointed and immediately notified the company (Garden of Eatin). They were not as good as the ones in the grocery store (they seemed to be darker and greasier)and I wondered if they were old. The expiration date indicates they are fine. I do not dislike them, though I love the store ones, and have decided to keep them. Salsa can fix anything. However, I will not purchase them again in bulk from Amazon. My biggest disappointment has been that the company never responded to my email."
1,Oily taste,"These chips were disappointingly oily tasting and somewhat stale, even out of a freshly opened bag. I even opened a second bag to make sure it wasn't just a fluke. The chips are crisp enough, but taste like they were fried in old oil."
2,sesame blues chips,"My husband really likes seaseme chips so I ordered 12 packages, however I only got a 11 packages and all were crushed. This was a very bad job packing box and shipping. I won't order again."
1,Broken Chips,"These are great chips! I also like the red chips. UNFORTUNATELY, Amazon ships these out in the vendor boxes which are very flimsy. All of the chips end up broken.It's so funny -- everything else Amazon sends out is in rugged Amazon boxes -- sometimes the item inside is in the vendor box so you get double protection. The items that should be double boxed (chips) don't get any protection at all and they are the most fragile."
5,Meant to rate this two stars,I bought the wrong item. These chips were disappointing. The regular Garden of Eatin' Black Bean tortilla chips are high in fiber (4 grams) but these chips are only 2 grams. Sorry I bought them.
5,yummy...,"if you try these you may not go back to the 'other' big name brand of nacho cheese chips, I buy these by the case.....really good! To all these people that say they got stinky, sticky or stale chips ..if you didn't get them replaced you still don't know how good these chips are so your reviews are invalid and of no use. Spoiled, stale food products can be purchased from anywhere so you just take it back or return it and get another fresh replacement... as I said I buy these by the case and it took me and family couple months to finish them all and they were absolutely good to the last chip!"
5,I Just got my order on Dec 3 2012 and it clearly says NON GMO,Just got my order on Dec 3 2012 and it clearly says NON GMO. These taste great and they are organic. I guess my eyes are still young enough to properly read the label.
2,most of the chips were in very very small pieces bad shipping,chips were very good but there must have been a shipping problem all the chips were in small pieces
3,Nature goodness,Really great tasting chips. I really did not expect them to be as hard as they were. Good if they are cover with a cheese sauce.
2,"Good, as long as they are still fresh","I bought these chips in May 2009, and they were best eaten by 9/12/2009. When I first got them, they were very tasty and exactly what I had expected. I would have rated them 4 or 5 stars then.However starting in early August, there was a definite odd taste that was starting to creep into the chip. And here in early September they are totally inedible. My guess is that the oils used have gone rancid in the chip, since they are using natural oils. Normally this is a very good thing, but the longevity of the product is sacrificed due to it, which is a problem when you are buying chips in 12 bag packages!So if you are purchasing these chips please make sure you are able to eat them quickly, they will not be any good about 1 month before the best eaten by date. I had to throw away about 5 bags...."
4,a little too salty for my tastes....but....,"I liked everything about this chip except they are too salty... I accomodated by making my gracamole, and other dips salt free. Balanced them out. Texture is wonderful, great corn taste. I brush excess salt off with a paper towel if I just want to snack dip free. I won't buy again simply because I don't need 12 bags to have to ""clean"" before eating. I will try their salt or low salt varieties though as it really is a stellar chip on it's own."
3,"Garden of Eatin' Tortilla Chips, Blue, No Salt Added, 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)","This is a good product, BUT, buy the larger bags. They are the better value. These are excellent for anyone who must limit their salt intake."
4,"Sodium: 120mg, not 70mg as reported by Amazon","Just received my shipment. Tasty chips, but as my title says, they have 120mg of sodium which is almost double the amount listed by amazon on the product page."
4,you won't miss the salt,"I ordered these chips by accident. I meant to order ""with added salt."" I know, not a healthy choice but hey, I love salt! So, I ended up with a whole case of these unsalted chips. My wife said, hey these aren't salted! She was pleased. She worries about my diet. So, I had some chips. They're delicious! Good crunch. Very fresh corn flavor. Excellent with salsa. Sometimes a guy has to be wrong to do right!"
1,"Rancid/Stale Chips, DO NOT BUY!!!","I purchased these chips on October 18, 2010. They were rancid/stale so you can certainly believe the other reviewers. I had not noticed the reviews about the horrible taste and staleness of these chips. I wish I had. I contacted customer service for a refund which they approved but I think Amazon should either stop selling these chips due to such poor reviews or check their stock to make sure they are FRESH. If you order, you should order with caution. I am trying another brand instead of reordering these."
2,Stale Stale Stale!!,"If you regularly buy these chips, you would be like me and say, ""that's a great deal!"" These chips are not cheap at the stores, but they are fresh. The expiration date is not past when you receive your big box... but for some reason they are not fresh, and the salt on the chips is all at the bottom. I kept thinking that it was ""just that one bag..."" but it was all of them. I had eaten too many of them to send them back. Do not buy this product from Amazon- but... my shipment may be the unlucky one that was stale- although i read several other reviews sharing my opinion... and i did not believe!"
1,Literally Stink,I've order the Seasame Blues before and thought they were great. The 7.5 ounce bags are round compared to the triangles. When you open the bag you get a strong odor of bad oil. The taste also has the bad oil to it. Unfortunately I sent a box to my sister after bragging about them. I called company but no word yet.
1,STALE Tasting!,"don't be fooled and misled by believing these chips are ""healthier"" or ""better for you"". Same fat grams and calorie content...but what is worse, is that they taste stale, not enough nacho flavor and are so hard!"
1,Deceptive packaging-it does have GMO ingredients,"Either these folks are completely ignorant or they think putting "" no genetically engineered ingredients"" on the front of the package will cause us to to ignore their list of ingredients on the back. Canola oil is made from genetically modified rapeseed. They also say it may have Safflower or Sunflower oil, but I'drather not take part in that lottery. I'd like to send back this lot, but I'm not willing to bet, they would not have the nerve to sell it to the next unsuspecting soul, so it will go straight into the trash can ,where it belongs."
1,Rancid and Nauseating,"I would have liked to actually taste this product, but as soon as the bag was opened I was attacked by the stench of rancid oil. The product was still 5 weeks away from the ""Best if used by"" date, so that's no excuse. And it's not likely they were shipped in a hot truck, it being the middle of winter. On further research, I discovered there's a good chance that any Garden of Eatin' chip product you buy will be rancid. So much for ""organic""."
1,blue chips,The chips are okay Not near as flavorful as the regular blue chips. Nice size bag for a family.
5,My Favorite Torilla Chips,I tried these chips about 4 years ago before the blue corn tortilla chips were popular. The second I finished eating one chip I knew I would be a customer for life. These are absolutely amazing. I wish all of the ingredients were organic but i won't be too picky. The 12 bags are quite a bit to get in one order but it is much cheaper than getting it at a local store. If you like to entertain these would be a good idea to keep handy for a more healthy option for your guests. I love these little guys. I would recommend to anyone.
1,Taste really stale,We had ordered this chips before and really loved them in the past. For some reason our last order (despite not being expired until December of 2010) has tasted horrible and stale. I am really considering whether I'll order them again.
2,Terribly Stale,Chips arrived prior to expiration date but they taste terrible. They have a bizzare stale / cardboard like flavor.
