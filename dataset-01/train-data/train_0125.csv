5,Very Easy Towel Changes,"This paper towel holder is excellent. Our previous holder had a heavy, screw off top. It was easy to drop and just a general pain when it came to changing the roll of towels. This Simplehuman Quick Load Paper Towel Holder is simply fantastic. In one quick motion, I am able to pinch and remove the top. The roll goes on, and then I can quickly place the top right back. It also stays in place quite firmly when I lift without pinching the buttons. Overall, I am very happy with this product, and I would definitely recommend it to others."
5,"solid, heavy product","Looks great, easy to use one-handed, easy to replace the roll, happy with it, glad I didn't get one of the over-engineered ones with a gripper arm. Not necessary, this works just fine."
4,Paper Towel Holder,"This is a terrific item with great looks and style. It is heavy enough that it does not fall over when you pull on a paper towel. I ordered this one as it looked very similar to one that I had once owned. The other one had a ""brake release"" style button on top that allowed me to push down and stop the towels from rolling. This one works very well, though."
5,Very nice looking and works well,"I've seen other people use the wooden ones before. They do look nice but they tend to be not heavy enough to stay still when you pull out a tissue. This thing looks great and has a nice heavy base which means it stays put when you pull out a tissue. The construction is very good quality and I also like the fact that they chose to go with a detachable, spring loaded top. This makes sure that there is no chance the roll will come off the top."
5,The Best. Period.,"Unless someone invents a paper towel holder that tears and hands you a sheet itself, until then, in my opinion this is the best one yet. It's heavy enough to hold its position even with my rough yanking. It takes 2 secs to reload. The raised edge and cool design are extra pluses. I'm thinking of buying one more for the bathroom."
4,"simplehuman Quick Load Paper Towel Holder, Stainless Steel",It looks good and works well. It seems sturdy. I have no problems with it. Better than the one it replaced.
5,Great Product!,"I really love it. It's heavy so it stays in place, looks great, and is easy to replenish with more paper towels. There's no more knocking off the paper holder.. I really like this product :)"
5,easy to use,I like how easy it is to change rolls; and the weight is nice so it doesn't slide across your countertops.
3,""" Single handedly ""","the product description is accurate with this product.stable base, eazy reload, etc.the one dissapointment i have is that it is difficult to tear off one sheet with ""one"" hand.one handed keeps the rest of the paper unmessy.it also looks better tearing off a sheet one handed....stupid paper towel holder"
1,What a mess!,"After only three months, the non-slip material on the base of simplehuman KT1021 Quick Load Paper Towel Holder that I purchased has disintegrated. The disintegrating material stuck to my granite countertop and was difficult to remove. I purchased this paper towel holder based on it's excellent reviews and the reputation of other simplehuman products, and am very disappointed."
5,Paper towel holder is the best!,This is the BEST papertowel holder ever! I have had several before and this one by far out performs all of them. It also holds the oversized paper towels! Fantastic product and would highly recommend!!!
5,Great product,This towel holder is perfect for a countertop. It is made well and looks great. It goes very well with my stainless steel and black kitchen appliances.
5,Another happy customer,"Bought this after viewing the video clip one of the early reviewer posted (a lady, I believe, thank you!). So happy. I have been using a crappy holder for long, long time. It is almost feel like the old holder was a patient and you have to constantly paying attention to it. With this holder, the patent is gone - discharged. I could not be more happier with it."
2,Not............,"I guess i'm not a home mom type, but i've tried to be. But i bought this and when i try to do it, i have to use alot of strength in order to get the onion through. And i got hurt by doing it. i don't like it and only used it once."
3,Great product until it breaks........,I am on my second Chop Wizard. It is an excellent chopper until it breaks. Both of mine broke where the lid attaches to the base. I was chopping an onion smaller than what is in their product picture when it snapped. I will see if Amazon will replace although I've had it for over six months...
2,Nice but doesn't last,"I was given this chopper as a gift. I found it incredibly handy, however, after only using it a few times the plastic piece on the side of the contianed that the lid attaches to broke off and now I cant use it. I can't find a customer service or help option for letting the inventor know and I am dissapointed it did not last long at all. I even was very careful to soend the time cutting onions and things into a little bit smaller pieces, not chopping them whole. Don't waste your money."
1,Broke in 2 weeks,"As many others have stated, the hinges are a weakness with this item. Mine broke within 2 weeks, while chopping quartered onions.My wife tried to contact the manufacturer for a replacement (we got this as a gift), but their website offers no details about returns/replacements, warranty, etc."
4,could be made a little sturdier,"I really do want to give this product five stars, but I have had to replace mine twice because the little plastic pieces that hold the top in place have broken. That being said, I have replaced it twice, because it is truly a time saver. It chops just as advertised. Yes, you do have to slice the onion in half before putting it in the chopper, but that takes no time at all. I use this at least three times a week. A breeze to clean in the dishwasher. This is one of the few ""as seen on T.V."" products that actually work!"
4,Works well for most uses,"We have used this product for a few months now and it does a great job on most vegetables. However, I wouldn't recommend using it to chop carrots or other hard vegetables. If you do, use both hands when pressing down."
2,Doesn't chop much but onions...,"Hmm, for the time it takes to get this out of the cupboard and considering the cleanup, it's kind of a waste. I mean, it will chop an onion, IF you quarter it first, but otherwise I have not found much else it will work on, without getting teeny little pieces stuck in the squares. I tried it for celery: no go. Green pepper is fine, but carrots don't fare too well either. Like I said, you need to quarter the vegetables first, but then since you already have the knife and are CUTTING, you might as well continue cutting/chopping with the knife. What are you saving, time? Not much. Effort? Not really.Totally unnecessary tool."
3,DO NOT BUY,"This book offers some insightful information although i don't think the value is really worth it. Here is a suggestion , go to the library and try to find it there. If you want to be cheap. Start here. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. DO NOT EVEN BUY IT USED!! The reason you can't save money is because of poor investments like this one. Stay away. If you want to know why you can't save money ...it's because of poor choices like this one"
2,Yikes!,"The good: an attractive lead and a storyline that had potential. The bad: everything else!If you want to see what a high school film class project looks like - this is the movie for you.Members of the film crew weren't actually knocking over the scenery or stumbling into the shots during filming, but it would not have made the movie any worse if they had."
5,The Best Cub Album,"This is my favorite Cub album. While the production isn't stellar (everything sounds muffled), this album has some of their best songs. ""New York City"" is a great song which was later covered by They Might Be Giants. Some other I like are ""Everything's Geometry,"" ""Tomorrow Go Away,"" and ""I'm your angel."" Their cover of the Go-Go's ""Vacation"" works really well.I would compare Cub to Tiger Trap, but not as sugary, or to Sleater-Kinney without the punk."
3,Good but not great,"The cd player is inexpensive and it does its job for normal listening. Since it's cheap, there is not any cd skip protection so joggers look elsewhere. Also, the buttons aren't that sensitive so you have to press them firmly. Other than that, you get your money's worth."
3,OK for the money,"I bought this model because I wanted something that would play CD's and I woundn't get too upset if I dropped it or had it stolen. It doesn't have any of the anti-skip features..if it does they don't work. It tends to skip if you walk around with it or grab it with any pressure on the cover. However, it does just fine in the car or sitting on top of my stair stepper. Just as well as the Sony model I've had for the past 5 years that just quit on me. Hope this helps."
3,decent but not great,it works decently and has a nice bass. but it does skip excessively at every little touch so not very effective for jogging or for cars. it does make noises while it plays but it's not too loud.
2,Totally Bustable,"This CD player is ""Totally Bustable"". It skips a lot, its colors are gruesome,it has only 8 buttons,(only 5 worked on mine), and I dropped it from litterally 1'2"" on carpet, and it broke!! Toys R Us wouldnt even give me a new one! It was the 4th day after I bought it, and my brother acctedenally hit it with a basketball when I was sitting on my front ledge of the driveway from 1'2"" high! This product isn't very good at all."
2,Get something else,"I have had this CD player for two years. In the first year, I was very happy with it. It had good bass, nothing could make it skip, and everything worked wonderfully. However, in the second year, things started to happen. First, the anti-skip disappeared. Then, the buttons reversed. Finally, two weeks ago, I dropped it from a height of FOUR INCHES. Now, the tone is often completely off if it is held in certain positions, and there is annoying background noise somtimes. This seems to be a good CD player at first - but it has no durability or lifespan. Get something else."
2,Waste of Money,"This product is not durable, breaks easily and eats your batteries! Mine failed to work and can no longer read the cds, they spin with no sound. The buttons do as someone mentioned, get confused-- it goes back a song instead of going forward. Save your money and buy something else!"
3,you'll get by,this cd player is pretty good. it does however have some minor problems such as the fact that some times the buttons get mixed up. what i mean by that is that some times when you hit the button for the next track it'll stop the cd. or sometimes you'll hit the previous track and it'll go to the next one. the paint or whatever also rubs off really easily. also there's no skip protection so it's no good for jogging or walking or even moving in any shape or form. but if you have to go on a long trip or something like that it'll get you by. battery time isn't too bad either.
4,"""Good Sci-Fi Sequel!""","Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong andRobert Patrick star in James Cameron's 1991 sci-fi sequel.A cyborg is sent from the future to protect a woman andher son from a liquid-metal assassin. This is a good sequeland I still have the ultimate edition dvd, but decided toupgrade to this. I was concerned before buying it afterreading reviews about the grain issues. There is some,but I have to say most of the film is clear as can be,colors look nice, sound is great and there's interactiveextras. It's definitely a step up from the dvd and probablythe best it's going to look & sound for now considering thefilm is over 20 years old. I recommend this and if you stillhave the ultimate dvd, keep it for the extras if you like thatsort of thing like me."
4,Same as the DVD version,"This is NOT the Ultimate version. There is one Blu-ray disc in the package. The content of the disc is the same as the older DVD.While the video and sound track are better due to Blu-ray technology, it is essentially the same disc you may already have in your collection."
5,The ultimate sequel.,"Terminator 2 - Judgment Day is the ultimate sequel ever! Sequels always tend to let me down but not this one in any shape or form. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, and Edward Furlong bring so much energy and fire to this film. James Cameron is a brilliant writer/director, he pulls out all the stops. I highly recommend this classic, you'll watch it over and over again, enjoy!"
5,The perfect sequel,This is how to make a follow up. T2 pushes the envelope at every level and thrills all over the place. The sfx are incredible - worth every penny of the $100m+ budget.A brilliant action movie. Everyone should own it.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys
5,"""How were we supposed to know?""","Well, almost everyone knows that T2 is a kick@$$ film by the brilliant director James Cameron. And it's true that this sequel far surpasses the original (though I did like the darker and creepier tone of the original). Cast have done an excellent job (especially Robert Patrick as the T-1000, and Joe Morton as Miles Dyson). Special Effects are spectacular, and they are much more realistic than today's effects. Music and cinematography are intriguing. And finally, the Extreme DVD is a big plus (picture and sound quality are perfect), though I might have to buy the Ultimate Edition for the special features.A+++"
3,Nice but not much better than the SD DVD,"It looks and sounds just a bit better than 1991...but not much. No special additional features, not a 'remastering'. But worth the $11 I paid here at Amazon."
2,DVD quality at best,"Anyone with a upconverting DVD player, or just a Blu-ray / PS3 will get the same quality of picture from the standard DVD. The transfer of this movie would need to be cleaned up digitally before it will be up to what Blu-ray can show. It's truely shocking the difference in quality between the menue footage which is true 1080p and fresh VS the lower grade transfure from the film with no digital clean-up. Anyone with the standard DVD should just save their money."
1,Commentary by Arnold Schwarzenegger????,"THE ONLY REASON I BOUGHT THIS 'SPECIAL EDITION DVD' WAS FOR THE ""Commentary by Arnold Schwarzenegger"". WELL, HE SPEAKS IN 3 PLACES ON THE COMMENTARY TRACK FOR A TOTAL OF 77 SECONDS. WOW, THAT WAS WORTH 27 BUCKS + shipping!"
5,Terminator 2 DVD,It's a classic Schwarzenneger movie. I watch it over and over. I would recommend it to any one who likes action moties.
4,looks cool,it probably wont be marked down with it being limited .It will probably go the other way as it becomes harder to get hold of.I cant resist it with being a big T2 fan the skull looks cool.Id much rather have the first and 3rd films inside it along with T2 rather than dvd releases of the same film though.
4,From someone who actually pre-ordered the Collector's Set,"No need to comment about the movie itself, we all know it is great. I've also pre-ordered the Skynet edition and already have the Extreme Edition so don't need the discs either. So why pay more than a hundred bucks for a plastic (I think) head? Because (1) I really like the movie; (2) it is an instantly recognisable icon; (3) good conversation starter; and (4) it would make a great accent piece for my video collection. Minus one star for the many T2 editions and price being on the high side."
4,Fox and Blu Ray,"I have the ULTIMATE edition of T2 in DVD and I adore it, I really hope the next BluRay edition is at least this good.I've been reading BluRay reviews since the first BluRays came out, I can't help but noticing that complains about transfers, lack of extras and poor quality Blu Rays always come from the very same source; FOX.Examples: DieHard, Predator, The hunt for the red october, Commando and now T2I think there should be some pressure from retailers like Amazon to make FOX put a little more effort in packing quality material into BluRays. Otherwise, what's the point of investing money in BluRays?"
2,disapointing,please do not make the mistakeof buying from these people as I have.I am a movie collector and the copy of T2 will not play in my dvd player. I have e-mailed them twice and they have not replyed to either.
4,T2 Limited Edition -- for GEEKS!!,"Although totally plastic ... the T2 Limited Edition 'bust' looks great on a shelf for display purposes only -- The lighted eyes and movie sounds are a nice ""geek"" touch! It comes with a typical 'clam shell' disc storage case, so you can keep your discs neatly alongside your other movies. Recommended!!"
5,10/10,"THIS FILM ROCKS. About time thisCOMES OUT, SPEACIAL EDITION DVD STYLE. THANKS, now I have to try to sell my normal dvd version to some numb scull. Anyways I nearly blew a brain vesal when I found out this was coming out. Arnold is the King, and I can't wait to hear him try and do a commentary.This disk is packed which extra's. no all they need to do is bring out special editions of total recall, predator, running man and the rest of his ass kicking movies.That's it, I'm going now to go buy this film.Peace OUt GO SUNS!"
5,More features than you can shake a stick at!!!!!,"Any serious DVD fan must own a copy of this disk. Along with 3 versions of the film you get countless ""making offs"", pages of production notes with interesting information, and trailers showing how the film was marketted in several stages to avoid giving the fact of Arnie was in fact a good guy. There is also a rather nifty THX trailer which all adds up to the make this the best DVD on the market. And it all comes complete with a swanky metal collectors case. Forget Men In Black, this is the one to own."
5,Fantastic in many ways.,A great sci-fi thriller about two cyborgs from the future: One's trying to kill a little boy who will be aresistance fighter in the future the other's trying to stop him. Arnold's defining movie. Non-stop action! Great story as well. Amazing special effects (mostly the T-1000). A must-see.
5,A very cool movie 10x the Budget will Knock Your Socks off,Not as good as First yet better then all the Robocop's Combined and The T1000 is a Wow.
5,the best movie ever made.Period!!,"This is by far Arnold's best performance and in my opinion the greatest special effects thriller ever made. Its story line is water tight, and it is more scientifically sound than the average Sci-fi flick.>>Big up Grenada<<"
3,"Mediocre HD transfer, not much extra.","There's little reason to grab this over the standard DVD version. The transfer is fuzzy and details are not particularly sharp; granted, it's from 1992 and wasn't exactly filmed in HD to begin with, but I was expecting more out of it than this. The extras treatment is very bare bones, repeating the same commentaries from before and adding little in the way of additional materials. Fortunately it's cheap, but don't expect much."
4,Amazon has confused the reviews,"I bought this thinking it was a third release of T2. I had the ""other"" edition and reading these reviews thought this was the one with three versions. NOPE! The one I had was actually the ""Ultimate Edition"". This is just ""Extreme"" :rolleyes: (It's #2 of the 3 different versions).Simply put: when you buy this, realize it is NOT the ""Ultimate Edition"" referred to the reviews below and will not have the ""Special Extended Version"" of T2. Amazon usually puts a warning when a review is based on a different version, but failed to do so this time. ""Forewarned is fore-armed"" as my mum used to say :)As for T2? Well, ANY version is gonna be sweet... :)"
4,Awesome DVD. Not without problems for me.,"My problem is with the Special edition only. Theatrical and Easter egg edition work fine. The problem is, at the point near the end when the Terminator is being lowered into the steel and dies you see his view and the horizontal red line goes to a red dot on the middle of the screen indicating he is history, there is a chapter change. This resets my machine and starts the DVD over from like a fresh bootup. It could be my first generation Panasonic 300 DVD player I don't know. If anyone is having this problem, please email me at mkar@xtdl.com"
2,Not as good as the original,"Even though this movie had a far greater budget than the original it failed to impress me. Schwarzenegger is really annoying as the cyborg with a heart and so is linda hamilton, as the freedom fighter who is a ""couple of cans short of a sixpack"". It lacks the grit and suspense of the original. The scene where arnold fires thousands of bullets at the police without killing any of them is painfully reminiscent of The A-Team! The only plus points for this film were Incredible special effects and Robert Patrick as the cold blooded T1000."
5,JUST BUY IT,This is the best DVD arround just buy it. Lost of information about the movie. Makes you respect much more the work of the people behind the camara.
3,"What I could view was good, but...","Imagine the surprise, when opening the box, to find a note stuck inside: ""Due to the advanced features utilized in the creation of this DVD, some players may experience minor navigational difficulties. This should not affect your enjoyment of the feature program in any way."" I have a SONY DVP-S530D, which is not an old model at all, yet was unable to view all features advertised on the box. The THX web site states that their products ""...are fully compatible with all video and audio playback systems."" I guess not. I consider this to be a disappointing lack of professionalism from Lucasfilm."
4,The pinnacle of 90's action movies stands the test of time,"17 years later, it is surprising how well Terminator 2: Judgment Day stands the test of time. The theatrical release (which is reviewed here) is better than the Director's Cut or Ultimate Edition because the movie flows better, inane dialogue and bad story elements that were better left out are still omitted.The central theme of the movie is the value of human life; it sets itself up well and is an example of Director James Cameron's finest works (another being Titanic (1997)). The heroes and villains contrast well with each other, in a movie made before more modern yarns where you can't tell who belongs with which side.The movie is rated R, so expect cursing, blood and violence."
5,Better than the 1st one,"This one is way better than the 1st Terminator,alot of stunts and explosives, the special effects are way better than the first one,on the 1st one u could kind of tell its a computer but on this one u cant.T2 Extreme is really worth watching if u action fan,girls even like this movie.One of my fav action movies ever.*****"
1,Region crippled - ridiculous,Can't play it. Greedy Hollywood company has added region coding crippling to the disc so that Australians and other overseas customers can't watch it.Inexcusable.And they wonder why people resort to p1racy.
5,to MATT,How can u criticize lindas character the woman just found out her sound is going the lead the remainded of the people left over from the end of the world. you expect her to be a wilting flower? all the bad that happened to her made her a stronger woman not a lot of people are willing to go to the lengths she went to for her son. i liked her character more in the 2nd movie..
3,Movie was great presentation was not.,"I tested out Amazon Prime streaming service and it was ok. The movie still had some jerkiness and I have a 10mbps download connection. But I am just picky and prefer the BD Skynet addition better. Most people would be happy with this streaming but I feel people (like me) in the niche dedicated Home theater segment, will not."
3,"Good, But Not Up To The Brilliance Of The First Film","I liked t2 but t1 is better. It has better music, better future scenes, better action scenes, etc. The acting in both in both films is fabulous, but I preferred Arnold as the bad guy."
1,Marketing ploy - not worth the extra $$$,"The Extreme edition is clearly a marketing ploy targeted to bring in extra $$$ with the upcoming T3 release. The so-called improved picture in the Extreme edition is not noticeable compared to the Ultimate edition. The Ultimate edition contains more versions of the movie and also has the DTS soundtrack that the Extreme edition lacks. If you already own the Ultimate edition, don't waste your money on the Extreme edition."
2,If you can get it to work,"i bought this because im a huge termiantor fan...i ahve the ultimate edition but i was looking forward to the T2 FX studio feature on the DVD. i isntalled the fotware which is REQUIRED in order to acess the DVD i keep gettting this message ""The DVD navigator was not detected. If you don't have one installed, you will need to upgrade your system. Otherwise, try to reinstall your DVD Navigator. "" i ahve updated my drivers and frimware and still no solution..."
5,Great Movie!,"Terminator 2 is very suspenseful with a lot of action. I like seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger on the good side. The movie also has funny parts. I like all the Terminator movies and I bought them because my son wanted to watch them after seeing Terminator 2, 3D at Universal Orlando. The cyborgs can do cool stuff and the bad one is made of liquid metal."
3,Let Down,"First things first the movie is great, awesome picture and sound. However the bust that this came with is... CHEAP!! Seriously the quality is something that I would see at a Toys R Us for $19.99The detailing on the bust is amateur at best. The shadowing on the neck looks like someone dipped their finger in black paint and rubbed it across spots on the back of the neck.The sound effects are lame, basically music from the movie and one with random gun shots. No Arnold quotes at all -Big Disappointment-I would give this a 1 star however the movie is great and has a lot of special features. Just please listen and go with the plain Blu Ray Disc, and save your money. Or at least go down to a Best Buy, and look at it in person, you can see the cheapness for your self."
4,Innovative action movie,"Terminator 2 is my favorite Terminator movie. They are all good, but this one hit all of the right notes and hit them hard.James Cameron should be regarded more highly than he is. This movie is not just an action movie, it also has to do with time and the horror of dehumanization. Cameron did a fantastic job.Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton were never better.I highly recommend"
5,"Amazing Movie, Kind of Questionable Quality","When I say ""kind of questionable"" all I mean is the audio (much like all DVDs) sucks. It's quiet and no it's not my television set. I've tried it on every TV I own and my laptop (with headphones on) and the problem persists to this day.However that's a minor issue and can be easily overlooked when reviewing a masterpiece such as Terminator 2. It's a perfect mix of action and philosophy and to this day absolutely amazes me. One of my all-time favorite films period and in my opinion one of the best ever made as well.Quality of Product: 9/10 (the low audio quality kind of detracts a bit, but it's over-all great)Quality of film: 10/10 (One of the few films I can genuinely call perfect)"
3,Amazon's bandwidth continues to ruin the experience.,"Thankfully this classic is as good as it is. If it wasn't such a great movie, I may have given it one star - on account of amazon's inability to provide the advertised HD quality. This issue with the prime movie service is well documented on the Amazon forums, so hopefully they fix it soon."
5,awesome picture quality with very nice menus/content,"just put the movie in my ps3 and I am very impressed. resolution is great, movie sounds sweet.plenty of extras and it only cost a few bucks!! crazy that it was so cheap!totally worth the price, probably worth 2 - 3 x that much."
5,T2 Endoskull Order,Ordered for a friend in the UK and had delivered for my arrival in USA. Delivered ahead of schedule and excellently packaged. First class service.
3,This movie is Average but the special effects are way cool,This movie is about a woman who has a baby who could save the whole of the human race. A robot from the future called T-1000 wanted to kill the boy.
1,DRM will kill you,"Unless you want to spend all your life make this think work dont buy this non-sens dvd. First you need an internet connection, second you should be in US or Canada (or use proxy servers) third you need too rollback your WM Player 11 to 9 or to 10 (for 10 version you need a patch to make it work); then your IE browser vs7 aparently not work so you need to go back to version 6! and soon an soon.You should be a computer gig, if not forget about it.Every 10 days you should go though all procedure again to renew your licence, accept EULA, if not you dont watch!I regret I spent my money and more important my time on this!"
3,buyer beware,the terminator 2 on blu ray. don't always rely on the reviews of the film alot of these people are comparing the dvd to blu ray this is the standard version of the film look under the picture in the little boxes to see the back cover if you do not see mutiple versions of the film listed then it is the standard version i wish that amazon would only list the comments to the blu ray version of the film and not the dvd version when you are viewing the blu ray version and not the dvd version
3,T2 review,"When I first saw this movie in 1992 in the cinema, I thought this is one of the best ever action/sci-fi films that had ever been made. The whole film is a visual spectacular. The direction by Jim Cameron is almost perfect. I only bought this DVD from amazon because my country's version only contains the special edition. The amazon.com version contains the special edition & the theatrical version of the film on one disc."
4,"It's Arnold, what else can you say?","Hey look, if you are searching for Academy Award material, stop now. If you looking for amazing special effects, violence, and low level science fiction, you are home.Enjoy!"
5,it's a lot better than the prequel but the prequel kicks too,"This is such a great, film i think that everybody should watch it termitator judgement day is one of the best films of it's kind it has kind of a funny but serious attitude to the way the terminator acts but in Terminator 1 it has barely any funny things in it all.THIS IS A MUST SEE FILM SEE AT ALL COSTS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,The Woos anator,"Boy was this movie a stinker a Terminator who understands human feelings and emotion, what's next a Terminator Marry Poppins. This was a sad movie all the greatness of the original destroyed by a gutless machine. Why oh Why did that fool have to make such an un-violent, way too long boring movie, nothing in this compares to the original. The action sequences try to be big but fail, the T1000 looks like a skinny boy (boy was he scary) and the T100 is now fearful killing machine. Give this one a miss, p.s. T3 is even worse."
5,T2,"I love this movie, it completes my collection of the Terminator saga. Can't wait to have a Movie Night, so we can watch all 4 movies together."
1,Dont buy for its high definition thing if u live outside USA,It wont play in other countries Now I am gonna send it back to amazon USA
1,Stay away from BluRay,"Great movie but absolutely terrible transfer just like every other BluRay movie out there. Until BluRay goes with the vasly superior VC-I codec and drops 11 year old MPEG-2 technology, buyer beware."
4,Best Terminator Yet,"I have viewed all four Terminator movies. I consider the first to be a great ""B"" rate movie. The third movie was a bad ""B"" movie and the fourth was more of a poorly made Matrix sequel than a Terminator film. T2 is by far the best Terminator movie and the best movie Arnold has ever been in. The skynet edition Blu Ray includes the extended director's cut which explains more clearly how Arnold's character comes to appreciate the value of human life. It also does a better job of portraying John Connor as a future leader in a scene where he prevents his mother from destroying the terminator sent to protect them. The picture is clear as a day and the sound is great. My only complaint is that the Blu Ray takes forever to load because it connects to the internet every time it is inserted in order to load additional bonus content."
4,Terminator 2 Judgment Day Skynet Edition Blu-ray,Terminator who doesn't know about the movie. I love the sequel of Terminator .. transfer video is average 4/5 audio DTS HD 5.1 5/5 very difficult to access feature 3/5.perhaps if you more patient may be some day there's another edition Ultimater Terminator edition
5,Outstanding,"Terminator 2 is one the greatest movies of all time. The dvd has great picture quality, is action packed, and is exciting from start to finsh. Plus 16 minutes in bonus features not ever shown before. Great price as well. You will not be disapoint by buying this dvd. If you never have seen the movie your about to go on a wild ride of an all time classic."
4,Terminator 2 Blu-ray offer's a difficult to operate Disc menu,Okay if finding this one cheap go for it but if you are like me and likes a easy way of going to the xtras and seperate the extras but beside the curdy menu Pick her up
4,Great Movie!!,"I have read several reviews about this movie not working on some BD players. I can speak from experience that on 3 different brands Panasonic Profile 1.1, Sony BDP-S350 (you need to add memory), and Sony BDP-S550 this movie worked great. Yes on the profile 2.0 it wants to connect to the Internet buy you just hit cancel and it continues to load.Yes it does take about 40 seconds to load but the sound and picture are awesome!!I do feel they could have made the menu easier to navigate. It takes time to cycle through all the scenes if you want to jump to your favorite part. This is a definite buy for your growing BD collection."
3,Blu-ray Review,"I watched this and it took a bit for it to load. The quality could still be better. I'm sure there will be a box set release of all 4 when the new Terminator Salvation comes out on Blu-Ray. Until then I'm waiting. BTW, $14.99 at BB."
2,Blu-ray review (not movie itself),In my mind when you are just slapping dvd auality on to a Blu-ray disk you are false advertising and ripping the public off. No one needs or wants a blu-ray film simply for the disk itself but they want a better movie. Sure they have the uncompressed audio but the picture quality sucks. If you have the DVD keep it and foget this.Great movie poor Blu-ray port
1,Extreme Rip Off,"This extreme version will make you extremely upset you wasted your money. It has DRM embedded! Good luck getting the DVD ROM to play. You have to jump thru hoop after hoop after hoop. It says WM 9 but it's an outright lie. You have to install Interactual player, THEN go their website and hunt for a license and then MAYBE it'll work. And if it does, you get only 5 days and then have to renew again!Other than that, it really is a 5 star dvd of course. But most would want this for the hd version and that deserves 1 star. Better off getting the Blue Ray version if HD is all that important to you."
5,Blu-Ray Does It Again!,"What can you say? This was one of the first movies I wanted on Blu-Ray. And I was not disappointed. It wasn't the first Blu-Ray I bought, but when I saw the deal on Amazon I had to get it."
3,Just okay.,Visuals are decent. Not exactly reference material. I do consider it the best action flick of all time so I think it deserves a better transfer. Maybe VC-1 or AVC instead of MPEG2. The fact that it's an older film has something to do with it also I'm sure. Still good for the price.
5,Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"It is a great movie with awesome special effects. It is by far one of the best movie ever made with one of the best actors ever. Arnold Schwarzenegger brings out not only the role of a Terminator, but of a warm hearted cyborg who will die to protect a human that would in the future, destroy him."
5,An ultimately more human film then the first.,"If the first Terminator was about the past, this one is about the future our future it's an human action movie wich makes Judgement Day so unique is it's ability to entertain you with awsome action , while in the same respect giving you an emotional story.And Terminator 2 has never looked better on DVD it captures the essence that it did 9 years ago it is a classic action movie and always will be it rises among the best the James Camoron has ever done because its not just and action movie it's thought pravoking and the best film Arnold has ever done with crystal clear picture and sound T2 is here for you to capture now and forever."
4,VERY ENTERTAINING,"Although not as good as the original, this blockbuster sequel is very entertaining. Arnold returns as the Terminator, this time sent to protect John Conner from the T-1000 (played by Robert Patrick who gives a very good performace) a liquid metal tech advanced version of a Terminator. The film is full of explosins, action, and special effects, but it lacks the atmospheric suspense and the true fright of the machine the orignal has. Still, a must for any action buff!"
5,Action packed and NOT just for the guys,"Terminator2 not only dazzles with special effects, it plays off the characters established in the first film in an interesting way. The killer cyborg played by Arnold Schwartzenegger is now a protective body guard to a young John Conner. Sara Conner is no longer the quivering victim waiting to be saved, but a tough, hard-driving heroine who takes motherhood light years from the June Cleaver model. Her characterization makes it an accessible film for women as well as men."
2,Original is better,I was a huge fan of the original Terminator. This was a disipiontment. Though it has better FX the plot isn't very good unlike the firsts very unique and original plot. This is a very good DVD and I hope other better movies get this kind DVD treatment. If you want a mindless Special Effects film this is for you.
4,Terminator 2 Blu Ray,A decent disc at a great price. I think it was about $12 + shipping. The video is not a huge improvement over the special edition DVD. It doesn't have a lossless audio track and it is the original theatrical release not the longer special edition DVD.
1,This sucks. If you live outside the united states DO NOT BUY!!!!,I only bought this dvd so I could watch the second disc with the version of the movie in HD (WMVHD) but since I don't live in the US I could not obtain the license to watch the movie cause of the stupid DRM bullcrap they encoded the movie with. After weeks of trying different things I finally got it to work but even now when it tries to play it makes the computer system unstable and the movie only plays one frame before going green.STAY FAR AWAY. Don't buy DRM encoded stuff
1,Perfect example of why DRM sucks,"Could not for the life of me get this piece of junk to play, even after installing the handy DVD playing utility on the disc (handy to the studio maybe, since it phones home with your viewing habits by default). I had Windows Media 11 installed but the disc required version 9 and kept trying to install it. Perfect!Screw Microsoft, and screw James Cameron for letting these idiots put out a crippled version of this terrific movie. Also screw DRM, and Orrin Hatch and all those other Hollywood-fellating congresscritters who unanimously approved the DMCA (since it would be illegal for me to find information on how to crack this nonsense)."
1,Must have Internet connected Blu-Ray player,"Nothing in the description of this video is the critical requirement! If your Blu-Ray player is not connected to the Internet, the movie will not play! Nothing, na-dah."
3,No affect on the feature program? Really?,"I just watched this great DVD. The picture quality is awsome. When I opened the disc, there is a little note from THX program saying that the complicated program might cause some problem, but never on the feature presentation.....I have a question about it. When I played the disc on DTS and Dolby Digital EX, the sound paused at the end of the movie in chapter 77, the scene when Schwarzenegger throw himself into the magma and his function is completely terminated. It was O.K on Dolby surround, but each time I play back on DTS or Dolby Digital, this problem occurs. Am I the only one who has this problem?"
5,Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"This masterpiece is a must for all DVD collections. If you don't have this movie in your house, you are missing out on one of the most explosive sci-fi movies on the planet. This is by far Arnlod Schwarzenegger's best movie ever. With a touchy side to it also, this warm hearted, story of survival is a great movie to have, so get if you don't have it yet!"
2,Doesn't have the slipcase !,"The product doesn't have the slipcase !!! You should specify it, when the first print is replaced with another kind of package."
2,"dvd did not come with metal case,im pissed","recieved my dvd ontime but thuis dvd did not come with metal case,i WANT WHAT I PAYED FOR!!!!! dvd is in good condition but i still want my metal case!!!!!"
5,always enjoyed terminator 2,I had no idea there was a director cut of this film have not watch all of the director cut yet.
4,Great Sequel to a iconic Si-Fi concept story,"Loved it, again. My 14 year old did, as well.Unique storyline, solid special effects & fun scripting- One of Arnold's best."
4,He's back,"As corny as Arnold is, the Terminator films were entertaining. and worth watching just for the campy story line and the great science fiction effects."
5,t2 t2 t2,"need i say more...really impressed with both video and audio quality, best i've seen it look' at home ' since veiwing it at the cinema all those many years ago.blu , unfortunately showed up all of the stunt doubles too clearly for my part,however this still is highly recommended."
5,Fantastic!,"Great classic movie on blu-ray this edition is a lot better than the other Terminator 2 blu-ray out there. The sound quality and picture is perfect. Tv used: Sony KDL-42EX500, Sound System: Denon avr-391 receiver with pioneer speakers and Polk PSW10 subwoofer."
4,"""Metal Case"" Version will ""rip"" plastic case","Love the movie... just a quick note about the version that comes in the METAL CASE. It looks COOL, but once I slid it out of the METAL CASE (which was tough), sliding it back in causes the stiff plastic covering on the ""normal case"" to tear and rip (the sharp metal edges on the metal cover do this. Maybe I got a badly manufactured version. Not a comment on the movie, but just beware of the cool case (i had to get rid of it since it was ""eating up"" the normal case every time I slid it in and out). JUST FYI..."
3,Great sequel,"T2 is an excellent movie. The effects, the acting, etc. The thing i didn't like about T2 was that it didn't have the same suspensful feeling as the first one. I saw the first one as a little kid, and the red eyeball scared the hell outta me, especially because Arnold had half of his face ripped off. T2 was definetly a better movie in terms of special effects. But it didn't have as good of a story line to it. I also didn't like Linda Hamilton's acting in it. She's too tough and mannish."
2,2 stars for the HD version,"I bought this specifically for the HD disc 2 in wmv.What they don't tell you is even though it is in wmv format, you can only play it in the oh so craptacular interactual dvd player software that you must install.wmv and you can't play it in windows media player. Go figure.Classic case of piracy paranoia infringing on the consumer's right to play his purchase using the player of his choice.BOO"
4,Don't be hasty now,"I think Terminator 2 is a great movie. Its one of my favorite. It is easily the best of the three movies and is also a ""must have"" for DVD collectors. It has a good story, great sound and music (esp. in DTS-ES), and special effects still great to watch despite being 11 years old.About the Extreme version though, I am passing this one by. If you can still get it, pick up the older Ultimate Edition instead.If you look hard enough there are 3 versions of the film as opposed to only the 2 in the Extreme version. As far as the windows media support in the Extreme, how good can it be? Who really cares for it if you have Dolby digital, and DTS support anyway.One more thing about T2. I heard another DVD release is slated for the next year (could be just a rumor, I don't know) which is supposed to incorporate both the Ultimate and Extreme content."
3,missing footage,"Can any body tell me if this edition contains the footage where linda hamilton cops a bit of a hiding from the wardens in the mental institution? I have only once seen the full movie on cable, and have yet to find a dvd or vhs that contains that footage. It is important in the context because it explains why linda takes to the medo with the mop handle with such gusto.Ray Duncan"
2,cheated,"Ok, let's get started. In my opinion this DVD has far more negatives for me than the positives. The movie entertained me(still has after a million times) but let's face it, when i bought this i thought this was going to be better than the Ultimate Edition DVD. Hence the name Extreme Ed. Boy was I wrong. This was one of my least favourite DVD purchases. Don't get me wrong, the movie is great and its iconic but the DVD, just isn't up to par with me. I will love the audio commentary though. I love commentary btw. That's one of the reason's I buy DVD's. I didn't even know the Extreme Ed. had commentary..."
4,A BIT STALE,"Some problems: 1. The big-budget, grandiose feel of the movie lacks the raw terror of the first film. The original film was much scarier.2. None of the characters were particularly interesting this time around...even Sarah Connor lacked any interesting qualities.3. The actor portraying the T1000 looked about as threatening as a puppy dog. They should have switched Robert Patrick (T1000) with Arnold. Arnie would have been FAR better as the evil, liquid-metal droid.Some good points: 1. Incredible special effects. 2. Good acting on the part of Hamilton. 3. Widescreen version is far more satisfying. 4. Great story that moves along a bit slower than the first movie, but remains high-quality and a cut above most sci-fi.Great movie! Only minor gripes can be found, and are nothing enough to ruin the movie."
1,t2 hd,if you dont live in the usa and dont have a very fast pc do not buy this dvd microsoft have put a lisence on this disc so you can not watch it out side of the usa not that fair when u have payed four it and find you can not play it
1,Great Movie...Horrible DVD,"Ok I only have one beef with this DVD, but it's a HUGE beef. I initially thought the idea of a metal case was a great idea, but after owning this dvd for a day, the actual dvd case is torn up from this metal cover. If you are going to make a metal cover, at least make it a little bigger than the actual case!!!"
1,Terminator 2 Blu-ray,"Not as good as origional DVD. Suppressed dialogue. Boosted bass. Clipping on effects. Video poor, same as old DVD. One new scene."
5,arnold,arnold. great sci-fi film. the best terminator movie of the entire series. one of arnold's better acting role in his career.
4,One of my all time favorites,"I just watched T2 again for the umpteenth time and I still love it. There was very little wrong with this ground breaking movie. The only reason I gave it a four instead of a five is due to John Connor. As in 1991 when the movie came out, I just couldn't stand his character. When he wasn't crying he was being a petulant puerile teenager. Now, I know that that was the intent, but boy he made me sick. Honestly, that says a lot. For as much as he irked me I still absolutely loved this movie. Even watching it yesterday through the sophisticated eyes of over 20 years of CGI advancement, T2 still holds its own. I remember when this movie was cutting edge and ahead of its time. T2 took movies into a new direction much like Star Wars did 14 years before it. CGI is now an integral and necessary part of movie making and T2 really kicked that off. This is a must see and a must addition to any collection."
3,Region code no good for Aussies,"Paid for it, but it won't let me watch it. The region code is A, Australia and U.K. is B.I hate region coding. If you live in Australia, Europe, or New Zealand better off to illegally download it."
4,Good film.,"I don't quite like this one as much as the original, but it's a good flick and I'm looking forward to 3."
2,WHY IS THIS CALLED EXTREME,personally this dvd sucks it as almost no special features all the real special stuff is on dvd rom I dont have that. the commentary is ok but that doesnt change the subject really this dvd was made just to make a point that they could make the picture look better then ultimate and it only does look better if you have a home theather syestem and a widescreen tv. I DONT HAVE EIGTHER has a matter of fact I DONT HAVE A DVD PLAYER I have a playstation 2. I mean I was so mad when I bouth this I took it right back. now IM trying to get ultimate which is what you shold be trying to get if you looking for extreme to have the same goodness has ultimate forget it. unless you have a home theather syestem dont buy this. and the really bad thing there are no trailer's.
1,Won't play,As others have pointed out this won't play on even a newer Blu Ray player. I have a 6 month old Pioneer with the latest firmware update and it will eventually (try 20 minute load time) play the audio only! The disc is going back to Amazon.
4,No apology sequel!,"Lots, and lots written about this film; so let's keep it simple.A sequel which in itself becomes a landmark movie...A sequel to an apparently unsurpassably good movie...Both films justly belong in the 'Top films of all Time' category.Just buy it, and Terminator, and make your own mind up."
4,Hidden Audio,Play the DVD backwards. The result is Hidden THX Audio. At The end a T1000 voice will give special instruction on viewing the FOURTH Feature version!
5,GREAT SET!!,"I DON'T CARE IF I NEVER WATCH ANY OF THE DVD'S THE SKULL AND BLU-RAY ARE WORTH IT ALONE!! THE EYES LIGHT UP AND IS TRULY CREEPY IF YOU SNEAK UP BEHIND SOMEONE AND PRESS THE BUTTON AND ALL THEY SEE ARE THE RED EYES!! THE VIDEO IS THE BEST PRESENTATION OF T2 EVER, BUT DUE TO ALL THE EDITIONS THAT HAVE EVER BEEN MADE YOU CAN SEE THE MASTER PRINT DEFINITELY HAS A LOT OF DAMAGE THAT WILL MORE THEN LIKELY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO EVER COMPLETELY CLEAN UP. THOUGH IT IS VERY NOTICEABLE HOW MUCH NOISE REDUCTION THERE IS IN COMPARISON TO ANY OTHER VERSION OF THE FILM. THE AUDIO ON THE OTHER HAND IS FANTASTIC, THE 6.1 DTS-HD MASTER AUDIO IS WORTH GETTING THE SKYNET EDITION ALONE, IT TRULY HAS PUT ME IN THE FILM LIKE NO OTHER VERSION EVER HAS!! THE BD-LIVE IS REALLY COOL AND EASTER EGGS FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF THE FILM ARE HERE SO BASICALLY YOU CAN WATCH 3 DIFFERENT CUTS OF THIS MOVIE ON THE T2 SKYNET BLU-RAY."
5,A Cool Movie,"This Awesome Schwartzenegger Movie's Got Cool Features On This DVD including the special edition,trailers, making-of documentaries, and stills. This Is Still The Best SchwartzeneggerMovie Ever Made"
5,My Favorite Movie...,"I am generally critical of most movies I watch - making it a seldom occurrence to find a movie that I truly enjoy. T2 had a good balance of story and special effects with an excellent sound track for mood supplemental. Arnold's natural speech and demeanor makes him the perfect terminator, not to mention Linda Hamilton is now on my list of girls who kick ass (action)."
3,Typical American,I was really excited to see this film in HD format. But because of the licensing for the film you can only watch it in America or Canada. Of course that is not stated anywhere. The normal film is good quality but I wanted to see the HD format. Amazon should state that a product will only work within the USA or Canada.
1,Brazil cannot see this movie,I'm really disapoined to see that a new format supported by Artisan and Microsoft have a downloadble Trailer that can run here in Brazil and the Extreme DVD cannot.. Why that? Do they have plans to make a Brazilian version of this High Definition movie? I think not... They should allow all the world to see the DVD or to create many region DVDs to the other countries...
4,The DVD Is Back!,"T2 is perhaps one of the few Sequels that are as good as the original, full of great action sequences and some pretty good characterisation. The film's not brilliant, but it is a great 2 hrs, (or so), of your time.The DVD is perhaps the most comprehensive edition ever, with one exception that I'm surprised no-one has mentioned; the menu system is terrible. Hidden buttons, no explanations and incorrect instructions just add to the nightmare of navigating this disc. Once you get around this extremely obscure method you can get access to a lot of good material on the making of the disc. It's just a pity that the Commentary is a collection of audio clips from the cast & crew and not just one or two people doing it.Still, it's worth getting and I'm glad I did."
3,Disappointed with Blu-ray Transfer...,"The movie speaks for itself, but as a Blu-ray disc, this purchase disappoints. The hi-def transfer is inferior to most, and no effort was made to create the usual smooth-navigating Blu-ray menus. The disc navigates like a standard DVD, with pauses in between menus and the same minimalist set-up. If you own the DVD, it is not worth $10 (or more) to add this Blu-ray disc to your collection. The DVDs provide similar quality and features, (if not more, considering the only movie version provided on the Blu-ray is the theatrical)."
1,"An ""Apology"" Release? Really??","These guys have a lot of nerve releasing yet another version of T2 in Blu-Ray. The first had no business being in Blu-Ray format with a picture quality squarely on par with any old vanilla DVD you could find in the bargain bin at your local convenience store. Bye-bye $30...Now they've come back to us with another Blu-Ray release that's ostensibly the ""clearest T2's ever been,"" demanding another $20 from each of us for the privilege. Hello? You seriously expect me to pay a total of $50 for what I *should* have gotten for my original $30? Seriously? Where do you people get the stones?Tell you what... I'll wait until this version ends up in the bargain bin before I bend over and squeal like a pig for you again."
3,1st one rocks!,"the terminator returns in this action-packed sequel. But beyone action and special effects there's not much there. A mediocre story that we're given only only to get the audience from one action scene to the next. The movie is entertaining on the basis that you've seen the far superior first film. The film does do what Cameron wanted it to, however. That was to build a new level of special effects in the early 90's. On that level this is a succesful film, but almost seems more like a sequel to The Abyss rather than The Terminator. Just as The Abyss brought cg up a notch, so does this film. An entertaining film no doubt especially if you watch the director's cut version and have seen the first film."
1,Not really good...,The original Terminator was quite good. This one is nothing but a showcase of special effects. Plot is horrible..not recommended
1,Terminator 2-- the most over-rated sequel ever.,"I still fail to comprehend why people say that this is the best Terminator movie, especially now that there are two other Terminator movies that are better. Putting Linda Hamilton's exceptionally poor performance (and I won't even get started on Eddie Furlong), this movie offers nothing but show-off special effects sequences that, by today's date, are no longer impressive. The liquid metal man looks like a windows 95 screen saver. I understand that this film was revolutionary for its time, but it certainly doesn't hold up to the second sequel as far as special effects or story go. Which leads me this: why is the story in T-2 so elementary? And why does the Terminator ""feel?"" I swear, there was once a day when James Cameron wasn't so damned Hollywood. What a terrible move."
1,I don't like this movie,"Alright. When you say the end of the world, did you mean a large portion of it? Because believe it or not, there is still more people fighting the machines. Let's get real here. And didn't that terminator dude ""I'll be back."" Alright, that's nice. It's all good. We'll just send another arnold back to the past to save the little defenseless dude again. WHEN WILL IT END!? Honestly now! Die you terminator. Wait, wait wait. I'll get my wish. In the next one he will die. Just like the last one and the last one before that. It's just a simple repeat, like MIB2. Alright, If you want a good action movie, watch THE ONE! OH YEAH!I know good movies. And I know bad movies. I rest my case."
1,Buyer Beware!!,"Do not buy this Blu Ray if you own a Samsung BD-P1400! Even with the most recent firmware update, the disc will not load! I'm throwing this player in the garbage where it belongs!"
1,peace of junk !!!,"Don?t buy it, if you are outside of USA or Canada. The HDTV won?t play on your Windows machine, even if you have a RC1 patched DVD-Drive.This following message apears in WMP9 during purchasing a license:""The content provider will not provide licenses if you are outside of the countries listed above."" (USA + Can. is ment)There seems to be no chance to get over this, even if you change your windows region and language settings to english (must be a IP-Check or similar).So hands off.a frustrated German buyer!!!! DRM sucks !!!!"
1,Will not work on PS3!!!!,"I was really disappointed to find out that this edition of the film will not work on the ps3. Being that the PS3 is the only blu-ray player I own, this movie was unwatchable for me."
2,So unfortunate,"I thought it important to add my vote to the ""Buyer Beware"" movement cropping up with this BD. If you care about a proper presentation of this modern classic, avoid this (at least) fourth DVD release due primarily to the lackluster transfer. This thing heads up all the BD sales here on Amazon, there's a good reason it's so heavily discounted. You will get what you pay for. A great movie, yes, but certainly not a showpiece for your home entertainment setup. And the bare bones aspect of the release isn't a saving grace.Lions Gate, step up and release a version worthy of the source, for this and T1. Amazon, jumbling up these product reviews is just dirty. Two stars for this release, I'm guaranteeing five for the eventual proper release... which will be a my quadruple-dip on this title. They won. I'll be back."
3,Not much better than the original DVD,"This Blu-Ray disk is unimpressive. The output from my PS3 was similar to that produced by the old DVD that I have of the same movie. There was some improvement in the sound quality, but not significantly. The Blu-Ray disk includes no interesting new features.If you already own Terminator 2 on DVD, I would not bother purchasing this version."
1,BR Zone,"It s a located Blu ray Disc.Amazon.com and this Blu ray don't mention it.I wasted 15$, because, in france, i can't read it"
2,Cheap,"I give this disc 2 stars. The movie is awesome, however this transfer is not. With 8 hours of Extra Features... how much room is left on the disc for the actual movie? Target is blowing this DB out at $5.00. I had it in my had and I had to put it back. I would have bought it if it was a 2 or 3 disk set, but not all on one squashed to fit Blu Ray. Sorry. Save your money and find a better Blue Ray copy than the Sky Net Edition."
1,bla bla bla bla,How can anyone like this piece of crap. I mean come on folks really it's so bad I can't watch it. 2 hours of boring special effects and that god awful arnold as an actor. I rather eat dirt then watch any of his movies ever again. Avoid and buy the Matrix there is a action movie should be like. Not like this piece of crap. Avoid it at all costs. These movies are stupid people who can't tell the diffrent between a chicken and tona.
3,Overdone slow loading bug ridden menu,"This review is strictly for the SkyNet edition. The movie is awesome (and transferred to blu-ray reasonably well), but they have overdone the menu on this particular version so much that it takes forever to load and sometimes even crashes on a fully updated PS3. I could understand a cheap blu-ray player having problems with this, but this is the first blu-ray to actually freeze up the PS3. I'm pretty sure the PS3 is not on it's way out as all other discs I have played recently work fine. Cool idea, but I think the it would have been a better disc if they had kept the menu running a little more efficiently instead of trying to wow us with effects that slow down even a high end player."
5,A nice addition for the Terminator fans!,"First off i'd like to share my unfortunate problem. I bought this and it had to ship all the way to Belgium. My PS3 does not have the region code for the Skynet version of the Blu-ray that comes with this edition. So i was a bit disappointed about that.Nevertheless i was able to view the extreme version and all the extras on the ultimate edition discs.Im glad i have this, ill just have to buy the SkyNet edition of blu-ray again somewhere in my region to see the blu-ray."
2,Terminate this terminator disc.,"I bought this Blu-ray disc expecting great things. I have a new (about 6 months old) Sony BDP-S360 Blu-ray player and I cannot get the disc to play. I even down loaded nine upgrades to the player and it still will not play. I understand wanting the best disc format for this film, but that is no good if it won't play."
3,Don't count on HD working,"I just bought this because of the glowing reviews. Unfortunately, the ONLY reason I got it is for the HD content. And the player locks up on my media PC. I researched the error and it is known and there is no fix for it yet.If you would be happy without the HD this is great. If you are counting on the HD buy at risk. There are still way to many variables for the video to consistenly work. This is mainly because of copy protection and all the funky stuff they try to do to ensure you only use their player etc.Also, another reviewer referred to a code you need to view the HD content. I never saw a place to enter it. My installation went to the internet and got the codec necessary to run it and never asked me for any number to validate anything.This may work in the end but the process is starting out on the wrong foot."
3,I think it was worth it.,"I know everyone is disappointed that the bust is plastic, but for this was an okay deal. It will probably drop in price, but for a fan and collector, I wouldn't take the chance of missing out. I own all these editions, so this doesn't really give much that's new other than a new transfer or remaster of the Blu-Ray. It would have been nice to put some type of new feature on the BD disc.Considering that a Sideshow Collectibles bust is like $500, if you want the display this is nice piece. The teeth are white, which is more accurate than the ones that show metal teeth. The Terminator had to look like a human and the white teeth are a nice detail."
2,"T2 polished image lacks grit, humanity of original","Terminator 2: Judgement Day abandoned what made the original Terminator a landmark sci-fi movie. T2 is bereft of the original's gritty, breakneck terror. Instead, James Cameron decided to go for style over substance. The result: an empty-headed special effects juggernaut with a plot of clay feet. Instead of Arnold coming back from the future as the villian, this time he is the beefed-up robotic protector of humanity's future rebel leader. The T9000 prototype cyborg is an incredible special effect (with its eye-popping shape-shifting abilities) and steals the show. So who cares about Linda Hamilton or Edward Furlong and the human side of the story. Everyone's so hyped for machine vs. machine that we forget about any semblance of a story. Maybe T2's a metaphor for society itself: we've abandoned our humanity (it's good and bad)for the flawless, cold precision of machines."
4,Good quality but it takes a while to load,"Good quality for a remastered movie and very good audio but it takes a while to load the disc as it always try to connect to the Internet to ""activate"" some content (not worthy). That feature cannot be disabled and would it take about three minutes to let you ""cancel"" the connection to Skynet (of course)."
4,Excellent transfer to DVD,"Excellent picture and sound quality of the DVD release of T2 makes you feel like you're back in the theatre!I just wish there were more extras, like a ""making of"" special or some extra commentary by the directory or the actors. END"
1,Surprise!,"I already owned the DVD and I thought if I bought it in Blu-ray Disc it should be fantastic. To my surprise, there is no improvement on picture quality when I play both version on Blu-Ray Player. Extremely disappointed./Pongtorn"
5,The best movie I've ever seen!,"This is the best and the most professionally made movie I have ever seen! As it was released back in 1991 it was far ahead of its time. It remains my favorite one till today! This is just a great movie, gotta get it!!!"
1,F/X Dated Poorly,"After seeing ""Jurassic Park,"" ""Alien Resurrection,"" ""Titanic,"" and ""The X-Files,"" among others, the effects in T2 well...suck. It was impressive 10years ago, but now looks like a high-school media arts project. Personally, I never even enjoyed the movie. Now, it's 100x worse. To top it all off, who's the star? Arnold Schwarzenegger? Need I say more. Don't fall into this trap."
1,"""T2: High Definition"": a stupid design","what a stupid design by microsoft, this version of T2 only available in u.s...why don't they write it in the cover???i was so angry about that.microsoft mp9 is just a joke and once again, STUPID!!!"
5,Pristine,"Watching the Ultimate Edition is like watching this film for the first time. It is super awesome, super clear (in sound and picture quality). A great buy."
1,What happened to the HD Audio?,"An average to poor release with only slightly better than DVD Picture Quality and just a standard definition Dolby Digital soundtrack (probably straight from the earlier DVD releases)... Where is the uncompressed LPCM, Dolby TrueHD, or DTS-HD MA audio track? TheTerminator 2: Judgment Day (Skynet Edition) [Blu-ray] (or it's Steel Tin special edition version) is a much better release with better picture and a true HD soundtrack."
4,The first dvd I bought,"I remember the first dvd I bought was Terminator 2: The Ultimate Edition. I dont think ive ever bought anther dvd as good as that one. The picture and sound are so clear and the bonus features are never going be matched by anther dvd. I do like the movie it has awesome action scenes but it does have its cheesy moments. I highly recommend picking up the Ultimate Edition rather then the ""extreme"" edition."
5,I like this version of T2!,This version of T2 shows many scenes that I did not see in the theatrical version. I love the product!
4,The Best Terminator Film!,"This is one of the coolest Sci-Fi movies of all time. It doesn't live up to The Matrix in my book, but definately holds it's own and stuns the audience with eye candy and good storytelling.The T-1000 is awesome, he is liquid metal, so he can shape shift into other peoples forms. He also slices and impales victims, which can be disturbing.See this film, but be prepared for the high intensity level."
2,Upscaled DVD at Best!!!,"High hopes were set in place for this blu-ray release, and I have to admit I am sadly dissapointed.The transfer is only a 'fraction' above watching a SD DVD version upscaled, which is a real shame.Buy at your own risk, or wait for a much better release, hopefully Director's Cut, remastered and all.2.5/5 for effort.-zallapo"
1,Misleading reviews.,"I do not know why the reviews stating that this is the ultimate edition are listed here. This is simply the short version of the movie slapped onto a blu-ray disk. It does look very good, but, if I had known that none of the extended scenes were on this disk, not to mention that the special features are slim at best, I would have waited for a version that actually had the features that make Blu-Ray worth having."
3,Digital Rights Management (DRM) Issues,"I was about to buy this disk when I did some more research on high-definition DVDs and learned from a report from Sander Sassen of the Netherlands at the Hardware Analysis site that the high definition version of this disk requires (a) the installation of a separate piece of digital rights software, called Interactual Player, (b) an internet connection to the Interactual license server, and (c) an IP address that the license server believes is in the United States or Canada. And then the license you get is good only for four days. It is possible to get around issue (c) by using an anonymous proxy server in the United States, such as the proxy for free site.In addition to the licensing requirements, the HD version requires Windows Media Player Version 9, which is included with Windows XP.The movie, T2, is an absolute must see for any sci-fi fan, but you probably already knew that."
1,Blu-ray version not HD,"!!!WARNING!!!The copy of the movie on this ""Skynet"" blu-ray is NOT in high definition!It looks like what they've put on to this Blu-ray is the lower resolution DVD scan of the movie. It's obviously not the HD version. There's no HD-level detail in the faces, or the costumes, or anything else.The menus are definitely in HD. But don't be fooled, the movie itself is not."
5,Excellent.,"Terminator was one amazing movie back in the 80's. Even though the movie was a low budget one, we see Cameron in his prime, directing at his best wih whatever material he possesses. Very well written and very good effects for the time. But when T2 came out, everybody expected Arnold to reprise his role as the assassin and when things seem to reverse themselves with the first famous ""Get Down!"" of the movie, we know that we are in for amazing ride. The ILM effects team went overboard and it was worth it. Not only did they create a visual smorgasboard of the most amazing special effects of 1991, they also helped to raise the standards of special effects to what they are at present. The movie itself is very satisfying, great action leading to a fantastic showdown in the steel mill. I recommend it to anybody who hasn't already seen it."
4,ClusterDuck Disc Design,"tried two copies, incompatible with 40GB PS3 with all firmware updates. I bought it, return/exchanged it for another copy, still gets stuck loading the main menu????NOT, here's the deal with this stupid disc, once it gets to the main menu it freezes on the world grid map... the skynet map of the continental United States, well YOU HAVE TO WAIT A FEW MINUTES for it to load the main menu data of skynet tracking YOU. There is no loading icon, there is no BD LIVE icon, just frozen on the screen which made me try two copies and return/exchange nonsense. So yes YOU NEED internet connection otherwise this would NEVER PLAY at all unless you wait long enough and it aborts? I haven't tried waiting that long so I can't confirm that. Anyway, STUPID DISC DESIGN regarding interactive features."
5,T2 on blu-ray is AWESOME!,"Admittedly this is one of my favorite movies. To see it on blu-ray makes it even better! The special effects look great, and the entire time watching it I forgot how bad a governor he was."
5,Amazing Blu-Ray,"Being a big fan of the movie, I decided to pick up a copy of the new blu ray edition of T2. All I can say is wow! This is the edition to get it has both versions of the film all one disc. The picture quality and sound quality are outstanding and look amazing for an older film. It does rely heavily on BD-Live so if you have an older blu ray player, you could run into some problems if you don't update your firmware."
2,blu ray edition is not uncut,"I understand now why the blu ray version is so cheap, it is not the uncut version, and after watching that version ten times before getting the blu ray, those extra parts are sorely missed and I feel cheated out of what is missing, and it's much more than the dream sequence. I suppose, as is the norm with hollywood marketing, they release the regular version first on blu ray, then I bet anything down the road we'll see the uncut version on blu ray, so they as usual find a way to cash in twice on many viewers."
4,Get this & get the The Ultimate Edition TERMINATOR,"I got this one (Extreme Edition) & (The Ultimate Edition.) At first I just had the Extreme then got the Ultimate & the reason why I got both is because the Extreme HAS BETTER PICTURE. I was pissed when I got it & saw that it had no booklet or insert, & also no Metal slipcover. (Well that was for a limited time.) also On the Ultimate it had no metal slipcover but it had the 32 page booklet & a insert so I put the insert inside of the extreme DVD. This has BETTER PICTURE THEN THE BLU RAY TERMINATOR 2 DISC (Well I say so). As for what else you get on this DVD is the 2nd. disc is just junk its so you can play it on your PC & it plays it in 1080p HD but you have to do alot to get that up & running so I never will do it, & has 18 mins. or so of never before seen stuff. I say get this cause of the picture & the ultimate cause the ultimate has 2 discs packed with alot of S.E stuff."
5,MUST HAVE for Blu-Ray Collection,This Blu-Ray is great. So many extras that have been added to this classic. The SOUND on this disk is just amazing!! I am a big audio buff and was blown away with how crisp and deep this sounded. If you are buying T2 why not get the good version???
5,"One of the best restorations, for one of the best, if not THE best action movie of all time.","I just rented this movie from Netflix, expecting just another DVD quality transfer to Blu-ray, as most older movies are just that. This movie looks absolutely incredible on this 'Skynet Edition', so much that it's very hard to believe that it's almost 20 years old. This is one of my favorite movies from my childhood (I know, I know, 8 year olds probably shouldn't be watching this one. Luckily I was taught my right's and wrong's, so it didn't phase me and I didn't miss out on seeing this when it was newly released). This is hands down going to be my next Blu-ray purchase. It looks great in 1080p @ 120hz. I've seen this movie hundreds of times and I'll probably watch it a hundred more times when I get this in my collection. GREAT MOVIE at true Blu-ray QUALITY. Worth every penny!"
4,work of art,"The pros on this is that for serious collectors, it's a must have. Although it is plastic, it looks real cool.The cons; Easy to scratch! Sound effects are crappy and I didn't like the fact that the eyes only turn on and off with the sounds. But I re-wired it so the lights stay on with a seperate switch hidden within. I was dissapointed tht there was no ""Collector's Book"". Seems like it would be appropriate for an edition such as this.The dvds themselves have all been released already so nothing new there. But If you are a serious ""movie memmorabilia"" collector like myself, then get this edition. This Endoskull is by far one of the coolest in my dvd sets.4 out of 5 stars only becuse there was no book or film cell or certificate, etc."
3,Stick With The Ultimate Edition if You Have It Or Not,"The T2 Extreme Edition has its benefits on disc one BUT it has virtually no special features except for DVD-ROM, 2 crapy featurettes and the regular version of the film in ROM form on disc 2 but even that is nothing in comparison to the Ultimate Edition DVD BECAUSE the Ultimate Edition HAS TONS OF FEATURES plus the Extreme edition only has the extended version of the film on disc 1 unless you use the easter egg (hidden special option) and the regular version on disc 2 which can only be accessed through your computer as I said earlier so if you do or don't have the Ultimate Edition, get that instead of the ""Extreme Edition"""
1,Will not work on PC Blu Ray Drive,"Just as with many others, I was unable to get this disk to work using my player. My computer IS (obviously) connected to the net, but it still would not play this disk. It detects me as ""Out of Range"" in Canada, and when I hit ""Continue"", it crashes my player software. Avoid at all costs."
1,I got ripped off !!!!,"I paid good money for this and it came broken, The eyes are supposed to light up and it was supposed to play Terminator ""music"" well it does not do anything it came with batteries already installed so the seller knew that it was defective, I will never buy from this ""seller"" again, I would like to get a refund or some money back for this defective item I paid good money for."
2,Poor if not US,"The product will not allow you to view the HD content unless you live in North America. This is short-sighted by the publishers in my opinon as it closes off markets. Let's face it, it's not as if this is a latest release by any stretch of the imagination. If they're really flogging the last from the terminator dead horse after the terrible terminator 3 then you think they would be after all the customers they could get!!!"
5,A must have,"Everybody knows this film, and if you not... Buy it!!!! And this ""extreme"" version, is one of the most amazing things i have ever seen... play it on your dvd and you will enjoy a brilliant film... play it on your computer and you will have a brand new expereience. Absolutely amazing."
1,Wrong region,"The reason for this rating is that I purchased it and it was the wrong region - my fault but, no more purchases.I have watched the movie on another DVD and really enjoyed it."
3,Time Takes Its Toll,"Watching T2 in 2012, you have to remember that this movie was one of the first big blockbuster sci-fi action flicks. Special effects have come a long way, but in its day, T2 had CGI years ahead of its time. So far ahead that this movie leans into that fact and skimps a bit on story. The evolution of Sarah Connor from bungling waitress to pit bull is the interesting core of the story, and the warning to not become what you hate is powerfully delivered.Unfortunately, Arnie's career goals (young John tells the Terminator not to kill anyone) water down the believability of his Terminator character, and the horrid performance by the child star who plays John Connor are painful to behold. Still, there's enough there to make it interesting with the regular length version, with lots of explosions, gunfire and liquid metal morphing. The Director's Cut goes a bit too long, but all completists and sci-fi fans should at least watch this once."
3,T2 great movie!! But the metal case is rough and coarse.,Great movie!! But the metal case is rough and coarse. I waste it into trash can.
1,After a lot of time waiting for it.... It didn't worked !!!,"The WMVHD version (that's the one I was interested at), don't work in my computer, because the license server don't issues licenses for users outside U.S. and Canada (I live in Brazil), so I bought a products that doesn't work for me !!! Why Amazon let me bought that, if it's not going to work for me !?!?!?!"
1,T2: Big Brother Edition,"What, exactly, do load times have to do with whether you are connected to the internet? I have a 1.1 player by design, as I have no intention of ever hooking anything in my HT up to the internet (it is completely closed circuit, and will remain that way). BDLive is reserved for stuff like current trailer downloads, and community screening nonsense. The stuff already on the disc, like commentaries and featurettes should play regardless of any internet connection. This is merely Liongate's way of mining marketing information by tracking what features are viewed so they can sell me more crap. It is also their way of insuring that they maintain control over when and where I watch it (if their server goes down, I'm out of luck). This is the absolute last Lionsagte product I will ever buy until they wake up and realize that they do not maintain ownership of this disc after the purchase."
1,Make sure that your Blu-Ray player can handle the Skynet Edition,"I recently bought the Terminator 2: Skynet Edition (from another retailer) and even though my player was made after this Blu-Ray was released and has all the current updates this is the only Blu-Ray that won't load up.All I get is a black screen even after sitting in the player for over six minutes.So while the movie is terrific, the Blu-Ray disc itself gets a 1 since it won't even load. I'll hold onto it just in case sometime in the future I get another brand of Blu-Ray player that can play this disc.So I would say rent this first to see if your player can handle it or not. Otherwise buyer beware as you just may wind up with a movie that won't play at all."
5,T2 BluRay Skynet Edition,"I must say that I'm very satisty with the product and the service! I received it way before the estimated time, and the quality of the movie were awesome(expected for BluRays)! There are lots of special features, over 8 hours of it... As for the service, I will say that I will continue to order from Amazon.com. The received product is in its perfect form..."
4,Classic Terminator,"Nice DVD to watch, but nothing special. This is just replacing an old VHS but the DVD is much better quality."
1,Waste!,It sucks that I have to constantly plug an ethernet cable into my modem everytime I want watch the flick. Not cool.
3,"Good, But Not Up To The Brilliance Of The First Film","I liked T2, but T1 was better. It had better action scenes, story, future scenes, etc. While the acting in both films is fantastic, I preferred Arnold as the bad guy."
4,Great for Organization,"I was very happy to find this product because living in a house with only 4 walls to every room (no closets) I was strapped for storage. This organizer is great for the little things you need quick access to. Blankets, socks, hats, etc. The only thing I did not like about it was there is only one way to hang it, with the hooks provided. So unless you plan on hanging it in a closet you have to get a little creative. Other then that, I am glad to have bought it."
5,Stunning Product,"I ordered a set of note cards for a friend and loved them so much that I ordered a set for myself. The colors are muted, giving them such a very rich appearance coupled with an impressive quality of paper that it's hard to believe the price is so modest. Even the envelopes are magnificent. I don't impress easily, but this product is more than impressive. It's stunning."
5,I BELIEVE that this CD is the best by far for Cher!!,I love every single one of these songs. They are inspiring to everyone who listens to them. Cher is very talented.
2,Audio Track,Unfortunately only on Desperado there is a spanish audio track. Once upon a time in mexico ist english and french only
4,Whats up with this?,"Why didn't they release this DVD with a Spanish audio track? You can watch this great DVD in French and English but not in Spanish, even though most of the cast is probably Mexican. The movie itself is great. The director is amazing. What an omission. The only reason I switched to DVD's is you can watch them in more than one language."
4,Good,"Johnny Depp was wonderful. The movie, in my opinios was good, but many people did not particularly enjoy it. Personally, I would see it just becuase Johnny Depp did such a great job of portraying his devious character Agent Sands."
5,AMANDA! AN ALL ROUND SINGER,"I love this disc because you get to enjoy Amanda's amazing vocal skills, her amazing sensibility, in a fresh style. Amame una vez mas and Media Hora are my favorites, and they have been for years now. Too bad she hasn't released another album like this one. These songs are sooo powerful and timeless. Having heard all of the new and upcoming singers, I still believe she is truly one of the best of all times."
5,"Very good, works strong, no traces on clothing","I'm using DryIdea for a while now as deodorant, my skin is a bit sensitive so I prefer scent-free ones. And unfortunately everything else leaves very annoying spots in shirts - especially white ones - which are hard to wash out. I don't have that problem anymore since using DryIdea and it works for me well all day too. So I would absolutely recommend it."
3,Where's the beef?,"Well yeah, Robben is an accomplished guitarists. It's just that I APPRECIATE his music more than I enjoy it. This is pretty sterile stuff--flawless and pretty just like Kenny G. Maybe if he had someone else do the vocals (just compare Eric Burdon's vocal with Robben's on ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood""), it all wouldn't feel so lame. Of course, this problem with vocals has plagued a lot of these gunslingers. If you want to hear great blues guitar and don't care about the vocal, pick up some Roy Buchannon and be done with it. Roy always had trouble with vocalists and material selection, but he could send more chills up your spine with one note than Robben can with a whole CD of nice neat, solos."
3,It's alright,"This movie is supposed to be about a guy who likes full figured women, however, the woman he ended up with was not that full. The stand out character was the gay cousin. The first few minutes into the movie has a pointless psuedo sex scene where the main character's current girlfriend is caught cheating on him - in his house - in his bed. He is supposed have help from his womanizing roommate to try to get over that occurance, but that only helps him to get trapped under another man's bed. If you don't have anything else to watch, you probably would be upset with me if I said ""then watch this""."
2,"FILTHY, TRASHY, SEX, MOVIE","I COULD NOT GO PASS 15 MINUTES OF THIS MOVIE,and had to fast forward during those nminutes. TOO DIRTY AND NASTY AND TRASHY. Why would anyone think this was funny or a good movie unless you like nasty trashy, slutty movies.Some people would like to look at a decent romantic comedy, if they can make one.Problem with society now is that everything is based on sex, and the person who always has to show that sex appeal is a woman,...who has now become a 'MEAT MARKET'.Sad. Sorry I wasted my money on this piece of trash."
3,Good software,Nice software for kids. Not sure how much this will help their chess though. More for entertainment than chess improvement.
1,Absolutely Terrible,"This is, without a doubt, by far, the worse software I have ever seen. Perhaps the software had a malfunction, but there was no help key, and no means by which to go from window to another. After 2 hours, we gave up. We had to play a sumo wrestling game, a pac-man type game with a witch, but no chess. This was a chess software program and it was terrible. We never learned one thing about chess. It was ridiculous. My kids much prefer Lego chess to this."
2,Don't Call It Chess If The Characters Aren't Actual Chess Figures,"I have 7 and 9 year old boys that play chess. They are also both very computer savy. I bought this program to buff up their chess playing skills and stategy, but they say they find it boring and don't think it has anything to do with playing chess because the game pieces and boards look nothing like the traditional game pieces. The characters are very difficult to identify and confusing, they are cartoon renditions dressed up in costumes. I'd save your money and look for a better chess program or get your child involved in an actual chess club."
4,Powerful training games,"Although this game maybe aimed for kids, it can still offer powerful training games in an entertaining way. Each assorted machines is like an arcade that trains each tactical aspects individually. Such as blind Chess, eye-training, memory training of chess positions are most notable that separates it from the other beginner chess training programs.The only thing I hate bout this game is the lack of options. You can't log off to a different username without having to shutdown the program first then relog nor can you delete usernames. No BGMs (backgroundmusic)during chess matches.Other than that, its an awesome tactical training tool. Kids really do love to play this game and is one of the best games out there that can get them into playing Chess. I think Chess can be a beneficial contribution to school learning and thinking process."
4,Nice chain for a good price,"24"" 14K gold chain was a gift for my boyfriend. He likes it. The length was perfectly described. The only problem I had was the blue velvet pouch that it came with, it was awkward taking the chain out of the pouch (snagged a little), but other than that, great gold box buy."
4,Interesting story,The story was well told. It pointed out many of the traditions of the church at the time.
4,Great garage album,"This is a garage band on Estrus Records (one of the greatest garage labels). Long defunct, I believe. This particular album (one of three they put out)is so good I've been listening to it regularly for about a fifteen years. ""Disintegration"" has been covered by a lot of bands, but the original is here and it's far better than the other versions. They do a fantastic cover of The Osmond Brothers' famous (and career-ending) psychedelic tune, ""Crazy Horses"". 16 songs, all of them iPod-worthy. Highly recommended. I rate this four stars because I think something has to be Abbey Road-level great to warrant 5, but if I was just using the garage genre as the grading curve it'd be five stars."
5,Kindle Edition,"I love having the kindle version. INCREDIBLY easier to flip pages back and forth to see examples and to check answers. Plus, a huge bonus, it only weighs as much as your kindle or tablet. No heavy textbook. You can bookmark pages and highlight examples that will be on exams. I wish all textbooks came in kindle versions because I LOVE this one. PLUS I didn't have to wait for shipping to receive it. I instantly received it and had to wait a whole 5 minutes for it to download. Great idea and purchase."
1,Not for home study,"I found ""Calculus with Analytic Geometry"" 5th edition by Howard Anton to be useless for home study. I spend a great deal of time referring to other text. ""Advanced Mathematics A Precalculus Course"" by Richard G. Brown and David P.Robbins has been very helpful. I found there is not enough examples or explanations. I found explainations before the examples, not hints with them, more useful."
5,Anton is superb!,"I have used Anton's Calculus texts off and on from the first edition. He is far and away the best writer I've ever used. Particularly helpful is the way topics in a chapter flow one into another.It is always difficult for 3-semester or 4-quarter courses to decide on a sequence of topics. Anton's choices in the fifth edition are different from what I would prefer, but they are acceptable to many programs. Regardless, he is again strong on the many ways he encourages and develops his readers' intuitive understanding of fundamental calculus ideas. My own students have actually come to believe that they can READ a calculus text because of Howard Anton."
5,The Review on The best Calculus book out there,"Let me start by saying that I have tried reading several Calculus books and have found them to be either too vague and/or not analytical enough from a student's point of view. But with Howard Anton's Calculus books, especially if used in conjunction with the Comapnion books, learning calculus becomes very imformative and fun. This book helped me get A's in Calculus 1 and 2. This is indeed, a GREAT book. Unfortunately, I've lost it. Hence, I'm here."
5,Great value for the money,"I ordered this chain for my boyfriend and was skeptical of the qualtiy due to the low price. My fears were unfounded, however. The chain is all the description reads and more. It's a beautiful piece of jewelry."
2,back to the drawing board,"This film was a drastic disappointment. Firstly, the soundtrack is horrendous - a piercing, ferociously screeching mess...if the composer was trying to relay Van Gogh's angst and madness, he suceeded more so in annoyance, when at times the music overshadowed and drowned out the dialogue. The story, although delivering passionate exchanges between the two brothers, flatlines in character development - it is mostly devoid of warmth, failing to draw the viewer in to the soul of the brothers Van Gogh...one is left feeling pity for the pathetic dysfunction, rather than empathy for Van Gogh's passionate longing, joy and despair.... i have said for years that no one has yet portrayed Van Gogh's life properly in film, and i will continue to have this opinion until some talented filmmaker (with brilliant composer in tow) does justice to this enigmatic and misunderstood artist."
4,Unvarnished Van Gough,"An unblinking and unsentimental look at the unique relationship between Vincent Van Gough and his brother Theo, who supported Vincent throughout his life and career. Explores the parallels and similarities between the brothers despite their leading very different sorts of lives. Theo could never sell a single painting of Vincent's during his lifetime, but was convinced of his brother's genius. Displays the working and private lives of both men, and shows the torment of both men as well, without resorting to cliche or going overboard (ala Lust for Life). Both men died tragically and young....within a year of each other. Yet, Vincent's singleminded devotion to his art and Theo's to his brother, insured that the world would have the treasures of his genius. Only complaint, some of the dialogue is muttered in undertone and is hard to catch. But, a minor complaint to a fine film."
3,Only for the young!,"While this book is interesting, the charts included only go back to a birth year of 1969. If you are older than 32 you might as well forget about this book."
2,doesn't stay open,"i bought this umbrella and the dino version for my twin boys. the blue dino version is great, but this frog version won't stay open. i looked underneath the umbrella and noticed that the tent closures are different - maybe the frog version they have in stock is an older model? either way, it caused a huge fight with my children over who would get the 'broken' umbrella because neither of them wanted it. this one's going back to amazon."
1,dodgy PH claims + could biased reviews be due to MLM system!?,I saw this amateur video of testing Nikken's water and PH of water from different sources.What puzzled me was how does adding some water from the nikken bottle to an already acidic water to change its PH is supposed to gives us a more pure water??! It's obvious that a chemical reaction is taking place (otherwise the water PH in the glass wouldn't change). So in fact we're changing the water PH by adding more chemicals to the existing chemicals of a tap water.Also be mindful of the fact that since it's an MLM company there's probably a lot of incentive for its members to give it rave unscientific reviews.
1,If it seems too good to be true it probly is,"I wish I had known that the products from this seller are greatly reduced because they are similar to but not exactly as seen in the photograph. The product can be missing company logos, patented features that are important to it's function. But the company was extremely gracious in offering a refund and explaining the discrepances to me."
2,Weird?! Not worth it!,Overall the system is easy to use once you get it all assembled. I had a hard time believing a lot of the Nikken claims to this. My kids all thought it tasted weird. I periodically had to clean it all out. That was a pain with all the lava rocks. We ended up ditching the system.
4,Lab Results,"I really appreciated all of the posts about filtration systems and feel like I've learned a lot. The Burkey is on my wish list, but currently own a Nikken Aqua Pour. I scored the system at my local goodwill and know a friend that swears by it. It wasn't until I got home and started doing some research on this product that I saw the mixed reviews on it. I learned A LOT about the importance of a lab report and non flouride water. But until I have the money to buy a Burkey Filter, I think the Nikken Aqua Pour is a good start.I did a bit more research and found the following lab results for the Nikken on garymbolton dotcom /pimag/korean_water_test. pdf & here a doc that states what ANSI/NSF Standard 42 and 53 are: same website but after dotcom /pimag/nsf_test. pdfIts data provided by an independent contractor for nikken, but looks ok to me.I find myself sitting in front of the water filter watching it drip. Can't wait for a drink!"
5,Is It Gold Robbery???,"What do a slelleton and gold have in common? You can find out when you read Gary Paulsons bucking smucking western adventure called Tuckets Gold.To find out if Francis will escape from thier wide randge of enemies including ghosts, outlaws, and commacheros.It is less violent than books such as Louis Lamor.Making it better choice for young children that would likewesterns."
3,Tucket's Gold,"One day Francis Tucket was sleeping and he heard something. So, he picked up a bucket and a shovel then went to the cave. When Francis got to the cave he kept walking further and further and he said,''Man this goes on forever and ever.""Soon Francis started shoveling and he heard the same thing he heard before. He started to get a little scared so he ran back out of the cave but he heard the sound again. But he tripped over a small rock and hit another rock. One day later he started shoveling again and found a nugget of gold so he ran home and told his mom and dad and they said,''Wow it's another toy"".Here are some ways I recommend this book to other people. I think you should read this book because I liked it and therefore I would highly recommend this book. I recommend this book because it's a scary book to read."
4,Tech's Review,"I WAS SURPRISED BY THE HUMOR IN THIS BOOK ABOUT THE OREGON TRAIL. MOST OTHER BOOKS ON THIS TOPIC ARE VERY SERIOUS. I COULD NOT HELP BUT READ THE REST OF THE SERIES. THE FRANCIS TUCKET SERIES IS ABOUT FRANCIS TUCKET WHO IS KIDNAPPED BY PAWNEE INDIANS, AND RESCUED BY A ONE-ARMED MOUNTAIN MAN CALLED GRIMES. HE GOES ABOUT A WILD ADVENTURE WITH COMANCHEROS, MURDEROUS SOLDIERS, THIEVES, AND A BLOOD-THIRSTY PAWNEE NAMED BRAID. ON THE WAY HE MEETS UP WITH FRIENDS AND FINDS THE LONG LOST TREASURE OF A SPANISH CONQUISTADOR. THIS BOOK IS THE BEST BOOK ABOUT THE OREGON TRAIL THAT I HAVE READ. I GIVE IT TWO THUMBS UP AND A LITTLE MORE!"
5,Tuckets Gold,Tuckets GoldI think an adventure type of person would like this book because they explore the dessert and it has lots of action. It also lets you get a feeling of how they had to live back in the Texas dessert and they had to find everything they had to eat.I would rate this book a 5 star award because you feel like your Tucket and you had to take care of the kids and yourself from Chamancheros and bandits. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate it a 10.The stories about a kid named Francis Tucket that was captured by camancheros and his friend helps him get away. He also has two kids that he has to take care of. He has very good luck and finds gold and silver by a stream. Also he gets bit by a rattlesnake and blacks out nd when he wakes up he is laying in a bed in a Indian village and they take care of him.
2,Disappointing book,"I'm sorry to report that I was disappointed in this book. I think the conversational format interfered with my ability to truly engage in the substance of the topics. Plus, there were too many instances of the authors congratulating each other on the contributions of their own work or of the work at their respective institutions. Again, this interrupted the flow of the substance. Instead of an in depth discussion, I was left feeling that the topics were covered only superficially. I did gain additional insight into Buddhist thought, but I think I could have gotten this more effectively with a different reading choice. I would not recommend this book."
4,Good Book,"Recieved my book on time. Found that the book was in good condition and really have no regrets on purchasing it. Especially after finding out what a new one would cost. I would like however, to mention that it does need updating. It'll still do the job, but would really enjoy an updated version of the same book."
3,Indiana jones and the temple of doom,"I have everything Williams has recorded on c.d.Temple of doom is in my top 5 williams score.Unfortunatly,the c.d. suffers from poor sound quality,and contains about 40% of the movie's score.Wait for an expanded release which is on every Williams wish list..."
4,The Best Of The Indiana Jones Trilogy Can Now Be Found!,"Ah, how does one describe the feeling of finally completing his collection of John Williams' music? Well, absolutly wonderful! This John Williams' soundtrack is one of the hardest to find. Considering it's by John Williams I'm not sure why, but now that you've found it, buy it! Be one of the few people in this country to own this musical adventure. Impress your friends!"
5,One of John Williams best ever scores !,"I was surprised looking at this entry that this disc seems to be an expensive import. Then I looked at my own copy which I have had for some years and realised it was a Japanese import too. Why it hasn't been released as a mass market disc is beyond me as it is one of my favourite scores. Standouts are the amazing Chinese ""Anything Goes"", the splendidly percussive ""Slave children's Crusade"", ""Short Round's theme"" but above all ""Nocturnal Activities"". The latter is a five minute fifty second tone poem in itself. Erich Korngold meets Rimsky Korsakov meets Richard Strauss complete with wonderful pizzicato. Its worth the price of the cd on its own !"
5,John Williams's Masterpiece,"This is not only the best score in the Indiana Jones trilogy, but one of John Williams's most fun and booming work yet! I just wish it contained more of the film's score."
4,This CD is hard to come by and worth investing in.,"Ever since I became a collector of John Williams music, I had been looking for the Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom soundtrack. For some reason this soundtrack is hard to come by. I was elated to come across it recently and purchased it without hesitation. This score has always been my favorite of the Indiana Jones trilogy and I'm a bit dissapointed that the soundtrack didn't include more music from the film. It's rather short, but still good. The only hope of hearing more music is if the soundtrack is reissued, but I wouldn't hold my breath. This may be the only place to get a copy and it's well worth it."
3,Where is the REAL score?,"One of the best ""Finale and End Credits"" scores is Temple of Doom. Using the main ""Raiders"" theme, John Williams integrates secondary themes of the movie masterfully. They are woven into the familiar trumpet melody. The only time in the trilogy he did this. I bought this CD for the closing track. However, it is NOT the original music. If you have the DVD, compare the end of the movie (starting from the return to the village)to the CD and the best parts are cut out. When will a true soundtrack for this movie be released?"
3,Indiana jones and the temple of doom,"I have everything Williams has recorded on c.d.Temple of doom is in my top 5 Williams score.Unfortunatly,the c.d. suffers from poor sound quality,and contains about 40% of the movie's score.Wait for an expanded release which is on every Williams'fan wish list...or buy this release in case it does not get expanded,it still belongs in every Williams's fan collection and offers some good tracks.But dont blame me if you are disapointed after listening to both the c.d. and the movie after..."
4,ROT Rocks,"This movie is definitely one of the best movies if you're into the underground gore, with a bit of humor, too. It has some great special effects for being on such a low budget. I think it's great."
5,nutrtion to help prevent urinary tract infections in your cat,"I use this, along with the antioxidant blend from Resources, ""Cranberry Comfort"", cosequin, and methigel to help keep my cat's urinary tract healthy. Additionally, high quality cat food (such as Pet Guard or Natural Balance) along with raw ground meats, has improved his condition. He used to get urinary tract infections frequently, and his current diet has changed this thoroughly."
3,Skate and Destroy,"So far so good. The game hasn't grabbed me completely, but it should be fun for awhile."
1,I love the series but can't recommend this game,"I have 3 previous Tony Hawk games that I adore, but American Wasteland has so many bugs and glitches that should have been worked out in development. Instead, the game seems like it was rushed into production at the expense of the Tony Hawk reputation. If you love the series, as I do, rent this game before you waste your money on it. You'll see what I'm talking about. Some of the glitches will prevent you from advancing any further in the game! Who needs to pay so much money for that kind of frustration?"
2,"been there, done that",Very very dissapointing game! no load times?? SURE so skating through a glitchy plain corridor for a minute is not considerd a load screen?? or how about take the bus? ANOTHER LOAD SCREEN! why arnt the games just on skating? not killing hippies with dinosaurs? worst of the series
2,Bad game...Just go get skate :p,"I didnt like it..Here's why---Graphics 2/10 --not good at all,Generic..Nothing more I can really say about it.Gameplay 0/10--I felt very weird about the whole thing,Felt very Generic,Clunky.Sound 10/10--best thing about the game,the best soundtrack out of any game I have ever played.Bottom line 3/10--The soundtrack saves it from getting a 1..Just move on from this and be glade they don't make these anymore."
5,Sk8bOaRdInG RuLeS,OK so heres the thing Im actually a good looking 14 year old (ladies) mexican dude who wrote a kids review because I didnt feel like typing my email address.This is the best Tony Hawk game without counting THUG 1.It has great new tricks like the bert slide and all the flips.Career mode is all right but if you do buy it and you are looking forward to your american wasteland park at the end of the story mode dont its simply horrible.Keep sk8boarding and bmxing.
1,Huge Regression,"I've played since THPS2, and although I don't think anyone buys Tony Hawk games these days looking for shocking originality/innovative gameplay, this game will likely be the last of the genre that I purchase.It feels shoddily done and quickly produced to make a buck from loyal fans...I consider this a scam. No more customization of characters in story mode? Glaringly worse, no more ability to be a girl in story mode? (yes, there are female fans out there..I know I'm not the norm, but throw me a bone...I don't get the point of removing it from a game) First 20+ missions forcing a character to ""learn skills?"" Poorly animated gray screen is subistitution for much hyped ""no load screen""?Come on, Neversoft...moves like this insult and alienate your fan base."
2,Just Like the Undergrounds,"Based on the name and when you see this game in commercials, it looks like an awesome, revolutionary, perfect 10 type of game. But, it turns out it's just another pathetic version of the THUG games. Everything is the same, except the levels (which are small and stupid) and the dumb bmx bike (which has very bad handling). Not to mention the missions that you do are very easy, short and boring. The only thing you do is skate around, look for somebody and they tell you to do a 1500 point combo over something. I'm not exaggerating, that's really all you do! Look for people, do a trick or two, and that's it. I beat the game in 2 1/2 hours. So if your expecting some outrageously fun, spectacular skateboading game, don't look here. I don't recommend this game to anybody, honestly. I was seriously disappointed, and I guarantee that you will be too if you buy this game."
3,"An OK game, but way too many defects","I'm glad on renting this game for money's sake. It isn't worth past 35 bucks. This game is fun, but with way too many things messed up. These things include the diffculty, in which they expect you to pull off a 10,000 point combo as the 2nd or 3rd mission. This is especially difficult to those who are new to this. Also this is a big downgrade from THUG and THUG2 in graphics, and story. The Create a Modes are figgin' sweet, more if you have an EyeToy to put your self in the game. So unless your a hard-core Tony Hawk fan, rent it first."
4,Ghetto Skater,"This game is mad c0ol. The levels are insane, really realistic, and big. There are awesome tricks u can do. You can even tag stuff. Every skater has his own tag. You can ride both- a bike and a board. Get this game- best Tony Hawk game so farr."
1,cheval mirror,"What a horror this has been! I received my FIRST mirror, and the brass piece was snapped in half on the bottom. The company said to disassemble it and repack it and UPS would pick it up and they would then send a new one. And so yes another week later mirror number TWO arrived, and the glass was cracked on that one. Now the company said they'd send number THREE. Me being the ever so patient person said, ""These things can happen, third time is a charm""! Well, number three came yet another week, or so later, and this one the wood dowels are so warped that the won't keep the mirror base together. Now if I had all THREE mirrors, perhaps I could put them all together and get one decent mirror. I will NEVER deal with this company again !!!!! Disgusted on Long Island"
1,Don't expect a response (or mirror) from FurnitureBuzz.,"I placed my order with Amazon (FurnitureBuzz is the actual seller) for this item on December 10th expecting it to arrive as advertised before Christmas. It is now January 3rd and I just today received a cancellation notice from Amazon! I tried contacting FurnitureBuzz directly on December 31st, but they never returned my email.Amazon still lists the item as 'Usually ships in 6 to 10 days' but you will probably be lucky to hear anything from FurnitureBuzz. I am sure it is a nice mirror, but I would look to buy from a more reliable seller."
4,Attention Span,"Wendy Ip's second CD has excellent moments. She rocks out with her band throughout the disc with a voice that purrs & coaxes. From Winnipeg, Canada, Ip's autobiographical ""Just Wendy 2003"" is a stunning track with her piano pumping furiously as she makes a parallel between her name and the mythical Wendy from ""Peter Pan,"" ""The only thing she knows for sure is she doesn't want to grow up 'til much later."" She duets with Chris Buckle on a delightful track ""In A Perfect World"" that beats like a rock-march into the future, ""In a perfect world, I would be your girl."" ""When He Plays"" has a tongue-in-cheek quality with David Andreana's tasty electric lead & Wendy rocking joyfully despite the obvious, ""He doesn't have too much of an attention span, He doesn't have much money, he does what he can."" Other tracks like ""Valley & Peaks"" & ""Up to Me"" are also excellent. This is a charming & strong sophomore effort from the talented independent singer. Enjoy!"
3,"Product works, beat up but works",The product works fine but the packaging it came in didn't hold up to shipping. When I got the Chiller the casing was all bent up and doesn't look good at all. I only kept it cause I was mounting it in a cabinet.
5,love it!,i was no able to find these in store so i bought them online. i love them. better to replace the valves than the whole cup!
3,They sorta do the job...,"Spill proof, sure, but they do not last very long. The cups are great and last so it is nice that the replacement valves are not that expensive."
3,He did It AGAIN!,R.L.Stine Did it again! ThIS BOOK was really good!!!! Just like the others that he wrote! This book is so good I finished it in one day. I kept on turning the pages... couldn't stop reading! You would NEVER firgure out wat or who the ________ was! I mean It was really a shocking ending... like thats a surprise! Lolz! Neways you should really read the book! I think you might like it! I mean the book was great! Even my friends like it! Enjoy Reading!
5,R.L Stine Has Did It Again! A Great Book To Read!,"Fear Street Saga: The New Fear was absoutley great! I mean at the beginning it was great, especially about when Nora was trying to save her baby. And when Nicolas is trying to make his fortune to when Rosalyn, and he meets Ruth, and her evil doings.Read this book. It is great"
4,Great Book,"I felt bad for Nicholas throughout this book. It seemed like he just couldn't catch a break with anything he tried to do. If I'm remembering correctly, this is the only book in the Fear Street Sagas that RL Stine actually wrote himself. Everything else was ghost written. I think I would've liked the series more if he had written them himself. This is definitely a good read."
1,"NO DON""T BUY IT","This food is horrible for hamsters and gerbils. It is WAY to fatty! My gerbil started to eat it and I saw almost right away that he was getting fat. Gerbils and hamsters may love it but it's really bad for them. It has to many sunflower seeds, dried corn, and dried fruit. If you want your hamster or gerbil to be healthy don't buy it. It's a waist of money."
2,Re-Record?????? Paging Miss Emily!!!!,"Despite all the rave reviews I'm wondering if this is a dreaded rerecord. Maybe I'm paranoid, but the country music industry is so sleazy. And some stars feel entitled to cash in. How else can you explain the John Anderson Anthology...Horror. (John, how could you?) Or the Bill Anderson Oh Boy Classic [Oh boy here comes a rerecord). Hey, the CD sounds great. But what makes me suspiscious is that there are no copyright dates anywhere on this CD except for one. Also the cryptic message on the inside sleeve. Could someone please clear this up. And not some RCR Bud Logan shill either. John Conlee is one of my hero's and this is really worrying me. I can't look at this CD with Rose Colered Glasses anymore."
5,-,Ordered this CD for my mom who had been looking for any of this artists CD's in stores.She was very happy with the songs on this CD.Shipping was excellent!
5,One of the best.,One of the best RPG books for the West End version of Star Wars. Covers all the important facets of the Dark Empire comics. And gives you a glimpse of Luke and all the others when they become really powerful in the future. New ships to fly and places for gamers to go. A good read even if not a gamer.
3,Typical Christian Movie Quality,"I hate to 'trash' a movie that is trying to bring a good message about Christianity, but this movie suffers in several ways. First, the photography is somewhat strange, with an eerie light cast over the whole movie. Second, the acting is just that, acting; few, if any, of the characters have done enough acting to really be able to get 'into' their role . . . to make it lifelike. Finally, I think the plot, or editing, is somewhat confusing so in the end they resort to a long sermon. The film does try to bring a Christian message, but it is like most 'Christian' movies in that the message is more important than the story, so the story seems contrived to get the message across. I'd say that this movie is best left to showings in church youth groups where it serves as a springboard for discussion in the group.[For an outstanding movie with a Christian message that does not in any way seem contrived, see the Disney movie 'Ruby Bridges.']"
4,Surprise it's good,"I pick it up because Eva Pigford was on the cover, but I purchase it because Tech Holmes was in the movie, a high school classmate. Tech and Eva and especially Regina Bell gave a great performance. It had a good message and it was very funny. I know I'm going to buy another one for a Christmas gift."
3,URBAN CHRISTIAN MOVIE,"THE WALK IS A CONTEMPORY URBAN FEATURE FILM CHRONICLING A TURBULENT TIME IN THE LIFE OF SYDNEY, A FRUSTRATED YOUNG WOMAN STRIGGLING WITH NUMEROUS TUMULTUOUS RELATIONSHIPS. STARRING: EVE PIGFORD, TECH HOLMES AND REGINA BELL"
2,Not well put together,"This film is about a girl who gets into the wrong crowd after her father's death.I found it was disjointed though. Tek's character was interesting while Eva's was not developped. The film had some kind of haze in many of the scenes (useless as far as i am concerned). Sometimes shes dreaming, other's she's not and you can't tell one from the other. The acting didn't seem to come natural. The film could have included more scenes which would have showed how hard it was for Eva's character. In the end she just comes around and her Christian mother couldn't be happier.There are better inspirational films to choose from."
1,Save your money.,"Sometimes low-budget movies are fantastic, THIS ISNT ONE OF THOSE MOVIES! She is still young and has plenty of time to find a BETTER vehicle to promote her career."
3,no map,"Beware -- this Smithsonian reprint does not contain a copy of Hornaday's famous map, even although it is referred to in the text."
2,not what I thought it was,I thought this book was going to have stories that people could easily remember and tell at a campfire. Wrong! A few of the stories were short and okay but I can't imagine kids sitting and listening to the short stories let alone the long ones. I found this book boring and not at all what I thought it would be. Sorry.
4,"Clean, Dry, and to the Point","This book is not bloated with theory...which is exactly why I like it. Yes I've been coding HTML for over 4 years, but it doesn't hurt that this book has a healthy (X)HTML section that I can turn to to remind myself of things that may have been forgotten. This book is a good technical reference manual that requires you to build your own examples. If you want beautiful color pictures of examples to accompany the mechanics of XHTML and CSS, I suggest you partner this book with any of Eric Meyer's publications. If I have one critism of the book, it's that it treats tableless lay out in a cursory fashion, but having a book by Meyer's should compensate for that. Final analysis: excellent learning source for beginners and a very good quick reference for pros."
2,"Eh, could have done better.","This book teaches alot of outdated and deprecated methods of web design using HTML and CSS. It also does not explain anything more than simple text and picture modification. If you're looking for something to teach you more powerful usages of HTML and CSS, I recommend looking elsewhere."
4,Good for a brush-up,"I hadn't worked in CSS in several years and my skills were beyond rusty. The book doesn't give you any particularly advanced skills, but if you're looking for a refresher, you could do worse.I would imagine it would work well for most people new to this as well, but it's hard sometimes to know how much previous knowledge you're bringing with you."
3,"Helped me out, but could have gone further","This booked helped me with a lot of my codes that I have been trying to find, but after that it seemed to be a dead end. It doesn't describe things as well as it could, but it's still understandable. There are some points, though, that I became completely lost in what I was supposed to do to alter the code to my liking, which makes it severely frustrating at times. I am currently looking through other books (mostly CSS, which I agree that this book needs more of) to better fit my needs, but I'll definitely keep this on hand because it seems to be a great reference for times that you need a code that you can't find anywhere else. ^-^"
2,COME BACK JOANNA CAMBELL!!!,"Where are all the original people? Sorry but I do not like Christina, she seems annoying. Is this the end of my favorite series? And what happened to racing? We need a GOOD writer to save this series tha t i love!!!!"
1,I give up on Thoroughbreds!,"Okay, I defended them for a while, after #s 24 & 25 came out, hopeing they would get better, but they haven't. I just thought I'd say that I am no longer reading or buying thses books. Ad far as books go, they never were that fantastic, compared to classics like Les Miserables, Oliver Twist, etc, but they were fun and easy reads. Plue they were about horse racing, which practically no fictions books use for a sucject. Now these books have gone completely down the tubes. don't even bother to read them. Save your money!"
1,What happened here?,"What happened to this series? What happened to Sammy, Ashleigh and countless friends? I don't get why the racing thing just ended. I mean in # 23 Ashleigh tells Cindy shes pregant again and then the books just swich to Christina and her selfish little friends. In Ashleigh's Christmas Miracle, Christina was in love with Kevin. Now she's big with Dylan. Out of the whole series, I haven't read six of them. There's at least 5 authors. Jonna Campbell, Karen Bently, Alison Estes, Alice Leonhardt,and Dale Gasque. And what the heck is Sammy doing in IRELAND?"
2,This series is starting to ---,I can't believe what is happening to my favorite series of books. I am too old to read them now really but I still do anyway. I started reading them a long time ago but now to-- . What happened to Pride and Wonder and Ashleigh and Sammy and Tor and Max and Cindy and everyone else? The series was a lot better with the first generation of people. And with horse racing instead of jumping. END
2,Not the greatest,"This series is dragging. It used to be like two books in the series would equal a whole summer. Now it's been like what#24,25,26,27,28,29 and the summer isn't even over yet!!! I wish these books would speed up (But not skip 10 years)."
1,AHHHHHHHH!,"The Thoroughbred series is drowning. Unless someone can save it from Alison Estes, no one will buy the books.Then, it runs out of money and goes out of print. OH NO! I haven't read Christina's Courage, but if it's anything like the other books by Alison Estes, it must be bad. What happened to Sammy, Tor, Cindy, Wonder, Fleet Goddess, Glory, Jazz Goddess, Champion, Mike, Max, or any of the old characters? I am dying to know. I must know! I've already read all of the other books by Joanna Campbell that were made in to ""Asheigh's favorite books!"" They were all really good, top quality books like the ones I expect from Ms. Campbell. If only she'd realize that her series is going down. Please come back!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,where is joanna????,"I'm sorry to say it but the new books are just BAD! The new writer need to read what she's writing! the books are about HORSE RACING! not dressage & jumping!!! PLEASE!!! if we wanted to read about that, we would read books about jumping or dressage we want to hear about horse racing!! Where is Ashley, and Sammy,and Cindy, Max, and Wonder, and Fleet Street, Champion?? did they just all fade away??!! Hellooooo? PLEASE JOANNA COME BACK!!"
4,Christina's Courage: An excellent book!,"""Christina's Courage"" is a well written book about a girl who dares to dream. This masterpiece describes the fears and daring events of a young girl who is dealing with a green horse. I highly recommend this book to avid horse-lovers"
3,Cristinas Courage,"In Christinas Courage, Christina Reese and her grey thoroughbred mare, Sterling Dream is finaly getting ready to compete with Christina in 3 Day Eventing. But Christinas instructor, Mona wants to get Sterling to actaully behave and jump the liver pool. Sterling has always been afraid of water and that makes more of the challenge. Sterling just wont behave and starts to distrust Christina after Christina forces Sterling to jump the liver pool. Christina feels she has lost trust in her mare and ecaspically after Mona made Christina hit Sterling with a crop to make Sterling jump the liverpool. Mona starts to think Sterling will never make a good event horse. But Christina and her cousin from New York knows Sterling can make the best event horse around. But how can they get Sterling to behave and jump water or even step in it? Did Christina trade one of Ashleighs Wonders foals for nothing? Find out if Christina and Sterling forgive eachother and be one to compete. (...)"
4,cool! one of the best. why such a low rating?,"This is one of the best THOROUGHBRED books, though most of them are ""one of the best""! Anyone who does or admires showjumping should read and own this book. It is awesome! Sterling isn't behaving, and Christina is fustrated. It will take a lot of work to make Sterling a good jumper again. There are lots of surprises in here."
1,Ain't read it yet,Well I think that Allison Estes got Christina and Mellisa mixed up. Because Mellisa can be okay. But then Christina is a total brat. Just look at your Ashleigh's Christmas Miracle Christina and compare both of them.
3,I am an eventer...,"But I can see that the series is going to the dogs! Where is Sammy? When did she go to Ireland? Cindy, where's Cindy? Did she marry Max? I think #30 should be a stable reunion. Where IS glory? Fleet Street? Mr. Wonderful? Champion? Why is Shining at Whitebrook away from Sammy? HONOR? My favorite Honor Bright...where?"
1,Stinks,"I literally see no difference between the plot of this book and that of the last. It is the same except this one is dressage. There is yet ANOTHER author! Yuck! Stinky! I can't believe what this series has turned into! Joanna Campbell, Karen Bentley, come back! What happened to Cindy? Really, this book si the same as #26. I bet #28 is the same as #27 and #26 excpet they are at camp. Honestly!"
3,We need Joanna Campbell back,I agree with everyone else. Where are the old characters and horses. Go back to Joanna Campbell.
3,What happened to this series?,"Ever since this new autho rtook over, things keep getting left out of the story. Glory suddenly stopped racing and we knew nothing of it. It was mentioned briefly in passing. The babies were born all of the sudden. No big deal, right? Things jump around and people disappear! Joanna Campbell needs to start writing again or the current author should read the older books and find out why we, the readers are so upset!"
1,useless product,"I bought this product after being caught up with the features it offered, got the product and loved it. I used all it features as soon as i got it. However one week after recieving this product it went unfunctional. My computer would not recoginse it and when i tried to power it on it will come on and freeze on the busy screen. Tried it over and over and it never worked again. ended up buying a Sony nw-s205f mp3 playerafter reading reviews over the net on this product. Seems like this product is not very good because there have been widespread problems with it. I recommend customers not to buy this product."
4,Easy to install,I bought these for my husband's birthday. I was so surprised that they were that easy to install. The only problem was the headrest. Didn't fit very well. They look very nice and will be easy to clean.
1,Too Bad...,"I ordered this album as a gift for my wife, who is a huge Bob Dylan fan. The first copy was extremely warped and didn't play properly. The replacement copy was slightly warped and only played on one side. I am not happy with the quality of this vendor's products, but I appreciate that Amazon ensured that they refunded my money."
3,"No 4th Street, Bummer","My dad says the problem with this record when it came out, back in the day, was that it didn't have ""Positively 4th Street"" on it. The collectors, though, all had to have it because of the different cover. The above editorial says this version has three songs not included on the American version, ""She Belongs to Me"" and ""It's All Over Now Baby Blue"" from ""Bringing it All Back Home,"" and ""Sooner or Later"" from ""Blonde on Blonde."" So what? ""4th St."" is still not on it and since any serious Dylan fan already owns ""Bringing it All Back Home,"" and ""Blonde on Blonde,"" there is no reason to buy this CD. Still the material is outstanding, so I'm giving it three stars anyway."
5,BOB DYLENS Greatest Hits,"The original rapper,he never could sing-just a cross between rap and a chant-but he put together words,thoughts,emotions,and music that is still current-I'd almost forgotten some of his songs,untill I saw them listed,and heard a sound bite-Bought a used copy-good price,quick delivery-HAPPY customer!!!"
5,"So far, no bad disks.","It usually never fails - I buy a pack of 50 DVDs and maybe 1 in 8 to 10 doesn't write properly and goes into the trash. So far I've used 25 of these without a single bad disk. Unless I hit a bad spot with a bunch of bad ones, I expect I'll get through these with few to no bad DVDs. If so I will certainly be buying these next time."
1,Very bad quality - look elsewhere,"I've been burning DVDs for some time and these are by far the worst quality blank DVD+R media I've used. I mainly use either Sony 8X or HP 16X DVD+R media with very good success rates (99% successful burns). I bought these Maxells because (a) they were on sale and (b) good brand name. I was disappointed to say the least. Thinking I just bought a bad batch, I decided to get another pack but got the same results. I've tried several burners (and several PCs) with the exact same results (1-3% success rate). Given my experience, I'd recommend staying away from this brand for DVD+R burning."
1,Unreliable,"I've recorded over 1300 DVD's, most of them on TDK disks( top grade), However I tried other brands and all were acceptable except for Maxell DVD-R's, they really suck. Never know which one will record and finalize, its a crap shoot each time I record on Maxell,very unreliable product, missed many recordings. Funny thing is some of them will record the program but won't finalize. Crazy ?TDK, excellent recording disk."
1,50 Pack Of Frisbees! Worthless JUNK!!,"First of all, I did not purchase these from Amazon so this in no way reflects on Amazon. I would just like to let anyone interested know that these DVD-R discs are worthless junk. When I first began burning my own movies to DVD I used Verbatim and experienced a 10-13% failure rate with about 600 units, which I considered somewhat acceptable I suppose. I began using HP DVD-R discs when the others were suddenly out of stock and to my surprise I have gone through 1200 discs with not a single failure. I picked up a 50 pack of these Maxell discs when the HP were out of stock and experienced 49 failures. My new supply of HP discs arrived and I have not had any failures since.So, if you enjoy throwing your hard earned money into the weekly trash go ahead and purchase these discs. The decision is yours."
1,60% Failure Rate,"I usually buy a different brand of DVD-R discs. I won't name the other brand, but I had probably less than a 1% failure rate with them. My store was out of them, so I bought a spindle of these so-called Digital Versatile Discs. I needed to burn 2 copies of 2 different DVDs I'd authored. I now have the 4 burned DVDs and 6 other DVDs that failed to burn. That's 10 tries to get 4 to burn properly! That's a 60% failure rate.Why did I keep burning discs when they kept failing? Because I have a client on his way over to pick them up. When failure is not an option you keep burning the discs until you get four to work. Luckily I am a long standing customer with my supplier, and I should get a full refund.I SHALL NOT purchase any Maxell products again."
4,"Great Product, Horrible Shipping!","We burn a lot of DVD's and have been using these Maxell DVD-R's for a while because they play on all of our DVD players without an issue and seem to skip far less often. They are great quality.However, the condition that these arrived in was ridiculous. The case was literally cracked and breaking apart. It really wouldn't be difficult to throw a bubble wrap AROUND the whole case instead of NEXT to it in a box and prevent this. So far, the DVD's seem to be unaffected, but I won't be surprised if some were damaged."
4,always reliable,"For whatever reason, I have found Maxell's to be the most reliable blank CDs and DVDs. I use these for backing up computer files and for burning old VHS home movies to DVD."
1,You might as well flush your money down the toilet,"You might as well flush your money down the toilet than waste it on this pack of DVD-R discs from Maxell; at least there is a possibility of enjoying the aesthetics of money ride down the plumbing. These discs are supposed to work for data or video but the data often fails to load properly and the video never works. This is so incredibly disappointing as Maxell has a good reputation and I have found the previously products from this company to be of high quality, but this is simply a set of worthless and poorly made crap. Perhaps they might work as coasters, but whatever your needs are, this product cannot meet them."
1,Dissapointed,"Well I didn't order this from amazon got from the BX on base. Labels on product and disks say i can store 4.7gigs of information but when i got to burn info on it, it only has 4.38gb of free space and the file that i require burnt is 4.5gb so i was a little disappointed"
4,Candid and well written,"This book will have most of its appeal to those with interest in medicine, missionary work, or anthropology. It consists of Schweitzer's medical case histories, travels, hospital administrative chores, reflections on African and European culture, and general overview of his first decade and a half in Gabon on the west coast of Africa. Schweitzer's candid comments about the Africans and the harsh conditions under which he worked help make this book better than the average account of third world philanthropic endeavors. Schweitzer shows true insight and compassion for those he came to help and I found the book highly engaging."
1,deeply offensive for us natives of Gabon,"I read this book out of curiosity because my grandmother remembers Dr. Schweitzer very well. I found this book very offensive because of the imperialistic language of ""superior Europeans coming to the rescue of inferior childlike Blacks"". He calls us ""children of nature"" and ""savages."" Read the book, it's all in there."
2,what's all the hype,"I bought this cd after reading the glowing review it got on Stereophile, after listening to it for 2-3 days, I had to return it. Mr Wallace don't have a lot ideas to play, he has a certain phrase that he keeps playing over and over again in a song, on every song. 2 stars is for the rhythm section."
4,Perte de contrle de soi dans un environnement hostile,"C'est un ouvrage très riche en apports sur le plan psychologie des personnages, au-delà de l'intért du sujet-mme, je le recommande à tous rien que pour cette dimension."
2,Too technical,"After just finishing Herbert's Santaroga Barrier and jumping straight into this one, I had high expectations, especially after reading others' reviews. Throughout the book I found there was FAR too much time given to detail - latches, levers, knobs, control panels, etc... Unless you're someone who's served aboard a nuclear sub, it's impossible to paint a mental picture of what was going on half the time in this book. And the ending was.. well, not much of a bang. I was expecting a big 'twist' - something I'd never expect, which never happened. On the plus side, it did have some interesting philosophical views which Herbert is good at. The characters were somewhat enjoyable, and there was some good suspense at times. But overall I found that too much emphasis was given to the workings of the submarine, and the climax was a bit bland.I would suggest watching the movie ""Das Boot"" over reading this book."
3,Chorus Album,"Too much chorus and not enough metal.Also too cheesy, I was surprised there was no song called enchilada.Although ""Today is a Good Day to Die"" is one of my Manowar's personal favorites, I only enjoyed a few songs in this album like 06-Loki God of Fire and 14-Odin. On the other hand, tracks like the beginning of 05-Slepipenir remind me of ""Score Metal"" from Rhapsody of Fire... which is what made me stop listening to them. Also, 09-Blood of Odin which talks about blah blah blah, 8 legged horse, blah blah blah, 18 power charms including a charm for love making!!!!!! I don't see how that's metal and not enchilada."
2,Enough already...,"I've always liked Manowar, but I'm with the first reviewer. The songs about metal, fire, steel, etc are fine but lets branch out a little. Eric Adams has the most amazing voice and the last few albums don't do it justice. I'm sure I'll be dismissed as not being a true fan, but I've followed them since the early 80s. Personally, I'm now at the point that I turn them down in my car because their lyrics are so childish that I feel I should have a license plate with ""DungeonMaster"" on it. They can still sing their fantasy songs, but lets mix in a few songs with substance. Even one called ""drunk as hell"" would be a welcome change."
4,"A great album, if you don't have Sons of Odin already","To be honest, I was a little disappointed with this album, but mostly because the great songs were already included in the Sons of Odin EP, the additional material isn't good enough. Nevertheless is a very coherent and epic album, if you enjoy a Manowar album full of interludes and symphonic sections, and you don't have Sons of Odin already, this is going to be great for you. Otherwise, I recommend the new EP Thunder in the Sky, a much more classic Manowar heavy metal."
3,Gods Of War??,"Warriors of the WorldTheir last album 'Warriors Of The World' was MUCH better. Production wise and sonically this album was very good, but it had no rythmic 'catches' or 'hooks' to make you want to listen to it again. The story-line of this concept album is like the book of Revelation from a Satanic point of view. I think Joey DeMaio really beleives he is a warrior for Wodin (commonly spelled Odin). I think he has lost his mind.'METALMAN"
1,Very Boring Release,"Avoid at all cost, this album is not worth any amount of money, and if was given to you as a gift then it wasn't given by a friend! Very boring, only three real rocking tracks on this release with the rest being musical interludes and narration and a bunch of useless crap. If you are any kind of a fan of Manowar you will be extremely disappointed after hearing this."
2,Not Even Close,"Okay, they're cheesy, over the top, Spinal Tappy and all around silly. But they have some good songs and can play it an inimitable sloppy, fast, over the edge sort of way. The lyrics are worthy of Ed Wood but ya know, there's something appealing about them. There's an honesty. And when they're on, they rock pretty damn hard. The problem with MOW is that they have no definitive album. There's a few songs on this album and some good moments on that album but it never all came together for them. I think that's what they were trying to do here. What a disaster. Again, some good moments, but not nearly enough to sustain interest. Every other song is bogged down with some lame pitch deepend narration. The ""orchestration"" is really just samples. My guess is that even the choirs are sampled this time out. MOW fell in love with technology and lost their way. They still remain pompous and silly however."
5,My favorite album by Manowar!,"I love this album! It is amazing music and quite different from other Manowar work so if you do not enjoy fantasy narrative music mixed with rock you probably won't enjoy this change. Since I love this kind of fantasy soundtrack music and after finding out to my chagrin that the wonderful soundtrack to Conan is no longer in print, this fills the void. If I was making a fantasy movie, this music would be a nice soundtrack! Must listen to be believed. If you want a musical odyssey in fantasy and magic, this album rocks!"
4,The Triumph Of Steel MK11,"This Is the best offering since The Triumph Of Steel Which was released In 1992, My Favourite Tracks Are Kings Of Kings, Sleipnir,Loki God Of Fire, Blood Brothers,Sons Of Odin & Die For Metal. Only Manowar can deliver a truly metal masterpiece Which Blends Elements Of Classical Music And True Metal. Eric Adams Voice Is the Best In Metal And The riffs And Bass Lines Are Awesome.This Is a must For True Metal fans or anyone that is into the NWBHM scene in the 80s, Any fans that are into grunge Please give it a miss"
1,What a waste of money!!!,"I bought this album because it had 16 tracks and I thought well 16 tracks of songs will be enough for a new fan of manowar but no there was mostly nothing on here but a whole bunch of worthless interludes skits And less of their decent metal except for die for metal which I didn't like.I did not spend a good $15 dollars just for their silly mideval interludes and narrations I just wanted more decent metal from these guys"" I tell you this cd is a little good but mostly junk.What's the point of releasing an album like this?!Don't waste your money on this it's not worth it."
3,"Exciter's ""Dark""est moment...","Ottawa's Exciter appeared to be all but finished around 1997, when ""The Dark Command"" came out. When another Ottawan, Alanis Morrissette, had usurped a huge fan base of ex-Exciter fans after many metalheads abandonned the thrash quartet due to its reluctance to conform to new musical trends, it was evident that the end was nigh. ""The Dark Command"" does sound a bit like a band going through the motions in some songs such as ""Burn At The Stake"", but other songs such as the adrenaline-pounding ""Aggressor"" and ""Assassins In Rage"" reflect a band still overcoming whatever obstacles fall in their path. ""The Dark Command"" has flaws, but the band may be able to put all of that behind them now that the classic Exciter line-up has returned, and fortune and fame may once again embrace them. Then it will be Alanis' turn to scream bloody murder..."
2,No comments....,"EXCITER was not great even at their prime, back in the eighties. Try to return now with a weak album was not a smart movement..."
3,Good in Some Contexts,"I read this book for an ADR master's degree course in late 2012. It is full of interesting anecdotes about the author's intercultural experiences. The advice offered in this book seems well-suited to resolving religious/interfaith disputes and other conflicts where worldview is really at the heart of the problem. However, it is very relativistic and might be difficult to mesh with a lot of more evidence and logic based ADR practices like those offered by Fisher and Ury. As such, this information would probably be pretty awkward for use in domestic business or legal settings."
2,"More of a cookbook, less about zen",I was looking for more then just recipes as content. It's ok for what I paid for it (1 buck from the zshops)
2,I think this movie was intended to be clever - but is very Bizzare,"The King of comedy: A story of a man portrayed by Robert Di Nero obsessed about making as a comic on a late night TV show. He lives in a world of delusion - and constantly ignores social cues and even being removed by security from the property - only to return again. A pathetic character actually. In this story - he has spent much of his adult life creating a comedy set - yet never goes out to even one club to work on it, Very unrealistic - I am a stand-up comic - and I know it can take years to develop a set and refine it. Sandra what's her name is in this too - and there is NO follow up as to what happened to her character. I won't spoil it for you - I will say this film starts off twisted - and only twists some more. The ending didn't do much for me. I can't say I 'hate' this movie - but I can tell you I don't like it.Scott MacNeil"
5,A truly fascinating & very watchable film,"""The King of Comedy"" is not only a very unique film, but also very entertaining. And if you love the medium of film, then it's one you need to add to your list of ""must-sees."" While overall it's a pleasure to watch, there's a very creepy, unsettling undercurrent running throughout as Rupert imagines his life as a celebrity; really engrossing & simultaneously off-putting material. I saw a review in which the writer mentioned that ""The King of Comedy"" is a sort of companion to ""Taxi Driver"" and I have to agree as both films explore an uneasy underbelly of American culture. ""The King of Comedy"" is the best (and most watchable) work I've seen in dealing with narcissism and our celebrity-obsessed culture. It's a shame the film was not popular upon release as the writing is stunning & piquant and the actors are uniformly excellent."
5,"""KING OF COMEDY""","By far, De Niro's most underrated movie. A brilliant, biting satire on the public's almost pathological obsession with celebrity. The story holds true today, perhaps even more so than when originally produced. Whoever cast this movie did a great job: Jerry Lewis' performance was a stunning surprise; Sarah Bernhardt couldn't have fit more perfectly into the scene, and De Niro was at his best. Especially appreciated by New Yorkers, this film would still attract the keen viewer of dark comedy anywhere."
5,One of Scorsese's best,"This is one of the most underrated films of the 80s and easily one of the best, also. In a decade in which Scorsese made more ostentatious films (Raging Bull and The Last Temptation of Christ), as well as more commercially viable projects (The Color of Money), it is easy to see how his most low-key and perhaps most challenging picture went ignored upon release. It's now finally getting its due. I know many people who prefer The King of Comedy to Taxi Driver, and while I don't think it's quite that brilliant, it is a perfect compliment to that masterpiece. Worth seeing solely for the performances of DeNiro (who deserved another Oscar for his work here as Rupert Pupkin), Lewis, and Bernhard. Highly recommended."
3,Robert DeNiro has never been seen like this before,"Robert DeNiro is usually a mean, foul mouthed mobster. But in this movie he stars as a more Woody Allen type, it really shows DeNiro's acting skill, which we usually overlook because he usually plays a mobster in every movie. Anyway, Robert DeNiro stars as a man who is obsessed with late night TV host, played by Jerry Lewis. DeNiro, by chance, gets to have a little chit chat. Lewis, just wanting him to get away, promises him a spot on his show and blah, blah, blah. DeNiro, ecstatic with joy, thinks he's for real. When DeNiro finds out he wasn't for real, he takes action...and...it's...slightly humorous. Funny at some points, but all in all a nice flick. Directed by Martin Scorcese, and Sandra Bernhard also stars in the film, very annoyingly though."
3,Great Film...Poor transfer,"This is a great film, as many before me have stated. However, this transfer to DVD is inexcusably poor. Nice way to treat your fans. What a disappointment."
5,Some of you don't get it.,"And ""you"" would be David Hutton, a reviewer a few posts down. Dark comedies aren't normally billed as laughfests. They are meant to be funny, yes, but the storyline usually has a little bit of an unnerving edge to it as well. FYI, I wasn't laughing during this movie either but still found it immensely entertaining. Scorsese is one of my favorite directors and I love the job he did on this film. And De Niro and Lewis were perfect fits for their roles.If you want to have a few belly laughs, Mr. Hutton, I suggest you rent a few Laurel and Hardy shorts. You completely missed the boat on this one."
3,Not suitable for Europe,"I regret that I bought this dvd because this dvd from THE USA can't be played in Europe, wrong region.It's not for sale in Europe. i world like to watch this classic movie of Martin Scorsese with actor Robert de Niro."
2,Dangermouse--the final 4 seasons,"I watched DM on Nickelodeon growing up, but I had forgotten that they ""new and improved"" it in the final seasons. The format is longer, the witty, dry narrator is all but gone, and DM and Penfold spend WAY too much time yakking. If you want the true essence of DM, stick with the earlier seasons. But, if you're a die-hard fan, or if you have small children, it's a must-have I suppose."
4,Crumbs! What a DVD!,"On the talk show scale of Jonny Carson being the best, Chevy Chase being the worst, I give it a Conan O'Brian. Becuase you'll never know what goning to happen next."
5,Amazon Item - Easy on the Hands,"I have owned dogs for the last 40 years and know that grooming tool comfort takes on greater importance as the years go on. This brush fits comfortably in your hands and makes grooming easier...that works for everyone, including the dog. Would recommend this brush to anyone."
2,Consider this before buying,"Hello, the intent of my review to going to be different. I know there are already various reviews that describe this book. The major thing I think everyone should consider before reading this book is the content level. If you are going to purchase this book make sure to keep this in mind: The reading level of this book is very simplistic. I would suggest if you are in between grades 4-8 then this book is right for you. However, if you or the person you are purchasing this for are profecient in reading then i would only suggest this book to kids below 6th grade. Lastly, in a very blunt way i am going to state that many girls would enjoy this book. The main theme is the love between a mother and daughter. Something I think a girl could relate to. Although, I myself am a male and I was still able to enjoy this book. Thank you!"
3,Book Review by chelsea,"Esperanza Rising, by Pan Munzon, is about a girl that migrates from Mexico to California. The story takes place during the Great Deperesion, in the rosy plains of Mexico and the working fields of California. The main charactor, Esperanaz, is a girl that thought as she got older nothing would change.If Esperanaz's life turned out how she thought it would be, this book would be a fairytale. But when tragedy strikes she must leave her home and move to California. The reader will enjoy this book because of the vivid words the aurthor uses. If you think your life could be a fairytale, just till you see what's coming your way."
5,Esperanza Rising,This book is about a girl who lives in Mexico and something bad hapens to her and she has to move to the United States secretly. I think pretty much all ages would like this book. I loved this book because there is always something happening in every chapter. WARNING! It's very hard to put this book down!
3,"Good, eductational, historical read.","My son was required to read this for a book report. He wasn't happy with the assignment, but once he got over the initial sadness, he ended up finishing and enjoying it. And he learned a lot, too!"
5,I loved this book!,I had to read this book for one of my classes and it was amazing! I read it all in one night! The book also got to me a lot faster than I expected it to which was awesome!
5,Esperanza Rises Above and Beyond!,"I loved this book. I sat down and read it in one sitting because I could not wait to find out what happens to Esperanza! It is a book that goes beyond a great cultural kid's book. It shows the spirit and determination of people that came to the USA for a better life, and in many cases, like our main character actually ends up in worse situations. But, as many of those immigrants did she rises above the deplorable circumstances and makes a life for herself. A feel good book for all ages."
2,Camille T's Review,"Esperanza Rising Book Review:By Camille T. Nueva 7thEsperanza Rising was a book about a girl in Mexico and California duringthe Great Depression. The main character starts out in Mexico and after a series of unfortunate events is forced to travel to California with her mother. While in California she and hr mother fallow the jobs all through out the state avoiding U.S. customs agents and trying to live a better life. Personally I didn't like the book because I did not like the main characters personality and the plot of the story, I think, is like that of a lot of other historical-fiction books on this subject. But I think that it would be good for a younger reading audience."
3,ok. sometimes exciting sometimes not,"When I read this book it got somewhat exciting in the middle and the end but the beginning was sort of borring. other people may think differently, I have heard many great reveiws for this book."
3,Esperanza Rising,"This was a very good book because it's about a girl named Esperanza, and she faces many problems through a couple of years. First her house burns down so her and her parents have to move. One day, her dad was standing outside and strikers came by and shot him. So, now they were in even bigger trouble. They had to move to California to get away from the strikers. When they got there , they moved into a small cabin. To find out what happens next I think you should read it, I think you'll like it!"
4,Esperanza Rising,"""No!"" That was Esperanza screaming to her uncle so that he won't marry her mom. Wow, the characters from this story pass really hard moments. For example, losing your dad, and migrating from Mexico to the United States, that has to be difficult, well it is. They move into bad situations; however, they find a way to get over it and make a better life.I really adore when the author adds descriptive parts in the story, because when you're reading you can really imagine the story taking action in your imagination, and that's the time of person I am. Esperanza Rising is a magnificent story that clearly releases Esperanza's feelings. It talks allot about their daily lives. What so ever, it can get boring in some parts while they are travailing to the United States.I love this book, so maybe you might enjoy it too. The only way to find out is to go to your near by public library or buy it at any book store."
5,"""Those who live with hope are the ones who survive.""","This poignant picture of the daily life of Mexican migrant farm workers living in a California work camp was inspired by the life of the author's grandmother. It's painted so carefully that young readers experience the seemingly insurmountable situations and hardships as Esperanza lives them. The unconquerable love of family members for one another enables them to endure until things get better.As Esperanza's life unfolds so does the issue of what is fair treatment for migrants. It's an uplifting survival story simply, but beautifully, depicted as though the reader is watching on a giant screen. Teachers who use this book as a classroom study will have an open door to discussing the difficulties families faced because of the Great Depression."
4,Esperanza Rising,"I would give this book a 4 star. What happens is Esperanza is 13 and something happens to make her leave Mexico. Can she survive and make it to the U.S? You have to find out! Boys and girls, moms and dads would love this book."
4,ESPERANZA RISING,THIS BOOK IS CALLED ESPERANZA RISING.THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK IS PAM MUNOZ RYAN.ESPERANZA IS GIRL SHE IS THIRTEEN YEARS OLD.ESPERANZA WAS BORN IN AGUASCALIENTES MEXICO.ESPERANZA LIVES IN EL RANCHO DE LAS ROSAS IN A BIG RANCH.ESPERANZA IS SPOLIED LITTLE GIRL WHATEVER SHE WANTS SHE GETS.ESPERANZA MOMS NAME IS RAMONA FORTANLY SHE HAS HER DAD TO.

4,Why did everyone in my Bookfest group hate this?,"I read this for Bookfest last year, and everyone else in the group hated it! I thought it was really good, though. It shows what it was like to go from riches to rags an be treated unfairly. Esperanza is kind but kind of confused because she doesn't know how to work. This is very good and I think anyone could like it if they tried. Because for alot of books, when someone looks at it, they think they're going to hate it. So then they try to hate it, and they end up disliking it. Please do not do that to this book. It's very well written with a good story."
5,Esperanza Rising is great.,"One of the class novels for our 6th grade class is Esperanza Rising. After looking at the book and seeing all the Spanish words, I decided that I needed the tape. The kids loved it and it was a great success in the classroom."
4,SWEET STORY! N.T.,"This is a great story about Esperanza, a young Mexican girl who had it all. She had the best clothes a girl desired, she went to the best private schools, and had a staff of servants at her beck and call. Tragedy strikes. Her life is turned upside down when her papa dies, and her home is set on fire by her devious uncles. Esperanza, her mama, and three servants flee to the land of freedom, the United States of America.In the states, they struggle financialy. Making matters worse, mama gets Valley Fever. Mama's condition takes a deeper plunge when she goes into a depression.This was a great book! It covers different emotional stages in Esperanza's life. She faced with luxury, sadness, confusion, anger, hatred, love, and hope. The story was fun, and entertaining. With every page I read, it had me anticipating the next. She had a non-stop determination to regain her happiness. You'll have to read it yourself to see if she actually found it, and where her story ends."
4,"Good, but sad story","I bought this book for my daughter - required summer reading. My daughter enjoyed the novel, although it took a few chapters to get into the story. It was a sad story about a young girl's life."
4,Review,"Esperenza rising is a great novel based on a wealthy Mexican girl who is spoiled and family is well off. As things change around when her father dies and her, her mother and grandmother move to America from Mexico to start a new life and start over. This book is a great book to show some one to enjoy what thy have while they have.This book will show you how when things are good and your family has money your life can change and you have to do things the hard way and your poor and can't accept it."
5,A LifeTaking Review,The book Esperanza Rising by Pam Munoz Ryan is about Esperanza a young girl that lives in Mexico. Her family goes through hard times and is forced to move to the United States because of her uncle Luis who is after her mother ever since her father was killed.I liked this book because it's the story of how Esperanza traveled through the country. She had to learn to live her new life as a peasant. I like that about her.I think Pam Munoz Ryan wrote this book to tell the reader about the way someone lived a long time ago.
4,Esperanza Rising,"Esperanza Rising sends a spring of color into the readers life and mind that could change someone forever. Esperanza's hard work and effort to help her family come together again Shows off her strong will and kind personality that could bring out the best in anybody. Esperanza's life was broken in many ways but with new friends and maybe a bit of luck, her shattered world seems to start coming together for her."
3,Which book? Esperenza Rising? It's ok...,"Let me start by saying that reading is not my favorite thing to do. I read books maybe one a month. When I chose one, I usually pick one where it sounds interesting. The summary the reviews, and so on are all good. Esperenza had that, but was it a good book? Not really no. It was ok, but Esperenza was nice to begin with! It says a snobby girl turns sweet when her father dies. She didnt change! Nothing happened to her! There was no point. It was all in all a ok book, but I do NOT reccomend it. ."
5,Esperanza Rising,"Ryan has given us an accurate, engaging page-turner. Readers will enjoy the story while learning about the lives of farm workers. This story is re-told in real life even now in the lives of thousands of farm workers around our nation. While the strike referred to in the book failed, readers can log in United Farm Workers or Cesar Chavez for books about a successful series of farm worker strikes. Gracias, Senora Ryan!"
4,Esperanza Rising,I loved this book! It felt like I was there. It's told like a realistic fairy tale. You can read it over and over. It's a girl's favorite action book!
3,Be ready for the tough times in life BLS,"This book is about a girl that's 12 years old and how her life changes before her eyes. Esperanza has had some tough times in her life and they all happened to begin at the same time. These are the difficulties so far.Esperanzas papa was a good man until a couple of men killed him and took his families silver. After papa died, a fire began and the family had to evacuate their home and go in a wagon. After being in a wagon, they were off to California to live in a Mexican camp where Esperanza had to do the work. Esperanza wasn't too fond of working but she had to. Her job is to take care of the babies and sweep the platform. I recommend this book for people who like emotional and exciting books"
5,Very good book ! Good message to youth.,"This was simply a good read for youth or perhaps for anyone. The story sent out a message concerning discrimination, learning and coping with change, and growing and evolving into a stronger human being. Thumbs up !"
4,a great book!,this is a great book . its about a girl in mexico who loses her dad. at first she was rich but her uncle burned down her house and told her mother to mary him so they whould have a house.they decided to go to califonia and escape there uncle. but it was hard for her to be poor after being so rich. as I said at the top this is a great book.
3,Esprenza Rising,"Esprenza RisingI want to tell you about Esprenza Rising this story is all about a girl how is use to getting what she wants. After a series of tragic events she must rise to the challenge of being a worker. I think you should read the because you can learn a little Spanish also if Mexicans this is the book for you. I like it because Esprenza had a happy life, but I didn't like the sad parts, and that's why you should read the book."
5,A fabulous Book!!,I like it because she is sad at times and happy at times and I like books like that!!... She likes Miguel and I think that is cute!... i feel really bad though because she came from being really rich from really poor and also when she went to work she didn't know how to do anything! all though she later learns!
4,Esparanza Rising is a Good Book!...,"The book Esparanza Rising, by Pam Munoz Ryan, is really well written. It has a good plot and is exciting so you don't want to stop reading it. I especially like that all the Chapter Names are foods/fruits in Spanish. I think that was a good idea. My favorite part of the book was when Abulita came, and Esparanza and her mother were so happy. I think the author should make a sequel. I know I would like it!"
4,A good Book,Esperanza rising is a good book becuse it teaches us to be thankful for what we have. And not get caught up in our own ways....
3,Esperanza Rising,Esperanza rising is a great book I would recommend to 5th or 6th grade children. It follows the story of Esperanza who is forced from her ranch in Aquacalientes Mexico after her father dies and her house burns down. Due to her Uncle's greed Esperanza and her mother are forced to flee Mexico. They have almost no trace of their once privileged lifestyle and are forced to accept help from there former workers. Esperanza and her mother travel to California to work on a farm. They go through numerous hardships before they are reconnected with Esperanza's grandmother. This book is a great way to introduce discussion about racial prejudices as well as stereotypes. This is also a good book to help teach lessons of perseverance.
3,Esperanza Rising review done by katie perry,"Esperanza Rising is about a 13 year - old girl who lives on a ranch in Mexico with her family, consisting of her mother, father, and herself. On her 14th birhtday however, that will all change. Her father dies the night before, and soon after his two, rich and powerful brothers come and visit the family. One of them, Tio Luis, perposes to ,mama and she refuses. Not long after their house catches fire. Now they are forced to live in the servants shed. Abuelita was injured though in the fire, so when Esperanza and her mother move to California, the decide to send money later for her to come over. Esperanza's mother becomes sick with Valley Fever and then pneumonia, so she is forced to fight for heself and live with her mothers friends. She works packing bags of food/produce to earn money for Abuelita to come over. does she make enough money for Abuelita, and do her uncles find out what she's doing. To find out read the book!"
4,Story With an Arc,"I enjoyed reading this story because of its characters, the plot, and the Mexican and Mexican-American culture within it. The structure is like that of a classic 19th century tale: a character in a high place falls, then, through his/her own effort, rises. Usually the rise is centered on economic circumstances, but in this book it isn't -- the rise concerns self-knowledge, making this a strong and enjoyable book. I also enjoyed the fact that a year or more went by in the course of this book: a refreshing change from middle-grade and young-adult fiction in which the time period is usually compressed into a day, a week, or, sometimes, a school year. Well worth reading!"
4,"An historical fiction novel about self-knowledge, determination, and hope","Thirteen-year-old Esperanza has everything--a beautiful home on El Rancho de Las Rosas, doting servants, and a loving family. But when bandits kill her father, Esperanza and her mother must leave that world behind and flee to the United States during the height of the Great Depression. Between struggling to work as a field hand, avoiding trouble with striking migrant workers, treating servants as equals, and being treated as a scorned minority for the first time in her life, Esperanza isn't sure she'll be able to rise from the ashes of her old life to accept the opportunities America has to offer.Esperanza Rising is a very real story about a carefree girl whose eyes are opened to the world around her under the most difficult of circumstances. Learning to see the value in others, she also learns to see the value in herself."
1,Cliched and overrated,"This book may have won an award, but that does not stop it from being bad. This book is brimming with cliches, and The plot is the biggest one of all. Let me summarize this book for you. Girl is rich and spoiled. Tragedy strikes. Girl becomes poor and is forced to work. Girl realizes all she ever needed to be happy was her family, not material wealth. The End. That sums up the book. Esperanza is an entirely unlikable and unrealistic character. It is truly amazing how she goes from "" I hate working"" to ""I have to work for the good of my family"" in about 10 pages."
1,boring...,"We had to read this book in school, and i thought it was going to be a cool book. Wrong! I almost could have fallen asleep. You could pretty much tell what was going to happen on the following page. Horribly boring."
1,arizonamom2boys,"This book is filled w/anti-American sentiments and several untruths. I personally found it offensive and one-sided.Here are a few examples of untruths:page171, ""Immigration officials send them back to Mexico. ....those who are citizens and have never been to Mexico.""page 187, ""you have a better education than most people's children in this country (USA). In fact, Mexico is ranked much lower than the US in education.page 187, ""Americans see us and one big brown group who are only good for manual labor."" We have many doctors, teachers, lawyers, politicians who are of Mexican descent."
1,"Yuck, yuck, yuck","...This book doesn't have any humor, that's for sure. It is as dry as a drought. (That means really dry, .... It's plot is also pretty much as exciting as a five hour lecture on how much TV children should be able to watch. (That means it's duller than dull...The plot is corny, dumb, and childish. I really couldn't like this book less if I tried.You would think this book is too bad to get published. Turns out it's not."
5,Pam Munoz Ryan's best!!!!,"This book is one of the best I have ever read. It is about a girl-Esperanza (the Spanish word for hope)- who is forced to move off her prosperous ranch to work in the fields. It is an inspirational story about strong girls. After I finished reading it, I just sat there thinking about how hard it must have been for Esperanza-I won't give away any of the plot-to survive. I would recomend this book to anyone 8 and above. I don't want to make it seem as though it is a quick read, or not for any one over 11-I have even told my mom that she has to read it!This is one of the best books I have read!!"
5,Esperanza Rising,"Esperanza RisingHave you ever read a book that it made you actually transport into the characters life, that is what will happen to you once you read Esperanza Rising by Pam Munoz Ryan.Some of the things I liked about Esperanza Rising is that it gives so many great details, details about the way they describe how they feel they even describe how the food in their mouth tastes. Personally at first when I began to read the book I thought it was a little boring because there was not that much excitement it was only Esperanza and her father speaking to each other. But then many exciting things started happening well of course I can't tell you anything because you have to read the book. But, trust me you will NOT be disappointed when you begin reading this great book."
5,Esperanza life.,"Esperanza is a girl who had everything in her life.But from one day to the other day she almost lost everything in one day befor her birthday.First her dad died by some bad people when he was working in the farmer, then her uncle who tried to marry her mother after Esperanza's father died, he burned Esperanza house.Second her grandmother felt a little bad and Esperanza and her mother run away from EL rancho de las rosas.Then they went to california and started a new life."
3,Not enough Misty Mundae,There's only one scene feauturing Misty Mundae. The only good thing is that the scene is extended in the special features section. The movie is okay for a low budget horror/slasher movie.It tends to follow the cliches of the other late 90's slasher movies like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. If you can watch a movie and not take it too serious then this movie is okay. The story involves a double murder that tramautizes the tow main characters and leads them to believe that all male college students are evil. Roxanne Michaels plays the Poetry teacher using her sex appeal to lure the frat boys into a cave to die. This is what some might call a bad movie. but this is a bad movie that could be enjoyed if given the chance.
2,Interesting Effort,"This had a lot of potential, but ultimately, the errors on film detracted from the effort. As an example, one of the dead students actually and obviously blink after theyr'e dead. This type of mistake is normal in a filmmakers early releases, but for a nationwide distribution...it should have been caught."
2,"GREAT IDEA, DECENT IMPLEMENTATION","ACTING C+, STORY B-The idea of a female serial killer seducing young, horny nitwits sounds like a good screenplay for a movie. This is not that good movie. First , it is a bit unrealistic to think that none of these big, tough, athletic college boys could not deliver a swift elbow, fist or knee to Nora, to escape her, oh so loose grip. The actor who played Nico did a good job. Nora was a little over the top. The death scenes were not believable. I did not believe that the victims were fighting for their lives. I would actually give this movie 2.5 stars. The idea of a female serial killer is always refreshing to this genre, but except for the big screen Eileen Warmose movie, I have yet to see it carried out successfully. This was a good attempt though and actually worth wataching again."
5,To the bottom,Excellent product for your tall tank. Allows the filter to take in more debris. Did exactly what I needed it to do.
1,Replacement tube,"This is a replacement tube for the one that already comes with the product. It cannot be use to ""extend"" the tube for a taller tank without restricting water flow, as the name implies."
4,White Houses Vinyl,"This review isn't about the song, but the vinyl itself. It's sort of odd how they did this record. It's a promo, released before the album ""Harmonium"" and advertises such.There's some interesting things about this record that I thought I'd point out:1. despite only having 1 title on it, they put it on a 33rpm 12"" instead of a 45rpm 7"", which I find odd2. there's a side A and B, both of which sound to be the exact same version (studio) of ""White Houses"". there's no obvious editing (censoring or shortening) between them.3. like I just said, they're the same song, but one side takes up 1/3 of the available space on the record, while the other takes up 1/2.4. the quality of the recording isn't superb. my guess is because it's promotional, but i have other promo vinyls that are normal.for the price and availability, it's a good buy and i'm glad i have it. it's the only release of hers on vinyl."
3,Sam,"This is a quirky new single from an artist who does not receive a great deal of publicity. Slighty more fast paced than any of her previous tracks, this song still contains the familiar piano jingles we have come to expect from her songs. The lyrics are clever and consistent throughout the song. A slight fault, and only slight, is that you get the impression she shouts words rather than sings them during the verses. But that aside this song is fresh original and what we'd come to expect from her! I'll hazard a guess and say it wil be in the top 20 in the UK music chart"
4,The Lives Of Many Are Changed,"Sally Baxter and her family decide that owning a small round house on the peaceful Cornish coast would be a great place to open a bed and breakfast, that is until the day that their first guests are to arrive and the body of a young village girl is found washed up on their beach.Now Sally find she is in for the fight of her life to protect one son and to defect another all the while trying to find out things about her husband and the other villagers that will leave her wondering if there really is solitude to be found.Though this is a mystery, the who done it part is rather easy to figure out, but the interplay between the characters is what makes this a more interesting read.First in the DCI Shannon series."
4,A book for motivation,"Excellent book for all teachers no matter what subjects they teach. Emily's ideas work well with all types of curriculum. This book is well written, easy to follow, and the ideas represented in it are worth reading!"
1,OUTRAGEOUS SHIPPING COST,"A shipping cost of $8.80 for a $1.99 hair net is OUTRAGEOUS! The item was shipped in a box that was way too big, when it could have been shipped in an an envelope for the postage cost of a regular letter.You can bet I will pay closer attention next time, but will not order again from this company.My rating is a big 0"
5,Money well spent,"/This installment is probably my favorite for The Hills Angels segments alone. Consider this one an investment in good times for many years to come, it just doesn't get better than Classic Benny. There is a tribute to Thin Lizzy's Boys Are Back in Town that Pits the Angels against Benny and the boys. You will not be dissapointed once you've seen The B-Team sping to action! All in all, The Complet Unadulterated Collection is a must for true Hill Heads."
2,Where did they fly to?,Love Benny Hill--but am still looking for a recording of Angels that doesn't require fast forwarding to get to the good stuff. Mislabeled package.
1,Poor Quality,This product looks better than most soap dispeners but mine worked for less than a month. The soap compartment leaked into the battery compartment. The batteries were ok but the pump stopped working.I e-mailed service@jeallton for warranty info but have heard nothing from them. The warranty is for one year and it is too late to return it to Amazon so I'm hoping Allton will stand behind their product.UPDATE: The Allton company replaced the defective pump with a new one for free and no need to send back the original product. It has worked perfectly. Apparently the trick is to dilute the liquid soap with a small amount of water otherwise the soap is too thick for the pump. I would now rate this product with 4 stars.
5,Great Dispenser!!!,We've had this dispenser for about a month and like it very much. It seems to be well constructed and works great! I really like the way it eliminates the usual soapy mess we normally have around the sink.
2,Ho Hum,"At first this worked great! After about 6 months, it sporadically dispensed soap until it emptied itself and still kept trying to dispense. I changed batteries thinking that was the problem to no avail. Machine still tried to dispense, even when empty unless I pulled the batteries to stop it. I contacted Allton to no avail. I am replacing it, but am researching for a better product. But, I gotta say - the concept rocks!"
2,Not what it was hyped up to be,"I gave this movie 2 stars because that's the number of times I laughed during it. It was another ""Something About Mary"" another smash I thought was highly overrated. When this was over I had the same feeling I had when I watched ""Mary"" and that was I had watched a movie,not a good movie,just a movie. There seemed to be something missing. It was supposed to be a comedy but there just wasn't anything funny about it. If you want to watch a movie,watch this. If you want to watch a good funny movie,watch ""Deuce Bigalow."" It actually pays off."
1,Big Dissapointment,"I bought this movie as soon as it was released on DVD, what a mistake! Me and my mate sat watching, what i was expecting to be one of the funnyest movies of the year, but i was bitterly dissapointed. Sure, there are funny parts in it, but the makers of this movie don't seem to realise that it takes more than the humour to make a good film. As we were watching, my mate was busting out with laughter at parts which were simple bordom.. i sighed and said ""you laugh at anything mate"". If you haven't seen this film yet, don't bother, cause it aint worth the 1 and a half hour it takes. One more thing, Heather Graham performed just as lousey as ever in this film, it would have been a better film if Sheila Broflowski played her part for her! (nothing new there huh?)"
1,Blow-finger,"It blew and I give it the finger. Not a nice one either. I was thoroughly unimpressed. I really haven't seen many movies lately with either Eddie Murphy or Steve Martin that have been worth watching. Maybe Steve needs to do the Jerk part 2 and Eddie, Beverly Hills Cop 4 or 5. This movie is watchable, but if you are at home sick from work. I really had high hopes and shouldn't have. If you want something funny this isn't it. UGGGHHHHHH!"
1,What a waste of potential talent,"As a very big Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy fan, I was VERY disapointed with this film. There was great potential in teaming these two comic talents together but the final film was very dull and a huge disapointment. Even the outakes were totally unfunny. If you want Steve Martins best then dump this and pick up Trains Planes and Automobiles."
3,A great premise and some fine comedic moments,"Bowfinger has a great premise and the teaming up of legendary comic geniuses Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy provides some very funny moments. Murphy's portrayal of the nerdy lookalike to Hollywood hotshot Kit is hilarious. Martin's script is filled with lots of little details that often prove to be the funniest parts of the film, such as the fleeting character ""Bob,"" who works at Mindhead and wears some startling apparel on his head. The storyline and characters are reminiscent of the Muppet Show, in that a hapless ragtag bunch of lovable characters attempt to mount a production in the face of terrible odds, and there are lots of romantic conflicts behind the camera/stage along the way. It's good family fare."
5,Clever and hilarious Hollywood spoof,"This is one of the funniest movies I have seen in awhile. Some people seem to think it's too silly, but I loved the premise. Eddie Murphy's character, the number one action star in America, has no idea Steve Martin's schlocky movie about aliens is being filmed around him while he goes about his daily routine. What's so funny is his character has a real life paranoia about aliens, and believes it's really happening! This is Eddie Murphy's best role ever, playing both the flashy paranoid superstar and his nerdy, lovable brother at the same time. I also loved Martin's gutsy, sarcastic spoof of Hollywood's Scientology groupies, called ""Mindbend"". All the characters are great, especially Heather Graham and Robert Downey Jr.'s small but funny role. Buy this movie!"
3,Good rental,"This movie was a good rental, however I think I would have been disapointed if I had shelled out the ""big bucks"" to see it at the theater. The idea of Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy together in one film together sounds like a comedic masterpiece in the making. The movie did not, in my opinion, use the comedy genius of either of these two actors to their fullest potential. Perhaps I was expecting too much, but when I saw the names Martin and Murphy in the same film I thought I would be on the floor laughing clutching my side from the pain. I only laughed out loud a couple of times and I think even one of those was forced.Like I said this was a good movie rental but nothing I would purchase or wish to watch a second time."
2,Not a great effort by two of the greatest comedians ever,"If Steve Martin could make one of the funniest movies ever with Michael Caine, of all people (Dirty Rotten Scoundrels), you'd think he'd be able to pull of one of the funniest movies ever made once he was teamed up with Eddie Murphy. Unfortunately, this is not the case and this movie truly is a run-of-the-mill hokey comedy. Oh well...now where's my copy of ""The Jerk"" to go regain my confidence in Steve...?"
4,This movie is so funny,I love this movie evreybody in thi movie is just wonderfull grate actors and actress's and I say if you want to see a good movie I say see this but this is corny so some stuff will be a bit dull so to speak.
4,Funny because it's true,"Bowfinger depicts a grotesque picture of hollywood. The big star with a little brain that is influenced by a cult (travolta?). A mediocre actress who sleeps her way to the middle and goes over the top as a lesbian (heche?). A director/casting agent who uses the groin more than the brain (just about all of them?). It isn't pretty, but it is funny. Steve Martin continous in his new vein as a comedian with a message while Eddie Murphy makes his first respectable comedy/movie since Beverly Hills Cop I."
4,Not perfect but a return to form for Steve Martin,"It is clear that Steve Martin is at his best when performing his own material. This film is for the most part excellent fun (though the ending doesn't quite come up to scrach). The DVD has some nice features, although it's a shame DVD outtakes never last more than a few mintues."
2,OUTTA HERE,"YOU KNOW, USUALLY YOU WOULD EXPECT A STEVE MARTIN MOVIE TO BE PRETTY ENTERTAINING. ALSO ONCE YOU HEAR THE NAME EDDIE MURPHY YOU ALMOST KNOW THAT THE MOVIE IS GOING TO BE GREAT. WELL, THIS IS THE EXACT OPPOSSITE OF ALL SAID. IT WAS ABOUT AS FUN TO WATCH AS, WELL, NOTHING! THE ONLY UP PART WAS WHEN EDDIE MURPHY SAID A FEW LINES THAT MADE YOU LAUGH. THE REST WAS A TREMENDOUS BORE.HERE'S AN ADVERTIXEMENT FOR YOU: HAVING TROUBLE TRYING TO SLEEP? WELL, BOWFINGER IS YOUR MOVIE, ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS BUY THE TICKET, BRING A PILLOW, AND YOU'LL FALL ASLEEP AND STAY THAT WAY TROUGHOUT THE MOVIE!"
2,Not Very Good,"I did not think this movie was very funny at all. The out-takes were probably the funniest, and they weren't all that good."
1,1 star is too much,I made the assumption that anything with Eddie Murphy is worth watching. Lets just say this movie proved me Wrong! Don't rent/buy/glimpse or wince at this trash of a film.
4,Don't look for hidden meanings,"I have heard many people say they loved this movie and many say they couldn't find the funny parts. For those of you who can't FIND them, stop looking because they are right in front of your face. Sure I agree, this movie didn't have me laughing through the whole movie like some others. But the humor was perfectly balanced between the smart a$$ comments from Steve Martin (along with the lies he came up with on his feet) and the perfect portrayal of brothers by Eddie Murphy. He played the part of a paranoid overzealous superstar actor to the T, and we all know that he could play the part of the (somewhat) introverted brother. I really enjoyed watching a movie with different humor for once."
4,REALLY< REALLY< REALLY GOOD...,"I'm not a Martin fan. The last films he made were totally forgetable. So, I was surprised after watching this film. Martin is the writer too!! The history is soft, briefly critical, enjoying, cleverly written, it never loses momentum. Murphy dispenses introduction. He's good as ever. A great example of intelligent comedy."
3,Steve Martin Is Fun!,"Bowfinger is one of those off beat movies that has some really special and funny movements but overall is not a standout.Frank Oz, a really intriguing director often has surprises in his feature. And this one is no exception. Eddie Murphy is very funny in his two roles and well as the always-inventive Steve Martin. This is really his film that he conceived and wrote.The film takes a nice slap at Hollywood and moviemakers of all kinds. Technically it is a funny and sharp film. The characters are purposefully broad and energetic. Some are over the top.I liked it. Its fun and I really enjoy watching Steve Martin. The DVD Extras are fun too! You'll have fun."
5,Eddie Murphy and Steve Martin Rule,"Looking at the reviews, it seems most people were expecting too much. My older brother told me, he didn't think it was special (he thought LA Story was beter) but my younger brother told me it was the best movie in a long time. I finally just bought the DVD. It is Awesome! It is not a so much as an equal collaboration between Eddie and Steve but seems more like a Steve Martin movie with Eddie Murphy in it.(which it is...Martin wrote the script). Martin character isn't as crazy as he is in some movies but the script and Murhpy's acting more than make up for the fact. These two should do another movie!"
2,Quite Dissappointing,You would think with such mega stars as Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy that this movie would be a laugh a minute. After sitting through this 96 minute video I would wonder if I could count the number of laughs on one hand. Eddie Murphy's two roles in this film are incredibly shallow. The nerdy brother of the film star is quite annoying and the film star just rants and runs. Steve Martin is constantly telling stupid lies throughout the movie which for the most part are unfunny. The movie promotions staff were smart to not waste money selling this movie in the theatre's. It is a fairly dissappointing and avoids my one star rating because1) it is basically lighthearted and 2) just by showing up Murphy and Martin can rouse a chuckle or two. Look elsewhere when renting comdies.
2,Disappointing,"I SHOULD have like this movie. I WANTED to like this movie.But i didnt.Something was missing. Im not entirely sure what, but I found myself bored.Sure, there are some funny moments. But the dialog falls short, the characters are weak, and it just FEELS like a vehicle for Martin and Murphy rather than a quality film that happens to include them.Nevermind. Better luck next time."
2,ha ha ha ?,"""Where are the laughs?"" one might ask when watching this movie. You will find about 2 genuine laughs and a chuckle here and there. The story went nowhere although it started with lots of potential to be a riot. If you have seen the commercials and previews for this movie, well, lets just say you have already seen the good parts."
5,O my what a great movie!,"I'm looking over the reviews people gave, ""Bowfinger,"" the reviews are terrible! This is such a great movie. There are laughs all the time! It is terrible to see people who are ""Top 500"" reviewers, and there giving this movie a bad grade! This movie is such a hollywood movie, this is waht define Hollywood. It is such a different comedy instead of those comedy's out no. Don't get me wrong but this movie is so intelligent! First off, all the actors give such a good performence. Second, It's not a comedy that jsut drags on, which is always good. Third you don't get bored of the characters. Although most people don't mainly look for that in a movie it is something that all movie people should look for. This is such a good movie, go get it!"
5,Corny Movie Producer,This is a good and funny movie especially with Steve Martin. Its about a nutball movie producer trying to get his hit movie off the ground. This means getting the movie made without the star knowing about it because he turned it down or refused to see him I dont remember which. Its been a while since Ive seen it. One thing I do remember-sorry for an obvios small spoiler- is that the star thought he was going crazy each time they filmed a scene and went running to his therapist since he was in thearapy. Anyway you should see it.
5,I love this movie!!!,I have fond memmories of watching this movie with my mom as a kid. Its still hilarious and I would recommend it.Not for children under 15 or so.
5,Steve Martin and Eddy Murphy at their very best.,Its one of the funniest movies of all time.Both Steve Martin and Eddy Murphy excel.I don't think that I have ever watched a movie as many times as I have this one and I never tire of it.Nothing short of Brilliant!
4,Funny Satire of Hollywood,"When watching Steve Martin's take on the Hollywood process, I couldn't stop thinking about ""The Player"", the Robert Altman film with Tim Robbins. It's the same take on the perverse nature of Hollywood, from an obviously different perspective.Bowfinger is funny. Eddie Murphy is a great caricature of an action film. The barbs pointed at Scientology are as funny as they are obvious (how did Martin not get sued by the paranoid, litigious religion?).The only complaints are that the film seems to drag at points.As for the DVD extras, all I can say is that Christine Baranski does not come across as someone I would want to have dinner with. She appears to take herself, her role, and this film FAR too seriously. Perhaps she was remaining in character (unforutunately, I don't think so)."
5,The BEST!,"Callin Levi is absolutely one of the best Christian Bands! The originate from Townsend Delaware and I saw them for the first time at Townsend Free Will Baptist Church! Amazing, simply amazing!Get all their CD's!"
2,somewhat disappointing,"I practice and teach Kundalini Yoga, and as much as I would like to give this book a higher rating, I just can't. I whole-heartedly agree with Dorothy Elder's contention that Kundalini energy and the Holy Spirit are one and the same, but her book just left me cold. The passages from the Bible which she ""reinterprets"" struck me as highly contrived. This topic needs to be explored and brought forth in our modern world and this book is a valiant attempt to do so, but it just comes up short somehow."
2,A good read about the 1960's,"This book is a good overview of the 1960's from a man who was heavily involved in the politics of the time. It is not a book which comes without its biases as Mr. Goodwin definitely portrays himself in a light which is glorious. If a reader can look beyond his self glorifying rhetoric, they will find good insights of this extremely important era."
4,A smile on my face...,"This is the new album of the trash-legends Anvil. I like this CD(this is the only one I have so, I have no point of reference); fast and powerful songs, old-trash-school-like. What really caught my attention of these dudes (besides the good songwriting) is the sense of humour they show in the songs. You can take a look at the titles: ""Park that truck"", ""Mattress mambo"".My favorites are ""Park..."", ""Speed of sound""(really heavy and powerful)and ""No Evil"". You will find really cool songs from a band that seems to enjoy(more than usual) what they're doing. If you like trash or heavy metal, get this CD."
1,Random Nothing,This movie has an extremely weak story line. Though Harrison Ford finds out that his wife was having an affair with Kristin Scott Thomas' husband he keeps looking for something. Scenes in this movie come out of no where. This movie is incredibly boring and is not worth watching at all. When I finished this movie I thought I had been sitting there for 4 hrs. The only good thing about this movie is that it ends. Using Leonard Maltin's scale I would give this movie BOMB meaning this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I would not give this movie any stars except I can't do that with the field. So I have to type BOMB.
1,LOSER,"I'm not disppointed because Ford did this movie and I only'like him as an action charcter. No way. I'm disppointed simply because the movie has a bad screenplay, that left Ford and THomas totally without control of their lousy characters, with no life at all. Bad motion picture. Don't recommend it to anyone."
3,Can you get any more mediocre,"Well, this movie is one of the best movies ever. It is also one of the worst movies ever. It is the most interesting, but also the most boring. Basically, it has it's ups and it definetly has it's downs. The first half hour or so is the type of stuff that I would like to see a whole feature length film dedicated to, but the rest, well... Let's just say it tries to create yet ANOTHER ""I wanna figure out if my wife was cheating on me!"" type of film. My advice: Rent it before you buy it, becuase it could be an awesome film to you, but it could be a terrible film. It showed so much promise, but it also showed so much junk."
2,Almost his worst film,"It wasn't the worst, but it was close. The story line is creative, but drags constantly. If you are bored and want a movie that will SLIGHTLY entertain you.....this is it. It seems as if Hollywood doesn't have many good films to produce this year. Harrison Ford is a great actor, but this film doesn't help his career at all!"
1,Lost without a cause,"Next to the bomb Wild Wild West with Wil Smith, I came so close to turning this movie off and burning the DVD - then I remembered I rented it - The complete dulling pace of this movie, and the inability for the characters to communicate drove us nuts. It was like a bad episode of NYPD Blue where people go sentances without speaking words -- The movie just dragged, and the characters left you feeling like this could never happen -- was this of the fantasy genre? Don't waste your money."
3,Good film.,"I likde this film. It had a different pace and was told differently from most of Hollywood's film which are made nowadays- and that is a good thing. Well acted, especially by Harrison Ford -this was a real surprise to me. This movie is not pretencious and luckily doesnt fall in too many cliches. Cute film...."
1,Yawn!,"This movie looked good; good soundtrack, the actors appeared mismatched... both were dry and boring...I could understand why their partners had affairs...i wish we could have spent time getting to know the passion between the deceased partners first, before they were killed off... they seemed more interesting. I like Harrison in action movies, because he is more believable. Hollywood is always searching for that ""Grace Kelly"" cool in leading women.Ms. Scott-Thomas was a bit too cool to the point of ice....And men like that?"
2,Great Performance By Kristen Scott Thomas,"This movie is very dark and unrelentlessly depressing, but it is worth watching one time because of Kristen Scott Thomas's performance. She is great at playing the part of an emotionally repressed widow who has found out her husband was having an affair. I think it is good that a movie has been made that is trying to be different from all the other movies currently being made, but this movie is just not very good. The whole storyline about the dirty cop that Harrison Ford is trying to track down just doesn't blend with the movie, and it made absolutely no sense in the movie. I hope a better movie dealing with an unusual romance will be made."
2,Very Average&drawn out,Harrison Ford&Kristin Scott Thomas have Great Talent.but this film involving Sydney Pollack is all over the place worth all The Drama.The Writting is really off&the pacing makes no sense.Dennis Haysbert&Charles Dutton are Wasted here.this film is trying for something but nothing really ever catches on.
1,Harrison Ford downfall...,"I can never believe such a successful actor could fail this way!This movie could be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in the Cinema history... it has a meaningless story, bad acting, and is so stupid!If you want to say a star fall so bad, watch this movie... but do not ever consider buying it, or you'll be sorry!"
3,INTERESTING FILM,"a mature film that seems to go against the usual norms and audience expectations nowadays, there are obvious problems with the plot and especially the second half of the movie, cannot fail to see some Kubrick influences, an interesting attempt overall"
2,Skip this one!,I am a fan of Harrison Ford. No matter how talented an actor is...they can not save a movie with a bad story. The whole story behind Random Hearts is totally unbelievable. The chemistry between Harrison and Kristin Scott Thomas just does not work. I was highly disappointed by this movie. Unless you are a diehard Harrision Ford fan and you want this to add to your collection.....Rent this first!
1,"Two Thumbs Down - Gene Siskel, The Daily Pearly Gate","A movie so bad that even Gene Siskel had to reach out from beyond the grave to give a two thumbs down. I first saw it on HBO and quickly wrote them a note saying it was the first time I'd wish they had commercials. My favorite part is a line that Kristen Scott Thomas says about an hour and a half into the movie. She says ""I've found it"" - I was praying it was the plot but no such luck. The best part of this movie is clearly the end - but that I mean the credits - you finally know this regrettable show is finally over. If you are unfortunate enough to see this movie, in the last two hours and fifteen minutes of your life whisper ""Random Hearts"" to those around you - you'll beg for this time back. I'd suggest if you interested in seeing something more exciting try watching paint dry.Amazon is too kind allowing a 1 star minimum - If this movie is anything celestial it would have to be ""space junk""."
2,Give Her a Star,"Ford has often been given interesting and exciting roles, but he has never been an interesting or exciting actor. He always looks surprised at his success, and I'll bet he really is. The 'why me?' syndrome is written all over his face - when there's any believable expression there at all. But he's actually worse here than in anything else I've seen him in. (Admittedly, his part is that of a hopeless jerk, which doesn't help.)Scott-Thomas is always wonderful, even in this, but rarely can she lift a mediocre film up all by herself. As Mr. Winslow says in ""The Winslow Boy"", it's a ""forlorn quest."" The second star is for her. If Amazon offered a zero star option, this would rate one star.There's one long scene of a conversation between Ford and Scott-Thomas in her Washington home that was obviously shot by each actor on a different day. Ford's body-double must be a more animated actor than Ford because Scott-Thomas plays the scene beautifully."
2,ALL I KEPT THINKING WAS WHAT A BIG PEST HARRISON FORD SEEMED,LIKE...AND I'M A FAN OF HIS. The premise was interesting and had potential...two strangers are thrown together after their cheating spouses are killed in a plane crash. But it never went anywhere. Harrison Ford plays a police officer and there is a sub-plot that adds not a thing to the movie. Kristin Scott Thomas is good in her role...much better than Harrison Ford who basicly plays a nudge. Thomas just wants to be left alone...Ford just wants...well...something...closure I suppose. Although why he chooses to look for it in Ms Thomas' Levi's is beyond me. I like both of these actors just look for them in other moveies. This one was a dud.
3,"Random Hearts, actually a good movie",Last night I rented Random Hearts and was waiting to be disapointed by the movie since I scaned some of the reviews in Amazon. To my pleasant surprise the movie actually was very entertaining and even though it is a long running film it seemed to go by quickly. I never had the feeling that the movie was wasting my time or that the plot was thin. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
2,???,"I thought something, some kind of big secret, a ""shock"" would be discovered, of course more than the affair, or ""the affair"" is just for cover something...until ""the end"", so I felt lost and empty after seeing this movie. One is a cop, another is a congressman, their wife and husband died together in this horrible way, and they are always so serious...and this film is so serious and cold...it is a thrill style, isn't it? I understand ""the affair"" is a serious object to the two alive people, but by this way??? It is not a bad movie, but I couldn't feel satisfied after the director did his job like this. He's given us some wrong implication. I think we should add something into this movie, let the alive people find out some truth we normal people really call ""truth"", then the movie will be perfect. 2.5 stars actually."
1,Thumbs Down,"I was terribly disappointed by a movie with actors as classy as Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas. There seemed to be no acting at all in this movie- just a constant plodding from one scene to the next. Also, the relationship between the two leads is absolutely unbelievable so soon after the deaths of their respective spouses who they supposedly loved. This movie had no real plot, certainly did not live up to the description on the movie cover, and was a real dud. The only surprise in the movie came with the apparent ease of getting into Kristin Scott Thomas's pants. Do yourself a favor and don't watch it."
1,"I am not particularly critical, but...","This movie is really terrible. At its heart, Random Hearts lacks a coherent story. Sydney Pollack has tried (with miserble results, I might add) to overlap Ford and Thomas's sordid love affair with her campaign and (even more un-interestingly) an Internal Affairs investigation that Ford is embroiled in. The peripherals are negligible and the core is rotten. On the whole, a blemish on Ford's fine career. Definitely, two thumbs down!"
3,Morosely silly,"Two people find out their spouses were cheating, then the jilted ones get together. You'd think this never happened in the history of mankind, from the relentlessly grim way that Harrison Ford plays it. You'll laugh every time someone calls him ""Dutch."" I liked the relaxed soundtrack, though. Why this has to go on for over two hours, I don't know. It's silly soap opera to the core, but it's not the worst movie of its ilk ever made."
3,Well-made and not typical.,"I had barely known a thing about Random Hearts before I decided to give it a view. It turned out to be better-than-good. Random Hearts wasn't a simple movie to digest. It was quite thought-provoking and had more substance to it than most current movies that I've seen lately. The film sported some above-average qualities: very good acting (especially Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas), nice character development, good cinematography, and a cohesive plot for example. This movie was also very well-made on a technical level. Although Random Hearts was a long movie, it still kept a good pace and I never lost interest or got bored. It wasn't an empty action flick either; I do admit that it was quite morose though. A better than average film. I actually rate it 3.5 stars."
1,Is Ford in a Coma during this one?,"Man, for the most part, i've always enjoyed Fords movies. And I do still enjoy his stuff. But this one, my god, I couldn't take in enough coffee to stay awake for it. I was very bored during the whole movie. Harrison reminded me of a monotone Priest give a 90 minute sermon. I'd suggest watching Raiders of the lost ark, backwards before watching this."
4,HAUNTING ROMANCE,"Internal affairs cop Dutch Van den Broeck just lost his wife in a plane crash. Congresswoman Kay Chandler's husband died in the same accident. As it is revealed that their spouses were having an affair, they find their own ways of dealing with the tragedy: she wants to forget it and he is obsessed with knowing his wife's secrets.This was a very good movie and not predictable. Ford was excellent in this, I would say it is one of his best."
2,Random Hearts,"The DVD came on a timely basis. I just had a chance to watch it yesterday, 12/6/08. The DVD had a bad place about half way through the movie. I guess that's to be expected with a used copy. I will think twice about ordering used in the future."
3,The worst video transfer I have seen,"This movie is worth watching, not great but ok. However it has to be the worst DVD video transfer I have seen to date. Portions of the movie are so bad it looks like you are watching on a computer screen in 256 colors. Also while black level on DVDs is not great, it is really bad in this movie. Anything dark looks like digitized impressionistic artwork."
1,disappointment!!,"I thought this movie was a big disappointment. Harrison Ford plays a widow who finds out his wife was on a plane with her lover when they both die in the crash. He wants to know why his wife had an affair and how could she have lied to him and how long and how serious...blah, blah. All he did was whine the entire movie. Also, he plays a police officer and not a very good one. This movie lacked substance and character."
2,Bad movie night,"This is a movie that you can invite your friends over and make fun. I am a HUGE Harrison Ford fan, but he looked ridiculous in this movie. He definitely was not ready for his close up - There is a close up of him that will make you cringe (earring, dyed hair and all), for he looks every bit his 60-something age. - playing a top cop no less. Kristen Scott Thomas seemed to be in another movie, slipping in and out of an English accent. The music was shockingly dopey. There was NO chemistry between them. The plot and subplot tedious. Need I go on! View for the giggles. Gave two stars for this reason alone."
4,Deadly Snakes in the Garage,"If you are a fan of garage rock, then you should give this alblum a chance. It is by no means a classic, it has many rough edges, but isn't that what garage rock is all about. If you enjoy Johnathin Richmond and the Modern Lovers, you will easily hear the influence they had on this band. Its solid rock music, that you can tap your toe too."
5,Stax Soul + Punk Rock + Beer,"What a relief to hear a young band playing good straight ahead rock and roll for the fun of it. If you like The Animals, Real Kids, early Stones, Them, Rocket from the Crypt, Detroit Cobras, etc. then you'll like this. Soulful vocals, farfisa organ & horns show off the R&B influence, but they never descend into the corny retro schtick that plagues so many garage type bands. This is good time rock & roll at it's best & the record's almost as much fun as their live show."
4,He does it again,Almost every track on the album is top quality.....Although these new tracks singles haven't made much noise in the American market (which is fickle when it comes to reggae anyway) his new tracks are getting much deserved air play and respect back in Jamaica
5,"Go ""Undercover"" and enjoy!","This polished romantic thriller will keep your heart racing from the get-go. B. W. Starmer draws you in immediately with her gorgeous, complex heroine and her mysterious, handsome hero. She masterfully weaves a web of suspense and passion in this heart-stopping novel. Go ""Undercover"" and enjoy it - it is an excellent read."
4,Undercover,I was browsing and decided to try someone new when I found this book. I'm a romantic at heart and to say this book touched me is an understatement. Just the right touch of action mixed with romance to make me feel I was part of the story. Casey is the perfect heroine and I want to know where I can find a man like Britt Black. If this is the author's first book then I can't wait for more.It's a modern story based in the early nineties about a woman who is obsessed with eliminating the world of drug dealers. Not to spoil the plot but she finds her perfect counterpart and almost loses it all. I highly recommend this book if you just want to relax and have a good read. I couldn't put it down once I got started. Just enough romance to fill the tension and I always enjoy cliffhangers to make me want more.Beverly Brugger
5,A Christian Life,"Although I'm not much into hip-hop, I truly enjoyed this album. The beats are incredible (!) but more importantly, all of the songs take you through the journey of a genuine Christian life. From witnessing (Yes, It is What it Is), to repentance (This Is Me, Hear This), to walking by faith (Faith, Have What You Want)... Kierra and team found a way cater to everyone. I've found that in many ""young adult"" gospel albums, there's much high-energy praise and sad songs of repentance for besetting sins, but not a great deal of material that identifies with the lives of young preachers, teachers, evangelists or people who are just decidedly Christian. I appreciate Kierra's ability to keep it real but also ""let no man despise [her] youth"" when it comes to being a soldier for the kingdom. Good job."
4,Pretty good Cd,This is cd was good. I liked more songs on her other cd I owe you. I only liked a few songs on this one. If you like listening to different varities of gospel music you'll like it.
2,"Too Many Producers, Not enough quality","Kierra first cd was stellar. It was a great sound for a person with such a strong voice in a youthful body. But the new album is a total disappointment. The problem may be that Ms. Sheard has not found her signature sound yet and she has too many producers who have put their sound on her voice. Ms. Sheard's talent is lost in too hype beats and over induced lyrics.I know Kiki is a great talent, I am not downplaying her. But this album does not showcase the skills I know that she has. You may not be happy with this purchase, but it's worth a try."
2,could have been better,"I enjoyed Kiki's first album which sounded more like her. I would have to agree with one of the reviews on how this album did not sound like her. It almost sounds as if she is younger than 18. There's a lot of head bobbin' music on this album which I do not particularly like. I wish this album was more of a mixture of sounds like her first album. I heard snippets of all of the songs on my computer through Windows Media Player, and from what I heard, I do not think I want to go out and buy this. I only enjoyed one song which was ""Why Me."" I heard this song on my way to church on the radio and it really touched me because inspite of what I am dealing with in my life right now, God sees all my mess and junk and still loves me. I wish she had that song out on a single, I would definitely go and get it. I hope in the future, that she will work with producers who will bring her sky-cracking voice back. Hint hint (PAJAM)"
2,Adequate,"Lack of dimensional information in listing make difficult to know if this design will fit in close quarters of flip down door. Standard tray is also available from same vendor which has lower front wall, allowing for tighter space."
3,Why again?,"I am a huge Faith No More fan. But why do they insist on releasing yet another greatest/best of compilation? The majority of the material is the same stuff on previous ones. Throw us a bone and give us a few new tidbits... something, anything. If it ain't there, then don't peddle it. One last thing to anyone who might have a say on what goes on these greatest/best of ... 'The Real Thing' is the most overlooked song that never got the play. The 3 stars are not for the material, just for getting it again and again."
5,Perfect!,"My daughter was all a-buzz to get some Adventure Time under the tree for the holidays! She watched the whole disk in one sitting, no problems with the quality."
2,NO MORE RANDOM SELECTIONS!!!,"i agree with most reviews, frederator and warner bros needs to make a FULL season dvd! its driving me redonk! the first dvd came out with a random selection then the second dvd too, but now the third adventure time dvd comes out with all episodes of season 1... dont get me wrong, im happy about it, but im just pissed how i bought the two other ones and then get season 1 which has some same episodes as the other discs... i mean its kind of a waste of money! ill be happy if they keep coming out with full seasons instead of those redonk random selections... for glob sake people! make the flippin full season dvds! people might not write terrible reviews... so do it for all hardcore fans like me and make the rest of the full season dvds! me, im just buying all dvds for adventure time that come out because i just wanna collect them... you know how it is... but still come out with those full season dvds! im dying for glob sake!"
4,"It may not be a season DVD, but it's still mathmatical!","I got this as a gift, and although I wasn't originally going to buy the Adventure Time DVD's until the season sets came out, I was more than happy to get this as a gift. There's an incredible amount of episodes on this, about 180 minutes, and most of them are really good ones. And my favorite part was when I opened it up and saw what was on the disk face! Can I just say, oh my glob?So although I totally understand the idea of not wanting the ""selected episodes"" verses a complete full season DVD, I don't see why there are so many negative ratings. This is an awesome collection of episodes, and even though Season 1 DVD is coming out soon, it makes a radical addition to my DVD collection."
1,Full seasons please.,"CN is doing it again. Selecting random episodes and selling them to us. Maybe Nickelodeon could get away with it with their random mix-and-match of Spongebob tapes and DVDs, but Adventure Time is too amazing of a show to jerk around. Don't buy this waste of money."
1,an insult to fans...,"and lets face it, fans like me are the ones who would EASILY shell out the cash for the entire seasons on disc (with extras!) but to have yet another ""sampler"" of the season is a bad joke. Not spending my money on this - which sucks, because Adventure Time is one of the best cartoons ever with total replay value."
2,at this point you need full seasons...,"It is ridiculous that again there is another random selection of episodes from this fantastic show. its not even that the collections arent full seasons...you just are not listening to fans of the show. if you go on the message board on cartoonnetwork.com fans of the show list their favorite episodes and guess which ones are not on the dvd...foolish. if you wont listen to your fans who are you listening to? this collection is missing among others: ""what was missing"", ""fiona and cake"", and many many other fan favorites. please cartoon network stop showing us your favorites and give us full seasons!"
1,Take a Stand or this random release series will continue,"I love this series....BUT I refuse to buy these DVD collections of random episodes. I would hope that they are reading these comments and will bow to our requests for Complete Season sets. I have been burned in the past by buying the cheapo small collections and then being forced to buy the same episodes over again when an organized set is released. I know that many of these DVDs are being sold to parents for their kids.....but I think they would sell many more if organized collections were being offered. Could it be a money grab or is it just ignorance on the part of the releasing company? In either case, someone should wake up.....How do the real fans of this classic series get noticed and respected?"
1,Sadly,"As mentioned in several of the other reviews, Cartoon Network has yet to release a season collection of Adventure Time, despite the fact that the show is now on it's fourth season. I am not a huge fan of the digital-only purchase, I would prefer to hold an actual product in my hand at the end of the day, but Apple's iTunes store has each of the previous seasons available for $19.99, as well as a Season Pass for the current season that updates bi-weekly with new episodes (at the same price.) I am also not a fan of the iTunes proprietary file type (it can basically only be played in iTunes or on Apple devices,) but this is the only season collection of the series that exists to date, to the best of my knowledge. Sadly, Amazon video does not yet offer this series within their instant video collection. If ever they do, I would recommend that over iTunes, just for the accessibility of the file format."
1,greed,"This DVD gets zero stars (but it will show 1 (one) because it would not let me leave zero. I'm so sick of studios putting out random episodes of cartoons...adult and child alike. It's quite sad when things like this and Yo Gabba Gabba for example, come out with random episodes on scattered DVDs rather than season box sets. Ridiculous.The body of work equals an A-Plus. The DVD delivers a whopping F-Minus (worse than failing)."
2,in the words of LSP...,"What the LUMP is going on around here(insert valley girl accent)?? Can we please stop messing around and just come out with the entire seasons already?? For people that are just curious of all the low ratings it has zero to do with the show its self which is a 5 out of 5 all day its the ""random episode"" thing that cartoon network is doing here."
1,Fantastic Show...,"...But an absurd DVD. As virtually everyone else has said, the Cartoon Network really needs to put out full seasons. People across all demographics love this show! It is patently ridiculous to sell the show piecemeal. I hope someone in a position to do something about this reads this review!"
2,Does anyone have a list of episodes on this DVD?,Just wondering what is on this one.This is a GREAT show.I wish they had all of the seasons together.Low rating due to mix of episodes.5 Stars for the show itself.*************EDIT************I found out what is going to be on this one:The DVD will feature the following episodes:It Came From the NightosphereRainy Day DaydreamWizardPower AnimalEnchiridionSlumber Party PanicThe Real YouMemory of a MemoryPrisoners of LoveCrystals Have PowerBusiness TimeMystery TrainGuardians of SunshineThe MonsterHit ManThe Creeps
3,"C'mon guys, release the seasons. :c","I got this cause I got tired of waiting for them to release season 2.But it's more of a waste of money, cause it has some repeats from season 1, (rainy day daydream, the Enchiridion!, slumber party panic, prisoners of love, and business time.) and when they DO release season 2.(Finally have a date for it) it'll have repeats from that.But enough with the whinin'~ The episode choices actually are good. And all the smaller sets like this, gives them less reason to jack up the prices for the seasons. So all the dvd's are decently priced. c:"
4,i want a full season of adventure time NEW,i think that we should get the new season on a DVD that will be money well spent i mean i bought the dvd with the hat and its amost like the one when you take the case off his hair shows and its only like 3 episodes that are differnt oh yeah and it would be nice to have a DVD with just Fiona and cake
5,gotta stop hating,"Adventure time has been blazing every since it was created and as a fan there is no reason to hate. Yes, its not in complete seasons but for like $14 there should not be complaining while some ""seasons"" of shows sell for $50. Yes, it might highlight some of the shows major episodes but as of now it seems we will see a lot more adventure time so do not worry."
5,ON NOES I BOUGHT MORE THAN ONE DVD AND SUPPORTED SOMETHING I LIKE MONETARILY.,"I bought this, and I am happy I did. Sometimes it's nice to have different assortments of episodes on different discs. I'll admit that, at first, I was annoyed that there were only these random episode DVDs. But I realized that more money going into Adventure Time means more merchandise. I can deal with it. And this one has some really great episodes, so it made me happy."
1,Not falling for this either.,"I rate this 1 star because it's an insult to my intelligence to try and get me to shell out cash for something that I'll pay for AGAIN once the full seasons are released. Nope. **** you, CN. Have the balls to produce the full season straight up, or else don't. Otherwise, you ain't getting a single dollar from me."
2,"Too ""easy""!","Most everyone in my class felt that this book, while having an interesting format, was irritating to use. There is no basic glossary of word parts and combining forms, only an index that lists the exercise number where the item can be found. Normally, I might say that this facilitates learning through practice rather than rote, but many of the index references are incorrect! Apparently, they have not been updated since the previous edition. This also makes the book useless as a reference. Also, the way the book categorized body systems made little sense. For instance, why is the pulmonary system included in the section on the special senses? I give this book a C-."
2,"Rudimentary, riddled with errors","I went through this book page by page as part of a medical transcription course. Having somewhat of a medical background, I found this book to be very rudimentary. I was hoping to get a more thorough and detailed knowledge of medical terminology. In the chapter relating to my particular field, there were words that I suppose you could use, based on the root words and prefixes/suffixes, but were just ridiculous...never actually used in the field. This book is also riddled with errors, particularly in the review exercises. It looks to me as though no one edited this book. I am disappointed that I spent so much money for such shoddy work. I gave it two stars instead of one because the ""programmed learning"" format seems to work well."
2,errors,"I agree with other reviewers who commented that there are errors in this book. The accompanying disc is helpful, however, there are errors on it, as well. The disk also falsely corrects your practice quizzes. It says you were incorrect when you have the answer correct."
1,Don't waste your money,I am taking a medical terminology class at the vo-tech school in my area. The entire class and the instructor are very disappointed in this book because it is full of errors. For people who are new to medical terminology and have no medical backgrounds this book is very confusing at times and I wonder if I am really learning the correct terms. The instructor has already said that she is going to buy new books for her next class.
4,Fandamntastic...,"The Chi-Lites had that classic sound of the seventies that can never be reproduced or copied. After two decades later with this CD, they are not redefining any new sound but they have a collection that you cannot criticise or not play for that candle lit evening. This is great music for a dark room, one candle (pass on Just You and I Tonight though-it doesn't fit nor belong) and your loved one. I really like this CD!"
3,good text,"T.R. does a great job in painting a word picture of his safari. You can almost see it. If your sensitive to racism you may be offended by some of his comments. I'm sure he meant no harm after all it was written a century ago.The big thing for this publisher is the picture reproduction in the book, it is down right poor. That is why I rated it only three stars."
2,Interesting but too much drudgery.,"Great descriptions of some fine hunts against dangerous game and great commentary on the local human wildlife so to speak. It's unfortunate that liberal revisionists have tried to paint a vision of Africa that simply is not so nor ever was. Unfortunately the book is filled with too much 'Today I shot this, that and the other thing' which becomes really damned dull after awhile."
2,Hard to stay with the President.,"Mr. President is long winded and goes off on tangents. It is hard to stay with him. The reading experience is further hindered by the format of the Capstick Library books-the pages are made to look tattered and do not have clean edges. The photography in the book is ""state of the art early 1900's"" and is lacking."
2,African Game Trails (Capstick Library),"I purchased a copy of this book and am extremely disapointed with the quality of the photographs. They are so fuzzy and out-of-focus as to be useless--in some cases unrecognizable. I'm suprised that you offer such a poor quality volume for sale. I coresponded with the publisher and the nice young lady offered to send me another copy but added ""I looked at the pictures and they're terrible."" I replied that I already had one lousy copy and did not need another. You should check the quality of this volume carefully....it's terrible!"
2,No Title,"Soooo glad to have finished this one. Written in 1909, 1910, immediately after Roosevelt left the Presidency and went to Africa in March, 1909, for the Smithsonian, to shoot a zillion animals and bring back their hides and heads for the collections. He went with his son Kermit, who shot most of the very fuzzy black and white pictures in the book, and more animals even than his father. He was about 20 then. It is a picture of colonial East Africa at that time, and of Western man's thinking about the black natives, who were ""children"". Thankfully, that sort of mind-set has disappeared. But you can see here that Roosevelt had it in spades. Too bad some of his bearers did not write their own accounts."
2,infidelity in a regency...,"From the blurb on the book, I suspected this regency was about an affair, and I was right.The hero-Adam, is a war hero and Amanda-are thrown together when Adam is secretly trying to find a French Spy.I won't go further into the book in case you choose to read it.I personally quit this book because I don't read romances, definately regencies, to read about infidelity.I was pretty sure the author was going to set the husband up as a villian to ""justify"" the affair-but she made a mistake when she had the hero living at their home as a guest. And this is no school room miss-she's been married some years and has children-so the husband would have to have been truly evil for me to accept the adultery-and it was not the case.The book also gives way too much info about the war-the first 40 or so pages are predominately just that-boring.In my opinion this is not one of Miss Wolf's better regencies. If you like traditional regencies I say skip this one.2 stars."
2,Book is a compromise,"There are better books on dining car recipes, including ""Dining by Rail"" and ""Dinner in the Diner,"" and both available through Amazon. And, there are more complete books on Fred Harvey, such as Stephen Fried's wonderful ""Appetite for America."" The cookbook portion of ""The Harvey House Cookbook"" is better than the space devoted to Harvey the man. Still, you'll be left hungering for more regardless of what you're looking for."
4,Fun History,"Little known history of the day of the railroads, especially of the Santa Fe and the Harvey Houses along the way. Fun to read and recipes too!"
4,can...not...get...songs...out...of...head,"kept hearing supersystem on pandora, finally bought this cd. Infectious songs that can't stop singing to myself. My tween daughter plays several tracks over and over."
4,Geared more for the practitioner than the patient.,"This book is well written with lots of useful information. It can be a bit dry at times and technical, but the anecdotal info keeps it interesting. I would recommend it."
2,"Great Idea, But Poor Quality and Service","I bought one of these for my grandmother for Christmas so she could be sent baby pictures, family pictures etc. without a computer. Fantastic - she has absolutely loved it. (We had to set it up for her - that was not necessarily intuitive and took longer than you'd expect.)But now it's only February, and the thing is broken - frozen on one picture for days. (And no, it's not locked. We've tried everything.) Customer service operates under limited hours and has impossible wait times; they're not available at all on weekends and they have not responded to my emails."
1,Expensive subscriptions,"We bought this but when we realized that you needed to pay an additional $99 for the annual service, we decided against it. We will be returning it.Nice idea, but in my mind it's a bit expensive when there are so many other ways to share photo albums online. Also disappointed that the marketing/packaging for the actual unit doesn't make the cost of the subscription to the service obvious."
1,Terrible customer service,"After unit broke, ceiva refused to honor 'life-time warranty' and made us go through dozens of customer-support interactions repeating the same steps over and over at every call.Insisted we order parts, sent the parts, had no record of sending parts at next call and insisted we order parts again, then found record of part order and expressed being very angry with us that they had sent the wrong parts and required us to repeat the process. Continued to refuse to send replacement and said their warranty only meant they would try and repair the device if we mailed it back to them at our own expense. **serious time waster"
1,Horrible service,"Ordered 3 weeks before Christmas this year. Was told several times that the frames were backordered and would not ship out until the week before Christmas, but that they would be expeditied.Come the last shipping day before Christmas and they are still backordered. Customer service is of no help.How is it that a company can make one (and only one) product and still not be able to come close to making Christmas needs? I mean, they could have locked me (3 frames) in for life as a customer with their wildly overpriced $12 a month service. The first year was included with the frames we bought, but I have no doubt that we would have kept the service for ease of use. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THEY CAN SCREW IT UP THIS BAD!!!!"
1,SORRY I DIDN'T READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING,"What a disappointment when Christmas morning my son started to set up the Ceiva 3 only to find that it would cost another 159.95 per year to make it work. We went back to the box looking in disbelief that we had missed this important information. BUT THE ADDITIONAL COST IS NO WHERE TO BE FOUND. It says ""free"" but no mention of the additional 99.95 to 159.95 needed to use their product. Such deception should not be allowed by companies who use Amazon to sell their products. We are sending this item back. If they deceived us once, how can they be trusted? Shame on Ceiva! I will never again fail to read the reviews BEFORE I BUY."
5,Among the Best of Dick Francis,"This is vintage Francis,a fine example of why Dick Francis' books are so very good. The hero is not a jockey, but an actor. As usual, Francis avoids stereotypes and gives his protagonist some complexity, best shown here in a poignant depiction of family life. Like all Francis protagonists, he's observant, wily, tough, determined, and a guy capable of thinking ""outside the box."" Technology and politics are dated, of course, but the plot can still hold me gripped from cover to cover, each time I reread it.There are a handful or so of Francis books that are not set in England. Of those, SMOKESCREEN (set in South Africa) and BLOOD SPORT (in the US) rank among my favorites.The torture section of this book is absolutely harrowing. You will never forget it."
4,Dick Francis books,"I've read almost all of his books over the years. My 13 year old grandaughter showed an interest in one of them and so I ordered it for her. I don't remember this one, but if she enjoys it, there are many more I can order for her."
5,Dick Francis is ALWAYS in first place!,"Dick Francis consistently writes books that people love to read -- again and again! I own all of his books and have had to replace some due to wear! I started in 1988 with The Edge and was hooked! Try any of his books and you will feel the same. Thank you, Dick Francis!"
2,Disappointment in Kindle version,"My boyfriend bought me a kindle for my birthday and the first book I downloaded was none other than a Dick Francis I hadn't already read. I love his books, and this was no exception, but the quality of the kindle copy was appalling. Spelling mistakes, incorrect words and bad punctuation. It marred my enjoyment of the book, and at over [...] I felt ripped off. I'd rather have the real book."
2,Do Not Buy If You Are Above 4500 FEET,"I think I would have been happy, if they had said this does not work over 4500 feet, but they didn't.... I purchased it, then found out that you need a ""dual regulator"", ""100 pound propane bottle"", etc. then after all that expense and it still wouldn't work, they asked my husband, ""What is your altitude?"" and found out that if you are over 4500 feet it doesn't work at all!!!! So now I am having to send it back, but they are paying for the shipping, but it took almost two weeks to get it in the first place, so how long before I get my money back?????"
5,"What can be said, Its oil","Best review is for amazon, great shipping/packaking, etc, what can be said, oil is oil , and since its consumed, and a work oil get the best value"
3,Takin' it to the Man!,"If you're tired (like me) of The Man keepin' you down, then Jim Brown is the brother you got to dig! Black Gunn is a satisfying slice of Mob mayhem vs. righteous dudes. Takin' it upside the head is Martin Landau as the Mob boss, doing a lot with a relatively small role. The soundtrack is real fine, especially the chase scene at the horsetrack. But can you believe that white boy trying to outrun the World's Greatest Running Back? Disrespect The Man and check this out!"
3,Michael Jackson can't touch this!,here you can find the music of the group that inspired all music groups from the Rolling stones to the Beatles...the legend that will last a lunchtime!
5,Keeps getting better,"This is unlike the first Rutles album which it was made with not too much effort, most songs just a music ripoff with changed lyrics, with a few brilliant original exceptions (Nevertherless, Cheese And Onions, Doubleback Alley, etc). Those were original songs inspired in beatles sound, with new lyrics AND music, and you could still tell in which song it was inspired. Well, most of the songs in Archeology are original, with music that stands on its own, sometimes is like The Beatles had made some more new songs. I love Eine Kleine, Joe Public, and the rest of them. Try to listen to them in a good stereo, they have a really good sound. This isn't a parody anymore and I can't understand those who underrate this album because of that, this is a true and original beatles tribute that any beatles fan will appreciate."
2,A Dirk in the lonely heart,"Eric Idle's pre-fab creation, The RUTLES, were an hilarious dead-on knock-off of the Beatles. But that was 1978, and all four Fabs were alive then-- so laughter came easy. This 1990s rip of the ANTHOLOGY specials and CDs is Idle-less, ill-considered and quite unnecessary.The new ""old"" songs here are dismissively mediocre, the three-man-left joke in poor taste, and even the mixes seem wrong: music obscures many vocals to the point where this not only doesn't sound like the Beatles, it ain't the RUTLES, either. Give it a rest Neil-- it's not funny anymore, mate!TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 49:37"
5,This Album Rocks In True West Coast Style!!,"DJ Doran seamlessly mixes 13 feet stomping tracks from the Rampant repertoire. Classic 'West Coast' breakbeats and progressive house from artists such as Ascendance, Mr Funkster, Immigrant & Doc Martin. An excellent taste of the 1994-96 underground scene. Reccomended."
5,The Conquest of Fear (1921),"The author was a cleric who eventually became blind. He wrote fiction stories that had religious themes and plots to them, often cloaking subtle aspects in high mysticism. In THE CONQUEST OF FEAR, King reveals slowly his unfolding religious experience through the years and lays a unique foundation of principles for anyone to refute fear of any kind, anywhere. King writes in a deeply personal way, sharing his experiences and insights, as if with you alone. There is a convincing factor to this book that will help you to rid yourself of fright and dread. It is a highly practical book of spiritual guidance for anyone who is seeking to live life to the fullest."
1,Over priced,"I already own this book, no chance I will pay almost as much for Kindle edition as I would have to pay for another paperback copy, it's all about GREED."
1,ILLOGICAL,"Too shallow, stiff and hokey. No action. No emotion. Blah. The Solarians were too extreme to swallow."
5,Important Reading,I found the story to be a fascinasting account of how one person overcame his fears(personal and those imposed by his society and its customs) to logically solve a very perplexing crime which had galactic ramifications Also a must read is the Robots of Dawn and The Caves of Steel. exceedingly well written!.
3,An enjoyable blend of sci-fi & mystery,"Asimov writes a enjoyable blend of science-fiction and mystery. The pace is leisurely, and the novel might seem almost simplistic by today's sci-fi standards. Once you consider that it was published in 1957, the novel takes on an added dimension (and explains some anachronisms like the frequently exclaimed ""Jehosaphat""). You can see Asimov's very creative mind at work (the crime itself could only be accomplished through science-fiction) and how shows like ""Star Trek"" borrow liberally from his work. Be forewarned that Asimov likes to ponder science-fiction concepts a few pages here and there."
5,A First for Me,"This was my first Asimov book. I thought it was very well written. I wasn't sure what to expect going in because I have heard so much about Isaac Asimov. Naked Sun was very entertaining. I must admit that I was sucked into the whodunnit of the book, however. I was intrigued also by the difference in cultures between the eartman and the spacers. It was interesting to see how they reacted to each other. A book like this parallels todays world in which every city has someone who was not born there, who is a sort of outsider and must adjust to the norms of that society or not adhere and pave a path for him or herself. Naked Sun will definately make me read more of Asimov."
5,very BEST!,"I read this book even before i read the other Robot detective books and i found this book fascinating! Baley's work in this book is quite great and i loved the story as well as the logic shown. After reading this i bought the other robot books and after reading the Caves of Steel I could understand Baley's queer behavior in this book(jush as agrophobia). So I would recommened to read those books in order. the Caves of Steel, the Naked Sun, and the Robots in the Dawn. However the order doesn't really matter. You can enjoy this book without great knowledge about the other Robot books."
4,Detective Elijah Baley investigates the future,"Planet Solaria is rich. Its inhabitantshave every conceivable luxury. They enjoy longlifespans and their every whim is attended toby an army of robots.But it is a society of isolated individuals,who has lost the human tribe, the cooperationbetween humans. And some of the Solarians doesn't seemall that happy after all.Detective Elijah Baley from NYC, womb-city Earth,is send out to investigate a murder on this planet.And while Elijah Baley investigates a murder -we, the readers, investigates various differentfutures for humanity.As always, brilliant classic stuff from Asimov.-Simon"
2,skittish handling & no Mac drivers after OS X 10.4,"I use this tablet to write Chinese characters. Writing them works in Windows 7 Ultimate, after a fashion. So does optical character recognition, after download and installation of the Simplified Chinese Language Pack from the Windows Update Website.However, the handling of the stylus is skittish: it's difficult to draw a straight line or a smooth curve. Yes, I *am* holding the stylus as if it were a Chinese ink brush, but holding it as if it were a pen does not help. After trying for some hours, I've come to the conclusion that I'll do better to use my optical mouse for writing Chinese characters.Actually I'd rather use this tablet under Apple Mac OS X, but the manufacturer KYE (aka Genius) has not written any drivers for OS X since version 10.4. So the tablet is useless under current versions of OS X."
4,Very nicely done!,"If you like British police procedurals, then I highly recommend the Mitchell and Markby series. This is the fifth book in the series, and it has all the things in it that I have come to expect from this author. Ms. Granger is a master craftsman of character design. Her characters are wonderfully real, with just enough eccentricities to make them enjoyable. The plot is also wonderfully intricate and complex. The book explores all sorts of issues such as family values, unhappy marriages, disfunctional families and it does so effortlessly and seamlessly. This book is centered around an archeological dig where modern bodies and ancient bones seem to keep turning up. It's a great puzzle."
5,Very funny and original Indepent type movie :),Although unlikely in some spots the scenario is believable due to the wonderful acting. There are so many funny and unique moments that make this video great. This movie reminds me of Muriel's Wedding because both main characters take a lot of support from their friend/sister. I love this movie!!!
4,Not bad for a Grandmaster......,"As one of Mr. Kasparov's first such ventures, this was one heck of a product. It's best used in a computer v.s a DVD player. I agree with a previous review that the language is a bit tough, but I could appreciate the natural conversation. The games are excellent, but I wished that he had gone into more detail about the decision for some moves. Overall, it's a worth the purchase. I actually obtained this version from the manufacturer, before it was available on Amazon, so the Amazon price is much better. I just wish that Amazon would come thru with #2, that's been on order since January!"
3,Could be better... but nice work,"I believe that this is the first Kasparov's DVD, is far beyon from najdorf DVD.In this DVD has a Earn Value, DAtabase, Cristal Frizt and more, Kasparov was very Historical with the lines, I expected Kasparov lab's, well old lines played in the 90's or 80's... Maybe i prayed for much, but is what the says the box, and the profile product.I am a fan, of Kasparov games and style, i see the DVD, just for see Kasparov, and enjoy the video, Kasparov speaks well, nice explication but honestly i expect for more.I give 3 start because one is for the historical approach of Kasparov speak, and the another for a false profile of the product, gives the idea that Kasparov's LAB are given in the DVD, because of that i was mad with the product. I try to be honest i love the DVD, just for Kasparov.Beginer who love Kasparov games, they will love this product, enjoy it.I try to be honest."
2,Slow,"I bought this game with the intenion of learning some new chess attack techniques but found the tactics too common--not in the specific set of moves, but in how Kasparov executes the moves on the software.Overall, 2 stars."
1,Fire Hazzard Waiting to Happen,This is a fire hazzard waiting to happen. I had it for about 1 1/2 months and I went to go plug it into the wall and it started shooting out lots of sparks. Is there anyway to get amazon to not allow this garbage on amazon?
1,Almost caught my house on fire!,"I bought two of these, one for a Dell Inspiron 6000 and the other for an Inspiron E1505. Both of the cords started to fray almost immediately. I tried taping them with electrical tape, but one of the cords shorted out while my wife was using it. It crackled and popped and almost caught the hardwood floor on fire! When I contacted the company, they sent me two replacement ""High Quality"" power cords which did the same exact thing! Please do not buy this product!"
4,Awesome,"Laptop Adapter for Dell Inspiron E1505I've had the charger for about three weeks and I've had no problems. As long as you unplug your laptop from AC power when it's fully charged, there will be no problems. Good product!"
2,Not what you think it is,A couple of differences between this product and the original Dell product:1. 3 prong instead of original 2 prong connector to the wall plug2. Shorter than original cord and makes it cumbersome to use.I do not recommend this as a replacement A/C adapter for original Dell product.
1,Crap,"I think that 6 months life expectancy is too short, even for the Chinese junk. That is, how long this adapter was working for me before I buried it. The price is good, but I wonder: shall I buy 3 of them to make sure that at least one of them will be OK?"
1,A Waste of Money,"I bought this for an Inspiron E1505, just like advertised. It worked but burned out in a week, what a waste, if you have to buy a new one every two weeks. Dont Buy this charger, it will just burn out on you"
1,Sucks,Not enough voltage for my Dell Inspiron E1505 and my battery is new but it won't charge the battery. Maybe that's why it's so cheap.
3,Dell Adapter,"The adapter did work, but it will not charge the battery. It did state that in the info enclosed with the item. But it was not mentioned in the description when ordering. The item did arrive in a just a few days. Like the service, but a little disappointed in the description. I would order again from this seller"
1,Good for a month.,"I've owned FIVE of these in two years - They keep breaking! Last night my current one burned out so I've had to order another to keep using my laptop.On the Dell website they sell these adapters for $80, $20 is a stretch as is.If you're lucky, the protective wire casing wont split open. The first two I owned died because of the casing splitting open. I've actually learned to reinforce the plug that goes into the laptop with ducktape and toothpicks to keep it stiff. You also have to worry about it randomly burning out or overloading. In which case it'll emit an insanely high beeping noise.11/2/08Update: The cord is shorter then the others I have owned... Either the plug on my laptop is going bad or the adapter is already screwed out of the box. It constantly disconnects putting the laptop on battery. To fix this I have to move the cord around and spin the connecting end in the laptop's port for it to go back to ""On AC Power."""
1,I should have read the reviews.,"Of course when my charger stopped working I scrambled to order another adapter. It didn't even occur to me to read the reviews on Amazon because I just needed to get my precious laptop back.This adapter is terrible. It barely fits into the port, and I actually have to loop the cord over the corner of my laptop to force it to stay in place. Of course, half the time it doesn't stay in place and is constantly pulling out of my laptop. I only bought it a month ago, and yet the wires are already showing as the black cover pulls away from the battery pack (not unsafely). Also, the cord is much, much too short and is constantly pulling out of the wall.Do not buy."
3,Rate the Laptop Adapter for Dell Inspiron E1505,"This product is acceptable for its purpose, but I do not know if it is the laptop adapter or the laptop battery that makes the battery charge for up to two hours at a time. This is the first time I have never been able to be unplugged for two hours or less and it is extremely annoying."
4,The Courage Tree,The Courage Tree was a great example of a mother's love andthat is never ending. It also showed that people are not alwayswhat they appear to be and who you think they are.It was an enjoyable book.
3,Good story with a lot of drama..,"I enjoyed this book and it was a fairly fast read. The characters are interesting and well written but there is definitely a lot of drama in this book with a plot involving illness, a car accident, a missing child, a convict on the loose, etc.I did enjoy this book, but like a few others here, I thought The Secret Life of Cee Cee Wilkes was even better."
2,Not Diane Chamberlain's best effort,I have read all of Diane Chamberlain's books and enjoy them all until this one. It was not horrid but could have been a lot better. I hope that her next book will be better.
2,A Good Read,I'm a middle-aged guy and as such probably not a typical DC fan. But I enjoyed this book.
3,The Courage Tree,"This book had a very predictable ending, just an o.k. read. Diane Chamberlain has done much better work than this."
5,The Courage Tree,"Awesome reading for everyone. Diane Chamberlain keeps you in suspense from beginning to end. The characters she uses are so intertwined that you know in early reading that they will be connecting, but how?? She does it so deliberate and yet you wouldn't even have guessed.I am reading all of Chamberlains books and am almost there, keep writing!!"
3,book,this product came just like described. i was very satisfied with the speed which i received this item. i recommend this to anyone.
3,Interesting but repetitive,"I found this book to be interesting to read during my son's first year of life. I kept reading things and saying, ""Hey, he does that same thing!"" The authors' cutsie attempts at humor grew tiresome after the first quarter of the book and by the end I felt it was just saying the same thing over and over."
2,Hard to find the content.,It seems as though the authors are more interested in name dropping and patting themselves on the back than making the book readable. I found all the outside references distracting and probably unnecessary. Once I was able to get beyond the pandering fluff I found the data interesting and in many cases helpful but it just seemed as though the writers were paying homage to too many outsiders and not enough attention to those of us who bought the book.
4,Excellent and lacking one thing,I am a Montessori teacher. I loved the book because it uses today's technology and research techniques to validate the work done by Dr. Maria Montessori ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO. The only problem with this book is that the authors never mention Dr. Montessori. It's a good read though it's too bad the authors didn't observe Montessori classes.I recommend this book for teachers and especially parents.
2,Dull and not what i expected,"Too much filler, not enough actual content regarding how babies learn and how their brain and minds develop. I found this book boring, repetitive and slow- a real disappointment."
2,Disappointing,"Hugely disappointing book that provides little that is fresh, insightful or frankly interesting. I bought this with such high expectations, but there is nothing here an observant parent wouldn't already know."
2,"Some good stuff, too much fuss","The book contains some interesting information, relevant to the title. Unfortunately it is very very repetitive. I found myself saying ""I can't believe it is telling this again"" many times.Having said that, there are some good parts in chapter 2 and 3 that are worth reading. The introduction and chapter 4-7 are a complete waste of paper, as the 50-page-long notes and reference (who reads them nowadays? put them up on a web site if someone wants to dig deeper). I would have preferred paying the same price for a 60-page-book with the same content, but I guess the markets impose some rules in order to be able to sell..."
4,Amazing scientific study of what babies know and learn,"This is a fascinating report of research studies that compare the mind of a baby to a computer. The brain is programmed to receive and sort out information from all the senses and to use input from adults and kids to change the program as learning provides new experiences. The authors have done their own research and reviewed other studies about babies and toddlers to back up their analyses of infant learning. Parents and grandparents will be fascinated as they compare the development of young children in their families to the explanations of the infants' ""scientific"" explorations, classifications, and language learning. You'll find out why everyone talks ""motherese"" to babies. You'll realize that the kid in the crib is not just lying there waiting for the next diaper or bottle, but is very busy indeed figuring out the world and how it works. A truly fascinating book!"
3,Outdated,"This book is fine but outdated. Recommend ""What's going on in there?"" instead, as it's much more informative and current."
4,Technical but informative,"Not written to entertain but to help explain their research into the thoughts of babies and how they learn. Example: Follows their experiment on babies and foreign languages, even though these children can't talk yet!"
3,Babies ready to speak any language,"This book wasn't as interesting as I hoped it would be, but I loved the chapter on language. It was fascinating to read that when babies initially begin to babble, they are able to differentiate all spoken sounds. Then the culture they are living in exerts its influence.""Once babies reach the babbling milestone, the universal phase of language production ends. Babies from different cultures, learning different languages, start to make the distinctive noises of their own community sometime between a year and a year and a half. The Chinese baby starts to babble in a way that sounds Chinese. She uses very rapid pitch changes just like adult Chinese speakers. Swedish babies babble in a way that sounds distinctly Swedish, using the rising intonation patterns typical of adult speakers of Swedish.""The research described in this book gave good reasons why I am constantly amazed every time I spend time with my grandsons."
1,Best thing ever,"Oh I just creamed my pants at the very mention of the two God like words Led Zeppelin. This is a work not of humans, but GODS. Zeppelin is God. Everyone should bow down before these mega beings and thank themselves lucky that Led Zeppelin think we are worthy enough to be within a million miles of their glorious presence."
1,SO OVERRATED IT LEAVES ME DAZED AND CONFUSED,"LED ZEPPELIN ARE OVERRATED GARBAGE! .This album stinks from start to finish just like the 30 year old corpse that Led Zeppelin are.Yes I do like Heavy /hard rock but this album , like any other album of ""Zep""'s is so lame it makes me want to laugh. How can so many people be hoodwinked for so long into thinking this 'band' are good?Also, some of the songs that are credited to them are really just old blues songs that they sneakily 'borrowed'."
1,Buy Guns N' Roses Greatest Hits Insted,"No good songs on this CD, Led Zeppelin sucks, probably the onlygood song is Communication Breakdown from the Glory Days show.Plus Guns N' Roses rock and they did a greater album than theseloosers, Greatest Hits. Buy it insted of this at a cheap price."
1,Audio excrement,"You Americans have made yourselves the laughing stock of the world by describing everything as ""awesome"", ""cool"", and ""gnarly"". And ,oh yes , I think that Led Zeppelin are the most overarted band of all time , even more than u2 and Pink Floyd."
1,why everyone say's it awesome,"the way everyone say its awesome because, they don't really say that there music is good. they just find good sounding things about the song. Like if i said babe i'm gonna leave you has a great acoustic tune then it goes into a fast heavy metal tune. There not saying its a good. It really a boring song. and having the album go really high on the charts also gives them another excuse. i hope that cleared you up."
1,"LED ZEPPELIN: HORRIBLE, DIRE STRAITS IS GOD","What can I SAY???? To the most overrated and horrible bands everto come out of the 60s, Led Zeppelin. They sure never made anything decent. They are overrated. Stay away from this junkmasterpiece along with all the other Led Zeppelin.Dire Straits is god and will always be!! Don't say anythingabout Green Day either. They are overrated.BYE BYE LOVE,ENTER SANDMAN."
3,ENTERTAINING-Blues covers album?!:-) - CLASSIC Zepp?!,"Yeah, that's right I think this is a cover's album. It's entertaining, but you've heard it on the radio before. It's highly creative mood music, but it sound's like some traditional blues material...It's that new heavy music, but hippies are outdated and hair metal went out-of-style in the late '80s. So just put this album on and pretend it's the Strokes or the Hives. Forget about Page and Plant in their hippie costumes and customs. Just pretend it's the latest 'cool band' ripping off some band from the '60s or '70s- thinking that given 'cool band' is the first to do something 'cool!' Either way- check this out and Jeff Beck's ""Truth"" album and anything by the Yardbirds to give a clue as to what this historic album is all about. Still has it's moments, despite being open to nit-picking."
4,Great Debut,"There have been stronger debut albums put out, such as Prounced Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd and Are You Experienced, but no band in history rose to the top of the music industry faster than Zeppelin. Their rise to glory came right in the middle of two of rock and roll's most significant events. 1. The break-up of the Beatles. 2. The emergence of the Rolling Stones as the greatest rock and roll band the world has ever known. In 1968, The Beatles were the No. 1 band in the world and the Stones were No. 2. 1969 was the year of transformation. The Beatles would break up but the Stones surpassed them even before that happened. As the Beatles ceased to exist, Zeppelin moved into the No. 2 spot.All that said, You Shook Me, Good Times Bad Times, and Dazed and Confused are real good songs, the rest of the album isn't bad either. Good work by LZ."
5,One of The Best Debuts Ever,"This is one of the best debut albums ever released, on par with Are You Experienced?, Blizzard of Oz, Texas Flood, and the like. Indeed, nearly every song is great. Dazed and Confused is the great ""layered"" complex kind of song that would find full flower on later Zep albums like Physical Graffiti and Presence. Good Times, Bad Times is a simple but enjoyable straight-ahead rocker. I Can't Quit You Baby and You Shook Me are great versions of blues standards. Babe I'm Gonna Leave You is great too. Hell, everything is. Buy it."
5,One of those moments!,"Now, if I'd only been born earlier so I could hear and see LZ play live. I wasn't so I couldn't and hearing these fantastic recordings doesn't make the thought easier. - This is a must have for everyone with their hearing working and their heart in the right place."
5,One of the greatest debut albums,"Led zeppelin's debut is one of the best after the debut of black sabbath.This terrific album contains excellent songs like good times bad times,your time is gonna come and dazed and confused.very highly recommended."
5,Led Leppelin I,"My God. It's almost funny, reading the one and two star reviews of people who are two young to have enjoyed the R'N'R years as they unfolded; are too opionated and pretentious to see the historic and atistic value; or are too presumptious to allow others their personal opinions.Led Zeppelin stole from the blues? It's a matter of semantics, right? They weren't alone. Clapton. Beck. Peter Green. Marriot. Etc. etc. So many great players and bands took their inspiration from the blues. Next thing we know, there will be hordes of nincompoops saying how bad Hendrix was.The first Zeppelin album is great in context, and offers a good deal of fine listening for anyone who enjoys old rock. It could justifiable be someones favorite Zeppelin album, based on their personal taste."
4,VERY GOOD FIRST ALBUM,"A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYYHING ON THIS ALBUM.JIMMY PAGE WASDEFINATELY AHEAD OF HIS TIMEJAMMING OUT ON COMMUNICATIONBREAKDOWN,AND DAZED AND CONFUSED!BUT I DO LIKE ZEPPELIN 2 BETTER."
5,A Wonderful Showcase of talents!,"Led Zeppelin's first album is probably one of the greatest albums of all time. Though this is an early release for them, it really shows their flourishing talents. It also gives you a groovin' blues-rock style of Led Zeppelin that is very lovable. This style became less apparent on their later albums as the group's interests became different and diverse, but overall it's a definite wonderful listen for anybody."
5,I'm having a nervous breakdown!,"Led Zeppelin's first album was a hell of an impressive debut. I think it's safe to say that the world had never heard anything like it before. It's complex, subtle, idiosyncratic and visionary. Just listen to the acoustic grace of ""Babe I'm Gonna Leave You"", the heaving inevitability of ""Communication Breakdown"", the enveloping roar of Robert Plant's vocals on ""Dazed and Confused"" and the pop flavoring of ""Your Time is Gonna Come"". This is a great album that presaged a lot of the hard rock music of the '70s, and I highly recommend it."
5,Great Service,As a hard core and long time Zeppelin fan there is nothing i can say about the album that hasnt already been said. I bought it to complete my collection again(funny how things go missing when your an old fart)It arrived well within the time frame i was given and was in Perfect condition.
5,the mighty zep,"Where it all started,every band that has come since was influenced by this and the first Black Sabbath album.From the start led zeppelin were always committed to their craft, pushing musical boundaries and not conforming to the norm. Led Zeppelin is their debut record and it is relentless from start to finish. Occasionally they ripped off old blues artists, sometimes without according the proper acknowledgement, but they always made the songs their own in terms of style. The old blues players never sounded half as fierce as Zeppelin did on ""You Shook Me"" or ""I cant quit you"". Led Zeppelin I is the band's most blues based recording. Bonham's drums thunder, Page's guitar pierces and plant howls like only he can. If you are interested in listening to one of the most influential rock bands of all time then this is as good a place as any to begin"
3,Steal Away,"Despite the awkward attempt at a hit single with the opening ""Good Times Bad Times,"" LED ZEPPELIN is an impressive recreation of the stage show the band, which had morphed from the New Yardbirds to Led Zeppelin only months earlier, was riding through Europe.Highlights include a sizzling version of ""You Shook Me,"" a dazzling guitar solo on ""Dazed And Confused,"" a nearly punkish ""Communications Breakdown,"" and the absolute blitzkreig of ""How Many More Times.""What set LED ZEPPELIN and, for that matter, Led Zeppelin, apart from a whole host of British blues LPs and bands in 1969 was Jimmy Page's production and, to a lesser extent, his guitar playing. Both are operating at peak levels on the band's first LP."
2,BEWARE: Lesser Quality Argentinian Import!,"My review is 2 stars for the distributor and product (I would give 4 stars were I to review the album). The reason that these Zeppelin remasters are being sold so relativly cheap on Amazon is because the seller, MusicStore2000, is selling lesser quality imports from Argentina. First off, 2 of the 3 cases I ordered from this seller arrived broken and cracked (a real pet peeve of mine). As for the disc itself, the printing on the actual disc is kinda sloppy. The disc appears to be of lower quality than the other Zep remasters I already own. The sound quality is acceptable...I do think the disc does contain the '94 remaster. Overall, I would say this disc is on par with the ones you get from those 12-for-a-penny record clubs...slightly inferior to the store bought versions. What bothers me the most, though, is that nowhere on the Amazon sales page does it say you are getting Argentinian imports. I would not have bought them had I known ahead of time."
1,Oh brother!!!,"I sucked into buying too many CD by man at work who say they really good. Each one I listen to too many time and none good, this one too! Man who sing the song sound like a woman, like a woman feeling painful. And too much scream and yelling. Wish I could take back. My english not so good but my music taste very good and know this CD not so great! Songs all sound like same too. Just scream and yell, loud guitar, too much noise. Not good!"
1,crap,"this cd is responsible for all the [...]thats being called music. if you want music im going to say this again buy good charlotte they my friend are true musicians NO i am not joking! i swear led zeppelin, black sabbath all of those bands are posers they just tried to start new trends and fads. good charlotte didnt need to start anything they are and always will be part of the trends. do you see led zeppelin on mtv, i dont think so because in order for someone to be a good musician they have to be sponsored on mtv.AIM screen name: yoohooscoobydoo"
1,LED ZEPPELIN ARE POSERS,"Hey come on now, how come Led Zeppelin are so popular because I hate them. All these people want me to listen to them but why? Led Zeppelin are just a bunch of posers.First of all Led Zeppelin are the most overrated band ever.I hear them on every radio station.The lead singer Robert Plant can't sing, he just screams and he sounds like a crying babyThis isn't music..this is just noise.It is garbage music.Foreigner's 4 album is miles better than this.Don't buy this album.Destroy."
1,MOST BORING BAND IN HISTORY,"Led Zeppelin ARE AMONGST ONE OF THE WORST BANDS IN HISTORY. THE SINGER SCREAMS AND THIS CONTAINS AWFUL SONGS LIKE YOU SHOOK ME.THEY ONLY MADE 2 DECENT SONGS IN STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, AND KASHMIR.Get NIRVANA, GREEN DAY, DIRE STRAITS, AND GUNS AND ROSES INSTED.DON'T LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE LED ZEPPELIN. THEY ARE JUSTAS BAD AS THE ROLLING STONES, BEATLES, & WHO.EXPRESSO LOVE."
3,Zeppelin's Led,"This album is good if you're into the blues thing (zzzzzz) and you're into the anti-woman lyrics. But as the years have gone by, these songs just don't move me, nor do they keep me interested musically. But I will say it has great fidelity. I only wish ""Deep Purple's in Rock"" had this kind of sound quality. Drummer John Bohnam is a bit too ""bam bam"" for my tastes, but the singer Robert Plant never sounded so good. It must have been before all the touring.Highlights: Good Times, Bad Times & Communication Breakdown"
3,acceptable!,"This album has also belonged to the rock history. Black mountain side is excellent.PS: Though Deep Purple's album ""IN ROCK"" is much better & Heavier than this one, my humble opinion."
2,I don't like this cd very much,"This cd is the worst of the Led Zeppelin. I really hate the boring covers of ""Shook Me"" and ""I Can't Quit You Baby"". Also ""How Many More Times"" is repetitive and meaningless. The lyrics are very stupid in this one. The only track that I enjoy is ""Your Time Is Gonna Come"" and (a little) ""Babe I'm Gonna Leave You"". I don't understand why the most enjoy very much Led Zeppelin. Awful blues guitar rock. Only ""Stairway To Heaven"" (found in L.Z. IV) is an excellent song. Go listen to Pink Floyd or Alan Parsons."
5,"Good times, good times","The CD has the time-honored Atlantic label printed on it and the sound is great. Oh yeah, and it's Zep."
5,IT SHOOK ME UNTIL I WAS DAZED & CONFUSED!,The second best album done by the Zep. The best songs are probably You Shook Me and Dazed & Confused. Many blues with some rock'n'roll. Excellent Bass in most songs by Jones and of course excellent lead by Page. These songs are deep and can really move you! Probably the best album lyricwise. Dazed &Confused is probably the second best song ever done by Zeppelin next to Stairway to Heaven. Easily best overall albulm next to numberIV. Songs are easy to learn as far as music and are fun to play. They mix in the keyboard and the harmonica quite well. Very relaxing and easy to listen to.
5,the first one,this is from which it started! they asked my husband's help and he helped them! the lyrics are very good! the riffs are very good! i love Jimmy Page's guitar work! and plant's vocals! they made great work!
5,Amazing,"Simply amazing how a band that had been together such a short time could produce such a fantastic album. Besides being a great album the first Led Zeppelin album laid the foundation for hard rock, and there is nothing like the original even though this album is over thirty years old it can still put any modern ""hard rock"" band to shame."
5,Excellent debut,"You cannot come to an appreciation of this record until you listen to everything else that was out in January 1969. (The same can be said of Van Halen's debut.) Nobody (including the much-lauded Cream) had defined power-blues more . . . well, definitively . . . as this record does. It is hard to believe that this collaboration of two accomplished studio musicians (Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones) and two newcomers (Robert Plant, John Bonham) who had picked up the touring dates of the old Yardbirds could have this much chemistry. With covers of two blues classics (""I Can't Quit You Babe"" and ""You Shook Me""), LZ stayed close to its roots while still shaking things up with a litte bit of folk (""Babe I'm Gonna Leave You""), a little bit of rock (""Communications Breakdown""), and a little bit of psycadelia (""Dazed and Confused""). Overall, a sonic assault on the senses."
2,Other bands better,"Please, is just me , or Led Zeplin not so good? I have hear some of good songs their, but rest not so good."
2,They call this one of the greatest debuts,"We need to have less of these pompous journo's around who inflate the importance of the bands they grew up with or for which they copied other journo's reviews of. Initially you might listen to Dazed, babe and a few others a bit, but the whole thing wears out quite soon. It's popular today because of hype and nostalgia. Case in point: Even Green Day are considered classic and legendary today despite being the amateur pop garage band they still are and were when they came out with Dookie in 1994. Anything can be popular and the more accessible or journo-defined cool it is the more it 'endures.'Incidentally, the best debut of all time is Iron Maiden's self-titled."
2,Tolerable,"Along with Physical Graffiti, this is the only tolerable one of Led Zeppelin's albums. I have nothing against the fact that quite a few of the songs on this album are covers of blues standards; they are performed fairly competently. I would strongly recommend listening to the originals over the Zeppelin covers though, especially the Willie Dixon numbers (Zep have no hope of holding a candle to these). Also recommended: skip 'How Many More Times' and 'Dazed and Confused'."
2,Well Overrated,"I've never understood what people saw in this band. No real melody, loud drums, gimmicks galore, etc. The Beatles, Stones, Who were much better."
1,A disgrace,Led Zeppelin butchered the blues on this album. They use these classic songs as a vehicle to propell them to commercial success. This sad mockery of the blues basically signifies what Zepp was all about - making trivial music.
1,I hate Led Zeppelin,"Led Zeppelin were a mediocre band at best, but their fans have got to be the most obnoxious people in the world. According to these fans ""Zep"" were supernatural beings, every other band is garbage, and every song that any other hard rock band wrote sounds exactly like Whole Lotta Love or Kashmir, .Well let me say that Led Zeppelin copied the Who,Cream, Blue Cheer, and old blues like Muddy Waters."
5,Zeppelin in the air,"I was visiting with my cousin up in San Jose when i first heard this.We were heading down to Carmel, he was 17 I was about 10 years old and i was raving about how great 3 Dog Night were when he reached down and grabbed this pink and black 8track tape and put it in his Craig Player.He looks at me and says this is what real music sounds like you little dweeb.I hated him sometimes but damn if this wasnt the coolest music i ever heard.Its still my favorite of all the Zep catalogue.I love that stuff too but this will always be my fave.I still like 3 dog night too.Screw you big cousin but thanks for turning me on to the Zep!"
5,just listen,"robert plant one of the greatest vocalists EVERjimmy page is completely insane at guitarjohn paul jones is great at bass and keyboardsjohn bonham is arguably the best drummer of the eraput those 4 things together and how can you go wrong? the album is an absolute classic. early zeppelin is the best too, before they really got into the synthesized crap that you'll hear on houses of the holy and later albums(though those albums are good as well). this is just pure musical talent at it's best."
5,The Zeppelin,I absoutly love and admire Led Zeppelin. Musical geniuses. I just want to point out to the people that who don't like legends like zeppelin and the who that some of your fav. bands..have covered their material. To respect the present and future of music...you have to learn to respect the past.
1,Remaster butchery,"I bought the disc and was extremely bummed to find that the ""ghost track"" on _Babe I'm Gonna Leave You_ had been mixed out. Listen for this haunting and weird track on your pre-remix version: right before Plant sings ""I can hear it calling me"" the first time. You can hear it calling him. I rate the disc low for this alone."
2,Heard it all before,"I thought this album sounded familiar the first time I heard it. Then I realized that I had heard it before, when it was released (six months earlier) under the title TRUTH, by the JEFF BECK GROUP.Boring and derivative. Robert Plant should have served 10 years in prison for impersonating a harp player on that dismal solo in ""You Shook Me."""
4,greatest drummer ever . whatever.,"led zep is good. but come on there all like what like what 20 years older than ac/dc vanhalen, and so many others. led zep was always my favorite growing up. but after awhile i grew into more modern stuff. you can't live in the past people. any band that can't entertaining should just get out of the biz. face it people led zep is done. their is no more. i loved jason bonham but they think its nepotizm that got him in the buz. be hes got the chops so cut him a break."
3,A decent offering...,"My brother, a Led Zeppelin fanatic, owns this album, and I have heard him play it again and again. Frankly, I don't see what's so great about it other than song number nine, which is great and musically impressive...at least until Plant starts singing. I personally consider him one of the worst rock 'n' roll singers of all time -- right up there with Brian Johnson and that guy from Cinderella. If you kids want to hear REAL singing -- and real heavy metal -- try bands such as Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, and Deep Purple. By the way, does anyone else think that this album has one of the ugliest cover images of all time?"
5,The Lords of Rock,"Or should of say the fathers of metal. I do get tired of hearing people say particularly on this site that Black Sabbath started heavy metal. Don't get me wrong I love Black Sabbath, they are awesome, but they didn't start jack. Now compared to now, zep isn't near metal, but then it definately was. And whats up with "" to hell with rock"" dude what an idiot. I hate people that don't know what the heck they are talking about. Your probably some young punk that watches way to muck MTV, which is a crappy station anyway. Led Zep broke up in 1980 because of the death of the greastest drummer in rock histroy John Bohnom. Thats why they ain't on MTV stupid. Anyway this album is great all the songs Rock!!!! You have to be into it though, if your a Korn lover or anything new and you start to listen to it, you probably wont like it."
5,"great album, no matter what classic hatin snobs say","This is a great album, has many songs on it that should be played everyday on the radio up till today. I recommend it to people who have listened to other classic great bands and like what they here. Also if you like blues this is a good one. As for what Mr. Hat said, he has no f***ing idea what he's talking about. NFG is a queer band that sings for little kids. This is deep music that anybody whos anybody would like... unless you dont like rock or blues"
4,"A great album, but the best was yet to come","This was their first album, you can't ask for perfection the first time around. It is a fine effort that contains several classic cuts, notably ""Your Time Is Gonna Come,"" ""I Can't Quit You Baby,"" ""You Shook Me,"" and ""How Many More Times."" With the exception of the boring ""Babe I'm Gonna Leave You,"" this is a solid album. Live versions of several of the songs from the Royal Albert Hall 1/9/70 (disc one of the DVD set) are more energetic than the studio versions (blow them out of the water, in fact). Overall, this is worthy of purchasing, but it would probably be best to start your collection (if you haven't already) with II or IV. This is probably their fourth or fifth best album."
5,Army daze,"After Vietnam, my first duty station was Ft. Sill, Oklahoma; 1969.Ah, the encounters, foul ups, and idiotic decisions I made there. This wonderful album was such a part of that."
5,led zeppelin's debut,"As a debut album, this is far better than most bands ever put out. For Led Zeppelin, this is an okay album - not their best, but still good. My favorite song on this album is Babe I'm Gonna Leave You. Led Zeppelin is one of the only bands I can never get tired of listening to. If you own any of their albums and are trying to decide if you should get this one, then please decide to buy this album - that is what you should do. If you don't own any Led Zeppelin albums then get Led Zeppelin II and/or Houses of the Holy."
5,Grit,"Gritty, raunchy, dirty, provocative - this is not classic rock. Its simply Rock, at its most expressive! Sly, raubunctous and moody, with a sensitivity to texture which makes you appreciate why Zeppelin is the most copied band in history. Many have tried to imitate what seems to be imitable - the groove/beat/smirk ; but genius only seems easy to those who create it."
3,Noise: The enemy of next generation,"Pollution is an overgrowing environmental nuisance, and noise pollution is intruding life in every house of today's big cities. There are several ways to confront noise pollution, like physical means, legal ways, or educational efforts. This book deals with noise pollution by teaching children how it is caused and created, how it affects people and how it can be blocked and reduced. It also makes them aware to the damage it may cause to any human being. In simple language, large fonts and nice pictures, fact by fact, this book tells the nature of noise, how it is caused, and the ways to fight it. Children, as we all know, are tomorrow's citizens, and should better be ready to eliminate the growing levels of pollution by every means, like reading such book. It is highly recommended to every school library in the western world's big cities."
1,NOT WORTH IT!!!!,"Maybe I should've read the review for this book, but when I did, it really wasn't that helpful. This book is only 30 pages. Yes, the fonts are large. That's because it's geared for kids reading in the 2nd grade. This is not a technical book, which is what I expected. The rating for this book should be marked ""K"" for Kindegarten. NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!"
2,Overpriced and over-hyped,"Had our builder install this in our guest home six years ago and now the plastic washer and o-ring inside have failed causing it to freeze up. We cannot move the faucet from side to side even using considerable force. I called Kohler to have it replaced under their lifetime warranty and instead of replacing the faucet, they took over a month to send the two parts which will supposedly fix it. And, I have to do it myself unless I want to pay a plumber $100 to do it. Plus, there are no assembly or disassembly instructions posted on the site so I had to call Kohler and have a phone tech try to explain how to disassemble this over the phone. Fair service at best. Next time buy Moen!"
3,pretty good faucet,We installed the faucet 4 years ago and it has worked perfectly. My only complaint is the rubber toggle switch (it switches the flow between spray and stream) cracked and is ugly now. So far it seems that can't be replaced by itself you have to buy a whole new handle. A $1 part will cost $40 to fix....not cool.
1,not impressed,Worn toggle on top after one year. Handle broke at 18 mths. Kohler is sending replacement but will be 7-10 days with no water in the kitchen . Second kohler to go bad in 5 years. For over $200 you would think they could make it out of metal not plastic!
2,Kaohler Fairfax - Nice looks - Impossible to repair via Kohler website,"Try seeing an exploded view of the sprayer and you'll see the image in a partial view. When you can finally work thru their idiotic website you see the exploded view cannot be adjusted to see ALL the component parts, hence, making it impossible to view the needed parts much less be able to order them. Do they really think we'll just give up and buy a new one of their over priced faucets instead?Not me, I'll go back to a cheaper Delta or whatever....It'll last longer and if I can't get parts it won't cost over $300 to replace again, after only 2 years yet!!!"
1,made of plastic,"This faucet got hung up and wouldn't swivel easily (grime in the base). I turned the faucet from the left sink to the right it snapped off at the base. Beneath the stainless steel outside, the structure of the faucet is plastic and that's what snapped. The stainless metal outside is just a facade and isn't structural.Why can't someone make a solid metal faucet that will last as long as the house? Kohler once meant quality. Not any more. Will never buy Kohler again."
1,"Less than a year later, leaks","As others have written here...started leaking after less than a year. The cost to fix a small, but inadequately designed part costs more than the faucet."
1,They don't make them like they used to.,"Our Kohler faucet is only 4 years old and the O-ring has failed. Like one of the other reviewers mentioned, the faucet will not turn from side to side when this occurs. Kohler sent us the replacement parts and an e-mail with step-by-step instructions and photos. Unfortunately, the body will not disassemble and the faucet will have to be replaced. Kohler is closed for the weekend and I'm not sure whether I will waste my time installing another Kohler or replace it with a more reliable brand. Very disappointed."
2,Problems w/ Kohler Fairfax Faucet,"I purchased this faucet back in 2002. The looks of the unit are great (w/ have the brushed nickel faucet.) However, as similar reviews have indicated, the quality of this unit is fair at best. We have taken full advantage of their lifetime warranty repair service. We have replaced the faucet handle three times, and now the base of the faucet has locked in place (it will not swivel from left to right any longer.) At this point, I have asked them to send me a brand new one as I am sick of refurbishing the old unit.If I new what a pain this faucet was and had to replace it every three years, I would have not purchased it."
2,Bold look is all there is.,"Had the house built with Fairfax faucets in the polished Nickel throughout. And we have had trouble in several places. The latest is this faucet. After three different people pulled the faucet apart (me, a friend and a plumber) and put it back together, it's still leaking. Changed the O-ring, the cartridge, cleaned the contact gaskets. Called the company and they're sending out a ""spacer kit"" which will supposedly solve the problem. Except it's out of stock--at Kohler. I might get it in two weeks. After another service call, I'll be out of 140 bucks, and no guarantees it'll work. Of course, I can try to fix it myself. At least I would not have dented up the metal pull-out hose by trying to pull out the faucet while the hose was still threaded through it, like the plumber did and put two nice dents in the hose. Honestly. Why can't things be made to last like they used to? Kohler is all about the look, but I've been disappointed in the quality."
3,Nice Pendant,The pendant is nice but the chain isn't very durable. I will wear the pendant with another chain to decrease the chance of breakage and loss.
3,BEST REMIXES includes two of her really big hits (remixed).,"The main reason I purchased the CD was for ""Good Enough"" -- the theme from The Goonies. Until this disc, it has been unavailable. Although it is a remix, it is pretty close to the original, mainly just extended with a few minor changes. Some of the other highlights include extended mixes of ""Girls Just Want To Have Fun"" and ""She Bop."" There is also a live version of ""Money Changes Everything"" and club mixes of ""Change of Heart"" and ""What's Going On,"" making a total of 6 tracks."
3,Japanese import worth having for fans,"Although a dance mix of ""Goonies 'R Good Enough"" might sound like torture to some, it's very well done here and will delight Cyndi Lauper fans. The extended ""Girls Just Wanna..."" & the live ""Money Changes Everything"" are worth having, and ""She Bop"" gets a decent remix. Only the lackluster ""Change of Heart"" and the bland ""What's Going On"" stymie this package, which features one great photograph of Cyndi in all her late-'80's, cartoon-chic glory. B-"
4,Does the trick,"I bought a fish tank set up second hand, and it included two Aquaclear filters. The Aquaclear 70 filter I received was missing it's levelling device and without it, I was just trying random things to keep it level. It would work for a few days and then eventually get loud as it went off-level.I ordered this part as an Add-on and my only regret is that I didn't order a few more at the same time just for back up. Because my filter is older, I did have some difficulty fully inserting the device into the hole in the bottom of the filter, I couldn't get it all the way in due to both a slightly different design than the older model device that was originally on my filter, and because the original owner had tried to super glue the original levelling device back into place, leaving a glue residue that is preventing me from fully installing it.Works as it's designed and my filter is quiet & level now."
4,"great game, bad reviews by uneducated people","This game runs fine on XP, in fact it will run the best on XP.This game will not function properly on intergrated or lower end video cards. this is stated in other words, under the system requirements. It needs a 3D dx 8.1 video card or higher. Lower end Intergrated video cards DO NOT HAVE 3D capabilities. thus giving errors when trying to run the game.-When purchasing this game please be aware of the system requirments and be sure to check your video card capabilities."
1,It Only Works For a Little While,"This game only worked for a couple of months. Then, it informed us that it had something wrong with it. We hit the email problem button, but heard nothing back. We tried to re-install it. It refused to re-install. I feel cheated that I spent money on this game that only worked for a couple of months and then has stopped for good. C. White"
2,Mahjongg tile game,"This particular game turned out to be bit of a let down. The problem with this game [for me anyway] is that the graphics have a point of view like you're sitting at a table rather than a top down view. definitely detracts from the game play. strike two is that the tiles are so big you have to scroll left,right,up, and down to see the whole table. it would be better to simply have smaller tiles seen all at once [in my opinion]I have a game from 1997 called ""Shanghai II"" that is more enjoyable for it's simplistic game play."
1,Disappointing,Thetitle lead me to believe that it was a progressive game that would lead through time as you completed different levels... It doesn't!
1,Difficult Game,This game is one of the most difficult to manouver through and does not let you do much adaptation in playing. I prefer to be able to do some selection in types of patterns. This game says 110 Game Variations. If so I got tricked as it is very difficult to get anywhere and not much fun.
2,Not for Mahjongg players,"Have trouble navigating thru the different games. I just wanted a simple game of Mahjongg, instead I get this. Do not like the product at all."
3,Quit teasing us,"Chris Ayres teases a lot. It seemed that nearly every chapter ended with a teasing line that never materialized, which caused a big let down when the final climactic moment happened. I appreciate how Chris Ayres keeps his readers in suspense and turning the page, but his approach also created an expectation that the ending was going to be the greatest I'd ever read. Naturally, when that didn't happen I was disappointed. His transformation from a high-maintenance primped and preened L.A. suburbanite to a dirty, jaded, frightened out-of-his-mind, admirer of the common soldier seemed genuine and refreshing, but he kept me waiting for something grand to happen that didn't. The promise of gonzo journalism on the back cover also never materialized, which was disappointing for a fan of the late Hunter Thompson. Overall it's a good read, especially if you're not familiar with the military culture, but I expected more."
4,9 Days in Iraq,An insightful account of a journalist embedded with US Marines on the front lines of the Irag war. It stands out from other books on the subject because the journalist is not a gun-ho war correspondent and therefore offers sometimes amusing accounts of his predicament of not really wanting to be on the front lines taking gunfire with his Marine hosts.
4,"Enjoyable, funny, fast reading, informative","I enjoyed reading this book. It reminds me in some way of ""A Walk in the Woods"" by Bill Bryson. Recommended!"
4,1 of their 2 great albums,"A Certain Ratio's first album, ""To Each,"" features the gloom of Joy Division with a ganky funk foundation. An excellent record, quite unlike anything else at the time. ""Sextet"" embraces a cleaner sound and a much wider musical canvas, with some strong melodies (the wonderful ""Lucinda""), quirky funk (""Gum""), extended rhythm experiments, and the wonderful creepiness of ""Knife Slits Water."" The album has a couple of throwaways, but so does ""To Each."" Together, these two albums comprise the bulk of what made ACR significant and compelling circa 1980. They soon lost their way, turning into a pedestrian funk band with the next album (""Can I See You Tonite?""). This cd reissue includes a remix single that sits more comfortably with that latter album. A better choice for ""Sextet"" bonus tracks would have been a 12"" the band released under the name Sir Horatio."
3,Misleading Photo,"I think the title of this panda should be changed, because it misleads one to think it has the bamboo shown here. The image displayed is very cute, and I was expecting this adorable panda to be shipped to me. However, the panda does not come with the bamboo in it's mouth, as the photo shows. I returned the item assuming that the original was a fluke and was missing the bamboo; only to receive the same exact one in return. I purchased this particular one to match a bedding decor with panda and bamboo, but I was quite dissatisfied. I will however keep the panda, and find my own bamboo to suffice."
3,this movie was ok but it could have better.,"This movie didn't give you a good time frame of how long it took everything to happen. When kalla went to New York it was like she automaticly made a cd in a few days. I know it takes longer than that to make the cd, make sure its the sound you want and to shoot the videos. They should've let you know how lnog this entire process took. it seemed like it was only a week may be two. They could have flashed a month later or 3 months later or something on the screen to let you know what kind of time frame this was happening in."
2,Screenwriter should never touch another script again,"I've always respected Diana as an actress and the same respect goes to Brandy as well. This movie was the pits and I was sorry that these two talented ladies were wasted in it! Not only does it have the most tired, overdone plots in film history, but it had the most tired scripts I have heard since Poetic Justice. The extra star is only because of their stage performances. It should have been a VH1 ""Diva"" special instead."
1,...,.... there is one funny line in the thing when that little twit brandy and miss ross are eating together at some restuarant and brandy says does it bother you when other people stare? ross says im used to it it only bothers me when im tired. ha ha ha. ... the plot is so ... to and the twists are so predictable. ...
2,Where Did Our Love Go?,Diana Ross cries better than anyone on screen but tears won't save this lightweight tearjerker where Diana more or less plays herself...The Boss Miss Ross...BUT still this is a must see/must have movie for Ross fans since the former Supreme has only made 3 films and 2 tv movies to date despite her superior acting talent. Colored girls have a hard way to go in Hollywood...and everywhere else it seems. Is this the last film of her career? There aren't many starring roles for aging black actresses in Hollywood and we know Miss Ross has to be the star that glitters and outshines all the rest. Speaking of aging black actresses..whatever happened to Oscar-winning Halle Berry?
5,double platinum,i thought that movie was great to me and wonderful to and there singing as well love very much too.
2,Disappointed,I really like this movie back in the day when it was a TV movie so I was excited to get it and watch if. I thought it was so boring watching it as an adult and am disappointed that I purchased it.
1,Not widescreen,Double Platinum was filmed in Widescreen even though it was a made for tv movie. the region 2 PAL dvd in the UK is Widescreen. Re-release this dvd in widescreen
5,Double Platinum,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Double Platinum was heartwarming as well as inspiring. Diana Ross is truly the consummate diva. She captures your attention whenever she walks out on a stage. The music made me cry, dance, think, and it made me want to sing. Yes, I ordered the CD, Every Day is a New Day! I have worn the grooves out of the CD and watched the movie three times. The duet with Diana Ross and Brandy was one of the highlights of the movie.I hope you will enjoy it as much as I have."
4,WONDERFUL !!!!!!! **** Two Thumbs Up!!,"I thought the movie was beautifully rendendered. This movie focused on many issues that are present in today's society as far as the family structure is concerned. It also focused on issues that some people face when they must choose between family life or fame. As we all know, relationships between parents and children can become strained due to the work environment, stardom and etc. However, I also feel the movie was rushed just a bit. It jumped from one timeframe to another with little indication of what was going on or how the movie proceeded to the next step. The movie crew should have focused more on past timeframes: how did Kayla grow up...what did her mother do to silence her ""demons"" for leaving her baby...what was it like for Kayla's dad....when did Kayla realize she was musically inclined....etc. Overall, the movie was fantastic and touching. Ms. Ross, Brandy, keep up the good work!"
5,"GP from Athens,Ga. Great Movie","I love this movie. Diana and Brandy works good together. "" WE MISS YOU DIANA"""
3,"Thought provoking, even with Og's ego streaming throughout.","I must admit, I was a bit put off by the self-applauding Mr. Og does in this book. However, I did enjoy the read. And I look forward to reading his other books....preferrably those written before the awards and celebrity-hood."
5,Outstanding!,"As is true of all of Mandino's works, this is truly an outstanding and captivating read ... I read it cover to cover in about two hours and then started over again to digest more deeply all the gems of knowledge revealed within. Another life-changing, magnificent novel in true Mandino fashion!"
1,1 star only because no stars is not a choice,"Perhaps it's me, but I had to put this down and walk away on page 101. The greatest miracle is that I made it that far. The only thing I learned is that Mandino claims to sell a lot of books. I say ""claims"" because this beauty has barely cracked the top 100,000 in sales at Amazon. Whatever. I'm obviously not the brightest bulb as it took me 100 pages to figure out that Simon Potter's only role is to pump the author's ego. No wonder Mandino likes him so much."
2,Sad sad sad....,"First up, tossing Bam Margera on the cover is so weak considering he's literally in the movie for 4 seconds as a 'bar hobo'. Anything with Dunn is quite funny, but anything with him and anyone else or just anyone else without Dunn is awful and painfully sub-regular. Just bad all around. Imagine any low budget romantic comedy, then replace anything they said with the the most obviously lazy thing ever.Just an annoyingly bad movie."
1,Stupid!!!!!,"I watched the 1st 5 minutes of this movie and that was enough! If you have an IQ of 1 you might like it, otherwise, it's crap. It is poorly filmed (like many new movies) and I really couldn't stand watching anybody as retarded as these guys are for more than 5 minutes. It isn't funny, it's just plain stupid. I couldn't see wasting any more time than I already have to continue watching it. I couldn't even bring myself to waste anyone elses time by giving it to them so I threw it in the garbage where it belongs. I thing someone should take everyone involved in the making of this film out back and shoot them in the head so they can't waste anyone's time ever again."
1,Save your money,"I am going to do you a favor by keeping you from wasting your time and money on this movie. Even if you are bored out of your mind, stay bored and don`t watch this movie."
4,Great For Home Office --- But....,"I've had the 3330 for about 6 weeks and am very happy so far. Two concerns so far, one is with using odd sized paper, and the other is the scanner function. If scanning is an important function, you will want a different machine, I've never had a dedicated scanner that was so very slow. Making copies and sending faxes goes well, not sure why the scanner is so slow.I use Windows XP Home and had some trouble with using odd size paper, e.g. small envelopes, 5 1/2"" x 8 1/2"" paper, etc. HP Service wasn't very helpful, just suggesting that I reinstall the drivers. Did get it working by defining custom paper sizes in my MS Office suite, so now it works fine with any paper I want to use.Except for the paper problem, and the slow scanning I would have given it 5 stars"
2,faxing problems/design flaws,"I am using this product with a JetDirect print server. It scans, faxes, and prints over my network with no problems.BUT, the scanner carriage wastes time traveling to the opposite side for ADF scanning. It wasted even more time when the carriage would doulble pass per page using the ADF until I upgraded to the lastest firmware. The scanner carriage has a nervous twitching habit for no apparent reason. For faxing, this product is snobby when it come to socializing with other(COMM ERROR 321)fax machines, whereas the competitive products talk just fine to all fax machines using my same senario. YES...I have a clean phone line. YES...I've tried all possible combinations of V.34 and ECM being either on or off. I've been into the Developer's Menu. Have no clue on solving the fax issue in here. PRINTING IS FLAWLESS. If this poduct could digest some attention deficit disorder medication, then it would have some potential."
4,Love it !,"This movie is really good. I loved it since I first saw it. Very good and sad and romantic story. Songs can be abit long and repetative, but the acting is good and storyline great."
5,India will bless your soul with this film.,"India will bless your soul with this film as it touches the depth and beauty of love without reservation. The story of the beautiful courtesan, Umrao Jaan, is so profoundly moving that you might personally experience both impatience for a love so passionate, and conversely fear it. Delve heart first into the complex layers of the beauty of India, her mannerisms and customs, and the characters of this story, impeccably portrayed by Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan. They deserve nothing but the highest praise as they become your iridescent ambassadors into the richness of India, and to life here on this Earth-plane as we seek to find the beauty and inspiration in our own lives thru true, unconditional and unblemished love. This production, directed by J.P. Dutta, is artistry that can only have been channeled from the heavens."
4,lovely and sad,"enjoyable, but have a sad outcome. some historical notes throughout. beautifully filmed. loved the sceenery and the architecture"
4,Umrao Jaan,I thought this was a beautiful movie. The only reason why I rate it a 4 out of 5 is because there was a major skip in a scene and I feel I might have missed something.
4,Bloody good time!,"I've always been a fan of Mel Brooks, and with singular exceptions, I've enjoyed almost all of his films. This is one enjoyable film. I think that the film follows the book a little more closely than the Lugosi version did, but it's really played for laughs. The music is good, the effects are well done, and everyone does a fine job in keeping straight faces throughout. Brooks's humor is not for everyone, because it tends to border on the ribald side. I find that a ""plus"" in this film, because that tends to lighten whatever dark situation the characters are in. Picture quality is excellent, and the audio is perfect. I highly recommend this DVD."
1,Bummed,Well - I purchased this dvd and it turns out that its the wrong region - Bummed!It's a pity because it's a worthy title to go into my Mel Brooks section.
1,DREKULA,If you love Neilson you might like this movie. I actually walked out of the theater when I saw this when it came out. IT IS the ONLY movie I have ever walked out of after paying to see it.That's in 40 years.
4,Alive...And Liking It,"Nobody matches Mel Brooks as a master film parodist. He pretty much owns the genre with films like ""Young Frankenstein"" and ""High Anxiety"". ""Dracula...Dead and Loving It"" is a terrific return to form for Brooks. He doesn't reach the heights that he did with his earlier horror spoof but it'll do. What separates Brooks from his imitators is that he has an affinity for the films he's sending up and not making fun of them. You want to revisit these films after viewing Brooks' parodies. Brooks assembles a terrific cast here led by Leslie Nielsen. Nielsen was probably a septugenarian at the time but he exudes a sexy comic presence. The film isn't up to the comic mastery of the earlier Brooks work but this would be considered an acceptable film from a lesser talent."
4,A fairly decent Mel Brooks film,"I have to admit, this movie is not as funny as Mel Brooks' earlier films but I enjoyed anyway. Leslie Neilsen plays Dracula but like Lt. Frank Drebin in The Naked Gun series. Mel Brooks is Dr. Abraham Van Helsing. He was hilarious as always. My favorite line in the movie is when Van Helsing, Harker and Harvey Korman's character (I forget his name) are chasing down Peter Macnicol's character and he tries to lose them. ""Gentlemen, we are in luck."" ""Why?"" ""Because this man is an imbecile."" Such a funny movie."
2,one of mel brook's worse,"some people compare this to Young Frankenstein. Other than both being horror spoofs there is no comparison. The movie is a parody of the then recently releaded horror Bram Stokers Dracula. Leslie Nielson now has found his niche as a comedic actor. He is good as the infamous count. But, unfortunatley this movie is very heavy handed on the horror and more vulgar than most of Mel Brook's Movies. Young Frankenstein was far superior."
2,Dracula - Dead and Loving It,Dracula - Dead and Loving It is a 1995 movie starring Leslie Nielsen as Dracula and Mel Brooks as Van Helsing. One would think that such a comedic duo would create an amazing comedic satire but the end result is quite mediocre. Some of the jokes are quite funny but on the whole it feels very much so so. Nielsen plays on autopilot and Brooks has seen better days. The costumes look on the cheap and even though it is only about 90 minutes it feels like an overly long movie. Not a terrible film but a very average one. I would like to give a 2+ but since I can not I give it a 2 out of 5. Not recommended. 2/5.
4,"""Good Dracula Spoof!""","Leslie Nielsen and more star in this 1995 Mel Brooks comedy.A clumsy vampire bites his way through London in this spoofof ""Dracula"" films. Leslie was great in this as usual and thisdvd has nice picture and sound, but only commentary andthe trailer. I recommend this good spoof."
4,The Kobayashi Report,"I really love this movie. It is really funny, and really awesome. It is hard to explain how I feel about this one. But this makes the top 50 if not the top 25."
3,Fun!,"Not ""Young Frankenstein"", but very entertaining none the less. Peter McNichol as Renfield is hilarious. Worth renting, especially when so many films take themselves so seriously."
4,dvd dracula,the movie arrived packaged properly and in a reasonable time... the movie inself was ok but not up to what the naked gun series was.... not sorry i bought it...
2,NOT my kind of humor,"This movie is so NOT my cup of tea - too stupid to be funny. However, I do have friends that think this type of humor is hilarious, so if you loved Leslie in Airplane you'll probably love him in this. And for the men, there are plenty of ample bosoms in this for you as an added bonus."
4,Not Brooks best; still funny,"A very funny flick. Not as funny as Young Frankenstein or High Anxiety. I would suggest this to anyone who wants to escape boredom and wants to enjoy the, pretty much, non-stop laffs."
1,This and Hudson Hawk are the only two movies I have ever walked out on.,"I found this movie to be dreadful. As to the people who say this is a companion piece to ""Young Frankenstein"" I can only shake my head in complete amazement.The gags in this are so broad, so old, that you tire of it immediately. It's nothing like the genius that was ""Young Frankenstein.""Brooks' problem is that he can't be allowed to work alone. He has to have someone to contain him, someone like Gene Wilder did with ""YF.""Otherwise he will go total Borsh Belt and with it lose an audience.Never watch this. Instead Watch Young Frankenstein, The Producers, High Anxiety, or a Test Pattern (if one could still be found in the age of cable."""
1,Dreadful,"This film is the mirror image/evil twin of the clasic, inspired, brilliant ""Young Frankenstein"" - deadly unfunny and dull, with Leslie Nielsen completely miscast. I laughed one time during the entire film. A sad latter-day film by the brilliant Mel Brooks, and a far cry from ""Young Frankenstein"", ""Blazing Saddles"", ""History of the World Part I"" and ""High Anxiety"". Avoid at all costs."
1,(...),"This movie trashes one of the most awesome Dracula movies ever made: Francis Ford Copola's ""Bran Stoker's Dracula"". I have read the original Bran Stoker novel more times than I care to admit, and it still stares me witless. There have been many worth movie versions depicting the immortal Vlad the Impaler, and if someone was going to spoof it then it should have been the Wayans Brothers or someone funny. Notice how Leslie Neilson's career dried up once the Naked Gun movies started?"
5,Do you like the laugh ?,Classic Leslie Nielsen is all I need to say. If you have never seen one his movies then this is a must. Follows the basis of other Dracula movies but with a comedic twist that will have you laughing from start to end.
3,It has its moments.,"Overall, I like this film, and it has its moments that are pretty funny, but it seems to lag at times and the attempted humor seems forced instead of having a natural comedic flow. I'm a Leslie Nielsen fan, so for me, it's worth watching it just for that. The character of ""Renfield"", Dracula's right-hand man is also done very well."
4,"Stupid, yet funny!","This is one of those you need to be in the mood for because it's so stupid, yet you can't help but laugh! It's a funny parody of the classic Dracula and they had the perfect cast for each part!"
2,tad dissapointing,My family had high hopes after watching commercials for this movie and we enjoy spoofs but frankly we were dissapointed. There were some really funny scenes but overall we just didn't find it that funny.
1,Beware of This Seller,"I bought this, not realizing that the DVD was in German with no option for switching to English. I only discovered this after breaking the seal and viewing the DVD. The seller did not make the ""German Only"" characteristic clear in his advertisement, and refused to take the product in return when I contacted him. I've always been pleased with past transactions on Amazon, but this one left me feeling cheated."
2,love Leslie Nielson but this movie is just not funny.,I watched the first half hour or so and stopped it. Not funny at all. Could have been much better
3,it was ok,"was ok not that funny, could have been. was not what I expected. Did not like Harvey 's character at all."
4,love it!,"This is another Mel Brooks' classic!He has made great movies, he is in his late 80's but i wish he would continue!"
5,"Very Funny movie, Mel Brooks is #1 in my book","You've got to see this movie, it is so funny i had tears coming out of my eyes. very awesome"
5,funniest movie i have seen in awhile,My husband first showed me this movie. until then i have never heard of the movie. if you like funny movies this is one you should see. even if you dont like vampire movies this is a good one. i think it is well worth the money spent for it.
3,Not bad but also not great,"This is quite a funny film in some moments, but also a little bit predictable. Its a good laugh if you are looking for a cheap one.Wouldn't rate it as good as Spaceballs, though worth a watch every so often."
3,Nice-nice. Not thrilling-but nice,"Not one of Brooks' best..... But I found it very amusing. I am a huge Brooks fan, so I like it!"
1,Gale Encyclopedia of Alternative Medicine :Pregnancy massage,"Don't waste your money. The ""description"" of this very short ""excerpt"" is longer than the actual ""excerpt"". Do yourself a favor and look it up in the dictionary or your own set of encyclopedia's. You'll get more info than this item gives you. Doesn't even deserve the 1 star I gave it! I can'tbelieve amazon sells tiny bits of a book this way."
3,"Not bad, but it can be better...","First time to listen the soundtrace from Japan Godzilla series. The music really gave me a big suprise especially the old one which recorded 15+ years ago. For all the Godzilla fans, this is a very good CD in your CD rack."
5,TOP LITERARY MIDWIFE,"Scott Berg's biography of Max Perkins is a warm, sparkling account of America's greatest editor in the prewar period, the midwife for works by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, and Thomas Wolfe in the twenties and thirties, when big-time publishing converged on New York. Berg's book is cunningly organized: the reader steps at once into the rough and tumble of editorial work at Scribner's, leaving Perkins' early life, marriage, and family to be described in concise digressions taken only after we get another satisfying dollop of publishing history. Unhappily, once Perkins has delivered his discoveries to the public, the rest is mostly about their boozy extravagance (Fitzgerald), bullying ego trips (Hemingway), and petulant indiscipline verging on insanity (Wolfe). So even if, for this reason, you stop two-thirds of the way through, your curiosity about this key figure in modern literary history will be very well satisfied."
4,Poor Max,"Max Perkins was the great editor at Scribners who handled quite a few of the finest writers of the twentieth century, F. Scott Fitzgerad, Hemingway, and Thomas Wolfe being especially noteworthy (and dealt with at length in this biography). One might envy such a man with such a job, but Berg makes it clear that having to deal with the likes of these authors was like walking around with a huge millstone around Max's poor neck. His job was endless and thankless (Wolfe actually betrayed him). You see from the many letters quoted that many of them are blatant pleas for money. Saying that Perkins had to coddle some of these authors like children would be putting it mildly. Berg does an admirable job relaying Perkins's life and hard times. Recommended."
3,"Great music, so so recording.","I really like the music on this CD, too bad the recording quality isn't up to par. Unfortunately bad recording quality seems to be the norm nowdays for most CDs. It's OK for listening on an MP3 player, but really disappoints on a decent sound system. For the music, I'd give it 5 stars, but only 2 stars for the recording quality. As a compromise I ended up giving it 3 stars overall."
5,A landmark book,"Gustavson's book is best read before reading the standard college history texts, because he shows the reader how to think about history and place its diverse events in context. Some chapter titles are ""The Nature of Social Forces"", ""The Institutional Factor"", ""Revolution"", ""The Bases of Loyalty"", ""The Individual in History"", ""The Role of Ideas"", and ""Power"". Gustavson's style is light, entertaining, and readable. The content and conclusions are enormously powerful and far-reaching. ""Revolution"" should be required reading at the State Department. Buy this book. Pay whaterever you have to to own it. One caution for the modern reader: The book contains no charts, no graphs, and no pictures. Like no other book I've encountered, it does contain a broad context for understanding the past and, consequently, the present and the future."
4,Southwest rug,This is a very nice rug and arrived in a very good time. It was well packaged and there was no difficulty. It is a nice variety of colors that will go with many styles of decor. You can put it on the wall or on the floor. Highly recommended.
5,Sprting Chance,Elizabeth Moon is a wonderful writer and her books fill a craving.I really enjoy reading her books and when she and Anne McCaffrey put their heads together it get's really astonishing and gratifying what they can come up with.
2,It's No Brown Bear.,"This is cute- but, it's not as good as Brown Bear.The words don't just roll off your tongue like Brown Bear.I don't find it as ""catchy""."
3,Not meant for babies,"Love the book, but thought we were getting a hard book; instead got a hard cover book. Our 10 month old son loves to read, but also loves to turn pages and rip paper, so not a book we can allow him to turn pages just yet. I give the book a 5 star rating, but the fact that it wasn't clear that it wasn't a hard book for babies was the disappointment."
4,reading fun,"The entire series is a must, but ""From Head to Toe"" is the most engaging. This book gets you and your little one to make sounds and noises, which is fun for toddlers. Really make the investment and get: Brown Bear, Baby Bear, Panda Bear, and From Head to Toe."
2,lacks magic,"This book lacks the magic that Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What do you See? has -- the text is forced into the same structure, but it doesn't work, so it's definitely a book we use for the pictures (which are charming) rather than the narrative, which has no lilt and is rather stunted."
3,PreSchool Recommendation,"My grandson is scheduled to go to kindergarten next fall. The teacher gave us a list of books to read thru the summer for him to get used to ""reading"" actually memorizing words. This book was on the list. It was okay but he really likes Brown Bear, Brown Bear What do You See? best and so do I. My girlfriend said the next book I should purchase in the same series is the Ladybug. She said it is a fun read."
5,Great Book,This is a great book! My son & I both love it. This is one of the first books I'll choose to read to my son because it is fun to read.
4,content does not match the concept,"Being a fan of ""Brown Bear, Brown Bear..."", I bought this Polar Bear book thinking it would be just as fantastic. However, the obscure animals do not make for good sound affects. While it is easy to hiss like a snake and growl like a polar bear, how do you flute like a flamingo or brey like a zebra? Nonetheless, the book is great for teaching colors and new animals. It has the same charming illustrations that Brown Bear has. (My daughter loves the elephant!) I recommend this book for the vivid colors and pictures, but not for animal sounds. It would compliment your child's book collection wonderfully!"
3,Book Review,I never received any sort of contact from this seller until I e-mailed them with my concern. They were very short and offered no apology for it taking nearly a month to get here. I will not purchase from them again.
2,Terrible,"As any reader of the Brown Bear knows, these books are really meant to be read out loud. But who the heck knows how a peacock sounds (can YOU yelp?)? Or several of the other animals here. I just tossed it away in frustration."
2,"Big disappointment after Brown Bear, Brown Bear","Given how much my 18-month-old loves ""Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See"" I thought this also would be a great read-aloud book. Wrong! Even though the whole focus of the book is animals making sounds, a large proportion are basically impossible for a human being to imitate: e.g., Hippopotamus, Flamingo, Peacock, Elephant or Walrus. It's a lot easier to just add sound effects to the animals in Brown Bear, almost all of which can be easily imitated."
3,For a different age group than Brown Bear,"We first purchased Brown Bear, Brown Bear What Do You See for our then 3 month old. He has loved the book since then until now (he's currently 6 months). ""Polar Bear, Polar Bear"" does not capture his (or my) interest in the same way. The animals names and sounds (fluting, etc.) are more difficult to say and in my opinion take away from the melodic rhythm of the predecessor.We will put this book on the shelf for now; perhaps my son and I will like it better when he's older."
4,Nice tool,"The Supa Vac absolutely does what it promises. I was surprised that it actually works, and surprised it does not use a rotor as I expected, in fact I understand the concept but already do not understand how it works precisely, but yes, it produces an acceptable strong suction. It works perfectly to take out sand, little stones and objects from the ground of a pool. In my case I have a lot of dust which can not be hold by the included filter. I put one of my socks over it, but its not enough and already has influence on the suction. So much of the dust goes through it and remains in the pool. In my case the filter system of my little 4000L inground pool ist not strong enough to filter everything before the dust sinks on the ground again. But Supa Vac at least brings out a part of it.But do not order it from Silvo Home and Garden! First I ordered it from them but they never shipped it (take a look at their profile, they have over 30% negative feedback!), finally I got it from an other shop."
1,"""Supa-Vac Pool Cleaner""","Yes, this pool vacuum does what it says. But, there are two major problems. #1 The ""sock"" filter lets fine sediment through - which re-clouds the water. #2 Using the hose with enough water pressure to create the vaccum - fills the pool too much. I tried it in my 1,100 gallon pool (fairly small); yet I was disappointed upon opening the box to discover how small the vacuum head was - barely 4"" wide. As for SilvoHome & Garden, the business from which it was sent - I couldn't be more pleased. I returned the Supa-Vac to them and they have credited Amazon who will in turn credit my account. Emma"
1,Piece of crap!,"""This versatile remote allows users to operate virtually all home entertainment equipment"" ...in their dreams!We got this remote to replace the four remotes we had in our living room setup. After some work, it could control the TV, VCR and DirecTV, but there just was no way to get it to control our Bose DVD system.After ordering a more expensive learning remote for our living room setup, we though maybe we could use the Jasco for our lower tech combo in our bed room; after all, we didn't have Bose equipment there. However, in there it wouldn't control the bottom of the line mass produced Phillips DVD player -- there was only one possible code for Phillips DVD, and it didn't work!Don't get this unless you KNOW for a FACT that it controls every device you want it to. Otherwise it's a crap shoot. We gave ours to Good Will."
4,NEED HELP,I lost the manual to the remote and I forgot how to program it for tv's and all the other stuff
2,"If you are buying for the tin, skip it!","I love the cookies and can get them by the bag at the closest gourmet deli. I decided to splurge and pay more to get the tin for my kitchen counter. Somehow, in spite of being in a box with bubble wrap, it arrived dented at the top below the cover. So I spent more money than needed to get a cast off dented box that probably had been hanging out for a while. Do yourself a favor - if you want the box, go and buy it where you can select an undamaged one."
1,What the heck did they do to the wrappers?!?!,"My family has enjoyed these cookies for more than a decade, and at our Christmas Eve dinner, we brought them out at the usual time, and started with the annual tradition of ""flying angels."" For those of you not familiar with these cookies, if you wrap them in a cylinder, and light the top, when the fire reaches the base, the wrapper shoots up in the air. It's actually quite a bit of fun.So imagine our surprise this year when NONE of the wrappers would fly. We compared old wrappers and new, and SOMETHING has changed about the wrappers. Whether it's wax, weight, or something else, none would fly for us (and we have an awful lot of people who are experienced with this).So, if you're a fan of these cookies, and the fun tradition that's sprung up around them, I caution you, you may not be able to enjoy them this year as you have done in the past."
2,Too sweet to buy without flying paper trick,"Like another reviewer, I am disappointed that as of 2010, the wrappers no longer float up into the air when lit. In fact, I've written this review only because we had gotten some for a 60th birthday dinner party we hosted and were curious why they didn't work.The cookies themselves are light in texture, flavorful (very...H-bomb department), and crunchy. But they are so sweet your molars will explode on contact.To many people these are good things. But since I do not like extreme sweetness, I'm not one of them. Too bad, because the texture is very nice. Anyway, you folks who are averse to sugary stuff should stick to your favorite biscotti.We would serve these cookies on the side with the ""main"" dessert, exclusively on special occasions when we wanted to do the delightful little trick with the wrappers. Without that ability, we have no reason to buy the cookies."
2,bitter and not that yum,"bought these for a group of family who loves coffee / tea and was visiting my home. the packing is awesome and the cookies look very preciously packed.however I wasn't impressed by them at all taste wise. found them to be bitter and lots of essence. was disappointed as I was really counting on them and thought with the packing and reviews, I had found the right one."
5,Amaretti Cookies,I have used these cookies in holiday cake for many years and it is so much easier to get them on amazon than go looking store to store to store.Thank you so much for listing them for sale on line..
5,yummmmyummmm!!!,"These are the best cookies...no other company can match the freshness, flavor and crunch. I'm glad I can get them through Amazon"
5,Wonderful Treasure,"This is such a wonderful book to have in your collection. It is like having a person teaching lesson from the man himself. I use it as a reference book when preparing sermons or talks because there are so many insights, quotes, thoughts and ideas. You can just see by the notes that DL Moody had in his Bible that he had a deep love of God and His Word. If you are looking for something to freshen up you way of thinking or a great book just to spark off new ideas then this is the book for you. Great stuff! A real treasure in Christian books!!"
1,Not worth the asking price,"Frankly, the information contained in this book isn't anything you couldn't learn in any general psychology, self-help or beginner's pagan book, and likely for less money.That isn't even considering that the author's grammar is utterly atrocious. Really, her editor should be fired for not curbing her excessive love of commas & apostrophes. If you're at all OCD about grammar, this book will be your equivalent of fingernails run over a chalkboard.Truly, this book is -barely- a step above those basics by Silver RavenWolf.While this book does contain some worthwhile information - it's simply MY humble opinion that it doesn't contain $32 worth. Spend your money elsewhere; in the future, now that I am wiser, I shall do the same."
1,No CD!,I ordered this book twice and both times there were no CDs thatcame with it. It states on the back of the book that there's a cd butIt's not the case!
1,don't waste your money,There are many other books out by credible authors that I would buy before I even think of buying this one.
4,Great to hear some new old stuff...,Great sound. If you enjoyed her as a Supreme then you should really enjoy this CD.
5,WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!,"This record puts me in the mood for dancin'. This record puts me in the mood for drivng fast safely, with my seatbelt on. This record puts me in the mood for kissing a kittie's face. This record makes me want to hump furniture with a smile. YAY!"
5,Yeah I like BS!,"Casio keyboards with phat beats... what more can ya ask for? Fun lovin' and political, BS 2000 know how to have a good time. You'll be tappin' yer feet along with da beat. Get up and do the ""Side to Side"", the dance craze that's sweepin' the nation! Buy this CD!"
1,Not Ghost in THE Shell,"For all of you who love Ghost in the Shell and music by Yoko Kanno, this is not it! This is scream death metal or something. Needs a better title that isnt already pretty much used."
2,Poor quality,"The author seems to use quote after quote from ""apostles"" of the Mormon church stating that Blacks are ""equal"" to Whites in the eyes of the church.The Quotes are great but they are in direct opposition to church practices until 1978.As for the quality of the book. There are errors ofter errors that a simple spell check would have corrected. Page after page has spelling and typo errors.An editor might have been a good idea."
5,WALL STREET of Hollywood Movies,"This film is really funny. If you're thinking about working in Hollywood or want to know what it's like, this film is the WALL STREET of the Making-It-In-Hollywood genre. Better than SWIMMING WITH SHARKS and a lot funnier."
5,delicious poetry-- Neruda would blush and weep with joy,"Would that we all could receive Letters from a Stranger. The story behind this book (told by Isabelle Allende in the introduction) is one of old-fashioned romance, mystery and curiousity. This is a book that surpasses its introduction. Poem after poem, Jim Tipton shares with the reader his passionate treasure chest. His images range from familiar (window shades) to shocking (feet found in the desert). Every line sings with wanton beauty and longing. Tipton is a seeker who has found the key to poetry, yet keeps searching. This is a book to cherish, to share and to snuggle with all by yourself. Read the poems out loud ... there's a magic to these words that you'll discover when you speak them. Letters from a Stranger is a triumph for the West."
5,Nice idea,"This makes nice little triangular sandwiches, perfect for snacking! Great product! I would highly recommend this unique little sandwich cutter."
2,Disappointed,I was very excited to get this since I cut the crust off sandwiches and then cut into 4 pieces at least twice a day for my kids. Was not impressed though - you need to really press down hard to get it to cut an untoasted sandwich and then you need to help pull the crust off. Was not the time saver I expected.
1,Inaccurate + misleading,As a professional in the field of early childhood special education in NYC I can vouch for the need for what this book promises. Unfortunately for those of us that know the field and NYC it does not deliver. It is full of inaccurate and misleading information from beginning to end. The fact that some parents are raving about it says more to me about the confusing red tape parents have to go through rather than the helpfulness and clarity of this book.To parents who want some help- Resources for Children with Special Needs and each boroughs Early Childhood Direction Center offer *excellent* free guidance. (And I am not affiliated w/ either though I am grateful for the real wisdom their employees tirelessly offer to parents *and* professionals.)
5,Replacement item,I have an old weed eater & was having a tough time finding replacement parts. Thought I was going to have to buy a brand new one even though I don't use it much. They had the right product at the right price & were easy to do business with.
2,Not what I expected - too costly,Purchased these thinking that they were of good quality - not too bad - but really not worth the extra bucks. I found them very tight at the top/under knee and then loose in the foot - and I wear this type every dayI would not recommend -
3,Less Talk More Rawk,"Overall a good CD. Great Vegan Punk Rawk.Animal Friendly,Anti-Facist,Gay Positive Punk rockers Unite!"
3,Propagandhi's Worst,"Ok, I luv Propagandhi, but this album just doesn't do it. Granted I like their newer stuff much better, but HTCE was till a decent album. This is the same basic style, but more controlled. Lyrically, I dislike John John's contributions, thinking that they're not very good, boring, mundane, etc. etc. Overall, not very good Progressive Thrash. (He has done great stuff with The Weakerthans though.) Propagandhi put out their weakest tracks of their career on this album, and it's a good thing that TETA came out later; Otherwise, they would have gone the way of Lagwagon. So, if you like NOFX, you'll probably like this album. If you liked ""How To Clean Everything,"" you'll probably like this album. If you liked ""Today's Empire, Tomorrow's Ashes,"" Stear clear."
1,less rock more crap,this cd is lame for a few reasons 1) the music is week no real strong song nothing stands out as good the music is basicly watterd downed NOFX 2)they seem to be more about talking then rocking IE it seems there not a band just an activist group that plays instruments 3)they dont eat meat..... i guess what im trying to say is regardless of thier views they seem more about sending a message then making good music....oh yea ps they said if you can make a case for eating meat you can make a case for lycnhing black people... rock on propaghandi!
5,I used to own this album,"I'm on youtube listening to songs from this album all the time, wishing I still had it. I may have to break down and order a new copy since the last one wandered off."
4,Excellent follow up to How to Clean Eveything!!,"Propagandhi has done it again and put out another awesome punk album. Although the music itself is not as good as their first album the messages are definately more in your face. It is refreshing to lsiten to a band that has convictions and intelligent views on society. They support their views and don't just spout out mindless crap. The music itself is great with fast, hard guitars and good melodys. Everything you liked about Prpagandhi is back and in your face whether you like it or not. A must own for all true punk fans, even if you don't agree with their beliefs.""The unexamined life is not worth living"" --Socrates"
5,This album kicks major ass.,"It's nice to finally be able to find a band whose music and lyrics are both excellent. These guys have something important to say, and unlike some punk bands, they know how to say it without sounding like morons. I have a lot of respect for propagandhi. Even though I disagree with some of their beliefs, I still think that this album is worth buying for anyone who loves punk and has a functioning brain. This album and their previous one, How to Clean Everything, are two of the best punk albums ever made. Propagandhi kicks ass."
2,Make sure you check for firmware upgrades,"Right now this product does not have a ""resume"" feature, which to me is a must for an MP3 player unless you only listen to short songs - and don't listen to spoken-word programs or books-via-MP3."
2,Breaks a lot,"I've had three or four of these, three of them were gotten under warranty when they product stopped working. They work fine for about a year, then something seems to happen either with the software or the transmission of power between the battery and the device. I was so tired of sending them back that I went and bought another brand of MP3 player.On the plus side, and the reason I give it a two instead of one stars is that it really had good sound quality. Also, it was the perfect size and had the right features for me at that time. And, it was water resistant and reasonably shatterproof."
4,"Great Little Player, A few Small complaints","I bought this little 1GB player for a trip because the Sony MP3 player I have can only be charged via a computer, and I won't be traveling with my laptop. That said, this thing is tiny, weighs nothing, and since it runs on AAA batteries, is great for travel. However, I quickly learned that you can only ""lock"" the keys while it's playing, and since the buttons on it are very easily pressed, the thing often runs through a battery while in my gym bag! I've started removing the battery when I'm not using it.I'm not a fan of music software either, and I like that this player comes with software, but also functions like a flash drive, so click and drag works just as well as using their music program. overall, I'm happy with it."
3,Basic book on how to program TPMs,"The book may have some writing issues as Kinney writes in a very informal style. But engineers aren't known for their writing - they're known for building things. We are also known for being very critical.Still, his book provides a basic background in trusted computing and the cryptography implemented using TPMs. It's main focus is explaining the various Trusted Platform Module (TPM) commands used within the TCG v1.1b spec. There is a chapter on some of the differences between v1.1b and v1.2. I would have liked to see some very basic c programs included to get a better feel of actually using the commands together. That would be my only real complaint.The author does have some pride toward the product he helped develop. But from talk within the TCG community, he no longer works for Atmel, where he helped developed the TPM firmware. So he's not trying to sell anything he can profit from. I think he's just proud of his team's work."
1,this thing is nonsesne,"I work for the company that makes the TPM's in the book, and the company that Steve used to work for. This book is simply wrong in many places. Steve blamed the editor for ""correcting"" the book. Go get the IBM press book or just read standards on the TCG site. We use the copies we have (we got a case of them) to level wobbly desks."
3,"was ok, not me",It was very backwoods and a great product of the arena but not what I was looking for.
5,Wither to Death,"received cd faster then expected to, works great for a used cd with no damage other then case will encourge all my friends to buy from smogtown LTD."
5,The great Visual-kei/J-rock album,"This one is for anyone who is tired of all folk-based domestic rock music. This comes with DVD that tells somewhat J-rock is about. I was not even a J-rock listener before I listened to this and it totaly changed me. This band is the leading position of the new movement that may change the surface of rock music in this country. This album is the good one to start to get on. If you are not old bags that can't understand new wave/ culture, get it and check it out."
3,Not a bad CD,Not one of my favorite CDs but it has a few songs that stand out and keep in my play list. I would buy another CD from this group.
1,"I love Dir en grey, but this album has nothing to offer","I really really wanted to like this album because I`ve been a fan since their big label debut `Gauze`, but this album shows them tired and out of ideas. Frankly I wished I had saved my money. I was lucky enough to see them in Sapporo a couple days ago and while the show was good, the songs, mostly taken from `Withering to death.`, were uninspiring at best.`Gauze` worked because of the X Japan influnce and strong, varied songwriting and `Kisou` worked because of the absolute rage conveyed in the music and those albums I recommend a million times over `Withering to death.`"
2,,"This Japanese band produces noisy, psychotic Rock with Metal influences and a touch of industrial music. Sounding very funky at times, mostly due to the improvised bass playing, the band go from extremely quiet moments to furious bursts of adrenaline, resulting in intense passages accompanied by screaming vocals. You can't deny the influence of punk rock on many of the songs. Cleanly sung catchy choruses are present throughout the whole album. While these guys seem to be having fun while experimenting with different musical genres, in the end this all sounds like a mixed bag of incoherent compositions."
2,"Decent glass cover, functional pan, but...","The product arrived safe and sound, and definitely was a good value for what it was. Like the other reviewer, however, I am skeptical about whether this is actually T-Fal. (It is not prominently marked, nor as sturdily made, as is the case with my large collection of authentic, out-of-the box, T-Fal cookware.)The glass cover was my only reason for purchasing this, and was worth the price alone, though I really didn't need the steam hole (which my T-Fal cookware covers do not have). The way the pan itself is riveted together, and lack of T-Fal's exclusive even-heating surface, make me question if it is actually T-Fal, but from my p.o.v. the cost was worth it for a new, replacement, glass cover (which I was unable to find by itself). In sum, the seller was ok, but this product does not appear genuine (or top-shelf, if it is). I guess... ""you get what you pay for""."
2,Not such a good item,I really spected more from this pan. All the food that I cook in it gets either burn or sticks. I had to buy another one in a store.
4,RFID Smart Cards may be HUGE,"An excellent survey of the Smart Card industry for 2001. And still very relevant. It describes the state of the art in terms of the technical capabilities of the latest cards. Plus the possible directions of advance suggested by the major players.The competencies of the latter are also well outlined. So the book is not just for the engineer. Marketing and financial analysts may well find it of use in their fields.One related type of card, that uses RFID, may be on the verge of huge growth. Its cost of production is steadily falling, and may plummet if it is broadly adopted in a mass market. Interested readers should check this out."
3,Use It & Loose It,It works if you discipline yourself to stick with the plan. Having a group participate is helpful. The original version with the workbook is better.
2,Lacking in nutrition information,"I was very disappointed in this book. There was very little written in the book about the actual diet part of the plan. I have the original book and workbook and it had alot more information about the different food groups and what goes into each group. I bought this book because I wanted an updated version of the nutrition information but was surprised to find no nutrition information, only Carol's story and the 12 weeks of devotions. There is some good information mixed in with the devotions, but I wanted something that was easy to find and all together. I don't know if the information I wanted was in the journal or not, I guess this was just a way to make more money."
3,not for me,"I did this study/diet/life style with a group of women. All I can say is that it was not for me. I don't eat too much or too often. I eat organic fruit and vegetables more often than not. Yet I am overweight. This study assumes you are overweight because you are eating too much and not the right foods. If that is the case for you, and you enjoy studies that are light and fluffy, then this is a great Bible Study with a built in support group as you lose weight. If you can't identify with normal weight problems then you will only feel more alone and frustrated."
5,Absolutely my favorite,"This perfume is far and above my favorite perfume but not all that easy to find. I'm very sensitive to lots of the other more popular brands, but this is one that doesn't bother me at all and I love the scent."
4,Good...,"I'm a big reader of Scott Adams' Dilbert comic strip syndication, and I love it. I also love his and Larry Charles work on this series. The voice cast was excellent, for one. To hear celebrities like Daniel Stern and Chris Elliot, to popular voice artists such as Tom Kenny, Maurice LaMarche, and Tress MacNeille. The series overall is excellent, though I wish it was more than just 30 episodes. This does rate with Futurama and the Simpsons, and deserves more attention. So, please, buy the DVD, and maybe Scott and Larry might just continue it, with any luck at all."
4,cool,when i was little i thouht dilbert was a cartoon version of drew carry. when i was seven i got a dilbert candy despenser. i like the comic. late one night i fliped through the guide and on comedy cetral was dilbert. senice then ive seen every episode and stay up late at night just to see them agian i hope i get this for my soon birthday its at the top of my listp.s. Hail Dogbert the almighty
1,Horrible Adaptation of Wonderful Comic,"I bought this hoping it would live up to the wonderful comic, however I was completely disappointed. Each episode tried to stretch the typically hilarious one liners of the comic strip into a 30min. comedy and it was a horrible disaster. I just kept waiting for jokes that never came and I finally gave up after 6 episodes. There was a reason the series was canceled after only one season. If you buy this thinking it will be at all like the comic strip you are going to be disappointed."
3,Best in small doses,"I bought this DVD because I had fond memories of the series. But there's a reason they only broadcast it once a week: it's bloody depressing. Seen in a bunch like this, you soon become overwhelmed by Adams' unrelentingly negative and cynical view of life. After about three episodes, you find yourself wanting to throw things at all the cruel and mercenary side characters. (On one of the interviews, Adams says he gave Dogbert all the non-dog characteristics he could think of -- disloyalty, pessimism, selfishness, disaffection, etc. That explains a lot.)Animation, acting, and writing are all excellent, and if you liked the show you'll probably HAVE to have this DVD. I just wish it weren't so annoying."
3,LOUD HOWARD!,"I just picked up this set and watched the first of the 30 episodes. LOUD HOWARD is in the first episode, which I think is funny in itself, as he is not a popular character. He is referred to as the ""Loud Guy"". I know in my office there is a ""loud Howard"", as Im sure there is one in every office. I can't wait to see the rest of the episodes. I see in the opening sequence we have Catbert, Dogbert,Ratbert, Wally, Alice, Pointy Haired Boss, Dilbert's Mom, and Asok the Intern. I wonder if we will see Phil from Heck, Bob the Dinosaur, or the Elbonian village."
4,Good but not really the Dilbert I know,"This has two seasons of Dilbert cartoons, which is two seasons more than I previously knew existed. I read Dilbert comics fairly regularly and while the characters look the same, they just don't seem to have the same personality I would imagine them having. I didn't really expect them to be the same as the comics, but something was missing. Maybe the irony wasn't quite as strong.Which isn't to say they weren't good. My daughter loved the cartoons, but when I handed her some of my Dilbert comics, she didn't enjoy them as much. So the humor is obviously different."
3,Great show - Flawed playback options,"I love this show, is funny, witty, and even thou I'm a lawyer and I work at a bank, I feel like I'm watching a show about my office. There is no reason to lower the calification on this instance. On the other side, and my principal complain, is that there are no sound or subtitle options, I can enjoy the show, but I can't watch it with my girlfriend since she doesn't speak english fluently enough."
4,A Comic Strip Comes to Life.,"I've been a fan of Dilbert ever since learning to read. The comic strip was always the first one I turned to once I got the morning paper.I accidently came up on this TV show. I was amazed that it was made into a animated show and I was also amazed how I could've missed something like this.All I can say is, this show is a must watch for anyone who's EVER had a job or worked a day in their life. The comedy, rather its social or satirical, is great. The show may not be up to par with The Family Guy but it sets up there with the best.If you enjoy: The Family Guy, The Critic, and Futurarama then you'll enjoy this."
3,Good collection.,I was very happy with this TV series and saw it was on DVD. All the episodes are here although I wish there were a few more features to go with them.
5,Amazing!,A amazing TV show. To bad it was on the long gone UPN network. Hopefully if the DVDs keep selling they will make make more episodes so buy up!
5,I Was There.,I was at NKP at the same time as the author. His book brought back vivid memories of my year there. Most important I learned of the mission that I was never really knew. I was told to perform my duties and forget what I saw and heard.
5,A Must Read!,I am currently an Air Force pilot and this is one of my favorite books. I highly recommend this book. Mr Drury's writing is top-notch and puts you in the cockpit of the Skyraider. Reading this book was a sobering view through his window of the Vietnam War.
5,Great A-1 book,One of my favorite Vietnam books. Tracking the maturing of a pilot as they build up missions flying the Trail.
5,Welcome to THOWBACK THEATER!,"Like a lot of others, I first purchased this recording in cassette format and didn't really appreciate it fully until I found it on CD. This takes me back and the way he handles his ballads is off the charts, with ROSES being my favorite and the track that get constant play. Howard's voice fits perfectly with the song choices and makes this a must have for my collection."
1,GOOD SERVICE - BAD PRODUCT,"This table blend is nothing more than pepper--DIFFERENT KINDS OF GROUND PEPPER. Not much seasoning here. I made the mistake some time ago buying a large quantity of this stuff thinking it was the ""Original"" blend. The ""Table"" blend is all pepper and nothing more. If you want the good stuff, do NOT buy this one. Buy the ""ORIGINAL.""The only good thing I have to say about this purchase is the service. The service is great, I'm giving low rating to the product itself, not the service. Mrs Dash should label this product ""SEASONING PEPPER."""
5,Indispensable,"This is not just a great book on Uzbekistan, but is a wonderful introduction to Central Asia. I feel that it is a labor of love, not a hackneyed travel guide. Visiting Uzbekistan is not easy -- having this book in your hand will make it all seem worth it."
5,superb,"niebuhr is more condensed than the recipe of milk in thai dishes, yet has kernels of real truth and clarity.no run-around, no long-winds, no boring-bragsit's the real deal, in 1/10 the pages of others and with original thought (imagine!)"
1,blah,"allright Ducky Boys ""Dark Days"" and ""No Gettin Out"" are two of my favorite CD's in my collection. the new ducky boys CD's however i cant stand, its sounds to commercial, like a song youd here on m-tv being requested by a lettle girl with a room full of unicorns or something im gonna sell it to a used cd store and pretend i never bought it! oh ya ""the war back Home"" is even worse.now to be fair to the music and to the Ducky Boys, because with there other music i consider them my favorite band! my style of music is punk! you might like the newer ducky boys, to each is own!"
2,Christ for Muslims,"(From another's review): Chapters include: Witnessing to Muslims; Brief History of Islam; The Bible and the Qur'an; The Doctrine of God; Jesus and Muhammad; Value of the Individual; Muslim Teachings on Key Doctrines of the Christian; ""Prophecies"" In Scripture; Predictions Regarding the Future; Glossary of Islamic Terms."
1,BE CAREFUL - NOT AS DESCRIBED!,"I trusted Amazon to list the product information correctly - how hard can it be? It's written on the back of the DVD case! Amazon product details state ""Region 1 (U.S. and Canada only) but on the back of the DVD case it CLEARLY states ""DVD 9, PAL, Zone 2"" TWO. Will not play on U.S. equipment. So I couldn't rate the DVD above one star as I couldn't watch it. VERY VERY disappointed. Expected more from Amazon."
3,WORTH IT?,"Got a great price on the cable from Amazon (half retail) so I splurged on the high tech cable. I used a cheap cable before and was satisfied but as I was upgrading my system, I needed some new cables anyway so decided to replace the older cheap cable. I do not have the highest end TV or DVD player but I did not notice even the slightest difference in picture quality from the Monster cable and the cheap Component cable supplied with my DVD player. Not alot of cable choices out there but if I had to do it again, I would just go with the cheapest component cable I could find rather than the expensive Monster cable."
4,Works great,"This works great...but with HDMI out now...HDMI is cheaper, and has DIGITAL picture and audio. This THX 600 series is great, but the cost is still high, when you can purchase great HDMI (v. 1.3) cables for $10 - $20. Don't get ripped off. If you are in the market for HDMI cables, Monster makes great cables, but it's not worth paying $50 or even $100 for the same cable you can purchase for $20 (for 2 sets of 8ft long cables). I purchased my HDMI cable at Costco, and it comes with a cleaning solution, of which I haven't tried yet. But the picture and sound quality is awesome."
5,Gripping Book from the Start,"""Hatchet,"" by Gary Paulsen is a great book! I was hooked from the very beginning and I don't usually like adventure/survival type books. What I liked most about the book is that it is about a boy that was my same age (when I read the book), the forest area reminded me a lot of Island Park, Idaho and so it made it easier to relate to. ""Hatchet"" reminds me of ""Island of the Blue Dolphins,"" by Scott O'Dell because both of the characters had to learn how to survive by themselves. Any reader above fifth grade will totally love the book...hey, I did!"
5,An awsome book!,"This was a really exciting book! A 13 year old boy named Brian Robeson was on his way to see his father who lives in Canada. Until the pilot of the single engine airplane he was fling in, had a heart attack. Brian had to land the plane on a L-shaped lake, when it finally crashed, he swam saftly to shore. From then on, he has to learn how to survive alone in the wilderness, armed only with a hatchet. I highly recommend this book to everybody. Page after page it was a great book!"
4,Untitled,"The Hatchet by Gary Paulsen is about a boy named Bryan Robeson who goes to visit his divorced father for the summer. As he is flying towards his destination of Canada, the plane crashes, leaving Bryan as the lone survivor. He is stranded in the wilderness with only the clothes he is wearing and the hatchet his mother gave him as a farewell gift. Bryan must learn to survive in wild with the knowledge of the divorce and The Secret that caused it, tormenting him at every moment.I really enjoyed this book, because, although it has scarcely any dialogue, Paulsen manages to keep you interested, keeps you reading, curious about Bryan's fate. You start to wonder what you would do if in Bryan's shoes."
4,AMONG THE TOP ADVENTURE STORIES FOR BOYS AND SCOUTS,"Gary Paulson is an excellent storyteller with a keen sense of adventure. the story opens with a young boy en route via a small plane to see his father in the wilderness when the plane crashes and the pilot dies. All the boy has is a tiny hatchet that was given to him before he left on his trip. He sets out on a path of survival as he awaits rescuing. This book contains mature themes (death, consequences, mistakes) that portray the realistic images that Gary paulson portrays. Having three Scouts in the house, this was an adventure book they all approved of enought that they have encouraged us to purchase more Gary Paulson books."
4,The Hatchet,"This book is about a boy named Brian. His parents get divorced and he crashes the plane that was taking him to see his dad on the Canadian oil field he works at. He survives with only a hatchet by building a house which gets invaded by a skunk, a porcupine, and finally ripped down by a bear. He decides to build it better and it seems as though he'll be okay, until he has a bad day when he gets hit with a tornado and a moose. The tornado rips down his new house and so he swims to the plane, gets the supplies, turns on the emergency transmitter, and gets rescued."
1,THIS BOOK WAS TERRIBLE!,"I hated this book because Brian just thought about food, threw up, and whined about silly things. He was always making weird noises. Plus, there was no dialoge and there were no other charecters. This book was just awful. Who could like this book? !"
1,DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!,"This book was terrible! If there was an option of zero stars that's what I'd give this book. (...) My mom gave this book to me and I was eager to start it, but about three chapters into it I had to put it down. About two months later I picked it up again thinking of giving it another chance. No way am I ever going to finish this book I thought after geting about 3/4 through. And I didn't! Now I refuse to read any other books by Gary Pulsen. EVER!"
1,This Stinks!,This is the wrost book i have ever read! there is no excuse for Gary Pulsen to write shull a dull book! If i could erase this from my mind believe me i would!
1,It was the most boring book that I've ever read.,"I hated the book because it was just like a soap opera. He keeps repeating things over and over and over again. I bet he said ""the secret"" 65 times. This book was HORRIBLE!"
5,Hatchet,"I am 14 year's old kid who doesn't like to read books, but when I picked up the book hatchet it was a different story. Hatchet is based on a story with a young boy named Brain who is going to see his dad a long ways away from his house and then he runs in to a problem you can picture what is always happening during the book. When you need this book you never want to stop it is always exciting. Read hatchet to find out more about this book because it's a really good book. I really like to read what the main character of the book is always getting himself into."
3,Hatchet,"If you like to read mild adventure books and read a lot of Gary Paulsen or thinks he's a pretty good writer, you should read the Hatchet series (Hatchet, Brain's Winter, Brain's Return) they were all good. I call it the Hatchet series, because it's three books that continue on to each other. Except Brain's Winter and Brain's Return aren't exactly continuations. But overall the series is pretty good. I would read all three again and again. The books are all very detailed and descriptive."
3,My impression after reading,"Brian robeson - He was just thirteen years old - suddenly had to live in Canadian wilderness with nothing, but a wind breaker and the hatchet that he took by his mother. He had grown with much experience in there, for example, maiking fire, finding some food and something to need how to survive alone, of corse he made mistakes sometimes.A such boy as just thirteen years old fought to wilderness alone was moved my heart. I like this story but a little difficult to understand for me. This book told me important things that if I fall in black despair, even I keep a hope and try it my self, I may find the road I should go. I recommand this book to children. Of corse any one that is stading English now."
4,let me see,"Brian who was thirteen-year-old got on a plane with a pilot to visit his father. Suddenly the pilot died of heart attack, so he was confused and panicked. He was left behind at wilderness. But he tried to survive somehow by using some ways. Even this serious situation he didn't forget meanings of ""The Secret""... How did he escape from this situation? I like this book. This story tells us it is important to accomplish as hard as you can. And you can learn how to survive in a place which is nothing. Because this story drows all eyes. So i was attracted by brave Brian's behavior. the most interesting plot is a part of real story!! And this story structures by basis of author's experience. I recommend this book everyone who are interested in this book. And I recommend this book to other ESL students. Because this book describe a feeling of character, situation well, and has good expressions."
4,Hatchet's review,"I think this book is the one of the best outdoor adventure story. I recommend to other ESL student. Because, this book is not to hard to read and it's very exciting story. Brian's parents are wanted to divorce. Brian knew about mother's cheating. so, he wants to tell his father. But, when he was in the way to go his father, his plane crashed. Hewas starded in the wilderness alone. He learned how to survive, make a fire, how to hunt, how to make shelter... Brian going to change his character. First time, he was very weak, but he became strong person. I think is very good for teenagers or for English student. This book make reader to think about different from our normal life's situation. This book is very good book. but, this book's end part is so rapidly finish. This part is only feel the lack of this book."
4,A story about a survivor,"Hatchet is about a brave young man named Brian Robeson. After his parents' divorce he is flown up to Canada and the pilot has a heart attack. Brian has to be brave and land the plane by himself. Once he has landed he has to be brave and deal with a bear, skunk, ""fool birds"" and a porcupine. Brian also has to find food every day, other wise he would just die.I recommend this book to someone who enjoys the outdoors or wildlife. I think it is rated a 4 out of 5, because of how well the book is described and how vivid it is. I think almost anybody who picks it up would want to find out if he is rescued."
5,This book is a must have book!,"This book in my opinion is a very good amazing book about a boy who survives. The book is about a boy named Brian who gets lost in the wilderness after an accident. He tries to take on the challenge of man vs. nature with only a hatchet. This book in my opinion teaches you how to survive in the wilderness by yourself without any electronics. Even if you don't like non-fiction survival books you should give this one a chance by reading it. If you don't like the beginning of this book, I suggest you keep reading until about Chapter 7 as it evolves into the quest for survival."
3,Hatchet,Hatchet is an exsiting book.I think that because the Character Brian Robensen survided many things like a plane crash and a tornado he survided all the worst things.And thats why you should buy this exsiting book.
4,hatcet,The book made me fill like i was in the book it was very amazing and it was very actioney and i think you should read it
3,hacking the hatchet,I thought the hatchet was an all right book but it wasn't the best book I've ever read. Gary Paulsen could have expanded this book and made it better. Because it was really short and he could have made it longer. It was only 200 pages. I can relate to this book because Brian and me both hunt and love outdoors. I also know what it feels like to lose your stuff by a tornado because this summer my house was hit by an tornado. If you liked Gary Paulsen you should check out some of his other books because they are al full of adventure
3,helppp,"Hachet, by Gary Paulsen, is a very strang book. Brian Robeson must survive in the wilderness by his observations of nature. He's a kid who has horrible luck and then good luck. For example, Brian is cold and mosquitos are biting him. He learns how to make fire, which gets rid of the coldness and the smoke gets ride of the mosquitos. I like the book because of all the animals Brian sees in the forest. he sees wolves, rabbits, porcupines, birds, turtles, and fish. I also like the way he survies and how he depends on one single tool. I would recomend this book to people likes adventure stories."
2,Hatchet,"I'm sorry, but it was BORING! I really disliked it. It was kind of interesting the way he survived, but still it was boring. It seemed to drag on forever, and there just seemed no point. I mean I know there was a point and a plot, but I don't think it was shown very well."
2,"Ah, no.","Oh, sure, Paulsen is brilliant. And in theory, this book should be, too. Paulsen does a good job of writing, but he does in the wrong way. It's far from a Swiss Family Robonson or a Robinson Crusoe. Heck, after this, you'll be yerning for Gilligan's Island! With little events and nothing happening, the book gets old...fast."
3,out in the woods,"Have you ever been suck in the woods? Well Brian Robeson has. In the book hatchet, Brian is on his way to visit his father in canada when his pilot has a heart attack. Brian crash lands the plane into a lake. Brian has to face the elements of nature and hunger. He had to learn how to survive with only his hatchet. This book is for middle school age students because vocabulary is exellent and is easy to understand.Overall, Hatchet was great book that you cant put down. There was a tornado that destroyed everthing and scattered everything Brian had.hatchet was good book that teaches you to survive in the wilderness. Brian had to gather berries, spear fish, and hunt rabbits to survive.Hatchet was a fiction story because it didnt really happen.Brian Robeson has a plane crash and is trasnded in the wilderness of canada. He has to learn how to hunt for food and gather berries. Brian has to deal with mosquitos, flies, bears, moose, and tornados."
4,Great book !,I thouhgt this was a great book for all ages! It is about a kid brian robinson who gets stranded in the wilderness and now he has to endure life in the wildhi
4,Hatchet audio,"I am using this audio product for the first time with ELL high school students who are learning English. They seem to be enjoying the product up to this point, and I will offer a more complete evaluation later."
5,Outstanding,"I first read Hatchet when I was in 5th grade, after that I was hooked on Gary Paulsen books. His writing is fantastic!!"
4,Good Read.,Great and realistic coming-of-age story. Inspiring example of how to survive physical and emotional challenges. The wilderness story rings true. This is an engaging and entertaing adventure.
4,OK,"Hatchet was a good book- except that it was slightly far-fetched, it lacked good dialogue, and kept on using repeating words. On the good side, it showed a great story of survival in hardship. Hope you enjoy/dislike this book!"
4,A Classic,"Hatchet by Gary Paulsen, is about a thirteen year old boy named Brian whose plane crashes in the woods while heading to his dad's house. He is the only one left alive from the crash, and all he has to survive is a hatchet that his mother gave to him. During his visit with nature, he runs into several obstacles. Whether he is trying to not starve, keep warm or protect himself from wild animals, he must survive. This book is a pretty good read. It makes you hunger for more. Perfect for school age kids to young adults."
4,very well written,"As an adult, I enjoyed this book, and so did my 9 year old son. Very well written and definitely keeps you hooked until the end!"
3,Good book,"This was a good book. I gave it 3 stars only because it was a very easy read. I would recommend it , especially to a young adult"
5,THIS WAS A GREAT BOOK!,Brian Robinson is on a plane and it crashes. He has to learn to survive in the wilderness. This book was great because of the suspense. It is really great.
4,A brilliant adventure series for all boys,"This book dragged you into the atmosphere of the incredible tale.The story is one that all children would be indulged in .The book was filled with action packed and breath taking adventures.All boys my age will find it hard to put this novel down and would be intreged with the different aspects of his struggle for survival such as facing a tornado , encountouring many different attacks by fearsome animals. You would be suprised how even building a fire or a simple weapon is a great mission . I really recomend this novel to serious and young adventure seekers !!"
2,"A Quick Read, But Not a Good One","I read this book for an AR (accelerated reader) book in my class. My friend had very much enjoyed this book so I gave it a try. It was my displeasure throughout the whole book reading it. I found the story-line boring, and all the events timed poorly. One thing I did like about it was the poem like one-word sentences throughout some of the book."
4,Hatchet,"I thought hatchet by Gary Pulsen was a very decient piece of writing. I was never bored with the book but never was blown away. It uses detail to discribe many challenges Brian faces. Like using a bow and arrow to hunt fish and game. It is not a novel that will keep you on the edge of your seat, but it will keep you reading."
5,This was the best book I ever read.,I give this book five stars. It's about a thirteen year old boy named Brian. He is flying to see his father. All these thoughts are going through his mind because his father and mother are divorced and he knows why. Read it and find out what happens.
5,This is a must-read book!,"I'm now in 5th grade.We just finished reading this book. In this book a 13-year old, Brian Robeson's parents divorce. His father moves to the Canadian wilderness. Brian goes to visit his father, but while on the plane ride there, the pilot has a heart attack. Brian does not know how to fly a plane, and as a result crashes into the lake. He has to survive for 54 days. Do you think he'll get rescued? Read the book to find out!"
2,Okay,"I picked up this book thinking it would be one of my all time favorites considering its good reputation. I was very dissapointed. I am not the one to read "" survival"" stories. But, this book was terrible."
5,Hatchet is one of the most popular books in our library!,"""Hatchet"" has consistently been one of the most popular adventure books in our elementary school library since it was published. It is often the first book to get boys hooked on reading, however girls like it, too!""Hatchet"" is part of a great tradition of survival stories like, ""My Side of the Mountain,"" ""Island of the Blue Dolphins,"" ""Call it Courage,"" ""The Sign of the Beaver,"" ""The Iceberg Hermit,"" ""The Cay,"" ""Incident at Hawk's Hill,"" and ""Julie of the Wolves.""Highly recommended."
4,Lynden High Freshman,"Hatchet, Gary Paulson, 1987It takes place in the Canadian wilderness and it is by a lake in the shape of an L. Brian, he is 13 and he likes girls. He is the main character. Along with the Plane driver and his Mom and Dad. Important points are live like a new man; he made a fire; his mom is the one who gave him the hatchet and it has helped... I did not expect him to find and eat all the turtle eggs and eat them raw... that was sick... I recommend the book to all yall it is fun and exciting."
4,A wonderful book for the Young Adult Literature world.,"Gary Paulsen's Hatchet is a wonderful addition to classrooms. This book would probably serve well in a junior high setting. I read this book when I was in junior high, and again in college for a YAL class. The book is very entertaining and easy to read for the less advanced readers. Paulsen is exceptionally good at introducing more difficult words, and then explaining what those words mean. In this way, he can expand the readers vocabulary without confusing them. The book could also appeal to those with more advanced reading skills, because of it's almost peotic rhythm. The author gives his reader the emotions and background of his characters, and then lets the reader fill in the blanks as to how their own senses would react. I would recommend this book to teachers and parents of students who need to devolope the love of reading."
4,Hatchet was a good book,I am a 7th grader at Mackinaw Trail Middle School. I read Gary Paulsen's Hatchet. I recommend it for a 7th grade level reader. I really liked the plane crash as that was the part I found most interesting. I also liked how he got his food. It was a very good book.
5,Must Read,"This is a great book for all lovers of the outdoors such as myself. I read it when i was young and have just reread it and loved it as much as I did then. Also, check out The Wild Adventures of Eli Johnson and Curly Bill for another exciting read."
5,A great read!,The hatchet. This book is just as amazing as when I read it in school! A real page turner for all ages.
5,:-),"Another purchased for my daughter's 7th grade reading class. I LOVED this adventure story of a boy whose single pilot plane crashes on the way to his parent's house. Fantastic, suspenseful----great book!"
4,"Cornwall, NY, sixth grader",I am a sixth grader. Hatchet was a very good book. I would recommend this book to anyone who like the outdoors and likes to read suspensful books. Brian's Winter is a nice addition to this book.
4,Hatchet,The book Hatchet be Gary Paulsen is an adventurous story about a young boy who gets stranded on an island after a plane crash. The story begins when Brain is on a plane going to visit his father because his parents are divorced. During the flight the pilot has a heart attack and dies. The plane crashes but Brian survives the problem he is stranded to an island and no one where he is. The meaning of this book to me is not how to survive on an island is your plane crashes. It shows how you have to stay strong no matter how difficult life gets. Brian goes through a lot of the same situations most teens got through every day. I think teens like me can learn a lot from this book.
5,A great book,This book was a great no awesome book because it was very enthusiastic. I was able to feel how Brian felt It felt like I was right there next to him the whole time. It was really astonishing. The writer Gary Paulsen is able to make you feel the things that the character feel I would recommend this book to any body who what to feel the adventure of Brian as he does his best to survive the wilderness. :)
3,I liked it.,It was a good book. I liked how he survived and it seems like this is real person. The beginning with the pilot was kind of disturbing but it was not violent.
5,Excellent for the whole family,My three children ages 7 through 12 just loved this audio book. They were thoroughly engaged through the whole story! Excellent use of imagery. The life lessons and morals taught in the story are well needed in todays world.
2,Hatchet review,"OK but not as good as Touching Spirt Bear. I thought the author just got tired of writng and decided ""lets save the kid and end the book"". To anyone who has to read the book please note that while the hatchet plays an important role in his survival there is something even more valuable that Brian has with him."
1,HE GETS ATTACKED BY MOOSE!,"This book was bad. Don't read it, because it's just plain stupid, and would not amuse someone who is 3 months old (if they could understand it)."
1,Hatchet Review,I disliked this book because it wasn't really action-packed. It was too much about survival and nothing exciting really happened except a few major parts. I wouldn't recomend this book to kids who like mystery or action and adventure.
1,WARNING: DO NOT READ,"This was the worst book of all time. Seriously, Arthur books are better than this. It was soooooo boring. All it is about is a guy who gets stranded in the woods. Dippity doo dog. I mean , COME ON!, one whole chapter is dedicated to the guy going fishing. And really its not that interesting. Personally, this book would not be an interesting book to read and as you can see I did not like it. Also, I would like to add, that this book was sooooooo boring that me and my friend read it together, like one person read the first half and one person read the second half, and I had to put post-it notes in after every chapter to remember what was going on and do you know what? I DIDNT EVEN FINISH IT!!!!!!"
1,"PLease, no","I had to read this for school. i read a lot of books and this is probably the worst thing i ever read. it could have been three pages long if there werent so many details. anyway, what are the chances of breaking ribs after beng attacked by a moose and then sleeping through a tornado?"
1,WORST BOOK EVER,I had to read this book for school and I almost fell asleep reading it! THE PLOT MAKES NO SENSE!
5,"""Hatchet"" The Best Book Ever","I think Hatchet is the best book the Gary Paulsen ever wrote. I think that because this book Hatchet won a newberry honor book.This book has everything a book needs because it has adventure, I cant say anything else because you have to read Hatchet for yourself to believe me. If you read Hatchet it will change your life like it changed mine because the main charactor Bryan has to survive on the island that he lands on well he actually crahses on because his pilot had got a heart attack and thats what he had to do to survive or else he would have landed in the ocean and had a watery grave. I recommend this book to anybody that likes to read."
4,It was really great and the whole way through it was tense.,"The Hatchet was a great story that, although I read it a while ago now, I can still distinctly remember what a great story it was. It was a story that kept you interested for ages, I could not put it down, like many other books, because there was always something new on every page that would change the story dramatically."
3,A Great Tool For A Great Mind,"This story takes place in 1988, in the Canadian Wilderness a very exiting setting. Most of this story place in that area. The Canadian Wilderness has caused him to starve. It has caused him to grow skinny and fragile it made him into a new person a new Brian Robeson.This story is mostly about a young man by the name of Brian Robeson. A troubled young man and it all happened because of the secret. It all happened when plane flew out of control and crashed in the Canadian Wilderness leaving him to deal with the dangerous wilderness. Now he's just trying to survive.In my opinion this book is truly a disappointment. I hope you agree with me. The ending was good but, it did not change my mind. I would no recomened this book because it's a boring book readers would not want to read."
4,Hatchet Review,"The book hatchet is a great book that recommend to kids. This book is a book about a boy name Brian who is visiting his father.On the way to his father the airplane crashed. The only thing he has with him was a hatchet that his mother gave him.The things I like about this book is that if you don't know any survival techniques,you can read about this book and find out about what your suppose to do.This book is one book that I really enjoy reading.This book has its own challenges or obstacles as you read.But at the end its surprising the way he acted towards all that happened to him.I recommend this book to kids who are into books that like about survival."
4,a book lover,My teacher read this to me in the 6th grade. A few monhs ago I reread it (now an adult). I it is really a good book. Better for those in Middle school then adult but truly entertaining.
5,It was great!,It was a great book.I was reading it in class and but was not soppose to go ahead. I couldn't stop. I got in trouble but it was deffenitly worth it!
5,Hatchet,I think Hatchet is one of the BEST books I have EVER read. It has realistic points mixed with adventurous points to make the book an Edge - of - Your - Seat - Can't - Put - The - Book - Down novel.. Paulsen is a tremendous writer!!
3,The Adventure,"Brian's dad and mom had just divorced. Brian was going to go visit his dad. Brian took a plane to his house. Not long after the plane took off the piolot had a heart attach and the plane crashed.When it crashed he had a little black-out. When he woke up he was in pain, but he went for help, food ,and water. The only thing that he could find was some turtle eggs. Brian picked up one and ate one. They were so good to him that he at some more. Brian was stuck there for a couple of days. But not to long because a helicopter came down and rescued him. The helicopter went and took him to his dad's house. I think that this book was preety good but it was also sad and that's why I gve it three stars."
5,love it,When Brian Robeson is strabded out jn the Canadian woods he has two big options life or death Brian must learn how to survive jn the woods after an unexpected events tuen to the worst. I think anybody would like this book it has survival skills aciton and much more so i recomend you buy it
4,Hatchet by Gary Paulsen,"Hatchet by gary paulsen.I am doing this review for a book project in my english class. I picked this book because I always hear people talking about how good it is. So I decided to find out for myself weather it is good or not. I'm not really big on reading so not to many books intrest me but when I read the first page of this book it had my full attention and I did not want to put it down. The first chapter is full of action and excitement. Throughout this book a thirteen year old boy tries to survive with very few supplies. Luckly for him though it is summer and not winter. He has a hatchet that his mother gave him and a few more supplies from the plane.I'm not going to spoil the rest of the book for the people who have not read this action, thriller book. If you are reading this review and have not red this book I highly advise you to read this book."
4,Hatchet,I read this book when I was a child and felt it should be a must read for my boys. Very good story and keeps you interested on every chapter. Hope my boys like it as much as I did.
4,Hatchet,"The book Hatchet was a great book. I thouht the book was going to be boring but it got better at the end. It was about a boy who was going to see his dad. My favorite part was when Brian was trying to help the pilot. Then something happened that was sad. The end of the book was good. The boy was missing in the wilderness, they may find him and they may not find him. Read the book Hatchet to see what happens."
4,jordans review,It is a very interesting book. It tells how a boy is left on a plane when the pilot dies from a hardattack and has to land it in a lake. He crashes and is left with nothing but a hatchet.I like this book because it gives you alot of details
5,this muct be the best book ever!!!!!,i think it is a great book first of all.and second of all he gets stuck in the wilderness with only a hatchet. third he comes dows with a crashing plane and im sure thats where you will get in to this book.thats where i did i didnt stop one day that is a good book. and from there you can tell that this will be a good book.he has to find a way out before the wilderness kills him over time.what you will have to find out is will he come out alive or dead?
4,Survival,"This is a book about survival!! This is a story about a young boy who crashed in an airplane left in the remote wilderness to fend for himself. He finds out things about his inner self and his own strength. There is only an internal monologue in this book, the book is contemplative and only reveals his true thoughts about this situation or the other and is told in the third person narrative. Interesting to see a book that is just one person thinking inside his own head and not talking to anyone out loud."
5,excellent,this is a very good book. i recomed it to any one and every one. hatchet is the best book ever!
5,Hatchet the best book ever!!!!!!! by Jill Marianacci,"Dear Reader,Have you ever read Hatchet? Well I have and it is a great book. Here is something about it.When Brian Robeson was in a plane about to see his father the pilot had a heartattack andleaves Brian to defend by himself.Then he lands the plane on the L part of the lake. Andall he has to pertect himself is his hatchet.Hatchet is a fun,heartwarming and chilling story. It makes you think you think twiceand read it now."
4,An Awesome book!!!!!!!!!! Hatchet,"Hatchet was a wonderful book to read because it descibed tons of things. YOu don't have any questions about it. Funny and scary parts are in this nook. Hatchet is about alittle boy about 12 to 13 years old and he is going to see his dad in Canda, Brian the little boyis stuck somewhere in Canda. He crashed in a plane and somehow survived.But what happend to the pilot, well that's for me to know and you to go read the book Hatchet and find out. Go now and read Hatchet."
4,Son loved the book.,"I read this book to my son...he loved the adventure part of the story that I read tohim. It tells about a young teen, Brian, who survives a plane crash and then must surviveon his own in the wilderness. Brian's parents were recently divorced and he was on his way to visit his father when the plane crash occurs. Throughout the book there were some references to a secret that Brian knew (his mother committing adultery). I left those parts out because I didn't think an [...] needed to hear those details. He loves the outdoors and survival themes so I knew he would like this book...and he did!"
4,"A good book, full of excitement!","This is a great book, especially for older children. It left me, an adult in my thirties, entertained & captivated. I had to stop myself at times from glancing ahead to see what would happen next. I am an outdoor enthusiast & enjoy books about survival. Although some of the book's premise seemed highly unlikely, I was left curious to whether or not it was a true story by the end."
1,A Very Bad and Boring book,"Although I never got past chapter 8 in this book, the part that I did read was very bad and unrealistic. There is a very slim chance that the pilot would have a heart attack on a plane, and then Brian Robeson, the main character, would actually be able to fly the plane at all. Then there would be an even slimmer chance that anyone would survive a crash of such greatness where a wing broke off and the plane crashing into the lake, and then swimming out. Furthermore, I don't like this book because of the odd survival skills that Brian uses during the part that I read. I would not suggest this book to anyone."
1,dull as can b,this was the WORST book i have ever read. it was so completely boring and dragged on forever. i wouldn't have finished the book had it not been for school.
4,Hatchet,"The book Hatchet is about a 13 years old name Brian Robenson. The story tells about how Brian got lost in the woods in Canada. There Brian learns how to survive and live on his own with nothing but the hatchet that his mom gave him. If you would like to know more about the book Hatchet, you should definitely read this book because it's a great book.Vang Lor"
4,Paulsen writes to naturalists,"The beginning is very exciting, the ""secret"" and then the plane crash. I really liked the detail in this story. The animal sounds, experiences, and descriptions really helped me feel Brian's hunger, his pain, and his day to day nature experiences. The ending was a surprise, too. I would recommend that you read it!"
4,A really good adventure book,"My friend loves Gary Paulsen books so I read it because she wanted me too. I was really surprised at the quality! It used really good descriptions and didn't glorify the disasters. Brian had troubles, a lot of them, and HE had to find ways around them. It is a pretty easy read but a good one none the less-give it a try!"
4,Good book for kids,"I first read this book in 6th (or 7th grade). I liked it at the time, it was pretty good. I'd recomend this to anyone looking for a pretty good book for either entertainment or book report."
5,The Out Hook of Out Doors!,"BuIf you like adventuresome books, you should read this one. This book is about a boy who is on a plane and the pilot has a heart attack. Brian the 13 year old boy, struggles to survive in the woods out in the middle of nowhere. But sure enough with first aid, he survives the wild adventure! If you like books with adventure, I recommend you to read this book. I recommend people with the crave for adventure, You should read ""Hatchet."""
4,HATCHET,"THIS WAS A VERY INTERESTING BOOK IT WAS VERY GOOD WITH GOOD USE OF LANGUAGE. IT DOESNT TAKE LONG TO READ WHICH IS QUITE A GOOD THING AS MOST PEOPLE AT MY AGE DONT ENJOY READING. I WOULD RECOMEND THIS BOOK TO ANY BODY ESPECIALLY BOYS AS IT IS A BOYISH BOOK . ITIS A BOY WHO PLAYS A BIG PART IN IT. WHY NOT READ IT YOURSELF!!!GEORGE STARK, FORTH"
3,Hatchet,"My opinion on this book to me anyway was great!!! I had fun reading it!! There was a lot of adventure, excitement, and encouraging for me to read. Every page had excitement in it. I thought the book was neat becauese if you got lost you would know how to survive. That was the best book I had read in so long!!!!!"
1,TERRIBLY BORING!!!!!,This book is just about the worst book I hve ever read in my life. The sequence of events is dull and extremly predictable. Don't read this book if you have a choice.
1,Overrated and gross!!,"I just read this book that my 9-year-old read in public school. I cannot believe this book is a Newbery Honor book. I cannot believe this book is actually encouraged to be read. (My son said the teacher played an audio introduction to the book, and if they wanted to continue reading it on their own they could.) Not even halfway through the book, the boy named Brian has vomited three times and almost a fourth (is this really necessary?). Also, about halfway through, 13-year-old Brian begins to despair that he will ever be saved so he takes his hatchet and begins cutting his arm to try and end it all. Nothing like teaching our children how to despair and attempt suicide! This book is in no way a positive moral example of great literature. If you would like to read something that is, I highly suggest ""Island of the Blue Dolphins"" by Scott O'Dell rather than this trash. Beautifully written and much more worth your time."
1,I'd rather read a dictionary,"Brian's story of survival seemed interesting...at first. The story dragged out at an indescribably slow pace and was rather like reading a telephone book, or dictionary. The author repeated words to give them more meaning, and to help you feel Brians pain and yearning for his old life, which was nice, the first few times. It became extremely repetitive and made the reading unenjoyable. I would certainly not recommend this read to anyone at all."
1,This Book Deserves an Award-Biggest Waste of Time Ever Spent,"What a horrible, boring, time wasting concoction of cardboard, paper, glue, and stupidity. This book is among the worst I've ever read. It would have been okay if it had what it needs most: a point. Spare yourself, forget this bore of a read!"
1,Not a Good Book,"Brian kept on using the ""Secret"". Paulsen could've left that out. I didn't like his style of writing. Some details went a little far on plucking a bird and having the guts come out, etc."
4,cornwall ny 6th grade,i am a 6th grader. I think the book hatchet was a great book. it had great parts and tips on how to survive in the wilderness. Bryan had to face many dangers in his quest to find his father. I would rate this book with ****.
5,Very Good Book,"This book is mainly for the out doors type because, it is mainly about A boy who crash lands in the wilderness for A year. The boy not only learns to live in the wild but, to connect to the outdoors. I would recomend this book greatly to all people who have ever been camping. I thought this book was one of the easiest books I have ever read. Over all I thought this was a very fun and interesting book."
5,Teachers love Hatchet!,"Brian Robeson, a thirteen-year old boy, is traveling to visit his father who was recently divorced from Brian's mother. The small plane he travels in crashes, killing the pilot and leaving Brian as the only survivor in the Canadian wilderness. The book documents his struggle for survival and dealing with his emotions.Hatchet remains one of my favorite children's books-one that I felt compelled to read every spare minute until finished. Teachers continually laud this book not only for it's enjoyable reading, but for its many themes-divorce, survival, courage, resourcefulness, determination, confidence, self-esteem. It's also a great learning tool to teach different reading comprehension strategies."
5,This book is freakin' awsome!,This book tells about brian's crash and how he has to survive in the wildernes.This book is awsome!
5,A grate book about survival,This book is about a [...]boy who's parents got divorced and now he isFlying to his dad's house for the summer. But the pilot has a hart attract. And nowBrian has to fly the plane and crashes. This book is the most described book IEver read. This book is mystery in a way because you never know what is going to happen. :Hailey
4,It's Very Good,"Hatchet This is a book a about a boy named Brian, who has just suffered his parents' splitting up and getting a divorce. The first summer that he has to go to his dads', his mother gives him a hatchet as a going away present. While he is in the small plane, the pilot unexpectedly suffers a massive heart attack and dies. As the plane goes into the Canadian woods, Brian must think of a away to survive the crash, and to my astonishment, he does. The rest of the book is about how this city-slicker boy survives in the wild with nothing but the clothes on his back and a hatchet. This book gives people who live in cities a good look into what it would be like to live by themselves in the wild and have no one with whom to talk. It also gave me a flash into the Stone Age. I could see how much we take modern technology for granted that they did not have in the Stone Age. For example, if you were to trip or stumble on a rock and break a leg there would be no mode"

4,Motivating for all ages,"I read this book because my daughter's 5th grade class is reading it. The story is of a young boy who is thrown into the wild, and must learn to depend on himself. Excellent narrative, and empowering in its message. Highly recommended!"

2,It was thrilling!,"I thought this book was was boring in a lot of parts, but it was a interesting book.The best part was when the plane crashed in the lake."
4,This book was about survival in the forest.,"Brian was boy who lived a normal 90's life in the city, until he went to go to visit his dad. On a small plane he traveled, but when almost there they crashed and he was stranded by himself. All he had was his hatchet."
4,Good book,It's a good book for its size. I enjoyed reading it and would recommend this book for whoever enjoys action and adventure.
2,Definitely a kids book,"I read this and thought, ""I could have written this book"". Pretty basic, not very creative. Seems like a story my Grandfather would have made up on the fly when we asked him for a bedtime story."
5,A great book,I thought Hatchet was a great book.It evolved real life problems that Brian solved in many unique ways.If you like outdoors you will really like this book.It was the best book i have ever read.
4,A Pretty Good Book,"I think this book was good because it had a plot that went well with it's character. The only thing I didn't like about it was the fact that it was based on only 1 character (Except the bear, who didn't do anything anyway)."
5,Kasey's Review,"This book Hatchet is about a kid Brian who gets trapped in the wilderness and has to survive. This teaches him how to hunt and fish, how to make a fire, and basically how to survive. He also faces injuries, severe weather and a few more things, but you have to read to find that out.I would give this book 2 thumbs up. I really like this book because there were so many cliff hangers and if you like cliff hangers, you would like this book. I suggest you read this book."
4,HACHET,"VERY AWSOM! I READ IT VERY FAST VERY SOON A DAY YES! TRUTH IT WAS A GOOD BOOK, I HAD READ IT TWICE AS A YOUTH IN MY TEENAGE, BUT I READ IT AGAIN AM NOW A LOT OLD, I SAY THIS IS STILL VERY GOOD EXAMPLARY BOOK OF CHILD LITERTURE. TAUGHT ME ALOT. I RECOMEND AND HIGHLY. THANK YOU."
4,Warning! This book is totaly irisistible!,"Hachet by Gary Paulsen is a realistic fiction book with a interesting character named Brian Robenseon.This 13 year old boy finds himself in the Canadian wilderness with nothing but his clothes and a hatchet.He was travelling to his father's house in a bushplane when the pilot dies of a heart-attack.Brian amazingly survives the crash.Can he endure porcupine quills, mosquitoes and worst of all tornadoes?I would recommend this book to anyone who likes vivid adventurous stories I would also recommend Brian's Winter, a continuation of Hatchet.I think Hatchet is one of Gary Paulsen's best books."
4,Very Enjoyable book,"Gripping story - a little scary at first, but my 10-year old did fine with it and the book really held our attention."
4,What An Adventure,"Hatchet is a great book for fourth graders. It was veryinteresting because on every page there was a new adventure for BrianRobeson. On a trip to see his dad, the small plane crashed in the L Shaped Lake. Brian made it to shore safely but had to survive in the Canadian wilderness with only a hatchet, which his mom had given him. I recommend this exciting book to everyone."
3,Hatchet,"The main character is Brian Roberson. He is thirteen years old. His parents were divorced. He was going to visit his father. The pilot of the plane died and the plane crashed. Now Brian is alone in the forest. Brian tries to do everything to keep him alive. He catches the fish. Brian makes a fire. He builds the shelter. He every time was to talk with him self. He feels like he is adult. He was there for 54 days.Hatchet is survival a book. In the book are a lot of hard words. I think this book is boring. I didn't like to read this book. There wasn't a lot of action. I like, stories where there are a lot of actions.I did like the main character Brian, because he is a strong person. He thinks, about how to survive without being scared. He always think before he does something."
3,Hatchet,"I started injoying this book in the fourth chapter because excitment was wild in my mind. I would have givin it four stars a year ago but now I have read many books. For a seven or eight year old, hey even for someone who likes to read, I recomend this book.Llywellyn"
5,Kept my attention,"The story is about a 13 year old boy who survives a plane crash in the Canadian wilderness. I really enjoyed listening to this tape. It kept my attention because it seemed like something new -- sometimes exciting, sometimes scarey, was happening to him. Brian has to deal with finding food and surviving in the wilderness with wild animals. I recommend listening to this story on the tape because while listening to it, you are picturing this adventure in your mind."
4,"Martha's Review of ""Hatchet""","Hatchet is a story about a child named Brian. He is going to visit his dad in the Canadian oilfields. While Brian is flying there, the pilot dies from a massive heart attack. Brian takes over the controls. He flies the plane until it runs out of gas, and then crash lands in a lake shaped like an ""L"". He somehow survives the crash. Does Brian survive in the wilderness? Read the book to find out. This book is for readers who like adventures."
2,Scratch it Hatchet,"""Hatchet"" by Gary Paulson is just an OK book. Hatchet is a book about a boy named Brian who is 13. He is going to his Dad's home in Canada. His Mom gives him a hatchet and he leaves on the plane. The pilot has a heart attack and Brian has to take control of the plane. The plane runs out of gas and crashes into a lake. Brian survives the crash but does he survive the wilderness? You'll have to read the book to find out... It is supposed to be realistic, but doesn't come off realistically. By the end of the story, I thought it might actually be fun to be lost and living off the land.The style of the writing bothered me too. The author repeats things like ""Secret, the secret"". It gets really annoying. I say don't buy it, it's not worth it!"
5,"An exciting, real life adventure book for boys.","Brian a young troublesome city boy crashed in the Canadian wilderness after the pilot had a fatal heart attack. He was only left with his hatchet, that his mother gave him before he left the airport,which he uses to survive. Finding out the streangths mother nature going through a hurricane. The animals played a vital part in his survival.He learns to make new tools and how to use them.He goes through many adventures and experiences new concepts that he would not have learned in the city. This is an exciting adventure book which we recommend you to read."
3,A good class adventure novel,Hatchet is an imaginitive vibrent tale of survival in which a 13 year old boy is stranded in the Canadian woods with nothing to survive with but a small hatchet.It is a discriptive piece of writing which accuratly portrays the enviroment that Brian had to survive in.He had to face many difficulty and dangers.He also had to find food and found that a little hard in the begining but soon got used to catching fish and birds.He also got over two of his main problems and they were depression and the devorce of his parents. Muhammad Desai
3,A thrilling tail of a boy traped in the Canadian willderness,"This is a thrilling tail of a boy named Brian who after he sufferd a plain crash , has to survive against all the beasts and and dangers of the wilderness.The characters are very good accsept he gave to little detail on them.The book also gives yu a breef summary of how it feels to have parents who have just been divorced. It has many morals to it but you have to read it to find out .Although it gets boring some times because it gives to much detail in the scenerny. It is a breath tacking experience to read this book and I suggest you get down and read it."
2,the book was too long,The book Hatchet is about a boy who survives a plane crash. He has only his cloths he is wearing and a hatchet he got from his mom who he now dislikes because of her secret meetings with a white haired man. Brian was on his way to visit his divorced father. Brian was sitting in the co-pilots seat when the pilot had a heart attack. Brian had to land the plane! Brian had to land in the lake and swim out How will he survive?.
5,hatchet was the best book I ever read.,It was a great story about survival in the wilderness. Hatchet was one of the best books bt Gary Paulsen.
4,Alone in The Wilderness,"In my opinion this was a really good book, but not the best book I've ever read. This book shows how a boy (Brian) is living through the Canadian Wilderness after a plane crash. It is an amazing story about how some movies and books about survival are nowhere near real life situations. This book is great for outdoorsy people and people that love the wilderness. But I am not that kind of person so that's why I only gave the book a 4 star rating. But if you want to find out what happens to Brian who is alone in the wilderness then read Hatchet."
4,In The Woods Alone,I think this book is one of the best that I have ever read. The reason is because it tells a story of a boy that is trying to go see his father in the Canadain oil fields and on the way there the small plane crashes. Brain is force to live by himself and face challenges that await him. I would recommend this book to everyone and especially to young readers that like adventure book. On a scale from 1 to 10 I would rate this book a 9.5. If you want to find more about this book go to your book store.
4,Hatchet,"Hatchet is a good book and very adventurous. I rated a 4 star becuase I think its a really good outdoor book but the book seems so long to read it. It must of been hard for Brian trying to live in the forest. Must of hurt when he got attack by a animal. I think this book will be good for someone who really loves the outdoor and nature. Hatchet is a very good book because the author makes it sound like your there in the forest with Brian. So to conclude, this is a really good interactive book."
3,Hatchet,"I like how it talks about the woods and how he survived in spite of the many hardship he faced. This book excels as a survival story, I especially liked the scene when the mad moose attached Brian and when the tornado hit his shelter. I was really curious to know how he handled this situation and the author explains this very well. I did not give this book the highest rating because it is slow moving and I am not really too fond of survival stories."
3,Hatchet,"Christina Phillips 3/28/07Writing Book ReviewHatchetHatchet is a book about a thirteen year old boy.His name is Brian. Brian was on his way to see his dad during the summer. Instead Brian got into a plane crash. I think this was a bad thing because Brian was not able to see his father. The reason that the pilot and Brian got in the plane crash was because the pilot lost control of the plane. I think this book is very sad because the pilot dies from a very serious heart attack just like my grandfather did. Brian lived in the wilderness for a while.After about two months the searchers stopped looking for Brian because they thought that he had possibly died but he didn't, he was still alive. To find out if Brian makes it home you have to read the book. I recommend this book to people who like to read extraordinary books because you have to have a lot of patients to read this book."
4,Hatchet,The book Hatchet is an adventurous book about who stranded on an island. The story begins when Brian is takeing a plane to go see his father because him parents a divorced. During the flight the piolt has a heart attack and dies. The plane crashes and Brian survies but is stranded on an islad. He learns how to use nature to help him survive. The meaning of this book to me was not to show how to survive on an islad if your plane crashes. It shows how to be strong no matter how difficlut life gets. Brian goes through a lot of the same situations most teens go through every day. I think teen like me can learn a lot from this book.
4,Hatchet,The book Hatchet by Gary Paulsen is an awesome book. I read this book recently and I was so into the book that I couldn't stop reading! In the beginning a teen named Brian was on board a plane to go see his father. During the ride the pilot had a sudden heart attack and dies. The plane goes out of control and Brian is left stranded on an island with only a hatchet and his will to survive. Will Brian make it through to see his dad before summer ends?
4,"Cornwall, New York, sixth grader",I am a sixth grader. I liked this book. I liked this book because it gave you tips how to survive in the wilderness. I thought it was very interesting how Brian encountered the animals he faced. This was a very good book.
2,"good, but not too good","I had to read this book for a school project, and let's just say it was pretty bad. I've read many better survival stories that were a little more realistic than this. But, Hatchet has taught me a lesson: Pay attention to all that's around...you'll never know when you'll end up in a situation like Brian's."
4,Newberry Winner???,"Hatchet was a good book don't get me wrong, but a Newberry Award Winner?!?!? It did lack detail and could be quite dull at times, but at some parts you couldn't stop reading! Its a very imaginative book but in my opinion it isn't to realistic! I mean c'mon a kid who has no experience takes over a plane and crashes it into a lake beautiffly?!?!? Yah, that happens everyday! Oh yah and that ending, weak!!!"
4,Hatchet,"Your're alone, scared and trapped in the Canadian wilderness, no-one to help you, all you've got are clothes and a Hatchet. Would you commit suicide, or would you fight for survival?This is what Brian, a 13 year-old boy has to do to live, and he is trapped, alone and hungry...""Hatchet"" is a fantastic read for all ages, a book that makes YOU want to live too."
2,Suspenseful...Not,"I had to read Hatchet in 6th grade and it was so boring. Every chapter I was waiting for something to happen. Nothing ever did. The story is very predictable. Man gets on island, man makes fire, man gets saved. This story is just like the movie ""Cast Away"", except instead of the man talking to a volleyball, Bryan talks to himself. What's the chance of your pilot having a heart attack, then you somehow land on a island, make fire, and survive 45 days in the wilderness? 1/1000. This book got 2 stars from me because the end played in well with all the dullness. This is like Maury, he always plays the same show more that once. But this time, Paulsen's show never got on TV. I suggest this book to old people who like action movies but not the books. I beg your pardon Gary Paulson. You are a great author. What went wrong?"
5,Paint with Words,"Gary Paulsen ""paints with words"" as he writes a descriptive story about a fifteen year old boy contending with his parent's divorce. This book is rivoting. The reader wants to read on as a young boy learns through discovery about how to survive in the Canadian wildernes. I read this book to my students and they were lined up in the library to check out Gary Paulsen books. Gary Paulsen writes passionately with no holes barred, which is what makes the story believable, exciting and compelling."
4,Survival!!!,A fast read for those who like to imagine what it would be like to crash in the wild! Fast paced with lots of adventure and tips for survival!
3,Eh,It was ok the beginning was a bit slow but as it exalted it got more interesting as he was trying to survive at about the eighth charizard i got into it
3,Prepare yourself,The plight of Brian Robeson could work as a cautionary tale for any teenage explorers. A good exercise for mental preparedness!
3,Rather decent for the most part,"Brian Robeson, a 13 year-old boy, has found himself in a situation that could end in life or death aboard a Cessna aircraft flying over the Canadian wilderness...Gary Paulsen, the author of the adventure/survival novel, Hatchet did a wonderful job detailing, narrating, and sculpting a picture in my mind, for the most part.The reason I say this is because I feel Gary Paulsen just gave up on the book towards the end. Gary Paulsen gets into a rather decent part in the book and seems to get tired of writing then ends extremely abruptly. He never touched back on the secret between his divorced parents. Gary Paulsen is a great writer, but ending a book is not really his thing. Hatchet is great in detail, and has a surprising plot, but it does not have very many characters, and good information on the main character. I would recommend this book if you like a quick book with a slow going plot and a unique story."
4,Very Interesting Book,"Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen, is a survival book that I would recommend for ages 8 and up because some parts of the book can get a little gory. The main character of the book is Brian Robeson, an average kid with divorced parents and a secret. I would describe the plot as fast paced, exciting, mind blowing and surprising. Most of the setting of the book takes place in the Canadian wilderness.In my opinion, the conclusion of the book starts out very interesting and detailed. Gary Paulsen unexpectedly ends the book, in my opinion. This is a great book for everybody, especially if you love action and detail. I think what is unique about the book is the author's writing style and point of view. They're like a cross between a journal entry and a narrator. Over all, I thought Hatchet was a good book."
1,bad book,I would have given this zero stars but the site woulden't let me. when i read the book my mind felt like it was going to explode . when you read this...actually dont
1,Ended too soon.,"I was forced to read this book in school and I hated it. It's about a boy who is haunted by his parents divorce and is going to see his father and his plane crashes when the pilot died. I thought it really neede more characters and it is no way for 9 year olds[he tries to commit suicide]. Brian has to survive alone in the wilderness and overcome depression. If you like survival books, I guess you'd like it."
1,THIS IS THE SUCKIEST BOOK EVER!! DO NOT READ!!!,"This book was SOOOOOOOO boooring. It was so bad, that I had to put post it notes telling me what was going on when I fininshed a chapter. DANGER!!! IF YOU READ THEN YOUR MIND WILL BE POISENED. THIS IS THE WORST BOOK ON THE MARKET!!!!!!!!"
2,mistake,"My son needed this book for school. We had already taken it out of the library over the summer and read it, but then I realized that he needed a copy to use at school. I had already done this once before and received a beautiful perfect condition old library book so I figured I do it again. Mistake. This book turned out to be a very old copy. None of the pages matched up with the newer edition. In a panic the other night I ended up buying the book on my Ipad because I needed to find vocabulary words on specific pages. Bottom line, I tried to save money and it ended up costing more than just buying a normal new book. You don't know what you're getting and that's a problem."
2,hatchet,I didn't like Hatchet because it was so boring. All that you did was read about a kid sitting around.I think it was a poorly written book.It was a waste of my time.You shouldn't read it becouse its too long.
4,A very good book,"The book ""Hatchet"" is a book, where you don't always know what's going to happen. If you want a book that gets more and more intersting, Hatchett is the book for you."
4,A review of Hatchet,"Hatchet is a realistic fiction story. Gary Paulsen's vivid language allows readers to feel as though they are with Brian on his adventure in the wilderness. Brian is a very realistic character that struggles in nature in the same way that any teenager would when abandoned in the woods alone. His resourcefulness and intelligent ideas help him to survive the very grimmest of circumstances. This story is told in the third person. This allows Paulsen to explain what Brian is doing, and yet he still shares what Brian is thinking as he lives through this experience."
4,A GOOD BOOK,I think hatchet was a very good book and one of few books I actualy got in to. It made me feel like I was there with Brian. The book made me think about being stranded in the wilderness differently than I would have before I read the book. I would recomend this book to anyone who likes the outdoors or just likes to read.
2,It was o.k.,"I think the thing that I don't like most about this book is that it only has one character through mostlt the whole book. I like books that have a lot of characters and diolouge. Other than that the book was preety much, O.K."
4,Adventure about surviving in The wild,"The title of my book is Hatchet, by Garey Pulsen. The book is about a boy, Brian, who crashes in a plane. The pilot is dead, so Brian is stranded in the wilderness with his only possession, a hatchet. The genre of the book is survival. A person who would like this book is someone who would like a good adventure or survival story. In the course of my author's life, he has written several fabulous novels. One is The Winter Room, another is Hatchet, or Brian's Winter. Those are only a few. When he wrote these books, he lived in New Mexico. One reason why readers would like this book is it is a book action, adventure story. A really good scene in this book is when the plane is crashing. Another reason why readers would like this book is because it has good description of things. Like when the plane crashes, or where the book describes the forest."
5,"If you enjoy Newberry Honors, then this is a must read.","When Brian gets stuck in the wilderness, I near lost my heart when he recalled everything that would have prevented it. The Secret, the Crash, the Pilot. This is the best ""survival story"" I have ever read. This is one of my suggestions for those out there looking for that perfect book on the book shelf..."
5,Wonder in the woods,"As a young readier it is hard to get hooked into a good book by just looking at the cover. This is a book that has been around and i would highly recommend this book for any level readier, even those who are not strong and regular readers. Has it all Strong imagery, fantastic story line, and easy to follow events. This book will keep you on the edge of your set and asking for more."
5,My reveiw for Hatchet,"Gary Paulsen's ""Hatchet"" shows what survival in the northern woods really would be like to the reader. This book is great for readers of all ages, and it is just as good as reading a non-fiction book on survival because it shows what really happens when someone is lost in the Canadian woods. The only thing that I disliked about the book was the ending... I won't say anything else, otherwise, I'd ruin the story, but it's still worth reading."
5,It was a good book!,Hatchet is about a boy name Brian. He was 13 years old.His parents were divorced so he was going to see his dad. He was on a plane.The pilot had a heart attack and the plane went down in the wilderness.Will he survive? Read it and find out.
5,Hatchet is my Favorite Book,"Hatchet is my favorite book, this is a book where a boy whos parents are divorced and goes to visit his father and takes a single engine plane and and plane crashed into a river. The pilot suffers a heart attack and dies, the Boy, Brian survives and manages to live in the middle of no where for about a year, The boys mother, gave him a hatchet for his birthday and the hatchet represents life for without it the boy would not have been able to survive. The boy eventully gets rescued and flys back."
4,"A Scoutmaster on Gary Paulson's, &amp;amp;amp;quot; Hatchet&amp;amp;amp;quot;","As a Scoutmaster I am often given the task of introducing young men to the wonders and hazards of the wilderness for their first time. ""Hatchet"" is recommended reading, by this Scoutmaster, for all Scouts. Growing up in rural Kentucky, I spent many a wonderous hour in the Appalachian Foothills and learned to love and respect nature at it's best and worst. I tell my boys that nature rewards knowledge and seldom forgives foolishness or ignorance. Nature is neither cruel or kind; it is what is.&quot;Hatchet&quot; illustrates this superbly. After you finish &quot;Hatchet&quot;, I highly recommend the follow up book, &quot;The River&quot; as well."
4,Hatchet,"We read this book in class. I liked it and am waiting for someone to check in ""The River"" at school. The reason why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars was because it was really gorry. It was a good book and kept me on the edge of my seat. One of the kids in my class kept saying what they would do because they lived in the country, they kept calling him ""city boy"" but I think Brian did a very nice job surviving. Good job Gary Paulson and keep writing those great books."
5,Hatchet,"Hatchet was a good book. I realy liked that book. When I was reading the book it made me feel like I was in the book. There was nothing I disliked in the book. The book taught me lots of suvival skills.In the book Hatchet, the best part of the book was the end. If I had to choose one part that I enjoyed the most, it would probably be when Brian got resqued. This was the most exciting part because Brian was out there so long. I wanted the book to end too.One of the most vivid parts of the book Hatchet was the setting. This was when Brian crashed the plane into the lake that was surrounded by land. He described it so well that I had to stop reading for a minute. The vivid conflict of this book was man against nature. Brian was faced with a lot of dangers by being stranded in the mountain. One example was when he got hit by a porcupine. He told us in so much description that I thought my leg got hit by a porcupine."
2,Hatchet,"When I read Hatchet I thought it was quite boring. The ending wasn't really good because Bryan kept looking and drooling at food. During this book, Bryan kept on saying he knew ""THE SECRET."" He was always scared of things, so I thought he was a wimp. The book was way too short but it was easy to read. One good thing about the book is that it told you how to survive if you were stranded in the middle of nowhere. The author was Gary Paulsen and some of his books are good, but not this one. I wouldn't read this book if I were you. You will start the book, you'll hear ""THE SECRET,"" and after that you will put the the book down. Overall this book wasn't worth reading."
3,Some events made it hard to love this book,"--- WARNING: SPOILERS ---My 9 year old brought this book home and put it down because he felt it was boring at the start. I suspect (because he's a sensitive kid), he found the notion of divorce and the plane crash hard to read about before bed. So, I picked it up and read it in a few days. I enjoyed the book, but a couple events that occur to the main character are implausible:1. A tornado in the Canadian forest? Not likely. Perhaps the main character mistook high winds for a tornado, but the likelihood either would raise a plane out of the water isn't plausible.2. A moose charges the main character three times and damages his ribs, but the main character is seemingly okay within a couple days of this event.A better book of a child in the outdoors is My Side of the Mountain.- Jon"
3,Read It,"Hatchet by Gary Paulson is a tragic adventure of a young boy named Brian Robeson. Brian Robeson is a fourteen-year-old boy that lives with his mother in northern United States. He is traveling by a Cessna 406 airplane to visit his father. Before leaving the airport, Brian's mother gives him a hatchet that will later save his life. While flying to Canada, the pilot shrieking, ""Chest! Oh God, my chest is coming apart,"" said the pilot. Brian knew now that the he was having a heart attack. The pilot was put to death making Brian crash land the plane in a lake. Brian has been stranded in as southern Canadian forest for about two months. This is not one of my favorite books. I would prefer this book to people that like intense reading. The only bad thing about this book is that Paulson repeats himself a lot. On a scale on one to five, I would give this book a three.---Nick Angell"
2,hatchet-exciteing and boring book,I read hatchet at school because we had to. I found this book to be alright but if i was to go out and buy any book i would not have chosen this one. I think it took a very long time of reading for it to get interesting. Thats why i only rated it with 2 stars.
5,"Hatchet,Gary Palsen",This book is a great book for outdoor adventure people.I haveread the book 4 time enjoying every moment.With the rereading I findnew things all the time. The book is about a boy that is visiting his divorced father that is at an oil drilling field in northern Canada. The small plane crashed following the pilots death from a heart attack. He survives the crash and lay battered on the sand of the lake he crashed in. He finds himself alone with some money and a hatchet he got from his mom as a farewell gift. During his 54 days in the Canadian woods he learns the way of survival and finds a lot of firsts. some firsts were fire brought from sparks and different foods from the woods. This is a fabulous book and I recomend it to everyone.
5,excellent,I think Hachet is one of the best books i've ever read and i've read a few books. But my favirote part of the book were he goes to the airplane when it sank. So he coul'd get the firstaid kit so he had to make a little boat to get out in to the lake. But who would eat turtel eggs. I would get twigs and sticks in stead of buring a hunder dollar bill.By.Jon From Kentucky
4,the best book,this was so good that I gave it four stars. The book kept me on the end of my seat. I gave the book four stars becuase the book was good but it got boaring in some parts. But over all the book was really good and this one of the only books that I likedJ.P
4,You can find yourself!!,"Brian was thirteen years old. He rode on a small plane. But the pilot died of heart attack. So he had to fly plane and decided to land it a near by lake. Then he started to survive. His one of lifelines was the hatchet that had given him by his mothor.The hatchet was Brian himself. This book made me excited.Sometimes I felt happy , sometimes I felt sad with Brian. I think this book is a checkered story. I could travel to the bush with Brian. I learned how to survive. Brian did everything possible to live. He was so brave. I could see his development. If you want to find yourself, you should read this book. Probably you can find the new way that you should advance."
1,tere-a-bull book. HORRIBLE! really,This is positively one of the worst books I have ever read. it was less interesting than reading a telephone book. The book was very dull and put me to sleep several times. I cant beleive this book was ever written! sooo bbboorrriinnngg!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,This book was incredibly boring---,"I read this in 2'd grade and hated it. The lack of dialogue and organization in this book made it seem very weak and unrealistic. I believe that if I mixed up the chapters of this book , I could re-arrange them in any order , and it would make just as much sense as it did before. This is because this book was incredibly contrived. The style of writing gets old very fast. With one single weak character you could care less about , and a weak plot , I suggest you dont communicate or make eye contact with an individual who finds this book even remotely exciting."
1,Book was in Extremely Poor Condition,It looked as though a dog chewed on book....book was in very poor condition...Very disappointed in this purchase..Expected much better from Amazon.com
1,this review is not because of the content of the book...its because of the condition it is in,"this book was advertised as being ""very good"". Since when does very good mean that left over food particles are going to be found throughout the book? Also, the cover is quite worn and several of the pages were folded and creased."
3,Good book up to 60 pages,I have read up to 60 pages...... But the book jest Bad.when Brian went on about his MUM and DAD is boring.The story is good the only thing that made the book good was when Brian was on the helecopter and its about land.THe story was great!Gary Paulsen needs take out the parts of Brian thinking about his Mum and Dad!
2,The review of Hatchet,"The book Hatchet is about a 13 year old boy named Brian who went on a plane to see his dad and the plane crashed in Northern Canada. After the plane crashed in the water Brian got on land, he had a lot of bumps and bruises and he keeped passing out. One day after he woke up he remembered that he had his hatchet with him, he used his hatchet to hunt and cut his wood for the fire. A few days later Brian found some berries, and water. He thought someone would find him. He met some animals like a bear, porcupine, and a turtle. Did Brian get saved? Did he survive?I thought the book was ok, but i really dont like the type of story that Hatchet is. I liked how the author had a lot of interesting information. I didnt like how there were to many details. The people that i think would like this book is boys that are 11 or 12 years old."
2,Hatchet-part of my test by Mallory,"I thought Hatchet was an okay book. It was exciting at some parts of the book, but really boring, too. The author repeated things a lot when I already got the point. One thing I liked was that he described the setting very well, and I could get a crystal clear picture of what everything looked like. He also left you wondering about certain things, like Brian's mom's secret, and what really happened to the pilot."
4,Hatchet,"The novel Hatchet is about a thirteen-year-old boy who lived in New York City. His parents are divorced, and Brian is heading to Canada to spend the summer with his father, After Brian's parents divorced, Brian's head becomes filled with wonders. Brain is now going to see his father in the Canadian Wilderness. Brian has to fly from New York City to Canada in a small Cessna 406 Bush plane, with only the pilot and himself. With the pilot having a massive heart attack, Brian has to learn to fly and somehow land the plane in the wilderness. With only the clothes on this on his back and the hatchet his mother gave him, he has to leave the past behind and try to stay alive. The lesson this book thought was to never give up and to be persistence in the face of fear."
4,Brian's Adventures,"The book Hatchet by Gary Paulsen is a great fiction adventure story! The main character, Brian, deals with a lot of difficult obstacles for a thirteen year old. The story is very interesting and little scary, but it is still very enjoyable. To find out how Brian's adventures turn out, read this book!"
3,my review of hatchet,He book Hatchet by Gary Paulsen is a very interesting and adventurous story. It is about a thirteen-year-old boy named Brian Robeson. He was in a plane crash Brian soon found himself on a survival mission in the Canadian wilderness. He had just gone though a divorce of his parents and was very unhappy and upset. His dad moved to Canada for a new job. About half way through the trip the pilot died from a heart attack and died which left Brian alone to fly and land the plane.His first major achievement was making fire and it was his most important. Brian also figures out how to catch food and cook it....
4,Hatchet,"In the book Hatchet, Brian, the main character gets on a plane after he finds out the big secret about his mom during the school year and the beginning of the summer to go and vistit his dad. On the way to Canada where his dad lives his pilot teaches him how to fly. He ends up having to know how to do this cause something happens to the pilot and he has to fly the plain. He then lands in the middle of no where and has to live on his own. He learns how to find food and live. This is a good book until the end because it is very descriptive. I dont like the end because it is way to short and it didnt explain enough."
5,Hatchet - Great for 6th Graders!,"(From my daughter) - I'm 11 and in 6th grade and we read this book for class. I loved the book, but it was a bit gruesome in parts. It's a great story about overcoming obstacles and surviving despite the odds. My favorite part of the book was learning to build a fire without any matches! This book teaches you a lot about what it would be like to survive a plane crash and be left all alone to fend for yourself out in the elements. All you're left with are your own thoughts and you have to process things that happened in your life because you don't have anyone else to talk to. You have to learn to be resourceful and figure out how to survive, even when you don't want to."
3,Hatchet was OK,"Hatchet was a good book. In the beginning it was very boring, but it picked up. I think Gary Paulsen shouldn't spend so much time writing about the scenary. I would recommend this book for school reading."
4,Hatchet,"12 year old boy, Hatchet was overal a great book. This book was about a 13 year old boy surviving in the wilderness. As his pilot has a heart attack he tries to get help on his cb radio. When he gets on the ground he lives there for months. overal a really great book."
2,Annoying Book,"This book has a pretty good story, but there were too many flashbacks and repitions in this book. The author is talking about a boy named Brian Robeson who is stranded on the lost woods of northern Canada by a plane crash. His has no time to think about his parent's divorce, but to survive in the wilderness. While surviving, he remembers he has his hatchet from his birthday to save help him stay alive..."
4,Lost in the land of green,"Ever been lost in the mall or in a store and u were scared and didnt know what to do? Well imagine if u were lost in a forest where u have no survival skills execpt for urre brain and a hatchet. Hatchet is for middle school chldren who love adventure books. Its about a boy who took a private plane to go and see his father but on the plane his pilot gets a heart attack. Luckily the boy had a chance to crash land the plane on a nearby lake. The plane went under water including all of his supplies and food. His only tool and weapon is his hatchet. He has to survive, create shelter, and eat wil food. He will have to learn to hunt fish and build somethng safe. The question is will he make it and if he can will he stay there for the rest of his life?"
4,Chris' Review,The Author of this book is Gary Paulsen. This book is not a sequel. This book is set in the Canadian Wilderness. This book is about a boy named Brian Robeson. Brian is flying to see his father. The pilot has a heartattack and wrecks in the Canadian Wilderness. Brian has been trapped there for 47 days. Read and find out if he is still living.
5,Hatchet,The Author of this book is Gary Paulsen.This story took place in the Canadian Wilderness.Brian's plane wrecked.Brian had to learn to survive.Find out if he gets rescued.I would recommend this book.
2,"Cornwall, NY 6th Grader","I am a 6th grader. I rate the book Hatchet 2 stars. It was OK, but not very good. It was BORING!!! It repeats sentences a lot. It also isn't very exciting. There is not enough action. I do NOT recommend it. This book STUNK!!! Aka - DON'T READ IT!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Cornwall, New York, 6th grader","I am a sixth grader. I thought the book Hatchet was just OK. I didn't really like it. I didn't really like it because it was a long book and it went on and on. Also I don't really like survival stories. Another reason I don't like the book is because it's just like Brian does this, then he does this, then this happens and it goes on and on with boring events that do not want me to keep reading. I would rate this book a two on a scale from one to five. This is why I do not like the book Hatchet."
3,Hatchet book report,The book I did my report on was Hatchet. It was written by Gary Paulsen. It is a realistic- fiction. I thought it was ok because I thought it had some unrealistic suff in it. He gets stranded on a island and he fights to survive. I would recomend it for people that are extremely bored.
2,Hatchet-06,"Hatchet is the story of Brian Robeson. A young boy with a frustrating home life. But as Brian boards a small airplane taking him to see his father in Canada he realizes he is the only passenger. Quickly frustration becomes fear. However the flight seems to be going fine and the fear seems to wane. That is until the pilot dies of a heart attack and sends the tiny plane plummeting into the ground. Miraculously Brian survives the plane which landed in a small lake. But can he survive the hunger, the animals, the elements, and the loneliness he will find in the Canadian forest when he has nothing but a small hatchet to help him?This is a great story if you like adventure and nature tales. Though it starts out a little slow it picks up quickly and draws you in to it. The under story about Brian's parents and home life gets a little confusing at times but mostly it helps enrich the story. I recommend this book for ages 10 and up."
4,you need to read Hatchet!,"Have you ever woundered what it would be like if you were stranded on an island by youself? Unfortunately that was reality for Brian, in the book; Hatchet by Gary Paulsen. It all starts when a single engine plane on its way to Brians dads house crashes in the widerness of Alaska, on an island. The piolt doesn't survive and brian is all by himself. Brian lives with great hunger and many other terrible conditions by himself. This novel kept me on my toes and looking forward to what was ahead! There are plenty suprises and interesting things that happen to Brian. I think Hatchet is directed towards ages ten and up. Read this book you will not be dissapointed."
5,Hatchet,"I read and you have to read Hatchet by Gary Paulsen. I would rate it five out of five stars. It was a survival fiction book. After I read Hatchet, I stuck to that genre. I admired Paulsen's description since he made each and every detail matter later on in the book. If you are looking for a book that will take you into the forest, lost, alone, scared, and yet surviving as if you weren't from the city and knew nearly nothing about survival, or you're just looking for a book you won't want to put down, Hatchet by Gary Paulsen is the book for you."
5,EPIC ADVENTURE!!!,buy this book now it is totally awesome it's the best adventure book ever same with the next book brians winter so buy this book right away
5,NOT MUCH OF A READER BUT LOVED THIS BOOK,"It is full of adventure, endurance, strength, and basically being put to the test. Great bookfor anyone within its age group and above."
3,Its okay...,This book kinda grows on you. I had to read it for school this summer. I hated it at first. I went through it and I liked it. What are the odds of that?
3,Good Book,"I like this book because of its Location. But I do not like how he has his hatchet wiyh him for a while in the begining of thr book, and Brian dosent remember that he has it"
4,Hayley Hatchet Review,"The plot to this book was exciting. Brian is on a plane. He is going to visit his dad. Then the pilot had a heart attack! Brian was in panic, and he did not know what to do! He manages to crash safe but hurt. Mr. Robertson had heard wildlife and fell asleep for the entire night. Brian decided to go and take a drink from the lake but threw up. Brian managed to make a fabulous shelter. Brian found his own sweet berries, and he made a wonderful fire. It was lucky, but Brian found food. Brian almost got saved, but he did not. Brian felt very happy about everything. Brian got attacked by a crazy moose. He luckily was safe. Brian found out that there was a survival pack he was so happy, and he went in the morning to get the survival pack. He had trouble, but he got the great survival pack, and started to make a feast Will there be any life saving thing in the pack? To find out what happens read this amazing book! You really should read this fabulous book. I really love this book!"
4,Hatchet Fever,"This exiting and adventurous novel by Gary Paulsen is a must read for kids 10+. It tells us an amazing story of how a boy survives in the wilderness of Canada for over two months! I love this book because there is a curveball around every corner. One moment Brian(the boy) could be out looking for food and the next being rammed by a moose. The question for all you wondering is, will he survive?"
5,I need shelter,"January 9,2002 I recomend this book because Gary Paulsen makes very exciting surival tales. Anyone who likes the outdoors or woods should like this book and other survival tales by Gary Paulsen. This book is great for kids second grade and up. It's even good for adults. I think Gary Paulsen is an awesome writer. After the plane that Brian was riding crashed into the ""L"" shaped lake, I had to read more. This book is one of the best books I've ever read!"
4,Go Falcons!,"A teenager named Brian Robeson is in a bush plane on his way to visit his father in Canada. Unfortanently the pilot has a heart attack, and Brian is forced to take down the plane. After a rough landing Brian must make a shelter and find food. But all he has is money, and a hatchet. Now Brian has to figure out how to get out of the wilderness, and safely home. But somethings in nature might not cooperate with him."
4,"Charlotte's Web, a moving story",I think that this was an overall moving story. This would be a great book for a teacher to read to her class for grades K through 4. The author does a good job in giving human characteristics to the animals in this story. This characterization of animals makes it easier for children to associate with them. This story is good to teach young children about the natural event of death. This book is also good for children to read for entertainment purposes. This is a one of a kind story that a child will never forget.
3,"Hatchet, a great survival story","I think that this was an overall exciting book. This would be a good book for a child age 8 to 12 to read by themselves. This book seems to be intended to be read for entertainment purposes. This book would also be good for a teacher to read to her class for grades K through 4. The author does a good job in describing the setting. Through his use of detailed description, you feel like you are in the woods with the young boy."
4,Paulsen delivers-,Paulsen delivers fantasy in his story of a boy caught in the wilderness after his plane crashed in the Canadian wilderness on his way to his dads house. He encounters many obstacles and struggles to make it from day to day. The wonderful thing about Hatchet was my abilty to put myself in Brians shoes and wonder what exactly I would do in that position (would I be able to burn good ole Andrew Jackson to start a fire or not - probably not).
5,An Awesome Book,"Gary Paulson's ""The Hatchet"" was one of the best books I have ever read. The excitement and danger on every turn of a page made it hard to put down. The main character, Brian, uses his brain to a maximum extentwhen he has hardly anything. Then he makes things out of wood using the one thing he has, a hatchet. He finds out he can make a fire with the hatchet and get supplies from the crashed plane and almost forgets about his home. he makes arrows and a bow and he hunts and fishes for food. This book is one of the most magnificent books I have ever read. I love it so much, I have read it four times. It is a great book for fifth grade through seventh grade. I would recommend it to everyone."
2,very boring and to long,This book was boring and dumb. I would never recommend this book to anyone. Brian is in a place were there is lots of food and he is starving because he is ignorant.
2,Very long and boring,"I think that this book was way to long and boring. I would'ntrecommend this book to anyone, because it drags on and takes to longto get on with the story. That is my review for the Hatchet."
3,good book but ...,"My son loved the book (me too!) but he had a hard time reading it because of the bad punctuation, or should I say, barely no punctuation at all. The publishing company should be more carefull."
2,Hated It,"Okay, at first it was good. I liked it. But when the plane crashed, it just got boring. Description in books is good, but there was just SO much of it. I couldn't stand it. It just went on and on and on about how hungry he was and his stupid hatchet. I just stopped reading it because I hated it so much. Even to get to the plane crash, I had to force myself to read it. Maybe it's just me, but that's the worst book I've ever read."
4,"Starts bad, but picks up.","This is very real ,and astonishingly true. There are a few soap opera kind of stuff (like Brian's mother going out with another man), but Gary Paulsen's books were always good, clean, family entertainment. The fight with the moose (or deer, I can't remember)is the best part. I give it 4 stars, for it's truth about survival, but the bad part was the soap opera shtick. Rating:young. has violence, and sexual conduct."
4,Hatchet,This book had me wondering what will the main character do. Gary Paulson is a great author. He has written many books such as The Car and Brians Winter.The main character Brian Robeson is flying to Canada to see his Dad. He faces many challenges. After the airplane pilot dies of a heart attack he goes on a long journey to find his Dad.Before the heart attack the his mom gave Brian a hatchet. I would probably give this book four stars.
3,Hatchet,I gave this book three stars because I think the author could have done a better job in making the book. The whole book was spent almost in one spot. Other than that alot of things happened in the fifty some days he was stranded in the forest. I think it was ironic because right when he found the survival equipment he was saved. Other than that it had a pretty good plot. thats why I gave this book 3 out of 5 stars.
5,Hatchet is a good read!,"Hatchet was interesting. I was amazed how Brian survived with just a Hatchet. I can't believe he could dive so well. You would want to read this book because its is about a kid who is in a plane crash and survives in the forest for 54 days. It is suspenseful, and I had a hard time putting it down. Not good for kids under 8, because there is one gruesome part."
2,A boy learns how to survive in the wilderness.,This was the dumbest book I ever read. It was so boring. This story has been written a million times before. It was the same old thing.
4,A great adventure novel for boys,This was a great moving novel about a boy who crashes in the low down Canadian Moutains and has to try to survive by him self in the wilderness with only his hatchet. This was a great novel.The book contains some of natures animals and weather.The boy survives for about one year before being rescued.
4,my english R.A.P. reveiw-sage,"I thought this was a really good book after i read it a read it again for fun when i was bored, i have read some of Gary Paulsons other books but this one was my favorite and i cant wait to read more of your books. It had really good descriptions which helped paint pictures in my head so i knew what was going on for once.This is one of the first like real book that has chapters and not anime that actually made sense to me for once, it has some similarities that I have in my life again can't wait for something good like this book Hatchet."
4,amanda's book review,"I read the book Addie Across the Prarie. This story is about a little girl named Addie who moves from Sabule,her home,to Dakota. In the story,Addie and her two brothers,Burt and Lew,come in contact with some indians. Also,Addie and Burt escape from a prarie fire while her parents were building their new house. This was a good story.Amanda McCoy"
5,School Project,In Hatchet there is a boy named Brian Robeson who is 13 years old riding in a airplane. The plane crashes and Brian has to survive in the wilderness. He runs into a little bit of trouble. ALL he has to survive with is a hatchet. It's a good survival book.
3,Survival Adventure,"HatchetBy Gary PaulsenReview by Ms Perkins' ClassHatchet is about surviving in the wild. One summer, Brian is in a plane flying over the Canadian wilderness when the pilot has a heart attack and dies. Brian tries to land the plane and it goes in an L-shaped lake. Brian breaks the window of the plane and swims to shore. Brian is left alone with nothing but a tattered windbreaker and a hatchet that his mom had given him. It is hard for Brian to try to survive, but eventually he manages to build a shelter and to make a spear, a bow, and a ladder. It's not easy to survive, but if you have faith in yourself, you can find a way to do it. Gary Paulsen tells the story without a lot of description. If you like books with adventure, you will like this story."
2,A DISGUSTING BOOK THAT IS UNREALISTIC,I ABSOLUTLY HATE THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!! It has a horrible plot and is really disgusting! If you really like gorey books then maybe you will like but it is so sick and i hope you agree with me. THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT 2 STARS IS BECAUSE GARY PAULSEN PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO IT--OTHER WISE I THINK IT STINKS!
3,Hatchet,I enjoyed this book a little. I would recommend this book to a lot of people. I really liked the beginning of the book and the last part of the book but I was not so fond of the middle of the book. I found the middle part of the book kind of boring. I liked the thought of all of the dangerous animals in the book. Overall I really liked the book.
3,Hatchet,"I thought this was an interesting book but seemed to me to be written for younger kids, maybe in fifth grade. I read it very quickly (in half an hour). I didn't feel like I connected with Brian though. I felt that the characters weren't what made the story interesting."
4,Survival,An interesting story of a youngster in the wilderness enduring the trials and tribulations of learning how to survive on his own.
5,Perfect!,"Everything was exact! Thank you. My apologies for the late feedback! I'm pretty new at this, but now I understand how important feedback is for your business. Keep doing what you do and thanks again!"
3,For Sisters fanatics....,"For all those Sisters completists (guilty!), this is a short, down to earth offering from the woman who made Floodland sound so damn good. Musically it's nothing like Floodland, though. Minimalistic production and basic rock tunes put it closer to First and Last..., but with more of a dancy beat to it. Not a bad album - it makes you wonder what the next effort would have been like. Unfortunately, this is the only thing she ever recorded post-Sisters. (Oh, well, at least she isn't milking it like Andrew has been for the last decade...)"
4,Clever,"As romance books go, this 1 is both literate & charming. Mixing -Beauty & the Beast-, -Rebecca-, &-Kim- [at the very least], Lennox creates many charming people in this tale of a man mauled by a tiger & the pretty maid who rescues him when he returns from India. From their first meeting, Lord Aubrey is captivated by Miss Lilas Merrit, a non-traditional Englishwoman w/non-traditional beauty. Forced to marry & breed an heir, he quickly discovers the charm of her musicial, Gypsy-loving free spirit.Nothing outstanding, but i *did* enjoy identifying the sources!"
3,"Beautiful book, but poorly written and edited.","This book is a visual masterpiece, and the recipes are largely phenomenal. However, it is poorly written and edited. The recipes assume you have nothing less a professional background and easy access to the most obscure ingredients and equipment.(acetate strips? Glucose syrup? I found the former at a kitchen supply store, not easy to come by. The latter--I needed a few teaspoons, and the only store I found that carried it sold it only in 4.4 pound tubs!)The recipes are poorly edited. Instructions often make simply no sense whatsoever. Ingredients are sometimes listed in the instructions but not in the ingredient list. Someone needs to take a serious look at this book and edit it cover to cover."
3,There is not enough recipes on chocolate making.,No enough recipes on how to make various chocolates. It mainly focus on how to make cakes/tortes. There is not enough variety.
1,Worst choIcolate pecan pie on the planet,"I just finished tearing out the pages of this worthless book and sending them to recycling, while throwing the binder into the trash compactor with the dreadful chocolate pecan pie it spawned. Never have I seen such a degradation of Valrohna chocolate, Normandy butter, free range eggs and a great deal of time. What a dreadful, dry, disgustging mess this recipie is! Do not waste your time on it."
5,DELIGHTFULLY DECADENT,"If you love chocolate yourself, or if you simply know someone who loves chocolate, as I do, this is THE definitive work! It begins with a fascinating look at the history of chocolate and then goes on to give us every chocolate recipe imaginable--and some that are not! There are recipes for candies, cakes, cookies, fillings and cocoas, all generously laced with gorgeous photographs that only add to the enjoyment of the book. Of particular interest to me and my family was the recipe for Mexican chocolate sauce, a wonderful combination of chilies and chocolate. The book also has recipes and tips for decorating with chocolate. I've tried many of the recipes and all have turned out simply delicious. And, if you're looking for a dessert to impress guests, you're sure to find it here! For the chocolate lovers of the world, this book certainly has it all."
5,The chocolate Bible,"I wasnt sure if I was going to like the CHOCOLATE BIBLE when I had ordered it. I dont always have the best luck in ordering books. I was very, very happy about this book. I loved it!. I also couldnt put it down. It has a complete history of chocolate and lots of incredible recipes. I refer to it daily. The CHOCOLATE BIBLE has many pictures and complete instructions. Everything is so precise and so easy to follow. It has helped me learn techniques in baking as well as the design of the finished product....turning it into a masterpiece. Im sure it can help you too."
2,Missing top,This item came to me on time and packaged well. The issue I have was the plastic top was missing.
1,Fake perfume,"I had Obsesion about ten years ago,and I loved it very much,though I'm a for life fan of Dolce Vita,which is my usual perfume.This time I wanted a change so I ordered Obsesion from Smellies Direct.First,this perfume contain too much alcohol,and at first spray is very powerful,but,unfortunately it doesnt last more than about 15 minutes,and I also detect a kinda bad smell at dry down,like a burnt rubber..Fortunately they dont sell on Amazon anymore."
3,O Snap Kit School House,"This school is very nice looking and adds a nice touch to my grandson's O guage train set. However, it really needs to be glued together to not fall apart."
5,"If you like Louisiana architecture, you'll love this book!",Hays Town developed his own interpretation of Louisiana-flavored design that is timeless. The pictures are inspiring; both inside and out. His total control over the houses resulted in interesting and functional design both inside and out. I would recommend for anyone thinking about building or buying.
2,disappointing,"Considering the price the book was a dissapointment to me. As an anchitect who lives in Baton Rouge, I would have liked to have known the address of the houses covered so that I could view them in person. An interior designer may like it better because it covers the interiors much more than the exteriors. The book covers houses with mixed design style. People here have praised his work to me so oftern that I was anxious to view his work. I am not impressed."
5,Growing Up Italian,"I bought this book in hardcover when it first came out. I simply love it. The essays by famous Italian-Americans are concise, yet filled with lovely anecdotes and things all Italian-Americans can relate to. Two of my adult children have recently discovered it and also loved learning a little about their heritage and more about how their mother grew up."
4,It's nice.,My son is 8 months and doesn't really show that much interest in it right now. Though I am sure that will change as he is ever changing.
4,Very Talented Author!,This is the first book I read by Kwan...It was exactly what I thought it would be....This author is very powerful with the pen...I rated this book 4 starts...because I'm a sequel freak...I hate when characters die in the end....if it was not for that...it would of been 5 stars...can't wait to read the rest of his books!....
4,Goodness is all I can say!,"This book was off the hook. It sure enough was a page turner. K'wan had did it again. I didn't care to much for Gangster, but Road Dawg was good and now this one is off the hook. K'wan you kept a sister up reading this book! I must give you 2 thumbs up!"
5,OFF da HOOK!,K'wan has done it again! He did it up in Gangsta and he did it once more! This book was off the HOOOOOOOOOK like whoa! I aint gonna lie and say a book it good when it's not! Trust and believe you gotta get this book......
1,Couldn't get through it!,I ended up giving this book away. I could not get into the girl being molested continuosly by her dad once her momma died & then the boyfriend offing him. It was too much to stomach. Too many graphic details of sexual abuse & incest. After about three quarters through I had to stop. Gave it to a co-worker who was bored & looking for something to read. I've never read another book from this author since. Too scared.
3,My thoughts on Street Dreams,"To me Gangsta was much more intense. Street Dreams was slower, but written better. So which one is my favorite? Both! K'wan is a great writer with cool storylines. My only problem with Street Dreams is that it had a lot of characters that didn't really make or break the story. So why were they mentioned? I hated the way Joyce's character was portrayed. The scene when she gave him the bl*^ job was straight wack! You could tell the book was written from a male's point of view. I would still have to say this book was still good. Road Dawgs is next on my list to critique."
