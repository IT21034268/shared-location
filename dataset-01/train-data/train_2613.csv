3,Solid instruction but not for beginners,"Mann et al provides solid swing advice for more advanced golfers. I found the chapter on the ""transition"" particularly useful. However, some of the excercises are difficult to emulate, even for the more athletically inclined. Moreover, the various ""positions"" emphasized tend to result in a ""mechanical"" feel to the swing throughout the text. Personally, I think Jimmy Ballard's ""How to Perfect Your Golf Swing"" presents easier swing concepts, especially for the less advanced player."
5,No Mysteries,"I've recently taken up the game of golf and was interested in finding a definitive swing system to master while I was still new at the game; I didn't want to unlearn something that was detrimental to my game after I had ingrained it. ""Swing like a Pro"" IS that system. Based on biomechanics and intensive scientific research, this book completely demystifies the golf swing and gives you some of the best instruction and drills imaginable for developing a consistent, CORRECT swing that is fundamentally sound in all aspects. If you are looking to get past hype and want to learn the TRUE mechanics of THE great golf swing, this book is for you.To all the fans of ""Search for the Perfect Swing,"" this is the tome that takes the concepts in that book to the next level."
5,An Outstanding Book.,"Swing like a Pro is an excellent read and a technical swing reference! I'm glad someone used biomechnics to finally unlock the perfect swing. Unfortunately, to swing like a pro, I agree with the authors that you may have to spend six or more hours a week working on the chapter's drills with your clubs, a practice golf shaft and metronome. For professionals like myself, I don't have that kind of time to build a game. In addition to the practice shaft and metronome, I recommend a net and practice mat to work on the drills. You'll go broke if you try the drills at a golf range."
5,Great book,"As a former PGA Professional who's been a student of the golf swing for over 25 years, my advice for anyone who truly wants to improve their long game (Pelz is the short game guru of choice): BUY THIS BOOK!! No guesswork, great drills, well illustrated.As for the few somewhat less than glowing reviews, I found the sheer ignorance (""swing the hands"", ""WSU is a party school"", ""I'm so confused"") of the boneheads who wrote them quite hilarious. Classic."
4,Good instructional book but need more photo description,"Quite good in describing the whole transition of a golf swing. But I think the book need more photo of different view of swing, e.g. top, side, back etc with description. As the publisher also a screen saver software which display different view of a swing. This book should put more pictures captured from such software."
4,"Hey, I am talking to you!........ Yeah YOU.",All I can say is pick this $hit up.It has some of the best Mcs out there. You can't front on the Living Legends or the Hiero crew.
1,Does not work with DCR-SR40,Doesnt work even though the LENMAR website says it does. I thought it was a pretty good deal for $26. I wouldnt even give it one star coz it plain doesnt work.
1,Don't Get This!!! - Not equivalent to Sony NP-FP70,I ordered this battery as an equivalent to Sony NP-FP70. The battery contact area is not the same as SONY and I cannot use it with my camcorder DCR-SR200. The description for this battery in Amazon is misleading and incorrect. IT IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO NP-FP70. Do not waste you time and money.
1,Don't get it,"They say 100% compatible but is not, because is not an info Ion-Litio, so is not a Eqivalent battery, dosn't work. Don't expend your money on this stupid battery"
3,Great model but,"Aloha Just finished the model. It floats great BUT will not stay up right. It wants it tip over on it's side. I took the Texas cabint off and it stayed upright but if a little breeze or on a turn it will tip over on it's side. With the main cabin off it runs great. Big deal,if I wanted a model to put on the shelf I would not have powered it up. Batteries,motor, servio's, rc controls etc. I e-mailed Dumas but no answer yet. Fun to build and looks great but to sail it not good. On one of the RC clubs all the video's I looked at,none of them showed a stern wheeler paddling around that was complete. Just the hull, motor, electric or steam and the paddle wheel."
2,"Great for Artists, not so great for jewelers","The good: This book has absolutely drop dead gorgeous illustrations of fine jewelry created using precious metals and precious stones.The bad: The book is targeted primarily to those who have excellent drafting or drawing skills, with very little to no instruction provided in developing the skills needed to execute the concepts in the book.The ""artistic values"" are presented as matter of fact axioms, with no support or explanation. In other words, this is not a ""how to do it"" book at all. It's a lovely presentation of jewelry design illustration, but there is no teaching here, and no hints on how the illustrations might be actually rendered in metal and stone.Nice ""idea book"" for manufacturing fine jewelers who render metal from drawings, but of little to no value for small scale artist jewelers with no drawing skills who render pieces via improvisitory skills and spontaneous arrangement of physical objects."
2,Don't spend the money,It's a beautiful book but if you really want to learn to draw jewelry do not get this book unless you are an artist and can draw pretty much whatever you see.
3,More Than You Want to Know,"This video would be a great keepsake for someone who works for the Cable Car division, but it's just not very interesting to the average person. I gave my copy to the local library.It was fun, when we went to San Francisco, to see some of the guys in the movie working the cable cars. Not enough fun to justify the cost of the video, but fun, none the less."
4,best brush i've found !,"Great brush...I've had frizz problems in the past...tried different serums constantly..then tried this brush and it worked....Straight hair, nice shine..the only downfall was that the handle broke fairly quickly (3 months) I've glued it back..so far so good. just ordered another one just in case."
2,cheap,brush parts un-glued the second time I used it... It's not worth the price at all. I have cheaper brushes that have lasted longer. The handle gets sticky with the heat of the blow dryer and your hands get sticky and your hair gets pulled by the handle because of it..
1,Did not perform up to snuff,"I used my 36"" bag once and it was scuffed up like it was in use for 10 years. The fabric was also pierced. My wife had a smaller version and that was pierced also. The 36"" is just too big for air travel and it is hard to handle. It may be perfect for road trips but cannot survive airport handlers. It may also be good for baskeball or other sport teams to carry their equipment in but again, not for air travel."
1,Trouble in Dubai,"I purchased two of the Sierra 36-inch wheeled duffles for a recent trip to Afghanistan. Unfortunately, upon arrival in Dubai, I found that each of the bags were damaged. In one bag, I lost all the contents of the zippered end compartment. The bags did not hold up to the rigors of international travel. Obviously, I cannot recommend the duffle."
2,Used only once,"I bought this item because of all the good reviews, especially stating it's good quality. One of the end pockets split the first time I used it, and it wasn't even full or that heavy. It rolls easy and packs a lot of stuff, but my 40 minute flight was more than it could take."
2,Mike and Molly,"I love Melissa McCarthy and Billy Gardell so, I thought, I would naturally love Mike and Molly andI do love THEIR characters...but the Molly's sister and mother are crude and disgusting. I do NOT like them. I would never order another season of this show. I had not watched it prior to purchasing it and that was MY mistake....The vendor I purchase it from was great!!! The story could be really good but by making the sister morally bankrupt and the mother a lush, they are not characters I want to get to know...."
2,Not as good as reviews suggest,"We were impressed by all the 5-star ratings and hoped that this would be a great instrument for our 4th grader to start on. I had about 10 years of flute study (though have not played for awhile), and found it a struggle to get quality sound from the instrument--I would think it would be extremely frustrating for a total beginner."
5,Excellent!,A great deal I've got from this site. Excellent quality for such a great price. I highly recommend this instrument for beginners and pro alike.
4,Good instrument,"I paid extra for 1-3 day delivery, but I received it in 4-5 business days. I was a little bit disappointed. However, the instrument is very good."
4,"great flute, for affordable price","Sounds clear, loud, lots of tones. a great flute for a affordable price, i would recomend you get this. so far, no problems, all nessesary keys are here, just a quick tip, next time you should provide with a cleaning sheet for the flute."
5,Love it!,"My sister bought this flute, and it was her first flute. She loved it, and so did everybody else in her class. Great flute, and sounds beautiful(:"
4,Good product.,Very good product. Worth the money. Sound quality is also superb. Well-made and looks durable.
3,leak in the G note,I brought this flute for my son for his birthday and I had to return it twice once for a leak in the G note and now for the flute falling apart. The only reason I brought this flute was for the 2 year warranty. Thank God for that.
1,Dreadful Survey,"I have to use this book for a doctoral survey class. I have a comprehensive background in music history as well as a general history minor. This book is more about ideas than about learning music history. If you want to teach people how to research you might use this book. It is not a review of music history but of concepts and ideas. If you want to know about composers this isn't the book for you. I agree totally with the other review, it's dense and presumes you know a great deal about philosophical movements, extra historical background and can speak Latin, Italian, French and German in addition to English."
3,little disappointed,"Was really excited to find a DVD on learning to surf. Had read a beginners book about 3 times, but am a more visual person. Needed something to give me a little more confidence to get into the water with the big boys (and girls). Found the instruction good, simple & very basic. When it ended, I thought part 2 would start. Little disappointed that it was so short. Could have used more tips on etiquette in the water."
2,Not up to par for Feinstein.... nothing new to say.,"If you are a golf fan you know how it ends. The book is not as entertaining or as enlightening as A Good Walk Spoiled. Unfortunately he spends too much space on the US Open and Masters and seems to rush through The Open. Overly focussed on US golfers with next to nothing on the capable players from the European tour. Gushy fan stuff for the most part, though I did enjoy reading about the asshole grouping at the US Open."
4,The best book about the majors i have ever read!,"Mr.Feinstein has exceeded all expectations. A Good Walk Spoiled was an excellent behind the scenes on the PGA tour. The Majors utilized the same approach that only Feinstein seems to be able capture. Watching the majors this year, seemed much more interesting to watch having read this book. I have always considered myself a fan of golf but after reading this wonderful book i feel closer to the game and the tradition that it represents. Thank you for this great book, Mr. Feinstein!"
3,No Good Walk Spoiled,"While the book is good in the sense it describes some men and their attempt to win a major, it falls a little short of the quality of Feinstein's last work A Good Walk Spoiled. Too much hole by hole drama and not enough human interest. After all, we all know what happened in the tournaments."
4,worth reading,"this is very much like his first book. it gives one an insight of what it is like inside the ropes at the majors. i thought i understood how much a major meant, but i was wrong. feinstein is able to give one an insight of what it is like for golf, and inherently i what it must be like in other sports, e.g, the superbowl, world series, etc.it is interesting that the majors are ranked in order of importance - masters, us open, british open, and the pga - this is also how he wrote the book, that is about half of the book is about the masters with a small sliver devoted to the poor-forgotten pga."
2,Boring. Tired.,"There is, if you can actually believe it, a line in this book about Fred Couples' girlfriend going to the bathroom. In an effort to just write whatever down, Feinstein has included a bunch of pointless subplots and ignored, once again, the tournaments themselves. The PGA, in this book, is just some homecoming for Fred Couples. You don't even get a reasonable picture of the course.You would think, given the book is about four damn events, Feinstein could tell you about the course. But, then, he figures every person who reads his book knows exactly what the hell he's talking about at all times, so....we get anecdotes about Fred Couples wanting to leave, if only his girlfriend weren't in the bathroom."
3,New to teaching writing on the secondary level--some hints how to,"Pick up one of the cheapest used copies. There's a great overview for lower level writers about the five paragraph essay. If your students are like mine, you'll use M. S. Willis's lesson every term. Some of the better students will get the idea of a thesis and topic sentences just from the one lesson. Others will neet a blazing pencil inserted under the fingernails. Ah, give it a shot."
4,"Very funny, very fresh","A fresh, funny take on romance. Likeable, sexy characters, fast pace, lots of entertaining and well-made subplots make this a winner. Look forward to more from this author."
2,Not Quite A Gamecock Classic ...,"Deborah Ford's GRITS primer is a sweet little read that can't quite make its mind up as to whether it wants to be a primer or a memoir when it grows up, but is certainly on a literary path that could have been finessed with much better style given an hour or two with a Southern editor. This particular romp isn't nearly as breathtakingly funny as the 'Sweet Potato Queens' series nor anywhere as acerbic as anything from Florence King, Fannie Flagg's hilarious foreword to the contrary."
2,Too Politically Correct,The writer of the GRITS Guide to Life covered too much truth with political correctness. Southern Ladies are not accurately portrayed.
4,Grits,"I was expecting the food grits. This was not. I threw this book in the garbage, after splatting real grits on it. For some reason my very heterosexual guy neighbor loved this book! so if you are like him, buy it!"
4,Hilarious!!!,"DON'T read this book if you're looking for a guide to life. DO read it if you're a female who was raised in the South! Often a parody of what life really was like for a southern girl, but then at times I would read a phrase and hear my mother (raised in Mississippi) telling me something similar...I've read several snippets aloud (in my best southern voice) to some of my non-GRITS friends and now they're dying to read the book!Just DON'T take it too seriously!"
3,Fun to read but a bit sloppily written,"I copied quite a few of the funny parts out of this book to share with friends, so I did get my money's worth, but I found this book to be more of a mish-mash of general info thrown together than a personal, heartfelt guide to what it means to be a Girl Raised in the South. A much better book in the same vein is Southern Belle Primer, which goes into lots of detail about silverware patterns, wedding present displays, and charm school."
4,Great book.,"This copy is a gift. After getting my own copy, which I love, I had to share this with another ""Girl Raised in the South."" From practical tips, to views of my childhood, this book is rich with examples of life in the South. The format is easy to read, full of humor, and keeps moving. I have purchased other books by this author because I so enjoy her writing."
3,made in Spain,"I ordered this wrench for slightly less than I could get a real Crescent wrench, assumming that with an old name like Klien the wrench would be made in the USA. When I received the wrench, I was very disapppointed to see Spain stamped on the handle. The wrench may do all that I ask of it but knowing what I now know I would not have ordered it."
4,Funny post-fairytale sequel for children or adults,"Nicholas Stuart Gray asks the question, What happened to the poor seventh prince (of the Swan Princes) who had to go through the rest of his life with one arm and one wing? He writes the answer with charm and humor, thrown in with a liberal sprinkling of adventure and heroism. An unwelcome plot twist took one of the stars away from my review, but overall I loved this book when I picked it up at the library. It was very funny and interesting. Check out ""Grimbold's Other World"" for a 5-star N.S. Gray experience."
5,Superb and engrossing,"The fugitive prince is an excellent peice of work.The only other writers I know of that can produce such work are Robin Hobb and Chris Bunch.To often writers create a story in which one side is completely good and the other absolutely evil. In this series we are faced with two major opposing forces,the two princes.And it will be extremely unfair to classify the prince at fault as evil.This is a compelling sequel and Wurts is worthy of the highest accolade."
5,I LOVE IT!!!,This series ROCKS! Read it now if you are a fantasy fan. Better than everything that anyone else can throw at it!
1,Very nearly the worst ever,"While Wurts has never been (and never will be) known as a prose stylist, this book is not just badly written, but spectacularly awful.Her previous successes have evidently given her, her agent, and/or her publisher the delusion that she no longer needs an editor. This is not the case; although it's clear that she stands more in need of a coauthor than an editor.As William Atheling (James Blish) would have said, had he been unfortunate enough to live to see it, an entire course on how not to write could be built on this novel's hapless corpse.Suffice it to say that if you have any love of language, you will find this book unendurable.Of course, since you're on the Web reading this, you're probably a Wurts fan and will therefore swallow all of her infelicities uncritically, if not enthusiastically.The acknowledgements make arch mention of the hundreds of trees sacrificed to make this book; Wurts owes each and every one of them an abject apology."
5,The Plot Thickens...,"I just want to say that with each book she writes, Janny Wurts just gets better and better. In 'Fugitive Prince' the plot thickens. Although the book itself has a few major events in it, it feels more like it's concerned with filling in the blanks, passing time, and making a few revelations. The language is grand, as are the characters. And whoever thinks that they feel sympathy for Arithon after Warhost of Vastmark - trust me, Janny Wurts wrings tears with this one."
4,Well done on an epic scale,"Luckily I've been previously introduced to Ms. Wurts's books. ""Fugitive Prince"" is an excellent beginning for the next, well developed, story arc in the Mistwraith series. The book reads slow only if you dislike the depth of character Janny establishes. If you keep in mind the fact that the characters make these books what they are, the reading is quite entertaining. What the book may lack in action it makes up for in plot development and epic promise. Janny does a fine job handling capable adult heroes. The theme of accountability plays heavy against the theme of justice here. I'm very pleased to hear that Ms. Wurts plans to lengthen the scale of this series. This lets her do a little more of the development we see in ""Fugitive Prince"". If you liked the other books in the series definitely get a hold of this one. It has just the right mix of, ""what'll happen next,"" and, ""jeeze that was rough""."
5,Respectful of both parents and children,"Dr. Jay Gordon encourages parents to follow their instincts and tune in to their baby in this guide to parenting that covers the period from pregnancy through baby's first year. This book advocates a gentle approach to parenting infants and strongly supports breastfeeding -- it's clear that Dr. Gordon, unlike many authors, knows the research on infant feeding and is responsible enough to share it (unlike those doctors like my first pediatrician who give you ""babies do just fine on formula"" instead of providing information based on research). An Appendix titled ""A-Z Conditions and Concerns"" provides information on such topics as jaundice, infant acne, and teething. Dr. Gordon is so funny, down to earth, and wise, and I never feel as though he's pandering or talking down to the reader. I'm glad he wrote this book."
2,Read Dr. Sears' books instead!,"I found out about Dr. Jay from doing internet research about vaccines. I listened to an interview with one of his famous patients (patient's parent, actually): Noah Wyle and his wife. They raved about attachment parenting, and convinced by Dr. Jay's website, I ordered this book as well as his Vaccines DVD.I should have stuck with my instincts about staying with Dr. Sears' books instead.This book is redundant and conflicts itself in many spots. He doesn't get to the point in a lot of areas where I was hoping for concise instructions or opinions. Overall, this book just does not contain the helpful advice that I was accustomed to in the Sears library. Read ""The Baby Book"" or ""Attachment Parenting Book"" by Sears instead."
5,The Best Book Available,"In this book, Dr. Jay presents a philosophy that treats children with respect, love and nurturing. From having read many, many child rearing books, this is the best book I've come across. It's certainly not an in-depth ""how to"" like the Sears books, and I don't believe that was Dr. Jay's intent. I believe its fundamental value is in sharing a new way of thinking. As the title suggests, it presents the thought process behind how to approach parenting. And, while the Sears and other ""how to"" books are great, they're not really needed if you follow the advice in this book -- listening to and respecting your baby and following your instincts. And while this approach certainly asks a little more of us as parents, I see the benefits time and time again in my own children. If only more parents could read this book, I think we'd all have healthier and happier kids. I give a copy to every expecting mom/dad I know. It's a shame it's so hard to find new copies of the book."
1,Listening to your baby,"First of all , this approach is not ""new"" at all. How this man could write a book with so little helpful information is beyond me. The titles of the help sections are tempting, but the sections themselves have absolutely no substance. Pity"
5,A breath of fresh air,"In a year that's seen its share of royal romances and runaway brides, ""The Runaway Princess"" is an impressive standout. Carol Schede's voice is like a breath of fresh air. Funny, sexy, tastefully raunchy, emotionally satisfying -- this story has it all. As does this delightful new author."
2,Superficial all round.,"I was very disappointed in this video. I got the impression the filmmakers took their home video camera to England, and during a free tour, perhaps, happened to video a few very nice English gardens and briefly interview the owners. The gardening information was very superficial, with less than minimal practical information to apply. No doubt, the gardens are beautiful, but you don't learn anything substantial about them. Also, the narration amounts to a lot of hyperbole with a smidgeon of tourbook data to barely keep it afloat. Basically, the narration amounts to filler. Too bad, because the gardens themselves leave you wanting to know so much more.This is a video that gives the impression, whether true or not, that it was made in return for a free trip to England, on a low budget, and without much hard work having gone into it."
3,Entertaining,"I thought the book ""The Lottery"" was a pretty good read. It was entertaining and explored a lot of themes kids these days worry about. The author wrote very well from a kids perspective. I have read other stories where the point of view was from a teenager. The authors don't always get the teenage view of life but I feel Mrs. Goobie captured it well. Some of my favourite scenes were with Dusty, Sal's brother. I thought their relationship was very interesting and he seemed like a pretty cool guy. He was my favourite character in the book. Overall I felt this book was pretty good. If your into teen drama's this is the book for you."
5,Must read!,"Wow! This book is an eye opener. It takes the last half of the century and turns it inside out. If the research weren't so thorough, it would be unbelievable. As someone who lived through most of that period, I was amazed by how much I had forgotten and never knew in the first place. I'm giving it to my teenage daughter, who didn't live through much of it, but really wants to understand the world she lives in. I'm giving it to reading friends for Christmas. I wish I could give it to everyone under 50. We'd all understand our country and ourselves in a whole new light!"
3,Won't add to my collection,"Honestly, I only bought this book because of a class. But it wasn't good enough to convince me to actually keep it, and add it to my growing library of academic books. It provides a excellent source, though, of how the Vietnam War was reflected in Popular Culture which helped when I wrote a 20 page paper on how the events of 9/11 had been portrayed in films since. But otherwise, some of the things Franklin wrote seemed to be boreder on being ""conspiracy theories."" Then again, I really don't know much about the Vietnam war other than what the textbooks (which we all know are oh so accurate. *Sarcasm*) told me."
1,More lies from the Left,"More BS from a true red commie. One fails to mention the 1950 conference in Moscow with Stalin, Mao, and Uncle Ho where they plotted the war. This imbessile's lies are completely refuted by Vietnam: The Necessary War. This book is selective history. Not all factors that lead into and event are represented, only hogwash from a nostalgic hippie. He is the part of the same group of people that distorted the infamous napalm burned girl picture. That girl was hit by napalm from an aircraft piloted by a South Vietnamese pilot in where also a few ARVN soldiers were killed. But for some reason nuts like this guy called it American barbarism. His ilk also left out the caption the South Vietnamese photgrapher wrote on the bottom of the picture.""This never would have happened if the Communists stayed in the North."""
2,"Fine As Beans, But Misleading Advertising Here","The beans are fine... nothing exceptional. One of the reasons I selected this item as a gift was because of the attractive jar in which the beans are presented. As you have guessed by now, the jar is NOT included. In the end, you get a small plastic bag (as also pictured...) with chocolate-covered beans. It is okay, but not worth the price nor the additional shipping costs."
1,Would not buy it again,"1) The beans don't come in the fancy pants jar.2) The beans are super small, most of the ""energy"" would be a sugar rush if any at all.3) They are not bad tasting, but I have had much better.4) Yeah, I am aware that they help or encourage a certain cause, but if you're gonna charge me 5 bucks and change for a small bag of something you better make sure it's the best I've ever had!5) I will give them this, I did not received them all melted, but then again, I did order them during the winter.***Overall, I would not buy them again, too costly, for low quality and deceiving presentation."
2,The product was ok but..,"I expected more for the price. I also expected to receive them in the cute little jar but that did not come at all. I get that the proceeds go to helping empower women. However, for the $6 I paid and the additional $6 in shipping, the product was not worth it. I said I wouldn't return the product because of the organization. However, I do feel misled. I wanted to write this review to say read the fine print on this product."
4,Repaints..always a controversy,"Well, he's the same as the first He-man except for two things: first, the color; second, his axe is replaced by a spinning weapon. I'll focus on the changes...the new color is actually neat. The new weapon isn't that great. It spins. Whoopee. That's it. Maybe if the spin weapon was bigger and maybe more complex, this figure might be better. Basiclly, it's a nice repaint, so if your not a hardcore fan, save your green for a ""newer"" figure. Mildly recommended."
5,The Most Powerful Man in the Universe!!!,"I got this figure in today and I rather like it, I couldn't find a cheap version of the 2000 He-Man reboot character so I got this one instead. He has on Blue boots and loincloth instead of brown (I don't mind it in fact I kinda like it) he has his Sword of Power and Shield but instead of his Axe he has this spinning blade of death. Now Skeletor can be sliced and diced and bashed in to a pulp."
4,Great Gershwin,"While a few of the performances are shallow, most are spot on. Maureen McGovern is incredible - as always. I only wish she had done a repeat of the 'American in Paris' that she did on TV years ago. The mixing was fair, the fact that it was a live audience did not detract. Tracks 10 & 11 are awesome."
4,Firemagic needs redesign,"Have 2 Firemagic grills. These tools do not prevent the cook from feeling the heat when grilling.Would recommend more length... Most Firemagics have the high heat zone deep, toward the back.it would be nice for these tools to accommodate that without the cook feeling the heat."
1,complete and total garbage,"absolutely unlistenable...one of the worst cd's i have ever heard - the male lead's vocals are terrible, the female singers are boring...nothing interesting, or enjoyable to be found here"
2,Not very good,This item was just alright. There were white spots on the black keys and gray and black spots in the white keys. Not as clean as others I have seen (where it is only white and only black in the respectable places). Also as we received it the notch to put through the belt hole would not work and since it was made of a soft metal my boyfriend just bent it and filed it down so it would stay in place and work as a belt buckle (as it was it was way too thick to put in a belt hole and kind of cone shaped sticking out straight...well that will not work as you need something to hook on so that it will stay in place). If I had know all of this prior to ordering it I would not have and I would have looked elsewhere for one.
1,Piece of Junk,"The turntable was at first completely ""off""--brand new recordings sounded wobbly and out of sync. I was able to get this repaired, though it's never been totally right. Then, as others here have pointed out, the motor slowed so much that now records play about a minor 3rd lower than they should. And any older recording which weighs more than the lightest of lightweight LPs often doesn't play at all. A complete rip-off. I will never buy Thorens again."
1,Bad Buy,"My experience is pretty much the same as Croquetman's. Let me add that when I contacted Thorens US representative,he made no effort to stand behind product and instead referred me to a parts supplier. Which did not solve problem. Buying this turntable turned into an expensive mistake for a poor performing piece of equipment that didn't last with only minimal use. Ultimately, I decided to throw turntable out and will never purchase another Thorens product."
1,Terrible Turntable,"This turntable is extremely unreliable and a waste of money. I wanted to get a turntable that played 78s as well as 33s, and thought that this would be a nice choice. I had previously owned a Garard 42M for 30 years, but it only played 33s and occasionally had wow, so I thought this would last for another generation.About a year after I bought it, the player stopped working, and after many attempts to get it going over several days, it began to play at a speed that was so slow that the sound was horribly distorted. Now it does not play at all. It is not the belt, but to repair it now would cost more than it is worth, and who knows how long it would work after the repair? I think I am going to go back to my Garard or try another old turntable."
3,"Catches mice, but kills them slowly","I bought four of these traps, and had great luck with the little grey mice. With the kitchen clean and everything in plastic containers, the mice went for these traps.But one in three times, the mouse was caught but alive when I found it the next morning.This trap doesn't kill instantly, it squeezes the mice so they suffocate. I had misgivings about the slow, painful deaths, so I recommend catch and release or a snap trap that has enough force to kill mice quickly."
3,wrong description,"This description is for the rodent traps, but the part number and picture is for mouse traps...contact the seller directly and they can help you out as they did me."
5,The best traps I have ever used!,I read all the reviews and settled on these traps in hopes of a miracle. I too was sick of pinched fingers in the old style traps. Then I had to listen to my husband tell me that I could set them as well as he could. Well I have to tell you.. when I received them I was skeptical.. but it only took an overnight test and I was hooked! I have already caught 4 mice in under a week of use. I use a bit of peanut butter and they seem to love it. They will clean up great when I am done also. Thank you for such a great product!
5,The #1 mousetrap,We had purchased one of these mousetraps a long time ago and really liked it. We could never find them again in any of the hardware stores but did get a couple of different ones that were basically made the same. They did not work at all!! Finally we were able to find them at Amazon .com and bought 6 when we had a big mouse problem in the spring. We would never use another trap---these are easy to set and catch the mouse every time!!
2,How can this be humane?,"I snapped this thing on my finger, and it didn't even sting! There's no way this could snap a mouse's neck, which means that the mouse is probably going to die of either fear or starvation. I'm sending this one back and looking for something that's more likely to get it over with quickly."
1,Cruel!,Don't buy this trap it's cruel. If you must 'mess' with a chipmunk or any wildlife do it humanely so they are not killed or harmed in any way.
3,Ding Dong the Mice are Dead!,"Well, I'll say this much, we, for whatever reason, had recently taken on a bout of mice under our kitchen sink in our apartment. We bought these traps, put some cheese on them, set them up and lo and behold the next morning the cheese was gone, but the trap was pristine. So we did this again with the same result. Finally I smeared cream cheese on the trap and caught our first mouse, second mouse, and third after some cream cheese/ swiss cheese rigging. A fickle trap but does work in the end. Now I hear that peppermint oil is a major deterrent so I'm going to try that instead. It seems every mouse in the neighborhood is catching on to the feeding frenzy under my sink, so we are going for a one two punch. Hopefully the peppermint will keep them away, but if not, the traps will get them in the end. All in all, I would say, good traps, quick kill."
3,Ok but price could go lower,This product is adequate but when you add in shipping the price is not as good.
3,Where's the mouse?,"The answer is... I havn't caught a mouse in these traps yet! They must be afraid... very afraid! I've caught my fingers in them once or twice... does that count? Perhaps that is why these traps are considered ""humane"", right? LOL"
4,Easy and works!,Caught mice without issue and don't have to 'touch' the nasty little dead bodies. LOL Easy to use and easy to get rid of the dead mouse. Highly recommend!
3,Easy to use.,"These ""better"" mousetraps are really easy to use if they will just set! I have several that will not set with a tiny piece of cheese on the bait platform. One caught a chickadee by the leg which did not make me happy."
4,a better mousetrap,"I like this mousetrap. It is very sensitive, much easier to set and much nicer to release the carcass. We had a sly mouse who was eating the bait repeatedly in a traditional trap and he was caught within a couple hours with this trap."
2,"Well, they look nice","Alas, these traps did nothing for me. Admittedly, our resident mice have become very trap-shy, but even so, they didn't even bother to eat the bait. We've had better luck with the more traditional snap-traps and the box live-trap."
1,Will never buy GoVideo again.,I had the Model 3845 about one year before it started refusing to read DVDs. Several sources said that the laser head burns out if you use it for more than 2-3 hours straight and that's what happened to mine. I understand it is a common problem (look at the number of dead units being sold on eBay). Phone support was discontinued when I tried to call and they never answer e-mails. A $250. boat anchor as even the VCR would not work properly anymore. And failure to respond to a customer is inexcusable.
2,"Great for awhile, then POOF!","Well, I am another victim of Go Video. I have (had?) this model for just over a year. I really liked it, played and recorded well. Used to view DVDs often, and record on occasion. Was in the process of recording a second 2 hour movie on the same day when the unit stopped recording. Tried restarting, would not record or play any DVD. From other reviews, looks like my laser head has burned out. The unit still plays music CDs and the VCR works, so it's just ""mostly dead""."
4,DVD/VHS user,"The DVD/VHS recorder very to use. If I have to buy a replacement, I will buy the same ""GO_VIDEO DVD/VHS recorder"""
1,"low quality, high cost","These are thin, flimsy, and you only get 1 with your order. I would have sent it back, but I needed a cut card for a poker game I was holding. I definitely do not recommend."
1,Absolutely misleading-SCAM,"This seller posts an absolutely misleading photo. I purchased this product anticipating that I would receive multiple cards, however I only received 1 SINGLE (blue) CARD! Not multiple cards of different colors as the photo indicates. This price for only 1 card is absolutely ridiculous. On top of that, the card quality seemed cheap. This is totally unacceptable."
1,"Sad, depressing story.",Several endangered animals want to board a little boy's train. The elephant says someone is coming to cut off his tusks; the seal says he doesn't have enough to eat in his dirty sea; the bird says they are draining water out of his marshes; the tiger says they are cutting down his forests; and the polar bear says they want to make a coat out of his fur. The boy takes each animal on board the train. It's a bleak story. I think there are much better books than this that address animal endangerment and extinction.
2,Random,"My son picked this book out at the library, he loves it, I think it is the most random and ridiculous story I have ever read. I am writing this only because of the vast number of reviews that either say ""this book is awesome"" or ""this book is way too serious"" it has interesting illustrations, a catch phrase that toddlers can easily memorize, and trains. The animals are weird, and random, and make no sense. The mother is equally weird and random, also somewhat mean. There is no plot whatsoever. It isn't good or bad, its just pointless, but little boys loves trains and random yelling of things. This is the only reason I can imagine it sells any copies at all."
1,Not so appropriate for a preschooler/kindergartener (illustrations are good though),"My kindergartener brought this book home from the library - his very first book to bring home. He was so excited! The illustrations are fantastic - I know that is why he chose it.The story is about a little boy who goes to sleep, and dreams about endangered species wanting to come and ride his train with him, to escape dying (basically!). The elephant talks about having his tusks cut off, the polar bear about having his fur used for fur, the tiger about the forest being chopped down, and so on...it is a very depressing book. I believe there are other ways to teach children about how to be good to the environment, and nature, rather than laying all this on them - they can not do anything about it at this young age!I do not recommend this book. It was a waste of time.Mom of three under the age of 5!!"
1,Awful.,"First the good news. The art is beautiful. This is a lovely book. If it had no words, I would recommend it enthusiastically.However...On the first and last pages, the mother is rude. In the rest of the book, you can see that her son has been paying attention, because he is rude.And then you get the politically correct dreck. ""'I live in the frozen North and somebody wants my fur to make a coat out of, and soon there will be none of us left,' says the polar bear."" Um, was my five year old considering buying a polar bear fur coat? No? Then how is this frightening scenario useful to him? It isn't. It's propaganda. It is the least subtle propoganda aimed at small children that I've ever read.Gawdawful."
3,"Good story line, too adult art work for children under 6","The story line of this book is great, and it did win a Parent's Choice award for Illustration. I can understand PARENTS giving this book an award for illustrations. However, when I read it to my 3 1/2 year old twin grandsons, they panned the art work! I have to agree with them. It is too ""artsy"" for children. At times very pastel, to the point of fading away, and at other times too dark and foreboding. One ink drawing of criss crossing lines was especilly puzzeling. You can barely see the train in it for the dark heavy lines. In fact, the train, seems to fade out, is too dark to see, is too small, or too pastel on almost every page. Trying to explain the illustrations became the focal point of the book, which I am sure was not the author's intent.In short. While the story line is great, the illustrations make this book more suitable for children 6 and older."
4,Little Tike Tank RPG.,This game is actualy pretty fun. It's like an RPG with Tanks. But the tanks look like micro machines. The graphical detail is very low but it's enough for the $9.99 Price. The entire game is worth 9.99. So perhaps you should try it?
4,Great Game But ALOT of problems,This game is very good AND VERY EASY If you have this game get The panther Tanks its the best or stug they are good tanks this game is worth every penny If someone sold this game for $20 this game is ripPROS-EASY FUN AND HAS COOL WEAPONS ID YOU LIKE CUSTOM ROBO YOULL LOVE THIS GAME LIKE RPGCONS- TERRIBLE GRAPHICS (ITS BAD CAUSE PS2 GRAPHICS ARE TERRIBLE)NO CHALLAGE SOME TANKS IN THIS GAME ARE OVERPOWERED LIKE STUG.Get this game the game is not really good (at least its better than other crappy ps2 games)
3,Transformers car,"Not good for a younger child. Very difficult for even myself to change this from car to robot. Pieces keep coming off when you don't want them to. Does not ""transform"" well. Not sturdy at all. Not even a good car when used just as a car. Disappointing!"
4,Great toddler book,Nice easy to lift flaps with simple bright pictures. My toddler really likes this one.
3,Not great quality material,This is not very old and it has pills all over it already. Definitly a low thread count material.
1,Doesn't do the trick,"This product is supposed to take the shine off exposed or shaved areas of scalp in a balding or shaved man. However, it doesn't make any difference in my case."
2,Not satisfied,"Still left considerable shine on my head. I have not used any other similar products, but I would try something else.."
3,Can't stop SERIOUS shine,I had overhead lights creating a powerful sheen that was very visible on the webcam. This cut it only a little. I cut off the lights and went for indirect lighting instead.
5,The best book around on Vintage Erotica!,"All the photos are old-time nudes and erotica but the images from the mid 1800's are astonishing. Nudes, kink, even sexual stuff!The material is presented along with some excellent and insightful commentary. All in all this book is amazing value and highly recommended!"
3,"Not Erotic, But Historically Interesting","This is a strange look into the past when photography began. Naturally, men wanted to photograph women in the nude and ""in the act."" I say it is ""strange"" because many of the women are ugly or dowdy with bodies that are undesirable, to say the least. Few knew how to pose at the time and many of the ladies seem almost pathetic in their lack of artifice. One cannot escape the idea that the viewer may be looking at an ancestor and - also a jarring thought - the vast majority of the women (and men) in this book are dead. If you want a haunting reminder of days past and that we are all mortal, buy this book. If you're looking for erotica, this isn't it."
4,Bookopoly: Fun and educational,This is a fun board game for those who love monopoly with a literary twist.
5,Bookopoly,This game was purchased as a Christmas game for the family so we have not played it yet. We are looking forward to it.
3,out of date,"Ah, the book that started it all. Gotta love Uncle Fester. I think Secrets of Methamphetamine Manufacture is on its 7th edition now. This one doesn't include making methamphetamine from ephedrine I don't think. If I'm not mistaken, the ephedrine recipe didn't come out until the 3rd edition, and even then the ratio of iodine, red phosphorus, water, and ephedrine was off."
2,Disappointing ramblings on cannabis,"I was looking forward to some profound insights from a hashish using philosopher. Frankly, I've heard better from a stoned college student. I found nothing of substance in this book. Perhaps some will find it enough that a recognized major modern philosopher regarded hashish as worthy of study and contemplation but I don't."
5,lunix super cluster,"I love this book. After reading it, I became a proficient assembly programmer and I am now able to write interweb applications and stack dequeing algorithms.\\the fact of the matter is, no matter which code you assemble, it is the same for all cpu cores, and the hood remains the same, because the little man inside the computer is poly-lingual. ergo, vis a vis, sempre fi, snafu, concordintly,i recomend that you guys write your own assembler after this, or better yet, a compiler. i hear gcc is the way to gothese jewish programming wizards sure are smart. huzzahlove,A.G."
4,extreme visual stimulation,"this book is for those who find looking into the lives of others fascinating- each page is filled with excitement, energy, and ..... clutter. peek into the lives of the tokyo denizen, each colorful page a revealing study of how people in this large city live. though small in format, the book is always exciting to flip through, each page is a new tale, waiting to be told and explored."
3,Living large,"The small cramped presentation of wonderful photographs of the way real folks live is frustrating but appropriate for the subject. The content evokes college dormroom life by grown ups. New Yorkers will appreciate Tokyo Style; Angelenos will not understand. In view of our growing population, it serves as a model for our future life styles. I may be headed for a studio apartment in the old folks home but I can still have my stuff."
4,Not what I expected,"I have long been interested in Japanese design and how they manage to be so space-efficient in such innovative ways. This book is really not about design ""ideas"" but is really just a snapshot into the everyday lives of ordinary Tokyo residents. Most of the rooms are ridiculously cluttered. Many look unclean. I actually like looking at the book, but not for inspiration. It's more a voyeuristic experience. Shatters a stereotype of mine: I always thought Japanese were ridiculously neat. The apartments featured in this book are disastrously messy. And while some of that is due to space issues, it's also related to strange collecting habits (ie. Hello Kitty and stuffed animals)."
1,A uncertain amount of stuff,"The point of the positive reviews -- that this book gives you a different view of ""clean, tidy"" Japanese -- hardly supports a reason to purchase this book.Look, the photography does the best job it can to show these rooms (often so small that only one or two angles are possible), but photo after photo of seeing people's piles of books, records, manga, dishes? Please -- this is not a book about style. It's a book about people who have no style -- the have STUFF. If you're looking for insight into the real homelife style of Japanese, in this book you're mostly going to be seeing only a blur."
1,Better Options Out There,"For the price, this noise canceling headset is not worth it. Basically the sound lacks any sense of fulness and the active noise canceling is subtle at best.If you prefer a headset that is not over your ear, but an earbud then I would go for any of the Shure headphones. They do not actively noise cancel, but the fit is more comfortable since there are multiple options in terms of size and ear foam material and the sound is noticeably better especially the bass.If you prefer an over the ear headset, I just got the Audio Technica one and they are fantastic. They are not as easy to carry around, but the active noise canceling is comparable to the Bose models out there and at a lower price. All in all, skip the Sony MDR-NC11 or at least set your expectations properly."
3,Not worth the money,I was looking for a good set of headphones to use on flights when I travel and when I work out. On flights I realized that the noise canceling abilities were not all that great.When I work out the headphones would keep slipping out of my ears because of the triangular plastic piece in the cable. Its quite annoying.I am going to opt for a better set of headphones.
2,Durability a big issue,"Similar to another buyer, I've had two pair. They work wonderfully on planes, and even on some of my motorcycle rides in the country. However, the right ear bud has gone out in both. I thought it might be the cord, but no amount of twisting gets it back. Too bad!"
5,Great Product - Still running after 6 years,"I bought this product back in 2006 from Circuit City in Cincinnati and have since lived and worked in four countties. This product has travelled with me all through and they are stil working good. It has lessened out noise in every conceivable environments and have been a great great value. $96 in 2006 was a high price but with its long life span, I have got back much more than that.The only thing which wears out are the Ear cushions which can be replaced for $3. A rechargeable AAA (850mAH) needed to power up the noise canceling system has lasted a long time before needing another recharge.A great value product !!"
2,Malfunction/short circuit,"Good sound when it worked. Noise cancelling OK. Mostly worked because of the in-ear buds. Sometimes you have to clean out the holes with something small or you lose sound quality. Recently I developed a short in just the left side, so now it only works intermittently. I tried to open it up and fix it, but the screw on the earpiece didn't really get me to the wires. You would have to break it to get to find the short. Another reviewer says it is over $50 to get a new refurbished one, plus shipping/handling--not worth it. Usually I love Sony products, but this one not so much."
2,Disappointing,"I like Sony products in general and I completely trusted SONY quality. But this time I'm just so disapointed with this pair of earphones. They are uncomfortable to wear, not worth the high price and provide very poor sound quality. I didn't buy them from Amazon. I hope I bought the fake earphones otherwise I really should be careful with Sony products in the future!!!"
1,Do NOT Buy,"This headset from Sony is a piece of garbage! They work great, when they work, but therein lies the problem. I bought my original set in March and by June the left earphone quit working. The unit was still under warranty and Sony was ""gracious"" enough to send a refurbished unit back to me. What a deal, pay for a new unit and get a refurb within 3 months! Now the left side has gone out on the refurb! Since the earphones are now out of full warranty, Sony will replace, for $24, the unit with another refurb! WOW, what a deal, I suppose I get to send Sony $24 every 3 or 4 months to keep replacing what should have worked in the first place. I don't think so. Sony used to make a great product, but apparently not any more. DO NOT BUY! Get the Shure E3c instead; you won't be sorry. Goodbye and good riddance Sony!"
4,"Nice, compact and efficient.","I bought these on a trip to Japan 3 years ago, and have taken them with me on various trans-continental/trans-oceanic flights, and they really help to take the edge off the jet hum which makes the trip far more tolerable. I use regulat MDR-E828s regularly, but save these for when I need them."
2,"Reduces noise, but so do earplugs","Yes, these headphones block noise quite well. Due to the closed design (the plugs make an airtight seal in your ears) wearing them is like wearing earplugs. The problem is, it's also like wearing a stethoscope: touching or jostling the cords produces thumps that have your eardrums crackling under the pressure. Also, turning on the electronics seems to have little further noise-reducing effect: it merely introduces a hiss and cranks the sound volume up a notch. The manual says the noise cancellation works for low-frequency noise only; possibly on an airplane you might notice a difference, but it seems you'd get very much the same effect from any pair of passive closed-design earbud phones for a lot less money."
1,"Horrible Construction, Don't Waste Your Time","Put me in with the crowd that got terribly constructed earbds. I bought my first pair in Feb, within a month the right earbud had died. I sent it in, got a new pair (at the end of April no less), and now it's the end of May and the left bud in the new pair has died.This is ridiculous."
1,airplane traveling,i just got back from a 7 hr air trip and these ear buds work great. they block out everything from engine noise to small kids. they are easy to sleep with and sound great
5,Little workhorse!,"I love this stove! I originally started backpacking and car camping with a liquid alcohol stove, then converted to a Primus cannister trail stove. I loved it, but due to my age and back, I decided to replace all my old heavy gear with newer, lightweight items. Price and weight were my two concerns. I researched Snowpeak, Brunton, and Primus, and found the price was more than the Coleman F1, and the other stoves had from 8,000 to 11,000 BTUs. This stove has 16,400 BTUs and weighs only 2.7 oz. I ordered from Amazon, and am so glad I did! Two cups of water for my Lipton pasta reach a rolling boil in under two minutes, then I reduce the flame to a light simmer for a few more minutes. Boil time for 1 liter is about three minutes. This stove performs amazingly, easy to use, great flame adjustment, little boil time, and packs down to a 2 inch pouch. What more could a camper want?"
3,Two Year Usage,"I've gotten about two years use out of this stove. It is small and lightweight. The three prongs that hold pots do require some fiddling with each time the stove is assembled. If done improperly, their spacing will be uneven creating a situation where a pot could fall off. Pay attention and it'll work. Then again, if you're outside and it's really cold, assembling the prongs is a pain. I have never had something fall off of the stove, so the prongs are strong enough to hold reasonable sized pots of water.Unfortunately, the stove stopped working. After returning home from a hunting trip early because we could not cook food, I hooked it up and it ran fine. Back to the woods, and it stopped working again after two meals. A canister change didn't solve the problem. Fuel flow would start, the stove would light, then it'd stop.So, the stove works for awhile. Then, it's gonna fail. I'm in the market for another stove and will not buy this model again."
3,"It's a fine stove, however there's no ""push-button electronic ignition for matchless lighting""","This is a good compact stove that uses the Propane/Butane mix fuel cans. However there is no ""push-button electronic ignition for matchless lighting""! contrary to the product description. Should have known it's too good to be true."
3,has a design issue,"I really like the small size and weight of this stove. It is simple to operate and reliable. However, to break it down, you unscrew it into two pieces. I have had a problem where there are actually 3 pieces and the wrong two get separated such that the 3 prongs are stuck in their separated position, and now after some use it will not separate at all because it is siezed at the threads. This means it no longer packs small and you run the risk of bending the prongs. It is still functional, but does not break down properly. I have not been able to fix this problem."
2,Plastic...,"Why ruing a good stove with a little plastic part? I tried to remove this little plastic ring to see if i could somehow manage to operate the stove without it.. For my big surprise plastic came out to be very fragile, i broke one of the 3 little holders...If it brakes completely, i'll buy Pocket-Rocket from MSR as a replacement."
4,Devastatingly sad,"Certainly this book is written very well. The translation is amazing. The story is intriguing. But it brings out the horrors of the holocaust in a way that I found too much to absorb. He explores the most bestial -- even worse than bestial -- human tendencies in a way that no other book can approach. He also links that horror to the horror all people are capable of if they descend to their lowest level.That said, if you want to read in a fictionalized format something that presents detail after detail of the behavior of Nazi war criminals, this could be for you."
2,Couldn't Get Into It,I bought this book because the summary made it sound very interesting. I found that I just couldn't get into it. I did not like the author's style of writing and found myself skimming a lot of it until I finally gave up. The characters were interesting but I had a hard time keeping the relationships straight and probably didn't read enough to understand the point of the book. I never finished it.
2,Our Holocaust,I've had a really difficult time getting into this book. I can't seem to understand why it is titled as it is. Perhaps when I go back and read the chapters I'v read this far it will make more sense.
2,All over the place,"I'm not sure why they were saying this was a ""funny"" book. I couldn't follow the story line; and I found nothing cute or funny about it. As a matter of fact, I didn't finish it, which is a very rare thing for me to do; no matter what, I finish a book, but this one - achhhh."
1,Boring,I read abut 1/4 of this book but it was so boring I couldn't continue. I couldn't understand the point of this book.
4,Lots of crunch!,"Complete Warrior was the first ""Complete"" book I got, and is still my favorite. It has tons of crunchy bits. Yes, much of the stuff is 3.5 revisions from Sword and Fist and Masters of the Wild, but it is useful none-the-less. In 3e many of the classes and feats in those books were overpowered and no sensible DM should have let them be used as written, some of those 3e failings were corrected in Complete Warrior.As always, a sensible DM should not allow their players to use anything out of any book they bring to the table. If you don't want hulking hurlers, all you have to do is not allow large size characters or say no--easy. My advice, cut the cheese, as a DM. If it sounds cheesy and hard to incorporate, DON'T LET ANYONE DO IT! Let your spoiled players whine and cry, and keep delivering a good game."
4,Solid addition to any D&D Library.,"Like the thrill of close combat? Enjoy sneaking around in an attempt to find the best angle to sink your dagger into an enemy's back? Then the Complete Warrior is for you. This book goes into great detail about how to be an offensive fighter in a D&D; group.Pros: Lists a plethora of prestige classes accompanied by beautiful graphic depictions, gives an experienced player more fantastic material for their higher-level characters. Also includes multiple new basic starting classes to choose from. Talks about a variety of tactics to use in-game during combat. All-around a good addition to those who lean toward creating Fighters, Rogues, Rangers, Paladins, etc.Cons: Not enough basic starting classes added. The types that were added don't have the same feel to me as the classics, such as the new Samurai class, and I will probably will only use one (the Swashbuckler) in the future."
3,"Necessary, but a little dissapointing",It contains enough new content that it is practically necessary (esp for any LG players out there) but it contains so much rehashed old information it should almost have been 1/2 price for anyone that has Sword and Fist et all.
4,Limited Use,"This book is more than just another collection of prestige classes that you'll likely never use. There is good material for adding lethality to rogues and spell-casters as well as expanding the more traditional fighter-types. Of course there are the prestige classes that no one will ever really use, but there are also plenty that are well thought out and might actually be useful in the average campaign.Art and production quality are outstanding.5 stars for me personally because I favor a low-magic game and this stuff is perfect for that.4 stars in general, because much of this will have limited applicability to the average game."
5,Sweeeeeeeeet!!!!!,This is sweet addition to any campaign whether it is used for a martial(as sugested in the book) or any type. I love that the added the Samurai as a Character class and added a unique array of prestige classes from a Rage Mage to the Ravager.Also the tactical feats a real awesome. The feats allow the use of more mudane feats to give unique abilities. There is too much info to absorb it almost seems like.I say that the best timeto buy is now while it still is 60 percent off.
3,"Solid resource, especially for v3.5","(3.5 stars) This is a great collection of new and previously-published material for players and DMs alike. For those complaining about the cherry-picking from other titles, I'd much rather have this one resource, completely updated for v3.5, than having to scour older books and magazines full of out-of-date info.The three new core classes (Hexblade, Samurai & Swashbuckler) are solid additions to those in the PHB; the Prestige Classes are pretty diverse, though in some cases rather narrowly targeted; and the new skills and feats are invaluable for anyone interested in truly customizing their combat abilities."
3,A Tad Disappointing,"I picked this up under the mistaken impression that it contained updated prestige classes from all the builder books. It's basically a 3.5 update of the p-classes, feats, etc. from one of those books (Sword and Fist) and related material from Dragon Magazine. There are a few new nifty new bits in here. It's a nice resource to have around and it can inspire some neat character concepts and campaign ideas. The section on War in the back is poor and doesn't really fit into the rest of the book well. All told there wasn't quite enough content here to justify the $26 to me. This is still a good book for someone who is a frequent and hardcore gamer. This is a poor choice if you're a twice-a-month gamer or have a small budget."
3,For the less subtle . . .,"This book is a fine resource, especially for players who have just become familar with DnD but not quite ready to tackle the use of magic. A great deal of the information in this book deals specifically with the martial side of DnD, and provides interesting ways not only to develop a martial character but also to run a martial campaign.There are a few glitches. Prestige classes like the Frenzied Berserker are relatively useless when one can multi-class as a barbarian, especially considering that battle frenzy does not stack with rage inasmuch as it is not rage but something wholly different.Some of their newer, more martial deities need a little work or, perhaps, more coverage."
2,"haven't seen it yet, just some thoughts","From the Editorial Review: ""This title was not only compiled from various D&D; sources, but contains new features as well ..."" Hmm. This sounds suspiciously familiar to me. How much new stuff was in D&D; 3.5? Didn't D&D; 3.5 make enough money for Wizard$ of the Coa$t/Ha$bro? My feeling is that if you like stuff about warriors, you already have a lot of the sources from which the (likely) greatest part of this book was drawn ... but they are adding a little new stuff to make you give them more money.Don't get me wrong. If I had unlimited funds, I wouldn't mind giving some (well, a lot) of it to WotC. D&D; 3.0 was better than sliced bread, in my opinion. But I do want to encourage others to think critically about what's being pushed on them. Don't be a sheep!A summary of contents is available at http://www.enworld.org/."
2,disapointed,"this book is at best for serious collectors and new players.if you've played D&D for any lenght of time you'll recognize some of the material from previous supplements and whats left just is'nt good enough to warrant the cash,if you can get a lend of it of a friend or elsewhere then do so as it has some mildly interesting bits and pieces but nothing ground breaking"
5,Great Product,This product was exactly as advertised. It looks very elegant and makes a beautiful impression. I am happy with this product and would purchase it again from this vendor if I needed to replace mine.
4,my favorite childhood book,"I have been looking for this book since 1980. I read it in 7th grade and was fascinated by the relationship btween the boy and the wolf. I HAVE NOT LOCATED IT UNTIL NOW. I WILL READ IT AGAIN TO SEE HOW MUCH I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RECALL SINCE 7TH GRADE; I DO KNOW IT WAS THE FIRST BOOK OF MY LIFE THAT I READ FROM COVER TO COVER WITHOUT PUTTING IT DOWN! TO THIS DAY, I HAVE A FASCINATION WITH WOLVES AND NATURE AND I AM NOW IN THE FIELD ON CONSERVATION BIOLOGY BECAUSE OF THIS EXACT BOOK! I CAN'T WAIT TO GET A COPY AND READ IT AGAIN AND ADD IT TO MY PRIZE COLLECTION. THANKS FOR HELPING ME LOCATE IT AFTER ALL THESE YEARS!"
5,really good,"this Lego set is great. it comes with 4 lego people, and the structure of the set is easy enough to build. It just, in my opinion, isn't big enough once it's built. I like big, exciting lego sets to play with once the set is built, and this set just isn't big enough. but it is exciting and fun. buy it!(not for children 4 and under, the pieces are choking hazards)"
4,waging the war on irresponsible design,"First rate compilation of well-known and not so well-known methods of incorporating sustainable architectural components into your design. This is the official book for the designers and builders of The Benchley Project in Central Texas (a sustainable living community which promotes resource conservation and exploitation). Green designers now have a ""handbook"" that covers a broad spectrum of environmentally driven design issues."
1,Watch out on this one.,"Later in his career Charley Pride did a massive recording session where he re-recorded all his biggest hits.At the time it was well intentioned because almost all of the original versions of these songs were unavailable.But be forewarned, the songs on this disc are all remakes."
2,For Girls Only,"This book should be entitled ""Fitness for Teenage Girls."" Both the information that it contains and its tone are directed exclusively at young women. This is not a bad thing, but be advised that there is nothing for young men here. To be fair, this fact should be obvious from a glance at the book's cover photo.Moreover, while the book contains reasonable advice regarding nutrition, exercise, and body-image, there is nothing to justify the 20+ dollar price. Borrow it from a library."
5,Outstanding,"Easy read with very simple instructions on how to be sucessful at a mowing business. I read this at a library, however I did just notice there is a more up to date version, but only available as an electronic book at greenfromgreen.com. I found this book like a handbook that filled my wallet. I recommend it without reservation."
2,Outdated but informative,"I recieved the above book, although it was a bit outdated the techniques and tribulations seem to have remained somewhat the same. Do not purchase this book if you are new to the business."
3,Compassion for Plants,"The beginning of the book held my interest, but then it waned. Somehow I just lost interest and still have not finished it. But I will try."
3,Good but shorter than expected,Before I got this game I was heavily addicted to Morrowind. Once I finally got this game and played for a while I was disapointed somewhat. After about 9 hours of gameplay I was already the Grey Fox(Grandmaster of the Thieves Guild) and there were very little missions to complete. In Morrowind after at least 20 hours of gameplay I am probably half done with thieves guild missions. I have noticed on walkthrough websites that the number of quests in the game for each section of it(including Main quest) is between 10-15 quests. The graphics are great but It is just not as long as Morrowind.
1,Just can't get into it!!,"Have started this one several times and find the graphics dark and ugly and just can't seem to get into it at all. Am addicted right now to Divinity II which is far superior graphically and game play wise. Don't know why anyone would waste time on this one. Maybe I should give it another try, we'll see."
1,No action... nothing but a bunch of running and empty space,"Man, did this game not deliver or what?!?!?I was extremely excited to get this game and after a good hour, was out of the first dungeon and off to explore...well... nothing but endless landscape of bore. It takes 30 minutes to find anything to do, mind you, 29 of those minutes is checking doors, buildings, and rooms with nothing of interest what so ever. I understand ""finding the action"" is part of the experience of being in a fantasy world but this game takes it way too far. I played the game for a good 4 hours, encountering a total of 27 monsters (18 of which are annoying rats) but more importantly, only 16 minutes of that was action, 19 minutes was searching for loot (the fun kind of searching), and the other 3 hours and 25 minutes was RUNNING AROUND DOING NOTHING!!!!Geez. What a stupid game."
1,Tech support,"This game is great, reinstalling video card drivers over and over, talking to tech support over and over, searching the net for clues to what's wrong with the game - like why is the world completely white? or why is it completely black? or why does my computer crash every time I get to Weynon Priory?They tried to make the most graphically intensive game of all time and what they made was one of the most unstable.You can't return it after you buy it, so don't buy it."
3,A great game on a Console Platform. Beware if you're playing on a PC,"I've played this game on the 360. After that console died by contracting the 'Red Ring of Death', I purchased the game for my PC. I'm running the game on XP with a liquid cooled Intel Duo Core 3Ghz CPU, a nvidia 8800 GTS, and 3GB RAM. I can't play the game more than a few minutes without the game overheating my CPU and shorting out my PC. The game may work well on a top of the line machine (with a Liquid Nitrogen Cooling System), but if you plan to run the game on a mid-level machine - Save your money! For an older title, this game requires a lot of horse power."
3,My Graphical Review #14,"""Even though its nearly 4, it still looks great, forest, water, and architecture stand out like nobodies business. First release on PC, then later to console, this game is very time consuming yet gives you plenty of time to take in the sites. Graphical OrderPCPS3360"""
5,GREAT GAME,"OBLIVION IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I'VE PLAYED,THERE'S NO END TO THE GAME.AWESOME GRAPHICS.THE DELIVERY WAS FAST. THANKS."
4,"It's true, hard core gamers will have no life.","This title, I purchased the day it came out. Since them, I have created character after character. . I'm not sure when it will end.The graphics are quite simply some of the best we will ever see *point to note here, that with the other two add on games with dx10 capability the game is even better*.The character generation is the most comprehensive I have ever seen. You can either go simple, or spend half an hour designing your character.I give it five for addiction and good looks and the length of time you get for exploration and interration which is a seriously long time. It loses a star overall because of the other characters. They are *ok* but sometimes the voice acting is just uninspiring.Half Life 2, whilst not comparing, had very good character interractions. Oblivion seems to have spent the money on everything else and left the people out. It's ok, I forgive, I'm about to create another character ;)"
5,Welcome to a new world.,"Oblivion is not just a game, it is an experience. You will become part of a new world that makes the one you currently live in, well ... bland. Experience many quests and adventures. Build your character with smarts & street savvy. This is not a game you win, because when it is over, the experence is over. This is a game you are only winning when you are experiencing its many facets.RPG's used to be top down ""god-view"" games, which I could never get into. This one gives you the option of First-Person, really putting you in the middle of the action.If you like pc gaming, you will not be disappointed."
5,free form gameplay gaoe,"This game was highly anticipated by me and a few friends and once i finally owned it myself, i was pleasantly surprised @ how much freedom they put into the story. great follow-up on the previous games cant w8 2 c if theres gonna b a new one"
5,MasterWork,"This is one of the best computer games ever. It is a MasterWork, a game the fulfills the vision of a company that knew where it was going, but just now has the horse power to get there. The character creation, the ability to choose to do or not do anything. I once was so lost in this game that I thought after finishing a quest I felt as if I had been at sea, it took me a few seconds to realize I was just sitting in front of a computer screen, the immersion is that deep. Try a Redguard Barbarian and enjoy this game!"
3,Good but not good sizing,"I've had this book for a few years, through I haven't done all the projects in it, mostly used it for hats. The adult's hats have always worked out well for me, but now with a baby in the family to knit for, after several hats for her, double checking my measurements and making sure I had the right stitch gauge, they still came out way to big. This christmas I knit two hats meant to fit 18 months-4 years old and both hats fit me with plenty of room.Wishing I had read other reviews that mention this before I knit them! I still recommend the book, but don't trust the sizing so much!"
5,must have,I've had this book for several years and love it! This book allows me to knit using all kinds of scrap yarns. I love that I can easily figure out the gauge to make any size with any yarn. The finishing techniques are easy to understand and have clear simple illustrations. If you like the freedom to create your own pieces this is a great reference.
4,A Good Designer's Template -- Knitting Library Essential,"I can sew and have designed my own clothes for years. When I learned to knit, I complained to a knitting friend that what I really needed was a ""sloper"" for knitted garments from which to design my own sweaters.A few weeks later, this book arrived in the mail. (At the time I'd been knitting perhaps three months -- very much a beginner).This is a good basic pattern book. It's not meant to give you hundreds of sweater designs but multiples sizes and gauges of a basic pattern from which you can design your own creations.If you need exact instructions to make exactly what you see on the model, this is going to be a dull book after you learn to knit well. However, if you need a basic template as a jumping off point, this book is for you."
3,Not as Handy as I'd Hoped,"I was really looking forward to this book, had my library order multiple copies and everything, only to be disappointed. I was looking for an update of Barbara Goldstein's out-of-print ""All Sweaters in Every Gauge"" and really this book doesn't even come close to the versatility and depth of that book. I like the binding, however, and think that a covered spiral bind is the best bet for a reference-type book such as this that needs to hold up to years of hands-on use. But this book just doesn't have enough variety. Where are the raglan patterns, for instance? I have a...leaflet booklet from Patons that has more to it than this."
4,Read Directions through before knitting.,"At first it was difficult following the directions as written, but then I got used to the method. Once I was done knitting the first mitten, I realized it was fairly easy."
3,Not a Useless book,"This book does have it's usefulness I suppose, for people that like to pick a size then do a gauge swatch then change needles. then need a strict pattern that doesn't encourage any personal growth in your skill level. I learned to express myself with my knitting by reading Elizabeth Zimmerman's ""Knitting Without Tears"" years ago and strongly recommend it if you want to learn to love whatever you're knitting, and relax and knit.This book does have nice pictures, and is easy to read. The binding is great and lays the book open nicely flat so you don't have to find something to hold it open while you're trying to knit. That is a real pluss."
2,Lack of Clarity,"When I first read about this book, I was really excited about finding a pattern resource where I'm not tied to the given gauge. Sadly, awkward phrasing, unclear directions, and outright mistakes in the patterns prevent this from really being useful.Does the phrase ""every 2 rounds"" mean the same as ""every other round"" (a phrase she uses elsewhere in the same pattern) or does it mean knit two rounds and then make the change (essentially every third round)? I only found I'd guessed wrong after my mitten's thumb gusset was sticking out from the middle of my index finger. (So, if it does in fact mean the same as ""every other round,"" why on earth not just pick one term or the other?)If you do use this book, expect to make a practice piece on which to catch all the pattern's mistakes before starting your actual work."
3,A useful book for beginning or intermediate knitters,"I like the concept, layout, and the types of items covered in this book. My main criticism is that it offers only set-in sleeves for the sweater pattern. I would have probably given the book 5 stars if the author had, somehow, included the instructions for substituting raglan, dropped, or saddle shoulder construction. I was (obviously, from the three-star rating I gave it) very disappointed with this omission, although it may have been too complex a change to include. Other than that, I really do like the book and recommend it to aspiring designers. A book of basic patterns is a great addition to any knitter's library!"
1,Not a reliable book!,"I knitted a gauge swatch and followed the chart correctly according to my swatch. My gauge was 6 stitches per inch and I wanted to knit a hat for a 0-6 month old baby, so I casted on 100. This hat came out huge, not snug at all, it just flairs out at the bottom of the hat! By the look of it, I really should have casted on like half that, 50 stitches. But I followed the chart instead of going with my judgement. It really makes me sceptical to trust any other chart numbers in this book!"
3,Basic knitting patterns,"This book has basic patterns that beginners can learn from but it still lacks complete glove instructions and does not show how to knit each glove, right and left. There is a difference when knitting right and left and it is not always easy to understand how to reverse the pattern for the other glove."
3,Interesting but patterns are not sufficient,"A good reference for beginners. However, personally feel it is more like a summary of patterns & sizes previously published in the magazine. Would have preferred if they could include items not published before. The range of hats and sweaters are few and not much of interest. Would have looked forward to new patterns or something interesting made available so that even an advance beginner can plan to do their own knitting."
2,Too Complicated,"This is one of the worst knitting books I have ever read. The patterns, you'd think, would be fairly simple since they're only common items like scarves and mittens. I've been knitting for quite a few years and I had a hard time reading the patterns. I felt like I was looking at a math book, not a knitting patterns. I even showed this book to my mom who has been knitting for over 30 years and she said she wouldn't attempt these patterns the way they were written out. If I was a new knitter looking for a pattern I would be instantly turned off of knitting if I saw this book. Way too complicated."
3,"Decent remote, but not perfect","This remote does what is claims to do, so there are no surprises, but it definitely could be improved. First, it's really picky directionally, so you have to actually point it directly at the clock radio, not easy when you're lying in bed. Secondly, the lack of a sleep function for dozing off at night is for me a glaring omission; who wants to get up out of bed once they start to get sleepy or finish reading just to turn on the sleep feature?"
3,It works as advertised.,"It works well, I just wish it could navigate through the iPod's menu. To change albums you have to physically do it on the iPod itself. Otherwise it just does volume and playback controls. It works, not much else."
2,Lame remote for iHome,"The buttons don't have that clicky button feel, so you press and you're like ""did it go?""... The labels are hard to read, icons take a little figuring out. Honestly I use it for turning on/off, and if I want to do anything else I go up to the iHome to adjust it."
2,Support not there,"THis bra is pretty disappointing. I purchased it because it was the only affordable nursing bra I could find in my size, 32 G. The band size runs large, the cup size is definitely small. It is comfortable, but it doesn't give my bust nearly enough support to feel good wearing it out of the house."
5,THE LEGEND CREATES A LEGENDARY MIX!!!,Mr. C from the Shaman has created an amazing mix of exclusive tech house tracks. I think this is a set he spins at his club The End in London. The fact the artists on this album gave him exclusive tracks says it all. This IS underground London partying.
5,Daver,"At a time when it is hard to hear country in country and western music, it has been harder still to hear the western! I love the title track to this album as it really hits the nail on the head. Listen up music producers out there; we're still here! Joni writes and performs music we're all hungry to hear but is impossible to find on the radio. Fortunately, there are a few of us diehards on the internet that allow the rest of us to catch a glimpse of what has always been great music. Joni's voice, mix of songs, and outstanding musicians create a listening experience worth looking for. In this CD I have found songs that are not only fresh but are true to the ideals that are close to hers and a lot of America's heart. Thanks, Joni, for stickin' to your guns as I will be returning for more and spreadin' the word!"
4,Helpful Holders,"I am a longtime homeschooling mother and have now used this item for about 2 years. This item has been very helpful in regards to organizing workbooks that don't have 3 holes punched into them. I use 3 ring binders and then slide the workbooks into the magazine holders which I then place in the 3 ring binders. These are a must for any homeschooler. The only downside is that the plastic isn't a strong as i would like. If the binder is dropped then the holders may break just from the impact thus the 4star rating. Otherwise, i highly recommend these as an organizational tool. M Critz"
3,Didn't Fit,"I thought the larger measurement given was the length of the hole through which the magazine would fit, but it is not so my magazines do not fit them. I will have to find some other means of storing my magazines."
4,Price is very high,I use this product regularly. The normal list price for this item is $4.90. Office Depot used to carry it at less than $4. Why is it $20 on Amazon? Seems way out of line to me.
1,don't waste your money,I bought 12 of these mre heaters and noticed on the heater a date of us1990 oh.Not one of the 12 heaters worked don't waste your money.
1,dont waste your money,seriously....don't waste your money. This bag did not last long as the handles broke from the bag. What a waste.
3,not bad,does the job. Wish it had a couple more pockets to hold smaller items. Good for the price though.
2,Expiration date,"I ordered a tube of Viractin cold sore gel, and when it arrived today it has an expiration date on it of February 2011. It would appear to me that this is old stock. Since this is October 2010, and the product is only used a couple of times a year, the product will be expired before it is even partially used up. Not a good buy!"
5,Perfect for the little ones who love firefighters and fire trucks!!,"I made this purchase to replace a school library's copy of the book that had been read beyond repair. My hope is that this copy of the book will also be read, and read, and read some more!"
1,"Nice looking, but couldn't wear it!","This is a nice looking lanyard, however, it pulled the hair on my neck and I couldn't wear it more than 5 minutes. I had to return the item. On the plus side, customer service was very friendly."
2,Does not stay together,"If you are considering this set as a collector, that is a different thing entirely. But if you are considering this set for a child (or even an adult lego enthusiast)be forewarned that this set is very frustrating. The pieces themselves are very durable because it is after all ""Lego"" and will probably last forever; however, it is very difficult to get the pieces to stay put when building (and not fall apart in your hands) and you cannot play with it after building. You can't move it at all, or it will collapse on you. Maybe you will have a different experience, but I wanted to share mine, because my child was very distraught about this toy."
5,"Best Sound System For The Cost, Hands Down","You will not find a better sound system for the cost, or even comparable cost anywhere else on the market. The sound is absolutely fantastic, with rich, deep bass that makes the walls in my apartment shake. The speakers are larger than they may appear in the picture; they're about the size of a large book, like a Bible. The receiver has a great many modifiable characteristics, including balancing the strength of the various speakers throughout the room. If this is in your budget, buy it today. If it's not in your budget, make some room for it, you won't be disappointed!PS. Check out consumer reports for extra verification."
4,Absolutely beautiful pulp,"I read this book in one sitting, drinking coffee and chuckling the entire time. The book isn't really deep, i.e. I know no more about big metaphysical things like ""the nature of the mind"" or ""the human condition is pseudopoverty"" for having read this book. But it was a fun little book with several real-close-to-brilliant moments, e.g. one female character's flat stomach fetish, the Tarantino impersonators, and the whole bit about transmission types being masculine and feminine. Also, the ""fat Welsh tart"" is funny without being a parody, something that is all too rare in literature these days. I think the best way to put it is that it is too good to read on an airplane, but not a classic."
4,"Very British, very funny, very well written","If you are in London, this book is inescapable. Advertisements are in the Tube and on taxis. It's deserving of the publicity. Written at an engaging pace, oddly punctuated, and filled with Central London landmarks, the book draws you in. Faced with a dead end life and a career in the accountancy, our hero has ""The Plan."" He invites a terrific cast of friends to try and pull it off. The brilliant and complex plan is slowly revealed, culminating it its bizzare execution. If you don't speak ""British"" or know your way around London, you may be occasionally lost, but stick with it. You won't be sorry"
3,"Details, Details","People looking for ideas on what to serve and gifts to give for Kwanzaa will find good suggestions in this book. The book also includes a helpful pronounciation guide for Kwanzaa terms. But I was disappointed to find two critical errors: 1) the author instructs that the green candles are placed to the left of the black candle in the Kwanza Kinara (candle holder) when it is the red candles that go to the left -- as illustrated on the book's cover. 2) The author advises that Kwanzaa feast, or Karamu, is held on the 6th day of the holiday, when it is held on the seventh and last. Everything about Kwanzaa relates to seven -- seven principles, seven symbols, seven days. DUH! Unfortunately, those key errors dampened by enthusiasm for the rest of the book."
3,Capsicum pills,"Well shipping was fast,got the pills took them the first week noticed a little heart burn but i started noiticing inches melting away !!!"
2,It's okay,"It works good at heating up your stomach, but I haven't seen a great lose in weight while taking it."
3,Banshee,"Having just seen the trailer for Banshee!!! on the ""Assault of the Sasquatch"" dvd, I knew this was a can't miss. Being a long-time veteran of SyFy made for TV films, the fine output of ""mock-busters"" from the Asylum, and countless classic B-Movies this one is right up my alley. Is the plot original? Some teenagers on spring break and some townies face down a slasher/monster. Are the effects any good? Not too bad if you like some gore mixed in with your computer-generated monster.(mind you I have seen some really bad effects) How is the acting you might ask? Again for this type of movie, not terrible. Production values? Perhaps a little on the cheap side... maybe a whole lot. Final verdict? For a low budget film, Banshees!!! manages to entertain the way a good bad movie will. Ridiculous character deaths abound. Plot holes that manage to amuse while leaving you to scratch your head. A fun movie to watch with friends."
4,Pretty good movie,"This is yet another movie i have seen by Synthetic Cinema International which was formally an independent company out of Connecticut, but now they work with Warner Bros, NBC, ChillerTV, esc. This movie was pretty good. My favorite movie from this company had to be ""Assault of the Sasquatch"", however i did like this movie. Colin Theys was the producer and Video editor, and he did a really good job with both. Except i have to say the Digital effects were better then the actual movie itself. The banshee looked very real and the gore scenes were well done. If you like indies, slashers flix, and Shawn and MJ AKA Coolduder on Youtube then you should see this movie!"
5,Thank you for selling this --- I can't find it locally,"A big thank you for continuing to cary this much needed item. I'm allergic to most deoderants but I can use unscented Ban. Of course if you have medical problems, and are considering purchasing this product, check with your medical practioner first.The only place I can purchase this product is through Amazon.com.Thank you, thank you!Oh, yes, the deoderant does work as advertised."
4,Sweet dreams,"This is great for relaxing or falling asleep, but lately, I put on ""Tranquility"" first thing in the morning while I do my office paperwork. Gets me moving gently into the day and soft enough to please others around me. The entire Sound Therapy series is great, though my utter favorite is ""Serenity"" which I really like the best of the group of albums. Your results may vary. Take a listen."
3,"GREAT idea, but...","This is a great idea, and in most instances I find it quite useful. However, I bought it to transfer large files which I cannot transfer via a 16Gb USB stick, and the CrossBox has a 4Gb file size limitation!!! Basically, if you transfer a 40Gb file, it takes the time it actually would need to do it all, but at the receiving end the file is truncated at 4Gb... Too bad. A poor execution of a great idea."
1,A sad waste of good trees,"The writing is sophomoric (complete with parenthetical asides,) at times quite plagiaristic and any thesis is totally non-existent.It is a collection of pointless self-focused memoirs, out-sourced interviews and slapped together ""Do-it!"" list, which I assume were to justify the whole ""Revolutionary Plan"" marketing pitch.It was so poorly written I want to cry.I assumed while reading this book that it must have been published by Rodale and was shock to find no nepotism involved. It makes me very sad for the state of the publishing industry.As far as I can tell, it's a justification for reading romance novels, since this was mentioned at least once in every chapter."
1,No Substance,"This is a very odd collection of writings meant to help others overcome guilt. The two authors never speak directly about their own guilty feelings; such as the mother, Maria, never explains her decision to keep her daughter's biological father away from her and how they both feel about it. They spend much of book trying to convince the reader (or themselves, it is hard to tell) that reading romance novels is a feminist activity. They love romance novels so much, maybe they should try their hand at one--this book is a flop!"
3,"Faith of Our Fathers, Vol. 2 Review",Volumn 1 was MUCH better. I knew most of the hymns from my childhood Catholic school days. I had many pleasant memories from hearing again these old familiar hymns. Most of the hymns and music from Volumn II I didn't recognize and consequently couldn't appreciate.
3,entertaining,This nice short (10-15 minutes) is entertaining if you like zombies. It shows a family doing all the wrong things
4,Bridget's Review,I found out from my dad that this was a remake of George A. Romero's The Crazies. Everyone I know who saw this movie liked it. It was definitely worth two hours of my time.
3,zombie land small town Iowa,"Eh, it was ok. Not the best movie ever or the best zombie one, it did have a few entertaining parts, but also predictable too. Gory & violent, really short too. Was worth a rental, wouldn't buy it though."
2,Oh Horrors! Is it really Timothy?,I believe that in every actors career there is at least one film that they sincerely wish they had not made. Could this one be Timothy's? This was a very insipid poor excuse for a horror movie and one that is easily forgettable. Unless you are a die hard Oliphant fan don't bother.
2,"Good movie, but inconsistent in loading","Good movie, but inconsistent in loading. Purchased another because previous did not work consistently in Blue-Ray player. Same problem. No other movies with issue. Have over 500 in library. Will work, but not, just plan on an alternate."
3,Well made but routine paranoid horror movie,"A well made but rather routine paranoid horror movie. Nothing new to see here, but a very good paint-by-numbers product."
3,"Interesting Premise, Poorly Done","It was all I could do to make myself finish watching the movie. The premise is extremely interesting -- a small midwestern town's water supply gets infected with a virus that causes people to flip out. The government steps in and quarantines the town. That sounds good. However, the execution is really bad. There is no story-building; you basically just flip from scene to scene. I wish the director/producer had taken the time to actually build a story. You really couldn't care less about any of the characters because you haven't gotten to know them. Further, there are too many contrived situations that really take away from the believability. To add insult to injury, there is too much reliance on gross-out/gore to get attention rather than actually developing the perfectly good plotline to get the attention. In short, I think the director/producer were suffering from a case of the ""lazies"" when they made this movie about the ""crazies."""
5,"Great movie, good ending","The movie starts off fast and keeps going. I never got bored. There were some scenes I would have left out but they didn't hurt the overall experience. If you like zombie type movies, and (SPOILER) the government angle isn't hidden but obvious from the start, I would recommend this movie."
1,The Crazies,"My son finally got around to opening a movie he received for Christmas, it was wrapped in plastic but the case was empty, no movie it is past the return date as there is no option to return or replace any longer. So I rate this as terrible!"
3,It was entertaining,"The Crazies was entertaining, but not amazing. There were some holes in the plot, but the action keeps the viewer interested. We streamed the video in HD from Amazon an found that the audio quality was not very good, and the picture quality varied. We have just started to use Amazon's video services on our TV through the Wii U (before it was just on the iPad) so we're not sure if the issue lies with Amazon's service or the Wii U software."
4,"Not a fan of horror movies in general, but this is well-done","Very Andromeda Strain-esque. Man-made nasty gets dropped accidentally on a civilian population, causing people who are infected to commit horrible, intimately murderous acts. The government has to try to contain it any way possible and goes to extremes. It's very suspenseful, almost believable, relatively well-acted and -directed. No real surprises in the end, but enjoyably keeps you on the edge of your seat. I also recommend 28 Weeks Later."
4,Good remake,"It was definitely tense and fun. Although it is not a masterpiece, it is definitely a good edge-of-the-seat popcorn flick."
4,Rental worthy,This movie turned put to be a lot better than I expected. The story was actually not bad and easy to follow. The gore scenes had plenty of blood and there were somsuspense moments as well.
4,An Adrenaline Rush,"An unknown virus has been spilled from a crashed plane into the water supply of Ogden Marsh. The toxin makes those infected by it go insane. They also become very violent. The sheriff and his deputy are the only ones who can set things right and protect the town. But they are not guaranteed to safe from the infection either.This movie was surprisingly good. It has some good actors, tons of suspense, and a decent amount of pretty good drama. There have been movies like this before, but this is one of the better ""zombie"" movies I've seen. It's not actually a ""zombie"" movie persay. The people actually go crazy; but it may as well be a zombie movie. Either way, it ranks up there with some of the best films in that genre."
4,My co-worker was in it!,"This movie comes almost to zombies which I'm not fond of!No filthy diseased appearence on their faces and I'm sorry but I'm more terrfied rabid of animals or any animal period whose intent is to kill me.Thats really called our ""prey instinct.""But hey, this movie here was fun, and was a bit different in making it less typical!I spoke to one of my co-workers about movies in general and the crazies came up. I was shocked..when she told me that she was an extra in it, getting paid good just for it!! I have to find the scene *.* She told me which, though now I have forgot on the details Xd GAHHH!That and this movie was shot in the very same state I'm living in ^.^"
1,Lame,"Basically, just another Zombie flick. The message they were trying to get across was how the government can just do whatever it wants; however, they really didn't push that issue to make it anything really significant.They made the actors stupid in this movie. They would repeatedly split up causing one or the other to be attacked, and then saved, only to go to the next location and split up again. The woman even sits down in front of a huge restaurant window, enjoying a glass of water (bottle not good enough when you're running for your life), knowing that the crazies and military were looking for them. If people were after me I'd stay out of sight and check every room I walked in."
2,Okay.,"It's okay, the previews coming attractions looked a lot more exciting than the movie actually was. The movie was good, but not as scary as originally thought."
1,don't trust the movie reviews,"you have GOT to be kidding....on so many levels. the government MAKES a disease that wipes out whole populations? then they transport it on a plane and not overland by truck??? the plane it is being caried on CRASHES into a stream that people drink from? the army kidnaps everyone in a small town and THEN kills them AND THEN nukes the city???i like timothy olyphant in Deadwood, he was great in Justified. but if he is going to expect me to watch his movies he had better do better then this!!!"
5,New type of zombie!,"We've been ready for a zombie upgrade for sometime now. This is it! The new improved zombie. Well I can't say much else without giving keys away but if you like zombie movies, your gonna love this one. ;-)"
3,Pretty good remake,"This is one of the few films that are better than the original, the first movie in 1973 was slow and badly acted, it was not George Romero's finest hour, but this movie while not a classic is pretty good,suspenseful and entertaining."
4,"Don't trust your neighbors, trust Amazon","Overall I was very satisfied with the purchase, the film is great and the package was in great hands. The film itself is a great addition to anyone's blu ray collection and is a symbol of what a modern day horror film should be. My only real complaint would be the uncertainty of when the package would arrive. My tracking time said anywhere from 2 weeks to the end of the month and it arrived in the middle of the month. Either way its was a great buy and I highly recommend it"
4,Olyphants craziest,"If you don't expect much, sometimes there is a surprise. I like Olyphant and thats why I took a chance on this movie. I thought it was a very good movie, something that might have been on the B ticket at the theater years ago. It is actually better than that. I passed the movie around to friends and family and they all liked it. With all the really poorly made and ridiculous movies out anymore, this one stood way above them. I recommend it."
5,Really good movie,"This is a great horror movie. There is a good bit of blood and a lot of parts thay make you jump. What I was surprised with though, was that you actually care about the characters, unlike a lot of horror movies. I won't spoil anything for you, but if you buy it you will LOVE it."
3,ok movie,"This movies trailers had me set on it , but I was not very happy with it I expected it to be something like 28days. Beens it took place in a rural town in the U.S. I figured it would be awesome it was just ok."
4,"No expectations going in, (un)pleasantly surprised!","I really enjoyed this movie. Never having seen the original, I am not comparing it to what was, simply what is. I tend to like horror and sci-fi movies that are slightly less formulaic with b- or c-list actors, slightly more plodding story lines and suspense that lies in the acting and narrative more-so than big budget CGI. This film fit the bill. It was genuinely scary in parts and most importantly, I CARED about the characters."
3,"An interesting story, but too derivative to be really enjoyable.","A biological weapon that turns people into homicidal maniacs before it kills them is accidentally released in the small town of Ogden Marsh, Iowa. A small group of survivors manages to elude soldiers and the infected long enough to make it to the edge of town, but they're a long way from safety. The Crazies follows the themes of Carriers and 28 Days Later, examining how people and politics cope with apocalyptic situations; too closely, really, to add anything new to this fascinating theme."
3,Good but nothing special happens.,I like these type of movies and that's the only reason I gave it three stars. I like the main actors I thought they did a good job. But the story line is typical. I won't give anything away. But If you watch these types of movies often you won't see anything different or special. There are some suspensful scenes but nothing really gory or scary happens.
3,3.5 Stars... Fun Horror Flick,"This was actually not as gory as I expected and the acting was fairly decent from both the main actors and supporting cast. The premise wasn't very original, but it was fun, interesting and kept my attention.Lots of fun for a Saturday night movie if you cannot go out to see one!"
4,Are you scared of carwashes?,"(Possible SPOILER alert) This was a pretty cool movie. Horror films aren't my ""thing,"" but I bought this as a gift and the recipient loved it. For this type of movie, it was pretty entertaining and loads of fun. The carwash scene was my favorite part- our heroes enter an old carwash to escape the evil government agency trying to contain them with the other ""crazies"", infected victims of a malicious virus. While the old car is being pulled through the wash, some infected townsfolk attack in a scene that would've made me pee my pants if I were younger. This was a great ""B"" movie for me; the ending was rather far-fetched, even for a reasoning-suspending type film. But the Blu-Ray was great and had tons of extras."
4,Smart remake,Olyphant could fill the void left by Eastwood the actor. He has that calm in the eye of the storm thing going for him. This is a good solid zombie flic. Not great surprises but enough smart moves to keep you watching. Now if they could just stay together.
4,A remake that works,"Too often remakes are simply rehashes of what has come before. Thankfully , that is not the case with ""The Crazies"". This movie completely stands on its own from the original , and can be enjoyed over and over again. In fact , this newer version nearly surpasses the original."
4,A Surprisingly Good Zombie Movie,"I like zombie movies. In the last decade, we've had a number of good ones. Some of these have been remakes and some original creations. Zombie movies range from the funny to the serious, but generally always have a bit of the scare factor. The Crazies, a remake of a 1973 Romero movie, is definitely more on the serious scary side. (I don't care much for the original 1973 movie.) The zombie humor is pretty subtle. Some of the characters' costumes are amusing, but you're going to have to appreciate that without much prodding from the filmmakers.Is The Crazies worth your while? Most definitely. I really enjoyed it. Of these recent spate of zombie movies, I'd rank it very high. The Dawn of the Dead remake being my favorite, I would rank The Crazies as #2. 28 Days Later would probably come in at #3."
3,OK but not great...,"It was an ok movie, but it wasnt that scary. on a scale 1-10 on the scary factor, it was probably a 4 and a half or so. Worth seeing if u like action movies but if you want a scarey movie, then go for the Ring or something."
3,I prefered it to the 1973 version,"It starts off in a bucolic America town and quickly turns into a war zone.Along the way there are elements of paranoia a laInvasion of the Body Snatchersand Romero's( author of the original) trademark Zombie killers. From the trailer I feared it was going to be a gross out Zombie fest, but was pleasantly surprised that it took a more action adventure turn. That's not to say it's safe for the squeamish.Overall the acting and production values are much better this time around.Although the 1973 version came in at 103 minutes I found this version's 101 minutes to be a bit too long. Ultimately the characters weren't compelling enough.I just wanted the script to get where it was going without another detour."
4,"""If this genre is your cup of tea...""","As a zombified festival of gore, this movie is right up there! There were a couple points that kept it from making five stars (in fact, if I could give 3.5...). Namely, the ""crazies"" had varying states of mental acuity even when far along. This was either never explained, or I just missed it. Also, there are several lulls in the action where plot is developed or characters change location... fifteen minutes less would have made for a more harrowing movie... I'm just saying. Two things that make this movie - The deputy (I'd take him for my wingman any day!) and the last couple of scenes! No spoilers here - just sayin' that those two elements are what keep this at a should see level.All the best,Jay"
3,Plausible Zombies,"For a horror movie, ""The Crazies"" has reasonable acting and a plausible explanation for the people going crazy (becoming zombies). The pace was good, not too frantic and not plodding or slow.The cover quotes reviews saying: ""Truly terrifying and suspenseful"" and ""Will scare the crap out of you"". Yes, the movie does build some tension but it certainly doesn't live up to those claims.As far as horror movies go, I would say this is one of the better ones.But for all the lack of flaws, this movie doesn't have anything really compelling either."
5,I love this movie!!,"I'm sorry, but I don't see how people can say this is a bad movie. I've never jumped out of my skin or had my jaw drop so many times during a movie as I did during this one! There's VERY few movies that I can watch more than once and I've already watched The Crazies 3 times this week! I'm now in love with Joe Anderson thanks to this movie and have bought a few of his other ones! Tim Olyphant and Radha Mitchell also did a great job! If you're looking for a zombie movie, this isn't it. If you watch the extras on the DVD, you'll learn that they weren't trying to make this a zombie movie. They actually studied real-life diseases that people get every day and then took off with it from there, which makes it even more creepy. Give this movie a chance! You might be surprised...or scared out of your mind!"
4,28 Days Later + Outbreak,"George Romero's original, low-budget Crazies (1973) is now retold from the villagers' perspective. This version is far better than the original. It's essentially a combination of 28 Days Later (2002) and Outbreak (1995).The logic of this movie is sound. At no time did I question the reasoning of the characters. It's just a good and suspenseful story.Check it out.[DW]"
4,Much better plot than expected,"This movie was pretty awesome. From lines like ""Don't ask me why I can't leave without my wife and I won't ask you why you can"" to the fact that the crazies aren't zombies, this movie is way better than I expected. Thewitty dialogue and the things causing these people to lose their minds made it much more interesting than I thought it would be considering it was marketed as basically a zombie movie.*Possible* spoiler here but not really:The government developed a biological agent meant for population control, which, while being transported by plane, leaked into a towns water supply. The area is quarantined and the ""crazies"" start popping up everywhere, etc. etc.My overall opinion is that it was a very realistic movie in most aspects concerning the government and what potentially could happen somewhere in the world."
3,good solid effort,"i like how they use run of the mill places as the setting for some of the scariest scenes of the film. Particularly, the car wash and the truck stop. Very inventive. Who knew soapy water or an oil changing pit could be so sinister? Overall, a smart horror movie that doesn't assume you're an idiot."
1,Awful!!,"Giving this movie 1 star is almost giving it too much!! It was absolutely horrible!! I tried to see it in the movie theater and ended up walking out (which I never do) because it was sooo bad!! Don't waste your time, or your money!!"
2,Just okay...,"I have to be honest, I wish that I would not have bought this book. I bought it because I was under the impression that I was going to see classy cakes like the cake on the cover. When I opened the book I was confused. Page after page were pictures of sloppy cakes. There are only a few pictures out of the entire book that are worth seeing, for example Margaret Braun's cakes at the tail end of the book. Get her book before you buy this one!"
1,Does not Fit,This was supposed to be the aftermartket replacement however it is not like to old ones so I have to tape them in so I will need to re order the actual
4,not work long enough,three months go buy fast and i have to clean them out by vaccuming them every other dayelectric bill not good
2,smelly filters,"The filters do not have the side clips needed to hold them in place as the name brand filters do...and there is a funny smell in my apartment since I have been using the filters. It should smell fresh, not mildewey."
3,Not a good fit,"Filters have cardboard frame and do not fit in place of the originals for my Bionaire unit without crushing it to a smaller thickness. Looks like it will work, but probably not a good choice if you don't want to force it to fit."
1,Filter smaller than the original.,Filter smaller than the original.The gap can pass unfiltered air.It's difficult to accurately measure and make the appropriate size filter?Beware!
4,Satisfied!!,"The glasses are great! I'm a computer man so I'm using my computer more than 10 hours a day!!! I used to have a headache after working a lot with my laptop and that was the main reason for me to purchase a computer glass. Now I completely forgot the headaches. A great thing about this product is the extremely comfortable frame, sometimes you don't even feel the glasses you are wearing. A disadvantage is the small frame which limits your view, but it's not such a significant problem because these glasses are used for only viewing your computer and it's OK for this purpose."
3,Lets wait and see...,"Have been using these glasses for the past two days. I, however, did not notice much difference. My eyes still get red and exhausted within a couple of hours. I am just gonna have to wait and see if the glasses help prevent any further deterioration of my vision. Fingers crossed. Eyes are precious :(10/10 for shipping service though."
1,Not for people who aren't used to glasses,"The lenses are clear, and the product is made to simply tone down eye strain and glare from the computer, but I got headaches everytime i would use them. I don't use glasses anyway, but I use computers alot and experience a lot of eyestrain. If you aren't used to computers, just shop for a anti-glare moniter."
5,Does indeed make a difference,"I was a bit skeptical when I purchased these, but decided to give them a try based upon the other reviews. After having them for several days, I can say they do in fact make a difference. I would liken the effect of the glasses to turning on Clear Type text in Windows. They reduce the blue light coming from the monitor and the text seems a bit smoother. Are these glasses essential? Absolutely not. Are they nice to have? Yes. At $40 they are a cheap nice-to-have. I'm considering another pair for my laptop bag. One thing to note, the first day these glasses actually made my eyes more tired. I believe it's natural for your eyes to have to adjust to having any type of lens in front of them, so this is not a negative. By day 2 it was a non-issue. I just wanted to point out there may be a short adjustment period. Finally, these glasses are stylish IMHO. Unlink Gunnar's which look, frankly, ridiculous, these glasses look like ""normal"" eyeglasses."
2,Lenses were great. Frames were terrible.,The lenses were great. I noticed a huge difference when looking at my monitor for long periods of time. Unfortunately the frames are terribly cheap. They broke after a couple of months. The part where they screw together just fell apart when taking them off one day.
5,Works very well,"Product works well to block out UV light and harmful rays from crappy LCD monitors. I've been using these glasses for a few months now and haven't had a issue. My eyes aren't as stressed as they were before so I am defiantly noticing a difference. I highly recommend these glasses for people that stare as a computer screen all day. They aren't the most fashionable glasses but who cares if you only use them in front of the computer anyway? I just couldn't justify paying more for the ""better"" glasses available on Amazon."
3,"bargain price, bargain results","These glasses are at a low price and will suit many people. I would advise anyone reading this to consider their budget a second time and look further as well. Ones with metal frames and more expensive lenses (such as the Gunnar brand or others on the VS website) may be better suited for long term use. These glasses have inexpensive plastic frames like you'd get on drug store sunglasses. The lenses are good but mine aren't perfect.Aesthetically speaking the glasses are larger than they appear in the photo. For petite people like myself it looks like a giant visor. Those with larger heads may like it better. Given that the primary use is computer oriented smaller ones with small round lenses would have worked just as well since people face their monitor directly and don't need them for peripheral vision.As for how well they work, they do seem to help but I'm not an optician."
2,frames are woth lees than a penny,"In less then a month frames broke. Not that I dropped them, I used glasses mostly at my office, I would pick it up, and put it back to table before leaving the office. The frames broke so that it's hard to glue it. A product worth more than $50 should at least have frames woth more than a penny."
4,carla meads,Given to my boys who play a lot of video games and my oldest son has a job sitting at a computer all day. They both were pleased with these glasses.
5,Awesome,"These glasses are truly awesome. I've dealt with computer-induced eye strain/headaches for over ten years and had yet to find the right glasses, but I'm truly happy with these. Since I started wearing them about ten days ago, I have experienced a tremendous reduction in eye strain and have gotten no headaches. I wouldn't attribute the changes entirely to the glasses, but they have been a major factor. I would highly recommend them. Two aspects can be improved: (1) the glasses can be made more stylish and (2) the frame can be made stronger."
4,Worth the Investment,"I was skeptical at first when I purchased these; however, I find that the frequency of my computer triggered headaches have decreased significantly. They make a huge difference in the glare from the computer monitors and I find that I can't work without them.They don't take long to get used to, and I have had them for several months and the in terms of quality, they have held up with the constant putting on and taking off when switching from computer to non-computer based tasks."
4,Grat product but feel like i could broke them,"First i work at IT in front of my computer 8 hours a day, then after hours i go to house and use for playing or chatting the computer so 2 more hours, this product help me a lot in keeping my eyes lot less tired, the product works well, but the thing is from the material i feel like i could broke them any day, already dropped them (not on purpose) and nothing happened but i feel they could use some more work on the firmness of the product, but apart from that the product is great for any IT or persona who goes on the computer a lot, great buy."
3,OK for price,Bright little light. Clip is great. The on/off twist is very delicate. The end twists off too easily.
3,NOT QUITE PERFECT,"THIS LIGHT SEEMED TO BE JUST WHAT I NEEDED WHEN I TOOK THE DOG OUT IN THE DARK. HOWEVER, THE CLIP THAT SUPPOSEDLY ALLOWS YOU TO FASTEN IT TO YOUR CLOTHES DOESN'T DO SO. BUT THE LANYARD OVER YOUR HEAD WORKS FINE! THE LIGHT IS REALLY BRIGHT AND IT'S WORTH THE MONEY."
1,Clip broke,"I liked this for the clip, had it clipped onto suspenders. When I reached for it one time, the clip broke and it slipped from my hand into the water. It was not on, so I did not know where it fell in the murky water, and it was a bit deep, so I was not going to fish around looking for it. I will not get this again."
5,Works perfect,"Used on two hunts entering woods in morning. Worked well on both days finding tree stand. Green LED lights very bright. Well constructed, clips well to hat or included head strap. Easy to turn on and off, and nice it can be replaced with regular AAA bats."
3,great light needing better form,"This little flashlight does put out the light. Have used it to get the paper in the morning to checking out work above ceilings to light dim reaches of panels. So far the plastic ball and socket is still solid so that the body doesn't flop out of position, but the non adjustable plastic ball and socket doesn't inspire confidence. Also the use as a headlamp seems to be an afterthought. They put a plastic clip on the end of a relatively heavy body joined by a plastic ball and socket. Then they provide a flex headband with a plastic pocket receiver that only the end of the clip slips onto. It would be better if the clip passed through the receiver completely. You feel the weight of the torch torque against your forehead since the torch is now essentially a semi rigid horn sticking out of you forehead. It works but awkwardly and for how long? But the flashlight itself is a great little illuminator."
3,Not as good as I would have liked!,"The Propet Men's Pedwalder 25 Walking Shoe is a nice shoe, but the pair I bought developed a couple of annoying problems. The velcro on the left strap keeps coming loose, making it problematic to keep the shoe ""laced"" correctly. Not only did the velcro backing pull loose from the material, but the velcro material also pulled out, creating an effect similar to a cotton ball being pulled apart. The result is one shoe that does not fasten correctly. Adding to the problem is the fact that my pants leg catches the tip of the strap when I walk, which tends to pull the strap up. Since it is not ""anchored"" well anyway I end up with a loose shoe quite a bit. The right shoe does not seem to have any of these problems so maybe I just got a dud, but I am not satisfied with this product.In fairness to the Propet people, I do own another pair of Propet shoes (different style) and they are excellent."
4,Propet Men's Pedwalker 25 walking shoe,"I am always looking for a shoe that I can wear all day at work. I am on my feet all day walking, turning, twisting, etc. as an x-ray technologist. This shoe seemed like a good choice, as it has a thick sole, and looks supportive and well made. The shoe felt great at first, but the arch is high, and I have flat feet, so unable to wear all day. I feel the shoe would be great for people with a higher arch."
4,Comfortable but loose,Probably the most comfortable walking shoes I have ever owned. Gave it four stars instead of five because of the loose fit. Would give it 4 1/2 stars if I had that option.
2,Propet MPED25,"Do not like the shoe and do not wear them. I stay in the mood of I will wear them one more time, but still do not like them."
2,Not for Boys!!!!,These glasses are clearly for girls. I found this out only after I purchased them for my son. Not worth returning them but I am very disappointed that it wasn't made clear in the ad that these are packaged for little girls. Very deceptive.
4,An Interviewee,"I'm one of the women Andrea interviewed for this book. Although I don't actively practice Aikido now, it was the foundation for my creating a movement practice called Tantra Tai Chi for Couples. In fact, my Aikido and meditation training with Sensei Robert Nadeau has been one of the most powerful influences in my life.In my own book, I acknowledge Nadeau for teaching me that energy is real and that when I connect with the source of energy within me, I can then connect more fully with my partner. This became very meaningful when I switched my focus from martial to marital arts.Diana Daffner,Author, Tantric Sex for Busy Couples: How to Deepen Your Passion in Just Ten Minutes a Day"
3,"if you want to pratice it , stay away","This book contain a story and interview , very useful but not for praticing. This interview women who ever use Aikido for self-defense, good experience and good example."
2,Stay away of this book,"I bought this book because i buy everything about aikido, since i am an Aikido Sensei myself. There is really no difference between man or women in Aikido. O-Seinsei Ueshiba Morihei created a martial discipline, rather than a way to fight. There is no use of strenght, there is just timing, focusing and a lot of concentration in Aikido. Your sex really makes no difference. There is however many differences between women and men. And that's really what this book is all about. So, especially if you are a woman that want to know what can be aikido on your life, don't buy this book. If you are a woman that want to complain about how difficult is to be a woman in the world of men, well, buy it. That is the book for you. If you are a man, do yourself a favor and stay away from this book."
1,Terminator 2 Time of Trouble.,"This book has no real story to it. I figured it would and it disappointed me greatly. Russell Blackford is a good author, buthere he slipped. The story goes to Jade's world and we see a Skynet that seems almost unbeatable. But it is defeated by a combined effort on the part of the main characters of the storyJade, the Connor's, Anton etc.I do not recommend this book at all."
5,Beautiful!,"My favorite CD! I bought ""It Comes In Waves"" a few months ago. Martin's playful use of metaphor is fun! His lyrics are more mature than his earlier work (as is natural) and is a comfortable fit for me. The music is is wonderful, and is engaging in a way that is complex without being complicated. I enjoy the surprises! I would definitely recommend this CD to my friends (and have!)"
3,After all this time....this?,"I'm a huge Martin Briley fan (even when he was with Greenslade), having owned all of his LPs and then getting them on CD (even the rare ""One Night With A Stranger"") and then the box set. His catchy, unpredictable melodies, strong grooves and incredibly clever lyrics... so what happened on this CD? All of those elements seem to be missing! Could it be because he collaborated with other writers or did all of those years writing pop tunes for other artists leave him without depth and invention. The CD's not on my trade list but it surely wasn't worth the wait (and it was a long wait). The production quality is also poor and the drums programmed (Why?). Well, at least the cover is kind of cool and in keeping with his past covers."
4,Water,"Parker has an ability which I have rearely seen - in which he is able to inject incredible sensitivity into his characters. I feel like I am deeply into their heads and feel their thoughts, strengths desires, weaknesses and motives."
4,3rd Times A Charm for Merci Rayborn,"Merci Rayborn returns in Black Water for her third go aroung as Parker's lead detective. If you haven't read Blue Hour and Red Light, you might be a little confused, as this woman comes in with ALOT of baggage. While I didn't really care for her in Blue and I couldn't stand her in Red she actually grew on me in this final(?) book that features her. The plot is pretty good and it mirrors circumstances that she dealt with in Red Light so she doesn't want to make the same mistakes again. Overall the story worked for me, but it does get slow from time to time and I have to agree with the others about Tim, the kid, being a little too smart and really annoying but atleast she wasn't looking in the damn backseat every other sentence. I'm loooking foward to reading Cold Pursuit next."
1,Very Boring and Tedious,"Unlike ""Silent Joe"", which was a very enjoyable book, this novel takes forever to get to a not-hard-to-guess ending. The plot moves at a snails pace, and the author spends many paragraphs on things that have nothing to do with the storyline. The worst is the constant references to Merci's son, that seemed to be in the book for the sole purpose to make readers go ""Aaah, isn't that sweet"". If all the space taken up by showing how ""cute"" her son is was cut from the book, it would be about 1/3 shorter. The kid calling Archie ""Awchie"" all the time made me want to put the book down for good without finishing it. There is no suspense in this novel, and the lead characters are just not very involving. Get it from your library if you want to read this, but save your money."
1,A Very Weak Effort,"The last book by T. Jefferson Parker I read was his first: ""Laguna Heat,"" which I thought was terrific back in the '80s. Parker's latest offering, ""Black Water,"" is just plain boring. The story is uninteresting, the characterization is shallow, and there is no suspense whatsoever. I think this book (a meager 338 pages) was pieced together to meet a commitment to his publisher. I am an avid reader of this genre but will not be revisiting the T. Jefferson Parker shelf for a long time."
2,Disappointed In This One,"Orange County Sheriff Deputy Archie Wildcraft hears a disturbance in his home in the middle of the night. He investigates and is shot in the head. He survives, but his young wife is killed. This book had a promising beginning, but the plot was transparent and the pace dragged considerably at times. I did like the character, Archie, but the detective investigating the case, Merci Rayborn, was mostly just annoying. Frequent references to Merci's mysterious past were intriguing at first, then tedious. I am a big fan of T. Jefferson Parker's and can usually count on a good tale from him, but I felt let down by this one."
2,Weak effort,It may have been my mood but I found the book difficult to read and I had little or no interest in how it came out. Fortunately several of my favorite authors came out with books this week so I was able to put this one away - unfinished.
5,A Very Useful Book,"The Digital Designer is a quality publication , plus it covers enough ground to be useful in all of the classes we teach, so students going through the program will probably keep it and use it in several classes.Your text is written in a friendly, accessible tone, and is a relief from some of the stuffy ""Design is the Center of the Universe"" books out there. As an example stuffy books are anything by Stephen Heller, Phil Meggs, or Rob Carter.Their books are really good, of course, but frankly too focused on defining design as an official profession. Their books to me always seem like they are stiffly trying to define design as a formal, codified, yet creative event.You seem to have achieved that friendly informative tone with ease. Kudos to you on your well resolved text. Frankly, this book is more useful to our program than any Rob Carter book, because of its accessibility."
4,Excellent cable,"This cable is great for lightning-quick loading, or syncing, of your entire music library onto your iPod at rates up to 480 Mbps. I'm highly recommened it for your iPod"
4,Great music from an excellent film!,"First of all, if you haven't seen the movie, go see it. A delightful film from the creators of Wallace and Gromit, and the soundtrack leaves nothing lacking. The suspenseful and thrilling themes leave hints that bring to mind everything from Mission Impossible to The Great Escape. Also a great blend of different musical styles, whether ""classical"", or ""rock 'n roll"" (which I am personally not crazy about), there is something for everyone. Witty and creative, it provides a great listening experience, period. Get it."
4,Starts right out with the principals of the Whig party by Abraham Lincoln,"in 1832. Henry Fonda doesn't look like Lincoln but he's young & passable. On reflection this was the best of the three Lincoln movies I saw in succession. After establishing his politics & romance with Anne Rutledge, she dies with a minimum of grief. Most of the movie is then given over to a fable or possibly minor event in his life. There is a county fair commencing with much partying, celebration, drinking & politicking. There is a fight & two brothers are accused of murdering a well known man in the community. The young lawyer Lincoln stops the mob from lynching the men & then proceeds to defend them at trial. This is not so much about his life as it is about his qualities as a man of integrity, honesty & basic goodness. There is also quite a bit of humor thrown in. It may not be John Ford's greatest movie but it was one of the best movies made in that best year of all time for movies, 1939. Cue the Battle Hymn etc."
4,"Cute, if not great","The Bottom Line:Despite being the film that Sergei Eisenstein picked when asked ""what film do you wish you had made,"" Young Mr. Lincoln is clearly one of John Ford's lesser works, but that doesn't stop it from being an enjoyable story; if you don't ask for anything more than a capably made and pleasant story about Abe's early life then this film will do you just fine.3/4"
3,"Good condition. Lousy delivery time, it took over 12 days to recieve it!","The DVD was in good condition, packaging was good, but delivery was lousy! It took this seller more than 14 days to get this product to me and that is not fair considering what you get charged for delivery! For me, timeliness in delivery counts! Otherwise, I take my money elsewhere!Franck Strongbow"
2,old but good,"The seller sent me a note with the DVD that stated they never thought that could unload this ""turkey""...real class folks...case was broken. Wish I could remember who sold it to me and would never deal with them again."
1,Young Mr. Lincoln,I wish I would have known this DVD had Korean subtitles. I would not have bought it.
5,Great Film,An elegant film by John Ford. Henry Fonda does a great job as Lincoln (which was surprising). Just a great film overall.
5,Young Mr. Lincoln,"Based on the Oscar-nominated screenplay by Lamar Trotti, and unspooling with the simplicity of a frontier parable, ""Lincoln"" teamed Fonda with Ford for the first time, resulting in an extraordinary collaboration. Fonda, who originally declined the role because of his awed reverence for Lincoln's legacy, embodies Abe with plainspoken assurance and gutsy idealism. Weaver, as the future Mrs. Lincoln, and Alice Brady, as the mother of two sons presumed guilty of murder, round out a luminous studio cast. Don't miss this stunning, mythic portrait of American greatness personified, by the legendary director of ""Stagecoach."""
5,Grace is sufficient,"This book is the product of Tim's passion for the prodigal in all of us. He recognizes the redeeming work of Christ. His ability to communicate, especially in the pulpit, is incredible. He is humble and very real. The Holy Ground of Grace is a blessing. It is a must read for everyone."
1,dissappointed,"I used to do yoga quite regularly before having children and gaining 40 pounds (post pregnancy). I've been looking for a yoga dvd that is more accomodating for my larger body. This dvd did NOTHING for me. The eye rolls killed me - my eyes don't need to be toned, my tummy does! I wouldn't recommend this dvd to anyone. Yoga for the Rest of Us was at least a little more challenging."
1,doesn't kill earwigs,"The bottle advertises that this product kills earwigs, but when I sprayed it right on the earwigs, they just kept running: did not even dent them. This is false advertising."
2,Gave mine away after 1 year,"I was not happy with this stroller at all! As a first time mom I decided on this one for all of the wrong reasons! I thought it would be durable... Far from it. First, I thought I read in the product description that it has a reverse carriage feature. It did not. One of the snaps that holds the hood in place broke within the first 2 months. The cup holder broke within the first month. It is nearly impossible to steer with one hand. Could not push it in the snow... and it's a bumpy ride on any surface other than concrete. It's bulky and very heavy to lift in and out of my car. And right as my warranty ended the stroller became stuck in the open position, so I could no longer fold it to take it anywhere. Next time I will get an all terrain stroller or jogger."
2,Too sweet,"This is great if you *love* supersweet lip balms. I don't.I had been using Essence of Nature lip balm from Trader Joe's for almost 15 years. I loved it. Natural, and NOT mint. Unfortunately, they decided to carry another brand recently. More unfortunate for me, it's a very strong mint that burns my lips. So I had to look for another natural brand. Rachel Perry was the only one I found. It smelled great. It does work as a balm. But I CANNOT stand how sweet it is. It's not just sweet, you can't get it off your lips by just wiping them! Not cool if you're trying to eat Italian food. I don't recommend this brand unless you're a teenager, or love *supersweet* balms."
2,Motor noise made me return it,"I had to return this otherwise excellent camera because there was a loud motor noise at all times it was turned on. I'm not sure if this is fixable via firmware and/or if I had a buggy unit.It is probably part of the VR mechanism, but it was always on -- even when the shutter release button was not held down, and even when I turned off VR in the menus.The noise was fairly loud on any movies I recorded with the camera.I hope that Nikon is able to fix this with a firmware update, and I'll buy the camera again if this happens."
3,Coolpix P5000,Camera works well and is easy to use. After using a Canon PowerShot I find the P5000 a bit bulky. The image quality is not always consistent when I save my photos for email or web This was never a problem with the Powershot. Printed photos are terrific and the anti shake is great when using the camera in low light.
4,Exceptional travel camera...,"This looses a star because it lacks: RAW, 28mm(equiv) wide angle,diopter adjustment,full manual focus, more than 3.5:1 zoom. Not a perfect camera.BUT that said, it is VERY small and light (120gm less than G7,)withhigh resolution, image stabilization, a hot shoe, optical finder, and well made.It also works well with a variety of previous Nikon converter lenses, which makes it very flexible.I would buy it again."
5,Love this camera!,"We are a real estate company and use the Canon Rebel XT for our property filming. Last year one of our agents purchased this camera and when I saw the results I was astounded. I recently purchased it for my ""portable"" use and have found it to be perfection for taking great photos while on the run."
4,Too many features for what I wanted,"I returned this camera not because anything was wrong with it, but because it had too many features for what I wanted. The shutter lag was a bit slow, and I wanted a point-and-shoot that I could carry everywhere and whip out of my bag at a moment's notice. I was also a Canon and Olympus user before and had never had a Nikon. I chose to buy the Canon PowerShot SD1000 instead and am very happy now."
4,Almost Perfect!,"The cammera is almost the best.Pros: Great, great, quality of picturesLot of functions. Versatile. Has the options as a professional cammera, but in a compact size.Cons: Only two details: 1)It has an ugly silver-alluminium ring around the lens, in body front, that disfigure its nice presence. It's not clearly visible at the images of the camera that you can see at Internet.And 2) The rear display is upper than the rest of rear surface. So is very fragile and easy to scratch or broke"
5,Relationship Fixer Upper,This book was recommended by my marriage counselor. It has really helped me communicate better with my spouse. All couples should read it even if they are not married. This book will help couples understand what is needed to have and maintain long happy relationships.
4,"Billy Blazes, Firefighter","I bought this book for my 3 year old son and he loves it. He loves the whole Rescue Hero collection. The book is short, which is good for bed time, but he takes it in the car with him and looks at the pages also. It is good for young ones because the pages are hard. I would recommend this book for any child who is a fan of the Rescue Heroes."
4,"Not as good as ""The Last Viking"".","When I first read this book I was in love with it, I thought that Johanna Lindsey had mastered time travel and vikings. That opinion was changed as soon as I read ""The Last Viking"" by Sandra Hill. J.L. is one of my favorite authors, but Mrs.Hill WAY outdid her on this one."
2,boring,"i was quite disappointed with this book when i read the synopsis i thought the story was interesting but as i start reading the book i found it boring and uninteresting. the hero and the heroine don't have any spark between them and the time travelling is not intruging at all. [..]. for time travelling book i recomend jude deveraux ""the knight in shining armour"" which is so well written by the author. but don't get me wrong i 'm a very ardent fan of johana but this book is a disappoinment. i think her scope is more to futurestic and historical"
5,Awesome,"As always Johanna Lindsey has written a wonderful novel, I am a big fan and have always enjoyed her books.this is another i can had to my favorites that i will read again and again"
4,Time-Travel with a Viking,"I just loved the premise of this book. Not only does the Viking travel into modern day, he takes the heroine back with him! There are a several trips--and twists and turns, too--the ending, the best of all. The romance itself felt somewhat lacking. The story didn't go where I would have taken it, either, had I been the author. It was, however, what I felt it should be: a light, enjoyable, imaginative escapist tale."
5,A must read!,I recommend you read this book on a day when you have no other commitments...it is impossible to put down! I enjoyed every moment!
4,a good try,"i have read quite a number of time travel books and this one is perhaps the best. time travel novels usually contain many faults in the settings and characters or forced coincidences, but this book virtually doesn't leave a single detail unexplained, and the explanations certainly work well. besides lindsey has a great knowledge of history and the vivid story of William the Conqueror in the book won't disappoint you.nonetheless, i feel that the main characters seem to lack chemistry. perhaps the author should have devote more space for their romance rather than let the historical part overshadow it.still worth reading, though."
5,"A potentially cheesy topic, handled beautifully.","I admit that I am a HUGE fan of Johanna Lindsey, as well as a fan of Norse history. But I was nervous when starting this.I have seen far too many books and movies about modern people traveling to past times, and it is rarely handled well. The modern people are either complete morons (a la Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure), or they seem to fit in perfectly. This did neither. While the main character had studied enough about the time period to understand it well, she still reacted as any modern woman would.I also liked the ending, as it allowed you to believe whatever you want about the actions in the book."
3,Could've been better,"This one disappointed me, mainly because it had all the elements of a potentially great book: time travel, Viking hunks, etc. But Thorn and Roseleen had no chemistry, and why doesn't JL make her guys just a bit...meaner? At least in the beginning? Meeting William the Conqueror was cool, though."
2,"It SOUNDS good, doesn't it?","Don't let the description or reviews of this book fool you. I enjoy historical romances and some fluffy fiction every now and then and this book sounded like it would be engrossing and fun. I was wrong. This book is ridiculous - full of one dimensional characters, dumb one-liners and cliche bodice ripping. Good for a laugh, I guess, but I was very disappointed."
4,Lovely,This book perfectly captures what a time travel romance novel is supposed to do. The characters respond to the situation of traveling through time in a perfectly believeable manner. Great read and it never loses it's appeal.
1,Not fun at all,"I love Joanna Lindsey. I have all her books. I love time travel romances. The kind that sweep you back and make you feel like 'I wish that could happen to me'. Boy would I have fun showing off the things we can do now! This one was sooo boring. It was more like a history lesson, and not that much dialog between them and no chemistry what so ever. A 29 year old virgin?? Get real. And, when Rose went into the past, she started to talk like someone in the past instead of taking her personality with her. She was too worried about shocking Thorne with the modern day things like planes and such, and I kept thinking how funny it would be to shock him! My favorite books from Lindsey are the historical's or western themes. I don't care for the future stuff either. This one is not that great and no fun at all. But I will continue to buy ever book Lindsey publishes, because she is a great writer... everyone has a bad day... or book... :)"
2,Requires the ability to suspend disbelief,"Until Forever is the first time travel novel by Johanna Lindsey that I've read, and I found it disappointing to say the least. Roseleen and Thorn interact in much the same way as the characters in Jude Deveraux's A Knight In Shining Armour. The problem inherent in both these novels is that it's pretty hard to find a happy ending when the hero and heroine are living lives centuries apart. There's really no way for things to end well under those circumstances. Another problem is Thorn's chauvanistic attitude, though I can understand it somewhat as he is a Viking. It clashes incessantly with Roseleen's ""woman of the 90's"" persona, and I didn't for a second believe that she would put it aside--even for love. I was unable to suspend disbelief for long enough to enjoy this novel, but I'm glad that so many others were. Lindsey rarely disappoints me, but this is one of those times."
5,Until forever,Until forever what can i say only wow the way johanna lindesy pulls you in to a book is amazing
3,Not her best,"I usually like Johanna Lindsey, but this was not her best. Still a decent book. It had its funny moments"
1,i never got the product.,for some reason i never got this card they sent me a dumb dvd instead so there is nothing good i can say about this item.
3,nice but not well made,"I liked the looks of this lamp but after a couple of months it started to break at the seam where you screw the two poles together. It couldn't be fixed so I threw it out. Also, didn't realize it had a foot control for the light. I would have liked the traditional up near the top better for easier access."
2,NOT WHAT YOU THINK,"This lamp is really cute, but not practical. It is smaller than it looks, and the shade is very cheap plastic material. The most important thing is that the shade makes your whole room RED. Do not use this as the only light source in the room unless you like living in a fire like atmosphere! I returned it."
3,lamp,"The lines of this lamp are very nice, and the light emitted is subtle and soft. I had the same experience as the previous poster of it coming apart at the seems where it is screwed together. It eventually stayed put with some super glue but every time I moved it it fell apart before."
3,Shepherd Floor Lamp - Mica,"Very pretty, but MUCH shorter than I thought it would be...check out the diminsions before you buy!"
2,Arrived damaged,"Even though the lamp was packed really well, the shade was smashed in when I unwrapped it. My return and refund were processed quickly so that at least was good."
4,great lamp for the price,"First, it is more golden brownish, than reddish, like it might look in the photo. The quality is commensurate with the price. I think it looks great in my living room. Not plastic, like some people are saying. Set up was a snap, and I like how it hangs over the arm of my sofa, so that I can use it as a reading lamp, as planned. I use clear light bulbs in it so you can't see the bulb shape through the shade (that was a tip I stole from another reviewer, it works)."
2,"Misleading: Color is brown - not reddish, not sturdy",The color of the lamp does not look like the pictures at all. There is no reddish tint to it at all. It is brown. Also the lamp leans to the side when it is assembled so it is not very steady. It does not stand straight so I have to keep pushing it upright whenever it gets bumped even a little or moved. It's like it doesn't screw in right to the base.
3,Floor lamp,"The floor lamp is nice looking, though not as tall as I originally thought. I live in the UK and purchased the lamp thinking that like most lamps, the switch and socket would be rated for 250volts so I could use it here. As it turns out, the switch and socket are only rated for 120V. Useless to me unless I put a transformer in the circuit."
2,lamp,The lamps put out minimal light and look really flimsy. They are not as high-quality as they appeared on the website.
2,"Pleasing to the eye, but poorly made","I really loved the look of the lamp, and it went perfectly in my living room for a reading light next to my favorite chair. Two days after I bought it, it broke at the place where it screws together on the pole. I returned it, and actually considered getting another one just because I liked the looks of it so well, but ended up just getting a refund. I was pretty disappointed, and am still looking for a lamp to replace it."
4,Beautiful lamp except for floor switch,"I love this lamp. It's beautiful and well-made. A good value. But it seems to be designed for reading to hang over a seat so the floor switch isn't practical. I would like there to be a knob on the side near the top to turn it on and off instead. Besides that, it's great."
5,Very Pleased,"I purchased this floor lamp and I am completely satisfied with the quality and the amber look, it is exactly what I was looking for. The size is perfect, not too tall and the amber glow makes the room very inviting."
1,Worst French text,"I usually like British texts for French, but this one was forced on me for a course I taught internationally. It was full of nonsense nobody was ever going to use, it had lots of pictures of people who all looked like each other and about whom nobody cared; it underplayed the grammar, but then it was impossible to grasp onto anything. My students were all language teachers, so I was paricularly disgusted with this text as they learned practically nothing in 8 weeks. I also used it for a private student, who didn't learn anything from it either, so I can honestly say, don't buy it!I have been teaching French for over 40 years, by the way, and most of the new texts are terrible because they have so much stuffed into them that the student can't retain it and ultimately becomes confused. Faon de Parler made me homesick for the good old, logically laid out, minimal step texts that actually taught people how to speak he language."
2,It's not soup yet.,"I plowed through this novel because it reads pretty quick, but for me it didn't hang together well at all. Shirley scatters lot of references to other science fiction works through his book, which might contribute to my impression that the book is a pastiche of common SF plot devices and ideas.There are apocryphal religious ideas that are handled better in Philip K. Dick, historical conspiracy ideas that come off much better in the Illuminatus! trilogy, gratuitous graphic violence, and competing aliens that had me wondering if this is some kind of Scientology thing.The writing style has a pace and visual quality I associate with screenwriting, which is not bad, and I've read much worse dialog, but overall it was disappointing."
5,A Must Have!,"We never leave home without these. They are just the thing to have when dining out or away from home. They are easy to put on, stay put, have a catch all pocket and the best part is that you throw it away."
3,"Convenient, but...","Bibsters make a great addition to any diaper bag, but I do have one gripe: I can't use the Bibster to clean my baby's face/hands after a meal. The material on the underside of the Bibster is 'slick' and will not work as a pseudo-washcloth. If you're just looking for something to protect your child's clothes and don't want to pack bibs from home, this is a good product for you. The Pocket Bibsters do work well at catching crumbs and Cheerios!5 stars for convenience/portability3 stars overall"
5,love the convenience,"These things are great. They work just as well as cloth, are water (drool) proof, fit nicely around little necks, it goes on fairly securely."
4,Love these bibs!,"We use these bibs when we travel or go out to eat. They are very convenient and work great with the pocket to catch any food my 18 month old decides to spit out. The best part about these bibs is that they use velcro to attach rather than a sticker like attachment. We have used Munchkin disposable bibs and they have a sticker attachment that always gets caught in my daughters hair. I don't have that problem with the velcro attachments on this bib. We orginally picked these up at Walmart, but cannot find them there anymore, so I was glad to see them on Amazon."
3,tried but quit,We tried these but now we use a pocketed non-disposable bib instead. We prefer washing to spending.
4,Launder less :),Great product if you want to lessen your laundry loads.Velcro works with no problem.Maybe a little pricey :(
3,they work but daughter didn't like them,"I put this in the car in case I forget to bring my daughter's bib, which is half of the time we go out. I don't know why but she doesn't like to use it and always try to pull it off. She was too little and couldn't talk yet so I could only speculate that it is not soft enough as it is made of some sort of thick paper. I would have given it a 5 star if it weren't for my daughter not liking it. We only used a bout 5 and the box is squished from being in the trunk all the time. Unfortunately it is a waste of money for us. So perhaps you should buy a pack to make sure your kid will use it before buy a pack of 4."
4,Great idea to give with a baby gift,"I feel in love with these throw away bibs when my son was little. I put a box in with baby shower gifts and they were a hit! I was able to reuse the disposable bib the times that my son didn't drop anything on it, the bib will re-stick (that is helpful). The only thing negative I can say is that when the child is able to pull the bib it will come undone. There are three different sizes, my 2 yr old got to where the large size wouldn't fit around his neck. So for younger children these bibs are great."
4,Ready for more,"Once I started this book, I could not put it down. My Bigjim spins an exciting, interesting, fast-paced story that left me wanting to know ""what happens next."" I learned much about the native american culture. The book was an easy read but the story was complex - not an easy task. I plan to read Plants again and am anxiously awaiting the sequel. I enjoyed this book very much."
2,Cisco Works Instruction Manual,"This book is an informational instruction booklet on how to utilize the services available in any of the Cisco Works packages. It touches briefly on the concepts and terminology involved with Network Managment Solutions and may be insightful for beginning Cisco Works administrators. If you are a higher level NMS Engineer or have had prior experiences working with NMS protocols, this book will not help you move forward in your skills. I would only recommend this item for beginning users."
3,What can I say..its the only book on CW2K?,"As a person involved in CEMS, this book is the most awaited one for me, ordered it even before it was released. I have the experience using/installing CiscoWorks for 3 different OS AIX/Solaris/NT. As for me this book does help in certain areas (especially in preparing the customer documentations) but I expect more from the author especially in areas such as using and managing the CW2K itself rather than explaining the details on how to configure (which can be found from the Cisco websites or from the HELP file).Some tips are useful such as issues in CAM, problem with IE etc. Anyway its is the Volume 1 and the next volume (I hope) would provide more useful details than the first"
2,Only if you're actually working with CiscoWorks 2000...,"Probably someone using (or strating to use) CW2000 will get a lot from this book, but I've come to the conclusion that I'll gain nothing & have given up on trying to read this book. It goes into lots of detail on the many COMPLEX sub-functions of Cw2000. For CWSI (switches), you'll have to wait for Vol 2. Not an easy read (for an outsider), and addresses CW2000's RME almost exclusively."
3,No mac & cheese for me.,"I love mac & cheese. Used to be able to eat this all the time, but not anymore. It has good flavor & is easy to make. But every time I eat it I get nasty diarrhea (happens with anything that has powdered cheese), so I'm not able to eat this form of mac & cheese anymore. Fortunately, Kraft has come up with mac & cheese with liquid cheese sauce & I can & do eat this. I am glad there are many others out there whi can eat this. Wish I could."
2,ok,"Axle is great! Axle bearings that come with the axle are junk, fall apart, Had to buy bearings from Napa. Another $40.00. Felt great."
1,Doesn't Work,"I usually wax my own facial hair with hot wax. That said, I'm very practiced at pulling the wax strips off with a quick and steady hand.I recently bought these strips while on vacation. I figured that they would be easy to use, as long as I followed the directions to a ""T."" I washed my face first, used the pre-treatment towelette, and gently massaged the strips and lightly placed on the trouble area. Yanked the strip swiftly and cleanly... and it came off without any hair. A second attempt left half the strip on my face, and the plastic backing in my fingers. I tried one more time, and ended up getting wax on 3/4 of my eyebrows and 1/4 of them on the strip.Just a poor product, if you need more than a few strays tweezed. Better off with shaving, hot waxing, or tweezers."
4,good at price but bad overclock !!!,"Well, i always told myself. you have to buy a card that is better than it claims. This Card beat 90 c under load on a 43 C ambient temperature (Brazil) . The overclock room is weak. 350 to 375. 1000 to 1050. The are others vendors (Leadtek) that make better colling solutions, but is very fragile. So, it up to you."
2,Smokey Rides Again,"Someone asked what movies are included in this pack and I have uncovered the information that the following movies are included in this pack:Smokey and the Bandit (1977), MPAA Rating: PGSmokey and the Bandit II (1980), MPAA Rating: PGSmokey and the Bandit 3 (1983), MPAA Rating: PGBandit: Bandit Goes Country (1994)Bandit: Bandit's Silver Angel (1994)Bandit: Beauty and the Bandit (1994)Bandit: Bandit Bandit (1994)The bandit movies are horrible B-grade movies that really should not see the light of day. But these movies are included in this collection."
5,:D,"1 great movie 2 ok movies an 4, well kinda crappy movies. but with this their is no stupid double sided dvds that get screeched each dvd has 2 movies in it that you can select from the main menu ( smokey and the bandit part 3 is just the single movie, not like thats a problem) great buy if your a bandit fan!"
5,Good family movie.,This was a movie I had watched while I was at home and really enjoyed it so I purchased it for my family. My children love it.
3,Originals are the only ones worth buying,"Loved the original ""Smokey and the Bandit I, II, & III. The others (Bandit Goes Country, Bandit's Silver Angel, Beauty and the Bandit, and Bandit Bandit) aren't really worth watching. After the original three, they really should have stopped the series."
2,Finaly - but with a little Problem,"Finaly and as Dodge Stealth Fan and Driver, we get the Movies with Bandit as well. The Set os okay....but I am a little down because you have o have a old School DVD Player to watch it...never runs on a Laptop or PC...copy protected...Universal please we live in a digital time...whatever you guys do with this, you need to wake up"
5,Great DVD,"I was very pleased with this DVD. Mick Taylor sounds great and so does the band. The guitar playing is top-notch. I also enjoyed the bonus feature which includes a good amount of guitar playing by him. It is worth the money, so buy this and support real talent."
3,Alan,I was a bit dissapointed with this dvd good picture and sound but singing was a bit weak and did not add anything to the concert.
3,It's more Mayall-ish than Claptonesque.,"I haven't heard the last half yet. Three stars is still pretty good in my books. Nothin' is gonna blow the roof off here but it's pretty decent music, great for party music, it won't take the attention away from an interesting conversation."
2,"An ""unfocussed"" Natural History of Australia.","The natural history of Australia is described in a light and accessible style in this book by respected naturalist Tim Berra. He attempts in the early chapters to describe the geologic history of this now arid continent and later relate it to the animals and plants found in Australia. However, the book falls short by trying to do way too much in too short a space. The author resorts to a literary form of cherry picking and loses his systematic thread as he deals with the diversity of flora and fauna. An example is the chapter entitled ""Some Interesting Invertebrates"". The Great Barrier Reef is especially poorly dealt with as it is treated as a series of, mainly vertebrate, photo-ops and largely ignores the intricacies of the ecosystem.The appendices degenerate into a short overview of modern Australian culture and as such are out of place in what is supposedly a book on biology."
5,I like it,"In response to the person in Maryland who was curious what type of light bulb this lamp required, I used 40 watt (as the tag required) 120v light bulb, and it works well. I really like this lamp. The price is unbeatable, it's aesthetic, and it is very powerful for such a small looking lamp. I recommend it to anyone who wants the most out of lighting. One thing about this lamp is the neck isn't very long. However, it was still powerful enough to light my whole desk."
5,Great little lamp - order two,"I bought one and liked it so much I went back to my local store twice looking for a second lamp, to no avail. Enter Target.com. This is a great little lamp. Good light, very sturdy, nice looking, with a good switch, unlike a lot of cheap desk lamps. Definitely five stars."
5,Delany on the Brain,"Delany manages to weave together the genres of personal memoir and political essay in both ""Times Square Red"" and ""Times Square Blue,"" two pieces of writing that together offer a unique and compelling dialogue on the sexual culture of New York in the Times Square area before its gentrification.The material gets explicit about Delany's sexual encounters, so be prepared to read some graphically described scenes."
2,Not worth it,"This book promises to be a history and social commentary on Times Square's sleazy recent past. But in reality the book is told from a very narrow and restrictive point-of-view (. . . )There's nothing wrong with that except he practically ignores the fact that the West 42nd Street sex shops, peep shows, and massage parlors were also an attraction for heterosexual men. The reader will get painfully tired of reading endless descriptions of Delaney's sexual exploits among the XXX theater crowd. Additionally, the handfull of black and white photos of the empty storefronts of the ""Forty Deuce"" were taken after most of the shops had been driven out of business. Without good photos of the way 42nd Street used to be, the vibrant nature of the area is greatly diminished and Delaney's text doesn't make up for it. If you are looking for a social history of the old Times Square, something balanced and better illustrated, try Josh Alan Friedman's ""Tales of Times Square"" instead."
2,Strickly a Reference,"I love ORielly reference books, this follows the pattern of most of them, however I was not able to use it to pick up and learn Delphi, as I wanted to. This is not for the beginner, but I have a feeling it will be a useful reference later."
5,This is a cracker...,"Every delphi-developer should have this one. Take your time to just look it through. You will go 'hey, great! does that function exist??' one time after another. With this book, and a good API reference (like the Delphi3 tomes) you will tackle many 'not straight forward' problems. Besides that, the book also covers some very usefull compiler issues, OOP, RTTI, multithreading and the object model. I only wonder why it had to take 5 Delphi releases...."
2,Delphi Reference?,A few pages describing this and that and the rest of the book is object/property/method lists. Useful only if you did not install help or don't have internet access. The Dummies Guide is much better.
3,Different from the picture,"We were a little surprised with the height of the lamp (26"") and the lamp shade. The stem is nice enough but the lamp shade is not as red as it appears in the picture. For one, in person, it looks more like some kind of antique metal. When lit, the light bulb becomes orange (like a bug light). However, when placed on a lower table, there is nice, white light on the table with an orange glow on the wall. It worked well but at first I seriously considered sending it back."
1,This Lamp Stinks,"This is not a good accent light, it does not even light up the table that it sits on. If you like the look of brown light, then this is the lamp for you. If you like a nice glowing accent light, this lamp STINKS."
3,It's ok...,"I'm not particularly fond of my new lamp. The shade is as red as it seems in the picture but very small. The turn switch arrived kind of damaged, but can still be used. What I particularly don't like is that although I wanted a cozy glow, it hardly lights up anything around it, or even right under it. We have a 100 bulb on it and I've had to check it twice because it feels more like 40!"
5,Love it!,"I just bought one of these and put it on a side table in my living room. It has a very warm glow and is a perfect accent piece! If you're looking for a reading lamp, don't buy this. Even with a 60 watt bulb I think it will still be too dark for reading. But if you're looking for an elegant, warm lamp, this is great! For the price, you can't go wrong."
5,beautiful glow!!!!!,"I love this lamp. My sisters gave me 2 of these for my birthday. They are on the nightstands beside my bed. They have such a warm amber glow, because of the shade. If you're into warm and cozy this is a great lamp!"
4,Purposeful and Challenging,"A wonderful book to study and learn from. If you wish to improve your stick control, or challenge yourself in rudiment training, then get this book."
5,THE Classic Drum Book for All Types of Drummers,"This book reads as though it has hardly been changed from its original publication (I think in the 1930s); nonetheless it remains an invaluable tool for the drummer of any style and skill level. The exercises are isolated into short (four or eight measure) patterns so that each may be repeated to perfection. There are no ungainly ""etudes"", no corny written solos, and the exercises focus solely on control and sticking, not on style; therefore they may be applied to anything from orchestral percussion to jazz to rock.Furthermore, the introduction is a dryly wonderful piece of writing; pragmatic, no-nonsense, economical prose imparting essential advice on practice. This book makes an ideal ""workout"" (emphasizing that ""control"" is the gateway to strength, endurance, coordination, and all else that drummers crave). Practice Stick Control daily, and meditate on the craft of drumming."
5,Great tool for personal growth,This is a great book for a percussionist of any level. The exercises are simply conditioning for your brain and for your chops. Absolutely worth the money.
4,"""Buns of Steel""","The reason I chose the title, ""Buns of Steel"" is because this book is a workout book. There is not alot of theory or conceptual work here. This is a plain book filled with exercises. For me, a drum hobbyist, it helps to focus my practicing. I first heard about this book in an article by Ben Jacoby on the ""drumdojo"" website. He actually recommended it in a piece on congas.The new buyer should be aware that this is a venerable work. Its first copyright date is 1935, but the exercises are still relevant.So, get the book and do the practice, and we can change my title from ""Buns of Steel"" to ""Guns of Steel""."
4,"Great value for money, very practical book","This book is full of simple (and more difficult) exercises to start master your drum sticks. The accompanying text is very clear: practice each bar (4 measures) twenty times, then move on to the next. And you can redo a page in a slightly faster tempo (speed) each time. The first page has 24 bars, there are 42 pages! (I must admit that he last pages contain ""only"" 12 bars, but pretty challenging ones).The book starts with single beat combinations, then triplets, beat rolls, rolls and triplets, flam beats, 6/8, 3/8 and 2/4 combinations, and more.I've played the drums for over 30 years now, but have I missed out on technique!Reading the bars requires absolutely no note-reading skill. After all, the book is just for the two hands. So do realize, you won't learn how to play the drums with this book. But it will increase what you can do with your hands enormously."
3,Can you say Feathers?,"Feathers, feathers, feathers everywhere! It's well insulated but my significant other had to stop wearing it because there were down feathers coming out of the jacket all over."
4,flooring project,"I bought this laser to use for a large flooring job. I was most impressed with the battery life. While not designed for flooring only, it worked well. The vertical and horizontal lines were most visable on the walls and cieling (which did not help me) and will be useful in future projects. I was somewhat diapointed with the performance in brightly lit rooms. I would recommend this product."
3,Check it before you use it,"The unit I received had a drop of one inch over a distance of 40ft, which is well beyond the stated tolerance 1/8"" over 30ft. The roll was off a bit as well, so it got confusing to use. This is fine for hanging pictures and indoor work but for building a house or large deck, this one needs to be recalibrated before I can use it. I gave it 3 stars because if you can't trust it, it usually stays in the box."
5,Well within spec and easy to see,"I've owned other brands and always had to check the accuracy, returning those that were too far out of spec. This unit operates well within specified tolerances and the instruction sheet was very descriptive in how to test the unit. The downside is that it is not as easy to mount on various surfaces as others I've owned. A camera tripod works great if you happen to have brought one, but the magnetic bracket is not that easy to secure. Laser line itself is bright and well defined at even 30+ ft, though would not be bright enough for outdoor use in sunlit conditions. Compared to others it is fairly pricey, however I think it is a tool I'll be able to rely upon without much concern."
5,good laser,"buen laser para trabajos en drywall, economico y satisface todas las necesidades en las que se ocupa como laser de linea."
5,perfect!!!,"This Dewalt laser level works perfectly. I can use it with suspended ceiling grid and then when I need to frame a wall square or straight, I can screw it right to a stud or set it on the floor. It's accurate enough for most areas that I work in on residential jobs. Also great for laying out chairrail or crown and base. I also like the size. It can fit right in my toolbelt if I'm up on staging and need to take it down or up."
5,A must have for tradesmen,Awesome little timesaver!Very accurate and easy to use. The time this saves pays for itself over and over again!
4,It is what it says it is,"I am a licensed builder and I bought this for a renovation. It worked as expected, EXACTLY as expected. The level error was 3/8"" in 30 foot which is exactly what is stated in the specifications. The lasers are not that bright and will only do 10 to 12 foot outside but it is still worth the money for small inside jobs."
5,Excellent product,"Product was shipped very fast and packed securely, the level works as advertised, would recommend to others and the price was right."
1,Faint beam,This device is fine if your intention is to use it in a dark area or proximal/near to the surface which is being trued. Our firm purchased it for commercial use in remodeling McDonald's nationwide and immediately discovered that the beam is indiscernable in daylight at even 7'. We prefer the cross-hair contiguous beam configuration but it has very little value to us if the beam can not be read by field personnel without the aid of laser-enhancement glasses. Extremely disappointing.
2,"works good, could be better for the cost tho","laser is nearly impossible to see out side unless you use it before or after sunrise/set, even with the glasses this is not an exterior laser by any means imo.looks great indoors, perfect if you only do interior work otherwise woudl spend more for a proven exterior capable laser ."
1,Written in about sixty seconds flat,I don't know what I was thinking when I bought a history book written by a journalist but I certainly got what I deserved.
4,Follow your own road,"Often the smaller, nearly forgotten films reveal more about a period in time than the famous ones. This is such a film, featuring a fine performance by a young Michael Douglas, and an equally fine one by Joe Don Baker. Rather than opting for the stereotype of Intellectual versus Working Class, we see two men from very different backgrounds strike up an honest friendship, with insightful dialogue about living a meaningful life. Lee Purcell is equally good as the romantic interest who comes to embody a way of life that's both attractive & confining. While a film about & set during the 60s, the questions asked are timeless: how much of your own soul are you willing to compromise for the sake of what seems like happiness? What do you really want from life? This intelligent film is perfect viewing for anyone seeking an authentic existence, with a striking final image that will linger. Recommended!"
3,"Interesting, but not great","The last part of this film impressed me some years ago, and I finally saw it again a few days ago, with a friend. We agreed that it was interesting to see, although the story is a bit thin. Interesting to see Michael Douglas in 1970, and the ending is still impressive, but I think they would make it a much stronger film if they made it today."
5,Superb!,"This product was recommended by the tanning salon owner where I visit. I didn't tan that much but mainly went there for mere relaxation occasionally after a long day at work. I didn't think I'd use it. But after I did use it, I found that it leaves your skin feeling so silky, soft, and I couldn't even tell if it helped with a tan because I could not get over the silkiness! It is pure luxury!"
5,New Author on the Scene,The premise of this book is that a person's soul gets split in two and reincarnates into two different people who meet later in life. It is an exploration of what it means to love someone with all your heart and still have important relationships. Often we limit ourselves to one true love and don't think we need anyone else. Soul Searching asks us to look at those people who are important to us and not limit ourselves and shut our emotions away from those who are not our lover.
2,Could be better,"I was dissapointed in the quality of this microphone. The sound effects are very loud and ""crumbly"" and the microphone itself is a bit cheap. The microphone does not amplify the voice very loud either. Cute to look at though."
4,"Mi Estrella, another hit for ""La Voz""","Alot of pleasant surprises in this cd, The first being ""Senorita Tequila"" When I first heard it, I tought it was a Santana ripoff of ""Smooth""....but as you continue to listen to the cd, it literally grows on you. The acapella vocals at the end of the song let you hear just how good ""The Voice"" is. ""Vete con el, another love gone wrong song, is certain to be a hit. It has a certain Norman Brown Jazz feel as soon as it starts but once the band kicks in, it's another great Tejano hit. Some of the conjunto stuff is a little hard for my taste, but his usual Tejano jams are just that....JAMS! Get this CD...."
2,TWO sprouts and dirty leaves,"The photos are misleading. My plant has only TWO sprouts and a stump (stalk cut off at the bottom). All leaves are dirty, have sort of white film/sprinkle stains (cement, lime ?) that is hard to clean off. I would never buy this if I could see it before. I hope it will grow at least."
1,plant,I chose this rating because plant is not as shown. I would not recommend it. Related products do not resemble this
2,Not as shown,"The plant arrived with a brown spot on leaf, had two small stalks, and was smaller than advertised. I would not recommend."
1,Not as expected,A friend and I both bought this plant at the same time from the same place. The plant arrived in pretty bad shape. There was only two stems as opposed to four like the picture. I wanted to buy a plant not rehab one. My friend's plant arrived in a much healthier condition. I was really disappointed in the condition of the plant. Be cautious.
1,dead plants,"Bought 2 plants and both died within the first 2 weeks of receiving them. Plants looked ok when arrived, but when I potted them, they died. Had bought another at IKEA and it's doing great. Don't waste your money."
5,Magical Plant!,When it arrived in the huge shipping box I had no idea what to expect but after digging through the packaging I discovered the the plant was in very good shape. I am amazed at the habits of this plant. It is already growing beautifully after only one month in its new habitat. It is quite fascinating to observe and requires so little but offers great rewards.I love it-- it was worth every penny!
4,Beautiful!,"I love the plant! Easy to care for. That is until I put it in a clay pot 4 months later. Using miracle grow water control soil. Learn from my mistake, add gravel, and dirt to soil. After lots of research, I finally found out why my babies started drooping off the side. Hope I can save the little guys. No real directions came with the plants."
1,Dead in 2 weeks,Plant arrive in a protective box looking very healthy.The soil was very wet and within a few days the branches rotted away. I repotted what was left of the plant but it was too late. I have purchased from this company before with great results but will never purchase live plants from them again.
3,One of two ZZ Plants didn't survive....,Purchased two plants...one has already died??????? Not sure if it was a bad plant or something I didn't do right.
4,Nice Item,Overall this is a very nice item. I have been using it to make Mojitos and it works wonderfully. The only negative thing I have to say about it is the handle could be longer.
3,Could be better,"I bought this because I like the idea of using a nice rounded wood muddler instead of one of those metal and plastic ones to gently crush instead of mash abusively. I was dissappointed when I got it because the end were digned up a bit, which made me wonder if they send me a used one. I'm hoping that's not the case."
4,mozambique trip,"Very useful and necessary information. I recomend it if you are traveling to the north. I recommend it if you are traveling north.Please note that it is a guide only, as a base for your trip, but it is always best to know the local people and let them lead the way."
2,Not worth the cost,"This book starts well enough but is just not great. The lead characters are not believable. He falls in love with her without a single conversation. The way they treat each other was very annoying. Every time he called her ""woman"" I wanted to throw my Kindle against the wall. I was very disappointed in this book - especially for $9.99!"
5,"From Marsha McAllister, A New Devoted Fan!",I couldn't put this book down. I fell in love with all your characters. I truly felt like I was actually there with them as the story ran its course. I guess if I had to choose a favorite it would be Sister.You are a great writer!
5,TIGHTER-HOSE-N,"The Doc sez, I have to wear compression socks. These are the best.Durable, bullet proof, great price, and they do the trick. 1/3 the costof other brands."
5,Finally Vegetarian Cat Food,Finally we can feed the cats with vegetarian dry food that cats really like. I hope that soon this company will design CAN food in SMALL cans that will be more tasty to cats that the one they have now. Otherwise the nutritional value of the food is designed to keep your cat in a perfect health.
3,Arrived with broken pieces,"Although the item fits the description and usefulness, it arrives at my home with (pardon the pun) a broken bone. The joint piece where the forearm connects to the upper arm bone was broken and could not be held on by the metallic join. it is a smaller joining, which makes it difficult and annoying for a such a small repair. however I would say it is a great item, it serves its purpose and aside from that break, it is worth it if your using it for studying or basic teaching. I basic teaching because the precise structures are not entirely accurate. although it is well worth what we paid for it."
4,great gift,"bought this for my daughter who is a grad student studying anatomy. She loves the size - small enough for her apartment yet large enough to see all the bones. Excellent customer service from the seller. They kept me informed of shipping date and package arrived on time in good shape. I researched lots of different type products - this was the best size, and best price."
3,Not So Perfect,"All in all the book was decent, but it didn't really make me race through it. I did not figure out the ""perfect"" husband because there were too many likely candidates to choose from. The characters were developed fairly well, but the ""perfect"" husband could have used a bit more development or something to almost make me feel more sympathy for him."
3,pretty good..,"This is a very nice stroller. It maneuvers well, its compact enough, and is quite stylish. The major complaint I have is you cannot access the basket once your stroller is reclined. The stroller has to be reclined in order to support the infant seat, so if you have your seat in the stroller you cannot get to the basket. It is quite difficult if I am shopping to carry my bags and push the stroller. If I need to get something out of the diaper bag in the basket, I have to remove the seat, or squeeze my arm in between the basket and hope to pull out the right item. The next complaint is, it is quite heavy when loading into the trunk."
3,Get weaker as the history moves on.....,"I thought this book does an excellent job of relating Alaskan history prior to statehood. The impact of Russian America and World War II proves to be well written. After statehood, it seem like only thing that went on in Alaska were related to oil, native land claims and 1964 Earthquake. There were whole lot more that took place in this state during the last 45 years that the book covered. Unfortunately, the author seem to be enamoured with the big headlines subjects in the post statehood period.A thick book but its quite readable. For people living outside Alaska, this would be an excellent introduction to the Alaska's history. For the local folks like me, first half of the book remains interesting while the latter half appears to be rehashed of newspaper material. It may have been wise if the author stop at statehood and then wrote a second volume since he seem to have a decent flair for writing."
4,Readable history of Alaska,"Borneman presents an exceptional overview of the history of Alaska which isn't mired in the minutiae of detail that many historians feel necessary to disclose. Because of this, he keeps the pace pretty quick. There is an excellent bibliography in the back of the book for those interested in studying the subject in more detail, but Borneman presents a lot of history in these pages. I faulted the book on the maps, which are small and therefore not very detailed. Most readers might not find this too much of a problem, but I like to follow along the trail, so to speak, with the author."
4,Alaska: Saga of a Bold Land,"This book contains very detailed info. After traveling to Alaska and taking some 400 photos, this book has helped me put together a more detailed narrative to go along with the photos."
4,Tinkerbell full sized comforter.,my girls love them. Good quality and less expensive than even Walmart. finally some kids stuff in full size!!
4,My 5 Year Old Loves It!,"My 5 year old daughter loves her Tinkerbell comforter! It matches the sheets that I had purchased elsewhere. The colors are bright and the prints are sharp. While it it stiff or not as soft as I want my comforters to be, it serves the purpose and most kids do not care about the softness or thread count anyway. It also helps if you launder first and rinse with fabric softener. The colors did not run upon laundering.This is an all year-round comforter. For really cold weather, just add another blanket."
2,i dont know if this is a knockoff or not?,"when i first got this item, it looked nice, but did not feel to soft to the touch...a rough blanket. then my wife pointed out that the picture of tinker bell and the pattern on the blanket did not match the picture. sure enough they didnt match and looking further the color schemes where different from the picture in the ad and on the box? did i get a knock off? i dont know...i did not pay too much for the blanket, but i wonder if i would have been better off going to the local flee market and getting the knock off there instead"
2,Tinker bell Comforter,I wasn't really all that happy with this purchase. The picture shown was quite different then the comforter that came in the mail. I also was very disappointed that it didn't come with a bedskirt. I had a very difficult time trying to find a bedskirt to match it. The picture shown was really what I wanted. This was purchased for my granddaughter who loves Tinkerbell & her entire bedroom is decorated with Tinkerbell. I really think that you should make people aware of the fact that the picture shown is quite different than the product itself.
3,tinkerbell comforter,Product is ok. Needs a good wash and lots of fabric softener before using because it is very ruff material.
3,OK..,It's what you'd expect for a character bedding set. The comforter is not soft and the sheets aren't great either. The only good thing is that my daughter likes it because she wanted a Tinkerbell room! It's worth buying for that reason if no other.
1,What you see; Is not what you get.,The comforter was not the design and colors as shown on the on-line photo image. My daughter wants me to return it. Very disappointed that the image on-line was not the same as what we received.
5,A Classic for LBJ - A Triumph for Randy Quaid,"This was an incredible movie about the life history behind the man who became LBJ, the President. It is one of the best performances of Randy Quaid's career. He is LBJ. Patti LaPone did an incredible job of playing Lady Bird.You walk away understanding LBJ, the good and the bad of his rise to power, and the maturation of his character in a true attempt to make life better for the poor and the minorities.Had it not been for the Vietnam War, LBJ would have been considered one of our greatest Presidents. His domestic programs, the Civil Rights Act and more would have been done to help Americans. Instead, he had to spend most of his time doing damage control with the Vietnam War.Great movie! It should be widely available."
3,Nice IMAX. Not Enough Fish.,"Get the Blue Planet series if you are serious about wanting the full experience. You will see repetition between this and Blue Planet.Good for general interest. Some spectacular shots. Not enough fish. The Great Barrier Reef is especially disapointing if you wanted lots of underwater life although what's there is beautiful.Each DVD tries to tell a story when I'd rather concentrate on the wildlife. Consider this if you want a light treatment and have a big screen TV to watch it on.Specific species covered well: blue whale, great white shark. Hawaii pictures are beautiful."

4,Smaller than expected,"Although this pendant is detailed and adorable, it was smaller than I thought it would be. The 1 5/16 inch measurement includes the bail. The pendant itself (including the tiny loop which the bail attaches to) is just 1 inch tall."
5,Cat and mouse pendant,"Bought this for a friend. She loves cats, her own and all the neighbors! It is a nice everyday piece, it looks good and is not too big to be unable to wear often or all the time."
1,"Tiny, stains easily, not a good purchase","This dish rack is so small there is nowhere to place a single cup or glass. Nor are there any posts on which they might rest. This caused many wine glasses to break. However, it fit beautifully on a counter top where you don't want a rubbery dish drainer to stand out. After a month, the spilling dishes and the stains from the water, which lays in its bottom, made me toss it. I highly recommend the SimpleHuman dish racks, instead, with which I finally am at peace"
1,Very bad italian,"Such a disappointing representation of this chef's recipes. Seems she is saving many recipes so that she has plenty for volume 2, 3."
2,Disappointed,I am a male who loves to cook. I watch the TV show but the book was very dissapointing. I needed more pictures to help make sure I knew what the meal should look like. I purchased 3 books for friends and feel chipped
1,Where's the flavor?,"Gees, how can you people settle for such mediocre recipes? For anyone that knows how to cook, AT ALL, don't bother with this book. Very disappointing to say the least."
2,HARD TO READ,"I love Italian food and enjoy watching Giada so I bought this cookbook. I was disappointed. So many of the recipes were hard to read because there was so little contrast between the print and page color. I suppose it was intended to be young, fresh and pretty. But please! Light green print, white on a yellow page? I don't want to have to write out a recipe already in a book because I can't read the thing. I also found the recipes that I made somewhat bland and had to double the spices to get the flavor that I expected. Maybe everyday Italian food really are like that, but I was not impressed. The book ended up in a charity book sale."
5,Great book to learn how to be an Italian cook!,"This book has great recipes that are easy enough for those just starting to learn how to cook italian as well as great hints and tips for those who are perfecting their skills. It also features some recipes that take some finesse, so it offers something for everyone and lots of room to grow as a cook while you try these great recipes! Loved the turkey meatballs-- you have to try them!!"
3,Not quite what I expected,I love the Tv show and have enjoyed the simple italian food Giada prepares. I was really hoping the book would have something new above what has been on the show. I have to agree toooo many pictures of the author. I will be seeing her in person the end of March for a food demo and I hope she has some new ideas. Almost seemed like the book lacked substance. Maybe next time.
2,"Glam, flash, and a dazzling smile","I can see how this book would be right at the top of the list---Giada is a stunning woman and hey, what person wouldn't want some of that italian charm to rub off on them? In all seriousness though, I found this book to be lightweight on info and lacking in authentic italian dishes. Nutella sandwich? Come on, you don't need a recipe for that, much less shell out 30 bucks (I see that it's now marked down to 18) for recipes that simply don't deliver.For real italian cooking, I suggest Marcella Hazan, Lidia Bastianich, and Nancy Jenkins. Don't waste your time or money with this cookbook, unless you're in it solely for ogling the 50 photographs of Giada that grace the pages."
3,Its O.K,"I expectet more of this Book,but the recepies are quait alright the only realy stupid thing in this Book is 1 entire page of how to make a Nutella Bread, my 4 year old knows how to make him selfe a Nuttela bread so I didnt really know why that was in There."
4,Love Italian food.,Instructions are easy to follow and recipes are delicious. Would recommend to all cooks. What more can I say. Great!
5,Fabulous cookbook!,"I really like this cookbook, the recipes have a short intro, they are easy to follow and everything I've made from it has been delicious. There are also beautiful pictures and helpful tips. My family has its own Italian recipes that have been handed down form the old world, but it is great to try different variations and these recipes are delicious too. This book is a great addition to anyone's cookbook collection."
1,A waste of money,"This is nothing more than a vanity project:high on cleavage, low on food photography. The recipes are very average. Not bad, but certainly nothing to write a book about. There are so many better Italian cookbooks out there. Anything by Anna del Conte is brilliant."
1,Worthless - Average Recipes & No Pictures of the Food!,"The recpies in this book are very, very average - nothing you can't find in ANY other Italian cookbook. What is most objectionable is the cheesy photos of the Giada on nearly every page - and NO photos of the food. A waste of time and money for the serious cook."
3,Good Cookbook - but not everything I wanted,"I would have loved more pictures of the food and fewer of Giada, but the recipes are great and easy to follow."
5,Yum!,"Love this cookbook! The recipes are simple. I'm by no means an expert in the kitchen, but i have been able to make all the recipes I've tried so far without any problems. I love all the different sauce recipes. It's easy to adjust them to my moods or throw in whatever veggies i have on hand. It give a lot more diversity to my italian options, whereas before i stuck with spaghetti, fettuccine alfredo or lasagna. Would definitely recommend this to any fan of italian cooking."
5,One of the best,"I love this cookbook. I use it so often that the book started to fall apart, so I bought another one. The recipes are simple and delicious. Giada's recipe for Marinara sauce is so good - I make batches and put it up in canning jars in the freezer. When I need Marinara sauce for a recipe, I have it made. I have several Giada DeLaurentis cookbooks and the meals I prepare from her cookbooks get rave reviews. If you love Italian cuisine, you'll love Giada's Everyday Italian cookbook."
5,Italian made simple,I love this recipe book! Giada explains everything so simply. My kids loved the chicken piccata recipe.The recipes are delicious. It makes people think that I spent a lot of time in the kitchen to get such delicious tastes.
4,Giada's Everyday Italian,This book is easy to follow and the meals in it are delicious. Ingredients are easily found without having to find specialty stores.
3,Too bad there is no pictures,Great Recipes!! Good explanations and tips.I would just liked to have the pictures of the recipes instead of the cook! She's pretty but it's not very helpful to know of it will look like...
4,Simple*elegant*everyday recipes,"Love this cook book, simple everyday recipes an average cook can put together and expand their knowledge of cooking!!! Try the Pork Milanese!!! Oh my....so good!!!"
1,Hated this book,Love the show. Big fan of celebrity cook books. Not one recipe in here inspired me to try to cook it. Disappointed.
5,Great and easy recipes,"I love Giada. Her recipe's are classy, fun, and so delicious! I'm a very big fan and can't wait for her new cookbook on Family Recipes!!"
4,You can't eat enough Italian,This book had very easy to follow instructions. The results were tasty and disappeared fast. It was written as if Giada was recounting the recipes herself as if you were watching her on television.
1,Save the cheesecake for the oven,"Save your money, you've seen this before. Please recognize Giada De Laurentiis for what she is, a marginally trained chef, with pearly white teeth, a prominantly displayed cleavage and a very influential grandfather. Put it all together and you get the modern t.v. celebrity chef. Very low on cooking / restaurant skills but very high on camera presence. Now ""she"" has ""written"" a book of ""her"" favorite recipes. This book is right out of central casting, a collection of italian standards that any chef at the local Olive Garden could put together with the help of a good food editor. Save your money and watch the show for free. Buy your cook books from a real chef.Save the cheesecake for the oven"
5,As good as Roma,"This guide through Italian chefdom is as good as her TV show...what a great boon to the 'everyday' cook--sorry, chef--and as easy as you can make it. What a delightful presentation of delightful dishes. We are so glad that Giada's first book sets so high a standard of excellence."
4,Everyday Italian,"This is everything I could possibly want in a cookbook. It really is ""everyday"". The end product seems to miraculuously be more than the parts. Giada stays ""on message"" and truly delivers a simple, yet stunning collection of delicious recipes."
2,"Not happy with graphics, layout, typeface","I love Giada's show, and love cooking and eating Italian food, but was really really glad I checked this out at the library before buying. It's nearly impossible to read. Small fonts and white text on various pastel backgrounds combined with very shiny pages make it way too much trouble to try to cook from. According to the flyleaf, the design was by Jan Derevjanik. All I can say is that Jan probably has never cooked and likes going blind. My graphic design profs would have flunked him."
2,Nice Personal Photo Book of the Author...,"There are about 5 pictures of food in this book and about 90 pictures of Giada de Laurentiis. That's not what I call a worthwhile cookbook. There are sometimes 2 or 3 pictures of her PER PAGE. There are dozens (if not thousands) of better Italian cookbooks out there, buy one of them instead of this vanity project for Dino's Granddaughter."
2,Ho-hum,"If you bought this book for genuine Italian meals, you're going to be disappointed. The recipes are mediocre at best. Giada's recipes, I've noticed, lack flavor - and the book's recipes did nothing to alter that opinion. They are relatively simple, though, so it may be a welcome addition to the novice cook's library of cookbooks.It would've been nice to see pictures of the finished dishes, particularly for the beginner cooks - at least it would give them plating ideas. Instead of food pictures, you're subjected to countless pictures of Giada's trademark cleavage and grin."
5,Great book,"Author Giada DeLaurentiis keeps it simple with this book. Loaded with great recipes and easy to follow instructions, the author has produced a book that is very readable and enjoyable.I recommend."
3,Just....Ok,"I was on the fence about buying this book and since I got it, I wish I had bought something else. It's not that the recipes are bad or anything. They look great and simple to create. My disappointment comes from the lack of variety that I was hoping for. For only about 125 recipes there are soooo many dishes that call for panchetta and I think a whole chapter on pestos. I think one recipe for pesto with the variations following it would have sufficed. I don't plan on making many of the dishes because they all seem so similar to each other and I do see myself giving the book away after a few recipes."
3,"It's nice, but...","Okay, I do have a pet peeve that this book does not contain all of the recipes that are done on the show. If a book is meant to be a tie-in with a television program, it makes sense to include as much as possible.The book does have lush color photos and is beautifully designed, as is the television program, but I find that the content of the book is on the simplistic side. That is not to say that there aren't some really nice recipes, such as the Lemon Pasta, a favorite of mine, but I feel that overall the recipes in this book tend to be ones that I have seen in many other books.If you are looking for a book that offers BEGINNER'S basics on light Italian cooking, then this is for you. If you already have a couple of Italian cookbooks in your possession, then skip this one, you probably already have 90% of the recipes in this edition."
3,Disappointed in print quality and numer of photographs.,"I love this chef. I watch her program all the time and I pre-ordered the book from Amazon. I was very disappointed in some aspects of the book, although I love the recipes and have tried many. The color of the ink on some pages, coupled with the shiny paper, make it very difficult to read in certain light. There does not seem to be enough contrast, especially for the older reader. Also, there are way too many pictures of the author and not nearly enough pictures of the food. I realize she has a hollywood connection and is very beautiful, but most cooks are interested in how the food should look when the recipe is completed, not Giada holding utensils, etc. I would have liked to see more pictures of the finished product.Again, I love the recipes."
1,Very poorly illustrated,"Through this 255 pages cookbook you'll find 49 pictures of the author but only 28 of her dishes... This look more like a portfolio meant for a modeling agency than a cookbook ! There are also other pictures: 3 of lemons (!!) one of a stack of tuna cans (again I don't get it) and some more of various kitchen utensils. When I try a new recipe, most of the time I am interested in doing so because I look at a picture of what it is supposed to look like and it looks gooood. I can't do that with Giada De Laurentiis book. This is a book I probably won't ever use."
5,Absolutely Delicious and TRULY simple!!,"I happened upon Giada'sTV show one day and was taken by her style and ""joy of cooking""! I made one recipe that she demonstrated. Well, it was a BIG HIT in my household. I made it again in the same week for company. They raved! So I bought her cookbook and I have tried seven of the recipes-sofar. I hope to make EVERY ONE!(No lamb tho) I have never been one to look forward to cooking but I must say, this Italian style of Giada's has made it FUN TO COOK! Plus the compliments are non-stop. The book is well presented and logical and easy,easy,easy to follow. It would be an excellent gift for the beginning cook or to anyone who loves a beautifully illustrated cookbook for their collection."
3,Giada's portfolio,"I haven't missed an episode of Everyday Italian so I was looking forward to this 'cookbook'. It turns out that Giada has made it into her portfolio. There are 125 recipes, 51 pictures of Giada, and 30 pictures of the actual dishes. Although she's very attractive, I don't need 51 pictures of her in a book. I don't think I have 51 pictures of myself! All in all, the recipes are good but I would have preferred to have more coloured photographs of the dishes."
5,Don't Be Fooled,"I admit when I first watched Giada's show I thought, ""oh sure, just another skinny, perfect woman pretending to cook 'real' Italian."" Well, I was wrong. Giada's recipes are simply delicious. I made her Shrimp Fra Diavolo, which is one of my favorite dishes in a restaurant and it was delicious and easy. I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, and I love Italian food. Giada's recipes not only look good and taste good, they smell like the homemade Italian food I miss. What a great way to get a taste of home. Brava!"
3,Ok for simplicity....,"I love Giada and her show(s). However, for my own needs this didn't cut it. This book is good for people who perhaps aren't already comfortable with cooking basics, or... who do not already own any recipe books. I much prefer Mario Batali's Molto Italiano for innovative recipes and interesting combinations. While this book is decent, it's a bit bland if you are looking for Italian dinner ideas. In fact I find this almost TOO Americanized. NB: I prefer her other book, Giada's Family Recipes, which kicks things up a notch and uses less 'action shots"" as opposed to photos of food."
4,Good but missing something...,I am a fan of Giada De Laurentis. I religiously watch her show and have my try in cooking all her dishes. She is great...the foods are simple and a gauranteed crowd pleaser the reason why i give this book only four stars is because the book didn't contain all of her recipes that are featured in the show which kinda sucks cuz i'll have to go online for some of my favorite ones as well (like chicken tetrazani). but all in all it is definitely a pleasing book with mouth watering pictures and a definite way to make you spend more time in the kitchen...I will definitely be buying her seasons on DVD though.
2,regular,"almost no photos just from her in her kitchen, all the recipies are boring just letters,on t.v. is perfect but in book is not good.buy the CD is better."
3,glamour shots or food?,"I went to the bookstore to buy this book and ended up NOT buying it becuase I felt like I was looking at Giada's portfolio. Most people who are into food like to look at it, not the people making it. I bet more people would but it if there were more shot of the food. Sad to see the writers of this book couldn't depend on the food in it, rather than the pretty face."
4,"Haven't cooked from it yet, but we love the book!","A great read, I am sure is the creations we make from this novel will be delicious!!"
2,dirty book,"I ordered Everyday Italian from this seller and it was described as looking new. When I received the book, it had a stained and spotted cover with ripped edges. I would not recommend this seller. I had ordered this as a Christmas gift and had to change the cover slip from the copy I own to the one I just bought in order for it to be presentable as a gift."
2,"Like the book, lose the pics","While I enjoy some of the recipes and giada is lovely....I don't appreciate the numerous pics of her cleavage and low cut tops. With teenage sons in the house, I don't feel this immodest presentation very appropriate or what it has to do with cooking."
3,I was disappointed,"I TiVoed the show and transfered to tapes (about 9 tapes so far), and printed out every single recipe from the Food Network website (about 250 pages so far). I have been excitedly awaiting this cookbook for months now and just got it last week.Since Giada used to be a food stylist, and most other people's cookbooks contain beautiful pictures, I was expecting her book would have the same thing. Therefore, I was disappointed about how the book was organized and the lack of colorful pictures of the food.Overall, I gave this cookbook a 3 out of 5 stars. I like the simplicity of Giada's recipes, but the cookbook really is not what I expected at all. Next time I'll look at her books in person before buying them."
1,Very Disappointed,"I am very disappointed about this book, presentation of book is disappointing, there are so many pictures of Giada and not nearly enough of the food/recipes she is teaching/showing you how to cook. Even a picture of a recipe in final would be better than a picture of a plate of lemons. Living in Australia postage was not cheap, I wouldn't recommend this as a purchase if living O/S because of the price of postage."
5,Best Recipes!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I've been searching hi and low for a great italian cookbook that doestn't have 20 ingredients and I found it!! These recipes are absolutely delicious, easy to make, and they get rave reviews from family and friends!! A ""must have"".This was my favorite Christmas gift!!"
3,So many photos..... and most of Giada..... where is the food?,"When I buy a cookbook, I buy it for the recipes. I prefer cookbooks that picture what the dishes should look like. This cookbook has lots of photos, most of them of Giada. I watch and love the show, I know what Giada looks like, I don't need to see her over and over again in more than half of photos in this book. Another large percent of photos are of common items like lemons or silverware. I know what those things look like, too. This caused me enough irritation that, had I seen the book in a bookstore and quickly thumbed through it, I would NOT have bought it. That is not to say that there aren't good recipes in the book, because there are. I think the editor or whoever is out of touch with what people want out of a cookbook.... isn't it all about the food???"
5,My most favorite cookbook ever!,"This has been my most favorite cookbook that I have ever purchased. I love the layout and beauty of the book, the simplicity of the recipes that come out tasting just like an Italian mama's cooking. Giada is great! Can't wait for her next book!"
2,50 pictures of Giada in the book!!!!,Too many pictures of Giada and not enough pictures of the food.
4,"Nice Looking Girl, I Mean Cover",What more can you ask for? Good recipes that are easy to prepare from an Italian-American who knows good food and the American desire for quick and easy. Everything I've tried was restaurant quality. I will buy her next cookbook without hesitation.
2,Did I really want to see 50 pictures of Giada?,"I was looking forward to the release of this cookbook for so long. HUGE disapointment. This is a book of 125 simple and delicious recipes...that part is true. If only we were given more than the 28 photos of finished dishes instead of the 50 photos of Giada's face...often they are the same photo re-used. It is really tiring and most of all UNIMPORTANT to the book.If you glance at this book you will quickly realize..it's ""all about Giada"" and the food seems to be less important than that. It is SO SIMPLE! Why didn't I think of it! I will simply return the book, get my money back and print the recipes from the Food Network website!"
1,I dont get the fuss!,"I did one recipe (cannelloni) which tasted horrible and i went over and over again to check what i did wrong but nothingi followed it to bitsss.. it was too cheesy no one could eat it.. i did better cannelloni's from several other books.and one thing i dont get,, a Nutela sandwich? she considers that a recipe??! seriously!"
4,"The Food is the Book, right?","My wife and I haven't seen the show, but we were drawn to the book's promise of fast and easy Italian dishes. Though some of the recipes appear more involved than we expected, they all beckon us with their creamy sauces and intermingling vegetables. Giada, herself, is the other siren competing with the food for our attention. Most books I've known limit the author's photo to the cover flap, but Gaida appears several times a chapter. She is seldom pictured with the featured dish. It's just Gaida being her sensational self with a tiny peek of the kitchen. While she is a feast for the eyes, I would rather see the extra pages devoted to more pizza and pasta. By her next book, she should decide whether she really wants her lovely personality to serve her magnificent food or the other way around."
5,My Favorite Cookbook,"I received this cookbook as a Christmas present this past year. My son is very picky when it comes to food - he has excellent taste and likes everything home-made. Which is a challenge for a working mom. We've made several recipes from this book and liked them all. A few have become favorites that we make quite often. Not only do they taste great, but Giada provides short-cuts so you're not cooking a 2 hour dinner like some other Italian cookbooks. I highly recommend this book."
2,A Personal Photo Shot or a Cookbook,"While I enjoy the cooking Giada does, I'd have enjoyed the cookbook more if a good portion of the 50 plus snapshots of her would have been dedicated to the prepared recipes. One or two of the author, perhaps front and back covers holding a dish! with more of the food photos in the book,would have been a plus. In future books save the personal snapshots for friends and family and give the purchaser recipes and prepared food snapshots."
4,Fabulous and easy recipes!,"The only caution is to be careful not to eat too much, which isn't easy. Everything I've tried from this book has been easy to prepare and has been delicious, particularly the Chicken Spezzatino (I make it about once a week) and the Verdure al forno, which is to die for.I knocked a star off because there are not enough pictures of the recipes and too many pictures of Giada. While I think she's beautiful and I'd love to look like her, I think the focus really should have been on the food."
3,Is this a cookbook or what?,"As much as I love to watch Giada on Food Newwork, when I borrow this book from the library ( I try to borrow from the library before buying any book that I'm interested in), I was dissapointed. I'm sure the book has lots of great recipes, but when it comes to the photos in the book, there are about 48 photos of her(yes, I counted)!!!! I believe this is a cook book, shouldn't there be more photos of the dishes than the author? There are some pages where there are 3 inserts of her photos, why not a photo of the dish?"
2,Highly Disappointed,"I was really disappointed in this cookbook, since almost all the recipes were on the foodnetwork site...Also way and I mean way too many pictures of Giada. I really love her show but, I expected sooooooo much more...For example no soup recipes...My husband pointed out that she is wearing the same clothes in all fifty plus pictures of herself..Did she need to fill up space???Why not more pictures of the dishes???? Or why not more recipes????Maybe she will do better in the future..I sure hope so....Also, very expensive for what you actually get..."
3,Cook Italian with an American touch,"Those of us who watch Food Network are familiar with some of the top names in cooking, and Giada De Laurentiis comes up in the Top 10 list. Her presentation skills, youth appearance wearing a low-cut top attracts many viewers and her cooking techniques are simple and choice of the recipes on her show is marginal. Yet for those of us who are interested in Italian cooking with an American touch, we have to look for her recopies. Until now we had to depend on recipes published on the Food Network. In this long-awaited first book, she does the same as she does on her show - helps you put Italian dinner on the table for friends or just for the kids with a minimum effort and a maximum of flavor. The book reveals sevaral ways to make red sauce, Pesto and Polenta. The price of the book is too steep, and I would recommend this if you are familiar with her show and know what to expect from the book."
3,"Everyday Italian, A Little Too Simple","This cookbook is entitled Everyday Italian: 125 Simple and Delicious Recipes. I seriously hope the ""recipe"" for a Nutella Sandwich (Nutella, bread) does not count as one of the 125. I have owned this book for a while, and I have liked what I have cooked from it, but I never pull it off the shelf. I am not sure why this cookbook has not become a favorite, but if I had to guess, I would say the poor layout (it is hard to read white writing on a yellow page), lack of pictures of the food, and too many pictures of Giada. If I am looking to make an easy Italian meal, I turn to one of the easier recipes in the Italian cooking essential,Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking."
5,Easy and Delicious,Not being an experienced cook I am always worried about some cookbooks being a little over the top for me. Not this one. Giada makes the written recipies just as easy to understand as she does on her show. Intimidation factor is low and I enjoy the book.
4,Delicious Recipes,"Many delicious, authentic recipes. I give the product a four, however, because although the recipes are fairly simple, they can be time consuming and at times require ingredients that can be difficult to find. Not exactly ""everyday"" recipes, but delicious all the same."
1,Very disappointing...,"I love Italian food but I was so very disappointed when I bought this cookbook as these are **very** basic/bland recipes. If you don't know how to make a simple marinara sauce or buttered noodles, order the book - otherwise, save your money. If you want a good Italian/American cookbook, let me suggest ""The Italian American Cookbook"" by John Mariani and Galina Mariana. Even though there are NO photos, the recipes speak for themselves!!!!!! : )"
4,SIMPLY...THE BEST!,"As a author and culinary historian at www.CookingUpHistory.com I enjoyed this book because it proves what all excellent cooks know...great food doesn't need to be fancy or complicated! BRAVO!!It's no secret that Italian food is among the top-rated favorites for dining out, but now, De Laurentiis has taken the guess work out of preparing classic Italian dishes. Try the recipes...you may never dine out again for Italian dinners!"
1,Disappointed,I am a seasoned cook and when i buy a cookbook I don't expect to be the test kitchen. 2 out of the 3 recipes I've made have lacked something. The panne coota was terrible. I had 2 delicious recipes for it but thought Giada's would be great. It was tasteless and no one would eat it. An embarrassment! The smashed potatoes were also a disappointment. We did like the balsamic glazed chicken but i am hesitant to recommend or try another recipe.
4,Excellent introduction to packing,"A good starting discussion for packing problems, even though several issues are not covered (look at Erich's Packing Center for the next edition). Chapters cover Circle packings, sphere packings, the Hales proof, seed shapes, honeycombs, bubbles, atoms and crystals, fractal aggregates, The Giant's Causeway, buckyballs, higher dimensional packings, and various odds and ends. There are lots of illustrations and good discussions. I would have prefered for more to be packed into the book. Still, it's the best introductory book on packing I know of."
2,Roxie's Review,"When Mama Elephant put the family on a diet, their will power remains strong until Grammy sends a cake. With the jogging before breakfast and the jogging after school there isn't much time to think about food, the Elephant family is sure to lose weight, right? Wrong! Maybe Elephants are meant to be fat! The illustrations are very good. Each has terrific deatail and facial expression. A warning is due for this book however because of the focus on weight loss. I'm not so sure the book goes about the issue as sensitively as it should. The first words of the text are ""I'm Fat."" Although Mama stresses the Elephant family should ""get fit,"" not lose weight, the focus is still on being fat. Knowing the damage being called fat can cause, this book should be read in an educated manner if you choose to read it to your child. After reading it, try to have a short discussion of the healthy foods the Elephant family could eat instead of cake."
1,Worst Book EVER,"This is by far the worst book ever. I got it for a quarter and did not bother looking through it before I was about to read it to my three-year old. All I had to do, though, was look at the first line and realize that I would never read it to my child. The first line is the mother elephant telling her children that she is fat. Then they eat healthy foods and exercise, but they feel terrible. Yeah kids, eat vegetables, exercise, keep yourselves healthy, that will make you feel terrible. Then they give up their diet and eat cake. They feel better after that. What a great message! I cannot say enough TERRIBLE things about this book. I Freecycle, reuse, give away everything, but this book is going straight to the garbage. I wouldn't want any child to read this garbage."
1,Can't say anything good about this book,"Read this book to your children if you want to introduce the concept of being fat and needing to lose weight, but at the same time giving them the idea that healthy eating and exercise is horrible and boring. Not to mention that ultimately you don't need willpower, you can just give up on a goal at the slightest temptation, and it's fun and funny to sneak around and steal cake you don't have permission to eat. We got the book as a gift. We read it once to our 3 year old, and were unanimous that it had to go. We felt bad about donating it to the school fundraising bookstand. Hopefully the person who buys it gives it a read first."
4,Great Read,"I was studying Jill murphy for an English project - she is a very skilled writer and i remember the books myself from a young age - re reading it I couldn't help but smile, its a classic childrens tale one i would recomend to anyone, parent and big-kid alike."
5,A True Favorite for individuals in Law Enforcement,"Patrick Burke take the city in a way that none other author has. he shows it at its truest form through the eyes of an ex cop turned Freelance Video Journalist. The Raw sex, violence, and intrigue to be found in the Big city are entwined around a great mystery, one that can not be put down once began. The multiple use of Chicago land marks, makes it easy to identify and creates an immage anyone can see. it is a true favorite of anyone who is or isnt involved in Law enforcement."
5,Best new release of 2006,"The action is non-stop in Burkes new thriller. It's about time someone wrote a book about such a dangerous profession. Free lance video reporters (STRINGERS) are the backbone of our news industry these days.I like the way Burke delivers on such sensitive issues of the day like illigal immigrants, gays,and abortion with such startling uncensored action. His characters bare a remarkable resemblence to many of todays newsmakers. The story is not only clever ,but the suprise twist at the end caught me completely off guard... Can't wait for Burke's next release ""Slaughter of Innocence""."
4,Great Read,"""Stringer"" grabbed me from the start. Mr. Burke puts a new and welcome spin on the crime/fiction genre. Terry Randall struck me as a Clarisse Starling-type character turned photo-journalist. It makes for an interesting combination and a great read. Can't wait for the next installment in the Terry Randall series"
3,Competent Corporate Outline of Mobile Learning Opportunities,"David Metcalf offers a concise and easy-to-follow overview of the possibilities offered to individuals and corporations by mobile learning, or 'mLearning'. His review of mlearning training strategies in Sales, Services and Management areas adequately grounds his discussion in real life examples. At times these examples need to be linked more explicity to concepts of learning, and it is here that the text has an absence. A discussion of learning principles (either from a cognitive or epistemological standpoint) would add depth an rigor to his arguments. However, it must be acknowledged that the focus of this text is ""...to survey, from a corporate perspective, the landscape of how mLearning is being utilized and what lies ahead."" (154) In this respect, the text is generally successful. However, for more detailed and practical discussions of design principles, multimedia integration and mobile learning futures, perhaps look elsewhere."
5,Great album,"This is worth getting for the first and last songs.""Page Out Of History"" is a haunting reminder of the racism during the civil rights music. It'll make you think.""One Way Avenue"" is one of the most endearing songs of thankfulness I have ever heard. ""My heart knows this one measure / Self-protection at any cost / But if my soul were not your treasure / On some backroad, I'd be lost""Kenny Meeks is real music for real people. As trite as that is, I think it's probably the most fitting description I can give."
4,Surprised,"I did not know I had this CD, and I don't know where I got it. Listened to it several times and was very pleased. I'm not much of a country music fan, but this music was fresh and had a good honest sound. The quality of the vocal, music and arrangements were very good. In a word, the CD was very refreshing: I enjoyed it very much. I would like to hear other work he has done."
1,Battery does not fit all cameras listed,"Battery was purchased for a Panasonic Lumix FX35A. It does not come close to fitting. It is the correct shape and the contacts are in the correct place but, it is way too thick. It has been such a pain to return, I have decided to just consider it A LOSS AND MOVE ON.John"
1,How fast can you do pilates?,"I gave up on this DVD about 5 minutes in. It moves SO fast, if you have no prior knowledge of pilates you'll find yourself going ""What? How? What do I..?""I haven't tried pilates before and was really looking forward to this DVD, but with Hessell bolting through ""Breathe in 2-3-4, out 2-3-4, now bring your knees up to your abdomen, move your hands down, breathe out and do this, do that..."" at a million miles a minute I had to give it up."
4,A.M. Pilates review,A.M. portion of this DVD is a bit more challenging than P.M. but nice if one can only do no-impact exercise!
1,Oh spare me...this book is just plain awful...,"This book is a joke. From Omar Amanat to the entire list of clowns that day trade in this book, it is awful. Don't most of these guys work in the same office? So now what? Every day trading firm is going to get all their traders together and make an absolutely USELESS book? This book has no value to it whatsoever -- not even some trite 'ride your winners' phrases with some personal explanations. I would much rather recommend Strategies for the Online Day Trader by Gonzalez and Rhee which is an incredibly helpful book with REAL strategies. The only people making the JUMP here are the bozos that are quoted -- and they are jumping YOU for your money! Don't buy it, don't read it and don't waste your time on this one. I rate it -10 out of 5 stars. YECH!"
3,"Nice watch, bad quality control","This is one of the most unique watches around; there's nothing else like it.But while the styling is good, Seiko has some serious quality control issues with this model. There are many reports of misaligned numbers on the chapter ring, and my watch had a badly printed bezel and lost a screw from the face.Unfortunately, Seiko's customer service is also quite poor in the US and Canada. If you have a problem, you'll have to fight them tooth and nail to get your watch fixed."
4,Full of very useful info,"In the tradition of The Silver Marches this book does a excellent job of detailing the areas of east of the Sea of Fallen Stars. I personally like the The Silver Marches book a bit better. (But I am sure thats just my preferance for adventuring local.) There are, the now, traditional prestige classes, that are well done. Over all I would say it is worth the purchase if you plan on having your players travel that far east."
4,Excellent regional source book!,"""Unapproachable East"" is an excellent Source Book, full of yummy background info and flavour elements. The details and info on the various sub-regions presented are quite refined and are very interesting. The maps are perfectly made, while the Feats and Prestige Classes are of excellent quality and help you give the right tone and regional ""feel"" for your character.I remain disappointed at the artwork and will therefore limit my review to 4 stars.stef_bocklin"
3,Average,"Overall this book provides some useful information, however there are a few areas which needed expansion, one of the least developed, and the entire reason I had purchased the book in the first place was Muhulrond - there is about a paragraph on the entire place, despite the fact that it is supposed to be the largest and oldest constantly populated region in Faerun."
5,Just as the title says- It's Eternal,"I thought he was the best of the best but I never imagined he could get even better than he was. Luis Fonsi has once again captivated us with his magical voice, bringing out even more intense emotions with every song in this CD (I specially like ""Mi sueño""). If I could give it more stars I would. This is a must have!"
5,An incredible voice,This is another great CD from Luis Fonsi. He has an incredible voice and these songs are great!
4,A beautiful voice; a satisfying collection of songs,"Luis Fonsi's CD ""Eterno"" is a worthy addition to the growing body of Latin pop music. Luis seems to be eyeing a ""crossover"" success, a la Ricky Martin and Marc Anthony, with this CD. I say that because two of the songs on the CD appear in both Spanish and English versions (""Imaginame sin ti""/""Imagine me without you"" and ""Dejame o dame amor""/""Love me or let me go"").The first of the two bilingually-presented songs is a beautiful, slow-tempo love song, and the second song is a more energetic number. Both are great matches with Luis' strong, but sweet and romantic voice.The rest of the songs on the CD are a pretty solid group, although at times the songs, and Luis' performances, are a bit excessively melodramatic. But if you're a hopeless romantic, that style may be just the ticket for you. Overall, a worthwhile CD from a Latin star of great talent."
4,A Collection to Collect,"An astonishing top-to-bottom, stem-to-stern compendium of this singular (and singularly productive) poet. It challenges the reader to come to terms with the very wide aesthetic and emotional arc of Hughes' oeuvre. It is also a physical challenge to cart about and read with enjoyment. The prima facie scholarship of this edition, it is a clinic in poetics to keep you company for any future overseas flights endorsed by no less a modern poet than 'Famous' Seamus Heaney. There is no living American poet with as wide a palate or as uncompromising in its anti-suburban sensibility. Quite a handy tool for dealing with irredentist slatherers of Plath, too - you could seriously knock them cold with a drop of this tome."
2,Great Patterns; Wrong Sizes,"I thought the patterns were fun and was anxious to make many of them; however, the patterns sizes were no where near what I needed for my Chihuahua. Even so my Chihuahua is of the portly/chubby type, the sizes were still too big. I consider myself an intermediate knitter; yet in all honesty, having to re-guage a pattern, change the cast-on, the measurements, the inc's, dec's, etc etc etc is too much of a bother. Don't get me wrong, I always gauge my work and if I have to adjust a few sts here and there and/or change ndl sizes, I'm ok with that... I just don't want to reinvent the whole pattern."
3,Ehhhh,"I love aspen bedding, and try to stock up on it since i use it in two 55g and my 10g tanks. however, the bag was slashed when i received it making it a pain to store like i had intended."
5,A great book!,"C. Rubin in this book shows the complete developmental process of the Palestinian Authority from a revolutionary movement to the executive branch of the government of a building state.Touches upon crucial points such as the Palestinial Legislative Council,the early institutions of the territory,the PA's relations with it's citizens and especially with the fundamendalist groups etc. I think it's a great book that anyone who wishes to study about Palestine and it's late political developments should read.Of course it requires a background in the area but it is very easily read at the same time."
2,Not that Serene,Expected more. Not that calming or relaxing to listen to but not head-banger music either. If you have some cash to burn go ahead but don't say I didn't warn you.
2,no theraputic benefits,"This is pleasant New Age music. If it were advertised as just music, I'd give it maybe 3 stars. I have some other CDs that really are helpful in attaining a mood, or in a few cases even meditating. This is not one of them. Try Hemi-Sync Inner Journey, Relax: Reflections of Nature, or any of the early Suzanne Ciani CDs."
4,Feel-Good Music,"At only 17, I can't really compare Admiral Twin to 'the greats' of Rock or anything, but I'm still able to vouch that AT creates just plain out, feel good music. Their lyrics, strong melodies, just... everything. Having seen Admiral Twin many times live, even when they were the Melodramatic Wallflowers, with being a Hanson fan and all, I can honestly say, (probably more with bias, but still) this cd is definitely worth hearing at least once, but I promise you, once won't be enough ;] It's a cd that deserves to be played over and over. It's that great. Oh, and if the chance should ever arise to see Admiral Twin live (whether at the small local places in Tulsa, or on tour with other bands) DONT PASS UP THE OPPORTUNITY!.."
5,"Awesome & Heroic, not Mock Heroic","Admiral Twin has amazed me again. Since my first concert, under a different band name, 7 long years ago I have been a fan. This cd is once again amazing. The pop sound is like none other. They make the Tulsa band scene proud I am sure. Keep up the great work guys! And thanks for including some of my favorite older songs along with the new ones."
3,For beginners perhaps.,"Sir John Glubb is a no historian, but he wrote this book well. Again like said in my other reviews that such brief histories written on the life and time of Messenger of Allah (PBUH) are good only for the beginners. There are other author such as Watt and Armstrong who furnished such pieces. These are all for somebody who want to get some quick facts. Perhaps if you are to write a book report for college then sources such as these are sufficient. However, for the purpose of the serious research you need to look at more authentic sources that are from 900AD-1300AD. Sources such as those will should include Tabari, Ibn Ishaq, al-Bladhuri and Ibn Khaldun."
2,An orthodox view of the prophet Muhammad,This book is a rather orthodox and uninspiring work. Typical of western scholarship it has toed the line of the fundamentalist arm of modern Islam. Recent scholarship has failed to put forward a revisionist and invigorating analysis of the life of the prophet. Some scholars have already begun to unravel the myths that exist around Muhammad as scholars were able to do with Jesus over a hundred years ago.
1,Nothing like the description.,"I bought this video (along with the companion ""extreme cunnilingus) because my girlfriend and I both wanted to improve our technique. In stark contrast to the description, there is no instruction in technique whatsoever (nor are there any closeups to speak of.)All it is is suggestions for unusual locations in which to have sex (eg outdoors, underwater, in a special chair.)It is moderately explicit and might be useful for titillation, but actual porn is better for that purpose.Do not buy this video. You will be disappointed."
5,A terrific source of information. A must for history fans.,"Bruce Quarrie has done a fine piece of work, with this book. An objective look at the history of the Waffen SS. It shows the armed SS in all its shades. Good selection of photographs help showcase the short, but eventful, history of this group of fighting men, as it should be told. I would, also, reccommend his companion to this title. ""Hitler's Teutonic Knights"" focuses more on the armored divisions and is another wonderful description of the Waffen SS. Both are a must for WWII fans."
4,Sublime and Inventive to boot.,"""Beyond Heaven's River"" is a well-plotted novel, something that seems to be increasingly rare in the world of Science Fiction. Maybe it is because it is a sparsely printed, 250 page novel, instead of some 600 page, mini-script, sloppy ""epic"". For that reason alone it is weel worth reading; there can be good, short SF novels. Beyond that, Bear has constructed a wonderfully sublime, if a bit overly vague, universe, inhabited by unseen aliens and filled with motivated, imperial human beings. Within this context, a Japanese soldier, from the early 20th Century is an interesting point of view to follow through the bizarre, soul-searching, (dare I say?) epic."
1,annoying production issues,"There's something wrong with the text of this edition of the book. I think they dropped some lines in the production process. There are many places where one character speaks twice in a row, and the second is a response to some question or statement by another character, which was dropped. I also found a couple of sentences that just end in mid-sentence. It doesn't make the story too hard to follow, but it's definitely annoying. Not recommended (and I'm going to be very hesitant about buying other books published by ""ibooks"")."
2,Skips huge sections of plot indiscriminately,"This was a good story but it was not fully developed. There are many plots in this story that were just abandoned and that left me with a strange feeling of dissatisfaction with the novel overall. (Example, when the main characters explore a new region of space, and they find nothing but a piece of a toilet...and then nothing else happens in that entire multi-page part of the novel). The ending was ridiculous and similarly cut short. Perhaps this book suffers from terrible editing, or perhaps the paperback was just badly typeset which damaged the story, but there were many grammatical errors and whole missing paragraphs. I liked the premise of the story, but it was not developed and left me extremely dissatisfied, as if the climax has been edited out."
2,Dimensions would be nice,"Considering that this is advertised as a ""compact"" dish drainer, don't you think people might be interested in the dimensions?? Or would that be too much to ask?"
5,great,"My kids have the whole series of DVDs, and this one is one of our favorites. My daughter, age 3 1/2, especially loves singing the song when the family is making a birthday cake. I think that the topic of making a cake and preparing for the party is very inviting for kids. (I wish they had included the party for Fritzi, though!) My kids picked up LOTS of vocabulary from this CD."
1,cheap,Just remember you get what you pay for!! I dont think it even lasted my daughter a week. Just fell apart and didnt work ever again
1,Makes a good fly-swatter,"A tedious and rather biased rehash of Hans Jonas' ""The Gnostic Religion: The Message of an alien God and the beginnings of Christianity."" Although Jonas' view of Gnosticism is outdated, it contains much useful background information on the various Gnostic movements. Pheme Perkins has successfully drained away all the gold from Jonas and kept only the dross. Elaine Pagel's book, the Gnostic Gospels, is far more open-minded, far more original,and far better researched. Buy Pagels, not this!"
4,Yum yum yum...,"This is a nice little book of cookies, from a really great cookbook series. It is incredibly well illustrated, and the directions are very clear. The explanations are good, and there are around 90 recipes included. There are lots of color photographs for you to look at. It is a really nice book.Some of my favorite cookie recipes are in the this book. There are great recipes for Filigree Cookies, Oznei Haman, and Lime Cremes. There is also a good recipe for Lebkuchen Heart (a nice German Gingerbread cookie), as well as savory recipes.... such as cheese straws, and, get this, curry cookies!I bought this book for $12... and seeing it here at this price, I kick myself!! Buy this book..."
5,suprisingly interesting,"read this ethnography for a class, found it pretty interesting! Not as dry as most! I would reccomend this to anyone interested in writing an ethnography."
5,A nice story about family and friendship!,"It's always nice to read children's books that have a moral to them, or watch videos that teach something in addition to just having a nice story. That's why I was pleased to watch the video, ""Farkleberry Farm.""This video titled, ""Wet and Wooly,"" is the first episode in a new children's 3D computer-animated DVD/VHS series. This episode introduces many delightful characters who live on a farm. For example...there's PJ the pig, Doze the bulldozer (who also flies), and Mr. Wally the reservoir dam. In one scene, PJ and Doze promise to visit Mr. Wally again later the same day. But when don't return, Mr. Wally is left sad and feeling lonely. This episode teaches children the meaning of family, friendship, helping others, and keeping promises.MyParenTime.com recommends the children's video, ""Farkleberry Farm: Wet and Wooly"" -- it boasts a cast of colorful and humorous characters, who teach basic principles that even young children can understand."
3,Little bitty book,"Keep in mind this is a very tiny book, it's about 2x3"" but the verses are pretty good. Mentions famous places like Pike Market, etc. Makes a good stocking stuffer,"
2,Book Review,"The book is tiny with black and white illustrations. I had the impression the book was normal size when I ordered it. The book is too small to read to a large group of students.I would have sent it back, however the cost of shipping is about the same amount as the cost of the book itself.....disappointed customer"
1,"""Digitally Remastered?"" Of course not.","For this dvd, it plays out like every other bad dvd: the cover art is taken from other dvds because the company was too lazy to make their own (this dvd shoplifts cover art from alpha video's war of the monsters cover and retromedia's gamera vs. monster x cover), the 2 movies featured are shoved on to 1 dvd for guaranteed worse quality, and both films are in fullscreen. In fact, the video quality is so bad, that amazon labeled the dvd as black and white. This dvd was born a black child, and it's father was an 80s movie with only a trailer as an extra. Don't even think of buying this horrible attempt at making money."
4,Not for older Corollas,"Be aware that this cold air intake is not for Toyota Corollas produced before January 2002. That month they changed to a different filter box. If you have the older filter box, this kit will not fit. The new and old filter boxes have the mounting bolts in different positions, and the throttle body is different. I have provided pictures of the old and new filter boxes so you can see if it will work. Otherwise this is a high quality item, made in the USA. The cone filter has about 30% more surface area than the stock filter, and, according to K&N, the material filters better and yet has better air flow than disposable filters."
2,Rex Slip-on does not last,"I love Donald J Pliner and usually they make top quality products that last me for a long time. This is not one of those products. I usually wear these shoes for work so they get a lot of use but nothing extraordinary.The first pair I ordered, the sole started to separate from the shoe in the heel after 2-3 weeks. I returned and reordered a new pair.The second pair, the inner side of the shoe began to separate from the top of the sole in less than 2 weeks. I returned and reordered a new pair. I then had to reorder two more pairs -- for a total of four -- which all had the same problem.I am keeping my fourth pair even though it is separating like the last two pairs. Despite the serious flaws in its production, it's a great looking shoe. I really like Donald Pliner but this model is complete rubbish."
2,Sole detached from shoe,"I bought Donald Pliner shoes because they were supposed to be the finest quality. However, after wearing the shoes about twenty times, the sole totally separated from the body of the shoe. Not exactly a mark of craftsmanship on part of the manufacturer. I don't think I will buy again."
2,Not exactly as advertised,"I think the main problem I have with this product is that it was not as advertised. You can find several listings for this shoe, and they are not consistent in the description. The one I used failed to mention that the material on top of the shoe looks and feels like a very strange fake/rough suede. It has an odd appearance of being used even when new. I did not like it, which is why I gave it the two star ""I don't like it"" rating. Any picture of the Rex Slip-On that gives it the appearance of real leather is misleading."
1,Not worth buying!,"This version of Snow White is not worth viewing. The story's characters are ugly to look at, and the story is amateurily put together. Our grandsons soon lost interest watching this DVD."
5,A short history of a gutsy little country,This is an excellent history of a small Middle Eastern Kingdom still linkedin most people's memory to its remarkable King who reigned 47 years: King Hussein of Jordan. Hussein died in 1999 but his indomitable spirit lives on in his son Abdullah. Jordan still has a pivotal role in the Middle East Peace Process and this book describes how tiny little Jordan boxed above its weight in seeking to find peace in a conflict which has bedeviled the region so long. It is a book for the general reader and for the serious student of Middle Eastern politics. I really enjoyed it.
3,"Great for teaching, though not sturdy","The box contains 100 flashcards that cover the alphabet, colors, numbers and shapes. The cards are all double-sided, i.e. one side has a full-color picture of a certain concept and the other side has the corresponding alphabet letter, number, or sight word.According to the manufacturer's introduction, the set contains concepts and sight words that children will come across in pre-K, K, and 1st grade. I'm using them to teach my 3.5 year old and her response has been encouraging thus far. My only complaint is that the cards themselves are not very sturdy, and would not hold up to rough handling, especially by young children."
5,WOW!,"This music is fabulous! If you don't know how to belly dance before you hear the music, you can't help but get up and learn when you do hear the music. It is almost hypnotic the way the drums beat their rythm. I definitely recommend this CD to anyone who likes exotic music."
4,Drum'n'Dance!,I dance to just drums in the Society of Creative Anachronisms' revels and loved the variety on this album..
2,Noisy,"Why so much noise? I know very well arabic percussion and I don't like this album... Sayed Balaha recordings are much more subtile. Sayed Balaha plays with the true smoothness of egyptian tabla... check his recordings, they are good for dancing and listening...."
5,Dont hesitate.....This is not good But Great Music,I will bet you a thousand cows for this Music.Very very Good...A++++++++
1,Didn't like it,"I'm a bellydancer and I have tried using this CD ceveral times, but I doesn't work for me. I also think the tracks sound more or less the same"
5,"**SHAKE IT, BELLYDANCERS!**","The entire CD is an inspiration to me as a bellydancer. I can't help but want to dance when I hear the music and it gets the creative juices flowing for making up choreography! All tracks are fun, funky percussion - perfect for hip shaking and shimmying. A must for any serious bellydancer's music collection!!!"
2,Not Quite Good to Great,"A good book, but the methodology and scope pales in comparison to Collins' work."
2,"Too many ""duhs"" for me","Don't read many business non-fiction books. Find them to be too much common sense and move like snails. Well, this was true to form, for me. Felt like the author's points could have been driven home in about 50 pages total, but then, he wouldn't have a saleable product would he? The additional fluff is repetitive and intuitive and did not shed new light on much of anything to me. Try something like ""The Long Tail"" if you want some new thoughts on business, but then.... that book is not on the same topic.... but close enough for me."
5,Husband Loves this Figurine!,This is a beautiful Native American figurine. My husband's great-grandmother was full-blood Cherokee Indian and this gift meant a lot to him. He has placed it in his home office and the figurine is a very striking piece. It's just beautiful!
4,Happy Husband!,"Bought as a gift for my husband. He loved everything about this piece, and proudly displays it in his office."
2,arrived broken,"ligths are great but obviously fragile, one set arrived with a number of the lights broken, eg foot off, stand off. all light up.."
4,Full House,"I loved this series. It was really good and extremely funny. The whole thing was good, there was only a tiny part that didn't have subtitles and another part that was kind of scratchy but not too much. It seems like nothing compared to the rest of it. Definately worth watching and buying."
5,"Fantastic, Fun Full House","I laughed, I cried, but mostly, I laughed. This was my first venture into Korean drama (K-drama), and what a great way to escape the stress of each day! It had been ages since I laughed aloud that way during any show (from any country--and U.S. comedy wasn't as funny at the time). You'll feel wonderful while and after watching this show. It's hilarious and touching. And the actor and actress are more than easy on the eyes--they're intensely attractive! They have great on-screen chemistry. I also learned a bit about Korean culture, relationships, and communication. And there's a happy ending! I'll be watching this repeatedly, especially when I need a laugh. This is such a great DVD set, I even bought the music CD."
1,bad dvds,I purchased the DVDs Full House and DVD #2 and #3 were damaged and not working. I want replacement or I will never buy from amazon again.
3,full house - probably a good drama,"This may very well be a good drama; however, i found myself annoyed of the main female character. I just did not like her acting very much. She is always sighing and what not. I've heard the drama was really good but i can't seem to get past episode one, let alone the first 20-30 minutes of the disc because i could not stand the femal character. I guess this movie would be good if i watched the whole thing; but, i've had this drama for over 2 years and still have not gotten past the beginning. Therefore, i cannot fully give it a low rating-- as of now, 3 stars may still be too high."
3,"Excellent craftsmanship, poor design.","These are made very well, the handles are very comfy, the action is very smooth and they are finished very nicely.I was hoping of replacing my needle nose pliers, crimpers, and wire-strippers with these, but unfortunately it only replaced my needle-nose pliers. The wire-strippers on these are not very comfortable to use, and I'm not sure what the crimpers are supposed to crimp, but regular fork terminals or insulated terminals they can't crimp at all."
3,"Alas, there was not enough room to develop the story here","Meh. I have really liked the Orca Soundings books thus far, but this one didn't cut it for me. I think it was partly because I'd read so many similar stories before, and partly because the ending seemed really rushed and way too happy. It would have been more believable if there had been more detail -- but the Orca Soundings books are supposed to be really short. The other characters at the residential treatment center were definitely believable though, as was Kelly herself."
5,Goodbye Fluffy Christianity!,I'm doing this study with a group of college girls and we are being impacted by the many scriptures that teach what Christianity is really all about.
1,Ends up costing you more than OEM,"You don't really save any money with these as opposed to buying new OEM ink. 1) Most right out of the package require print head cleaning to correct streaking and that wastes ink for ALL colors. 2) Because of #1 you end up having to replace ALL inks more often. 3) Too many are not recognized by the printer and cannot be initialized.You're better off searching around for the lowest priced OEM Epson ink as it will save you time and hassle.Finally, consider shipping costs as you can end up paying more for these refill companies who charge per unit rather than others who charge for actual weight."
4,"Meditate or just relax to fine, soothing sounds","This is a wonderful cd from David Lyndon Huff's series that includes ""Serenity"", ""Meditation"", ""Massage"", ""Tranquility"" and ""Healing."" While I prefer, out of this entire series, the ""Serenity"" cd, ""Meditation"" is interesting and relaxing, with piano and synthesized music. This is not GREAT music or music you can hum, but for a relaxed office, bedroom, doctor's practice or yoga class, it is just the thing. You can put this attractively-packaged CD (it has a slipcover) in a basket with nice goodies for a stressed friend or loved one. I find music before bed such as this, with headphones makes me drift off peacefully and pleasantly. This is a natural, healthy aid to relaxation, one I recommend you try if you want to explore ways to relieve stress."
5,Deep and thought-provoking,"Solomon's books have obvious strengths--the depth of his research and his analysis of the music. What seems to divide readers is his use of psychoanalysis. I'm on his side, as his book created a thought-provoking examination of a great figure whose art was a tonic for the fraught relationship he had with his father. But Solomon also shows us that Mozart was neither an idiot savant nor a psychological mess--in his relationship with his wife and his ability to manage a successful career he was remarkably normal. Rather than the center of the book, the psychoanalysis is a useful contextual tool. This really is the best single book on Mozart."
5,BIOGRAPHY BOOK!,"This Book is a very good book! I checked out lots of books of the library and this book is a VERY GOOD MOZART BOOK! I personally will buy this when I can.. I have it in my Wishlist. (I don't have enough money to buy it now).. So I rate this book ***** (5) Stars! IF YOU WANT YOU CAN BUY IT FOR ME, IT IS NO PROBLEM."
5,Hard-Core Mozart,"Here is a book that takes a hard, scrutinizing look at the life of Mozart as viewed from the perspective of his complex and often frightening relationship with his domineering father. It strips away the traditional mask of Leopold Mozart as the self-sacrificing, all-caring patriarch and shows him for the controlling, smothering neurotic that he probably was. Even by 18th century standards, this man tried to hold back the clock and keep his son a perpetual child, even to the point of almost ruining his life.That much being said, of course, such a book is part fact, part speculation--but it was well documented; and even when it occasionally wanders into the realm of psycho-babble, it is a gripping book that made this reader, for one, shed tears of outrage. Excellent."
2,"""An Accountant's Dream"" or ""Mozart on the Couch""","I read up to chapter twenty (about 300 pages) and stopped reading the book, realizing I had more important things to read. My major complaints are (1) that there is too much discussion of the Mozart family finances, which I'm sure would be fascinating to economists and accountants, however tedious to someone concerned about music; and (2) too much retroactive Freudian analysis of the subject, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Think about this: Solomon uses an obsolete, and now debunked, system of psychoanalysis to describe a subject that cannot be interviewed. The best discussion of music is concerning the Salzburg serenade style in chapter eight. Other than that brief section (pp. 125-133), I was not impressed. Short of reading Mozart's letters and making your own analysis, I recommend Stanley Sadie's ""Mozart: The Early Years, 1756-1781"" for starters."
5,Excellent,This is a wonderful biography of the great musician. It really dispelles all the false truths and paints Mozart as a living breathing person. There is quite a bit of phycho anaylses some of it was a bit boring but I really enjoyed the anaylises of his relationship with his father. It is a little heavy at times but most of the time reads like a good novel. Wonderful.
3,Just basic tea kettle,"We purchased this and had no problem with design, looks, etc. It whistled fine, but the problem turned out to be a leak along the seam. We did not discover this til after a week when we noticed the sound of the water hitting the burner, and then I tried special epoxy to seal the seams and that just made a mess. Sooooo, I would suggest you try this out right away to check for leaks. Since the first one was a mess and we couldn't find anything like this locally, we ordered another one. This works fine, no leaks, whistles fine and we whistled happily ever after."
3,Sort of whistling tea kettle,"I bought the tea kettle to replace an old one. The new one is not as sturdy and really doesn't whistle. The closed top does not close as tightly as it should. You hear sort of a whistle and see a lot of steam coming from the top. It serves its purpose of boiling water for tea, so I kept it."
2,What whistle?,"While this kettle certainly is capable of boiling water, it feels very flimsy, it doesn't allow you to easily see how full it is (just the spout to fill and empty it) and the whistle barely works."
2,Cheaply made,- Hard to add water- Made with cheap material- Does not whistle loudly when the water is boiling.I will try to return to Amazon.
1,Poorly Made,"Hard to fill.Kettle rocks when water is heating.Cheap materials, you get what you pay for.[...]"
1,Poor lever placement steam cooks fingers when pouring,"No frills tea kettle does what it should until you try to pour the water out. The design of the lid handle means as you are pouring the water, the steam coming out of the hole goes right over the fingers that are holding the lid open. At some point in the design phase you really would have thought someone would have noticed their red scolded fingers and said ""Maybe we should move the handle"". Buy something else. There are a lot of no frills tea kettles that cost about the same without the lesson in steam vs flesh."
1,potential health hazard,"don't buy this kettle. it's aluminum construction makes it a potential health hazard. according to many sources, (all of which are easy to find with google), it is not safe to heat or cook with aluminum. wish I had known this before buying this item."
2,Messy...!,"I agree, this kettle has a very weird spout design. Hard to fill and dangerous to pour boiling water from. It ALWAYS spills. No matter how hard you try not to. Would not suggest this product to any one, in fear that they might burn themselves.I need to correct my review. If you rest the spout of the kettle on the side of your cup, it will not spill."
2,Not useful on flat topped electric stoves,"Looks good, nice size but raised bottom so that it doesn't make contact with stovetop, causing it to come to a boil much more slowly."
4,We loved it!,"My 4 year old daughter and I found this book at the library and we loved it. Its clever and funny and it rhymes which is something that we both love. It may be a little long and complicated for children younger than 4, but my daughter and I read it every night before bed and it never gets old."
4,great dvd,"if you are bto/guess who fan, this dvd is for you. nice music brings back a lot of memory. a must have dvd."
3,A meaty political review of the Vietnam conflict.,"Full of primary source materical, Vietnam in America provides an amazing amount of information on the events leading up to and the involvement of the United States in the Vietnam War. Whether its abstracts from Ho Chi Minh or CIA incursion force leaders, this book contains a great deal of data not to be found in other like works. A tough reader, this book is not suggested for casual reading and should be used for the diehard history buff or for research material."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"With the exception of ""I Love How You Love Me"" and ""Be My Boy"" I found the other tracks very forgettable. Even Lennon/McCartney's classic ""Yesterday"" sounds like last minute LP filler. I'm sure there much be many more original Paris Sister tracks in the vaults that would make for a much better ""Best of"" tribute. Bottom line is that I can't help feeling shortchanged even after paying only 5 bucks."
1,Poor Quality,This item was used on my Minolta Z3. The lens gave blue zones around the light/dark areas making the images unuseable.
2,"Elegant feel, poor stitchwork","Bought these a few days ago, returned them today. While the quality of the fabric is still a fairly good value at this pricepoint, in store Macy's has them on sale. However, the stitchwork has come down from a few years back when I bought this exact same set. The pillowcases in particular look like they are literally coming apart at the seams, right out of the box."
5,Tito Puente Last Album,"This Album is truly a Masterpiece,A collaboration well worth. Such Legends that span the realm of Latin Music. Good Job."
2,Cheaply made,"I bought this sprayer to stain my patio and it worked wonderfully. However, about a year later I wanted to stain a fence. When I loaded it up with a cleaner and pumped it up nothing came out. I took the uniit apart and cleaned it to make sure nothing was clogged- still it wouldn't work. Upon close inspection I realized that the handle wasn't working. When I would squeeze the handle, instead of pulling up the plunger and releasing the spray, the plastic handle would bend over at the fulcrum without pulling the plunger open.If you plan on using this product only once, it's great. However, if you would like to use it over time, then don't buy this brand. All of their sprayers tend to use the same defective handle."
5,Great product,"Don't waste money on expensive electric sprayers. This one works great! Covered our whole fence, only took about 1hr 30mins to do the entire thing!"
1,Disappointed,"I bought this to spray my deck with water seal, just what it was advertised for. It immediatly clogged. Waste of money!"
2,Should have listened to reviews,The reviews weren't too kind for this product. I bought it anyway. The trigger handle is junk (plastic) and just barely survived one project.
1,dont wast ur time,here i thought it cam with the saeler and cleaner and it just the cantaner dont wast ur time
4,I'm sure outdated by now.,"Not a bad book. Not terribly expensive. I prefer the workbook by Richard Polin though.NOt bad. I do miss the NICU. Really i do...Get this book if you want to do well in the NICU and actually understand whats going on and not just take care of the fetoids. Good respiratory and cardiac chapters.Between this and the Polin book, go with Polin. The NICU secrets book is excellent as well."
3,NOT QUITE WHAT I WAS EXPECTING.......,"this is a large,well-written book by people who obviously love the material and know the material.i had purchased it,never having had read the magazine which this book is a compilation of(i believe the first 10 issues?).my interests are of the horror film genre and sub-genres,which this book includes.however,i was a bit disappointed in the amount of material pertaining to ""adult"" films.having no real interest in that area(particularly on an intellectual level),i found a large portion of this book dull.so,for those familiar with the source material will find this of no surprise.to those who are new to ""Flesh and Blood"",be warned of what ""flesh"" they are refering too"
3,Darwin,If you like science and the little details that go with it-you will really enjoy this book. It reads easily yet contains much detail.
2,an unpleasant sojourn in a great mind,"I've been reading a lot of 18th and 19 century first person narratives in the past couple years and I thought I'd give this one a whirl, even though I'm definitely not a science fan.I wasn't surprised that it was a slow, dense chore, but I was a little surprised at how much Darwin was an arrogant, pontificating prig.Unless you're a science fan I would not recommend this."
5,Soft and Smooth... cuticles!,"This is a really nice lip balm, not too heavy, doesn't taste funny, etc. But, as far as just lipbalms go however, it's nothing spectacluar, especially since it doesn't contain sunscreen. However, it does have a very unique saving grace. I have found that it does a wonderful job double tasking as a cuticle moisturizer! It's tidy, and so quick, (I just swipe in on underneath my nails and am good to go), and best of all a tube is much less expensive than actual cuticle treatments! Maybe it's the added benefit of Aloe, but my ragged, dry, sad looking cuticles have quickly, (about a week), healed up and have been behaving!"
1,Sleeping Beauty,Since I am new to this I didn't realize there were different versions of Sleeping Beauty so I was disappointed when I received it and it wasn't the Disney version. I bought it for my granddaughter and the only good thing is that it is short (about 30 minutes). I would not recommend it.
3,Good but watch buttons,"Nice case, a bit of a pain to get on and off as expected, i do hope everyone relizes that they charge only .01 for the case cause it is all in the shipping and is about 5 bucks, plus that way you cant return it.Good case, but it makes the buttons on the side very hard to press."
4,"Great book to read, especially on a rainy day!","I picked this book up and before I knew it I was almost halfway through it. I was caught up in the story and wanted to find out what happened next. I have the bad habit of reading ahead to see what happens, but I didn't this time and was very glad I didn't. What a great surprise ending!"
4,Rocket man,I like this movie very much. I'm a big comedy freak. This is the best movie I've seen yet.
5,Great first release from another Canadian chantreuse!,"For a first time big-label release,this album has the freshness of an Indie release."
4,Christian Coaching Exemplified,"I really thought this book gave a great layman's format for Christian Coaching. Coaching could apply anywhere, Christian or non-Christian; and relates the basic principles behind coaching where anyone could read it and understand the concepts. It was a great training tool."
4,Mac still making it happen!,"Rise and Shine is a very solid disc by former Faces member and Rolling Stones sideman Ian McLagan. If you enjoy genuine performances and honest songwriting that still has a heavy dose of the Faces in the mix then get this disc. A solid effort, which you should follow up with Extra Live, which showcases Mac's strong performance in a live setting. While his music is more somber/sober than it was 30 years ago, Ian McLagan is still a voice worth hearing."
3,Where is the web site?,"I found the book to be pretty good, but it keeps making reference to ""the web site"", since it did not come with a CD. The web site mentioned in the appendix DID NOT EXIST. I have found a site with a similar name, but it does not mention this book, or any code examples, anywhere."
3,"Good book, but still leaves questions","I bought this book to be able to handle an upcoming project, and immediately began reading it. The first 14 chapters or so were extremely easy to understand. When it came to the databases, that's where I began to develop questions. The database coverage is less than I had hoped for, since that's the reason I bought the book. The examples didn't work as they were supposed to. But with some ingenuity I believe that they can be made to work.Overall, if you're thinking about this book primarily for database work the Visual Interdev, SKIP IT. However if you want a book that will give you general starter-up experience, GO FOR IT."
2,Angry. Just angry.,"I bought this book, and as one of the other reviewers said, the web page mentioned at the back of the book does not exist. Normally this wouldn't bother me, but considering the fact that you need a page referenced in the book (search.htm) and if this page does not exists on my computer, then how am I supposed to get it and move along. First chapter too. I'm greatly dissappointed. I event went to the author's web page and even he doesn't make any reference to the book. Now, you gotta figure that if he won't own up to it, then there's gotta be something wrong. I am very very disappointed."
5,Medline Remedy Olivamine,"This product works very well on sensitive skin, it cleared a rash that we hadnt found anything else that would doanything other than make it worse."
3,its good for what it serves,"now this book goes in the round about documents and the process and its more geared toward a college type of course than the actual experience of dealing with everything needed to be fully comprehend the overall process and what have you, it serves its purpose."
5,Pasta,This pasta was packaged very well and none of the packages were torn and the noodles were not broken so I would suggest people order this product the next time they are shopping here.
1,I am not a natual dancer.,"But I have been doing exercise DVD's long enough that with a little work I can pick up the routine. This one is different, however. Amy give you no time whatsoever with her cuing. She says it as she does it and the routine is fast, fast, fast! It would take me weeks and weeks just to get past the first routine! She does give you a move master type of thing to teach you her moves but unfortunately there is just a limited selection of what she does, it is not complete. I love Amy Bento but I will probably never do this one!"
3,Nice wood,"I was so excited for this stand. I put it together but it wobbles so bad. I had my hushband also tighten the screws but the glass top is so heavy, if I dont place it on a flat surface it leans to either the left or the right. Sometimes after a few drinks it fun to laugh at. Sad but still funny. Despite this it works and does the job. Its better than the old lady styles out there that have the plastic trim. Shame really as the components are nice quality and there is nothing cheap looking about it. Oh well after a party we know we have had a good night when its leaning."
5,Beautiful Cart,"My son is getting married in July so my girlfriends gave him an ""Outfit the Bar"" shower. I said I would get a tray or cart. When I found this online, I never imagined it would be as beautiful or high quality as it turned out to be! I'm delighted. The mirrored top (cannot see in this picture) is absolutely beautiful, especially with glasses set on the top. Really happy with this purchase. My husband said it was easy to put together. Great buy!"
4,Great Service,While I was a little bit hesitant to pruchase this item due to the time it would take to get here I was greatly surprised. It arrive much earlier than estimated. Definality will use this again!
3,curiousity,just one of many books on HW Armstrong. Satisfied my curiosity on a belief system of apparent works as opposed to grace alone. Mr Armstrong apparently thought a lot of himself believing that God called him to be a modern day prophet
2,incomplete,This pump came without a valve so it can't be used.My local bike store said that they never heard of this in all the years that they were in business. It is an inexpensive item.The company should send me one. My bike store only sells a completeunit. I will have to look for a used pump to get a valve. I strongly advise thatno one buy this product.
5,A solidly researched & splendidly presented DVD documentary,"Norman Rockwell: An American Portrait is a solidly researched and splendidly presented DVD documentary of Norman Rockwell, the American artist whose timeless caricatures became immortalized in more than 300 covers of the Saturday Evening Post -- among countless other works. The rich depths of his art (portraying all the moods and facets of humanity including success and failure alike), as well as the life and career of the man himself, are informatively and authoritatively covered in this simply outstanding presentation which originally aired as a PBS special. An excellent and very highly recommended celebration of a great artist's life and legacy, including additional features such as an art gallery and music selections from T. K. Blue and Nigel Clark, Norman Rockwell: An American Portrait is a full color, 60 minute DVD which would enhance any personal, school, or community collection."
3,There is navy and then there is NAVY,This was a nice quality belt. I returned it however because this navy was a bit lighter than the suit it was meant to compliment. If I can find a navy suit that was this color I would gladly by this belt again.
5,Great Salvation Army history!,"What I had hoped for when selecting this book was a history of Henry Milans. What I got was a history of God's work in the slums of America through The Salvation Army as told by Milans. It is a collection of almost 40 short stories of how God manages to work miracles in the lives of drunks, criminals and the like to bring them to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. It is a wonderful reminder that God can take the lowest of the low and save them to the uttermost. It is also a reminder that The Salvation Army exists to reach out to those in the scrap heaps of life and lift them up to know the love of Christ. This is great Army history, but is excellent reading and motivation for any Christian who has a heart for the downtrodden of this world!"
1,low quality,"When fully loading, the handles do not come out. You have to pull hard, so hard that I broke the handle.After three years, samsonite claims no longer to have replacement pieces. So think twice before buyng samsonitetwo year warranty, and after that you're screwed. What I call no quality . Every quality assurance plan I know ofhas a maintenance plan, if Samsonite's maintenance plan is for a period of three years, I think you'd better know this."
4,Pretty good,"I was hoping for to get the gaming elements of Harpoon II that I have for DOS. This edition does not contain any of those scenarios. It does load and operate from XP but, it is a bit more difficult to maneuver than the old DOS game. Still, I'm glad to have it."
4,sample-delic!!,"as far a sampledelica goes, this may be the wackiest entry in the genre yet. edgy, intense and funny, this pushes the limits without losing track of a basic musicality. recommended to fans of daft punk."
2,Poor sound quality!,"I was looking foward to getting this DVD only to realize that it was a very poor quality DVD. This was a low cost production with terrible sound,video and editing. For those who enjoy this genre of music, this DVD is to be avoided because it will certainly disappoint even hardcore fans, right down to the ""pirated look - flea market"" packaging."
2,Don't count on the plug in,"I bought this item after my original iPod nano chord was chewed by my cat. I liked the idea of being able to plug the iPod into the wall to charge it. But when I first received the dock, it wouldn't charge the iPod by simply plugging it into the wall. Then one day it suddenly worked. Now it doesn't again. It's not that complicated of an item, but I can't seem to figure out why the wall plug works sometimes and not others. The good part is the USB chord going to the computer works so I can charge it that way."
1,Lower Quality Than I Expected,"This air pump is of lower quality than I expected, especially for the price. I would not recommend it."
3,"It's OK, but not as good as the original","It's better than nothing, but the convex glass is not shaped the same as the original, and therefore not as effective."
3,I absolutelly love it... when it works...,"Mine initially came with a battery that wouldn't charge more than an hour's worth. Irobot service is great and they sent me a new battery. It worked great, picking up cat hair all over the place (that is mostly what my house is made off). However, it started doing the death spin about a week ago. (Roomba repeatedly starts and stops and/or spins in place. ) I went throught the website and followed their instructions, but it hasn't started working again. Hopefully, it will re-live.. or they'll send me a new one. As it is... I'm swimming in cat hair..... And I upright vaccumed 2 days ago..."
4,entertaining,"Works well. Only thing I encountered when I plugged it in to ""charge"" the first time it flashed red. The owners manuel said it should be amber, tried contacting co. and looking for question to- no avail, however when it was fully charged, it turned green and worked great. On the second ""recharge"" it flashed red again, so no idea what the amber in manuel unless the guy who wrote the manuel is color blind....otherwise pretty happy with it. Cleaning brushes same as with any Vac is a bit messing. When cleaning it doesn't seem to have any ""pattern"" no rhyme or reason, but seems to cover everything. I did have to have it do a room twice due to the dirt. It ran out of juice before finishing..."
4,lovely but runs larger than expected,"I'm usually a 3x, but next time I would have ordered at least a size smaller. I sew, so I'll just take this large one in a bit. I'm also 5'2"" and this almost drags the ground, good for someone a bit taller.It's very nicely made for the price, soft pretty fabric... just runs a bit large, which is not bad for most of us queen size ladies."
5,Actually my wife loves it.,"My wife has always bought Vanity Fair products, but fewer of the big stores seem to carry the quality merchandise anymore. They all seem to be into Pajamas for women and pretty feminine apparel has gone by the wayside."
2,Shadowline stretch lace bodice gown in black,The bodice area seems to stretch too much and doesn't have needed support. Otherwise was a good fit and comfortable.
4,very nice but very shear!,"Shipped very fast, and is very pretty. color is beautiful and fits like a dream. The only prob. it that it is completely see-through. It doesn't show in the picture, but it is very shear! Not so much a treat for you, more a treat for you partner."
3,White Stretch Lace nightgown,"The gown in ivory is very pretty, especially the bodice, but I was disappointed as to how thin the tricot was for the gown. It is very see through and I will have to add another layer of tricot to the lower part of the gown. At the price for the gown I was expecting it to be of heavier material. In a darker color maybe the thinness would not matter."
2,Not at All What I Excepted,This nightgown looked beautiful and most of the reviews were great so I ordered a small in black. When it first arrived I was surprised by how thin the gown was but the top of the gown seemed pretty. I put it on and it seemed a bit big -I am a small a size 4-6 and 5'8. Within an hour of wearing it the top started stretching out so I noticed myself having to pull the shoulders up and keep readjusting it. I finally just took it off as it was uncomfortable at that point and returned it. Really sad because I love the old Olga's and this type of night gown but just not the quality I expected for the price.
2,Long Ivory lace top gown,"This gown is well made, with no defects. While some ladies may find the gown to their liking, the stretch lace material of the bodice was irritating to my skin and the ivory color was FAR more see-thru than I desired."
2,Night gown,Shadowline Strech Lace Bodice Gown did not work for me because I have big brest and did not fit nicely in it. I would recomendid for smaller chestid girls.
2,Black lace top long gown,"The product is as described and I'm sure for some ladies the product would be great. However, for whatever reason, the stretch lace bodice was irritating to my skin and, the material was more see-thru than I desired. The product is well made with no defects."
4,"The collected sayings, puns and songs of Callahan's Place","Off the wall at Callahan's is a collection of all the best sayings that Mike Callahan collected over the years, some of the worst puns, and the nicest songs. There is also a short foreword by Spider explaining how this book came to be, and an section at the end listing the person who appeared over the various books in the Callahan's Saloon series. The book also features several cute interior illustrations by Phil Foglio, and is printed on acid-free paper (according to the jacket). While this book is NOT a collection of stories as are all the other books in this series, it DOES give valuable background and interesting tidbits. It's probably not a good book to get if you've not read any of the rest of the series, but if you have and liked them, it'll probably appeal to your taste. I liked this book very much myself, but could see where it might not appeal to non Robinson fans"
1,"Warning: This is NOT ""The Notebooks of Lazarus Long"".","I was extremely disappointed with this book. I have been a Spider Robinson and Callahan fan since the first book. Unfortunately, this book did not live up to my expectations. If you have read the ""Callahan's"" books, you have seen the good parts of the book (if you haven't, you need to get them right away! They are wonderful!). Most of the book is made up of sayings that are supposed to have been written on the wall of Callahan's Place. If this is all that was written, the wall should have been painted over a long time ago. Save your money, and buy the next Spider Robinson book that should be coming out soon."
3,Shorts,I like the author. I am not too impresses with this book but it is OK if you want to read all of the saying on Callahan's Wall.
2,Why did I get the feeling I waked in on a private party?,"Right off the bat ,I had never been in Callahan's Place,never even heard of it,never read any of Spider Robinson's books,and since Callahan's was destroyed on New Year's Eve 1984;what we're dealing with here is ""a blast from the past"".I am sure, if one had ever been there and knew any of the people who hung out there;this book would bring back many fond memories.However,not ever having been part of the scene;the humor in the book was very bland to me; as I am sure that the characters,the book is all about,is what would give it meaning.It reminded me of watching home movies;when you didn't know the people;not too interesting."
4,buy 2,youll want 2. one to read and keep the other to pull out the really good ones and put on your wall.
2,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT,"Bernie, is this the best you can do??? After 3 years with the Eagles (and some fine work at that), and success with the Burritos? I expected more, especially after hearing your Natural Progressions album from years back. I just got this CD and it SUCKS! I can't believe you have made your fans and Eagles fans alike wait for THIS! Judging from a few of the high star reviews already submitted, you must of had some family members grade it. Folks, maybe it's just me. Listen for yourself, but before you buy you might want to borrow a friend's copy before you spend your own money. I've just filed it into place with my other CD's and don't expect to retrieve it any time soon."
2,Beware,"I am a big fan of Bernie's work with the Eagles and his album with Michael Georgiades and like a lot of people, was excited to see this new release. I bought the CD without listening to it on the strength of the review from ""At Last"" from Wellington, New Zealand. You owe me $30 my friend ! I don't know whether the success of Lord of the Rings means that only fiction and fairy tales come out of New Zealand these days, or perhaps you're related to Bernie or work for his record company. The album is at best very ordinary, with average musicianship, weak material and flat production. It is very disappointing, but based on Mr Leadon's previous fantastic body of work, I guess he really doesn't have to prove anything to anyone."
2,Disappointed,"As a fan of the Eagles, the original four, I had always liked Bernie. In fact he was my favorite. I am disspointed in this disc. The music is fine and very well done. Lyrics are always a peek into the soul of the artist. The first cut on the record really says it all: ""I am a vile and profane man"" and Bernie is quite profane in his lyrics. That is something I just don't care for. Others may not be bothered, but I find it a unneccessary distraction. I must confess I held him in high esteem, but now quite disillusioned."
4,comprehensive introduction to glass architecture,"This is an interesting publication because this book try to bridge the history and technical aspect of glass and mr wigginton has explained clearly with examples (accompanying colorful illustration and working detail) shown in the book.The book is basically divided into 3 parts:1. history and theory - understanding the historical and theorical aspect of glass industry. (eg. the influence of Mies)2. examples - shows important examples of glass technology developement with detail illustrations. (eg. Pei's Louvre)3. Technical index - manufacturing, strength and U value of glass.This is a great survey book on glass architecture but one might find that the essay is not critical enough and the detail shown is not specific enough for further understanding of this subject matter.However, no readers would disagree that your paid money worth."
3,A Retrospective Glimpse of the end of an era.,"This is a 1970's production which highlights several night's performances of Duke and the Orchestra on their 1968 Mexican Tour, during which they performed (for the first time) the ""Mexican Suite"", (later to be completed and recorded as the ""Latin American Suite""... widely accepted as the best secular work of Ellington's final creative stage prior to his passing in 1974) This film was produced around 1975 or '76 and contains some heart felt studio interviews with then surviving band members Cat Anderson (tp) and Russell Procope (cl). Although the production tends to drag somewhat in places, it is nonetheless a very insightful look back at the genius of Ellington, and the passion with which his band members cared for him as their leader. This may not be the finest documentary, but it is well worth owning for its rare late-career concert footage and the insights and reflections of his players."
2,GOOD & BAD,"This is a decent low budget option, but the sound quality is lacking and we have had some problems with interference. If quality sound and no issues is what you're looking for, you may want to keep looking. On the plus side, it was great having multiple mics once we got around the interference issues."
3,Barely good enough!,"Purchased these for a 230 person capacity hall for PA. One of the mics sounds worse than the others and none sound particularly great. Requires a lot of careful adjustment to get them to sound somewhat acceptable. Once adjusted they worked and performed OK at best. Although not very clear, speech was understandable although somewhat muffled. With other mics, and some very cheap wired ones, the PA system actually sounds great, but with these the clarity was not where it should have been. Overall, they do the job, wireless and easily worn and voices amplified which is what they are meant to do. I would buy them again unless there is a better quality choice in a similar price range."
3,THE MICROPHONES ARE NOT THE SAME LIKE PICTURE,"I PURCHASED THIS ITEM, THE 401X QUAD WITH 2 MICROPHONES HANDLED AND TWO MICROPHONES LAVALIER I AM IN COLOMBIA AND I RECEIVED 4 MICROPHONES ALL LAVALIER, THIS IS NOT THE SAME LIKE PICTURE, NOW IS NOT POSSIBLE RETURN THE GOODS BECAUSE THE FREIGHT IS TOO EXPENSIVE. WHAT CAN DO AMAZON FOR SOLE MY PROBLEM?"
3,A PASSIONATE FLING,"A talented lady, no doubt about it, but I appreciated only about half the songs on this CD. She does an acceptable job when covering the Judy Garland hit, 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' but comes up short on other vocals. All in all, not a huge disappointment here but would I purchase more of her work? Doubtful."
1,one bad apple will spoil the bunch,"And likewise, plagiarizing parts of your book will ruin it - no matter if you revise your work later or not. This person wrote a piece of fanfiction and decided to self-publish it...well, at least wrote most of it. It turns out that she stole word for word entire sections from other stories and claimed them as her own. She had the guts to publish her plagiarizied story even after her theft was broadcast to the phandom and she was exposed for the thief she is. Now she has the guts to ""revise"" her story and publish it yet again? Don't buy this unless you like to support thieves.Please write your OWN story next time, Ms. Binkley."
5,Hilarious!,"This book was sooooooo funny. It had many embarassing stories, by other kids. I just couldn't put this book down. I recommend this to anyone who likes embarassing stories."
1,A Lot Worse Than It Appears,"When the book mentions that it has ""Embarrassing stories by kids just like you""... well... The stories are not even embarrassing. They should say Funny or Sort Of Embarrassing stories by kids just like you. Also the book is only 82 pages long, has enormous print, and measures only 4 x 7 inches.My advice, Don't Buy It, Its A Total Rip Off! If you do you'll be disappointed!"
4,My TweenThought Movie Was Great.,We ordered this for my 10 year old daughter.She will be having a movie party for her birthday.She pre-screened the movie and thought it was great.Perfect for tweens.
1,Dissapointing!,"I don't even know how to explain this, because I've never seen it before. Simply, I didn't find a single actor to act well in this movie, although it was not a low budget movie. My boyfriend just said that they wrote ""Looking for low budget actors"" for the casting. If you liked ""Legally Blonde"" don't watch this one, they have nothing in common. By the way the camera guy shooting during the landscape scenes is great, but the one that shoots during people talk obviously doesn't know how to hold the camera. So obviously it was the worst movie I've seen in a lot of time and I regret I choose to watch this one instead of ""Disaster movie""1/5"
2,True life story of pollution with the names changed.,"A young Michigan dairy farmer and his family start having illness among their herd. The government agencies he turns to for help are inadequate to research the problem. The farmer conducts his own investigation and dicovers PBB contamination, carelessness, government lack of action and coverups. He must take action to protect the public."
5,A TRUE STORY THAT SHOULD BE ON DVD,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED WHY ISNT THIS MOVIE ON DVD? IT IS A REAL TEAR JERKER AND WILL REALLY MOVE YOU .THIS MOVIE WILL KEEP YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT.THE MOVI IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY WHERE TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WERE CONTAMINATED BY CHEMICAL POISIONING A COVER-UP INSUED MANY PEOPLE AND ANIMALS DIED FROM THIS I WONT GIVE AWAY THE ENDING AS YOU SHOULD BUY OR RENT THIS MOVIE .
5,WILL I EVER DRINK MILK AGAIN?,this movie the the peanuts out of youif you live in the midwest states the this is a definetmust see
3,Could have been better,He never really answers the important questions directly but you will learn some. I think it could have been produced better.
3,Bad Ending,"I have to agree with the other review that states the ending is BLAND (those are kind words). Ok, so you learn she is not a robot (I think) because she gets the chicken pox but nothing is done to explain Ms. Botts weird behavior, dress, gadgets etc. The ending is so non-climactic that it leads you to question even what one would think is most obvious, that she's NOT a robot because robots can't catch chicken pox. It ""leaves you hanging"" and rather disappointed. I find myself searching the web to see if I've missed something in the story line to explain the story. Having said that, I loved the rest of the book....it was interesting and kept you wanting to read the next chapter to find out what was going to happen. The 3 stars was for the great story minus the HORRIBLE ending."
1,Don't waste your time.,"I thought that this would be good, but it stunk! The ending is so bland that I almost threw up. Please don't read this book or waste your money and/or time reading this. Please don't! Maybe the next one will be better - I haven't read it."
2,Fell Flat SO fast...,"This book started out great, I thought Geoffrey was a great, sexy hero, and I thought his relationship - his friendship with Catherine was sweet. For some reason, the book stumbled into boredom rather quickly, though. Also, Christian wasn't that likeable here. And it took little imagination to write this one, as it was nearly the same story as THE DUMONT BRIDE."
4,the value of this text...,"I think that the value in this book lies in the deviation of thought from anything mainstream. Even though you might not agree with everything or anything in this book, Osho guides you through a world of thought that many of us had not even heard of. It frees you from a way of thinking that we are used to every single day. A good book to pick up and gain perspective when the problems pile up one after another. You will gain a new way of looking at freedom and a new way to define freedom. And althought I doubt that I, or most other people that will pick up this book, will alter their lives significantly, there are many words of wisdon to pick up. Afterall, all that we need sometimes is a breath of fresh air."
5,Freedom: The Courage to Be Yourself,"for all who know Osho, this is defnetly a must-have!for all others, get ready to ask yourself some provocating questions!"
4,Spritual Freedom is real!,"Osho explains different types of freedom and concludes that the real freedom is spiritual freedom when our mind is free from 'conditioning'--you recognize yourself and have courage to be true to yourself.The book has endearing style with anecdotes sprinkled here and there. The author presents convincing arguments with compassion and love which a receptive reader will certainly like.Overall, the book is quite good!"
4,Love it!,"Osho. You either love him or dislike him but he will always get a reaction. What I like about all his writings is that he is able to challenge us on our way of thinking. In this day and age we seemed to have become so locked in a way of thought that has no freedom and has no awareness. Yes he has some radical ideas but he also challenges to explore how we have been taught and how valuable that really is. Freedom is not about doing anything you choose to do, but rather doing whatever it is with a mindfulness that is brought about by deep reflection. He is teaching us to ask ourselves why do we do certain things. Do we know why? When we do know this can brings about a profound freedom.Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"
3,"Great Camera, Mediocre Accessories","This camera is great. The Sony takes excellent photos in nearly all lighting conditions. The case has held up great for 4 years now.I did break the camera tripod relatively soon after purchase, and the original memory card had a corruption issue that gave me shadows of old images."
3,could be better,It requires some time for auto focus in mny shots.Had a malfunction that required a repair during the guarantee.
3,Gift for my Great Nephew,The item was very small for $19.99. I was expecting something much bigger. I would'nt have spent $19.99 if I knew it was this small. It was simple to use for a 3 year old.
1,very displeased,"I ordered this book thinking that it was an actual copy of the book, buy when I received it it was actually an ebook. Never did it say anywhere that that's what it was. What a waste of money especially because I need a copy of this book every time I'm in that class."
4,Pretty Good,"I live in a dorm where I can only cook using a microwave, and I found knorr sides to be perfect for that. This one tastes pretty good, although not the best of the knorr sides. Cooks in only 12 minutes in the microwave."
1,Disappointment,"I was very pleased with this product which I gave as a gift to my son and his wife until they used them. The heat of the grill melted the plastic plug used to fasten the ringed cap to the handle. The plastic messed up the grill, the skewers are now ugly, and the skewers are harder to turn without the rings to fork into. Who would ever think that plastic would be part of a stainless steel skewer?"
3,Good for the Price,"Unit would have gotten 4 stars if the cordless portion of the system did not get so much intereference. I have other Uniden 5.8ghz corldess units and they work great. This one not so much. you get about 10-15 feet away and you get static. Luckly u only bought it because i needed a cheap desk phone. The base unit here is very good. Comfortable and good speaker phone. for the price i guess it is not bad having to deal with the cordless, considering i have other corless units it is no problem. But don't buy thie unit if you NEED to have the cordless, only get it if the cordless will be considered a plus."
1,horrible battery life....chronic uniden problem?,Second uniden product in 2 months...to be returned...battery life of cordless phone is really bad....lasts about 2 days max...with prob 3hrs usage....my old panasonic cordless would go for a week despite constant use...perhaps panasonic is a more power efficient. So back to panasonic I go..
4,Price is right - some features missing,"I've had this phone for about a week and I really like. It is just what I was looking for - inexpensive with a corded desk phone. It was easy to set up and works fine. I keep the cordless handset in the same room as the base, so the reception is great.This is a very basic phone but there are some handy features that are missing: You cannot plug a headset into the base (though a speakerphone is available). There is no speakerphone on the cordless handset (though you can use a headset). There are only 10 speed dials.Also for your information, during a power outage you can use the handset of the base but the speakerphone, answer machine, and all other functions are disabled."
1,Refurbished Nightmare,"I bought this phone as a refurbished since I've never had a problem when purchasing refurbished. At first, both phones worked fine. Then after 2 weeks, the speaker on the Corded phone went out. A few days later, the cordless phone stopped working. Needless to say, I've cut my losses and will never buy anything refurbished from this seller again."
2,my second...and my last!,"This is my second Uniden phone and both have battery problems after one year. Battery packs are 8-15 bucks,why not switch to ""AAA"" batteries Uniden???? The corded handset is cheaply constructed, the reception is subject to interference, and handset talk time is shorter than advertised, more. I switched to the competitor and I am happy with the product(s). You can read my other reviews if you can find the one or two I wrote. Seldom do I complain or buy something I haven't researched thoroughly, but I did make a mistake buying these two units!!"
1,Not worth it,"The reception on this phone is not very good, and the cordless handset does not work very well. The caller id has never worked on the cordless handset. Otherwise, it's ok. I wouldn't reccommend this product."
5,new phones,I love this phone. It has so many features I have not been able to use them all. I love having a second phone that is portable and has it owns charging base. Great phone. A+
4,The best product for organic growers,"For anyone wanting to control weeds without toxins, this stuff is really great. I did say 'control' weeds, not 'kill' weeds. This stuff won't kill perennial weeds, because it's not a systemic, and therefore won't kill humans and animals either. We control weeds by a combination of curse words, hand-weeding, and Burnout. We have extensive gravel paths, and hand-weeding exposes more seeds for germination. Burnout keeps the tops burned down and the gravel in place. Perennials get pulled by hand or repeatedly burned down. It all works out in the end, and the nice clove smell reminds us we're not using Roundup."
1,Disappointed with Burnout II,"I bought Burnout II because I needed an organic herbicide to kill some leftover grassy ground cover in my yard without being hazardous to my dogs. After reading other reviews on this product, it was suggested that this herbicide is not a danger if a human or animal happen to ingest. However, once I received the bottle, it had several poison warnings about what to do if ingested. The plants that I sprayed didn't die, and my dogs were immediately drawn to the plants that I sprayed. I don't recommend Burnout if you are looking for a pet friendly herbicide."
4,Fussy pump handle,The Burnout is fantastic and it smells good too. The pump handle is cheap and broke within minutes though. I had to transfer the contents to my own spray bottle.
3,needs a lot of repeat applications,"I've used this product 3 times in the last 2 weeks at dilutions slightly higher than recommended and my perennial weeds keep coming back. I'm applying under ideal conditions: hot and sunny and relatively early in the growing season. Dandelion leaves turn brown but a week later they're springing to life again. I'll use it a few more times, after all I bought a giant,expensive container. I really want to have faith in the product. For now I'm on hold. I'm using it in the Seattle area."
1,"Good for 6 months, then battery slowed waaayy down","I bought it late last year. After about 6 months the battery would barely hold a charge. It is good for about 10 minutes now, although a bit dim."
2,On the disappointing side,"This reminds me of the old flashlights you would see on airplanes for the stewardess (I specifically used stewardess because that is how old these look). The flashlight is very lightweight and small (the size of a phone receiver). In fact, it is smaller than I expected and not as powerful as I thought. It doesn't have a wide range, so it doesn't have enough power to light up an area.I bought two of these for occasional power outages, which seem more frequently lately. In general, they have worked so far. My biggest disappointment is that they do not have an automatic setting that will turn them on in a power outage, although the little red light means you can spot them if you have a direct line of sight. So, I suggest keeping them in locations that are unobstructed and easy to reach.The only real outstanding thing is the free shipping. That brings the price down and makes it tolerable."
2,Rechargeable batteries don't last very long,"We purchased several of these flashlights for our office just over a year ago and have not really had to use them. However, when checking them to make sure they were in working order, we have discovered one by one, the batteries are dying. They are also not a standard size which makes replacement difficult. I don't think its unreasonable to expect these to last more than a year at this price."
1,Do not buy this flashlight!!!,"This is a terrible flashlight. I purchased this flashlight quite some time ago to replace a rechargeable flashlight that we had forever that finally wore out. We plugged it and assumed it would work but didn't check it until several months later. It does not hold a charge at all. Unfortunately, we did not keep the return slip or packaging from Amazon. I have never written a review before but I thought it was worth my while to warn everyone not to purchase this item."
1,Don't Buy This!,First one received did not charge. Returned to Amazon for replacement. Second one worked for about a month. What a waste of money! DO NOT BUY!
2,Great while it lasted,"I loved this flashlight and used it often for about a year, then it just died. Sad, but will probably order another one as it's so neat while it lasted."
1,A Rip Off,"This This Flash Lite is not even worth one star, when it is on there is a BLACK spot in the center of the light, so it's like not even having the light on. SAVE YOUR MONEY I would NOT Recomand it to Anyone!!!!"
1,"Short Battery Life, Low Return on Investment","I've had this Dorky flashlight for less than a year and it's had very little use, but the rechargeable batteries need replacement and they are not available at local stores, nor are they available from the manufacturer at this time. My experience with the Garrity rechargeable flashlight has been much better. I've had several of the Garrity model rechargeable (E300GS) over several years and they're great. They come on automatically during a power failure. I'd highly recommend the Garrity over the Dorky. [...]"
5,Shallow ND,"This CD is excellent if you're a fan of the Melvins or Sludgemetal style. Shallow North Dakota's first CD was released under the name ""Shallow"" titled -Auto Body Crusher (on Sonic Unyon in 1994). It was a bit heavier. 'Apparatus' is cleaner. Other bands that complement this album are Kittens-bazooka and the Hustler or Bliss-Grafted to and Elbow."
1,What. A. Bore.,"A self-indulgent, multi-syllabic, blathering bore.I was tremendously disappointed, and couldn't stay interested enough to get through the first half. It seemed to be a rambling thesis in which every sentence begins with I. If Rodriguez were a capitivating character it might have worked, but I was unable to care about him or his alienation.I predict this will be required reading for some unfortunate cultural anthropology graduate students, and they will dread every page, it is that kind of book."
2,Brown made me green,"I was partial to the tome, or at slightest the components I could comprehend. The additional ingredients were thoroughly bewildering and I didn't comprehend what a plenty of the vocabulary intended. It made it problematical to read. Plus he feigns kind of haughty in the manuscript so I didn't be fond of that either. Parts of his composition had the effect of possibly enacting me to purge my victuals. Perhaps I would be keen on the manuscript more if it was composed by a different novelist."
2,Another spokesperson for Brown People,"I am still trying to find out who made Rodriguez a spokesman for the Latino""s. Its people like Rodriguez who profess to know all there is to know about us as a people. In the process he completely disregards the diversity within our own communities. The danger that the Rodriguez and others like him is that his audience is mostly Anglo because Latinos know that Rodriguez is but one more that professes to speak for us. I think of Rodriguez more like Al Sharpton professing to speak for African/Americans. He at least has a few relative points to make in regards to knowing his subjuects. America has to realize that just like we didnt choose all the names that identify us a people, Spanish, Hispanic, Latinos. Rodriguez is just one more educated Brown man that maybe has some of White America believing he is THE guy that speaks for us... heres a hint... HE DOSENT speak for Latinos."
3,Brown,"Brown is an interesting read and by no means is it an easy read. Rodriguez alludes to many different things, so a reader, such as myself, may not always be able to pick up on these allusions. This is a story, rather a collection of stories that highlights race, ethnicity, and identity in American culture. This is a dense read, not a quick and easy read. At first, I did not understand many of the things Rodriguez was saying, but as I progressed farther in the book, his writing became much more clear and understandable to me. In the end, I cannot say that I enjoyed the book but that I did find it an interesting read and worth my time."
2,Why bother reading it? It will only irritate you!,"I hate Brown. It is wrong about everything. It has no good aspects. Brown is pointless.But perhaps this review would be better if I told you what he is specifically wrong about, or what aspects of the book I m referring to when I say that it isn't good. And perhaps, in order to avoid being a hypocrite, I could tell you the point of my arguments. Without qualifying my statements, I am being just as obnoxious as Rodriguez. If I clarified my complaints, perhaps this might become a review rather than a rant."
2,Brown Fluff,"Richard Rodriguez' ""Brown"" clearly showcases his mastery of the essay form as well as a lack of substance that makes it an ultimately unsatisfying read. In his eagerness to validate the Latino experience this book deteriorates all too often into a name-dropping frenzy when it comes to American and European writers. It is fascinating how Rodriguez fails to mention the works of other Latino writers in what can only be seen as his effort to elevate himself above them in a most self-serving way. The book contains a number of interesting insights, but it could stand a lot of editing and would probably have been better issued as a magazine article. It's brown fluff that tries to set Rodriguez up as the major interpretor of the Latino experience by way of brown-nosing white intellectuals. Rodriguez's ""Brown"" has an bitter aroma that combines individual self-promotion with group deprecation. I was deeply disappointed, considering all the hype it has received in the white media."
1,Save your money.,"Pathetic...really low budget,cheesy and annoying. Too bad I cant return it. The stories were predictable and common...they were'nt that scary or convincing. And the editing, camera tricks and music are dated, '80's style. I wouldnt even give it one star if they had no star for the rating. Your better off watching ""Unsolved Mysteries""."
5,"Complete, objective eBay coverage","Other books I've read were obviously published as PR pieces for eBay, but the eBay PowerUser's Bible is the real deal! Whether you're a new or experienced eBayer, buyer or seller, this book covers everything you'll need to know. Since I've bought this book I've been able to earn some serious cash through eBay. The troubleshooting tips alone make this worth the purchase price."
3,"Good book, but...","Second edition: I found this book to be a fairly thorough introduction to eBay buying and selling, use of TurboLister, and some good pointers; I learned a lot about listing and sales management from it; however, one of the chapters was truncated in the middle and jumped to an entirely different chapter, and I found several typos, incorrect grammar, and very confusing statements that didn't seem to fit into the subject matter. If I were Holden, I'd be really upset with the publisher, and Holden obviously didn't read his own book as closely as I did. If you can handle all the flaws, you'll learn a great deal from the book, but I only rated it 3 stars b/c I feel an author and publisher owes it to the buying public to get the writing and content correct!"
4,Bring your note pad...,"Greg Holden covers a very wide range of eBay topics. The best way to read this book is with a pen and note pad close by. Pick a chapter and jot down the key points - or better yet, jot down your new ideas! We have been selling for two years, and still saw 2-3 things per chapter to add to our program.~Tc"
1,not so compact,"i got this for a charter44 bulldog, the grips are no smaller than the stock grips it also required some modification to get a good fit not recommended to novice gun owner who wants plug and play action. i realy dont like them as good as the stock grips"
2,RESPONSE DUKE NUKEM'S WARNING,"MR. NUKEM IS CORRECT THAT BORAGE OIL CAN CONTAIN PYRROLIZIDINE ALKOLOID (P.A.) WHICH IS TOXIC FOR THE LIVER, BUT P.A. IS CONTAINED IN THE LEAVES OF THE PLANT ONLY AND IN SMALL AMOUNTS (10PPM). HOWEVER, THE SEED DOES NOT CONTAIN HARMFUL ALKALOIDS. BORAGE SEED OIL IS THE HIGHEST KNOWN PLANT BASED SOURSE OF GAMMA-LINOLENIC ACID AND IS EASILY TOLERATED BY MOST PEOPLE. HOWEVER, BEFORE TAKING ANY SUPPLEMENT, REFER TO YOUR DOCTOR BECAUSE PERSONS ON BLOOD THINNERS AND OTHER HEALTH CONDITIONS PROBABLY SHOULD NOT BE TAKING THIS SUPPLEMENT. ALSO, DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. THERE IS SO MUCH INFORMATION OUT THERE ABOUT THIS SUPPLEMENT. BY THE WAY, I ONLY RATED THE ITEM 2 STARS BECAUSE AMAZON DOES NOT LET YOU LEAVE FEEDBACK WITHOUT SOME TYPE OF RATING. I CAN'T HONESTLY RATE THIS ITEM BECAUSE I'VE ONLY BEEN TAKING IT FOR THE PAST WEEK. I WILL EDIT MY REVIEW IN A MONTH OR SO AND GIVE A HONEST STAR RATING. BE WELL . . ."
4,What can stop true love?,"I read this book as a teenager, and to this day, (many years later) I still have the images this story created, soldered to my soul. It was not only romantic, but frightening. A young couple are deeply in love. It looks like it may end, but then again..."
5,Great read on Marketing & Management,"I just finished The Management Mine Field and am thoroughly impressed with Paradiso's insight into critical marketing and management issues. Whether it's rolling out a new product or steering senior management, Paradiso offers timely advice for both rooky & seasoned marketeers & managers.Paradiso uncovers the 'obvious' in clear, straight-to-the-point prose. Amusing stories are frequently used to explain basic concepts for successful marketing. A quick and enjoyable read that should be on everyone's summer reading list!I highly recommend The Management Mine Field to all current or would be marketers and senior managers."
1,It's all about Tony,"Don't waste your time with this one. The author has a snappy writing style, but his insights are mundane. The whole book says nothing more than interpersonal relations and politics matter. That's not a unique perspective.The book really combines basic marketing and mangement material (the kind you get in an undergrad business school) with trivia about himself (his musical ability, his IQ scores, his high school class standing). There is too much cutesy jargon (play with the big boys, uhhs, knee vs. nuts jokes, I, I, I, me, me, me). The only section that might be worth a read is the chapter on competition, but he does not cite his sources, so it is unclear if his information and analysis carries weight"

5,Amazing information source,"I can not believe this book is out of print. A few years ago I spent two weeks in Paris walking a large numbers of these tours. They are set to take the observer from one Metro stop to another through one or more neighborhoods. It is best for an architect or a serious traveller who enjoys looking at, and finding out information about, buildings. It is not a single source of information for the city or a general guidebook by any means. Another great pleasure while using this book is experiencing some of the lesser known areas of Paris that are off of the normal tourist routes. A great, great resource. Get a copy if you can find one."
2,no ending,"This book is the first of a series - even though there is no indication of that until the inside of the back page. Towards the end, the real story just stops progressing and the book becomes mostly filler. I was very annoyed when I realized there was going to be no ending. I didnt even read the last 20 pages."
3,Tedious for me...could have been great,"The cover art, jacket blurbs, and an interesting premise all gave me high hopes, but at the end of the day this story is thinly developed, choppily written, and poorly edited. The last half was so tedious that I skipped at least every other page without missing anything important. It could have been great."
5,The Meq,"I loved the book from the first time I heard Steve Cash's daughter, Star read the first chapter at school. I asked to have our book autographed, which he kindly did for us. It was great reading. We read as a family. It was captivating. We couldn't wait to get back together to read in the evenings."
5,"Lyrical, exciting, wonderous novel","Just a beautiful book, and since I've read all three in the series, let me plug the others as well. Cash's novels are a wonderful take on fantasy and vastly deserving of a much wider readership. Don't neglect this gem!"
2,Why do I care?,What started out as a fresh set of ideas soon disitingrated into a boring read. Mr. Cash fails to adequately develope the characters. Ultimately I found myself wondering why I cared what was going to happen to the main character. Suffice it to say that a group of Meq were on a decades-spanning mission. The goal of the story and the players were so shallowly developed that I stopped reading the book with 50 pages to go.
2,"Interesting premise, failed delivery","I have never understood how readers could fail to get into a novel . . . until I started to read The Meq. I tried and tried to get involved but could not. The first chapters were great - full of emotion and provided a nice introduction to characters (including Solomon, the best character in the book.) However, after the introduction of Georgia and Carolina the story steadily decilined. There were too many characters that didn't add anything but confusion to the story line and not much to make the different story lines interesting. Perhaps what really irritated me most was the span of time devoted to finding Carolina's child Star. To be completely honest, I merely skimmed the many chapters detailing this event, otherwise I would have never finished to book. I feel that Cash may have been setting us up for the next book in the series, but this was so horribly delivered that I don't care to delve any further into the series."
5,The Meq,"I read this book in a short time and I enjoyed every page. The story line of a race of child-people was unique and fresh, and the characters are interesting and memorable. ""The Meq"" is part one of a trilogy and I can't wait for book #2 to come out."
2,"Very disappointing album, but for a couple songs","I bought this album based on the song Mr. and Mrs. Ness, which rocks pretty hard. Every song on the album, with the exception of the above and one other, is retarded. It almost sounds like a joke. The guys voice is a mix between Danzig, Elvis, and Cher. No good"
5,great deal and awesome music,Ican't wait to hear what they come out with next. They use multiple musical styles and don't limit themselves to one genre.
2,Not One of the Better Books,"I found many of the Strange Matter books to be excellent, if not for their insight or thought-provoking material, than for their ""fun"" plots. This, however, is not a good book, even to kill time with. Pick up Bad Circuits or Something Rotten instead."
2,Small and diaper/wipes pouch too small,"This product is OK but not worth the extra few dollars for the wipes/diaper pouch. Newborn diapers barely fit in the pouch, meaning extremely limited use as the baby grows. I would instead buy the changing kit without the pouches for the money (I suppose you can put diaper ointment, etc, in the pouches, but it seems to me like they just will get in the way)."
2,Low quality and small,"The pad is rather small but I would have still used it if it hadn't come with a broken zipper. I immediately returned it for a refund, will be ordering a different one."
1,VEEEEERYYYYYY irresponsable,"I am really angry with the seller, i wrote 6 e mails request the tracking number of my stuff, only receive one answer that promise to me the number for the next day, and i am still waiting , i suppose that my thing could be deliver at October 13 (seller promise), but today (octuber 26) i do not receive nothing, no answer for the seller, no tracking number neither my stuff that i paid, i do not Recommend this seller at all."
3,Whoops!,"Unable to fairly rate product...ordered wrong item. Wanted female shoes, ordered male shoes in error."
2,Disappointed at the limited amount of text,"This is a coffee table book. The reviews I read did not make this clear. I was expecting a novel-lenght work; the text itself could be read in 2 hours or less. The pictures are beautiful - if you like grainy black and white photos. The book is a fine at what it is, but it is not what I expected. On the whole, I was disappointed."
5,Breathtaking!,The photographs of Eric Hoisington are exceptional.... I'd love to see more of him in the future.
2,Was working for a few days but seems to have stopped heating,"The light on the back of the machine comes on but it no longer gets hot. I did not let the fog level get too low and I always unplugged it when not in use. I tried other outlets, same deal.This is my third day using this fog machine, used it for a total of about 2.5 hours.When it worked, it worked well. I It felt pretty strong on the outside but clearly something is wrong on the inside.I'll have to return this :-\"
1,Doesn't Work,"This product arrived on time BUT it doesn't work. I've tried 6 different outlets in my house. The ""red light"" that is supposed to come on, doesn't. I put the branded fog juice in it and the system won't turn on to heat it. It was brand new and opened when I tried it. Very dissapointed."
3,What the Leak?!,"It works very well. But, it leaks everywhere. Have to use it on a tray in order to keep my floors clean. Other than that, if you don't mind cleaning your floors all the time, it makes fog really well, and it doesn't use much fog juice (I thought I was going to have to get juice constantly, but it's pretty efficient)."
4,Works for what I need it to do.,Works pretty well. Produces a lot of smoke. It is kind of annoying how you have to wait for it to heat up each time you want to spray some fog. But it works for my photo shoots and videos.
5,Dang! it's powerful,"This 700 watt fog machine can shoot fog out non stop for about 30-50 seconds! It's a great machine and had for about a year now. Just make sure to maintain the machine and use designated fog juice to keep it working.Tips:When storing for a long time like I did for every Halloween, simply fill the machine with clean fog juice all the way up and leave it that way! Just make sure to pump fog at least once a month so nothing gets dusty and clogged over time!"
4,Good purchase experience,"The product arrived in the expected time. Nicely packaged, and had all the parts. I put the fog juice in it and the machine worked like a charm. I later found out however, that the machine must remain perfectly level, or else it will leak the fog juice. I learned this when transporting the machine so I suppose if it stays in one place it shouldn't be a problem."
4,Good Fog,Makes great fog! I would suggest purchasing a timer so you don't have to monitor the machine and activate the fog... Much more practical!
1,Don't waste you money!!!,"This cd is very bad. There are virtually no interviews from the guys--a couple of blurbs from Robby is all, the music is musak (nothing by the GGDs), and the woman reading the ""biography"" doesn't even pronounce John Rzeznik's name correctly (she says Yeznik). Please don't waste your money. I would recommended ANYTHING from the Goo Goo Dolls--I am a huge fan--except for this."
1,USELESS MISINFORMATION,"Anyone interested in purchasing this recording should know that it contains NO Goo Goo Dolls music. It is nothing more than a women reciting facts (some correct and some questionable) about their career from varoius bios, interviews, and rumors. In fact, the woman can't even pronounce the band members' names. There are some excerpts from audio interviews with the band. Too bad some of them are actually the voice of Mark Mcgrath from Sugar Ray. Overall this CD is a waste of time."
1,i was very wrong on the first review,"Goo Goo Dolls need more respect. In this biography the british women or who ever, does not even say rzeznik in stead she says yeznik. There is some stuff the goos say but i noticed all of it was not the goos some was sugar ray come on whos biography is this GOO GOO DOLLS or sugar rays.Forgive me on my first review forgive me for"
1,Don't buy this,I am a devoted goo fan and found this disc to be really bad. It's cheaply done and inaccurate.
1,Such a waste of money!,"This is such a big waste of money, it's not funny. About the only thing I was happy from this CD was the picture on the CD. The pronouncation of names were incorrect. The information provided were in certain places incorrect. I was so disappointed with this CD, I feel like I need my money back!"
2,Tormented in Texas,"Being a very advid fan of the Goo.I found the whole disk to be a total disapointment, very out of the Goo Goo Dolls normal sound and lyrics.Maybe just me but I did not feel the energy or desire in which was felt from them when they first arrived on the circut.I do hope that the next realease will be a blowout Top10 no holds bared.Come on Goo's get it together.Waiting and Tormented in Texas."
5,This one is a keeper,"I love this device. It works as advertised and I can hear callers under any conditions and they can hear me. I wish the company would make a similar one but capable of stereo music too (hint, hint). It's rugged and other than it being a bit too bulky, I can't find anything to complain about."
4,This DVD was awsome!,"Goku is on snake way trying to reach King Kai before the sayans arrive (Nappa power level at 4,000 and Vegeta at 18,000) And little old Gohan training with piccolo could have been easier. Vegeta and Nappa are waiting to get their wish of eternal life after coming to earth after Radditz died. In my oppinion Nappa the loser has a low fighting power and the puny earthlings can't beat him (that's in the later episode!) and their puny powerlevels are about 1,800 (that's tiens!) Well Gotta go and also buy Frieza death of a prince where Vegeta dies."
3,SnakeWay,"This DVD starts off with Goku falling off of snake way, and trying to trick two ogres into letting him get back on track. The shirts on the ogres reads HFIL, which stands for Home For Infinite Losers. This was edited from saying HELL, which is where Goku really is. Goku comes across more problems when he meets Princess Snake, who tries to seduce and eat him, and Gohan runs away from Piccolo. Although a good DVD, it is not the best and only gets a three from me."
2,Not worth the money,"The first one I ordered ripped when we had a little rain and wind. Not much of a storm either. The plastic cords that wrap on the bottom of the chairs were pulled up and off and were torn from the actual cover. So I sent it back in and got another one thinking that maybe this one was just defective....yeah umm, no. The second cover came and the same thing happened. One windy night and the cords ripped from the cover and off the patio set."
2,Fair VB overview. NOT an exam guide!!,This book does nothing more than make a fair attempt to teach VB to newbies. How they can get away with advertising their book as a certification guide is beyond me. They hardly even mention the MSCD exam at all! It is impossible for one book to try to teach VB to newbies as well as prepare professionals for the certification exam. McGraw Hill should be ashamed of themselves for giving the book such a grand title.
2,Just buy the Programmer's Guide,I liked their class so I bought this book. What a let down. If you just buy the programmer's guide you will do much better on the exam. At least Microsoft has editors go through their books. If your interested in passing the exam get the Microsoft book instead. Their class is pretty good but look at this book carefully before you choose to waste your money. Amazon has several other books which cover the material in a more professional and acute manner.
2,NO teeth in their bite,"An entry level programmer could have done a better job of putting a book together. Scot if you ever read this, next time you write a book try to put yourself in the shoes of the people whom you're trying to teach and think less about how much the royalties are going to be. The examples are weak at best and the typos become a little too much after awhile. People learn best by reading and doing. Maybe a little less lecturing will bring you back to reality. Don't throw your talent away by putting out trash like this."
1,Bootcamp for twinks...,"This book is so poor that it should have been published by Microsoft. I think that these guys actually do have some connection with MS. If you read this book however, you'll find that it is not programming VB. Maybe it is just getting people to waste their money."
1,"Very disappointing, don't waste your money","As an intermediate/adv VB developer I was interested in focusing on getting my certification. This book is no help at all. The title is very misleading. It should be called Introduction to Visual Basic 5.0 for Beginners ONLY. I will not buy another book written by Mezick or Hillier. This is the worst book I have ever purchased. I would have given it 0 stars, but it was not an option."
2,But it's NOT A MCSD CERTIFICATION GUIDE!,"Why is this book titled ""Certification Exam Guide""? Should be ""Random Notes on VB5"". I like the book's format and style. The author starts each chapter with a synopsis, overview and objectives. Too bad each chapter if literally filled with errors - both technical and typographical. I can accept an occasional error but when the author completely confuses topics (ie. ""subclassing"" with ""superclassing"") then I can't feel confident in the material. I took the MCSD Exam for VB5 and I can honestly say that this book would have been a liability more than an asset! Hey, authors, the default recordset type is not dbOpenTable - it's dbOpenDynaset! (This was a question on the exam.) I've emailed the publisher over 20 times to inquire about an errata to the book but no reply. Take this into consideration when you are looking at purchasing this book."
3,"Not as advertised, but has some good features","As other readers have commented, this book needs editing, contains errors, and will not teach you most of what you need for the MS Certification exam. It really is an intro to VB. But what I DID like about the book is that their ""Check It Out"" exercises got me USING VB, rather than just reading about VB. This emphasis on using the product as you read the book is more effective than most books programming books, where it's easy to read, forget half of what you read, and never really use the product."
2,Horrible software interface,"Title of the review says it, but more specifically:1. Synchronizing multiple units is cumbersome, i.e. you must enter the delayed start time in days, hours, minutes, the software doesn't let you enter a date and time directly.2. Unit won't do less than a ten second sampling. Relatively minor issue, as it does say in the spec's about sampling rates.In a nutshell, if you only have one point to monitor, then this unit will probably fill your needs nicely. If you need to monitor multiple points, keep searching; there's got to be more user friendly software by other pressure logger manufacturers."
1,"Instead it should be tittled ""The pessimist broken hearted who wrote Monogamy""","This book only speak threw a point of view of a pessimist, broken hearted cheated person. It was like opening someones diary in search of an aswer and it was ramblings about why monogamy is practicly imposible and an Utopic idea"". I didn't like this book because like everyone else or the 95% of us, I believe that a relationship is something you work on and hopefuly youll find someone who loves you and want to spend the rest of their lives with you. That's why to me this book was just a deception. I wanted to understand the concept, maybe read into experiances that led this person into a knoledge that I dont posses."
3,"Not for fans of verse, chorus, verse, chorus.","How much odd do you like in a single serving? That will determine your appreciation for this math rock influenced folk music. The music might be folk influenced math rock. It might be neither. I like pretty high dose of odd. I like Incredible String Band, Olivia Tremor Control, Einsturzende Neubaten and Robert Wyatt. Add another star if you utilize pscyhotropic drugs for music listening."
4,faithful adaptation of Benson's beloved Lucia,"These two discs contain five episodes of a faithful 1984 British television adaptation of one of EF Benson's comic novels. The book is set in a seaside village during the 1920s, where social butterfly Mapp is loathe to part with her hold over Tilling's residents when proto-diva Lucia comes to town. The tortured machinations of the two women is very funny and, as usual, the sets and costumes are lovely.The dvd set is ultra-minimal! Not even cast and crew info. Nothing."
3,Returning Mapp & Lucia was hard to do.,I've been a big fan of this series and was over the moon to see it hit the dvd shelves. Without a hesitation I bought Series One and quickly settled down to revisit the glorious world of Mapp and Lucia. Egads!... What did they do to the transfer?? The sound level bounced all over the place and became such a distraction I hurried back to the store for a replacement. With a new copy in my dvd player I was dismayed to find the problem still plagued this grand bit of British TV. I returned it for the second time and decided some things are best left to memory. Tis a shame indeed.
2,"Nice costumes, sluggish adaptation","I've only watched the first two episodes of this series, but I have to say I am disappointed. The pace drags, and Geraldine McEwen and Nigel Hawthorne are so mannered as to be almost unwatchable. However, perhaps it will pick up as it goes along and the actors get into their roles, as another reviewer wrote. Geraldine McEwen certainly looks the part, very Erte, with a new outfit for almost every scene, and Rye is a lovely back-drop, but being shot on video gives it that very 'made for television' quality.If you are tossing up whether to watch the series or read the books, then please read the books!"
4,If you love Mapp & Lucia a must see!!!!!,"This video collection is a ""dead on"" dramatization of the books. Wonderfully acurate, and a pleasure to watch!!! Highly recommend."
5,Mapp & Lucia Series 1,"What to say? What a wonderful series, as only the English can do! Eccentric old ladies, Geraldine McEwan and Prunella Scales, and Nigel Hawthorne (not an old lady, but eccentric anyway.) All trying, and do, upstage one another. Bitchy, yes! Funny, yes! Wonderful costumes, situations and locales, definitely 1930s. If you like eccentric English, this is for you."
4,A delightful step into a small English world,"E.F. Benson's _Lucia_ novels are brought to life in a beautifully photographed series which features the talents of some terrific actors. Scales, McEwan, and Hawthorne are outstanding in portraying the petty bickering that propels small town society. The costumes of the time period (especially those worn by Lucia) are magnificent; the breezy humor and devilish plotting will delight the viewer."
3,"Great potential, poor reliability","Nice phone - plenty to like. Used it for a couple of years.But it dropped calls constantly - if you were on the phone for more than a few minutes, you could count on the handset dropping the link to the base, and then trying to reconnect, by which time your call was gone. Maybe this was something in my environment, but neither my previous phone (a v-tech with issues of its own) nor my subsequent phone (a very steady panasonic) have had this problem.And after about a year, the keypad buttons started to deteriorate, so you could no longer confidently dial - you had to force each button and make sure it registered. And this was with very light use. That's poor design or poor quality - something like this should work reliably for much longer in light use. Twice burned by v-tech, I'm now using a different brand."
2,"Nice Features, short battery life","I just got back from returning this phone. I purchased it at the local BJ's for $42, it wasn't worth that. The person I was talking to sounded like they were in a hole and the battery didn't last long at all, probably because of the photo storage and other features. I liked the concept of downloading songs and pictures to attach to callers, but I need it to work well first."
2,Insipid,"Don 't disappoint Dad. Please, let's pull the plug, finally and forever and for good, on books like this. Just because one is a ""celebrity"" or expert in one field doesn't mean they have much of value to say about a subject, something this book proves over and over again with thoroughly unmemorable passages written by the most annoying talking heads one can imagine. Most essays reveal more ignorance than real insight, and the treacly predominates. Interesting as a document of why people should never write about a subject outside of their area of expertise, but otherwise one of the more forgettable compilations of writing on baseball ever put together."
2,Not so great...,Book was not what I expected. Be prepared to do all the work. This book works if you are s creative/grafter parent. It's not a ready to use package. I will be returning it
2,Disturbing; odd,"Annie DunnePerhaps I didn't read the reviews thouroughly enough, but not one reviewer mentioned something which ruined the whole book for me: a very disturbing scene, sexual in nature, between the two children, aged four and six, which I found so jarring that I merely skimmed the book to the end and deleted it.I am not describing the scene, in hopes that my review won't itself be deleted, but would like to warn others, as I would have appreciated being warned. This was most definitely not for me. While the author seems to really nail characterization, I found few enough to like that would compel me to care what happens to them. This was a very, very odd book."
5,An unlikely heroine,"Annie Dunne is set on a small farm in Wicklaw Ireland around 1959, in a rural Ireland that no longer exists. It's here we find the book's narrator, a slight and remarkable spinster and her spinster cousin Sarah, anticipating the arrival of her young nephew and niece. With poetic, emotive, bewitching language, Sebastian Barry brings us into Annie's small limed cottage, her hen yard, her life. We're there in the shadows, as she explains the proper gesture for drawing rain water, we are there in the dairy, watching, as she and Sarah perform the ageless sorcery of making butter. We suffer her slights, her spites, her quick tongue and temper, the aches of her toil but mostly we experience her frugal pleasures and the fierce joy and love she feels for her family. The Washington Post calls this novel a `deliciously poetic book'. It is one of the best written book I've read in a very long time. If you read this book and remain unmoved by it you have my pity."
5,Annie Dunn,Outstanding example of literature which is quite representative of the wotk of thi superb Irish author.
3,Heart of RO,"I think this book could be considered as a basis for the engineers and the researchers, who are so much involved in RO-desalination. Moreover, it will help the operators of the RO plants to understand the concept of the RO process."
2,Not so tasty,"This is a very simple cookbook that is indeed low fat cooking. It is also low in taste. There were a couple of dishes that I will use in my menus from now on. But to be honest I did not feel this was worth the money. Most of the recipes are very easy and simple but do not have much flavor. In my opinion, not enough spice or herbs used in the recipes."
4,A Handy Book for Healthy Singles and Couples,"Cooking healthy meals for two is my goal each day and Eleanor's book helps me do that with confidence. While I miss seeing color photographs, I highly appreciate the simplicity of the recipes, the dietary information at the bottom of each page and especially Eleanor's own notes and serving ideas after every recipe. The Hungarian Goulash is one of my favorites, so far. Can't wait to try the Gingerbread Delight and the Curried Vegetable Medley.The recipes are easy, fun, nutritious and tasty. I highly recommend this book to those who are cooking for one and who tend to neglect their dietary needs.Patricia L. Fry...."
3,Healthy?,"If you consider hydrogenated oils (Margerine-Butter buds), and canned foods that are in some of the recipes healthy. Also Microwave cooking? This book should be called 30 minute meals."
2,"Wrong version, book has been updated since this version","This book has a lot of information, however it is outdated due to many recent occurrences of terroism that has happened since this book dated back in 1996. Bruce Hoffman is a excellent author, please get the updated version, 2006."
3,Bought it for a college class,"This was a book that I ordered for a college class. As I recall, the book had some out dated information that caused some issues in the class. I am a military intelligence officer and I can recall addressing several inaccuracies with the professor. If you are buying this as a college text book, it will provide some basic information and historical accounts but it is not completely up to date."
3,I'm Skeptical,"I read through the book hoping to find solutions to my changing skin problems as I approach 50. There were some good pointers, but I had bad results with one of the home-made face lotions. I broke out the next day, so I was gun shy about using any more. While there are some good, common-sense ideas, I think I will stick to over-the-counter products. The home-made products tend to get a little pricey too."
1,Don't do it,"These are terrible tapes. They are not professionally filmed. The instructors are not professionals either. The whole instructions for a dance is about 2 minutes. You watch them dance the steps, facing you which doesn't work very well, and then they turn on the music and they dance until the song is over. That's it."
5,Unbelievable,"I took the Hale Clinic course with Alexander Stalmatsky, and after 30+ years of asthma I am at the very least symptom free. You wouldnt believe the other health benefits from learning to breath less unless you experience them first hand. The one thing I will say is that it takes effort and time to unlearn your current breathing patterns. So don't expect it to be easy or fast. You need to give it months.The key to the approach is practicing shallow breathing interspersed with different types of pauses. While I think everyone would benefit from taking a course or consulting with a professional, some may be able to learn it just by reading this book. Though I would recommend connecting with others doing it, for support and help with the nuances. There are online support groups on yahoo."
3,Not yet sold,"Only scientific test of this system I could find is at www.mja.com.au/public/issues/contents.html. Click 7/21 Dec 1998, go to Alternative Medicene,click Buteyko Breathing Techniques in Asthma. Their tests showed it did not increase breathing capacity. Suggest you read the report for yourself.I have found helpful Paul Sorvino's book ""How to be a former asthmatic."" Totally different approach. Perhaps one of the keys is for asthmatics to learn they can control their breathing, whatever method they use."
4,Breathing Free,"Since I was diagonised with asthma, I' ve been reading this book, using the suggestions and breathing excercises which have been helpful. I am a gardener and love to be outdoors so having a resource to go to when I'm having any problems has been important. Giving up exercising or outdoor actives was not an option for me. I would recommend this book for anyone with breathing problems."
2,Comparison to Asthma Free naturally,"I read Teresa Hales book a number of years ago and found the principles easy to follow. However, I have recently read another book called Asthma Free Naturally which is written by an asthmatic and can so readily identify with the symptoms. I felt that I knew this person as the condition he was describing was so me. The book Asthma Free naturally is far easier to read, understand and apply. The author of this book is a trained Buteyko practitioner and this is evident from the read. Teresa Hale is not a qualified practitioner and so is writing based on someones elses experiences. While Teresa Hales book is worth reading, Asthma Free naturally by Patrick McKeown is essential reading for all asthmatics."
2,"Fair Introduction, but reads like a sales pamphlet","This book is a skimpy introduction to the Buteyko method, which seems to work. While the Buteyko method is very good, this book is deliberately vague about the details of the actual exercises. Hale spends chapter after chapter describing all the illnesses that the Breath Connection method will cure, but leaves many key questions about the method unanswered. Why do you take your pulse? How exactly do you breath shallowly? Do you use your diaphragm? Do you count? If not, how are you sure that you are doing it right?Hale is plainly drumming up business for her clinic, so if there are more complete books on Buteyko elsewhere, I would strongly recommend going there."
4,if you want to take control of your asthma without medication,"This book has allowed me to get off of all medication. The concepts are deceptively simple and laid out so they are very easy to follow, cookbook style.It is so simple stupid. But ten days later, after a lifetime of perpetual medication, asthma and allergies, I am free from taking all medication, and yesterday I ran for 15 minutes with no asthma.If this sounds appealing, read the book. What do you have to lose?"
1,Harmful Advice,"This book encourages people to sleep as little as possible, use an inhaler only when they can not breathe, tape a child's mouth at night to force him/her to breathe through the nose, throw away peak flow meters, and put babies to sleep on their tummies-all harmful advice that could have serious, even fatal, consequences.For a healthy, sensible approach to asthma control, read ""Asthma-Relax, You're Not Going To Die""."
1,"Oh, please!","I got tired of reading the chitty-chat and self promotion and put it down. I guess there is some useful information provided, but I got tired of looking for it."
3,"great ambiance, ok game.","The scary feeling is well done, especially the sound, the footsteps behind you when no one is really there...well done. The gameplay is good, but repetitive. Mostly the same bad guys, different building."
1,"Game is great, but DOES NOT WORK WELL ON PC.","I have the XBOX version of this game and it is really good, actually. I figured the PC version would be too, and I prefer to have the PC version of any game. However, I bought the PC version only to find out that it becomes extremely unplayable after playing the game for about 5 minutes. The game drops in FPS to under 30 and begins stuttering all over the place. Look this issue up on the internet and you will see that: 1. Many (if not all) users on the PC have this same issue. 2. The company selling the game never patched it! There is absolutely NO FIX for this issue. Honestly, Amazon should NOT be selling a product like this, as it will just create a negative image for them. Take it off the shelve Amazon, it's a lemon."
2,not the best shooter,I was a little let down with this fps. Not enough action for me. Game was a little slow.
4,I always enjoy a Luanne Rice book,"Over the last year Luanne Rice has become a favorite author of mine. I'll admit that the more I read of hers, I do wish for a bit more originality, going back to her earlier books, that might not have gotten a lot of acclaim, but they sure gained me as a reader. Maybe it's this way with most writers, after you've read about 10 of their books...I don't know. Either way, this still was a good book with a great plot- the bit of mystery was a little unique for Rice- maybe she's realizing her faithful readers need a bit of variety? Over-all, I recommend this book to faithful fans and those who have yet to try a story by Rice. The books always have a touch of magic."
4,Enjoyed this book.,"Had never read anything by this author, and picked it up just on the title and cover summary. But I must admit that I enjoyed this story. This is a good beach read or lazy day read. The story was compelling and well-rounded, and there was a good mystery drawn into the plot. I really felt I got to know the characters and their surroundings as well. Luanne Rice gives you just enough of everything. A light but pleasant read. Enjoy."
3,My first!,"This is my first book by this author, and although it won't be the last, I wish there had been more depth and detail to this book. At times it seemed unbelievable some of the things the FBI and police would do, but hey what do I have to say? I am just along for the ride. I do agree Bay and Danny were slightly boring and I enjoyed Tara more. I skimmed over quite a few pages but none the less I did enjoy reading it!"
3,"Sort of Sequal to ""Firefly Beach""","It really helps to have read Luanne Rice's previous novel ""Firefly Beach"" .... as the character of Augusta Renwick, from that novel, is featured extensively, here, in ""Perfect Summer"".Many of the Luanne Rice novels have characters that reappear, since Rice has set her last 7 novels in the same seaside Connecticut town.I like the relationship between best friends Bay McCabe and Tara O'Toole (the Irish Sisters) here. I disliked the over-used theme of a woman finding out that her husband had a secret life.The whole novel is about trying to uncover what happened to Bay McCabe's missing husband. But, this theme has been so over-used in, say, Barbara Delinsky's ""A Woman Betrayed"" to Anita Shreve's ""Pilot's Wife"".Still, Luanne Rice is a very evocative writer who writes great characters who become your friends, and a wonderful setting, even if you hate the plot."
5,Exciting and riveting!,"Well, I normally adore Luanne Rice and Kristin Hannah, but I haven't read all of Luanne Rice's books so I'm not familiar with the concept that her last couple of books have taken place in the same town.Anyway, I absolutely loved this book. It blended mystery, love, friendship, and betrayal so well. I was stunned.However, I had really wanted Mrs. Rice to explore Sean McCabe a bit more. The letter did add a nice touch though. I also wanted to see a bit more from the developing relationship between Tara and the FBI agent. I actually liked them better than Bay and Danny. In truth, Bay and Danny were a bit boring. I didn't really sense the chemistry or the depth of their relationship. It could have been built up a bit more.But I loved how Mrs. Rice built up the mystery until the end and explained Sean's perspective a bit, because Sean really captivated me more.I give this book a 5, because it was just plain phenomenal."
2,Forgettable,"If you want to read a good Luanne Rice book, go way back to her earlier works, like Crazy in Love. This was written before Ms. Rice began wallowing in sentimentality and predictability ala Danielle Steele for the sake of mass marketing."
3,Perfect Summer?,"This summer written about was obviously NOT the perfect summer, anything that could go wrong did. I have read many of Luanne Rice's books, so there must be something I like about the stories. I use the public library and buy very few books, thankfully so if I pick a bummer it's no big deal. I found myself skimming over pages and pages at a time cause they were just too wordy and filled up with unnecessary descriptions and thoughts. One reviewer said the characters were so realistic, but I disagree. In reality would one gardening job provide enough income for a family of 4? I also found the exchanges between the FBI agent and Bay to be a stretch.But all's well that ends well. Why would the perps find it best to get rid of the witness rather than the van, since that was all the traumatized girl saw? And then attempt it so clumsily?"
3,not bad,"Not a bad product if you just use Flashes like Speedlite. If u are gonna get monolights, wont be enought!"
5,Exellent,"I highly reccomend this site for quailty and speed.I ordered this Adorama Pro 10' Air Cushioned Chrome Lightstand for my son as a Christmas gift.He was pleasantly surprised at the good taste his mom had in ordering this fine product.I intend do more ordering from this site.I was pleased with the quick delivery and the followup from this site.Keep up the good work.Jean Lucas Mt. Pulaski, Il."
4,Just fine,"I've got no complaints. The thing has (thankfully) never been put to the test. However, it's solid and locks and unlocks very easily. Hasn't jammed once. Good enough for me.One complaint on the seller's part though: The product describe wasn't the exact product shipped. It was yellow, it was a wheel lock. It was not however a ""Dr. Hook"" lock. It was a no-name brand lock labeled ""WHEEL LOCK"". Again, it's a fine product, especially for the price. But it's somewhat shady to receive a different brand than what's listed."
4,A very interesting read,"I seem to be running on Jew/Holocaust steam lately... I've been reading such books only...I don't know what to write of this book. This is such a famous book, that I think any review will not do it justice.Reading this book, I cannot stop questioning myself: If I lived during those times, what would I do? If I were a Jew, what would I do? If I were German, what would I do?There are many memorable Schindler quotes, and I think that they all ring some truth. ""When you know people, you have to treat them like people."" And the most touching, is his speech.A very interesting individual."

4,An excellent introduction to the early church Fathers,"As a current student of the authour, I find this book to be replete with wonderful readings of the stories of the early Christians and their thoughts of the time. From orthodox readings by Justin Martyr to questionable documents as The Gospel of Thomas, the reader will find a great source of information.The book is best done in a class setting, and even tells you how to write a historiographical essay. If you have an interest in church history, get this book!"
2,Not very good,"This book wasn't very good. A third grader could have written better than that. It isn't even scarey at all, it's too easy to read, and the ending is maddening because there are so many different endings."
2,Could have been better,Documenting the attitudes towards the Indians in the reservations and their attitudes -good. Storyline- bad- meandered all over the place as if the writer couldn't decide on the fate of her characters.
4,Perma Red review by Debra Earling,This book is about a young woman who does everything against all odds. She strives to be an original. It taked place on the flathead reservation in a Native tribe. She is opinionated and very independent. Her opinionated mouth often gets into trouble and makes her go through many journeys throughout the book. Many different men in the tribe ask for her hand in marraige but she always refuses... each man who askes is more dangerous then the one before.
3,"amazing writing, decent story","Before the last 50 pages of this book, I was very disappointed. While all of it is beautifully written, a large portion of the story drags. This is something I would have understood and even appreciated if I felt I were learning about the characters' culture in the meantime, but I didn't. I began to resent the main character as if she were an autobiographer wasting my time with a narrative that wouldn't interest anyone as much as it did herself.That being said, the story becomes much more alive, as far as action as well as geniune, important emotion near the end, and my impression of Louise grew favorably with it. But that didn't erase the effort I'd had to put forth to get though the majoity of the book.Overall, I wish that either the storyline had been faster paced or that the downtime had been used more effectively, helping me relate to the characters and their heritage."
1,Drowning in metaphors,"This book could be used in a college course as an anthology of metaphors. They finally started to irritate me. About half way through, I found myself skipping paragraphs, then pages, then chapters and finally gave up and read the end. It was a sad, depressing tale that just seemed to go around and around in circles. Maybe that's what the author was aiming for."
2,Very dissappointed,"I needed a remote with an extended sleep timer. This model specified that. The only key that doesnt seem to work is the ""sleep timer"" button. Now I'm stuck with another remote control I will never use."
3,It's ok,"Nothing special here. If you need a replacement remote, it's ok. If you need it to do anything fancy, look elsewhere."
5,Paddling Eastern North Carolina with Paul Ferguson,"This book is essential if you enjoy paddling the rivers and creeks of Eastern North Carolina. It not only gives you all the access points, but the distance between them as well. It is very handy when exploring a new paddle trail or trying to locate an access."
1,Cheap Junk,"I purchased this thermostatic controler with the hopes of overiding a quirky stock system. Installation was pretty easy and unit worked as decsribed when intially installed. The very next day after a few cycles of turning itself on and off, the controller part of thhis unit melted. The wires burned completely through the insulation rendering it useless. I would recommend staying away from this product, as it seems cheaply made and unreliable."
1,Horrible customer service,"I installed the 3647 along with a set of 3800 dual fans. Everything worked well for about 2 weeks. Then it rained. An hour of driving in the rain and the relay started making noises and both fans stopped. So I tried to contact Hayden. They require your First Name, Last Name, Title, Company, Site, Address, City, State/Province, Zip/Postal Code, Country, Phone Number, Fax Number, Email Address before you can even submit an email to them and then they don't answer it. If you try to use their online tech support they don't reply. In short the product broke the first time it rained and Hayden provided no support. I will now have to remove the fans and relay, install the old fan and fan clutch, return the relay, wait until the relay comes in, remove the mechanical fan and fan clutch, rewire the relay and fans, install the electric fans. I'm not a happy camper at all."
1,Multiple product failures,Have had 2 of these fail in a month. First was purchased from amazon and worked perfectly for about a week until it failed in the off setting. Fan would not come on no matter the temperature. Replaced it at my local parts store and all was well for 3 weeks. The new one has now failed stuck in run mode so now the fan runs all the time. Don't waste your money guys
5,Hayden 3647 Cooling Fan Control,"Worked great, description matches what the unit does. Easy to install and replaced a faulty FlexLite unit. The only thing missing is the ability to have a manual switch to turn the unit on. I got around this by installing a second relay that bypasses this automatic unit."
1,No surprise here. More of the same.,Had one of these products on my truck for 10 years. When it finally failed I thought I was going with a product with a good track record. Not the case. Bought another one and it lasted about 13 to 14 months. My guess is the Chinese are making them for Hayden now. Don't waste your money on these. It may last and it may not. Fortunately when this last one failed it did so in the shop and I didn't get stranded out on the road. Save your money and look for a reliable product. This one is not reliable.
3,Hayden thermostat,"Worked for a while. Now fan is on when key is on. Blah, blah, blah blah, blah.......just just wasting space to get to submit."
1,Fan control not working properly,"To who it may concern,I ordered the hayden 3647 adjustable thermo fan control, works ok but will not turn fan on when a/c is turned on. everything else works ok.Sincerely,Clyde Richmond"
3,Weak relay,Received the part promptly and was a breeze to install. Worked greart for about a week but then it started to act up. Sometimes it was on when it did not need to be and then wouldn't cut off. I replaced the relay and all is well. Other than the weak relay I would buy again.
1,Worked fine... for a while,"Lasted about 2 months, then died, nearly killing my engine when it overheated. Avoid this product at all costs, there are better units out there, maybe a bit more cash but worth every penny."
1,HAYDEN 3647 FAN CONTROL,BOUGHT FAN CONTROL EARLIER GOT IT INSTALLED WORKED FINE FOR TWO WEEKS THEN FAILED TO TURN FAN ON CUT ORANGE WIRE AND RAN TO 12 VOLTS TO GET HOME
5,for my truck,this is a nice set up and workes well the only thing that sucked was i was missing green cover for the light so all i got is the red one and $5 for a replament it is stay red
3,Good in parts,"Terry Jones was fine in Monty Python, but I'm afraid his reading leaves something to be desired.He has trouble with his 'r's, with detract from the story.He puts commendable energy into his reading.Tolkien's translation is very lively, but after a while I began to tire of his copious alliterations."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Slightly more interesting piece of output, due to the theme being theold Green Knight story. That tale is usually quite entertaining, and isin this version, as well. The other piece is eminently forgettable,however. I suppose you would say that it is for Tolkien completistsonly."
3,A nice surprise,"This is what I was expecting going into ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight"": A boring tale about knights of the roundtable, and 86 pages of knights doing knight stuff. Instead, I got a surprising fable of temptation and perfection. Graphic imagery is used throughout, and the first few pages are kind of nutty. However, it becomes a nice feel-good story with an important moral at the end."
4,Fat burner!,I swear I've lost a few pounds since drinking this regularly with the Diet Partner for appetite.
4,homegrown techno,"this is actually one of the three SF discs i own (though one is just a reissue w/ a few prev. unreleased tracks). this is music to journey to. the epitome of hardcore breakbeat/d-n-b...it's crisp, tight production delivered at a unrelenting pace. even though their album was released on some obscure canadian label, the SpeedFreeks actually hail from knoxville, tn. believe it or not, knoxville is currently sporting several names to watch:lemon drop kid, slavestate, and dj slink (principal song-writer & producer for SF)-check it out-you'll be glad you did."
5,Love the Ring,I just get my ring in the mail today in opened the box. I love this ring what more can i!!!!!
5,Segre:Amatter of degrees,"I was interested in both the topic and the author. The book is excellent, both an entertaining reading for people interested in the relationahip of ScieNce and history and also for teaching purposes."
3,Science for the curious,This book is a fantastic read for any of us who has gone through their science courses in school and wondered if there is more to science than the cut and dry information they got from their BORING(!!!!)textbooks.Who would have ever thought that such a prestigious family of physicists who can pride themselves of a Nobel prize trace back to a enterprising grand-father who built a paper mill on top of Roman temple in Italy?Science is indeed a human story.
2,"2 stars for usefulness, 4 stars for interesting tidbits","I read this book after reading John Gribbin's ""Deep Simplicity"" and ""Ice Age"". If I hadn't read Gribbin's books I would not have been able to put some of Segre's political bias into context, and filter the good information from the scientific facts. Gribbin writes in a much clearer style and without the blantant political overtones."
4,A strong debut by Julianna Smith.,"I enjoyed ""Dream Catcher"" very much. It was an interesting twist to the ""standard"" psychic mythos. And paranormal attributes aside, it also develops into a nerve-wracking kidnapping thriller. Definitely recommended!"
2,Decception,"I have nothing bad to say about the dress. It is beautiful and the details are stunning. My concern was the size. I ordered the dress for my baby girl who is just 3 months old, so I ordered the small size (0 to 6 months). The dress is way too small and did not fit my baby. I am wondering what it could be if the baby was six months old... I will have to return it. However the dress is beautiful, just be careful when you select the size."
4,Swinging without Django,"This is another great SAGA JAZZ release. I am not sure if this material is available elsewhere, but it is a nice package.It is both very interesting, and very entertaining. It highlights Mr. Grappelli's evolving style. Excellent liner notes. If you like Hot club music, you should enjoy this."
3,More Information,"Nice piece, but you need more information if you want to purchase it. It measures approximately 5 inches in diameter and 5 1/4"" tall. Also, the shipping costs are less if you purchase directly off the manufacturer's web site (the jar cost was the same).Do not refrigerate the grease while it is still hot - could cause this piece to crack."
2,Opening to the Divine by MANY PATHS!,"The book is ok if you believe in the power with in and that there are no angels, wayshowers, saints, Mary Mother, Budda, etc that can help you in this life. If you believe that God's mind cannot be changed then this book will help you in your space of ""knowing""..."
5,Must be seen,"I wish that every impotent politician and do gooder who screamed, in their ignorance, 'One MAn One Vote' in the 70's could see the devastation wrought by the very man they encouraged into power.This film displays the dignity and courage of a farming family who dared to stand against the injustice and corruption of a government that has brought a beautiful, prosperous country to its knees. Greed and power has marked Mugabe's reign. He will die soon and behind him is a legacy of destruction, violence and genocide....Yet the world looks on and does nothing.Mike Campbell and his family dared to take Mugabe on. They refused to hand over their legally owned land to one of Mugabe's henchmen. They went to an international court and won....but at what a price. View this DVD if you have the courage. Then I challenge you to do something worthwhile to bring change in Zimbabwe."
3,Interesting but Biased,"There is much truth in this documentary. However, it is more biased and one-sided. Yes, Mugabe is a dictator and abuses his power and he needs to be overthrown. However, white Rhodesian leaders treated black Africans far worse.The farmer in this documentary bought his land after Mugabe took power and thus claims he has a legitimate claim to his land. This is equivalent to someone buying loot plundered from the Nazis and claiming that he legitimately purchased it and thus he legally owns it.Buying stolen property doesn't make it yours. It merely makes you an accomplice in a crime. Zimbabwe was stolen from native Africans and they deserve compensation."
3,"Better, but no legacy","Lovely, simple, classy, touching...like Laura, but not nearly enough to catch her essence. Beats the kort bio by miles. The little vignettes are perfect, though skimpy. Thanx to Vivino and Sebastian...two moving, insightful tidbits. The back cover says she died at 40...wrong!...it was 49...and this is important. Laura was into the details and this should not have been missed.New cd out this Tuesday...""Spread your wings and fly..."" I can't wait!"
1,What a let down!!,"I got my hammock stand very quickly, and with great anticipation I set it up in my backyard. I laid on it for a short while and then decided to come back to it a bit later. When I returned to relax, the metal 'ripped' and I found myself sitting on the ground. I have been awaiting a return label to ship it back to the company for at least a month...maybe more. So now I have to find a box big enough in which to packup a hammock stand!!! Overall, I am not impressed with this stand or the company from which I got it!"
5,Wobots Christmas,WOW. I was shocked at how well written this movie was. The storyline was very nice. It told the reason for Christmas in such a simple way for young children to start to grasp why we have Christmas. I would say it is a must for your young childs dvd library.
5,Absolutely stunning!,"When I saw this, I just had to purchase it. The figurine reminds me so much of my daughter-in-law and our granddaughter. When it arrived, I was not disappointed. It was just as I had hoped. I am a great Llardo lover and this Nao brand is lovely."
4,Superb,I bought this book because of a superb review in the August issue of Elle Magazine comparing all the various diets out there for my husband who suffers from depression. This has been very helpful though I would say that the quiz could be more thorough and explanatory in its results
4,Great Ideas!,"This book may be a great way to ""fix"" things. I have a hard enough time dieting, so honestly, I don't know how I could change all my eating habits to accomodate. I was very desperate to find a ""way out"" of depression when I bought this book. I believe it could help those that have a strong will to be disciplined. It makes sense! The quiz in the front of the book is pretty accurate. If you are willing and don't want to be medicated or try something other than medication, definitely give it a try!"
2,A little dated!,Material is dated! Teachers do experience the samefrustrations. I guess when I purcahsed the productI didn't realize that it was already ten years + old.
1,The first Year,"Not what I expected. The video runs very slow, which makes it difficult to watch for an extended period of time."
3,OK Book,"This was one of the first C++ book after an intro book. I found it a pretty good at discussing many of the easier concepts of C++. I was disapointed when std::sring and vector were not discussed. I found some dynamic arry that seemed to work. Some of the topics are useful and some are confusing. It is a pretty decent book for the intro programmer, the book is readable and many of the topics are broken into managable bits. It is not so good in trying to understand any intermediate programming or any useful guild for style and design."
1,"Unworkable code, no support from either company or author","Book looked very promising, however, not a single program involving strings works, author forgets to include crucial bit of instructions (header files anyone?). The book claims to have all the code on the web at the McMillan site, this is an outright lie, there is only a y2k information there. Repeated attempts to contact the publisher or the author have come to nothing. Do not buy this book, unless some serious changes are made."
3,Decent Introduction for nonprogrammer...,"This was a decent book.... however the quality was hindered by major typographical errors, and relatively few examples. It also had the potential to be a great reference book for those with a little more experience, but the lack of detail (and marginal index) hinders it in that area. Overall, the book does a decent job of reaching the intended audience, but there must be better works out there."
4,A sweeet book for begginners and intermediates,"Not bad at all. Some of the explenations are thrown right at you, but dont worry, everythings later explained. A thorough job, and definately worth the money you pay for it. Id suggest this book to anyone just kicking off in the C++ environment."
1,Not worth the time or money.,"I bought this based on reviews... and frankly, it's terrible. I watched Kimmel on CNBC after buying it, and if I had seen him first, I wouldn't have bothered. There are hundreds of better books on this topic... Kimmel is constantly pushing buy buy buy... probably because he gets commissions from his customers whether they make or lose money. Awful awful advice."
2,Both films are great but the DVD is not perfect,"I got this DVD today and the first reason was CLEOPATRA WONG why I ordered the DVD.The film CLEOPATRA WONG is only in fullframe but it's a Widescreen film. You can see it because the credits are in Widescreen. A Widescreen-Action-Movie in Fullscreen is something what no fan needed.The other film THE ONE ARMED EXECUTIONER is in very good anamorphic 2.35:1 Widescreen.Because one movie of this DVD is very good I gave 2 stars.A good bonus, too are the available englisch Subtitles, so handicaped people can see the films, too."
5,James Coplien has outdone himself,"I've read quite a few of Jim's works over the years, and he has never failed to impress me. This book should be required reading for any project manager!"
5,A Man Rides Through,"Received timely and in good condition. This book is the sequel to The Mirror of Her Dreams, which leaves the ending in doubt until the next book: A Man Rides Through. Very suspenseful and imaginative. Couldn't wait to see what would happen next."
2,Misogynistic with purient obsession with character's nipples,"As a two book series this was just about OK. I will not read them again; unlike the Thomas Covenant novels. These books chart the continuation of Mr Donaldson's downward spiral into misogyny which so far has reached is high point with Morn in the Gap novels. I'm of course, sliding right by all the uses of 'celerity' and 'exigency', but his obsession with Terisa's ""aching nipples"" on just about every page is a little disconcerting."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Mirror battles.A somewhat tedious end to what at least is only a duology, as the good guys and bad guys at least from the point of our protagonist run around with their plotting and killing.At least until they actually come to grips, anyway. Certainly not the equal, storywise, of the other series he has produced."
2,Too much--not enough,"Mirror of Her Dreams/A Man Rides Through-these should have been condensed into one book. I was disappointed in the love story. After Teresa and Geraden's long, laborious ""courtship"" the romance consummated with not much more than a gleam in Geraden's eye-well into the second book. Eremes, the villain, gave and got more than that! Could we not have been treated to a little passion between the hero and heroine?As to the story-the concept was amazing, and complicated, as the author seemed only too well aware as he practically stood on his head to get out of the corners he'd written himself into. Too bad, too. Donaldson writes very well. Condensed, edited, and with the romance beefed up, this book could have been big fun-the stuff great movies are made from."
3,Too slow,The Mirror of Her Dreams captivated me but this sequel takes to long to move the story along. Individual chapters/ pages are beautifullly written. The worlds are expertly created and described but the story is methodical in places.
3,"Good, far from best...","Donaldson is a master - both the Covenant and Gap series show this. The Mordant series is only fair compared to them. It simply does not have the depth or scope to compare with the longer series , and it seems that towards the end Donaldson himself grew tired of the characters. It is a fantastic story, well written with a moving plot. It's simply that after finishing both the Covenant and Gap series, for days, even weeks later I was still blown away, whereas after the Mordant series all I could think was ""That was good."" Anyway, Donaldson fans won't be disappointed, but don't expect the same caliber of his longer works."
5,Outstanding Delivery and just what is needed,"The Mrs. has worn this for years and it's fragrance lasts throughout the day. Shipping on this item was outstanding and we were amazed how fast, this order, arrived."
5,yastis,"It makes her happy, hence its what I like, to think otherwise is a waste of thought. This review is simple....easy....and honest."
5,Ysatis -- a classic,"This was purchased at the request of my mother. She had not been able to find it locally. She loves the scent and that it is not overpowering. I find it very pleasing as I am overly sensitive to perfumes and rarely use colonge myself. It's definitly a personal type of scent for a mature woman, but it's not great-grandmother's Essence of Roses."
5,My favorite fragrance of all time!,I love this fragrance and was unable to purchase the product in department stores. I was excited to find it available on line.
3,Didn't work,"Mine didn't work, but for the price, it wasn't worth the hassle of trying to send it back. I would assume I just got a faulty product, but I don't need the remote enough to risk trying again."
1,HP remote for media center,"I got the remote in the mail, put the battery in, nothing. So I thought maybe tge battery is old and out of energy. So I put in another similar battery I got from my motherboard. Nothing. its a waste of my money. Doesnt work on my DV7. I ain't gonna waste my time sending it back."
4,An excellent book on Civil War Leadership,"This is one of the best books I read on the Civil War in 1997. Offers an overview of the battles and the tactics employed by both sides in all theatres of the War. The sections on George H. Thomas, John B. Gordon and Francis C. Barlow were excellent and offered an insight to these great men, why they fought and how they fought. I would recommend this book to anybody who enjoys a good read on the U.S. Civil War."
5,What a Life!,"This is a grand story of a B-17 Flying Fortress in the 8th Air Corps early days bombing France and Germany in WW II. More than that, it is the autobiography of one of the most interesting men I have ever encountered. The MEMPHIS BELLE was one of the first planes and crews to complete 25 missions and come home to thank Americans for their home front efforts."
4,Juvenile Retelling of Sexual Adventures,"I enjoyed this book, despite the constant, repetitious, detailed recounting of his sexual experiences, and his belief that God was exhibiting special interest in him."
5,Best First Person Account of the Air War over Germany in WWII,"This is a very well written book, I could not stop reading it. I have always been interested in the air war over Germany in WWII, and this account by Robert Morgan was very detailed and also how he lived his life before and after the war is a remarkable story. I highly recommed this book, and check out the U.S. Air Force website as to the progress of the complete restoration of the ""Memphis Belle"".It was returned to the Air Force as Government Property from the city of Memphisabout 10 years ago. I hope you enjoy the read and pictures as much as I did.Yesterday, September 1 in 1939 was the 72nd anniversary of the beginning of WWII.Rob"
1,Good idea but poor quality at a high price!,"The idea of having a collar to train and contain your dog is a good one. I have owned 4 of the smart collars over a two year period now, and am very disappointed with the performance. On two dogs which do not require much of any training, the batteries only last a couple of days. I have watched and it is not because the dogs are constantly testing the fence. This is just a poor product masquerading as a good one at a high sticker price. Beware! You are not getting a good product because you are paying a premium price. Shame on Innotek!"
3,Long Term Expense isn't worth it,"We've used this Innotek 5100 system for two years and are retiring it for something better, primarily for one reason: battery life on the collars. Some collars lasted a full year while others died in only four months. After having purchased four replacement collars (at over $100 each) we're shifting to something that lets us replace the batteries. We'd also like a collar that allows for adjusting the shock individually as each of our german shepherds reacts differently to the fence, even with their neck shaved.We made the Innotek system work (most of the time), but having paid the equivalent of the original purchase price in replacement collars, we're shifting to something that has a better long term cost. At least the buried wire from Innotek works on the new system, so it wasn't a complete loss."
4,Great product,I bought this fencer after having problems with other brands. It was by far superior to the other two I had purchases. I love that this one beeps to warn the dog before administering a shock. Helped my dog learn in no time! The only reason I docked a star was the training remote has a very limited range.
2,Great Product Horrible Customer Service,"I recieved the product and it worked great! Unfortunately, I lost the remote control and Innotek would not sell me a new one. Innotek told me that I would have to buy the whole system again. Now would sony or panasonic make me buy a new TV if i lost my remote. I am extremely upset and disheartened by this company. I will never to business with Innotek again."
1,collar lasted just over 1 year- recommend getting another model with a replaceable rechargable battery,"My collar lasted just over 1 year- I recommend getting different model with a replaceable rechargable battery in the collar. Since I am just out of warranty, I will be charged for this replacement collar. Look at a different company please- and possibly find a local company that installs this system- it is A LOT OF WORK. My collar started sounding off & short circuiting, possibly shocking my dog for no reason. This unit has a DEFECTIVE collar, so please be careful with this package if you purchase it. I completely understand the out of warranty issue, but this is one horrible design flaw, and Innotek should not be allowed to get away with selling this product."
2,Beware if you have a small dog,"For the first couple months, we only used the collar and the remote control - no fence. It worked quite well then, but we only needed to use levels 1 - 3 on the remote to correct the dog. Level 3 would make him jump pretty good, so we used it very sparingly.When we finally buried the wire and started testing, we found the lowest setting the fence allows is equivalent to about a level 7 on the remote (estimate) which was far higher than he had ever experienced. The first and only time the dog encountered this level during his training was a horrible experience that would've put him in therapy if he was a person. It is now 4 months later, and I sometimes have to get my wife to let him outside because he is still occasionally afraid to go out when I'm around.Now the remote doesn't work anymore, and I have no idea why.My dog is now weird, and in part I blame Innotek."
1,Defective product - not worth the price,"I received this product and the collar wouldn't charge. I contacted the manufacturer for a replacement but they are out of stock and won't be able to send a replacement for at least 14 days. This system cost more than others and I expected the quality would be higher. For the price, this is completely unacceptable. I would not recommend purchasing this item."
1,Terrible quality!,"This fencing system is a horrible waste of money!It is constantly re-setting itself- even when the power hasn't gone out. It's difficult to reset as well. I get to spend hours every week listening to its sensors shriek from the garage.The training remote is constantly losing contact with the collar- making it useless for correction.Worst of all, the collar is poorly made. The closure for it is garbage. Our dog could easily remove it. After a short two months of use, the collar fell off, the dog disappeared, and then the maintenance man ran over the lost collar with the lawn tractor. It's $120 to replace it.Quite frankly, I'd rather dig up the entire fence and buy another brand than replace this useless, non-functioning, poorly made collar!"
5,Could not put it down,I stayed home from work today to read Midlife Mamas. You have expressed exactly how I feel about so many things and given me great ideas for my future.
5,This Mama's Moved!,"Sunny Hersh is like my best buddy, sister, grandmother, gynocologist and advisor, all in one comfortable living room just chatting away. I haven't even finnished it yet and I find it intensely sincere, fun, authentic, very informative and encouraging.One feels hugged, stroked, pinched, informed and curious. I will definately refer back to the book when health or finances or career need an injection of freshness. Perfect Midlife counterpoint. I keep wanting to share it with some else. It deals with our lives in such an upbeat way. I love it!"
5,Classic Mechanical Engineering,Great for mechanical engineers or students who want to get a classic perspective. Lot's of informative diagrams & illustrations.
3,Read Before You Buy,I wish someone told me that this manual only had a Sampling of solutions for each section. It did not help me much since it seemed that all the problems my professor assigned were the ones that were not in the manual. The book also has a wierd way of explaining things but I was able to struggle through. If I knew what I know now I would not have bought the book for full price but I would have purchased it used for half the price.
2,Not the full solutions,"Solutions are sometimes even more abstruse than the problems and concepts themselves. Someone got lazy writing out these solutions! Plus, more than half the problems are not solved in this book. Not worth $34 in my opinion."
3,did not use,"I got this solutions manual to help with my classes in case I get stuck. However, the professor never used the book for problems so I very got a chance to use the solution manual."
3,Elementary DE and Boundary Problems SSM,"Not a complete set of answers like I thought, But it does have many useful problems worked out."
2,Not What I Expected,"The product reads: Students Soluntions Manual to accompany Boyce Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems (paperback), only to find out there was no book, only a pdf file. Disappointed."
3,Differentials,"It's better than nothing..Doesn't show all steps to solving problems. Basically you have to go step by step in figuring out what the book did.Not all problems are solved like in most solutions manuals, just random problems."
5,Sweet!,"Bought a set of these, front and back, for my wife's new (used) 07 Jeep Commander. Fit like a glove, catch everything, don't slide around like I feared they might... installing the front ones I even popped off the door sill trim, put the side lip of the floor mat under and popped the sill trim on over it for a really tight fit. They also fit very well to the floor around the pedals, and we've had NO issues at all with getting snagged on them.Having a 2 1/2 year old and living in a state (WA) where it rains a lot these are SOOO much better than carpet floor mats since you can just pull them out, shake them off and rinse dirt, sand, whatever else right off with the hose. Definitely recommend you get a set for your rig. The color (we got grey) matched perfectly with the interior and despite ordering these in separate shipments they match each other perfectly. I'll likely be buying the rear cargo mat soon!"
5,For the maths oriented,This is the best book around on MEMS for those who are looking for the analytical solutions to electro-mechanical physics of MEMS devices.
4,The book's title said it all... Truly Irresistible!,"What a witty, well written page turner! I laughed from chapter one to the very last chapter's sentence. It's hilarious with the most unusual set of circumstances occuring throughout the story that keep you rivited to this book. Loved the plot and characters. Truly worthy of 4.5 stars!"
5,This book is for men!!!,"Anyone who assumes that this book is only for women is wrong!!! Most men--including myself--know precious little about women's bodies and the subtleties of giving them sexual pleasure. What I learned from Dr. Hutcherson's book is that like good parenting, good sex is not something that we are born knowing how to do; they both take require care, tenderness, listening, sharing, and a willingness to learn.I would strongly urge women to give this book to their male sexual partners."
1,What a title..,"I would never buy a book with ""mother"" and ""sex"" both included in the title. Not to mention how bad ""sexpert Hilda"" sounds.--The Notorious book-cover-judger."
4,Good Info,"Good Info, somewhat embarrasing, but necessary. After 15 years of marriage, I didn't realize I could learn more : )"
4,Confirmation Information - Sex is Great at Any Age,"This book is great. I was driving to work, listening to the radio, and this doctor/author began talking about her book. I was encouraged by what she had to say and ordered the book right away. Blunt, direct and to the point. Great stuff!"
2,"for the truly, truly inexperienced","If you don't already know the stuff written in this book, then you need much more help than any one author can provide. This book is ideal for people who have been living in a convent their entire adult lives.I give it two stars though, because I imagine there are many misinformed people out there, so if you're that person, read it."
3,"Good Info, but nothing new.",This book is a good reference but doesn't really provide any information that was very unique. I'm pretty sure that my mother could have told me about everything included.
3,All good.,I do not like doing these ratings. I will certainly let you know if I am dissatisfied with anything. Thanks.
3,Buddhists of Faith,Great book by one of the originators of American Buddhism. Get it if you have doubt.
4,Seeking Truth,"I purchased this book wanting to see someone else's spiritual journey and while there is an element of that journey the book is more about looking for your own personal truth. I think that is a hard thing for most American's to grasp, the idea that a spiritual journey is not just about finding a ""God"" but really about finding yourself.Very enjoyable read with nice insights. Well worth the read."
4,"A good read, but...","Mississippi Blues builds upon the world and characters in Queen City Jazz. Although the plot lags in places, overall the book unfolds with exactly the kind of upbeat pessimism good blues music is famous for. It's not The Bones of Time, but still a very satisfying read."
4,"Slow start, but worth the wait.","How many times have you wished you could change other people's minds? Imagine that power being within reach of any determined individual or group -- philosophies and core beliefs and even whole identities spreading (literally) as viruses. Now imagine that this has been going on for hundreds of years. This is a book that dares to think big, and to answer its own questions with unflinching candor. And there's action, too!"
4,VW Mirror Replacement,"Had to use a few parts from the original mirror as this one didn't quite fit 'as is' on our '79 convertible Beetle, but that seems to be typical with after-market parts. Ultimately this mirror worked fine as a replacement to the original."
4,Good supplement,"Good book overall on ideas for using attachments to your stand mixer. Nice layout, nice photography. However, if I were to choose only one book on recipes for stand mixers, I'd get ""The Essential Mixer Cookbook"" (which I did) instead."
2,I was disappointed,"I had hoped for more from this cookbook, and I was let down. I had hoped for more mixer recipes, but what I got was a few attachment recipes. It would take more time to switch all of the attachments they want to make these recipes."
3,Not what I thought it would be like.,"I got this book about a week ago and have yet found a recipe that I would ""Star"" to make again. The dessert section is very small. I wish I didn't buy it."
2,House Organ,"This is just a supplemental book for the Kitchen Aid mixer line. I agree with another reviewer, you'd spend as much time assembling and then cleaning the attachments as if you'd done it conventionally. Reminds me of all the food processor cookbooks that came out twenty-something years ago, finding excuses to use the machine even when not called for. I guess that maybe if people got a K'Aid and wanted to play with their new toy and its attachments that this would make sense. Many of the recipes sound a little too twee for me anyway. The meatloaf looks repulsive, is really more a meat-and-vegetable pate than a true meat loaf--and expensive to make! Desserts, pastries, breads, the real strong points of a good stand mixer, are shortchanged in this book. I use Bosch and Electrolux mixers rather than K'Aid (not strong enough) and found little to use in my machines. Avoid unless you can get it cheap--"
5,Very Good Book,"I got this book with a new mixer for x-mas and I am buying two more for gifts. This book inspires me to want all the attachments, I highly recommend it."
4,Smooth transaction. The book is a bit worn out,"A very good book for young people, especially those feel lost or confused in career, social, and life."
1,Remember Windows 95?,"In the bottom left corner of the box is a teesy reference to WORKS WITH WINDOWS 95. Really! Vista's cool ability to adjust compatibility DOES NOT WORK on this product nor is it listed on compatible products. ""The version of this file is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running. ...contact the publisher."" Hmmmm Looks like current searcfh engines can't seem to find either Publisher's Paradise OR Media Graphics as alive today. If you have a working OLD computer, this might be for you!"
5,well made.,"A well made figurine of the Teen Titans character, with all design & color features correct."
4,Celtic Big buckle,I really like this buckle and it adds another dimension to my wardrobe. Well made and generates discussion. A good addition to one's wardrobe if you use detachable buckles.
3,a pretty good read,"i liked this book...i have recently become interested in learning about witchcraft and have read a little and i have found that sometimes people take shaky theories and psuedo-history as fact...cabot didn't do this too much, which i appreciated. her adaptions of the stories are fairly accurate, but the originals (in translation) aren't that hard to read, if you want to get the real thing, primary text-wise...i liked a lot of her general theories on life, i particulary appreciated how they didn't exclude people who weren't witches. It often read like a self-help book and i think, a fairly effective one. at any rate, it has got me wanting to learn more on the subject."
2,Not A Cabot Fan,"I am not a fan of Laurie Cabot's. I do not like her writing style at all. I can't say that I found the information she provided to be empowering or useful. There are many other, wonderful pagan authors that I would recommend over Cabot."
2,OKAY...,"Well I have read parts of this book and like all books of this nature I feel like I should express a little of my opinion on the matter. Not all women are healers or have the capability to heal. For instance I watched Americas Most Wanted and have noticed that their is a lot of women who kill and rob. I suppose they have the ability to heal just because they are women? Yeah right.I'm not saying that their is something wrong with self empowerment but saying that your whole gender wether your male or female has some divine gift like healing for instance is stupid. Some people are better in somethings than others and I've found that gender actually has very little to do with what gifts that person has.If feminists are so much for equal rights than why don't they stop using such general terms like ""women self-empowerment"" and start using terms like ""individual self-empowerment."""
5,Trio for Lute are three of my all-time favorites.,Macavoy's Damiano trilogy is rare in that she maintains the suspense and the interesting characters through all three books. It is one story which I find myself thinking about again and again. The ideas about God and life which Damiano considers on his journey come back to me in my own journey. I wish she would write more.
4,Great story. BAD Kindle transcription,"The story deserves a full five stars. Unfortunately it is painfully obvious that the books were put over to the Kindle by scanning pages from the print version, running the image files through OCR and slapping the file together without any proofreading. This shows considerable disrespect for both customer and the material."
4,Damiano,"It was a pleasant surprise to find this old book online. I had found this book at work many years ago, and was drawn into the story, and enjoyed as well the next two books in the series, Damiano's Lute and Raphael. I spent less than 50 cents on all three books, plus shipping, a pretty good deal for a personal blast from the past."
4,Overall a nice CD,"I'm a masseuse, and this is my favorite series to use for work if I'm not using instrumental soundtracks.Generally speaking, I don't use every single track for my work playlist due to the instrumentals or melody being a bit too fast paced, or vocals that tend to be a little jarring, but I'll use the majority of the CD. This particular track list had me only use about half of what was on there, but I still get a good 30-40 minutes of music out of it that I can use."
1,Not even close,I ordered this expecting it to be larger flat beads in a pink tone. When I opened it I found tiny round orange beads. Very disappointed with the necklace. Don't even think it would be worth returning though since I paid so much for shipping...
1,faulty premise,"The book is based on the assumption that you can find someone dumb enough to sell you real estate for a 20% to 50% discount. 99.9999% of sellers and their advisors aren't that stupid. If you are that good of a negotiator, you probable already have unlimited riches. The book is a re-hash of the same get rich quick/no money down stuff that has been sold in infomercials and seminars for the past 20 years."
3,Investing vs. Book Writing,My only problem is if one is making tons of money in Real Estate Investing why write more than one book? I'm guessing writing books is more profitable otherwise he wouldnt take time out to write three or more books. How can you have time to write books when you are a real estate investor? The book business must be easier or the only cash cow.Good luck to readers and author.
3,Show me the money,"I read some good reviews of this book, but after reading the book they made me feel like they were written by the author or by some of his friends. Like most books that promise the world, the content under delivers. The book had some great points in it, but it left out some key pieces of information, like how much money you need to get started and what makes a good market from a bad one. He had some great suggestions on what you need to do in order to be a great landlord, but at times I felt like the book was an advertisement for his web site and the services he provides there (for a fee, of course). The book could have been half as long and provided the same information. Writing in the first person, telling his own version of ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" kept the pace fast, but at times was annoying. If you are considering seriously to get into real estate investing, this isn't a bad book to have, but you shouldn't make it your only one."
3,Not what the LA TImes promised. maybe ok for 1st timer,"I have a few other real estate books and read a great review of this in the LA Times, (thinking they have been right before). This book does have a few good ideas and resent them well. The one thing I thought Robert would cover is HOW he secures some of his financing and different financing options. It felt a bit self-serving when he devoted too much space to the legal service he uses and now represents. I may look at his earlier works before I buy again. I would really love to hear from others on definitive real estate investing books."
2,Good idea but.....,".....my girls only picked at it. They ate a few bites when the can was freshly opened but that was it. To be fair, they are old (16 and 17) and picky so a younger cat may chow down on this."
5,a proven item,gates belts are excellent replacement parts.i have used this brand of v belts for 38 years.i depend on them to keep my vehicles on road.
4,"good, but not great","* Love it -- it works!!* Love it -- the battery itself is easy to install.* Love it -- I placed the order with Amazon in late-November 2009 and the battery I received was manufactured in October 2009; only 1 month old* Dislike it -- on my X61T, this 8 cell battery reports only about 4hr uptime after a full recharge (on Lenovo's product website it suggested ""approximately 7 hours"".)* Dislike it -- the old battery died after only about 14 months* Hate it -- Lenovo battery does not come with a handy ship-the-old-battery-back-for-safe-disposal shipping slip (Unlike Lenovo, America Power Conversion (APC) does for their UPS batteries. The APC UPS battery comes with a already-filled shipping label; and you can just take out the new battery, put the old battery in the same shipping box, apply the new shipping label, and then send the old batteries back to APC for safe disposal.)"
1,CAUTION - not as advertised!,"This keeps coming up as a replacement for the Lenovo x61 tablet PC. Even if you search for the specific part number (42T5209), it brings this up. Unfortunately, the pictures do not show enough to differentiate and I ordered it (even though it was 2-3x the cost of others, it had a high star rating.) Low star for misrepresenting what PC's it can be used for. They ""hide"" codes in the description to draw in searchers, but now I have to start again at zeros after returning. Re-searched again this morning and it is STILL misdirecting customers."
4,battery,"The Thinkpad by lenovo is not that great of a product in itself, but since I am required to use it for school , this battery works nicely as a replacement for the one that died out earlier. I have been using it for several months with no problems yet"
3,Thinkpad Tablet X61 8-cell Battery,"Why I had to buy a new battery? Thinkpad Tablet X61 is only 14 months old and cost more than U$ 2100.My old original OEM battery gives an error message ""A battery error has occurred. The battery cannot be charged.""Lenovo website lists my original battery as ""DEFECTED"" with free replacement but you must go through a program they provide to test the battery. It never works, forget about calling Lenovo, they don't honor anything. I work for IBM and I have bought 7 laptops before. THIS WAS MY LAST ONE.I hope the new battery will last more than the first one. It is working just fine for now."
1,Live and Learn,"I used to be very fond of Charlie Rose's program and I was very interested in seeing his interview with Lee Scott, CEO of Wal-Mart. What I thought was that this interview would further expose the fact that Wal-Mart was failing its employees and, in many ways, its customers as well. What I found, watching the program, was instead a more or less non-stop pro-Wal-Mart and pro-Lee Scott advertisement invented by Lee Scott with Charlie simply listening, nodding his head, and saying, ""Uh-huh,"" pretty much throughout the hour. Later, a fellow I worked with pointed out that these sort of, so-called ""interviews,"" aren't like real news interviews and that probably Charlie wasn't even allowed to ask any unpreapproved questions.I watched this program. I didn't buy it. I stopped watching Charlie Rose."
2,Rating,According to my wife's opinion you need improve the race of features she doesn't look like a real chilenean just clothes a little beat
3,Good for fine Hair,If you have a lot of really thick hair this iron is not for you. It doesn't heat up as hot as a ceramic iron would. It does leave your nice and full though.
3,"wigo just ""ok""","I purchased this because a friend had raved to me about how great it was, but I'm not that impressed. Honestly, I notice little difference from my cheapy ceramic flat iron I got for 15 bucks.. I would go for the chi if you want a good one-shrugs-"
4,Won't damage your hair,"I had used this hair straightener for years when it broke, so I had to buy a new one. The jade (rahter than ceramic) won't dry out or damage your hair.It doesn't get insanely hot like other straighteners where it will make your hair hot to the touch. Because of this I was never as worried of it burning down the house if I forgot it on.My hair is thick and somewhat difficult to straighten, and although it doesn't make my hair nearly as straight as the Chi does, it also doesn't kill it.I love it and would recommend it to people who don't want to damage their hair with a straightener. It works better on thinner hair."
2,would not recommend,i did not like this flat iron it left my hair feeling kinda dry n it was no body left in my hair after using it i would not buy this product again or reccomend it to anyone
1,WORST IRON EVER,THIS IS THE WORST IRON MADE.CATCHES BURNS ENDS OF HAIR NEVER SOFT PLATE IS LIKE A ROCK SHARP EDGES.STAY AWAY IF YOU WANT YOUR HAIR.
2,disappointed,"This book has nice pictures, but not nearly enough projects. (only 5 very simple ones)It is good maybe for a beginner but, I need more of a challenge and more variety ."
3,Pretty but.....,The instructions are sketchy. You can't really MAKE anything with this book...no projects...but the pictures of the finished pieces are pretty. I'd definitely go with a Dalene Kelly book before this one.
3,"Beautiful book, silly projects","I was excited to find this beautiful book at my local bookstore. It has a nice history of the art of beaded flowers and very comprehensive instructions. The photos are wonderful of what the best of this craft are currently doing plus vintage items. But if you are looking for a good project section, look elsewhere. The only projects are for 5 little corsages or pins that can be worn on a lapel. There are no instructions for arranging beaded flowers. This book stays on the bottom of my beaded flower book stack. It would be great if they would revise this book to include some real projects."
2,Glad I didn't buy,Well I have looked into different books on beaded flowers and saw reviews of this book so I went to my local library and requested it. Well when I got it I sat and looked through it while I did like how the instructions were simple and clear I did find it was lacking in projects I got a few of the other books out there and feel they are much better. I did love the galeray of flowers in the middle of the book and would have rather had the patterns for some of those flowers instead. I will say if you really want this book find it at the library and copy the first few pages in techniques and return it. Don't buy it.
5,At last! I can do it!,"I have purchased three or four books on beaded flowers prior to this one, and I am excited to have finally found one with clear instructions and good illustrations. The instructions are as basic as you can get, and I was able to make my first petals without any frustration at all. In addition, there are wonderful photographs of both vintage and modern pieces. I have gobbled up every Interweave beading book to date, and with this book they continue their excellent publication record."
2,"Nice to look through, but...","I thought that the structure of the book was very unbalanced. The instructions are nice, but they are all in the front part of the book, and are hand-drawn. Color photos of finished projects are in the second part of the book. I prefer a book that has step-by-step instructions included with each project. Also, not very many projects are included. I hate to say it, but I've seen better books on french beaded flowers. To be fair, there are some very nice arrangement that provide inspiration.Nice to look through, but I wouldn't recommend buying it to keep."
1,sources?,A book like this really should site the sources for this information. It obviously relies on a lot of other work.
5,It is not all about us,"I have been working for over three decades and up until 2 years ago was blissfully ignorant of the joys and tribulations of working with people from another nation. I was sent to the UK for two weeks and returned home extremely frustrated as I felt that we had gotten nothing done. As long as I was there I was planning on getting done what I thought I had been sent to do. In typical fashion, when on a deadline (mine not theirs), I was expecting to work late and on the weekend. Well no, they left on time and definitely were not working the weekend. Hmmm. Really enjoyed working with them but my rush was definitely not their rush. But enough of that...now this little gem would have helped to set the stage for that trip and I only wish I would have had it to prepare me somewhat for working with people who speak the same language but approach work with a different attitude. It is eye opening and I know it will help in the future as I am exposed to other cultures and nationalities."
3,Too broad a topic...,"The discussion was so broad that it was almost irrelevant. It is not Peterson's fault though. Any discussion about every culture in the world is necessarily broad, but I think I would have gotten more out of the book if it focused on a specific area of the world."
3,"Too Many ""probablys""","I agree that Pagan Kennedy is an excellent storyteller, and her telling of William Sheppard's story is spellbinding. Contrary to what some reviewers think, however, there is much more primary material available to the researcher than Kennedy seems to have used. Unfortunately, Black Livingstone is marred by too many suppositions--maybe, probably, perhaps, could have, should have, etc.--and the author attributes attitudes both to Sheppard and his associates that cannot be substantiated from records. William Phipps's biography, William Sheppard: Congo's African American Livingstone, presents a much more balanced picture of this important man's life and service."
2,More tale than true,"Ms Pagan has taken too few facts to construct a clay hero... ""true tale"" is truly an oxymoron! This book will be a deep disappointment to anyone interested in the history of the Congo or missions in Africa. I would like my money back which is not an option,but this piece of ""thin cloth"" is not going to sit on my missions history shelf... ."
4,The Tale of the Congo,"Pagan Kennedy told the story of a African American missonary who wanted to convert the uncharted parts of the Congo to christianity. William Sheppard, the missionary, was very determined to complete his goal of converting the Congo even if it took his whole life. I Could not put the book down. The book was basically a detailed sum up of what really went on in the Congo. At some points in the book it almost seemed fictional because it was so hard to believe what was happening to him amd the people who were with him. The book was a very good read, but at some points hard to understand but that added to the suspense of the book. Overall the book was a very fun an interesting book to read. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about the Congo or who wants to find a good book to read."
2,This is waste of money!,First of all if you aren't obssessed with an artist or group dont buy any of their interview cd's. So ask yourself: Is Britney Spears the greatest person to live? if you said no dont event think twicwe about buying this cd- if u said yes- only buy this cd if u already own In Conversation and The Star Profile (two good interviews). THis interview is old has absolutely no new info on Britney and Britney talks for probably only 2% of the time. Bottom Line: Only for extreme die hard fans!
3,Not one of the best Britney Interviews,"This is not a very good interview CD. It contains little unique or interesting information. I would recommend The Star Profile or In Conversation over this. Also, the star Profile comes with an 100 page mini Britney Spears book and Maximum Britney only comes with a puny fold out poster"
3,Extra strength,"Was well worth it in its time. Used it for one year and then gaveit away, as PDAs gave way to Smartphones."
1,not a pleasant smell,I was so excited to receive this perfume but about 30 minutes after I sprayed it on my wrists my eyes started burning like crazy and I got a headache. Will not be able to wear this and you cannot return it so I'm stuck with something I have to pay for but can't use.
2,You get what you pay for.,"Based on the price, the quality of the desk is what you would expect. <br />The desk is small, just the right size for my 8-year-old. I do not expect the desk to last for a long time, however, it is a good interim piece. The drawer bottoms, as well as the back panel are all cardboard. You will not be able to put anything heavy in the drawers. <br />It comes completely unassembled. The directions were easy to follow, however, it took about 4 hours to put it together."
3,Desk,"Its ok. Functional for a girls room. No major wow. Easy to assemble. Careful when moving, not sturdy piece of furniture. My daughter likes and it does fit well in her small bedroom. Chair was purchased seperately,"
3,Good information on blood pressure but didn't work for me.,Another one of my tries for something to work. Seems like everything works for the people in the book but doesn't seem to have any effect on me. I tried but didn't really impact my Blood pressure. Could fit someone else but wasn't a good fit for me.
5,Exactly what I wanted,"These items are exactly what I wanted. The RG-6 cable would stick out in the room too much for me, so this little adaper saves on the cable having to bend. Item came fairly quickly. Will buy from this vendor if the need arises again."
2,Not impressed,"This adapter comes in two steel parts, which are simply pressed into each other at a 90 degree angle with a little bit of pressure. If you pull the two parts apart (will happen naturally if any tension is applied at either end), then the two parts will separate. That's what happened to me within 60 seconds of plugging this adapter in. The part that fell off consists itself of three parts, which are quite tricky to get back in again - it took me several minutes to work out how to put it back together again. Overall, not impressed at all by this adapter. I expected one single piece of steel, not two pieces flimsily held together. If this thing falls apart again, I will probably buy another adapter to replace it, but for now I'm hoping it won't."
1,Pretty bad.,"So I got this to relieve cable stress and be able to point the cable in a different direction then straight out from the wall.Initially it did fine, however when I went to unplug it, it broke. Also, this took FOREVER to get to me (not sure how long, but I remember thinking that maybe it had gotten lost in the mail.I am trying to find a better product that fufills the same need, but nothing as of yet."
3,Took forever to get it,"Decent quality, you get what you pay for. I got it but it took weeks. The slow boat from china does exist."
5,Just what I needed,"This was just what I needed to make the connection at the back of my TV, where the wall bracket didn't allow enough room for the cable to come straight out from the TV and turn sharply. Product as advertised and delivered promptly."
1,Poor connection and quality,"The connection this elbow provides is very poor. We had static most of the time. When I tried to tighten the connections, the elbow feel appart. Save you money and purchase and betty quality elbow."
1,Don't waste your money,"This angle adapter is garbage. The signal loss across it is the major problem, the picture is so fuzzy it's unwatchable. Also it is cheaply made. Mine split right where the male side makes the 90 degree transition."
3,"Cheap cost, poor quality","Within five minutes of connecting the right-angle adapter to the coax cable, it fell apart. The casing is not one solid piece and is not bonded together. The pieces look like metal but feel like plastic. I put the pieces together and it kept falling apart. Finally I put it back together with some adhesive and it works fine. Not a complete waste though, it did finally serve the purpose after I glued it together."
2,Mediocre antenna,"The coils apply capacitive reluctance to fool meters. The Q factor does not apply to small coils.A cheapo $9 Radio Shack 102 whip will give you superior receive or transmit.A "" radio tech"" will be honest with his customers and admit this is a compromise. A $5 fiberglass whip will function the same but not elicit the same "" Wow"" looks."
4,Fragmentation of Afganistan,I received two copiesof book and returned one. I did enjoy the book very much.
1,Not recommended,"This type of product will only disappoint. It advertizes x675 magnification but a telescope of this aperture can only deliver a maximum of x120 under perfect conditions. These types of telescopes are bought, tried once and left in the closet. The optics are poor, it is hard to find anything and even if you do find anything with a .965"" eyepiece it won't be fun to look at.You would be much better off buying something like the Orion Starblast."
3,Not all it is cracked up to be,"This book obviously rests on the laureates of Polit and Hungler who were once well known for their research texts. This is just a revision of the same old...same old. The chapter on qualitative research is incomplete, and the examples are outdated. There are many newer more up to date and creative texts that focus the students to CRITICALLY think about what they are reading as they read it. This text does not. Keep it on the shelf, or use it as a doorstop."
5,Great book,"Really good book, we read it every night before bed and my 2 1/2 year old daughter has been saying ""thank you"" for everything."
5,Adorable,This is a cute review of manners for little ones. My two year old loves Madeline and this book is a new favorite. This book covers all the basics of good manners in the typical Madeline rhyme and I think it will be good for her for a few years.
3,cute book,"This is cute for kids who are Madeline fans. It has some good lessons, too. However, it is not a story, more like each page contains seperate prose about good manners. So, it is not a great story and my little girl will read it, but she doesn't ask for it over and over like the other Madeline books because there is no story to it."
3,teaching manners,This book is useful for teaching basic manners to a young girl who loves the character Madeline. It is not a story in the traditional sense and if you are expecting a book in the vein of the classic five Madeline's you will be disappointed. On the up side it makes manners seem classy to the younger set.
1,3500 problems,"Honestly, this book should be called ""3,500 Problems in Electrical Circuits"" - the 3000 problems presented along with the 500 errors in their solutions. Buyer beware - unless you're confident in your circuit skills and just want to solve problems - be careful! This book has incorrect solutions from missing terms to magically appearing factors of 10 to misspellings (even misspelling Newton! which is the equal of scientific sacrilege). Many of the circuit drawings are not even clean CAD drawings but cruder hand drawings...All of this shows a clear lack of attention, review and editing - so unless you wish to perform these functions, move on! This is the product of a cram session overnighter in order to get a paycheck... The value equivalent of ""Britney Spears Guide to Class and Refinement""..."
2,Stylish but difficult to maintain,"I've had one of these for several years now, and although it looks stylish, it is not great to maintain and your options regarding fish and plants are quite limited. I've being doing weekly partial water changes, but the chunky ceramic media makes it very difficult to hoover up the debris with a gravel cleaner. Plus the fact that the filtration unit is right in the centre of the tank, limiting your space when you clean. My local aquarium shop says the filtration is not particularly good on these tanks, and I've been boosting mine with a small internal unit. Also, you can't really grow much in these tanks, so you are limited to artificial plants if you want to decorate your tank (there are plenty of such accessories sold for the Biorb and Biube.) It's fine for a starter tank with say a handful of small tropical fish, but that's about it."
2,"Pretty, but not worth the trouble","I bought a BiUbe in April and since then I had 4 sea anemones, 2 cleaner shrimp, 1 fire shrimp, 2 star fish, 2 damsel fish, and many corals die! For starters, the light unit that comes with this tank is not strong enough for the animals. I bought both the IntelliLight and have the original light and neither work well enough to keep the animals alive. Next, it doesn't come with the other helpful accessories such as a powerhead. The cleaning for the unit is a bit of a hassle because you can't arrange the rocks anywhere near the center because then you have to move them to change the filter. I'm going to sell my unit and look towards a NanoCube. Yes, its pretty, but that's about it."
3,Not bad,"This is not a brilliant cook book. Nor is David Wood a brilliant caterer. But I'll tell you this: his chocolate chip cookie recipe is the best I've ever tried. My suggestion is get the book from the library, photocopy the cookie information, but don't buy the whole book."
2,Samsonite contour neck pillow,Not very comfortable to use. Was not able to use it at all on the airplane.
2,Not as good as I thought it would be,"I looked at the pictures , read the reviews , was convinced that it was going to be comfortable and provide me the required rest during those long airline trip . But was dissapointed . The pillow does inflate fine , but its not comfortable , and is definately not soft . I would recommend bying a pillow with softer material . I bet , when you go to the Airports , you see the ones available for $12 , I suggest just go with one of those . I got a grey one with soft padding + velvet exterior ......and I have been sleeping a lot more comfortably ( much longer) that my trips before . My suggestion .....skip it , it's not as comfortable as it seems to be"
1,Not comfortable,"My wife and I have both used this pillow and found it very uncomfortable to sleep on our long distance flights. We were not satisfied with it, would have preferred a softer material for the pillow."
2,Better products out there,"My family and I moved to Germany recently and I wanted a pillow that would help the long flight overseas be more comfortable. Unfortunately, this product didn't help. It isn't very comfortable, it is unwieldy and the material the cover is made out of doesn't feel very good on the skin.While the price is nice and the pillow is easy to transport after it's deflated, I can't really say this is a great pillow."
2,almost a great travel pillow,"This pillow is really comfortable. I liked the way it supported my head and neck during long flights from Florida to Perth, Australia. However, it was almost impossible for me to remove the plugs to release the air."
1,Not that comfortable,I bought this product seeing the company backing it but unfortunately I have to say the product is not at all comfortable. It does not feel cozy at all. I did not like this product.
4,Not quite perfect,"I would give anything for a 5 star travel pillow. This pillow is not quite perfect but the closest of all of those I own- and my collection is growing. Doesn't have as much support as I would like but the fact that it has two chambers to raise is a bit plus. For those of us who travel alot, it is worth it to keep this little pillow in your case."
3,DId not know this was an air pillow,"The pillow arrived promptly. We intended to use it on a long trip. I would be satisfactory for a short trip, but I feel that it would not meet our needs for a 15 hour flight."
4,not bad,"I perfer something like cutton in side the pillow.However, this pillow is just a sort of airpillow, though it's convenient since it could save space."
1,Don't Bother!,This pillow was not worth the money. The one that I bought had sharp edges where the plastic was molded together! I actually had cuts on my neck after using it.
4,Comfortable and easy to carry,"This was a great buy since it is easy to carry around while traveling.Pros:- I have tried a few other pillows as well but the shape of this one along with the flexibility of the extra pocket on the top beats out the competitors in the same price range. The presence of the extra pocked (can be inflated separately) along with the shape of the pillow provides great neck and head support.- Much cheaper than buying the same pillow at the airport.Cons:- Filling in air is a bit difficult, you have to close the opening promptly to avoid the air escaping."
4,Stinky but useful,"The plastic-y smell from this pillow makes it a bit hard to concentrate on your zzzzs. But its especially useful if you like to rest your head forward on the lap table on the plane, has nice support for your forehead like the ones on massage tables."
1,"Uncomfortable, waste of money",It is not comfortable at all. I just want to add one more point all ready all other drawbacks are written in other reviews. The inner edges are sharp and it gives a cutting feel in your neck.
3,"Samsonite Double Comfort Travel Pillow with Pouch, Grey","Holds your neck up from front to back, but didn't do much for side to siide. And the seam between the top and bottom was irratating and uncomfortable on the back of my neck. Not the right solution for me, but my GF uses it and hasn't complained after 5 trips."
1,A flawed product,"Just returned the item. The valves of both compartments are so short that it is very difficult to hold tight to cap the valves. When you finally managed to cap the valves, the air had mostly leaked out. The valve of the smaller compartment is positioned at the back of it, so as you lean against a chair and move your head slightly, the cap is unplugged."
2,Not practical,"Well, the circular area where you put your neck has sharp edges, so it will be inconvenient if you have a sensitive skin like mine. Also, it doesn't have this little plastic internal ""stopper"" that stops air from getting out when you fill it with air. Every time I used it, I turn red due to the excessive blowing I've to do."
5,incredible album,Jazzy downbeat abstract hip-hop at it's best. Thank you Nicknack for making this beautiful music.
1,Don't Move Here!,"I was checking out Amazon's new feature, called ""Purchase Circles"" where you can check out what people in a specific area are buying. So, I thought I'd find out what music is topping the Amazon charts here in San Diego. That's how I got here--because this collection of junk is #1! There seems to be a never-ending exodus of folks from everywhere else coming to live here in San Diego. They think that it is paradise. But be warned! We have plenty of trailer trash, single-digit IQ, horizontal family tree, knuckle-dragging, ignorant rednecks, too--as this cd's popularity here shows. So stay home."
2,Way Too Salty,"This sauce would be wonderful, but for our family it's way too salty. I made a wonderful shrimp and vegetable dish and added the Iron Chef Sesame Garlic sauce to it and served it on top of rice. I wound up throwing all my rice out to get rid of the sauce. It was so salty I couldn't stand the taste. My husband felt the same. This seems to be a major problem with store bought sauces. I'm not sure why they don't leave the salt out altogether or put just a small amount in the sauce. Salt is inexpensive and so easy to add when desired. However, it's impossible to remove it. I tried to contact ""Iron Chef"" but there isn't any contact information on their website. If you like salty sauce, this may be for you. Otherwise, either look for something else or make your own."
3,Not so good in the dark,"I have tried several cameras in this price range all different brands and I think this camera does well during daylight, but in the dark it does not. The LED's seem to only light up the center of the image and the edges are dark. The less the contrast the more washed out the image is at night.The mounting bracket is a little hard to work with, but it allows many different positions which is good. I also liked the size of this camera not to big to hide under eves."
1,Come On,"I just received the camera and it was the wrong camera. They delivered an inferior camera, the 43CIR. When I called to return the item they tried to sell me the camera I ordered for a much higher price.If you already ordered this camera, make sure you have the correct camera.If you are thinking this is a good price, well it is only because they are shipping a different camera."
4,well presented and accessible,A well presented and accessible review of the basic principles of animation and its organization. By encouraging the readers to ask themselves questions about the various proposed tasks the author helps to move them towards self-reliance.
4,Very Good,I was very surprised to find that I had a hard time putting this book down. I will definately be watching for more of J. Carson Black Novels. She is a Great Author. I need to be interested from the very beginning to enjoy a book and this was full of suspense from the very beginning.
3,Darkness on the Edge of Town,"I am new to Kindle for PC. I am a mystery snob. My favorites being Michael Connolly, John Sanford and others. This ebook was readable for .99 cents. Very prosaic and predictable. I liked the positive characters. I thought the protaganists were weakly constructed and portrayed. J. Carson Black defintely has story writing talent. She needs better proofreading & editing assistance. If she sold a 1,000 ebooks at .99 cents maybe she made a bit of money on this one. I applaud her effort. It is not an easy thing to do, write a mystery thriller. Cudos to her."
