2,not worth it,I bought this camera 6 or 7 months ago it took great pics and we were enjoying it but then the zoom stoped working right before we went on vacation and had to buy another one we replaced it with a non kodak camera
4,Excellent purchse,"It is easy to use and the picture quality is sharp and very good so far. I tried video recording with 2GB sd card which I purchased it together and it worked excellent so far. I recommend this to anyone. And the price, you can't beat it."
2,Too raunchy,"This book begins with a day in the life of Raven Ward. Raven was a very attractive, independent woman that possessed a strange sexual appetite.I could have enjoyed this book more without all of the raunchy sex. I do not believe that Ms. Tilles blamed Raven's unsafe sex on her being cheated on. How many women go through this same thing and do not become whores?This book possessed promise but the sex was a tad bit too much."
5,THABOMB,"Jessica is a major force in this book world, that can not be touched.This book will take you everywhere. Her words are intriguing, her scenes are incredible. This girl put her foot in this one.Thanks for the ride."
1,Where is my advil ???,Advil liquigels are excellent for headaches. I am writing this review to warn customers that this product from Amazon does not ship in 1 or 2 weeks (as advertised). I ordered this product more than 2 months ago and am still waiting for it to be shipped. It is probably a good idea to spend the extra few bucks and buy this from the grocery store (like I had to eventually do when I ran out).
5,FABULOUS,"I loved this creative CD that is great for kids of ALL ages. (not too scary, but lots of fun). The music is great and there are famous folks like david cassidy singing! A MUST HAVE"
5,Kid Pix #1 for Halloween Howls,My seven-yr-old requested this CD after hearing it at a friends house. It is a fabulous CD to be listened to anytime of year. The songs are funny and are easy to sing to. Highly recommended by this mom!
4,Suitable music for Halloween,Most of the songs in this cd will help to create the Halloween atmosphere during our coming party. The first song sound haunting which put one in the mood.
4,Nostalgia rules!,"The originals are recordings from the mid 50's through mid 60's. To those of us 'of a certain age' they have been around seemingly forever and many have even been revered since their first release. There is a certain 'lilt' to these that really isn't achieved elsewhere. Kunzel and the Rochester Pops come close while Abravanel and the Utah forces dutifully play all the notes. The CD transfer is up to it's usual high standards (higher than some of the standards for the presssings on the originals); but it's the 3 channel SACD that is really impressive. If you have the capability, I highly recommend most any of the Mercury Living Presence or RCA Living Stereo SACD's. This one in particular will have you dancing and feeling like the ""Belle of the Ball"""
4,"A Good book on verbs, with a couple of problems.","I like this book, and it does a good job of what it sets out to do, but there are a few little things that bother me. I dislike roma-ji, and I'd prefer to see Kana in their place. This book has examples sentences in Japanese(using Kanji) follow by roma-ji, and then an English translation. I am assuming it is this way because the book is geared towards beginners, but it is still very useful for intermediate level students. The only other problem is that it doesn't teach you about compound verbs.I think most people will be happy with this book. The power Japanese series is a good series, even if they do use roma-ji."
5,a must for those studying japanese,"seeing as japanese verbs are so totally different to english ones, naoko chino's book was a saving grace. everything is cleary laid out and explained, with useful everyday verb phrases included, and a verb endings index at the back, this truly is a must for students of japanese."
4,A sure win!,"I found out that one of the most important things in learning the Japanese language is vocabulary and proper verb conjugation! This book helps so much with the verb conjucgation, that it will easily become one of your more useful reference books. Another plus is the use of both Japanese text and romanji. However, I would rather see NO romanji...since in learning Japanese, romanji does nothing in helping you advance. Again, Naoko has outdone herself with this book, and I look forward to all her new Japanese learning books!"
5,Another great book by Naoko Chino,"Naoko Chino has made some great books for learning Japanese. This is one of those books~If you have trouble with verb conjugation, this book will get you on the right track."
5,"Q. LAZZARUS ""Goodbye Horses"" is worth the price alone!","The track listing says it all:A-HA - THE SUN ALWAYS SHINES ON T.V. (Extended Version)FIGURES ON A BEACH - NO STARS (Unreleased Club Mix)BLANCMANGE - DON'T TELL ME (Dance Remix)HOWARD JONES - LOOK MAMA (Megamamamix)TEARS FOR FEARS - SHOUT (Dub Mix)OMD - SO IN LOVE (Brand New Extended Mix)FUZZBOX - INTERNATIONAL RESCUE (The Orgasmatron Mix)Q. LAZZARUS - GOODBYE HORSES (Extended Version)THE HUMAN LEAGUE - HUMAN (Extended Version)ALPHAVILLE - JET SET (Jellybean Mix)THE DREAM ACADEMY - THE LOVE PARADE (12"" Mix)YAZ - STATE FARM (Madhouse Mix)Worth it alone for the extended mix of the cult classic Goodbye Horses - one of the most sought after 12 inch singles of all time!"
2,bad transfer to digital,"The songs are great but the transfer to digital form was done poorly. The tracks sound terrible. The volume was jacked up way to high and the low frequencies are overwelming. If your looking for the extended version of goodbye horses, I recommend getting it either on the clerks 2 soundtrack(it sounds great on clerks 2) or spend the money on the original 12 inch single. All the other tracks can be found on their original 12 inch vinyl releases on online auctions for reasonable prices. So in love by Omd is a great song but its sounds terrible on this release. Dont bother buying this cd if you like quality sounding music."
3,Vendetta,"This movie was pretty good. I really liked the performance by John Draper as the ""Gunman In The Warehouse"". In my opinion this was some of the finest acting that I have seen since Pacino or DeNiro. His portrayal of a man torn between duty and a sense of right and wrong could be felt through the room. He wasn't in the movie long, but it isn't the quantity of time, it is the quality of the performance that left me wanting a sequel based on his character and how he became the gun for hire. The rest of the actors were pretty good, and there is a lot of action in this movie. I just don't think that they could have pulled off the strong beginning of the movie without the razor-sharp talent of Mr. Draper. I hope to see him in a bigger role next time."
3,"Over all, it's OK","In voyage, Baxter introduces the politics driving the space program. It is amazing any of the big space projects kept funding and momentum long enough to yield fruit. As always, I learned more about the world thanks to Baxter.On the other hand, he unecessarily convolutes time lines and seems to have put down and restarted the manuscript a number of times (repetition of minor details). The convolution made a fairly simple narative take on an undeserved importance and helped camouflage the repetitive parts. I wonder if the book's length is due to contractual obligation instead of story telling.Regardless, the good overshadows the bad. I'm glad I read it."
1,"""Failed To Keep My Interest""","As a big proponent of a manned mission to Mars, I looked forward to reading this book. While Baxter's characters showed a lot of promise, the slow pace of the story and lack of any possible conflict failed to keep my interest."
3,Could have been an excellent book.,A book about the future that takes the premise that Kennedy wasn't killed and therefore the space program went ahead in a more comprehensive and better funded form is a good concept if you can believe that he also controlled the Senate as well as Congress so he could get the funding proposals he wanted through. As well as this criticism the main characters are good examples of stock science fiction spacefillers. If you want to read a more realistic and believable story about space exploration read his other book on this topic 'Titan'.
2,"Good story, but oh how boring!",I've read all Baxter's other books and I think he's one of the best authors yet. However you just can't win them all. I had expected a bit more exploration and science on the Mars surface but the more closer t th end you get you feel like they will never get there. Although the technical details are very accurate they don't give anything more than more words to read. If you want to read a godd book read Ring and The Time Ships. They are his best.
1,Please Don't Call Anyone!,"Tweet is an awful artist and her track ""Call Me"" is an awful track! I can't believe they would make a Cd-Single for such a bad song. It wasn't even a hit, I think I heard it once on BET."
4,strong magnet,These magnets are of great strength for a very reasonable price. They are used to hang a full size clip board with 20-30 papers on it. No problem doing the job! The only point to be wary of is the hook sticks straight out so items hung on it dangle away from the surface. Best to avoid use on doors (as an example) that are open and closed often.
1,"I'm sure the magnet hooks are great, but...","...the seller is not! I ordered this item back at the beginning of August, for use in my elementary school classroom, and HomeandBeyond never did ship them, and sent a couple of excuses (the first, saying that the hooks were coming from another warehouse and they would be shipped in 2 days, but were not, and the second saying their shipping dept was looking into the ""problem""). Today I get an email saying that they have cancelled my order, no explanation, no nothing. Because the order was cancelled, I don't even get to leave feedback for the seller, which is very wrong. I would never order from them EVER if you actually want to receive your product!"
4,"Noise cancelling is good, but headphones are a little uncomfortable.",I find that the noise cancelling works well and does a good job of attenuating the noise at my office. My only complaint is that the headphones are a little uncomfortable after extended wear.I would recommend this product for those looking for reasonably price noise cancelling headphones.
2,"Great price, good noise canceling, but . . .",I bought these headphones less then 4 weeks ago and have used them moderately since then. A few days ago I noticed that a piece of the locking clip on the top of the headphones had broken and today I went to unfold them and the whole locking clip broke! The noise canceling ability of these headphones is great for the price and with a decent battery you can get more than 24 hours of use from them. I have never dropped them or done anything that would compromise the integrity of the plastic. So that leads me to believe that the plastic that they used to make them must be of a very low quality. The best noise canceling in the world is useless if you can't wear the headphones that have it.
1,A disappointing performance,"Based on previous reviews I had high hopes. Those reviews must have been paid endorsements because the performance was poor and that is being kind. The product does not cancel the noise (air travel) it replaced it with a different type of noise. I tried a pair of Sony headphones on another flight and the quality was truly superior. Also, be prepared to purchase a battery because the one that comes with the product is less than cheap. I would not recommend this product."
3,Not enough depth of the African-American influence on music,"I want to hear more influece on that ethnic woman has brought to the music. Many of the women on the cover fail to realize that the many of their style of music came from women and men of ethnic backround. If you don't belive me ask Maddona, Tina Turner, or Janis Joplin."
5,I'll Make This Simple For You...,Buy this album. It is a work of art. Butch Walker is a musical and lyrical genius. Like the Einstein of the pop rock world.
4,One of the best rock CDs in the last 20 years,"Butch Walker's solo debut is a masterpiece of pop/rock-with-a-hard-edge songwriting and recording, just like his last Marv.3 group CD ""Ready Sex Go"" was. Butch is known and respected in the music business but not enough yet by fans of great pop and rock music. This CD should have sold huge. 9 of 12 songs are keepers. ""Sober"", ""Far From Close To You"", ""Take Tomorrow"", and ""Into The Black"" are instant classics. Great melodies, great vocals, great harmonies, solid guitar work and production. Spread the word, ""Left Of Self-Centered"" is a must have.Butch's latest 2004 CD, ""Letters"" is a more mellow effort, which is more what I usually like, but the songwriting and melodies are not as strong as Butch's last 3 CD efforts. Only 3-4 songs are memorable. But any Butch is good Butch...""Left Of Self-Centered"" is great Butch!"
2,Time to grow up.,"I'm a huge fan of Butch Walker. I think he's a major talent and a true rock star. However, it's time to get over the trite, teeny bopper lyrics. Melodies and guitars are good (thats the 2 stars) but come on, Butch, you're a grown up with a cool, fun edge...act and write like it. We're not on the playground anymore."
2,Very Disappointing,"I discovered Butch Walker and Marvelous 3 after reading about them on the Metal Sludge website. I heard clips of Marvelous 3's ""Sugarbuzz"" and ""Supernatural Blonde"" and instantly became a huge fan. I later heard ""My Way"" from this album and have been eagerly awaiting it ever since. Unfortunately, the rest of the album sounds nothing like it. Instead of being upbeat and rockin', the majority of the album is dark, depressing, and super-poppy.Fans of Motley Crue's ""Generation Swine"" album may like ""Into the Black"" (which features Nikki Sixx on bass), but the rest of it is totally forgettable.I had hoped that Butch walker would be the savior to bring back the fun, happy, hard rock sound the 80's. Instead his lyrics focus on such grim subjects as death, infidelity, drug addiction, rape, and bad relationships.Butch obviously has the talent to be a huge rock star. It's unfortunate that he chooses to waste it making this depressing pop drivel."
4,Summer Music at its Best,"This is a wonderful cd I love to listen to. Perfect for background music during those warm summer nights during your barbecue party or as you cook dinner with friends gathered around. This was my first introduction to flamenco music and truly enjoy it. The songs are of a consistent nature, yet with distinct melodies so that they don't drone on together into one mass. They are just unique enough, yet similar enough so that they make good background music without becoming boring or irritating. I recommend it."
2,"Good artist, shoddy merchandising","Actually Ottmar Liebert is one of my favorite artists, but the concept of rereleasing an old CD with 6 extra tracks and one of the tracks on the original omitted is responsible for the 2 star rating. It would have been one star except that I have respect for Ottmar Liebert as an artist. Actually I don't find the special edition quite as moving as the original despite the extra tracks. Partly it is because the new CD starts off with ""Surrender to Love"" instead of the more catchy ""Barcelona Nights"". Anyone with a sense of music appreciation knows that you start off with a fast piece and put the slower more melancholy pieces in the middle, not the other way around. One of the extra tracks, ""La Memoria/Shadows"" is just a rerelease of one of the omitted tracks on the original ""Shadows"" with a different introduction. A good artist is ruined by releases like this."
4,Good news... Bad news...,"The good news is that you have in this CD Ottmar Liebert at his best... the kind of energy he takes from the strings and pass to us is something unbelievable... in terms of flamenco guitar he is a mark. The bad news (at least for me) is that most of the songs are already available in other CDs... If Ottmar Liebert is new for you, buy this CD yesterday..."
4,Gain increased clarity and focus,"Recently I read the book Conzentrate and had to tell you how wonderful it is!As an entrepreneur, business consultant, trainer, writer, and Mom, I am often-times pulled in a thousand different directions simultaneously.Conzentrate gave me a framework to focus and get the most out of each situation and relationship. It is packed with practical techniques for increased effectiveness. I'm looking forward to juggling many projects with greater clarity. You can too!"
3,Not too focused for a book about focusing,"From the cover, almost, you can tell there's a very strong influence of Stephen Covey (7 Habits, First Things First) in this book by Sam Horn. Being a follower of Covey's work this called my attention, but I have to admit the book did not live up to my original expectations. It simply starts to go around giving SO MANY pieces of advice that you end up not quite knowing which one(s) to being following. The idea is good, and the principles of ConZentration are very good, but the book as a whole could have been put together in a much focused way, ironically!"
5,Very good at improving your mind,"This book has made it much easier for me to concentrate when my mind is going a million miles an hour. Also, when my workplace is crazy with noise and distractions, this book has helped me focus."
1,ADD addled author's crackpot book,"I think this book should be subtitled, ""how many quotations from widely disparate souces can I put in my book - and where's my ritalin.""The author's style is a hyperactive, thrusting maniacal prose that made me jittery just from reading a few pages. She jams quote after quote after quote after quote in small easily digestible paragraphs of minor content. Hey, i'm quiting Seneca, then Madonna, then Oprah, then Abe Lincoln...isn't concentrating fun?? There is nothing really new here that you haven't heard better in a dozen other places. It's more of a consolidation of common wisdom, but dispensed by a crack-addict. I truly fear for this woman's sanity..."
1,No real meat hhere! Typical Self-help shallow material,"This is just another typical self-help book with no realsubstance.The title is clever but the book is not.The author does not have a Ph.D or at leastshe doesn't mention her eduactional background.But this book is really for the uneducated masses to consume.Stephen Covey, author of The 7 hoabit of highly effetive peoplerecomends this ""remakrable book. But too bad Coveny's books arepure junk also.Most educated people should find this book simplistic andalmost useless.I increaased my concentration by:1) Doing aerobic exercise for 45 minutes a day.2) Giving up caffein and sugar.3) Sleeping 8+ hours a day3) Just concentrating 3 minutes more at a time.4) Setting small sub-goals.i.e. Just read the next 10 pages of a book instead ofreading the whole book etc."
4,Eyebrow,I saw an ad telling about this eyebrow filler. I have pretty thin and light eyebrows and it works pretty good.
4,More Brows a great product!,I had seen a magazine ad for this product but had trouble finding it for sale in the US. After a search I found this seller's site and product arrived promptly. Works great if you use it as directed. I have very very thin brows and this definitely helps fill them in and looks natural too. Will buy again!
1,No Good,"This is sort of a lacquer with small black fibers. After putting it on my eyebrows, my eyes started to water and burn - I guess due to the chemicals in it. All it did was make my brows look as if I had used a thin black pencil on them. Spend your money elsewhere."
2,This was their first video in the series,"My son likes watching this for about the first 5 minutes..... I think that for their first video it was a good atempt .... but dont go out and buy it, it isnt worth the money. All the other Baby Einstein videos are wonderful though."
4,Baby Neptune,"I only gave this one 4 stars because I don't think this dvd is as good as the others. There are some cute puppets, but they somehow have lost the innocence & simplicity of the older dvds.With that said, my son really does enjoy this dvd. He loves the puppets & babies and laughs while watching the dvd. . . I think he is more enthusiastic about the other dvds, but loves this one as well"
4,Already Impressed,"My daughter is just 2 months old and already has her eyes glued to the screen while this movie is on. It bothers me that I have no clue what they're saying while the movie is playing in other languages but I know my little one is being exposed to other languages and I guess that's what really matters, right? I am anticipating as she grows older she will love it even more, once she recognizes the toys and other assorted items shown during the theater part of the movie. I would recommend this to everyone, it is worth the money."
4,Another Good One!,"Our son really enjoys watching this video...I have a hard time because, of course, I can't understand what they are saying. He watches like he understands though'. All of the Baby Einstein videos we have are very good!"
5,Baby Neptune DVD,"My son LOVES this DVD...We first watched it when he was 6-7 months old and it did not hold his attention like Baby Bach and Baby Mozart did. However, the DVD states 9 months and up so I gave it another try. He LOVES LOVES it---water everywhere...if your child enjoys bathtime I am sure they will love this DVD."
2,Not the best Baby Einstein Video - a review of Baby Einstein Language Nursery,"This is NOT the best Baby Einstein Video of the many that are on the market and I would suggest you buy all of the others before this one. [Particularly good are the early B.E.'s.]Our principal reason to dislike this video is the lack of music which leaves it 'dry' and plainly dull: the readers are not particularly inspired and read in a monotone. Then there are the other odd things that others have commented on, like counting to 20 when the clock only goes to 12. That confused by son who is 2.5 years old and who still loves the Baby Einstein franchise.And I would have thought it would have been more productive to read commonly known nursery rhymes, in tempo, in the various languages... rather than reading heaven's knows what.Save this one for last.Pam T~mom and reviewer for BooksForKids-reviews"
1,Another disappointed parent,Like some of the other reviewers I've been reading I was also disappointed in this video. I think this would have been much better if the visuals related to the audio. Really this might as well be a bunch of random sounds and pictures. I believe it would have been much more enriching if the audio and visual matched so that baby could put the sounds in context.
4,Love 'Em,"Animals, puppet shows, and live action shots. My daughter loves anything about water so this really keeps her attention. The only thing I don't like about this video is that a lot of the puppet shows are shot with white backgrounds and seem overly bright. They are a little hard on the eyes. Other than that it's a good one."
3,My Baby Doesn't like it.,"He loves Baby Motzart, and Baby Monet but this one he doesn't like at all, in fact it scares him. I can't tell you why but this one gets a thumbs down."
4,A little confusing,"My 9 month old baby is not impress with this video, she is not aware of what they are talking about because when the video is mentioning the numbers or the alphabet it does not show anything related to it and it does not says the language that is used in every episode."
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,I was hoping for something to help my son learn his alphabet & numbers in english & spanish. There are no screen views to go along with the alphabet or number recitals. Many of the other parts have nothing to do with what is on the screen. I could have bought a CD instead. Don't waste your money. Time Life has better alphabet videos.
5,Great for up to Crawling stages,"This video is awesome for kids up until they are in the crawling stage, at least my son was that way. The Mozart, Bach, Neighborhood Animals and Shakespeare, are taking him to toddlerhood. Baby Einstein was my shower, dinner, clothes time for the first few months - I knew he was safe and content. A great item to have for the first few months of life."
2,Boring - Try Baby Mozart Instead,"I debated whether or not to buy this video and ended up borrowing it from a friend to try it out. My daughter is 10 months old and loves Baby Mozart and Baby Doolittle. However, Baby Einstein did not hold her attention at all and I found it boring, too. I thought it would be good to expose her to all the foreign languages, but I think she enjoyed the music and visuals on the other tapes better. I would recommend skipping this tape but getting others in the series."
2,Dissapointed in this product,"I have been getting the Baby Einstein DVD's for my grandson since he was born a year ago. He likes them and will watch them as he runs around and plays. He usually stops to watch his favorite parts. This one did not interest him at all. He will stop to look at the movie when they speak either English or Spanish but isn't interested in any of the other languages in the movie. I really endorse the Baby Einstein series, but this one is a dud."
3,baby dvd,it was good my 8 month old enjoyed it but i wasnt aware the majority is in diffrent launges but good pics to entertain babys
3,"Great, But Spare the Self Promotion","I agree with other positive reviews -- our son has been watching this video off and on since he was 3 months (he's now 17 months) and still really enjoys it. However, my wife and I and others we know are both annoyed and disturbed by Aigner-Clark's pitch at the end. First she puts her young daugher on camera and badgers her until she performs a ""peek-a-boo"" trick. She even ""fixes"" her young girl's hair as if preparing her for a Holywood audition -- not a message we want our son to absorb. It feels weird and exploitive and adds nothing of substance to the video. And the next part -- an explaination of how to view the video and the thinking behind it -- is useful but also feels self-promotional. We suggest sticking close by and pressing the ""stop"" button before its tacky and somewhat disturbing epilogue."
2,Weird video...,"My daughter (11 months) LOVES Baby Shakespeare and Baby Bach. We were very disappointed with Baby Einstein. It is slow paced, has boring images and music - she doesn't watch it for more than a few minutes. The weirdest part of all is that while the different voices speak in different languages, what they are saying does not match what is appearing on the screen at all. For instance, someone may be counting to 20 in a language, but only 7 blocks are shown, or the picture and the words don't go together at all - nursery rhymes while showing pictures of a spinning top or a flower or something. If I want my child to become ""familiar"" with foreign languages, regardless of what the person is saying, I'll just take her to our local grocery story to people watch. I'd personally prefer to get a product that teaches my child a foreign language -- AND the meaning of the words."
3,Not for my baby ..,"We have several of these videos, i orderd this one mainly because im wore to death of the other ones, but he hardly pays any attention to this one at all, i thought it was a good choice due to all the water involvement but nope, im going to sell mine or give it away to someone, which ever comes first i guess, i suggest maybe borrowing this movie or finding a mini clip of it before buying, all kids are diffrent tho. good luck ."
1,I don't understand what is this Video all about,"What is this video suppose to be? Images and text don't even connect, it does not catches babies interest... If you want to start your baby with a foreign language you should better try Little Pim series which both catches the baby's attention and is of great educational quality.Little Pim: 3-Disc Gift Set (Spanish)Little Pim: 3-Disc Gift Set (Mandarin Chinese)Little Pim: 3-Disc Gift Set (French)"
5,The best so far...,My 4.5 month old loves this DVD - the music is great and he loves water. He loves the turtle and the duck and all the kids they show. My husband and I enjoy this Baby Einstein also.I say this is the best so far because we are getting Baby Monet for Easter and it might be even better.
4,Top Ten,"Of the things that buy me a moment of peace, this is in the Top 10. I'm not a big TV person and feel a little guilty about putting him in front of the tube, but the B.E. videos are an almost perfect compromise. Baby Neptune gets the most airtime. Some of the scenes feel a little rushed (blip they're there, blip they're gone) and it's barely 30 minutes, but there are no commercials, the music is wonderful, I love the ocean scenes and the aquarium is a peaceful bonus. We got them when our son was 6 mos (now 1 yr) and I can't say he's riveted, but he does enjoy it and has a great deal of fun playing with us and the puppets. Maybe it's not really educational, but it is entertaining and sometimes that's even better."
2,Baby Einstein VHS,"Unfortunately this video is not as captivating to my son as the Baby Mozart Video. The voices are alittle faint and he gets distracted easily when I play it. We were given Baby Mozart video(which included the CD) HE LOVED IT (both:video and CD)...When riding in the car, as soon as it was on he quieted right down! BABY EINSTEIN may be better for him after 12 mos... (I do like the fact that some include the CD's.) I plan on trying the Baby Bach...Sounds like it is more like the Baby Mozart Video."
3,Great concept..but doesn't keep their attention,"My son has loved the Baby Mozart video since he was about a month and 1/2 old, and has also decided that he likes the Baby Bach and Van Gogh vidoes as well. However, he does not seem the least bit interested in Baby Einstein. The pictures/actions are simply not captivating (at least to a 4 month old) and it does not have the music that he loves so much. The poems do not relate to what they are doing on the video, so it would not necessarily help a child make the connection to what they are saying in a different language. I loved the idea of having him hear other languages and may occasionally put this on as background noise, but not to keep his attention. Disappointing, since the other videos are so wonderful."
2,Just okay...,"I thought this DVD was going to be great, but it wasn't all that I had expected. Small babies will find it entertaing because of the bright colors and contrasts in the video, but older babies (and their parents!) will be confused by the language portion of the video. The language portion doesn't match what's shown on the screen, so it really doesn't make sense - however, for exposing your baby to the different *sounds* of other languages, this could be useful. There are some ""flashcards"" in the bonus section of the video that I think are helpful for older babies. Final thought: not our #1 favorite Baby Einstein video, but add it to your collection if you 1) have a tiny fussy baby (fussy/colicy babies love Baby Einsteins - don't ask me why!) or 2) have all the videos and want to finish your collection."
2,Baby Einstein Language Nursery DVD,My least favorite BE video. Rather boring and not very captivating. I was hopeful due to my teaching our son spanish--but it bores me to death. My grandmother actually threatened to kill me if I made her sit through it again!
1,It grows on ya,"After loving most of the wonderful B.E. DVD's, we finally came across one that was not an immediate hit. At first when we tried to show this one to our two-year-old, she actually walked way - and that's NEVER happened with any of the others! However, after several attempts, she decided that the duck, octopus and turtle were lots of fun - oh and the water stuff is kind of interesting too! Now it's in the rotation with Galileo, Van Vogh and Shakespeare. And I'd change my rating to 3 stars, but I don't seem to have that option at this stage."
1,WAYYY OVERrated,"This product is so incredibly overrated. My child is more entertained watching commercials. After I saw this video I was convinced that parents buy Baby Einstein products for the name rather than the quality of the product. ""Baby Einstein"".. so alluring..Good marketing on Baby Einstein's behalf. I tried it so many times all the way up to now that she is 9 1/2 months.. she doesn't watch it for more than a minute or 2. I really can't understand everyone's fascination with it. Its so poorly and cheaply made. I can just show her toys and put on international radio stations from the inernet to expose her to other languages... for that matter.. I could do that in front of a video camera, call it Baby Genius and sell it.. it wouldn't be much different from this Video."
4,Great movie,"My son loves this video. He is 7 months old and loves to explore his surroundings. The video is silly, with lots of puppets interacting with real children, but it works. He loves to see the ocean and the water around the house. We think its a great movie, not his favorite in the collection, but a great movie."
2,Boring to My 9 Month Old,"I'm glad I only checked this DVD out from the library and I never spent money on it. My daughter absolutely loves the Neighborhood Animals Baby Einstein DVD that she's been watching since she was 4 months old. But when I played this one for her at 9 months old she couldn't have cared less. I found this interesting, given that Neptune is for 9 mos. and up, while Neighborhood Animals is for 1 yr. and up. I thought the younger movie would hold her attention more, since she was younger. I too found Baby Neptune to be boring. It's got the nice music and pretty imagery, but it is lacking the pazzazz other Baby Einstein movies have."
2,Another baby scared by the goldfish!,I actually came on here to see if my son was the only one who burst into tears when the goldfish came on (he's 10 1/2 months)! He does startle easily though and perhaps that is what's going on. I had left the room for a second when it began and came running back when he started screaming. Daddy accidentally sent Baby Mozart back to Netflix (instead of his Star Trek DVD) so we were branching out into our Baby Einstein collection. I think we'll put this one away and try some of the others.
1,Baby Einstein: Language Nursery,My 18 month old loves every other Baby Einstein video she has (5 altogether) but shows no interest at all in this one. Ended up giving it to the Goodwill. Don't bother with this one.
1,not as good as the others--parents examine your motivation,"I love the other Baby Einstein videos. This video is really more for parents than for babies--I think it makes parents feel good about themselves--that they're culturally aware and trying to stimulate an interest in other languages in their children. This was given to me and my baby as a gift. It was truthfully rather dull. If I as a parent do not speak another language, my child is not going to magically gain the ability to understand another language by watching/listening to this video. Maybe a preschool child would benefit from this video, but what do people think, that somehow by osmosis or subliminal messages, their 4 month old is going to become a whiz at other languages? Again, I love the other Einstin videos, especially the animal video, and I find the music is very relaxing. But I think this video is all about being trendy."
2,Not very interesting for young babies,I was very disappointed in the particular Einstein DVD; my son loses interest within the first few minutes. There isn't much music and the words are spoken very softly and difficult to hear. For the amount of money for DVD's I would stay away from this one.
1,"Baby Mozart, Baby Bach, and Baby Shakespeare are better","I will be honest. Our son loves Baby Mozart, Baby Bach, and Baby Shakespeare. The music on them is delightful and the videography is great. The toys and objects are shot in such a way that they get a baby's and toddler's attention. But, I find that they are not as mesmerizing as the Barney, Elmo, etc. TV stuff is.Now, for Baby Einstein. The concept is good, but in execution, it didn't work for our son. Listening to moms speak in a dozen languages bored our son. And the videography is not well done, so the images don't get a child's attention. This was the first tape in the series; the others are far better. We ended up consigning this tape. But, I am about to buy the new Baby Van Gogh, so I really do like the products from this company--just not this particular tape."
3,Baby Einstein - Language Nursery,It is OK but not up to the level of rest of the Baby Einstein series. Not having any book to follow along meant often not being able to repeat the words or follow what was being said.
3,it's ok...not my favorite,"I had purchased Baby Mozart for my 4th child when he was 6 months old. He always enjoyed this video. When my 5th child was born we shared the video with her. She enjoyed it with the same enthusiam as her brother did. At 9 months I decided she needed some more of these videos...some variety. I selected Baby Einstein next. I really didn't compare it to all of the others before purchase...I wish I had. We enthusiastically put it in and my daughter did not react as enthusiastically as she always had with Baby Mozart. The language was boring in comparison to all the music and unique sounds on Baby Mozart. Immediately we purchased Baby Bach and my daughter was delighted! We alternate between Baby Bach and Baby Mozart, which are similar, but different. Ocasionally I will put Baby Einstein in for a change of pace. After reading the various reviews, I look forward to receiving other videos in the series to give my children a wider range of variety."
2,Doesn't work for us,"We truly use our videos as education tools, watching the videos with our girls and then following them up with books or games about the subject we've watched that day. But with this video I can't understand what they are saying so I space out and lose interest. Which, I believe, is not beneficial to our girls. See if you can watch someone elses version or check it out from the library before you buy it."
1,eh,"not too happy with this one, it's hard enough trying to teach them one language, but to try and introduce it to an 11 month old, he won't sit down for this one either, so most definetly wait till the kid is older"
2,Wheres the english?,maybe my Dvd was messed up but the only english I heard was one old mcdonald farm song and hello! I even went to the part where theres a list of all the languages i selected english then would hit play I would here hello then the rest of the video was in another language. Everything else was in a different language. While I do understand why people think it looked homemade I guess it was trying to capture the babies view of the world. i like the sounds and graphics just more english. I do want to expose my 4 month old son to other languages but english is going to be his first language and this video could have had more but its good for him to just watch for now.
5,Wonderful Alternative to TV,"My infant son loves the Baby Einstein dvds, including this one. It makes for a great break, calm down moment before nap time. He sits in his sliding glider with a bottle of water or juice and watches the dvd. He isn't passive, he's talking back to the images and lauging. After this he slips off to nap. We've used Baby Bach, Baby Monet and now this one since he was about 4 months old. (We watched the signing video before he was born and since.) These videos are fifteen minutes for mom or dad to make it to the restroom or just relax. And you don't have to worry about what he's seeing or hearing."
3,Doesnt compare to the rest,"I'm not sure what the point of the various languages is. For an infant, it's just unusual noises he won't hear again, or often. For an older child, it's probably confusing, even frustrating. And the images on this release simply don't compare to the wonder, rhythm, or photography of the others in the series. The idea behind this one's a bit kitchy. If you want your kid to learn a language, do that separately, in some other fashion."
1,really really boring.,"I bought this DVD last year, because my son loved baby mozart and baby shakespeare. But, he didn't even look at it for two seconds.Now, he's 23 months old and still doesn't like it.It has boring contents and pictures in foreign languages. I'm not sure whether my son might like it 2 years later.."
2,Baby Einstein Makes Muppet Babies,"This DVD fails. Baby Einstein doesn't even appear. Sure, Pinwheel had personality. But just when his story got good, Strobing Light took over. If I want to watch Strobing Light, I'll stick to Pokemon thank you!Best ever!"
1,Read before purchasing,"I wish I did! I love the Einstein series, but this one was an eye opener! Very confusing, hard to understand, poorly put together. My daughter became bored and I... I just turned it off! If I could return it I would.See the other reviews, but I'd rate this at the least of the two."
4,A video that stimulates baby's listening skills,"My brother bought my daughter this tape when she was 9 months old and I wish that I had had it when she was born. Sixteen different languages are spoken (random nursery rhymes, the alphabet, numbers, etc. are recited) as various toys and everyday objects are shown. I found it strange at first, but my child was visibly drawn to it from the beginning. The only critism I have is that I am doubtful that the voices are spoken by native speakers as the video claims. My husband is French and he's sure that the voice speaking French does not belong to a native speaker. I don't know about the other languages but it leaves me wondering. Another remark is that once your child becomes mobile, her interests change very quickly and you shouldn't expect her to sit through the entire 30 minutes of the video. Nonetheless, watching the video with her and commenting on it can help her to develop her vocabulary."
2,"Great Concept, but not very interesting","The Baby Einstein series has a few engaging videos for infants that don't have education in mind, and, they have this video that has education in mind but is not very entertaining. I applaud the courage to try this concept in America, and I believe it started a whole new trend in baby videos. I thank Julie Clark for that, although I with my youngest, I've foregone an introduction to the Baby Einstein videos after trying them with my 2 year old.I also don't believe in putting children in front of the television at the suggested age group. An infants eyesight doesn't develop until 4 months old, and this should have been taken into consideration in its making and marketing. With all the newer videos that just came out, like the Baby Know-It-All series (absolute favorites for both toddlers) and Bilingual Baby's more targeted language associations, I find that Baby Einstein is not a great buy."
1,Unstimulating for my baby,"After about 5 minutes of watching this video, my 5 month old appeared to be bored and started whining. The objects on the screen weren't animated enough for her and she quickly lost interest. She loves lots of movement, activity and music but this video was much slower paced and not right for her.I personally thought it was neat that the video was in different languages but the sounds did not capture her interest. She prefers more upbeat and faster-paced music/sounds."
5,My daughter's favorite,My daughter loves Baby Neptune. Repeat play gives her hours of entertainment. She is probably a bit spoiled; she is our first and we have every possible educational video and toy for infants. This has been her favorite since about 15 weeks. The bright colors and mix between animation and real ocean scenes is perfect. I hope you all enjoy as much as we have.
1,baby bored- not representative of the series,"this is 1 of 5 baby einstien videos we have and the only one we don't like. Even though I noticed within the first 2 minutes that it was unlikely to 'teach' Sammy anything, I tried to be objective (because this time daddy was the one to choose it). And I suppose Ms. Clark's purpose was to EXPOSE babies to different languages, after all, teaching is really the parent's job. but this one seemed confusing- maybe just to me- Sam doesn't know that all those sounds aren't just sounds. I do find him imitating some of the inflections in the video as if he's trying to carry on a conversation in whatever language he thinks grown-ups speak, just as he imitates some of the sound effects in the other videos. I stand by the BE line- we enjoy all the other videos we've seen. And we do still use this one, but mainly to get Sam to take a nap."
3,Language Nursery,"Not my favorite, but good just the same. A bit too advanced for a child age 0 to 3 months."
1,My child hated this one!,"My child cries when I put this one in. He hates the animated dancing crayons. Let me just say that these movies have such an appeal to babies because, in the exact words of Julie Clark, ""they capture the sights and sounds of baby's real world."" I don't know about you, but there are no computer animated, singing and dancing crayons in my child's real world. I think Disney forgot that the simplicity of these movies is what makes them so loveable. Pass on this one and stick with the earlier versions (before Disney took over)My child adores Bach, Mozart and both the Dolittles."
2,not as good as baby mozart or bach,"this video is a lot more boring than baby mozart or bach, because those have music and this does not. this one is just voice-overs in different languages and doesn't hold our child's attention as much. if you really think hearing all the different languages as an infant will make your child smarter later, go ahead, otherwise I thought the musical ones were much more interesting."
1,SKIP THIS ONE...Buy the others,"When my daughter (now 13 months old) was 2 months old, I bought the 10 pack of Baby Einstein videos. They've been great - its the only way to get a 30 minute break in the day and she loves them with the exception of this one. She can't watch more than 30 seconds of it without being bored and crawling away. And I can't say I blame her - it speaks in other languages, but doesn't translate, there's no way of knowing what language is being spoken at what time or what they are saying. If its confusing to an adult, what baby would get any value from it? The other Baby Einstein videos are ingenious, and I HIGHLY recommend them for fun and for learning. But skip this one unless your baby is interested in nonsense."
3,Luke warm Review,"I give this DVD a luke warm review. It is certainly not the same caliber as Baby Mozart or even Baby Beethoven.My son was not as thrilled to view it, personally I think they should have added more puppetry than computer graphics.I could have even dealt with seeing Aspen and Sierra (who, by the way are not in this) than I could deal with spotting the ""hidden mickeys"" or the not so subtle shot of Epcot.Unfortunately, the Baby Einstein magic has been lost by Disney."
1,"irritating, boring",My son was bored to death the first and last time he watched. I went nuts listening to all the babble. Don't waste your money!
2,Not too great...,"I purchased this video along with all the others for my daughter's age (4 months) and was not at all pleased with this one-Baby Einstein: Language Nursery. My daughter will not watch this for more than three minutes, then she loses interest very quickly. It's jyst not like the other tapes and all the language combonations are rater annoying to the adult ear. Perhaps a tape like this in one other language, or up the age recommendations on this one to ages 2-5."
3,Not as good as Baby Noah (at least for me),Product arrived fast and in terrific condition. This video only holds my 8 month year old's attention for about 5 minutes. The only video he really sits and watches start to finish is Baby Noah.
5,4 month old loves it,"HIS favorite baby einstein dvd so far.... I've had a few friends tell me that their boys loved it and their girls didn't.... (he loves the xmas one too, lots of sparkle things)"
2,Disappointed in this one...,"I bought Baby Einstein for my 9-month-old and was very disappointed with it -- it's going back to the store in exchange for Baby Mozart! My daughter has Baby Bach and loves it, all the music and sounds and activity really fascinate her, so I had high hopes for the Baby Einstein video. But we found that the extremely slow pace, lack of music, and simplistic images in Baby Einstein were boring to her. I suppose it depends on your child's personality, and it might be great for younger babies, but our active girl wasn't interested at all."
3,For older babies,"I have to agree with the most recent review. This video was my least favorite of the entire series. Julie Clark has chosen to mark this video from birth to eighteen months, but I disagree. My son did not take interest in this video until 9 months. He is now nineteen months and his interest in it has grown as he has gotten older. Although I consider Julie Clark a brillant woman for creating this video series, I think she should have used a professional voice-over for the American segments rather than her own voice. Her voice lacks ""umph"" and comes across as boring and unstimulating. The other voices in this video, although none of them are professional voice artists, are at least soothing and stimulating to the ear."
3,"My kids like it, but...","We have all the Baby Einstein videos, and my kids like them, but they weren't as interested in this one as previous releases. Compared with some of the newer options on the market (like the Baby Laureate tapes), the Einstein puppets are starting to look a little old-school."
2,I wish i had listened to other reviews on this product!!!!,"This has to be the most boring video for kids!!! I Love all the other einstein videos but this one was a miss, not a hit!!I wish I would have listened to the reviews from other parents .About two minutes into the video ,my 18 month -old just gets up and walks away,as with the others, she's completely mezmorized .Nice concept though, but to all parents ,please listen to these reviews, or you'll waste your money!!!"
1,confusing,This dvd was very confusing. My three kids are big fans of baby eistein. It has way too many languages. Doesn't make sence.
2,Not so great as other Baby Einstein products,I don't complain about this DVD too much but I'd rather use other ones that are more fun and educational. It's just OK but I always end up using the other ones. This one is not in my top list.
3,Kind of boring...,"I expected more! If you want a dvd to catch your baby's eyes buy Baby Neptune or Van ""goat"". This one is certainly not that amazing..."
2,Eeeww.. hated it,"My baby does like this video, but I can't stand it. I first purchased Baby Mozart and Baby Beethoven and liked them a lot, but when my daughter got older (6 months) I decided to try something new. So I bought her some of the Fisher Price videos. She loves them, and I do too. Then I decided to try this video because unlike Mozart and Beethoven they actually have nature scenes and stuff in this video. My daughter is entertained, but the way they try to make the kids in this video all ""cutesy"" is annoying. The kids in the Fisher Price videos are very cute. They're filmed doing many different activities, playing with moms and dads, sleeping, eating. Very cute. But the kids in this video are always mugging for the camera - a complete turn-off for me. So, I gave this video two stars because it definitely entertains my daughter. But only two stars because I can't stomach it myself."
1,Annoying for adults - boring for baby,"When I first played this, I thought I had purchased a foreign copy because it starts speaking another language which I can only guess is German. I dont like the fact that you dont know what they are saying or in what language. I found it incredibly annoying and my 5 mo. old baby isn't interested in it either. She usually sits captivated during other Baby Einstein videos from beginning to end (except for Baby Newton, which scares her). I do not recommend this one."
2,this video is so boring!,"My daughter is 11 months old & loves Baby Van Gogh, and both Baby Doolittle tapes. However, in comparison this video is dull with slow music and is more appropriate if you want you child to nap. It also has very little educational value & was truly a disappointment. Don't waste your money, like I did, just because it's a Baby Einstein tape!"
3,OK,"I was excited to buy this from a friends recommendation. Our daughter did seem mildly interested at first, but it is VERY slow paced and I really don't think much of the other languages on the DVD. There is german, jewish (?!) and a few others. I think there are better products out there!"
1,Leaves out the Italian language!,"I am very disappointed in Baby Einstein. This video has several different languages, none of which were Italian! I even wrote a letter to Baby Einstein expressing my disappointment. I think that Italian is a beautiful language that many people wish to learn and to leave it out of this video is unforgivable. I no longer support Baby Einstein products."
1,Not the greatest for language learning,"I speak two other languages besides english and at first was excited to see a language baby einstein but disappointed upon seeing it. If you want your child to learn a second language do not expect this video to help. The poems do not coincide with the pictures flashing across the screen hence, you do not know what the poems are about unless you can speak the language. I think it was poorly done. I love almost all the other videos I have seen thus far as does my two year old and 7 mo. old however I would not purchase the language nursery. Hopefully they will come out with a better video teaching kids different languages."
2,Hit or Miss,"My son never showed any interest in the Baby Einstein (Mozart, Bach, etc) series. Though we exposed him to it a few times, it rarely kept his interest for more than 3 or 4 minutes (if that long).He was much more interested with watching a tape showing baby faces and their expressions. He'd sit through that entire tape.I think the Baby Einstein concept is good but I think it is hit and miss with each individual child."
1,Don't waste your money,"I have the whole series of their products. This is the worst. My daughter loves the others but this one is simply boring. I agree with some of the other reviewers that is purposeless to not have the images correlate with what is being spoken. My daughter resides in a multi-lingual home and we are careful to match what we say to her with what is going on around her. To not do this is worthless. Poor product, trust me don't get this one."
3,Daughter likes it but couple problems,"My daughter seems to like this dvd, though not as much as the Baby Mozart and Beethoven dvds. (She's 6 months).The timing of the video could be faster, they stay on static subjects too long.My biggest problem with this dvd is that the objects they show don't really have anything to do with what is being said. I find it a odd that they don't show things that correlate with what is being talked about (whether the language is English or foreign)."
4,Danielle,"My baby loves watching this movie. We speak English and German at home. This is a fun movie to try and figure which language is playing. My baby enjoys trying to make sounds she hears on the tv. This isn't a movie to teach your baby to speak languages, but rather to teach your baby to make various sounds that they may not hear on a normal basis. This movie is lots of fun to watch with your baby."
2,Generally dissapointing,"Wonderful photography, as always, but it would be nice if they had included a word-for-word translation booklet so parents could translate."
1,Warning- This video scares my toddler,"My toddler loves the B.E. collection, but for some reason is petrified of the goldfish that pops out in the beginning and the end of the video. I had first showed him the video when he was 11 months old, and he burst out in sobs (this had never happened before with anything else). I waited a few months and again- same thing. I was ready to throw it out, when I just showed it to him again (19 months). He clings to me and once the goldfish is gone, he is fine with the video... until it reappears. The sobs have stopped, though. Is it worth it? I don't think so."
2,What's The Worth In It?,"My 14 month old son loves the Baby Einstein series. They've been the only movies to hold his attention. The sounds and music get his attention, the shapes and colors hold it.That said, this movie never got or held his attention. There are no interesting sounds or music. The voices are very monotone. While I understand the intention of this video, if you don't catch the attention of the child, what's the worth in it? The pictures on the screen do not corrolate well with what is being said. I also believe that there is value in learning not only foreign languages, but foreign cultures. If I knew what was being said when nursery rhymes or poems are recited, I could repeat them in english as an additional learning tool. All around, this move was disappointing."
1,BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My 13 month old son loves Baby Mozart, Baby Bach and Baby Beethoven. I thought this was going to be in the same league. Unfortunately, it's as boring as Baby Einstein's Language Nursery. He had no interest in watching this. Lots of repitition and the music isn't that great. I wouldn't bother with this one."
2,disappointing,"i was disappointed with this childrens dvd. It is nice that they are trying to get childrens minds moving and teach them things i just feel it can be done better. for example they say the abc and count to 20 in 7 different languages which is good but they don't show the numbers or letters while they are saying them, there is pretty much a blank screen. Also if you view the short theatre part of the dvd they are saying thing while objects are being shown ( stuff animals, toys etc) but the things they are saying dont relate to the pictures at all. One thing that was very upsetting to me was that one of the objects they display are burning candles not a picture of burning candles like on a cake just actual burning candles i think it is uncalled for and could be teaching children to be interest in fire. this was very disappointing"
4,overall a good buy,"i found the video to be quite simple and home-made, but my almost 7 month old seems to enjoy it. it holds her attention very well. and i like that it's atleast got some educational value."
1,Misrepresentation,"Video not in English! It had English writing on the cover, but the entire DVD is in wvery other language except English."
2,The first disappointing Baby Einstein video,"My 14 month old daughter loves all of the Baby Einstein videos. She is enthralled with all of the ones we have, so I was excited to buy this one. She watched it for 2 minutes and walked away. She has no interest in this one, while the others we have to watch ALL of it including the credits each time."
4,"Different than the others, but not bad...","We own quite a few of the Baby Einstein series, so when I saw this in the store last week, I scooped it up, thinking 'wow, we've not seen this one before!'. While the theme is clever and it's a neat concept, this one did not seem to have as much attention grabbing music and viewables as some of its predecessors.Since my daughter is now 9 months old and loves to play in the tub, I thought this would be a big hit. She does enjoy Baby Neptune and will continue to watch it, but it's not as 'wow' as I thought it might be. I do like the fact that there is an 'aquarium' selection on the DVD, which was kind of neat, but all in all, we'll take Baby Van Gogh or Baby Mozart, if given a choice."
4,Use it as a learning tool!,"The first time I sat my son down to watch this DVD, he lost interest in just a couple of minutes from hitting play. Until I sat down with him and explained and went over everything with him, he actually had watched it with me. It's very bright, musical, and educational but you'd have to take part in it if you'd want to teach your child something. If you plan to have more children then it's worth buying but if you're unsure, try buying it used or borrow it from a friend or relative. It'll last you for a year from birth, maybe two years but after your child recognizes Barney or Blues Clues, it'll be boring and unentertaining to them."
3,Okay but not great,"The video was just okay - I don't think my daughter picked up any words. The other Baby Einstein videos are better and kept her attention longer. If you want your kid to learn or become used to hearing a foreign language, I recommend the Bilingual Baby series or, even better, just plain songs without the damaging effects of television -- my girl really likes the Global Village Kids Sing and Learn CDs (bilingual nursery rhymes in French, German and Spanish). They are more educational."
2,Baby Neptune,"Don't waste your money on this one. Believe me, my baby and I LOVE all the videos we have seen in the Baby Einstein series, but this one has to be the most boring one! The footage is great and the puppets are cute, but it just isn't that exciting to watch. It might be good to watch it just before a nap because I certainly felt like taking one during it!"
1,Please skip this one!!!!!!!!!!!,"I chose language nursery to introduce my baby to the einstein tapes. What a bad choice. Who knows what they are saying? The visuals are boring at best, the music is the only thing keeping you awake. My baby hated this from the start. Yet, I did not lose hope and I bought baby Mozart and bingo!! She likes the Mozart much much better and so do I."
1,Not good for us!,"We have 8 Baby Einstein series VHS tapes and this is the only one that my son doesn't like. He usually stays glued to the TV when the other videos are playing, but with this one he's off to play in 30 seconds. It doesn't hold his attention at all."
1,this is the odd ball in an otherwise great series.,"i dont like this & would advise against buying it.The counting part is simply someone 'counting to 20. No pictures of numbers (this also applies to the alphabet) with the sound, making it hard for babies to relate from the 'english A to eg Spanish A. SAVE YOUR MONEY, flash cards would be far cheaper & better in this case."
2,Doesn't correlate,"I love the other Baby Einstein tapes,(my 5 month old loves Mozart & Bach so far) and I recently ordered a few more. The language Nursery is interesting, but it doesn't always correlate the words and ""nursery rhymes"" with what is on the screen. That seems like it would be confusing for a baby/toddler. For instance, if saying little miss muffit, you would expect something to be shown that is associated with that nursery rhyme. Much of this tape does not do that."
1,BORING BORING BORING,"My 3 month old & I are big fans of BE DVDs BUT this one is just not one of them. I gatta say it is very boring & not suitable for a baby. Maybe a toddler. My son started watching BE Dvds from 2 months (Beethoven, Mozart) & he loves them, laughing and all. He usually gets into them from 45 min to an hour. The second I put this DVD in, he started crying. I tried to fast forward to find something that would be interesting, colorful, or some music. Didnt happen all you hear is numbers & numbers in different languages. Maybe when hes about 2 but not now or anytime soon."
2,Very Boring and Dull,"I normally just love the baby einstein series, but this one was very disappointing. It had the same images more then a couple times, and my son got bored of it very early. It doesn't teach your child new languages, but exposes them to it. However, my son was only interested when the english parts were on. I would recommend baby macdonald; that one is the best one I've seen. But don't waste your money on this!"
3,it's ok,"Like many here have already stated, I believe this is not the best Baby Einstein video. My children bore easily when watching it...probably because they have no idea what is being said. I think it could be made better by having either subtitles in English or by having the sub-titles in the language that is being spoken. At least then the parents would be able to help the children understand better."
2,Baby needs to be older,"Being multinlingual parents, we wanted to expose our 5 months old daughter to multiple languages as well. As it turned out, she was totally disinterested in the program.I think it would probably be more interesting for older children. Though, a colleague of mine with 18 months old twins said that they weren't interested in the Language Nursery either."
1,NOT a good one at all,My 9 month old daughter who loooooves Baby Eienstein videos totally hates this one. I don't know why but this one simply was a total waste of money. Whatever their formula is that makes babies love these videos was lost on this one. It is well known among other moms that this is the one to stay away from.
1,Terrible Product,"This is really a bad product. Our 4 month old daughter was completely disinterested. It is visually unstimulating and poorly thought out. It would be nice to know what they are saying in the different languages. My wife and I are multilingual and did not find the choice of languages to be helpful. Don't waster your money here, you are better off buying a book and reading to your child."
1,not appealing to the ears,"I was very disappointed with this tape. I own many others which incorporate music with pictures, but this tape did not make any sense. Since I (the parent) sit with my child while watching tv, the baby einstein company could at least match up the language with the picture. The languages seemed to pierce my eardrums like the volume was off between the music and voice. I didn't understand why there would be a poem being spoken with the background of three lines. It never held either my attention or my childs. I actually got restless waiting for my computer to print out the translation from the cd. I returned it the next day and bought neighborhood animals instead. It seems we do better with the other tapes that have music and animation. That keeps the interest of my child. Better luck next time I guess."
3,does not play in the portable dvd player :(,"the contents of any baby einstein is amazing! However, it is not playing in the portable dvd player, so my son cannot watch..."
3,Not as good as the others,"I bought this DVD for my nephew because we are big fans of the Baby Einstein products. However, he does not seem to enjoy it nearly as much as some of the others. I'm bilingual so I thought it would be great for him to be exposed to more than one language, but the video just doesn't hold his attention. I would recommend the ""On the Go"" DVD over any other."
2,Big Disappointment,"I was excited to expose my baby to baby einstein so I tried this video first. While the images got my baby's attention for the whole 30 minutes, I was concerned about the language confusion. Not only the language and images are sometimes not related, but I think that mixing so many languages can be confusing for a baby who's trying to figure out language.I'll try baby mozart and see how my baby responds to it."
2,Not the best Baby Einstein Video - a review of Baby Einstein Language Nursery,"196 Reviews Say It All... This is not the best Baby Einstein Video of the many that are on the market and I would suggest you buy all of the others before this one. Particularly good are the early B.E.'s.Our principal reason to dislike this video is the lack of music which leaves it 'dry' and plainly dull: the readers are not particularly inspired and read in a monotone. Then there are the other odd things that others have commented on, like counting to 20 when the clock only goes to 12. That confused by son who is 2.5 years old and who still loves the Baby Einstein franchise.And I would have thought it would have been more productive to read commonly known nursery rhymes, in tempo, in the various languages... rather than reading heaven's knows what.Save this one for last.Pam T~mom and reviewer for BooksForKids-reviews"
2,Not the best of the Baby Einstein videos,"My baby absolutely adores the Baby Beethoven and Baby Mozart videos, so we thought he would love this one as well. He doesn't, and neither do we. The images are less interesting than other Baby Einstein videos and the music is not very engaging. I would not recommend this one."
2,Not the best of Baby Einstein,"I love the Baby Einstein movies--my 21-month old has watched them since he was a few months old. This one has random words and sentences (poetry?) in different languages that have nothing to do with the visuals. It also has counting and alphabets spoken in several languages--again, with no relation to the visuals. My son is at an age where he needs recognizable words he can repeat and relate to what he sees. Perhaps it would be fine for a younger child but I think this one is just weird."
4,Soothing and visually enthralling,"This video is not as educational as other BE videos have been, but we still enjoy watching it. I usually put this one in when it is time to get ready for a nap or bedtime. The animals are fun to watch and we both enjoy the visual images of the different kinds of bodies of water. Not every video we watch has to be 100% educational in order to have value."
2,Very Disappointed,"We and our baby love the Baby Einstein DVDs (Bach, Mozart, Nursery & Van Gogh). I wish we had not bought this one. It is not interesting to watch, lacks innovation and charm. The story and music even seem to hack Baby Van Gogh.I did notice that Julie Aigner-Clark (and kids) are absent on this one...is she not involved in production anymore? Maybe that is the difference. Unfortunately, I will never buy a B.E. DVD again without reading the reviews in advance!"
1,First bad DVD in the Baby Einstein,"My daughter loves all her Baby Einstein DVDs and as soon as this new one came out, I went out to buy it for her. She wasn't even interested in it from the very first time we played it for her. Thinking that she needs to get used to the DVD, we played it again and she just wanted entertained by this one like the others. As a parent who bought the whole set of Baby Einstein when I was 3 month pregnant (that's how enthused I was with the product) I'm very disappointed with this new DVD."
2,Fairly upset.,I got this as a gift and we put it in thinking there would be a section with just English for him and there wasnt. I have no idea what most of the languages are. He disliked it. I want him to know other languages but I also want to know what he is hearing. I am sure for Multi-Lingual people this is a great buy but dont waste your money if you want to know what it is teaching your child.
3,So So Sirens,"I appreciate good jazz vocals; but, these are just ok jazz vocals, with big name singers. I guess I had expected the songs to be cleaned up a bit - you know digitally perfect. While there are a lot of wonderful songs here, by most of the original performers, that does not make them the best versions of the songs. Unfortunately the feel of the songs gradually goes from lounge jazz (good) to early Doo-whop (just ok). Still, if you're in the mood for some historic / nostalgic performances by the first first ladies of music, there is a place in your collection for this disk. I personally enjoyed Judy Garland's: But Not For Me.The one other thing about the CD I didn't care for was the marketing technique used. It is an honorable thing to support shelters for battered women; however, it is not necessary to employ subtle, emotional male-bashing in the liner notes. Our two genders will never achieve equality, if they can't treat each other with respect and consideration."
5,Great songs; great singers;great singing.,"I fell in love, all over again, with these wonderful singers. This is as good as it gets! Listen to it and you'll fall as hard as this reviewer."
2,"VERY cute, but very cheaply made","This was just what my daughter, age 7, wanted. And it IS cute. But it's CHEAP. Cheap product, cheap construction, cheap overall. It cost much more than it's worth. But for the LPS lover, it'll probably still make them happy."
4,Good basic book of motor/generators,"If you need an engineering introduction into generators, motors, transformers, and the likes this book is good. The illustrations not only show simplistic diagrams but actual machines one will find in the job. Has solved examples and end of chapter questions. Covers a lot of ground but delivers the concepts well."
3,"Short explanations, a lot of examples","This is a great book if you are taking a course involving Electric Machines. I usually read a chapter or part of it before my class, and it is quite difficult to understand everything, mainly because this book assumes you actually know a lot about electric circuits. I'd always wait until my class to listen to my teacher's explanation, who knows a lot about this book. I would recommend this only if you have previously taken courses about electricity and magnetism, or if you have a teacher that can answer your doubts."
5,Should be required reading.,"This book should be required reading in every high school. Before you spend 25 grand for a car spend $10.00 on this book. If not for you, for your kids. Basic, easy to understand information that will help you your whole life."
2,Too Generic,"This book doesn't shed any new light on the inner workings of the dealerships back room. While the How To aspect was interesting, what we need is a book that goes a lot deeper into the underhanded practices of the business."
5,Well worth it....really works!,"I have worked as a Chemist in Pharmaceutical Manufacturing for about four years and have always had an interest in Pharmaceutical Sales. Lack of sales experience had been a major setback in landing a Pharmaceutical Sales position until I purchased this book. After completing the three day course, and realizing there were ways to get around lack of sales experience, I landed five interviews with top Pharmaceutical Companies such as Aventis, Novartis, First Horizon, GSK and Berlex labs.Interviews went well and I recently accepted a position as a Pharmaceutical Sales Consultant with Berlex Labs. I wanted to encourage anyone and everyone with a drive to purchase this book. Well worth the money and it really works!Best regards,Brent"
2,"Good, but could have been better . . .","This was a fine book and had some good ideas, but there was just too much fluff. Also, it was a more expensive that it really needed to be. [...]"
3,Ogdon Not AT His Best,"This CD set is definitely only for hardcore John Ogdon afficianados...and then maybe not even for them. As a pianist myself, I am well aware of the difficulties in this repetoire and can empathize with Ogdon's difficulties with these works as it was post-breakdown. Ogdon, for those who don't know, suffered from extreme schizophrenia and had a complete breakdown and hospitalization in the mid-1970s. He was never the same after that and the medication he took caused severe difficulties with his motor reflexes.Look, I, for one, am appreciative of having these recordings, as though they may not be the best representation of Ogdon's abilities and prowess pre-breakdown, they still give in many places remnants of his former interpretative and technical greatness.Please, though, if you are not a die-hard Ogdon fan, don't even THINK about investing in these recordings as they ARE substandard in quality."
5,LOVE these!,"Boy are these a surprising find! I picked up a bag of these at Christmas when they were marked down, not having any idea what I would do with them but since they were almost free, well.... Anyway, you HAVE to try the oatmeal cinnamon cookie recipe on the back. It is totally awesome! They make a zillion, literally. You can bake a batch for your family and still have enough to give to a neighbor. They are NOT those hard, nasty, crumby crunchy things either. Not by a long shot. They're just so soft and chewy, moist, ahhh. You gotta LOVE Hershey! This is the one weird item that we, the forgotten people in Ohio, can get at the grocery on a regular basis, depending on where you shop.However, if you're looking to make something like cinnamon bread, these are not your guys. They won't produce that thick line of cinnamon that the recipes require, but are more made for accents to holiday items, cookies and cupcakes. Great, great item, a nice change from chocolate. Highly recommend!"
1,False Advertisement,"This product is listed as ""A4 paper, 8.25x11.7"", however it is standard 8.5x11 paper and this company claims not to know how it listed wrong. The seller doesn't carry A4 paper."
1,sappy silly disappointing,"I wanted a good cd to accompany Buckwheat Zydeco in my sons collection. With the starpower that this cd's artists have, I was expecting much more. The songs would be good if the arrangements were less candy coated and more gritty and more like the guitar driven blues that my son loves.Buckwheat Zydeco is the lone bright spot on the disc. I only wish I could return it to get a different disc but instead, it is a drink coaster for a sipper cup. over and out"
4,Toddler likes the blues,"My toddler likes the music on this CD. When I first heard it, I wasn't sure it would go over well---my husband is not crazy about the music---but my 2 year old likes it! The songs are catchy and the music is nice and easy listening."
2,Not the best out there,"I'm not really thrilled with this CD. It just doesn't have a great blues feel to it and is very flat. Even my daughter asks me to change it whenever I put it on, and she is usually easy to please music-wise. I'd suggest buying another CD for kids, like any from Music for Little People. The best of these are ""I'm a Little Teapot,"" (for the younger crowd) and ""Cajun Music for Kids, Papillion."""
1,A Borefest :o(,"I really, really tried to like this book. One of my favorite and beloved novelists, Iris Murdoch, adored it, and so I ordered it. Ouch, what a dreadful mistake! It was like reading James Joyce, a complete slog all the way through. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't like being spoon fed, but please, this was absolute TORTURE. Thank goodness I bought this through a seller for $2.00 so I didn't spend too much money on this monstrosity.Ugh!"
2,Postmodern Garbage,"I had to read this for class. The plot is all over the place and it is really boring. There is nothing memorable about this book and it is as mundane as watching a squirrel collect nuts for the winter...on second thought, watching a squirrel collect nuts for the winter is like going to Disney World when you are 4 years old compared to reading this book. I had to read this for English 196 and I can't wait to sell this back to the book store even though I got it on ebay...so in essence, selling it to the bookstore....good riddance!!!"
3,Odd.,"My account of reading 'Murphy,' expurgated, accelerated, improved and reduced, gives the following.Page one: I grin, marvelling at Beckett's wit and his prehensile command of the English language. I pause, to scan a dictionary for some obscure little term (syzygy, anyone?). I pause again, to scan another dictionary for the same obscure little term. ('You cram these words into mine ears, against the stomach of my sense' -Shak.) I sigh, thoroughly vexed by the absurdities of the 'plot' and my complete reduction to an analphabetic lexicon-dependent cur. And then at last I grin, mollified again by Beckett's wit.... Onward, page two awaits!Pages two through one-hundred and fifty-eight: same as above.Hell roast this story, I don't know what to make of it."
4,Surprising,"I read this book solely on the recommendation of a professor. I worked in a psychiatric facility for a little over a year and found myself completely stunned by how similar the conditions were despite 70 years between then and now. I don't have much literary insight since I was way too focused on the Mercyseat bits but, hey, worth a read."
3,Interesting if strange collection,"This CD, Volume 10 of the series, includes many cuts from radio broadcasts not available elsewhere. Tracks include: April Showers (Al Jolson); Body & Soul (Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra); Back In Your Own Backyard; I'll Be Seeing You; Ida; Hello 'Tucky (all Jolson); Little White Lies (Dorsey); and Where The Black Eyed Susans Grow (Jolson). ...."
3,Bought it for my PS3,"This isn't a bad little headset.. I picked it up cheap for use with my PS3. It pairs up easily and the sound quality is as good as any other headset I've used.If I had to do it over again, though, I doubt I would buy this model for gaming. There's no mute function, which isn't a must have, but it's very convenient for coughing or answering a phone call.The biggest downside is the AAAA battery. AAAA's pricey little buggers, especially if you buy them in a retail store. Amazon sells a 6 pack for $6, that's the cheapest I've seen.If you're looking for a PS3 headset, you might want to have a look at the soon to be released SOCOM headset, it looks to be ideal for gaming (as it should be)."
1,Not new.. The one I received from UnlockedCellPhoneKings,The one I received from UnlockedCellPhoneKings came is a ziplock baggie and had a 3 month warranty.This was at the very best a refurbished product.
1,"Why use AAAA, please notice AAAA not AAA","This head set paired quite easy with my Motorola V3 but the AAAA battery is very very hard to find and expensive. As I talked about 30-40 minutes with my cellular phone everyday, I do not think I could afford to buy AAAA battery so frequently. I am going to return it."
2,Very uncomfortable to wear,I would not recommend this product. The ear piece is huge n extremely uncomfortable to wear it actually falls off. Unless u have a huge ear I would not buy it.
3,Jabra bluetooth,The bluetooth works well but the earpiece is hard to stay on your ear. It is also hard to find the replacement battery. Over all it works well for the price!
2,"Cheap, staticky, like the battery though","Not overly impressed with this item.PROS:Cheap, easy to connect to phone, uses a regular 4A battery instead of a charger (which I tend to misplace, plus you don't hav to wait for it to charge if it's dead, just pop in a new battery.)CONS:Sound quality is low - there is static on the line. It's a bit heavy and awkward on the ear.VERDICT:Wish I had just spent a bit more and gotten a nicer one."
4,Works for me.,"I needed a new cell phone and live in California and its ""hands free"" here. I'm not big into needing an almighty phone and have been a Virgin pre-paid user for some time now. This headset will be left in my car to be used only when I am driving so its $10 price was perfect for me. I have had it for a month now and the battery is doing fine. I did buy some spares and keep them in the glove box. It took sometime to figure out how to turn it off but figured out that my cell tells me when I turn it off and on. Sound is good, not great. It fits my ear fine."
2,JABRA BT2040,Spend the extra cash and buy a better one. Battery does'nt last for more than a couple calls.
3,Great Piece,its great except it takes aaaa battery cant find much of those i wish it was rechargeble but other than that its great
3,Outdated and too simplistic,"I liked the format of the book, and the explanations of the answers were thorough. It is outdated, especially regarding medications. Also, I wish I had studied more neurology; it was a lot harder than the psych stuff on the board (which I took 2 days ago), and more detailed than I thought it would be. I would have used more neuro resources, and would have spent less time with this book. There was more neuroanatomy than I expected, and that is not well covered in this volume. I think this is good for practice questions and you'll learn, but you will do better if you use other sources as well. I wish I had."
2,Not so good for the psych boards...,"Not a very good review for the neuro part of the boards, question format has many simple T/F, and ""latest"" second edition is from 1998... I'd recommend the Kaufman 5th ed. which was more comprehensive and had better questions."
2,They were not what I wanted.,I thought they would look more antique looking. They looked like a fake antique. I was not happy with the color.
2,Radio controlled Hummer,"I recently purchased a hummer for my 10 year old son to play with around the house. I am very disappointed with the product due to the fact it has very little power and will not pull itself up a hill greater than approx. two degree's.I exchanged it for a different type and have had about the same luck with it also. If you plan to have this product for climbing hills as it shows it will do, you will need to look else where. At this point I plan to look into another product and see if there is a make of a stronger product with more power and that has a higher voltage system with greater power."
4,Indestructable,"I bought two of these Hummers about 2 1/2 years ago and they both still run like champs. I have two little kids, and myself, that have used these trucks to the hilt during the summer time. They have been driven across gravel, rolled down several flights of concrete steps, driven off the top of walls and fallen at least 10 feet to the ground. Neither one has ever stopped running. These things are tanks! I am very impressed with the Nikko build quality of their vehicles. Does not work well in the grass due to the 2 wheel drive only and also the low ground clearance for the motor housing. Other than that, I would def recommend it!"
3,Great item - bad quality,"We bought one of these at Home Depot, and it worked great for awhile. But it broke within the 90 day return period, so we returned it.Great concept, but poorly made."
1,Good waste of money,"It worked for about a week, then died. The wiring is very thin, and there is no on/off switch that is easly accessable without taking it apart. The store, Bed Bath and Beyond, said it was out of stock and no more expected. It now sits in a landfill in the Imperial valley for perhaps a future generation to discover. The batteries went to recycle."
4,Creepshow indeed,"This is an interesting dvd of neo prog pioneers. I have read that this band has been called Punk Floyd by some. This is not really an accurate name. This band is unique- not really sounding like anyone in particular. They created a unique sound that blended prog, rock, punk and some new wave tendancies. Pallas and Marillion took a ""Genesis"" approach in a lot of their work. This band has a little bit of that but forged a different sound not really reminding me entirely of Genesis. Thus, I think they were the most creative of the lot. Weird but nevertheless very interesting music that holds your attention. Great bass player too! As a matter of fact all 5 are great musicians. Creepshow is a good longer composition while the Ceiling Speaks is a good opener. Worth a look...too bad this band is not around anymore."
2,Blundered on Rangers History,"Missed the worst blunder in Texas Rangers History, beingApril 1, 1982: Lee Mazzilli Traded by the New York Mets to the Texas Rangers for Ron Darling and Walt Terrell.August 8, 1982: Lee Mazzilli Traded by the Texas Rangers to the New York Yankees for Bucky Dent."
4,me and will,"SEEING THE COVER ON THIS VIDEO MADE ME THINK THAT THIS WAS JUST SOME POORLY DIRECTED BIKER FLICK. BUT, I THOUGHT WHAT THE HELL, GIVE IT A TRY. AFTER ALL, IF IT WAS TOO BORING I COULD JUST REWIND AND WATCH SOMETHING ELSE. MUCH TO MY SURPRISE, IT STARTED OUT FAIRLY INTERESTING. EVEN THOUGH I WAS TIRED, I KNEW THAT I WOULD END UP WATCHING THE ENTIRE MOVIE. YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE THESE TWO LADIES TO BEGIN WITH, HOWEVER, AS THE MOVIE PROGRESSES, YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF INFATUATED WITH THEIR DESIRE TO REACH THEIR FINAL GOAL. TRAVELING THROUGH THE COUNTRYSIDE YOU WILL WISH YOU WERE RIDING RIGHT BEHIND THEM. BEAUTIFUL SCENERY ON LONG STRETCHES OF ROAD. THERE IS MINOR NUDITY AND A FEW SEXUAL SCENES, BUT, THEY ARE PRESENTED IN A WAY, THAT YOU WILL NOT BE OFFENDED. EVEN THOUGH I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED ...THE END CAME OF NO SURPRISE TO ME. IF YOU ARE INTO RIDING THE OPEN ROAD, ESPECIALLY YOU LADIES, THIS IS A MUST SEE."
2,This is no Easy Rider,"I had high hopes for this movie but they blew it. It's just a story of two losers with bikes. Yes, Easy Rider could be characterized that way but at least it was thought provoking and the characters had some depth. This is ""just watch two bimbos ride around and get in trouble."" I also felt the film went a little too far in the explicit scenes of drug use and they made it look a little too cool through most of the movie. I'm afraid girls with some money will try to imitate. Understandably, the movie did not receive wide distribution so little damage was probably done."
4,Me and Wil,"My wife and I, both avid riders, enjoyed this movie very much. We have seen it twice. I normally do not purchase movies, and of the very few I would consider, this will be one, (as soon as the price drops)! You get something different out of it each time. The women who starred in it do a wonderful, convincing job of the characters they portray. At times, it seems almost like a documentary in its reality. No Hollywood BS or hype in this film! What an independent should be! Anyway, my wife and I hope we will be seeing more from Melissa and Sherrie in the very near future. These two women are what independent film makers are all about."
3,No bad...,Me and Will is a loooooooooooooow budget movie. It's a girlie road movie which have it's highs and lows as they try to find the ultimate machine.....The reason why I bought it is because DOGSTAR play a song at the beginning.....Keanu Reeves plays bass in Dogstar. They were good for the 30 seconds they were on film.I watched the rest of the movie ~ a bit too depressing for me...
5,What a great diverse collection of art!,"The various artists on this compilation are talented. The CD provides an interesting mix of art, talent and style. Check it out. Chicago's very own!"
5,Astrobrights are always dependably the finest.,Astrobrights are always dependably the finest. Have used in my office and personal office for 30 years and this paper performs. Usually have used 20# but have had a need recently for 24# and thought what the heck and checked if it was even made. Wow was I happy to see my most favorite paper in the weight needed. Will continue to buy.
3,Not totally what I expected...,"I bought it because I have trouble with blackheads and really wanted to remove them... I put this on and it does warm up your face like others have said, it burns! It makes my eyes water, but the burning only lasts a few seconds, then it dries and starts to tighten. You take it off after a few minutes using cold water. It makes my skin feel very smooth and it even looks nicer, except... it doesn't remove blackheads. I'll still be looking for my perfect blackhead removing product... this isn't it. I will still continue to buy this though, because it does make my skin look nice... apart from the blackheads."
1,Very Disapointed.,"Only buy this item if you don't mind having to glue it back together. Also the blood on it is sticky and sticks to your hands. I am very disapointed with this purchase. I needed this for a Halloween costume and I wish that I could return it but then I wouldn't have one for Halloween, so I had to freaking repair it! It doesn't look like the picture either.. the leg that came to me is pink in color rather than flesh colored."
1,THIS IS NOT GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I CAN UNDERSTAND WRITING A SONGS THAT YOU WANT PEOPLE TO LIKE. BUT THIS IS COMPLETE GARBAGE...VOCALS ARE TERRIBLE, BASS SOUNDS LIKE A BEGINNER AND THE DRUMMER SHOULD BE PLAYING IN A DISCO BAND!!!!!! WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING TO CHICAGO MUSIC. GOOD LUCK CUZ YOU WILL NEED A HELL OF A LOT OF IT................SH*T!!!!!!!!!"
1,THIS IS PRETTY BAD MUSIC,"SOUNDS LIKE A BASEMENT TAPE.AND THE MIX IS NOT THAT GOOD COULD DO BETTER WITH VOCALS ALSO .THIS IS NOT GONNA BE A BIG SELLER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!CAN I GIVE IT A BIG "" 0 """
5,I loved this,I had the first few issues of this title and loved every bit. It gives good insight into the heros beginings and he jumps right into action with his new abilities. I never got a chance to finish the series but will soon.
5,"Les is ""the man""","Joe Walsh tells us that Les Paul is every electric guitarist grandfather, and he is right. This is a great video if you want to know how it all started...necessity is the mother of invention. Thank you, Les Paul and I love my Joe Perry Signiture Series guitar."
2,not very practical,"This book covers a very wide range of active and passive filter types, but it has some serious shortcomings which often result from the overall strategy of the book, which is the use of BASIC programs to compute filters...1. The example programs are written in an old version of unstructured (line-numbered) BASIC.2. The programs are dispersed amongst the book, which breaks up the flow of the text.3. There are essentially NO equations for the various filter types. If you want an equation, you have to painstakingly reverse-engineer it from the old basic code.Check out Don Lancaster's Active Filter Cookbook. It has much greater technical depth and background, plus the cookbook nature (normalized solutions) makes it easy to design filters if you aren't interested in the technical background."
5,Perfect case for Luna Dreadnought Guitars,Case is very lightweight and good build. Materials are nice and provides great protection for the guitar.
2,not that great,We received this carseat as a gift. We liked how easy it latches into the base and how soft it is. However getting it out of the car is tough it is always getting stuck. The car seat is large so not good for a small car. We also have a hard time strapping her into it. If we would have seen it in a store before we got it we would have asked for a different one. My daughter is 3 1/2 months and we are looking at getting a different one. Bad investment on this one.
1,"Faulty control panel, lousy customer service","Heartrate monitor doesn't work. Speed, distance, and other readouts work only occasionally. Called customer service and the representative said she'd get back to me after consulting the Bowflex tech. dept. She didn't return my call. Over the next 18 days I tried other customer service representatives, only to be told they couldn't take over an open case. Finally asked for the cust. service manager. and got a new circuit board sent, but didn't correct the problem. Very difficult to box up a 300 lb. machine and send it back. Very frustrating to be asked by Bowflex to fix a new $1400 treadmill myself. Service reps. ranged from indifferent to rude."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I wish I could rate this product with negative stars. I bought the series 7 treadmill back in 2006 for $1500, and ever since it has consistently proved to not be worth the money. Upon delivery, we noticed that the fan in the console was broken. About a year-and-a-half later, the machine froze during a routine workout and gave a ""safe out"" error code. After several painful tests, customer service diagnosed it as a failed motherboard. Then they charged $250 to replace this part, but it took them several MONTHS to ship the replacement. Less than a year after that, the same thing happened and they again gave us the same diagnosis. I find it ridiculous that I have spent nearly $1800 on this machine and gotten less than 3 solid years out of it. Worse yet, their customer service is horrible!"
1,Bowflex Series 7 Treadmill,"This machine has been sitting in my living room for about a monthand has never worked. All of my calls to the bowflex ""servicedepartment"" are wasted with promises that a technician will calland fix the problem. No one has ever called. I have a 300 poundhunk of iron junk in my home gathering dust, and no recourse ormeans of getting rid of it. $1600 down the toilet."
5,Great product,We have had this for almost 6 years. Still going strong and never had a problem with it. I would definitely buy from Bowflex again.
4,Minus the fan but works great,"I initially purchased this from bowflex and they were goin to charge me an additional 175$ for tax and over 200$ for shipping and it would take 45 days to be delivered. Amazon had it to me in a week and no tax and shipping was free!! The tradmill came in a huge box and it's really heavy! It's not easy to move and the fan was broke when I got it, but I love the treadmill and I figure a broken fan is better than paying the extra 500$. I am already down 12 lbs an I feel great!!"
1,BFlex Ser 7 Treadmill,"After 14 months of moderate use (I prefer running outdoors when weather is good), the treadmill quit in the middle of awork out. Attempts to contact the company have benn met with silence. No response to e-mail and an impossible phone tree. Have to say I will NEVER buy from this company again if they produce a product that fails in such a short time and does not respond to a customers simple request for repair information."
2,Buyer Beware,I read many of the great reviews about this product before purchasing it. It worked well for the 1st month and then electronics failed. Now these things do happen even to good products. The replacement of the parts is covered under the warrenty.The problem is very bad customer service from the Manufacture - Nautilus. After repeated calls and 3 botched handings of our service request we still haven't got the thing fixed.If this thing didn't weigh hundreds of pounds I would have returned it. Next time I purchase equipment like this will be via a local dealer who can service the equipment themselves.
2,Bowflex Series 7 Failure,"Had the Series 7 for 18 months and mother board failed. For what I spent on this item could have stuck with my gym membership for 3 years. The repairman who showed up looked at the Precor stepper I own next to the treadmill and said I should have stuck with the Precor. Same old story, you get what you pay for."
1,Not Workimg Properly Upon Arrival,Not working properly upon arrival. I've been on hold for 30 minutes with their warranty service. I've gone from 16th in the queue to 11th in that time. I will update this review if the situation improves.
4,bowflex series 7,the machine seems to be working great so far. When we recieved it however the fan was completely broke off. We had to take the back off and remove it and are still waiting for a replacement that they say they will replace.
1,Beware. Broken after only 16 months of light use.,I only put about 20 miles a month on this machine. The logic board broke and needs replacing at $300.00. No thanks. It's going out to the curb. Junk!
3,Made in China,"I bought this treadmill because of it's high rating in Consumer Reports. I'll admit that, so far, I'm happy with it. However, I was dissapointed to learn that it was made in China. My experience with Chinese products has not been a positive one. Poison in dog food, toothpaste, pharmaceuticals, and sheetrock are just a few examples of why I am so lerry of Chinese products. Low quality and cheap components seem to be synonymous with ""Made in China"".I know it's unthinkable for America to build our own treadmills, but I would feel a lot more confident about my investment if it had been made in Japan or Germany. Time will tell."
1,Still Not Working,"The treadmill I have had in my house for a month is still not working (it was delivered non functioning). It has not worked from day one, and after one confused customer service rep after another it doesn't look like it will even be looked at for another two weeks."
2,Boo Consumer Reports!!!,Consumer Reports rated this treadmill very highly. I am not impressed! The speed sensor did not work on the machine and so I was sent another sensor from Nautilus with instructions written in Chinese. I do not feel I should have to repair a brand new piece of equipment. I finally had the speed sensor repaired and the fan doesn't work! I will never buy another piece of equipment from Nautilus. Amazon.com has been most generous by taking off an additional 10% of the purchase price so I could hire someone to come over and replace the sensor. Consumer Reports - you dropped the ball on this one!
1,Terrible,Treadmill broke down within two weeks. Problem with the belt. Terrible customer service. It will take at least two weeks to get it fixed. They seem to do everything they can to get out of fixing it.
4,good treadmill,"The product was not too difficult to set-up but did require 2 people to help install the console. It is also very heavy so it won't be moved from it's current location. Both my husband and I use it 3-6x/week and it works great -- very quiet, easy to use. Drawbacks include not being able to adjust the fan on the console to different angles/heights and the console doesn't constantly display time or calories or distance but cycles through the various displays which can be annoying."
4,fit2btied,This product was delivered in excellent shape and sooner than I had expected. The assembly was quite easy. The only suggestion I might have is there needs to be more information on the adjustments. There is not really enough information to allow me to adjust the belt without talking to someone.
1,Wasted time,What a waste of time. Ordered this product and it came in with the control panel crushed. Amazon discounted the unit because Bow Flex would not take it back. Bowflex sent me the parts at no charge but I had to install the new display and control panel boards myself. Bowflex had no one to come out for the repair. Next the fit and finish is terrible on this treadmill compared to others I looked at. I bought this online and never saw one up close. Everything is warped and scratched. Now the unit shuts off after 5 min and after several calls to bowflex they tell me we have to buy a new tread and belt because we didn't lube it enough. Then after I spend the 250 on that if that doesn't fix it they will cover the motor under warranty. I'm sending this junk back to china where it crawed out of a hole. Will never buy crap from Bowflex again.
4,Treadmill,"Product has performed as expected.We had to call Nautilus and get a replacement part for a crossbar that was manufacured incorrectly. It came in several days and was installed without problems.Delivery of the treadmill was uneventful. They even brought the large box into the house where we built it and are now using it. As it was a heavy box, this was greatly appreciated.Thanks."
2,Product may be good -- company support lousy,I bought this treadmill based on Consumer Reports recommendation. Mine was malfunctioning right out of the box. Nautilus/Bowflex made me do a series of disassembly projects to self-diagnose the problem. This included opening the motor housing -- despite the big sticker warning against that. They eventually said they could mail me the parts and arrange for a tech to see if he could repair it.Their customer service support was lousy. I returned it through Amazon and will never buy any Nautilus/Bowflex product that might require product support.
5,Very durable,"I am 6'2"", 230 lbs. This machine holds up to the pounding of jogging on it and is long enough for my stride while running. Easy to put together. The one touch speed control is not true. While running and wishing to select a different speed, you need to select the speed and hit enter otherwise it will revert back to the speed it was originally at."
2,Some of the keys on control console not work,"From day one, three keys on my control console do not work. I will never recommend this product to anyone who has not owned this product yet."
1,Bowflex Series 7,"The fan was broken upon arrival. After calibrating multiple times, the MPH were still wrong. Drink holders were tilted so much that unless you had a closed top bottle it would spill. The display unit is so thick that even specially ordering a magazine holder would not work for holding reading materials."
4,Bowflex series 7 treadmill,"Pro. The unit is physically solid, stableFree shipping is pretty quick, but the front axis cover is broken (the charge of fixing costs Bowflex is too much at least $150Con. User manual is not good. I believe that my technical reading skill is very high but still do not know how to lube the belt (do I need to call for a technician by then!)The heart rate monitor does not work. I have been getting in touch with Bowflex technical support, and they plan to fix the handgrips. I hope that this defect can be solved (Otherwise. I would very disappointed because I buy this new one for that main purpose)The belt noise is unusual if we do not walk on it.Suggestion. To save for the company, they should provide the consumers a very good and complete manual and instructions because there are many users can solve some simple problems fast by themself."
5,Bowflex Series 7 Treadmill,"My husband and I are very happy with our recent purchase of this treadmill. It is fairly quiet, easy to use, and has a long enough belt that you can walk or run without worry. I especially like that the fan has different speeds. We would absolutely recommend this treadmill to anyone looking for a great treadmill for a decent price."
5,Great machine,"I read consumer reports looking for the best treadmill for someone other than a serious distance runner. This was the recommended machine. Its a bit pricey and you do have to do assemble it when it arrives, but its a great machine. It even has a built in fan. One caution, make sure to assemble it in the room where you want it to be and don't expect to be able to move it between rooms because when assembled its too wide for standard doorways."
1,Bad Experience,"When my machine arrived it was not working properly. The motor is making a very loud noise. I understand that sometimes there are problems with equipment; however, I am extremley dissappointed in Bowflex customer service. Everytime I have called there has been an minimum of a 30 minute wait to speak with someone. Once I got someone live, they agreed that the machine needed repair. They said I would be receiving a call from a repair person to fix the machine. That was over 5 days ago and I still have not been contacted. For the price of this equipment, my expectations are to receive proper working equipment and great customer service. This has been extremely inconvenient.The machine was easy to put together and looks like it would be great if it worked, but if you receive a defective machine good luck with customer service."
1,Poor service Bowflex Series 7 Treadmill,"I purchased the Bowflex Series 7 Treadmill 11/06 and it was great. However, in Mar. 2007 the rear roller became noisy. I contacted the company and they immediately shipped a ""front"" roller by mistake. The technician could not find anything wrong so he did nothing.The rear roller noise became extremely loud and we've contacted the company. They initially said they would ship a rear roller but now they cannot give any date at all.We're not pleased with the service. We need the treadmill for walking. My husband Jim had a stroke 2 years ago and he was walking 4 miles per day outside then on the treadmill but he cannot use it now."
4,Just started using it!,So far so good! Just one month into ownership. Read all reviews before purchasing along with Consumer Reports reviews and happy with purchase. The small details/negatives of fan that doesn't produce (haven't used it yet) or being able to read prompts of programming haven't hindered me. Just take your time and enjoy! Try using a dinasaur of a treadmill at a gym to realize how amazing this treadmill is. This is a solid machine. Just don't go up too many floors with it as it is a heavy piece. Delivery was smooth and people courtious. I'll keep you posting on long term use!
3,Something's Missing,"I just finished reading LP&L today. It was a very entertaining book and I can understand the comparison to John Irving, but the book seemed to be missing something. When I finish an Irving novel I really feel like I know the characters and miss being caught up in their stories. I don't feel that any of the characters in LP&L will stick around in my memory. Part of the problem was too many characters popping in and out of the story. The other part of the problem is the inability of any of the characters gain any wisdom through their travails, especially Billy Wayne. It's still an enjoyable book and worth reading."
3,Started out strong- I thought we had another Ken Wells,By the end of the book I just didn't care and even skimmed the Epilogue just to be 'done' with it.
1,Totally Worthless,The paper used to print this worthless screed was wasted. This is a typical geographical put down based on regional stereotyping. Drufresne assumes everyone in a given location is totally ignorant and comical. What an insult! How did this manuscript ever get accepted for publication?
1,I thought that the book was horrible.,This book is not worth anyones time whatso ever. I mean who ever heard of a book about a family of swamp people. John Dufresne has totally wasted my time and I am heading to the store as soon as I'm done writing this to return it. I DON't recomend it.
5,The Best Recording of the Prokofiev 2,"This is the best recording that I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Dagmar Baloghova, a pianist I can find no information about, plays it in the clean, fiery way that all Prokofiev should be played. Words don't do it justice. Also on this disc is Sviatoslav Richter playing the Tchaikovsky 1, which I don't even need to promote. Both of the recordings are shockingly clean despite their age (1953 & 1963). A must-have for any Tchaikovsky or Prokofiev fanatic."
2,All plastic construction,"This toy is for display purposes only. The joints will break, they are made of plastic. The plastic looks a little yellowish. When I have time I will repaint mine to make it look better. If I saw this in person I probably would not have bought it. I am debating whether to use a Gundam marker to make it look better.***The cover over the cockpit is just a removable piece, it does not retract."
4,Album title?,"If you're a Spirit or Randy California fan then you'll like this.Piss-poor title for someone who drowned though, doncha think?One more thought, CD-Rs suck, don't buy from Amazon-get a used one instead!"
4,Great Head,This is a great head. the only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 because it is a little bit hard to catch with. Overall this is a great midi or attack stick because its so narrow. This stick is really worth it and total under rated. So do us a favor and GET IT!!
1,Neil Young: under review 1966-1975,I returned this product when I read in the newspaper that this CD is actually NOT a Neil Young peroduct at all!! Do not buy it if you expect to see and hear a lot of Neil Young ... Neil Young did NOT authorize this product.
1,Avoid,"This is a bad joke. Who wants to see 10 second clips? I'm sending my copy back to Amazon and requesting a refund. FWIW, I've been a Neil fan since 1967. I had a bad feeling when I read the ""this is unauthorized"" disclaimer on the back of the DVD. It is unauthorized and a total waste of time unless you've lived in a cave for forty years, and if that is the case, you wouldn't care anyway."
1,Talk Talk Talk,This video is boring. Not sanctioned by Neil Young. Just talk and no Neil Young music. I'm sorry I bought the DVD.
2,sedan delivery failed,"being a die-hard neil young fan for years, i neither learned anything new i didn't previously READ, or see anything i haven't previously seen. still giving it two stars because neil young is the topic. i would give the same credit to an hour of neil eating popcorn."
1,WEAK,"Avoid this. Nothing new here. You are better off with all previous NY DVDs (which are great, BTW).This is a bunch of talking head critics rambling on with nothing new to add."
2,A Few Interesting Clips,"This DVD has a few interesting (but too short) fairly rare clips. Another reviewer wrote that they can be found on YouTube in longer versions. Mostly for completists, but completists probably already have the clips, and won't learn much from the commentary. (In fact, hardcore fans may notice at least one historical inaccuracy.) I guess that doesn't leave much of an audience for this DVD. Do yourself a favor and fast forward over obnoxious blow-hard Robert Christgau's comments; you are far more likely to be annoyed by him than to learn anything from him."
3,"Looks like a nice game, no English instructions though","I bought this to give as a gift for Christmas.I just heard from the person I gave it to, they complained that it comes with instructions in a bunch of languages but none of them was English!Otherwise I'd have probably given this item 5 stars..."
2,no English instructions,"First of all the unit does not come with instructions in English. Its hard to read because of small fonts but the unit will lite up the display, which helps a lot. The contrast is a problem also. You should have the ability to control contrast. You might but without instructions, forget it. It has merit but for the money paid, try else where"
3,Unrealistic...,"This book is not one of the best out about eating disorders. The main character of this book, Marty, is very unrealistic. When she enters a rehabilitation centor for her disorder, she makes alot of snide comments about everyone, and seems to know evertyhign about every eating disorder out there. I personally found this to be very unrealistic and it was insulting to the readers' intelligence to think that they would believe in such a character. (And I know people who've had eating disorders-- they dont' tend to be like that.)Also, there are many gaping holes in the plot, or unneeded little tidbits that distract from the point of the book.The writing of this book is unique in its metaphors, but it's too-in-your-face, and leaves the reader thinking ""this was a good start. if edited better, it would have been even better.""However, something about this book makes you keep reading."
4,GO NAMO INTERACTION!,"Namo Web Editor is by Jasc Inc. but orginally from South Korea's Namo Interaction, i was using the program for a long time in Korea too and I just LOVE the program. it's kinda expensive but it's worth it! and very simple and easy to use!"
1,Not Really for Novices,"The promotional material states that Namo is a good product for both novices and professional web page designers. Well, I am a novice and it is greatly lacking in help for the unschooled user. There is no program-based tutorial. The web page help appears to be populated by experienced designers. What's more, there is no traditional book available for those who order the download version. I am an experienced computer user and have actually designed web pages already, but wanted something to make it real easy. this may be that, but I think you need to be at a higher level before you can use Namo. You need to have a good working knowledge of web page design terminology to use it.Most software that you buy lets you starts from scratch. Not Namo."
3,Why A.A / N.A. was invented...,"Honestly I have to say that ultimately I was entertained. There were a couple of parts where they just lingered too long on one individual. Also, the editing was bad and in certain instances the lighting as well. However for an amateur production, it was good. This DVD is one of those ""off the wall"" purchases for sh*ts and giggles. It's comparable to Girls Gone Wild as it shows as much of the male anatomy as Girls Gone Wild did of the female anatomy. Watched it with 2 girls and a guy and we all agree that drunk guys are a lot funnier to look at."
1,Not As Wild As One May Want,"Okay, we've heard about Girls Gone Wild and even seen the crazy commercials. Well, Guys Gone Wild isn't all that wild. Shallow as it may seem, I was disappointed because there was nothing worth writing home about. Tons of chests and single butt cheeks. For ""wild"" guys, many were very tame. You would get the occassional frontal shots here and there and a shower, but ""Guys Gone Wild"" is not as ""Wild"" as one may have hoped. However, if you want a few good ""I can't believe this guy is that drunk or crazy"" laughs with friends, then the novelty is here."
2,Platinum Edition?,"I've seen a few others and must say that for being the ""Platinum Edition"" it wasn't all that great. There are a few funny scenes (jumping into the pool from the balcony) and some good looking guys, but I would say rent this one and save your money for something else. True, I have watched it a few times so I did get my money's worth, but renting a few for the same price as owning this one would have been a better investment."
3,It was...ok,"To be honest...it was not what I thought it was gonna be. Yeah it was funny, and the guys were beautiful, but the editing was not that great, and like everyone else said, you can barely hear the guys. Will I order another version, sure."
2,Bad,"Terrible video, I think the review is saying things that are not fulfilled when you see it. Bad decision to buy."
3,Guys Gone Nude and Stupid,"This movie is nothing more than a crew of babes going around key college vacation areas convincing drunk and otherwise innebriated college guys take off their clothes and do stupid things, including the bologna toss. Don't get me wrong, some of these guys are hot, but aside from the showers scenes this movie doesn't really do much, except maybe convince you to grab something a little raunchier out of the collection. 3 stars, at least the camera crew has some taste (sometimes.)"
1,Very Disappointed,"I was really disappointed after watching this. It gets REALLY boring really fast. It's a bunch of average sized penises with average, almost ugly guys. It's more awkward then hot. You can tell the only reason they are showing their ""stuff"" is to get with the girl filming but you can tell she justs want to make money buy filming a lot of penises. If you are debating on buying this... do NOT!!! It's a waste of time and a waste of money. Why spend all the money just to see AVERAGE if not UGLY guys and UGLY penises?! The ""BONUS"" footage is even stupid!"
2,ok,"""bad boys"" was the best film of this series of these girls film shooting straight guys shooting their load. this particular film was not as good. the film crew may want to consider not crowding in on the guy's tool while they are shooting their money shot. also, guys, and girls i think, like to see the faces of guys and their bodies as they shoot their stuff. use new people as well in the shoot off scenes. thanks."
3,No AzN Representation,"first of all, my name is Dao Hoang and iam a GGW`a`holic but there were no asian men which really dissapointed me alos there were no gay scene only straight man flash. still sexy movie, but not wnwogh AzN props :( still worth it hto :) u shuld try to get amn buy ti for u its easier instead my man bought me mine :) save your money :) :)"
1,An unpleasant surprise,"When I saw ""Gone Wild"" I thought it was ""Girls Gone Wild."" The video was very boring and nothing much happened. I kept watching waiting for some girls to show up and about 20 minutes in I realized they weren't coming. The shower scenes were painful to watch. I doubt someone who wasn't gay would enjoy this movie much. Lots of muscular guys but not many shots of their genitals (thank God!) I found this video to be quite terrible indeed."
1,waste of time,"I was looking forward to this as a bit of fun voyeurism and titillation. It was none of that. It was stupid. Period. The women who ""directed"" this mess were loud and obnoxious and seemed mostly interested in making these guys look like fools. If you're looking for something slightly sexy, go elsewhere. This video is bad. BAD, BAD, BAD."
5,"Finally, the unedited version that is worth the money","Sweet, I've been waiting awhile for Amazon to carry this version instead of the edited mainstream version of the first Guys Gone Wild, as I love the other special uncensored Guys Gone Wild releases but I found the 2 normal versions (original Guys Gone Wild and GGW: Spring Break Explosion) that you can buy in lots of stores to be disappointing. I am a really big fan of these videos because they are very slickly produced and come on, it's just irresistable seeing straight college guys showing off all their, um, assets. May as well get as much action and flesh as you can if you're gonna buy a title like this, I say. I saw this at a friend's house, and I can't imagine anyone choosing the edited original GGW with this now available as you do get more explicit footage with this uncut version."
2,We Need More...but better!,"This video is a ""must have"" for any collection...but the vapid camera girls need to go away. The girls ruined an otherwise great video. I suggest that the producers still use girls to bait the obviously heterosexual hunks, but they need to hire some that can actually operate a camera. Aditionally! If the bait has to open her mouth, then please, please edit the sound! I suggest watching this video with the sound ""off"". Expect lots of poorly focused video, and worse editing. This looks more like something produced by high school kids that had no affiliation to any AV club."
4,Handmade American Music At Its Best!,"4 1/2! The Dexateens have put out a lot of really strong albums, but this seems to be the one I go back to most often. I don't think the Stones comparison is really appropriate. The Stones may have dabbled in Southern-rock, countryish territory. This is much more firmly grounded in that tradition. Drive-By Truckers is probably a better comparison. The songwriting is surprisingly strong, and each song is delivered with energy and sincerity. This is a really good album from start to finish."
5,Historical look at custom cars.,"This book is superb.In the tradition of ""MBI"" this book has maintained the standards.Beautiful photography that will impress.If you're looking for ideas for your next project or just love the art of customized cars then this book is for you."
1,What is it?,This fitting is not the standard 6-inch PVC fitting it purports to be. It is undersize by 1/4 inch and is useless. I want my money back.
3,its not worth $89,ITS NOT WORTH $89!!!!!!!!! YOUR CRAZY WHO EVER IS SELLING THIS! SHINEING STARS HAVE BEEN DIS-CONTINUED AND CANT GO ONLINE WITH THEM ANYMORE BUT THAT STILL DOES NOT MAKE THEM WORTH $89!
2,DW Cymbal Stacker-- not quite what I hoped for,"I had high hopes for the DW Cymbal Stacker. Why? I love DW products, I am a professional drummer and am always looking for innovative products that help me set up and breakdown faster and that make my drumkit more ""efficient"". I thought these would be great. Well-- the quality is great, but the product is awkward. I found that after installing the cymbal stacker-- there was not enough space between the two cymbals for effective stick work-- in other words its hard to strike the lower cymbal without hitting the top cymbal as well. Plus it would be nice if it had an adjustment allowing one to angle the attached cymbal."
2,Review on the cartridge.,"The cartridge in this player has to be one of the dumbest designs I have ever seen. The CD's go in up side down. If you want to check each slot , it's upside down so you cant read the CD which makes absolutely NO SENSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ."
1,Piece of junk!!!!!!!,"4 months into it and it stops playing, jams up and i can't remove the cassette or any or the Cd's.....won't ever but Pioneer again."
2,Returned cd player waiting for replacement or refund,"I returned the new cd player immediatly after i connected it to the amplifier.That was on the day I received the player from Googol Shop in July. It had a clicking noise.The seller, Googol Shop acknowledged receiving the player and stated they would have Pioneer Center check the player . That was in July. Here we are near the end of September and they have still not sent me a new player or refunded my purchase amount.I e-mailed Googol Shop on the 20th but have not received a reply.I bought Pioneer as I have all there audio products and never had a problem. This new cd player was replacing one that I gave to my nephew for his college dorm in July."
5,PIONEER PD-M426 6-DISC CD PLAYER,"Very nice piece.Bought as replacement for Older 6 Disc CD player that became jammed by the 6 Disc cartridge! This model offers the same cartridge but does not require the cartridge to be inserted thru a door opening and brought deep into the player for use. This model simply accepts the cartridge when pushed thru the flip-up door and locks into place, while still flush with the front of the player. Believe this simple design will prevent some of the issues encountered with the more elaborate cartridge type players. Use is easy and with 6 discs from which to choose or play at random, the unit provides many hours of music on single load. Once you've used a multi-disc player, it's hard to switch back to the single disc models. Would recommend to those still using ""old"" CD's like me, vice the new MP-3 Ipod crowd. Yes, I still have my old LP turntable.:)"
2,Obsolete technology,"This player is a newer version of a Pioneer CD changer I have had since 1991. That original model was fantastic and lasted pretty much until 2008-- except for the fact that it did not play burned audio (not mp3, but audio) CDs.I bought the new model thinking that that would certainly have been updated, but to my disappointment it was not. When I called Pioneer, they said that this new model was designed in 1997, which explains why it does not play burned CDs. According to that representative, there are no Pioneer models newer than this.If this is anything like its predecessor, it's probably a very good player, except for this major drawback, which is why I feel that it really can't get more than two stars."
1,Faulty CD changer,"The CD changer behaved erratically. Sometimes it would scroll through the stack, playing none. Sometimes pressing the track change button would send it to the next disc. Possibly a simple fix, but I had no option but to return it. Too bad, otherwise I think a fine product."
4,CD changer that works,"I purchased this CD after reviewing many other CD changers. This model is also a newer version of a player my dad had when I was growing up. It worked great then, and it works great now. It doesn't have any bells and whistles, but I love to throw in a good mix of music, hit RANDOM and relax... Perfect for the casual listener."
5,Pioneer PD-M426 6-Disc Magazine CD Player,Excellent product. Easy to set up. Simple operation. Good quallity sound. Excellent service from Amazon.
5,Very pleased with this CD player.,"We are very happy we selected this CD player. We chose it because of its features, the Pioneer name, and the price. We received it just in time to listen to Christmas music in our home, and we will be enjoying it throughout the year. We recommend this purchase."
1,keeping my pd-m60,"I was trying to replace my 24 year old pd-m60. In this case, they don't make them like they use to. The first thing I noticed was that I could hear the cd spinning while standing in front of the player. Next, the front panel was not user friendly. You have to hold down search arrow instead of a numerical key pad. Then I realized it wouldn't take the single play magazine from my pd-m60. I don't know why pioneer bothered, the laser pick-up and sound miight be slightly better, but other wise a total bust. Pioneer really let me down."
4,Pioneer does the job,"Have only had the Pioneer CD changer for a couple of months, but so far it is serving our purpose of playing multiple disks songs in random order. It did not come with an amplifier, nor a reminder that I needed one, so I had to jury rig with an old combination record/casette/radio player that serves as my amplifier. Plus it did not come with any connection wires, so had to jury rig with what I had."
4,best changer in the world !!!!!!!!!!!!!,I've had a number of changers from the carousel 5 disc changers to the 500 plus that go round and takes you a week to load . the PIO PD-M426 is a great answer to the ?s of why my old changer keeps playing the same song or the same disc and not the others . well its got a a little thing thats called a Random memory that remembers what it plays and what it didn't . the only thing I wish it did have was a headphone jack but other than that it's a great unit .
5,Pioneer CD Player M426,"The M426 was a replacement for our PDM603 and is very similar, except that the M426 has no volume control on its remote, which the old one had.Having the volume control on the remote is very handy and I will miss this feature. Otherwise it's just as good and a fair price."
5,For CD lovers,Love it!!!!!Plays cartridges(6 CD's at a time) of our favorite CD's. We bought 6 extra cartriges so we can play all our favorites.
2,Was Broken when received,Love this product. I own this CD player but need to replace it after 15 years of constant use. I teach music and I use it in the classroom. Easy to use. However I think it was packed improperly and broke along the way. Something was loose when I took it out of the box. Had to send it back. But I will find another.
4,6 disc CD player,"The seller's service was very good, prompt delivery, as promised.As for the product:It seems that I buy one of these about every 5 years. The laser pickup is the weak part, and since I already have all my CDs in the 6 pack cartridges, I'm kinda committed. Earlier versions of this player were more feature-rich. The newer ones are pretty basic units. The sound quality is still very good. It's a bit disappointing to see that pioneer seems to be slowly abandoning this design."
3,Sad!,"Got this to replace a 550 at church. The remote is terrible. It does not allow the easy selection of tracks. It seems to be designed primarily for disc selection. We need to select different hymns from different discs. Will have to look for a universal remote that will work with it. Cartridge system is great, much better than a carousel. Pioneer makes good products have used their equipment for years."
3,Good for the money but flimsy,"It is a nice unit with very good sound but the disc holder is so flimsy and looks as if it were to fall on the floor it would break into many pieces. Putting in the cd's upside down is very awkward especially unloading them. The timer is only for the length of the song. You cannot see how long the cd plays.No track numbers on the remote . The remote has very difficult black on black readings. What's with these company designers? You must hit the forward button to get to the track. It is replacing my 22 year old JVC dream player which finally retired to cd heaven. This player will never last that long. Of this I am sure. But, ok for the price."
4,additional items to be ordered with this,"I am so happy with my new item, but dummy that I was I didn't know that I needed a receiver beforeit would work. I had to buy a receiver and speakers at Best Buy so I didn't have to wait foranother order from you. Then they forgot to sell me the speaker wires and I had to make anothertrip out there. I know it was suggested that I buy speakers,but nothing about the receiver whenI ordered the cd player from you.This is just my opinion, but I am 78 years old and didn't really know what I got into.It is a great unit, however, and I really enjoy it now."
4,Pioneer Changer M-426,I replaced a 1980's Pioneer Changer similar to the M426 that was no working. The new changer works great and uses the old CD changer holders. I love it.
3,The author says it all,"Although this is a great soucebook, information wise, C.J. strikes again with the ridiculously overpowered O.C.C.'s and Creatures. For instance the Cosmo Knight. 2d4x10+60M.D.C. on body and another 500 in the armor! That's more than most power armor. There are literally dozens of other shining examples like that in this book. However, the source material is very interesting. Thank god C.J. has left Palladium, we don't need another South America 2."
2,Field Manual for public,"This book could be cosiderbly shorter, it covers los of facts but with too much detail. It was a chore to read the book to its end, I consider it on a par with a boring military field manual."
3,"""A detailed, informative reference""","Provides history on the development of the concepts, weapons, and the teams and training programs that make up what the snipers and their group do today. Some interesting details in the history of the development of the snipers, but few first-hand accounts included. Also provides a great review of past and current sniper-related books and manuals, as well as detailed appendices concerning the employment, weapons, and training schedules for snipers."
4,"Good Factual history, without the superman bull!","Mr. Lanning has done a good job of discribing the history of the snipers in Vietnam. He is one of the only authors to include information on the enemy snipers, VC/NVA. Mr. Lanning does not go into wonderful 'superman stories' you read, and now see so much of in other works. While 'Lone Wolf' actions, and miracle shots did happen, Mr. Lanning points out that these were far from the normal operations under taken by both the Army and the Marines. This is a good book that can be easily understood by anyone, no military background needed to decode the cryptic language. The only real flaw I found was the lack of knowledge in what to capitalize. Mr. Lanning is obviously a fan of the Enlisted Marine, since he cannot seem to capitalize the title Army, or Officer. It is sad that a work of such completeness suffers from such unprofessional behavior. Does not say much for Ivy Books either. All in all still worth reading."
3,Very Dry.,"Not a very exciting book. Lots of statistics and facts about the formation of sniping units. If that is what you are looking for then this is the book for you.Ed Kugler's review is right on the money but I enjoyed Ed's book ""Dead Center: A Marine Sniper's Two-Year Odyssey in the Vietnam War"" much more. I respect both authors for their service to our country.Thanks Guys!"
5,Helpful,"If you're to own a pocket handbook, this one and the peripheral nerve book are the ones to have handy. It's high yield information when you just need to look up a quick thing when you're seeing a patient."
2,Not nearly as good as the Mass General Medicine Handbook,"I got this book hoping for the same quality as the Mass General Medicine Handbook (the red one, Sabatine) but have been very disappointed. The Neuro handbook is not nearly as helpful as the Medicine handbook. It is disorganized, so it is very difficult to find the information you are looking for. It is incomplete; entire classes of disease are missing and even in the ones that are included there is often important information missing. Usually the information that is in the book is not the type of information that you would need to reference in the middle of the night as a house officer on call. Unlike the Medicine handbook which is thoroughly referenced with landmark studies, this handbook has very few if any useful references. It's still in my coat pocket, but I have more or less given up trying to get any help out of it because it rarely has what I need. In summary, I haven't found anything better yet, but I guess I'll keep looking."
3,Med student review,I just finished my neurology clerkship and I carried this every day and never used it. It's just not something you really need as an ms3. Maybe it would be good for a resident or intern but idk. The only thing I thought was good about it is that my attending seemed impressed that i had it so I guess it was good in that regard. It seemed like it would have been good if I was actually trying to make treatment decisions but I wasn't so I didn't use it.
1,AWFUL!!!!!!,"This is the WORST product!!!! If you notice, all of the positive reviews are from at least a few years ago. Sally Hanson has since changed the formula. The original formula (which is discontinued and cannot be found anywhere) was amazing. Never streaked, sweat off. It made your legs look and feel flawless. I used it religiously for years until they came out with a new formula. It sweats off, smears on your clothes, chairs etc (I left an embarrasing orange powdery streak on my friends black leather car seats), and it just feels thick and sticky on your legs. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY UNLESS SALLY BRINGS THE ORIGINAL FORMULA BACK! You'll see the same kind of review as mine if you look on the Sally Hanson website itself. Awful product when it was once so amazing."
2,Like a TV Turkey -- dark golden orange,"You know how a turkey on TV looks? All dark orangey brown? That's what my leg looked like when I put this stuff on it. It's DARK CRAZY ORANGE, like back in the 80's when albino white girls would put on that dark orange self tanner -- it's like that. Maybe my mistake was that I just picked a color that was too dark, but really even if I had a nice summer tan this stuff would still be WAAAAAAAAAAAAY too dark. Maybe if you're a light skinned african american, this stuff would look rockin' hot on you, but white girls: don't do it. I'm going to try the lightest shade they have and see if that does it. Out of curiosity I had put on 3 layers of this stuff and it did mask my leg veins really well, so I'm hoping the light version of this stuff works, but really, if you have the money pay extra and order the Air Stockings brand -- it's a guaranteed winner. This SH stuff is just a cheap imitation of the real thing."
3,Just okay,"I didn't notice that this product really did anything spectacular. I found it to be orangey and not provide coverage as expected. I could still see leg veins as if they had never been covered up. This would definately not cover up a tattoo either.I liked the whole spray can idea, but what's the point when I have to spray it into my hands first then apply? I might as well have bought a tanless lotion and avoided spraying the floor and everywhere else.Happy with the quick shipping though. I'm sure this works great for many people, but it didn't do so well for me."
5,Best looking cover up if ever!,"I started using this product a few days ago because I had to go to a wedding and my dress was short and I feel very uncomfortable showing my legs, due to the fact I have some scar and marks on my legs. This product is A breeze to apply on your skin! Shake well and spray area of interest and I was amazed on how well it covered my marks and how you barely noticed my scars! I couldn't believe the results it gave me. The shimmer is amazing too!It was so easy, it was even, glowing, and the texture once on body was absolutely amazing. Best of all it didn't stain my clothes, hands. And did I say it's water resistant? Yes It Is! This lightweight leg makeup, contains Palmaria Extract, enhances the coverage of freckles, veins and imperfections. Whoo Hoo!Now you can give your legs a makeover in just seconds. No sun. No salon. No streaks. Just flawless-looking, irresistible, sexy legs."
1,Depends on skin color,"I'm a mideastern woman,with very white skin and dark hair. I don't recommend this product for others like my skin color. When I apply this product to my skin,it turns to an ugly orange color that differs completely from my hands and face color. My legs appeared as someone else's , not as mine. I think it will work with women of darker skin."
3,tantan,I really like your product. But unfortunately it doesnt last as long as I would like. All over the sheets and clothes. Could it be made to last longer thanx Trisha
3,i love hannah howell but.....,"a hannah howell book never takes me more then a couple of hours to read because i can't put it down. i am sorry to say this book took me much longer because it bored me. the hero and heroine didn't seem to spend that much time together to fall in love and even after he got his memory back he still doubted her and the only thing they had going for them was sex.also, their families got on my nerves!they were always in their business! when they would have an arguement and one would follow the other to try and resolve it, here comes the family with their two cents. i have all of this author's books and i have to say i was waiting for this one. i am one of those that have to read the hole series before i read the new book so that is what i did.i went all the way to the begining, what 8 books ago? and reread them. i am disappointed Ms Howell"
2,One More Thing,"I already reviewed this book, but I forgot to mention one other thing that made it implausible. There is no way Jodine - a CANADIAN law student studying CANADIAN law would get a job at an AMERICAN law firm - she wouldn't be admitted to practice in America. Heck - if you're a lawyer admitted to the New York bar and move to another state, if you've been practicing less than seven years, you will most likely have to take that state's bar! Mylenowski needs to do her homework."
3,Enjoyable,"The story kept me involved from start to finish. I wanted to figure out what sort of mess these girls would get themselves into next. I really liked the way that each chapter provided a different perspective. It certainly proves the point that no two people see things the exact same way.Other reviewers said that the characters annoyed them. I can understand that. At some parts you just want to shake a character and ask, ""why did you do that?"" But, for the most part, their flaws are what keeps the book interesting.I almost gave this book 4 stars because I did enjoy the story, but poor editing knocked my rating down a notch."
2,Vapid and boring,"This book is dull and stupid. I was encouraged by a review that said this book looks like ""chick lit"" from the outside but that it actually offers a very honest account of female friendships.Not. True.The jokes are predictable, the plot is predictable, none of the protagonists are likeable, and the author rambles in a way that is supposed to be coy and cute but is ultimately annoying."
3,Disappointing,I wasn't all that impressed with this book. I enjoy a good romantic comedy except that this book just didn't seem all that funny. The characters were annoying and slightly unbelievable. The book lacked any element of surprise or innovation.
5,Buy This Book!,"Refreshing rotating character perspective, well written, compelling story line and a little sex - what else could you ask for in a book? Fishbowl is an excellent follow-up to Mlynowski's Milkrun - she's clearly showing her progress as a writer (and a hotty - nice picture). This book is well worth the read...."
4,A good read,I really liked this book. The middle dragged a bit but i was very pleased overall. Much better than Milkrun - i would definitely recommend Fishbowl.
4,I enjoyed this more than Milkrun,"I read Milkrun before I read this novel. I was very disappointed by Milkrun, so I was hesitant to try another novel by this author. However, I was much more into this novel.I think the characters were fun, kind of an odd bunch, and the story was a little less than run of the mill. They face a challenge together, and have to figure out how to fix it as a group, growing a little closer during the process.It's a fun look at roommates, the trials and the joys!"
3,weak and unbelievable,"The characters and their relationships were totally unbelievable. Everybody was really irritating. Overall, a weak story. Not even a good beach read..."
2,not much to it,"It is only about 6 inches on a side. I thought there would be more to it. I don't think that it will hold a child's attention very long, and it isn't even much fun for an adult."
4,great fight scenes...,"...not always great plot. Overall this is a good movie. I really enjoyed the fighting in this movie. Of course the character of Wong Fei Hung is one of legend in Hong Kong cinema. And as usualy he is cast as a mischeiveous youth. but when push comes to shove, he's a serious young man and a hero to his people. I think the character is in line in this movie with most portrayals I've seen of the young Wong Fei Hung.As for the movie overall, I enjoyed it. It was fun. the fight scenes are excellent. Particular the one at the end between Liu, and Wang. It's one of my favorites. I am currently searching for a copy in the original Cantonese, and I'm sure that the better the copy, the more enjoyable this movie will be to watch. It you enjoy Shaw Brothers films or if you are a collector this one should be in your collection."
2,Do the Chinese strategize better?,"Most of the Overseas Chinese who control business empires attended village schools and were not well-versed with classical Chinese strategies. Most Chinese strategies (those emanating from the old world) despised business and persecuted it. This book is a tenuous attempt to apply stuff ""Chinese"" to modern business situations. I thought we (I am of Chinese descent myself) were beyond that at this point. There is absoutely no evidence that the Chinese have better strategies -- and some evidence that business is difficult to conduct there. This book is little help and lot of hype."
4,Energetic Anti-Depressive Melancholic,"Mr.Atkins wrote an interesting piece of work. As a friend I found it very intriguing to read about myself, even though certain facts seem to be different in my vast realms of memory.No doubt that his life and dreams has been affected be his restless soul, an never ending search for satisfaction and gratitude for the person he REALLY is, that true self that seldom could be seen unless you had X-ray eyes, hidden behind that mask of optimism and enthusiasm, which could make even the growth of grass seem like the most exciting event of the year.A raw view of a time in his life, but for Mr. Atkins it seemed to be hard to admit the truth to himself...that even the most poetic visioners tend to see the faults in others rather than inside themselves and find ways to justify their own mistakes. It's human. It's fresh. It's tough. But it's a great lesson."
2,I beg to differ,"Don't have this CD, and I'm glad I don't, frankly. I have to disagree with the glowing reports here. From what I can tell (granted, only from these clips), this album sucks. It has none of the freshness and out-rght balls of the originals. I mean, we practically drove to Barstow looking for the young lady who inspired that song! Of course, gas was under 50 cents a gallon and we could get there and back in a few hours (after hitting the MacDonalds, actually), but the originals don't need remaking, folks. I say dig 'em out, put 'em on the old stereo or computer or iPod and crank it up! Sorry, have to give this one only two stars, and that's being generous.Sign me,A guy who saw them live and in color three times when we all were young"
4,Good Gunne Jo Jo,"WOW! Just got this one. Reunion albums are always tricky. I was a fan back in the day and what a FANTASTIC reunion album. Unlike another reviewer, I find the recording sharp and clear (like being in the room as it was being recorded). Clear separation and great mix. Dude, you may want to check the wiring on your stereo. The songwriting and performances (even on the re-makes) is better than I expected. Sounds more like they took 3 years off, not 30. I so sorry I waited so long to pick this up. Rock On guys!!"
4,An Alright Drama,"It was interesting and beautiful. The acting looked like acting...this is not the documentary it looks like. If some of the performances had not occasionally distracted me into rembering I was watching a movie, I'd have given it 5 stars."
5,A FABULOUS Mass,"If you love Mozart's Missae Brevis, or Joseph Haydn's masses, this missa conducted by Domonkos Heja is a MUST HAVE. I think it is Michael's best missa, and the interpretation by Huja is spot on. It is lively, reverend and inspired, one of the absolute best 18th century works, in the style of Mozart. I enjoy it even more than Mozart's missae brevis, and he was no slacker when it comes to liturgical works. Not at all stodgy or dull, this vivacous mass would be my pick if I were ever elected Pope and I needed a mass for my coronation! (My first act as Pope would be to lift the exclusivity of Gregorian Chant at papal functions.) Anyone who loves 18th Century Masses should secure a copy. Very Highly recommended."
5,Great for home use,"This shredder shreds everything I throw at it. I only use it for sensitive mail and small documents, but have never had it overheat or otherwise quit on me. A few pieces of paper do escape the bin, but nothing excessive. While it seems flimsy, when it is all snapped together with the bin pushed in all the way at the top and bottom (it snaps into place) the whole thing is pretty solid. I put an 8 gallon trash bag in to make emptying easier. The wheels could be useful, but I didn't install them. The drawer design is fantastic because you don't ever have to lift the heavy shredder off the bin or set it down anywhere where it could make a mess. Convenient, meets all my demands, and my fingers are still intact.Edit Feb 9, 2013: Still going strong. I might run some oil soaked newspaper through it if it has any problems, but so far I haven't had to do anything."
2,Avoid,"The container bin would not stay in place which causes security sensor to disconnect, the whole thing is made out of flexy plastic, parts do not fit tight. Great look though if only build quality was better, reasonably quiet, fine shred, got mine at Costco [...]"
2,"Unless you like a mess, don't buy this one","We were looking for an inexpensive shredder for home use. Thought this would fit the bill but we were mistaken. Looks nice but if you do any volume of shredding at all, you will be frustrated by the mess that ensues every time that you go to empty it. Pull out the drawer and shredded paper goes everywhere. So unless you don't mind picking up lots of little pieces of paper, you might want to find another alternative."
1,The worst shredder I have ever owned,"I have never been so frustrated with a product ever .... you hold your life in your hands when you deal with this machine, and I am not exaggerating.The pros - it was one of the cheapest out there, now I know why.The cons: The machine has a piece that sticks into the bag as you pull the shreds out - never been able to do it without paper all over the floor. It is almost impossible to get the top off to empty the bag; I scream and fight my way each time .... we have another one in the house that is so easy to use, so quiet, easy to empty etc ...When it is full, the top POPS OFF THE MACHINE; erego more paper all over the floor.I have just had my last fight with it, which made me write this review. It is a nightmare machine; spend the extra $10 and buy one that doesn't have these problems .............."
3,Bin Release Tab on Bottom,"We, like others, purchased this shredder from Costco and everything was going okay until it was time to empty the paper bin. After TWO days of pulling and trying we finally, on accident, realized that there is a bin release tab is on the bottom of the shredder. You need to pull the bin with one hand and push in the tab on the bottom on the shredder with the other."
1,Terrible design!,"The shredder itself works great and we have had no problems with that. But the design of the bin is TERRIBLE. First, it is not designed for use with a bag. There is a prong that sticks out into the shredding area that will catch on the bag when trying to remove. You end up tearing the bag and paper shreds spilling all over. Second, there is no gauge to tell you when it's getting full so if you over do it, when you pull out the bin paper shreds go all over, literally. I have learned my lesson and will look at shredder design when I purchase my next shredder."
1,Stopped Working Second Day,"Bought without reviewing first as I needed a replacement shredder and I've been pleased with vast majority of products carried at the big box store where I bought it. Worked first day, but then blades would not go forward on second day, only reverse. CD/diskette slot would not work either. Tried reseating basket multiple times thinking the safety latch was not engaged, but it could not be positioned any better than I had it. Online search suggests burnt winding in motor or defective PCB. To add insult to injury, could not get motor off the top to repack in box. It's going back to the big box store from whence it came NOT to be replaced by the same."
1,Defective Right Out of the Box,"After feeding fewer than 10 sheets of paper through this shredder (one at a time), it inexplicably quit working. There is no paper jam, so it must be a sensor issue (it will go neither forward nor reverse). The customer service representative told me to try unplugging it for half an hour, then returning it to the store if it did not work. Not the start I was hoping for."
2,"Bad Quality, Messy, Underpower...looks good","Every paper you shredder take you 2 hours (a little exaggerated, but not much) to clean up."
1,Would not recommend,"I just purchased this machine and used it for the first time, it seems a little flimsy for the price, the front bin does not close tight and stay shut. I have also scratched up the front trying to remove the sticker. It amazes me that manufactures put stickers on their products that will not peel off."
1,Brand new and it will not release the full bin,I just purchased this last week from Costco. I try to empty the bin and the safety catch will not release the bin. I called customer support and spoke with someone that I am sure was in India. He kept telling me to pull gently down.. Helllooo... the bin will not come out!
3,Barely Adequate for Light Duty,"Lasts about ten minutes under continuous use, then shuts down on overload. Suitable for light use when Grandma wants to shred her monthly electric bill. Flimsy plastic construction with small container that leaves a couple of handfuls of shredded paper behind that fall to the floor each time you empty a full basket. It's going back."
1,One of the teeth broke after few uses,"I bought it from costco. After few weeks of moderate use, one of the teeth broke. Now, the paper gets stuck every so often and i have to clean it out by hand.This shredder is not good"
1,Do Not Buy,This shredder did not last. The shredding area broke off in the middle and this meant that we needed to put all papers to one side in order to try and shred them. Ended up throwing it out and bought another one.
1,abysmal,"This was one terrible piece of crap. Just as horrible as the tv series. DO NOT waste your money on this or your life for that matter. I wasted 117 minutes of my life on this mess, 117 minute I'll never get back. You have been warned."
5,Not a bad film,"I saw this film when it premiered, and I thought it was really good. I saw episodes of Eureka Seven, and I knew it was going to be different, since it was stated before the film premiered. The characters are changed somewhat and the story is very different. However, I was really touched how much the two main characters cared for eachother. I enjoyed it and I would defintely see this movie again."
2,"'Good Night, Sleep Tight' Lacks the Heart of the Original Series","As has been said in other reviews, I believe that the BONES team attempted to crowbar too much story into too little time, and because of that I think the story lacked the heart of the original series. There are a lot of things about the film that are awkward for viewers who know the original story, such as the recasting of characters, recycling of old footage, the simultaneous connection/disconnection between the film and original series. Consequently, I spent the majority of the film trying to get past these issues instead of being able to enjoy the film for what it was. If there were more time to adjust to these changes by perhaps creating a two-part film or a short mini-series instead of a single feature-length film, these issues may not have been a problem for me. On the positive side, Naoki Sato has composed a completely new score for this film that lives up to his previous work."
1,This Crap Isn't Reviewable,"I recently purchased this cd by Barbria Deanne and was mildly impressed. I am always looking for new talent to hire and develop so I thought I would contact her. I mean there is possibility in all of us. I had to do some research on her only to find out that she is full of all kinds trouble. She claims to have done some extensive touring, including a ""World Tour"". She has hardly been out of Georgia. The reason I have written this review is to warn you that Brabria Deanne is not a nice person and should not be supported by buying her barely, maketable ""music""."
2,Not much heat,This heater barely puts out any heat. Might be good for a very small place but did nothing to help in the car.
2,Works... when it works.,"I bought two of these as window defoggers for my old Aerostar. Along with the backward-labeled switch (all of them are like this), the unit heater coils cut out after a while. The internal connections are pressed into place, and the fan shakes enough when running that they eventually vibrate loose. Then all you have is a noisy fan. Until then, I found that two correctly-aimed units were enough to keep the windshield from fogging up. Unfortunately, both broke down within a week of use.I recommend shoppers look around a bit more. There HAS to be something designed and assembled with a bit more care."
4,Excellent item,"Since my defroster was not working very well on my pick up, I ordered this to sit on dash for the winter. Works great."
2,too small,"Purchased for my father's truck that had a leaking heater core. This item was too small to put out real heat, barely defrosted one spot on the windshield. Would not recommend if you need real heat"
1,heater,another piece of crap that needs to be taken off the market.... I can't beleive they would sell something like this.
1,broke twice,"Did not work when I got it, so they replaced it now this one broke after 2 months. would like to get it replaced"
5,satisfied,"i use it almost every day it works great and i love it, i am very satisfied with this item,it keeps me warm in the cold"
1,Junk. Waste of money.,This item is extremely poor quality and barely works at all..Please don't waste your money...You'd be better off breathing on your windows.
1,Save your money,"Doesn't get very hot, very noisy, cheaply made and the fan and heater switch on mine are reversed. Don't waste your time and money on this car heater."
1,crap,Don't buy it. Wast of money. Better off fixing the heater core. I thew it back in the box and hate that I wasted my money on this crap.
3,Pre-owned?,"I will just preface this by saying I have yet to use this heater. I will write another review once I do, but I needed to get something off my chest. The item arrived in its original box unsealed. There was no paperwork, receipt or manual included and the product was obviously not ""new"" The package itself says 2006 in big numbers on the front of the box. And the cord was wrapped around the product like you would wrap the cord around your hair dryer. It was not wrapped like any other new item's cord would be, back and forth with a twist tie around it. So this leads me to believe that I got a slightly used product. No one told me that when I bought it. If it works then fine, but it was returned for a reason so I can only hope..."
2,Not that good.,"Smaller than I thought.The switch is wired backwards. To set it to heat you have to set it to fan, and to set it to fan you have to set it to heat. I ordered two of these, one for a gift and one for me. The other one is a gift, so I'll have to warn them or hope it works right."
4,Validation for what you probably already know,"Unlike a lot of books with this theme, this one seems to do a good job of ferreting out the different ways that people deal with chronic illness. It is appropriate for most people with chronic illness, although it does focus on ""invisible chronic illness"". I was impressed that there were few places that made me want to roll my eyes and toss the book across the room. Usually books like this are filled with cheesy advice, such as ""take time out for yourself"" and ""a good bubble bath can do wonders for your psyche"". This one is written on a more intelligent level and talks about the real issues and challenges that face people with chronic illness and their caregivers."
4,I like it,"We use this every day. I love to make panini's. I purchased this item because of the maker (Cuisinart). There are some things that could be improved. If your sandwich is a little on the thick side, it will push the top bread off the bottom bread and you will have a mess. It's great with Foccocia or ciabatta (spelling?)bread.Panini's are getting popular so I'm sure they will work the problems out."
4,Recommend,"I recommend this panini maker. Just plug it in, wait about 2 minutes for it to heat up (green indicator light) and go! Very easy to clean. My only beef: no temperature control. Don't hesitate on this purchase -- for the price it's a very nice addition to my kitchen. Great for quesadillas and grilled sandwiches."
5,Great Grill,"This panini grill has seen heavy use since I bought it about 2 months ago. I never used a panini grill before, but this grill couldn't be any easier to use. Yes, it does take up space, but its worth it. My family are all grilled cheese sandwich fans. The paninis coming out of this grill are unlike anything we ever produced on our stove with a built in griddle or from a skillet. I think the main difference is the crispness. I have even taken to grilling cheese alone on the grill, absolutely delicious- which brings me to the downside.....weight gain. Perhaps keeping the grill off the counter would slow down grill usage. If you're looking to purchase a grill, we've had no complaints with this one."
3,"Great grilling, small size and curious for washing","I bought my panini maker to replace my George Foreman grill who I thought was uncomfortable and awkward with the grills sometimes falling and making a mess..I was excited to open to package but to my disappointment, the grill size is kind of small for my needs. To put it in perspective, you can grill 2 burgers at the same time, not 3 or 4 like my old Foreman. My husband who is a darling who helps me with the dishes is very apprehensive when he washes this because the grills don't come off like the Foreman grill so he tries for the cable not to get wet but he doesn't always succeed...I would go for something with removable grills that is somewhat larger next time..."
4,Fun Product!,"Fun and easy to use, it will make you create ""out of the box"" panini's! The only downside is the size. You can only fit 2 medium size sandwich's at a time. But difnatley worth it!"
2,Panni - Griddler by Cuisinart,I ordered the Cuisinart Panni maker for a Christmas gift and it was excellent wanted one for myself and it was replaced with this model. It doesn't have the floating top and it not nearly as nice would not order again.
5,Best appliance ever!,"We purchased the Cuisinart GR-1 Griddler Panini and Sandwich PressCuisinart GR-1 Griddler Panini and Sandwich Pressfrom Amazon about two months ago and have used it several times. The panini sandwiches always turn out perfectly browned, heated throughout even with thick filling and the cheese, when included, nicely melted. Every bit as good or better than any restaurant panini I've had. This appliance goes so far beyond doing sandwiches stovetop in a pan that there is no comparison. LOVE IT!"
5,Very nice.,Nice Cuisinart Panini grill. Versatile. Use a couple of times a week to make sandwiches. Great product. Easy to use and to clean.
5,Fantastic!,My wife really loved this gift. The quality of the product was very good. I would recommend this product to others.
4,Review of Cuisinart GR-1 Griddler Panini and Sandwich Press,"The Cuisinart GR-1 Griddler Panini and Sandwich Press is everything I'd hoped it be!It is simple to use, effective and a great addition to the kitchen!"
3,Cusinart GR-1 Griddler Panini and Sandwich Press,"This product works fine - heats and grills a great sandwich. I wish I had known there is no temperature control, only ""on"" and ""off"". I also wish it could remain plugged in while off. Otherwise, a nice product."
2,smaller than what you think,"i didn't think that it would be that small, but hey, for the price, i got kinda tricked into thinking it'd be bigger than it really is, working fine though."
3,Love it but it isn't the most fuctional,"After being used frequently for a year or so we upgraded to a small toaster oven and haven't pull it out since. Its good at grilled cheese and panni's and not much else. No on or off switch didn't bother us at all, but not easy to clean."
4,"Great, used daily","I bought this sandwich press because I loved paninis in Iraq and knew I'd need them when I got home.This press has matched my bachelor lifestyle perfectly. It heats up by the time I've prepped my sandwich, cooks evenly and at the perfect temperature. It feels solid, and after a year of near daily use hasn't aged a bit.-1 star since you can't adjust temperature. You might consider a foreman grill for more versatility in the same price range.I love this product, and highly recommend it for sandwich lovers."
4,"Good Sized, Works Fast","This panini press has two distinct advantages over larger and more expensive models--namely, it is smaller and less expensive! As panini are usually made one at a time anyway, getting a multi-sandwich sized machine is just a waste of counter and storage space. This press has room for two sandwiches if you want to cook more than one at a time, but it is compact and easy to put away. It heats up quickly, and works like a waffle iron--one light says ready to go, the other says wait a minute. Pretty simple.The floating handle provides even pressure on sandwiches, which come out warm and deliciously crunchy. One warning for households with small kids--the whole unit (except for the handle) gets pretty hot.This is a satisfactory low cost panini maker that is perfect for singles, couples, or even small families."
1,Don't buy this model,"The GR1 works just fine but it is impossible to clean and there is no temperature control. Those are it's faults.You can buy the GR35 at Costco for $39, it is the same size and it has an on off switch with temperature control,and the plates are removable and flat on one side.I did not like sandwiches that were like waffels when you heat them from the grooved side of the plate. I use the smooth side so they look like they were done in a pan. If you think wiping out grooves is easy just try it for it is not.With the temperature control you can slow heat the sandwich so the whole sandwich gets hot rather then just the outside.To turn on the GR1 you must pull the plug in and out of the wall each time, this is just wrong, it will arc each time you do it, this is hard on the wall side and will wear it out. A very bad way to control anything electric.Get the GR35.My GR1 is going on ebay."
2,hard to clean,"[[ASIN:B000CPZXGO Cuisinart GR-1 Griddler Panini and Sandwich PressThese were given as gifts and while they do what they were susposed to do, cleaning was a problem. A tooth brush was handy for cleaning."
2,Cuisinart GR-1 doesn't toast the same on both sides,I was disapointed with the Cuisinart GR-1 Griddler Panini Press after trying it one time. The top side of the sandwich grilled nicely and left toasted grill marks. The bottom side of the sandwich was soft and did not toast the same. Even the grill marks were less noticeable on the under side of the sandwich. It's as if the heat was unevenly distributed. I had to return it.
5,"Great grill, even if not for panini","When my Foreman grill died about 3 years ago I replaced it with the Griddler because it fit perfectly in my miniscule cooking area and the Foreman models didn't.But I have yet to grill a sandwich with it. I use it several times a week for chops, steaks, and chicken legs, frozen French fries, zucchini and the like -- whatever I need to grill.I don't usually give 5-star reviews, but I have no complaints. Well, it does get greasy and is not the easiest item to clean, but the Foreman wasn't, either. When the Griddler dies, I'll get another."
5,dognpooch,"Love this product. Bought several for Christmas gifts and everyone loved it. Nice size, fits into cupboard perfectly!Mail delivery was very fast."
5,You'll love it!,"We used to make grilled cheese sandwiches on a stove-top griddle. Not any more! This little press does it better, cleaner, more consistently and with a less energy than our griddle.We've used this for over a year now. It's nice looking, sturdy, inexpensive, and easy to use. What's NOT to like?"
3,Not quite as advertisd,"Product advertised as having ""removable non-stick griddles."" Well... they may be non-stick, but they are not removable for cleaning... and you are instructed to not dip the entire unit in water. So... beware the advertisement !!"
3,bellybomb,"the only thing it is good fore is toasting buns on a sandwicth, the filling does not even get hot."
4,Very nice!,I gave this as a Christmas gift for my daughter along with a Panini cook book. She absolutely loved it. It works very well.
3,Great press but hard to clean,"The panini press works very well. Unfortunately, though, the plates are non-removable and very hard to clean, as the entire thing (of course) can't be submerged in water--only surface cleaned or painstakingly rinsed. PBJ sticks in the grooves, and oil collects there as well. If I had it to do over, I would definitely purchase a press with removable top and bottom plates."
5,Cuisinart Panini and Sandwich Press,I used the Panini and Sandwich Press this evening. It worked great. The sandwiches were perfect. This is a quality product.
4,Cusinart,Cusinart makes some nice things. This product is very good. I once had a cusinart toaster that was garbage but this product makes great paninis and is holding up well.
5,Wonderful Bistro Style,"This thing is wonderful... the kids favorite is peanut butter and honey. I love a nice basil,tomato,provalone and olive oil panini. The things you can make are really endless.. some of the things we have tried are BLT, Tuna, plain ol ham and cheese is actually a meal in this thing, it also makes great crustini to go along with a salad. It is great for a fast light summer supper. But I can't wait to have a nice grilled cheese with some tomato soup in the winter. I have even grilled up portabella sandwiches (for a low carb dieter)that came out wonderful.It is small enough to put away (but pretty enough not to have to)when it isn't in use. And so simple to use that my 11 year old son can break it out and use it."
3,Works fine but needs a off and on switch,Love the sandwich it makes but needs a off and on switch so you do not need to reach over it and pull the plug.
5,New Things to Eat,"I was looking for something to make some new and different things for dinner when I noticed this panini maker. I've tried it a couple of times, and each time it has made a yummy sandwich and/or quesadilla. It's easy to use and to clean. It only takes a few minutes for the sandwich to cook."
4,"Great, but really too small","I got this as a Christmas gift and love the grill - it heats up quickly, heats sandwiches evenly, and makes some tasty treats. It's also not too bad to clean. My only complaints about it are that it's a bit too small and the floating hinge doesn't open quite wide enough for a really thick sandwich. If I had to do it over, I'd ask for a bigger one. But I am generally happy with this one and it would be perfect for a single person or a couple."
2,No so great,"If you like your panani to look like a sandwich, don't get this press. It's lousy. The ""hinge"" can hardly be called such, as it only allows for about a sandwich made of bread with no fixings. Then trying to close it is a nightmare. The sandwich falls apart. VERY frustrating. Also, the plates may be removable for cleaning, but they don't come clean in the dishwasher. My kids got me one at Meijer last year, died in December. I bought this for myself. Should have stuck with the cheaper one. I am going to attempt to get my money back and purchase the same kind I had before."
2,not worth the money,when i read the reviews about the sticker.. i thought why is the sticker becoming such a big deal.. we it isVERY hard to peel off..the quality of the machine is good.. but the way it works is not so good.. the top heats your sandwich more than the bottom..I WOULD RECOMMEND A PANNINI MACHINE THAT YOU CAN TAKE THE TRAYS OUT OF TO WASH.. you cannot take the pans off of this one and it is very hard to clean it.. i returned it and bought the West band pannini maker its really a lot better than this :)
1,Disappointing,This press doesn't seem to work well. The top browns much more quickly than the bottom. Clean up isn't all that easy. I was surprised by how small the grill surface was.
5,Awesome,"Love this press, works great for small or big sandwiches and cooks perfectly and quickly. Want to try grilling chicken and hamburgers but not sure how well it will work."
3,Pros and Cons,"We've had this panini press over 6 months now. It has performed well and the kids love it. However, I have two pet peeves:1) There is no on/off switch. Inconvenient. With any appliance that heats up, this could be a safety issue. Also, since ours gets a lot of use, the constant plugging/unplugging has resulted in a loose switchplate in our tiled counter backsplash.2) It's difficult to clean thoroughly. You can wipe it off after each use, but after a while there IS going to be a buildup of charred grease, crumbs, whatever. Not very healthy."
3,GR-1 griddle works only on top side,"We purchased Cuisinart GR-1 Griddler Panini and Sandwich Press and made two paninis. Unfortunately, they didn't turn out as we had hoped: only the top side was well toasted with nice golden brown stripes. The bottom side's stripes were pale, not even pale gold, so we had to flip them over and cook more which made some parts of the toast a bit too dry. We tried again later on giving more time for heating to see if we had not let the machine heat up enough at first time, but we got the same result.If the panini maker cost $18-20, we would probably ignore the problem and keep flipping the paninis, but for $49.99 I would rather have one that works properly. So we are returning it."
4,Cuisinart Gridler 1 panini press,"Limited use so far, but the sandwiches were good and all was as advertised. Yes, it would be nice to be able to remove the grill plates. However, I'd like the manufacturer to know that the stuck-on label, which had to be removed, did not come off willingly and even after the gluey residue was rubbed off, a ""ghost"" impression remained on the lovely surface. Cuisinart.com does not have an easy way for one to give this kind of feedback."
5,Great Panini Press,"Absolutely love this. Makes great sandwiches, easy to clean. The outside does get very hot, so be aware of that. Oh, and it also cooks bacon really well. I highly recomend."
1,Very bad it's an American plug so we can't use it,This should be stated when buying because its impossible for us to use in uk hope we get a full refund and postage because its 80 pounds to return
5,great sandwich maker,this panini press is $50 cheaper than ones in the store and it does the same thing. It's a much better buy than the stores.
5,Love this tiny machine!,I have had this for two days and have used it four times! Works quickly and without butter to make great tasting sandwiches. I am glad I chose to purchase this one with the NON removable plates. I feel like if they could be removed I would have thrown them in the dishwasher and ruined them or worse... they would have been sitting in the dishwasher waiting for me to run the load when I needed it. I got mine a bit cheaper than it's now listed for but I would buy it all over again. No regrets!
4,i would buy it again11,"great for the price. makes a great, evenly grilled sandwiches.for home use its perfect.i would buy for gifts for anyone i know.as soon as we got it,on time,we used it 4 days in a row. it makes the best paninni sands. especially if you use fresh baked french or italian bread, superb1 also fill up the sand. cuz the melt overs dont stick."
5,Love it!,I bought this for my teenage son to make sandwiches and he loves it! Faster than the stovetop and so convenient. The results are excellent and encourages him to cook! I am all for that.
5,Delicious!!!!,After reading the reviews I went ahead and bought the panini maker. It is a great machine and all my kids love it. It turns regular sandwiches into delicious meals! Very easy to use and to clean. Highly recommend!!!!
4,So far so good!,"My husband and I have wanted a panini press for a while. I finally ordered this one based on so many good reviews. So far we've been happy with this press. It's a little smaller than I would like. It's fine for us but I don't think it would work well for a group of more than 2-4 people. It's good for making two average bread sized sandwiches. We've had a little trouble with bulky, crusty breads. I'm still glad I ordered it and I think it will get many years of use. The paninis we've made have been super yummy!"
2,"High-tech, low entertainment","It used to be that Sharon McCone drove around in a car, gathering clues, using her brain to solve simple, but riveting mysteries. Now she flies a plane, uses computers, her boyfriend is an ex-mercenary who's a partner in a high-tech security firm...What happened to simplicity in mysteries? McCone has gone the way of Scarpetta, who used to be a medical examiner but now seems to be an international solver of terrorist activity. If you need a McCone fix, read one of the old books. Or better yet, Ms. Muller, simplify, simplify..."
4,"Great read, however, start from the beginning","Here is another great read from Muller. She has yet to dissapiont, unlike so many others that we have become accustomed to reading in this catagory. If you are just beginning with her, please start at the beginning of the series. While the ending was mildly anti-clamatic, her only better works were: ""Double"" and ""Where echoes live."" Muller is not a 'Sue Grafton,' her stories are not tired an weak. Muller still tells a wonderful story."
4,Marcia Muller Comes Thorough Again,"Just finished Muller's latest - While Other People Sleep - and thoroughly enjoyed it. Muller continues to grow and develop her characters. Even after 19 books, Sharon McCone and her colleagues maintain this reader's attention. The book had great atmosphere. Muller's suberb touch with characterization make it an excellent book to enjoy by the pool, on the beach or curled up at home with a glass of chardonnay."
4,Another McCone mystery hits on target,"While Other People Sleep, like the last half dozen Sharon McCone mysteries show a writer at her economic best. No lengthy descriptions or unnecessary verbiage clutter the California landscape that Sharon traverses in her search for an imitator, and terrorizer, of her life. The story moves swiftly and smoothly, with the all too familiar creepy horror of the current scourge of society - the stalker - hanging over every move our protagonist makes. Marcia Muller always keeps McCone fresh and alive for her readers, and we'll hopefully enjoy her investigations for another twenty years."
5,Keep them coming,"Sharon McCone in While Other People Sleep faces what seems to be a problem that is becoming more prevelant in our society. Stalkers and those who are intolerant of other's lifestyles are gaining more and more power and there is little anyone can do about it. I have read all the books in this excellent series and hate to wait the year it takes for the next one to come out in hardback. I sat down and read it pretty much in one sitting. The characters are well developed.I recommend that a reader new to the series start back a few titles, or maybe from the very beginning. The stories are well worth the time and energy it will take to read all 19.I hope the year passes quickly and we see the developments in all the varied relationships revealed in these books.Good work."
4,Rendezvous: After Dusk,"Fantastic condition, just like new. Received very quickly in great packaging. Very Satisfied, will purchase from this person again and again."
4,Very Thorough for a wicca 101,"I really liked this book. It is very informative for the beginning witch, with a few rituals, spells and visualizations to get you started. It by no means is the difinitive book on wicca, but it is a very good place to start as it doesn't bore you with history, or overwhelm you with a lot of jargon."
3,This compilation is a travesty,"The track selection on this CD is a joke. Lots of great tunes are omitted (including everything from their best album ""Three Miles High"") and yet a few second-rate tracks are included. It should have been easy for anyone familiar with Mass Production to put together a 5-star compilation. Rhino Records doesn't deserve any of your money for this shoddy CD, which is an insult to a talented band."
5,Blazin',This Band is Funky&Smokin' The Grooves hold up really well and they have a tight Horn Section.FireCracker is still one of the baddest Jams ever.they have other jams on here Equally as tight.
2,The Tide of Funk,"I grew up in the 70s and certain songs are a part of that. If you're groovin' in a club on the east coast at that time you had to hear ""Just Wanna Make a Dream Come True""! When you talk about Mass Production, you're talking about ""People Get Up"", ""I Like to Dance"" - songs that emphasize the groups all-embracing horn sections as well the rhythm section. Songs like ""Groove Me"" and ""Sky High"". You would be better off finding the vinyl and burning you own compilation than to buy this cd."
2,What the Heck,"I'm extremely disappointed that ""Nature Lover"" is missing. I'm searching the internet for a download of that song & was praying to find it here."
2,ONE HIT WONDER,FIRECRACKER THATS IT... I GUESS MASS PRODUCTION NEVER GOT PASS THAT ONE HIT ON THE LEFT COAST.. BUT IT WAS A JAM.... VERY BUMPING IN 79....
4,Islands Calling by Magical Strings,"Though I would have liked to have heard a much longer sample of each piece, I did find the listening very enjoyable, a wonderful combination of harps with other instrumentation, each selection setting its own ambiance which kept me alert and carefully listening."
3,"Passive, good entry level monitor","When building my home studio I bought the Tannoy Proto Js off a friend. I was honestly just looking for some speakers, didn't really understand or know why good monitors were necessary, or notice what good monitors sounded like. After I upgraded to active EVENT Studio monitors I noticed better mixes and could hear everything out my 002. I think the major drawback I had with my Tannoy setup was the amp I used (cheap JVC home stereo component receiver). It lacked power and the sound was always muddy... Never transitioned correctly when I played my mixes in the car... In a nut shell, make sure you use a good amp with Tannoy Proto Js. I now have them in my garage hooked up on a 300 watt alpine car amp (yes they knock, but never at 100%)"
5,Inovative book of worthwile flies.,This book opened a new world of flytying materials for me to experiment with. Not to mention the flies also work. It is interesting to find materials in other places besides fly shops ie. craft stores. A great addition to my library.
4,"not essential, but fun","If you tie for fun and not just to produce flies to fish with, you'll enjoy this book. It has patterns for trout, bass and panfish, salmon, and the salt.Who doesn't want to dress up their flies a bit? This is a fun way to to that."
4,Debussy and Ravel by Previn,"Claude Debussy- La Mer- Trois NocturnesLondon Symphony OrchestraAmbrosian Chorus1984-------------Maurice Ravel- Valses nobles et sentimentales- Alborada del graciosoRoyal Philharmonic OrchestraMichael Chapman1986------------Conducted by Andre Previn(EMI Classics - DDD - 1991 compilation)While is it always an iffy proposition to combine pieces from two different composers on a single CD (especially when they are performed by different Orchestras), but this one works well enough. Thankfully, both performances are very good.This is a solid Four Star CD."
4,a collectors book...,"This book truly lives up to its name. You basically have a collection of data on most every category of mech, infantry unit and vehicles in the Mechwarrior: DA universe. The book is primarily an eye-candy book for those Mechwarrior fans who can't get enough. The short story (involving Tamara Duke of the Stormhammer faction and Thos Cardella) is an excellent read which serves to tantalize those who have been reading the DA novels. Astute MW clixers will note that Duke and Cardella were the prizes for the DFA marquee.A must have for avid Mechwarrior collectors. Others should be able to live without it."
2,Crystal is absolute junk - DO NOT BUY UNTIL THEY IMPROVE IT,"I've bought it on sale in Decmber 2006 - less than 3 month later crystal broke WITHOUT ANY IMPACT - and it's NOT covered by their so called ""lifetime warranty"". They claim it be 100m waterproof; with crystal cracking without any pressure at all I call this FALSE ADVERTISEMENT.The rest of watch seems OK - but this defect makes it completely unusable.In over 30 years I've never seen crystal that bad. AVOID."
1,low quality product,"I generally give +ve reviews for most of the products but this one was so bad that there's nothing good that I can say about it. I got a similar Skagen watch from Costco for $79.99 and the top glass broke within a month. No hitting, no abuse, nothing. Just plain and simple use of it. Moreover I wear my watch on the inner side of the wrist which makes it much more safe from coming in contact with any foreign material and reduces the chances of it hitting any foreign surface. Secondly, the outer rim of the watch is full of scratches. Most of these are from it rubbing against the shirt cough buttons. Had it been made of stainless steel, there's no way this would've happenned."
1,The battery got dead in 2 months,Not at all satisfied with this product . Crown came out and the above all watch quality is not good . The battery got dead after 2 months .
1,disappointed,Just received it and came broken out of box. The crown came out and it is not even working.
1,"Not even able to set the time with buttons, manual is not helpful and not worth to spend money on Skagen watches","To whom so concerned,I thought I am going to have good watch from Skagen when i placed the order.After I received the watches, It was useless manual and not even able to set the time with buttons. They are stuck and not rotating properly. I have to wear the watch, just to feel, that I have watch. Not for time. I am pretty sure, Skagen and Amazon should have sold a better product. This is not worth to buy Skagen watches. By spending $10.00 dollars in Walmart I can get watch, if I don't like it is easy to return. But here it is useless to buy online amzon.com if the product is not good.Please make sure that sell good products.Please do let me know if you need any addtional information"
1,Not worth it at all!,"If you are looking for a great looking watch at a nice price, DO NOT buy this watch...I bought one and it arrived the day before my boyfriend's birthday. It was totally broken. Nothing moved, at all. Nothing worked and the rubber strap was uncomfortable and not flexable. I tried to return it and amazon said they were no longer carrying it. I'm not sure why they brought this back, but I assure you it is not worth it...spend a little more money and you will have a lot more success!"
4,Lynette Schultz-remember this name-you'll hear more soon!,"An impressive mix of styles from the multi-talented Ms. Schultz. She writes all her own material, produced the album, and plays all the instruments except the drums.""It's Got To Be You"" should be a hit on the jazz circuit, while ""I'll Be Back Tomorrow"" would fare nicely in pop. ""Coffee"" is a humorous anthem to the latte craze.Her lyrics are meaningful, and her voice rich. I see comparisons to Melissa Manchester & Phoebe Snow. I only bought the album a couple of weeks ago, and am already ready for more; i hope another cd is already in the works!""It's Only Natural"" that we should be hearing much more of Lynette Schultz soon."
1,A disappointment,This video offers very few details on self-defense. It consists mainly of a repetitive (dull and easy) workout and does not provide much information on APPLYING what few techniques are shown. There has to be better self-defense instruction out there. I've gotten more information from random e-mail than I did in this.
5,very good book for beginning investors or more experienced traders,"The author, Mr. Lowell Miller, discusses the power of compounded dividend reinvestment of common stocks. This investment strategy is great for beginning investors and more experienced traders alike.It is hard to go wrong with this book as a first investment book. The author also discusses fundamental analysis, which is the skill of determining how healthy a company is."
2,Condescending missionary writing,"I read this book, which was written in the first half of the 20th century, in an attempt to find out more about Appalachian history and society. It does contain overviews of topography and early settlement that are somewhat useful. But Campbell, although he clearly tries not to be condescending, doesn't succeed. He's a missionary, and his purpose is to bring ""modern civilization"" to an underprivileged region. In discussing how he wants to do this, he never really comes to grips with the unique cultural heritage of the people he's talking about and the ways in which modernization -- his version of which is a sort of clean-cut, upright, Protestant Capitalist dystopia -- would endanger that. I can't really see any reason why a modern scholar would want to read this book."
5,Wonderful album,Their music has grown and evolved. Caveat: this is just them--don't expect it to sound like their old stuff. They are minus the stable of songwriters they had. Each of the Monkees wrote and sang the songs for this album. Circle Sky has even more energy to it than the live cut used in the movie Head. Their voices still sound great. The songs are great. It's hard to single one out as the best on the album.
3,"A nice, original effort","All four Monkees reunited in the mid-1990's to produce -Justus- (meaning ""Just Us""). All tracks are written and recorded by the original four Monkees. The sound is straight rock, quite different from the folk/country/rock style of the Monkees in the 60's. The highlight of the album is Mickey Dolenz, whose tenor vocal is as great for pop music as ever, and he emerges as an excellent songwriter as well. Davy Jones contributes good songs and vocals too. Peter Tork? Well, maybe a few too many drugs in the 60's spoiled whatever talent he had ... his two songs and vocals are awful. The biggest disappointment is the minimal contribution of Mike Nesmith; only two Nez songs appear on the album, and one (""Circle Sky"") was released in the 60's. -Justus- is a fine listen for Monkees fans, but probably not good enough for commercial success."
3,"A welcome surprise from ""just us""","A project (surprisingly) initiated by Mike Nesmith, the Monkees marked their 30th anniversary with an album all their own. I was pleasantly surprised by this; their sound meshes well with the mid-90's. Though I can handle just one Peter Tork vocal, Mike Nesmith lends his voice only to the re-working of ""Circle Sky"". Micky sings of his divorce troubles in ""Never Enough"" and has great vocals on ""Admiral Mike"" and ""Regional Girl"". Davy also scores with ""Oh, What A Night"", and ""You and I"". Let's hope they do it again. Rhino released a ""Justus"" video showcasing several of the songs that those interested might want to check out."
2,Really a disappointment,"Bought the album at a concert and when I got home and listened, I realized why they didn't play any of the new songs live. I love the Monkees as much as any other fan, but I have to say that I listened to JUSTUS once and then I lost the CD. It is now almost 2 years later, and I still haven't tried looking for it."
2,"I Really Wanted to Like This, But...","Somehow it just wasn't working. Much of the problem was the writing-- for me part of the Monkees will be a library of songs by the great writers of the time. Mike fit in that category, and Peter had his moments. Sadly, Mickey and Davey simply don't have much of anything special to add. In retrospect, I'm not sure how I expected this album to work. Nostalgia? Can't ask guys to play as if they haven't gotten decades older. A step forward? Being on the cutting edge is not exactly the Monkee legacy. Ultimately this just doesn't much work. I still love these guys, and I'll still play their old stuff (as do my kids!) but this cd, well, let's just pretend it didn't happen, okay?"
1,Very disappointing,"I had such hopes for this album, being a fan from the 60's, but I can hardly listen to this. The only good thing I can say is it's better than ""Pool It""."
3,Nifty Surprise,"I enjoy hearing the Monkees perform their own instruments (like ""Headquarters""). The bass & keyboards are great throughout and the only weak spot are Dolenz's drums which aren't really horrible but are about as complex as Dennis Wilson's. The hard edge is a very nice surprise and I think the remake of ""Circle Sky"" is much more powerful than the original (not to mention that the lyrics are much more complete). The highlights to me are the 2 Peter Tork songs which are very well written musically. Sure, ""I Believe You"" seems repeatitive upon first listening but grows on you like a mantra. ""Admiral Mike"" and ""Regional Girl"" are also okay but the rest of it is filler in my honest opinion. The only reason I give it 3 stars is again: it's nice hearing the Monkees as a real creative working unit. But all in all, my biggest respect goes for Peter Tork as the most accomplished musician."
2,Not for the casual fan.,"Monkee fans may find some good points on this album. Personally, I liked Admiral Mike and Davy's It's Not Too Late. After that, ouch! Mickey sounds bitter on almost every song he sings, and Peter went the Windham Hill route! There just aren't enough fun rave up songs on this album. And why would they re-do Circle Sky on a reunion album? Stick with Headquarters if you want to know what the Monkees sounded like as a real group."
4,delphi fuel pump,"Good quality pump. Installed it a month ago & so far, so good. Guess my truck has been starving for fuel for quite a while because it runs much better on the top end now. The only thing I didn't like about the pump was changing out the factory harness plug for the new one. Amazon had the best price I could find."
5,Excellent Product,"This is what I should have used instead of some off brand ebay deal. This item came with everything needed for my 2002 V6 Chevy 4x4 pickup. Easy install, Truck started right up."
1,Very Wordy and technical,"I thought this would be more behind the scenes of how to create animation, but the copy I received was about music in animation. It was very wordy, lengthy, and perhaps more for the professional animator, not an amateur or hobbyist."
4,Great buy!,"I ordered this because I hate going into a drugstore and having to be on display when purchasing condoms. I was pleasantly surprised to see that when I ordered three packs of this product I got one third her pleasure, one third lubricted, and one third magnum large. The magnums are particularly expensive (about $13 for 12) so I was thrilled. Also, the package came super fast and was in a plain package....all in all good buy I am pleased"
5,Outstanding Work,"This book taught me more about Ethernet - particularly Gigabit Ethernet - than I thought was possible to learn. It is technical but clear, conversational but detailed and thorough. Unlike other books whose authors claim to be objective, these writers are openly and unabashedly Ethernet ""bigots"" (to use their word). You may not agree with everything they say, but you have to take them seriously.Breyer and Riley have a rare combination of talents: extensive technical knowledge, and the ability to communicate their knowledge in an entertaining and informative style. First rate."
4,A must read for folks who make their living with Ethernet!,"Most of this book was fun to read. It filled in a lot of gaps in my knowledge about Ethernet. The book covers exactly how Ethernet works, and some of the politics behind why it works the ways it does. (Ethernet has a facinating history.) This isn't the book to buy if you are just starting with networking, but I think should be read by every CNE and MCSE who uses Ethernet. (Some of the material DID helped when I took the Cisco CCNA exam!) This is the only source book I've found on nearly every flavor of Ethernet. I think there may be a few minor errors, and of course given the speed at which the industry changes some of the details on Gigabit Ethernet are a little dated. I do look forward to the fourth edition."
1,Factual and typographical errors,"After the third or fouth factual error (I teach Ethernet technologies) and the fifth or sixth typesetting error (missing or partial paragraphs) I finally tracked down the publishing house and told them of my disappointment. They sent out another book (without the typesetting errors), but it didn't set my mind at ease about the factual errors."
5,Jackie's Awesome Voice,I saw my friend Jackie perform live for the first time this weekend and I couldn't believe that she was even better than on the CD. I am such a fan of Jackie's God-given talent! Get her CD today! I can't wait until her new CD comes out.
2,'Kid-world' and 'adult-world',"The nearly incessant references to 'kid-world' and 'adult-world' made this a hard read for me. If you still enjoy the 'Crisis on Multiple Earths' crossovers, you will enjoy this story as well. If the campy silliness of those books now makes you cringe, then skip reading this story."
1,For kids only...even they wouldn't like it.,"It's stories like these that give comics and graphic novels a bad name.The story was bad, the charecters are one dimensional and the artwork did not come from the Joe Kubert schoolof graphic arts. Ignore this book at all costs."

1,A Disappointment,"In Elizabeth Costello, Mr. Coetzee adds his name to the long list of established authors who assemble bits of previous material, tack on a few new thoughts and voila! a new work of art emerges. (See Acknowledgements p. 233) If you want animal rights, Peter Singer will more than suffice. Shame on you Mr. Coetzee for succumbing to the urge to coin more rands."
2,hmmm...,"Graham Greene (who should have won the Nobel prize; it's a Disgrace that he didn't) called his lesser efforts ""entertainments."" Coetzee's lesser efforts could be called ""exercises,"" and would include Diary of a Bad Year, and Elizabeth Costello, his lessest. He must have thought, wouldn't it be interesting if .... er, well, not really, it turns out. Nothing wrong with the format, the set-up, aok; it's what Coetzee does with it, and that's very little. I liked the reveal about the liaison years before with the other lecturer and was hoping for more of the same, maybe more of the relationship with her son ... but it didn't happen. And the Holocuast stuff was very heavy-handed, hard to believe too that either Coetzee or Costello would still be peddling the long-debunked Jews-into-soap line; in fact that she does only serves to make her seem uneducated: so why listen to a lecture by her?The good news is that such a good writer can write average stuff; writers of the world take heart."
3,Rather disappointing,"Elizabeth Costello is an elderly Australian writer who travels all over the world to give and listen to presentations on a variety of subjects ranging from the role of African writing in society to the killing of animals in slaughterhouses. In essence, Elizabeth Costello is an alibi for Coetzee to put together a series of essays with his views on a number of subjects. Even though this may be interesting in itself, I did not like the fact that the book is now in between genres: one the one hand it pretends to be a novel with a fictitious main character, on the other hand it is a bundle of essays. This makes the character development of Elizabeth Costello rather weak, weaker than one may expect from a Nobel Laureate."
1,Ageing AlterEgo rants,"This book was a gift to me, and I was excited by it. Then I started reading. The first chapter was totally engaging and I expected to really enjoy it. Then the rants started. Others have characterized this as philosophizing, but I don't think it deserves such a complimentary description. The book is not a novel, but a collection of lectures by an ageing woman who has apparently lost her writing touch, is intensely worried about her mortality, and frequently in the company of people who suffer from the same problem, and have ""sold out"" to the lecture circuit. Sounds like the author to me. When I pick up a novel, I actually would like to experience good character development and at least a little plot. Philosophy and theology are well discussed in many novels. This isn't one of them."
1,swill if didn't have indigestible chunks,"Coatzee has written some great books. But this probably ranks among the worst book every published by a great writer. Inexcusable to package a bunch of drivelly philosophy as though were part of a novel. And then to pile another, disparate bunch of ditherings from a different errant jag. Still, worse, to yoke it all together without any narrative spine, no characters, no theme, nothing! What an insult! Queremos tanto a Coetzee, if other readers get my drift..."
2,"an overly cerebral, boring mess","I have read some wonderful novels by Coetzee, and so without hesitation I purchased 'Elizabeth Costello'. What a mistake! 'Elizabeth Costello' is really not so much of a novel but rather a forum for the other to pontificate on a whole slew of life and death philosophical matters. Such verbage might be of interest to the top 0.1% of the populace with multiple doctorates and too much time on their hands. For everyone else it's simply the sort of book that screams out ""don't read me!"".Bottom line: maybe better served as fodder for a doctoral thesis?"
1,A rip off,"Is it my imagination but was this author just trying to put every interminible, radical commencement speech he ever heard into bookform and use the most uninteresting character in all of literature to be the speaker. Because it was mercifully short, I read it to the end to see if somehow he let his readers in on this ridiculous joke but alas, it ended how it began. Incredibly boring!!!"
4,The way we write now,"Coetzee has a knack for hard-knock truths about the human conditions. He is both searing, sensitive and forgiving. It makes him the most truly human of writers. This book follows the intelligent, profound forms of his earlier works. Brilliant fiction writing."
2,Misleading as Fiction,"I read J.M. Coetzee's Disgrace and was blown away by its powerful prose. I believe wholeheartedly that J.M. Coetzee is deserving of his Nobel Prize. I started to read Elizabeth Costello and couldn't even finish it because I was so bored. There's no real story to this book. I'm not sure why its classified as a work of fiction. Its not fiction, its a mish-mash of J.M. Coetzee's essays and ideas, collected under the guise of a ""story"". People will buy this book wanting some semblance of a plot or forward moving action and they'll be disappointed, just as I was. I really tried to slog through it all the way to the end (its a slim volume), but I couldn't. Mr. Coetzee is no slouch and he's no dummy ... I'm just not sure this was the right vehicle for getting this type of material out there."
3,Disappointed,"I have been a Coetzee reader for a number of years, and an admirer of his difficult themes and complex characters. I was dusappointed to note that these ""fictions"" were recycled and juxtaposed with different contexts. Still, reading Elizabeth Costello was better than many other books I've come across lately. As far as the perspectives or themes that these ""talks"" tackle...they are only entertaining but not significant enough to stay with this reader."
3,Good but overdramatized,"All the time I kept reading this book I was reminded of ""Disgrace"" and what an awesome book that was! Its not that I hated Costello, but then again somewhere down the line Coetzee's mastery did not come through as it did for Disgrace.Elizabeth Costello is less of a novel more of a manifesto. A manifesto of relationships - seen through an aging writer's eyes-with her son, his wife, the members of her fraternity, with her sister (who she has lost touch and meets only once after eons), with the person she admired as a child, with her mother and with the Almighty (if I may say that).Elizabeth Costello is about many day-to-day questions whose answers we look for in our lives and still are. The book does not provide you with answers, but it does make a great read somewhere down the line. Sublime, funny and sharp - Coetzee is a genius! My bone of contention: I know this one could have been ten thousand times better!!"
1,A Ponderous Read,"Although quite a few paragraphs were poignantly written, I honestly did not get major chunks of this book. The nuanced philosophical discussions & historical references were beyond my level of sophistication."
2,Well written tiresome intellectual exercise,"I found it a labor to navigate through Coetzee intellectual obstacle course. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not entirely bad, well written and some of the topics of her lectures peaked my interest, but many were long and tiresome. I kept waiting for story to lead somewhere but it never happens. If you like a story with a cohesive storyline this isn’t the book for you. The main character reminds me of an old fish flaying on the deck of a ship, gasping its last breath. Hey we all feel like that sometimes in our life, I just don’t enjoy being subjected to it for 230 pages."
3,Brilliant and difficult,"""Elizabeth Costello"" is at turns brilliant and difficult, like much of Coetzee's work. On the one hand, the polemical structure is mesmerizing, if you are not pushed away by its seeming coldness and distance (Coetzee's writing in general is quite icy, and if you are not prepared for it, it can come as a shock, if not off-putting). The discursions about Wolfgang Kohler and Srinivasa Ramanujan are erudite, fascinating, and compelling, and, as always, Coetzee is a sharp, pointed observer of postcolonial and post-imperial relations. On the other hand, the protagonist, a fading, aging female Australian novelist who has a following large enough to allow her to make a living lecturing on college campuses and on cruise ships (meant perhaps to be a shadow of Iris Murdoch or Doris Lessing) is clearly an extension of the author's persona, and is often unconvincing and thinly-drawn as a character."
2,Pedantic and boring (most of the time),"as much as I'd like to be cerebral and enlightened, i must confess that this book bored me. the writing is high-minded and lovely, but the novel's basically formatted as 9 ""lessons,"" or lectures, and after about the 3rd lecture, i lost interest in the preachings. elizabeth costello was interesting when she clashed with other people - her son, her daughter-in-law, other authors - but during most of the book she simply digressed, unchallenged. i'm giving it 2 stars for coetzee's prose, which made me talk and write better while reading this novel."
5,"Nice for display, not much for playing with","I purchased this little fellow in Prague after being given the Dragon for Christmas. It's a remarkably detailed piece, with an amazing level of historical accuracy in the armor and armaments of the 14th/15th century. It's made of highly durable plastic, and overall it's rugged enough to withstand the rigors of entertaining youngsters. I bought several other members of the Schleich Knights series for my two nephews, aged 4 and 6, so there is minimal concern that the detachable parts could be dangerous for young children. The pieces come in two opposing camps: the Red Fleur de Lis, and the Blue Lion, and each piece has a corresponding piece in the other, with somewhat different design and graphics. This reflects an impressive variety in styles of armament and armor of the period, and vastly improves the educational value of the series. This piece is the most bland of the series, and it's ""rival"" piece is uncharacteristicly identical."
5,Favorite songs..,"A lot of my favorites on this CD..buying it primarily for the Terence Boylan song ""Where Are You Hiding"", as it was not included on his recently released CD..now I will have all the songs from his first self-titled album! For more info just stay here on Amazon and click on over! Thanks Amazon!"
2,Disappointed,"I was expecting much more from the HABA brand. These blocks are not ideal for 3-6 year olds at all. The blocks are way too small to be used by those little fingers. This is not an educational toy, its an exercise in frustration. I mean come on-- a block sized 1 inch? We have the Melissa and Doug architectural set and that by far is a better value and quality than these. You can actually recreate some of the designs M & D show on the back of the wooden storage box. Good luck actually trying to make a medieval castle. I would not recommend any of the HABA building blocks for any kid under 6. Its just not a good value."
3,A decent product,"My six year old son loves construction toys and the Mega Bloks ProBuilder Series is one of his favorites. I've been disappointed, however, by how often he notes that ""the Mega Bloks are the ones that don't stick together very well."" Given the fact that we purchased a large number of the kits at closeout sales this isn't a problem, they're not expensive.However, If I consider the amount of time he spends playing with these types of toys (both Lego and Mega Bloks), the pleasure he gets from them, and the the educational value, then I can easily justify the additional cost of Legos.Bottom line: Mega Bloks are okay, but the Legos are a much better value."
4,huge model for a small price,"The aircraft carrier is a really nice model. My favorite thing about it is its size. It is huge! What I also like is its small price. Compared to models from LEGO, this one is much more affordable. Overall it is a great buy."
2,"Too much ""instrument"", not enough ""voice""","I was drawn to buy my first Diamond Rio CD by their incredibly tight, incredibly beautiful vocal harmony. This CD is really disappointing. The album is terribly over-orchestrated. So much so that the group really looses showcasing their vocals. I wish they would just do a freakin' ""accapella"" CD!!! This CD is just to ""quirky"" for me. I think they need to just pick a flavor & stick with it. They need some new, fresh writers, producers & managers. They've really cashed in on their ballads. I don't know why they try so hard to go away from that. They're really going to loose it if they don't hone in on what they do best...accenting their ""vocals"" & choosing great material."
3,Instrumentals and Vocals Shine On This One,"As we've come to expect, Diamond Rio delievers some tight harmonies and amazing instrumentals on their latest album, ""Completely."" I think they would have been better served to find some better material to sing and play. ""Beautiful Mess"" is definitely the pinnacle of this CD, while ""I Believe"" is a decent yearning ballad. The rest of the songs seem to be more filler than anything. The band's harmonies can make up for some of it, but if you want a great Diamond Rio CD I would reccomend ""IV"" or ""Greatest Hits."""
2,"Too much ""instrument"", not enough ""voice""","I was drawn to buy my first Diamond Rio CD by their incredibly tight, incredibly beautiful vocal harmony. This CD is really disappointing.

3,Disappointed,"After the musical standard set by Unbelievable & One More Day, my expectations were, I guess, unreasonable. Once you get past Beautiful Mess (the reason it gets 3 stars instead of 2), this album lacks both the lyrical edge, emotion, and musical magic that I associate with that unique, complex Diamond Rio sound. Something's missing. It's almost as if they rushed to get another album out before they had the material to meet their previous standards. I still consider Diamond Rio one of the two most underated groups in country music (the ill-fated Restless Heart is the other one), but this CD won't get near the play time from me as their previous 2 efforts."
5,"""I Believe"" is what it's all about","I had put off purchasing Diamond Rio's latest CD...it just hadn't been a priority for me. I changed my tune, so to speak, when I heard ""I Believe"" for the first time on the radio. This song is more than worth the purchase price of the CD. Unlike others who have critiqued this CD, I haven't yet lost a loved one, but can only imagine the comfort this song will bring with its tender message of eternal love. This song still causes my eyes to tear and goosebumps on my skin. And besides this song, the rest of the CD is fantastic. Diamond Rio isn't the latest thing out of Nashville, but they are proving why they are still around and why the remain one of the best groups around. They are at the top of their game with this CD. The vocals, harmonies and instrumentals blend flawlessly. Bravo, Diamond Rio! And thank you for an enjoyable listening experience."
2,So Disappointing!!!,"I was soooo looking for a COMPLETE album of Diamond Rio songs, but instead I only got ONE-Beautiful Mess. And that kind of describes this album. One beautiful song and the rest is a mess.I agree with others that outside of one song, they seemed to have made up an entire ablum on the spot with no care to put the Diamond Rio harmony signature on the it. I would not recommend this album to anyone. The two stars is for being able to play the first song over and over."
1,Not what I expected,"This might be the least favorite cookbook I ever bought on Amazon. First off, the recipes were not listed in any kind of table of contents, so it was difficult to find the various items.The Chicken Devine was extremely dry. My cat wouldn't even eat it.In the future, I might suggest sticking to more conventional areas of cooking like BBQ or Wok.No wonder the guns were angry."
2,Should of said IRREGULAR,"Shirt quality was fine, thick cotton, but the hem on the front of the shirt was shorter than the back of the shirt, somebody didnt have their V8 that day."
2,Fun - Certainly not 5 Stars,"Please people, this book is quite and mildly amusing, but 5 stars? Please... It was OK, semi funny, but 'Mimi' is too weird in order to be able to relate to, and the little quips get a dull after a while. I finished this a couple of weeks ago and would be hard-pressed to remember any of it."
1,Just pathetic,"I picked us this book, knowing full well it was not going to be earth shattering and present new outlooks on life or love. I was expecting something more on the lines of ""Bridget Jones;"" something witty with a story that is easy to read with a glass of white on the deck enjoying the summer breeze. When you read the description on the back of the book it declares: ""Get ready world - because Mimi's going to explain it all to you!"" I'm not sure what happened here, as nothing was explained merely commented on in that annoying judgmental attempt at sounding witty. I, like the author, am unable to put down a book, even if it is miserably horrible. If you value your reading time, please do not pick up this book."
3,Better off getting CD 1 and 2 of the UK release,"Hit and miss this one is for me. This single semi combines the 2 UK singles into one cd, however it is missing is the wonderful mondo grosso mix of Love Foolosophy and you also miss out of the live song Titan (which is no real loss).As for the songs here, the tracklist is wrong (the 2 remixes are for the song Mein Vein). These 2 remixes are terrific and worth buying the single for alone.Bad Girls is a fairly terrible song, it is a live song with Anastasia and is not Jamiroquai at all, for me hearing this song really hit home for me that the old Jamiroquai was long gone. :("
3,A Little disappointing,I was hoping for more in the way of actual picture critiques. I would have liked to have seen an depiction of a recognizable old master and be walked through the symbiology of it.
5,Very nice,The book came to me very promptly and in wonderful condition. I ordered 6 books and this book arrived first. I would do business with this person again.
4,Great quality of a great TV Western Series,"Watching this series of episodes from Gunsmoke, brought back many memories of growing up, sitting in front of our black and white (SD)television in the late 1950s every Saturday night at 9 pm. The quality of the DVDs is very good. This makes reliving the conflicts in Dodge as real as it did sixty years ago. This is a real treat of nostalgia TV."
3,general overview,"I was very glad to see Gumsmoke come to dvd. However I cannot give this set more than three stars! Why? Its not because these episodes are bad or that Gunsmoke is a so,so T.V. show. Quite the contrary. The reason why I only rate it three stars is there simply are not enough episodes of this fine show to satisfy me. I beleive it would have been better for Paramount Studios/CBS to have released seasonal sets instead of ""Collectors Editons"" or ""Directors Collections"" . If or when they do release seasonal sets, Then I will give it five stars!"
3,"Okay, but Lacking Verve","This Shakespearean anthology is not bad; at the same time, it's hardly the best that's out there. My principal quibble with this release is that for most of its program it lacks energy, a deficiency which is not really made up for by a greater degree of elegance. Many of these tunes have been rendered in much more appealing manners by the likes of the Baltimore Consort, Jordi Savall and company, or the Broadside band, among others. More than a few are played largely from the harpsichord -- again, no great sin in itself, but for keyboard performances of Elizabethan music one can do so much better with, say, Sophie Yates, who in her performances puts a bit a backbone and verve into the music. Again, I'm not saying this is a bad album, just that one can do far better with other choices."
5,Amrthyst Ring,"I found this ring to be great! It is just like the picture (though a little smaller as the picture states ""larger than actual""). I like the picture on the site which shows you haw the ring looks on your finger. It is better than I expected! Thanx"
2,not what it looks like,I just bought one and thought that it would be as sophisticated as the one in the picture. It actually looks more like the shiny coated plastic toy rings that I buy in the dollar store for my daughter. The finish is not well crafted and is actually clumsily done upon closer inspection. Not worth the price.Doesn't seem to be real silver either.
2,"Somewhat entertaining graphically, but so what.","Apocalyptic setting, female android hero, mech-armor, cold characters, this must be another Japanese's anime and it is. The only thing that kept me watching this movie was the awesome graphic. It was like watching 3D animated cells rendering. Ghost in the Shell's best is second to the technical visual of this film. Sadly, the plot and storyline was not as innovation or spectacular at all. It felt like watching an average Hollywood's film that regurgitated other themes, plots and ideas from other movies and reused it. Like another reviewer noted, the character and facial expression felt like ""Reboot,"" which was first generation computer animation in the US.Simply stated below average directing, story-writing, but even with top notch animation still makes this hard to recommend to the average viewer."
3,Good enough,"Sat down to watch this the same weekend that I watched the TBS film Vexille. It had a futuristic city of steel and glass, flying cars, and mechs. Really... what's not to like, right ? Well, the animation was kind of flat. And while the story of humans and clones living in harmony had its peaks - it also had its valleys. The heroine is both touching and exciting. But the story would go off the rails for me and I'd have to sit through several minutes of exposition before I found myself dragged back into the action.I've certainly seen worse sci-fi tales. That said, if I had my choice, I'd sooner watchVexille - Movieagain."
3,good but like a video game,"The storyline was great, but the animation is like a video game type quality. The CG is somewhat primitive it's not at all like Pixar (Toy Story) or Dreamworks (Shrek). It's like Gungrave (PS2) type quality but it you get used to it. I think the storyline and CG is a lot better in the 2nd movie: Appleseed ExMachina. If you only see 1 Appleseed movie, get the ExMachina one. I wish Netflix had this 1st DVD to rent so I wouldn't have to buy it. It's ok, but if I saw it first, I wouldn't have chosen to buy it. That said, I'll be listing mine for auction soon."
2,Yet another cliche anime movie,"Appleseed suffers from the problem most big budget, CGI enhanced anime theatrical releases have: Gorgeous visuals, but a incomprehensible story filled with dull cliche dialog. Trust me, I was sucked in by the amazing trailer like most of you. I wanted this to be a great movie (as I am a fan of the OAV animated series). Appleseed is worth seeing for the visuals alone... but that is about all."
3,"All Action, No Story","By the end there just wasn't enough to keep me entertained and I found myself growing bored with it very quickly. The break neck action and interesting concepts were fun at first but by the end, I really felt like I needed more and this feature wasn't going to provide it. If you were a fan of the manga, you'll probably be a fan of this feature as well but otherwise this is really just a release for people who are looking for some decent mech action without much story to bog you down."
5,Good Movie,Appleseed was a beautiful movie. I feel like I am missing a part of this anime but this movie was great. I recommend it.
3,...Disapointing....,"I wanted so very much for Appleseed to blow me away - and it nearly did. Unfortunately, whenever I would come close to truly being wrapped up in the movie, the stiff Barbie-doll like appearance and mannerisms of the ""human"" characters would snap me back to reality in a heartbeat; in all seriousness, they reminded me of the horrible 'Barbie: Rapunzel' dvd someone gifted one of my children with. Anime is never terribly realistic in proportion, it is true, but in this case the stark contrast between what otherwise appeared to be traditional animation(although it was not) and the ""human"" subjects was jarring enough to be too much of a distraction to ever really fully enjoy the movie."
5,Killer Anime Action,"This one is amazing. Looks breathtaking, great sound and music. great characters and story, and packed with action.Adults looking for good full length Anime with no kiddy factor? you found it, and none look better, except Final Fantasy the Spirits within, but this one doesn't go way over the top and lose you in the story."
3,balderdash,"What great animation!And that's about all that was good about this movie. The plot is predictable and uninteresting, the characters undevloped, and the voice actors are sub par. The film starts off strongly and with a lot of promise, after the initial sequence, you already know how the movie will end. When a film group spends this much money on a film, you'd think they'd bother to get a plot to go along with it, but that certainly wasn't the case with Applecrap. What a shame."
4,Appleseed,"Appleseed is one of the movies in my collections I watch at lest once a month for its viewing pleassure, so should you!!!!!"
5,The Future look of Animae is Awesome!!,"Just bought this DVD at Megacon, and was blown away within 2 seconds of this beautifully made film.Appleseed is a 3-D, fully animated CGI film that is awesome in all aspects, from design and storyline, to awesome battle sequences, this one is top-of-the-line. If only they made them all this all around good!A classic in many areas."
3,Okay movie but starts off to slow,"This movie was okay. The animation was good,but nothing spectacular, the movie starts off way to slow and you don't really know whats going on until about the middle part of the movie. After that the movie starts to pick up. I give it a B- in my book."
5,I love it,I really loved the movie. The graphics were amazing and I liked the plot better than the original cel animation version of it.
4,Expedient but a little underpackaged,The product arrived very promptly but could easily have fallen out of the flimsy plastic bag with a big hole in it.
4,"Olive Lovers, Take Note!","These are huge, delicious, pricey green olives. They contain the pit so stay fresh and tasty for a long time. Others might not like that, however, being used to the pitted variety. The only problem is that they are packed in a heavy plastic bag but once you cut it to eat your first olives, you need to find a LARGE container to store the rest of the olives and brine. And, space in the fridge to hold the large container. A small price to pay, however, for these delicious beauties. I'll order again."
3,Use Caution Before Purchasing***,"There is no doubt that the MEMORIES Collection is a great budget source for classic tunes from the Best of The Best. However, heed caution before purchasing. This is one of the Biggest headaches in trying to get the correct title.Samba Entertainment used the Same UPC [5028464000041] for most of the catalog, so you can actually receive any title. Anything from Bing Crosby, Al Jolson, Duke Ellington, etc... Before ordering from any Marketplace vendor, be sure to inquire the actual title they are offering as many vendors list there inventories by UPC only. This way you are not disappointed that you received the wrong title and it will prevent an unfaulted headache to the marketplace seller.There is no blame to the seller, only the label. Regardless of the labels farst, they do offer a great product for a budget price. Collect them all... and enjoy!"
3,Nilsson saves the day,"This is one of those ""should have been"" recordings that manages to provide quite a wallop. Legend has it that Callas was supposed to record Minnie (although she never sang the role on stage). The part is a famous voice-killer, as Leontyne Price learned when she briefly undertook it in 1965, precipitating a vocal crisis. Corelli, a famous Dick Johnson, was to partner Callas, and Tito Gobbi, a reknowned Jack Rance, was also signed. Alas, Callas concelled, Corelli pulled the plug, Gobbi thought he saw the handwriting on the wall--and EMI scarmbled to get Nilsson. She's pretty thrilling as Minnie--she's pretty thrilling as anything she ever sang--and the rest of the cast isn't half bad. But, oh, what might have been..."
5,Great Resource for eBay Sellers,"This book is the best guide for online auction sellers out there, and I've seen most of them. Many authors seem afraid to mention independent sites & services, but Nancy points out some terrific resources for sellers. Her screen shots of Web sites make it visually appealing. You can really tell this book was written by someone who sells herself, there are lots of ""insiders"" tips and tricks. My only complaint: that the publisher has not updated the book since it first came out - some of the services have closed up shop, and eBay Stores are not covered."
5,Amazing show,"this show was amazing, it was very dark but it had its comic relief spread around in it; or else it would be unbearably sad and dark, sort of like how they made star wars have funny droids to compensate for anikan murdering children and the jedi being murdered by old allies.if you like vampires get this show for sure"
5,Shiki stands at the top of the horror anime genre.,"Shiki, aka Vampires, are taking over a village in the mountains. The village is cut off from civilization, and a bit behind the times. A family called the Kirishiki's move into town. At the same time the village experiences a long series of deaths. Only a few residents actually start to catch on to the fact that the Kirishiki's are behind it. This anime has everything beautiful art, amazing soundtrack, likable characters, and a very engrossing story. I don't want to say too much in fear of spoiling the fun, but I will say that Shiki stands at the top of the horror anime genre. Definitely check it out."
2,Misleading title,"I couldn't agree more with Jarmo.I would rename this book: ""Things that may happen to you while running Microsoft Windows and certain applications on a networked environment""Subtitle: ""(not a Networking book)"""
1,Why I won't buy this book,"I've got to this book at Amazon from a sponsored link in a newsletter for IT professionals.Amazon's ""Look inside"" feature is great - convinced me not to consider this book. Even the first network diagram shows IP addresses with five bytes (192.168.2.2.2) and network masks like 55.255.255.0. One can say it's a type, but again, the next diagram shows the same errors.I don't believe this is a book for pros."
2,Graphics in book too small,"The book is ok. The pictures which are supposed to show the moves are too small, difficult for those of us who are opticallychallenged. The game system is explained as are the characters. My main complaint is the size of the pictures"
4,Great for Panini's,"Very pleased with the GR-2 Griddler, but the grease cup not being attached to the grill was annoying as it often did not stay in place.Non-stick surface worked fine and was easy to clean."
5,Panini Perfect,"I have not cooked anything but Paninis with my GR-2, but every time I've used it, the results have been perfect. The non-removable plates might not clean up as fast as the removable plates in other brands, but I promise you that you'll love the perfect, even heat these plates provide. I would buy this same item again, no doubt! The sandwiches I make with this unit always come out deliciously browned and very tasty."
5,Great Product,"I love this product. I wanted something different from a George Foreman, and I found it."
3,a few drawbacks,"I wasn't paying attention when I bought my grill, and read ""non-removable"" as ""removable"" when i glanced at the description. Being able to take off the plates would make all the difference. Cleanup is difficult. When cleaning the top plate, unless you hold onto it as you clean, pulling it forward a bit, there's dripping onto the back of the grill and counter (you can't just let it rest in place). Another small quibble is I can't see the indicator lights when the grill is closed unless I stoop down or lean in over it, and I'm average height. On the plus side, it heats up quickly and evenly, and it's nice to have three heat settings."
4,Superb product,"Most Cuisinart products are grossly overpriced. Their 100.00 coffee brewers are a joke, bar none. I recently purchased this griddler from Amazon. I am 99.44% pleased with it. A grilled steak is superb. It is a bit difficult to clean. I wish it had removeable plates and I wish it had a timer as well as the thermostat. I don't understand why a company can't put the features people want in a product. Would I buy it again -- perhaps overpriced -- but YES. A good product."
2,cheap,"feels cheap. hard plastic ball, heavy when kicked. does not come inflated. although it's the cheapest ball out there, i regret buying it, but not worth the trouble returning, so bought another ball that i'm very happy to play with my toddlers."
3,It was ok,I was surprised when I received it and it was deflated. I didn't have the needle or anyway to inflate it and it was a gift for someone. So I was a little disappointed. However my father had the equipment and was able to inflate it so everything worked out.
4,nice little camera,"fits perfectely on every notebook, and has nice funny piece of software, that comes with it."
3,"OK for XP, NOT Vista, Marginal Picture Quality","There are much better available, avoid this ""Creative Webcam"" unless you are getting it cheap and are only installing it on an XP PC. It does not work on Vista.It did install fairly quickly on my XP PCs (we have 3 of these webcams) and performs well enough for video chatting. The picture quality is just OK, nothing special. The included software is also OK and does what you expect it to do.Not recommended."
5,SET LIST GREAT DVD,"LIVING IN THE CITY, SOILDER MAN A COMECLEAN OUT THE BAD, WHO'S THE BESTJUST CAN'T STOP, STREET LIFEGIRL TELL ME, ZION TRAIN,LAZER BEAM, HOLIDAYPLUS 3 MORE FROM AT SOHO S.B. 2009"
4,Great,It is perfect for the mornings !!!!!!!!!It is soft and remainded me of a far away places.Great to spray it all day long.
2,Perfect if it fits.,"I have owned LUND products before, so I was sure this was going to be a good bargain. Unfortunately, even after stating my vehicle make, model and year,it still didn't fit. Not even close. Nice product though."
5,Great Storytelling,"Driven was an impossible act to follow and W. G. Griffiths has done the impossible. I loved the diologue, especially between Gavin and Grella. Amy was in a new role after marraige and pregnancy evolved her character but the suspence and conflict never let up. Fast paced, as usual with Griffiths' books, and plenty of twists to the plot. Very imaginative. Highly recommendable. As with DRIVEN, looking forward to the next one."
5,Excellent Sequel,Driven was great and so is Takedown. Captivating plot and diologue. I especially enjoyed the character evolution from one book to the next. Unable to put it down and read through it in two days. Looking forward to the next book.
2,A cliffhanger that never makes it to the cliff,"I was very impressed with Driven, and I anxiously got Takedown, with high hopes. While this book was fairly good, it just lacked depth. The plot was somewhat predictable, there was no cliffhanger type moment, the character development was weak, and the ending was flat.I was disappointed, to say the least.This book didn't take long to read at all, it is very simply written and does not have much substance. It's not bad; I've read worse, but it could have been much better.I doubt I will remember anything about this book in two weeks."
5,This movie inspired me,"This movie is full of airs and everything good about surfing. I have done an air once and used my friends' new school board to get the longest barrel of my life, so I only begin to grasp the rightness of when I first saw this movie. I wish I could get the soundtrack to it."
5,Absolutely delightful music making! Add to your collection,"Don Bailey has released a CD that showcases a number of lesser-known flute jewels, and the flute world should be grateful to him for it. These pieces are beautiful, and the musicians offer lovely and convincing interpretations. The recording quality is superb, the energy level high, and the flute playing extraordinary. Add this CD to your collection, because it's one you'll listen to again and again."
4,"""Peace of Mind""","This is a beautifully done compilation of various native artists that is in the genre of ""easy listening"". The songs in native tongue are soothing, uncomplicated and restorative. I found my worries disappear as I listened to it. The outstanding piece on this one for me was ""Mother Earth"" by Joanne Shenendoah. I would have bought the tape for this one alone. The words of truth and lovely melody with her pristine voice is amazingly beautiful. Priemaux and Mike are also among my favorites. High recomendation!"
5,"It put me in touch with the people, Spotted Horse.",The songs really blew me away with all of the humanly possible one can ever imagine. These songs touched me in a spiritual way. I highly recommend this style of music for its innovativeness.
3,Good but not great,"Some works on this Cd are very good, but others aren't. A bit monotonous. So, overall it's not bad. It's just okay."
3,title of review,Another album of blah Elliott Smithy acoustic ballads from the former singer-guitarist of the great 90s emo/indie rock band M.I.J.. I hope he gets sick of wasting his talent on this stuff soon and picks up his electric guitar again.
5,Inspiring and thoughtful,Helps me think about my faith and how I show it in thought and deed. It also helps me see when I don't use my faith. Beth Moore is very inspirational in her Love of the Word and God!
5,Apparently I really like this book.,I really enjoy Beth Moores teaching to begin with but I had bought this book a few years back and loaned it out. Forgetting I had done this I bought it for a second time and I enjoy more now than then.
1,very disappointed,"the sound on this CD is as tinny as it would be on old 78's. instead of re-sounding the lovely romberg melodies or, better yet, just re-recording them, this is ""original"", dated, and to my mind, very disappointing. it may be interesting to anyone who cares about historical records, but not to me. i probably should have paid more attention to the description given of the CD, but i did not. too bad."
5,Great Book!,"This is a terrific book! I've just started working my way through it and I'm impressed. I've used other methods before, but this one seems workable."
5,Good choice,"After a good research this title came up and since my expectations are quite high I wasn't sure if I made the right choice to buy this book.Now I am wrapped! With my knowledge about altering and/or creating sewing patterns not quite reaching the level I was after, this book will be a great help for me.The illustrations and text are very easy for me to understand and the price is a bonus.I made the right decision to buy this title."
5,For those serious about learning patternmaking,"Okay, it isn't filled with beautiful color photos, but if you really want to learn to draft patterns from scratch for yourself or someone else, this is an excellent book, and MUCH less expensive than textbooks with similar information. The author has an e-group (referenced in the book) where you can get help from him and other from other students as you go through the process. The book takes you step-by-step from measuring yourself (this alone is worth the price of the book) or someone else through drafting the basic blocks, designing the darts with a sort of draping technique, transferring darts to the block, and fine-tuning the fit through the second fitting. Then it goes on to teach you how to manipulate the basic blocks to design any garment you can imagine."
2,Warning to those alone and sewing for themselves!,"Although this book tells you how to measure yourself, be aware that it relies upon old-fashion, two-person fitting methods to go from a basically rectangular pattern piece to a useable pattern, rendering it useless if you are sewing exclusively for yourself and have no on-site frequent help available. I tried using the measurements to adapt this method but then I was all on my own. Also, the instructions about how to go from ""smoothing out excess"" in the initial fitting to actually placing and making the darts is sketchy in the extreme. Again, I was on my own there. There's lots of good information in this book but don't think it'll allow you to stop buying patterns to start from. After making two ""muslins"" for the ""basic skirt"". I gave up and went back to adjusting a commercial pattern. Way too much ridiculous effort for a simple skirt!"
4,Everything you need to get started making patterns,"This book gives a beginner all of the information they need in order to draft a pattern based on any person's form so that they can then continue on and alter the pattern to any style they choose. The only complaint that I have is that is a bit outdated, although the instructions are still perfect for the task."
4,Fool-proof pattern making!,"Donald McCunn's ""How to Make Sewing Patterns"" is a terrific, comprehensive text for those who want to understand how patterns work, and how to make them. I read it from cover to cover, and can't wait to get to work on a project, and to teach my daughter to make patterns for her designs. One word of advice to users: all measurements are in inches. If you were brought up on the metric system, get yourself a tapemeasure with both imperial and metric measurements before you start. Better still, could the author bring out a new edition with metric measurements in brackets?"
4,Great pattern making book for beginners!,"I love this book! I have never taken a pattern making class before and I just learned to sew a year ago. So you do not need to be experienced with sewing or pattern making to be able to use this book. I was able to make a slopper pattern based on my own measurements, then the book teaches you how to edit the basic pattern into a new design. This book is great! The only thing I do not like about the book is that it does not teach you how to draft a sleeveless bodice. Other than that, this book is great for beginners because it is so easy to follow and really explains what you are doing. I highly recommend this book!"
5,The Best Drafting Book,At first when I opened the book I was disappointed that the pictures were in black and white and that the drawings were hand sketches. But as I began to read through the book I just couldn't put it down. I found this publication to be very informative and easy to learn. The techniques employed are simple to master. The layout of the book should be revised for an easier flow of reading but the context was of great value. A must add to any sewer's library.
4,generally pleased,"""I am just learning how to make and sew my own patterns. I feel this book does a really great job at explaining and demonstrating through text and illustrations what is to be done. The only thing that I would like to see in this book would be how the actual construction of the patterns into garments is done. For example where do you start to sew on the pattern, what kind of stitch to use where, etc. Other than that the book will be an excellent reference for measuring, and pattern making."
3,Not enough info;,This Book does NOT have enough information for making your own patterns.I am disappointed... nothing like I thought it would be.
2,Sparce and Murky,"I bought this book with excitement, and got some aid in patternmaking. But it's nothing to write home about. I never, ever made a pattern before, and this book didn't help very much. While it has a moderate amount of patterns, they are all variations of one another and the diagrams are very, very sparce. They illustrate the ""basic"" pattern and show you how to spread it out to make a ""new"" pattern. It isn't very clear, especially to someone who has no training in design whatsoever. It also lacks a lot of description and uses otherwise unfamiliar terms with candor. The author assumes a lot about the reader.I would recommend a more extensive book, or take a course at a college."
3,Half good,The forward drive and passenger side shades are great and have not given any issues. The ones for the rear windows would stick out enough that the windows wouldn't roll all the way up. I ended up taking the back ones out.
3,Looks good but rear windows get caught,"I really wanted the in-channel window vents because I think it looks better. Although I am happy with how they look, the rear two vents don't work great. I installed them all according to the directions, but the rear windows get caught on the vents when they are getting rolled up. I haven't come up with a solution yet, but it seems there need to be more adhesive on the corners of the vents so they don't pull inwards when the windows go down. The front vents work great and I use those two windows the most anyway, but it is annoying that I have to come up with a solution for a product that should fit seamlessly. It does keep the rain out and provides me with fresh air, so it's not all bad."
3,Camphor mask,I believe the combination of chemicals used would make quite a satisfactory face mask. It appears like it would not only benefit the skin but also the sinuses and nasal passages with the camphor vapors. Would like to try the product and see how it really feels. Thank you for this chance.
4,This one stays with you,"The extraordinary aspect of this book is that something so intrinsic in the potential of man and girl has taken so long to be articulated in an honest, apolitical and non-judgmental way. GIRLS talks about more than the inexorable moral slide of today's corporate man. Kelman is not anti-capitalist, nor is he claiming material success today leaves the powerful and those they attract in a greater spiritual void than it once did: as his parallel narrative reminds us, the Greeks had their Gods and their Furies and yet they were fighting for 14 year old girls with their lives. This is about intelligent men losing the battle with their instincts, about the fragility of status and about the searing, frightening truth that moments are what men live for. Whatever it takes."
2,Loses Itself in an Attempt at Rehab,"Kelman has it going for him throughout this novel which I am actually giving 2 1/2 stars. However, his use of mythological references seems a sad attempt to give this work some gravitas that the writer thinks the front story is unworthy of. The tale is as old as the hills: this is what men are. Tell it straight, and don't try to back it up with mythology and you've got a real winner. The constant interruptions from the Iliad and the Odyssey show the writer's insecurities, in my opinion, and stunt this book's arc."
5,Great Listening,This cd is perfect for all Christians who just love to sing and praise the Lord at all times! I can sit and relax to this song or me and my friends can play this cd and just have a party! I've gone to plenty of Pool Boys concerts and boy oh boy do they know what they're doing! GO POOL BOYS
4,Interesting.,"Convergent Series is diffinenty a thinking man's book. Sheffield writes an amazing trip through the mind, and creates a new level for human thought to expand into."
3,adequate,"This piece is adequate. For me, at least, it doesn't heat up as quickly as advertised. Also not much pressure but that is to be expected. It will serve its purpose though."
3,better then bag type water warmers but valves leak slow all 3,"These are by far superior to the bag type water warmers, much tougher and last way longer. I call them ""water warmers"" because I made my own shower and only use these to warm the water with, weather permitting, otherwise I additionaly heat to a prefered temperature. my gf is picky. I tested and found the water is actually a few degrees warmer with these containers than the other type of solar shower. Do not store these in your vehicle full of water! Fill them once at camp and you'll be fine. It takes about 6 hours of direct sunlight to raise the water temp by approximatly 20 degrees above ambient temperature. They claim less but don't buy that unless your in the 80's or 90's. A cool winter day with less day light about 15 degrees more than ambient temp. I gave this product only 3 stars because they all leak and I would pay a few bucks more for something that didn't."
4,Nothing fancy but does the trick.,"I could not fill it to capacity and then hoist it up into the tree I was using, but then again i am not the stongest girl in the world, and was trying to do it alone. Once I emptied out some of the water, it was easier to lift. Not perfect, but effective."
1,Horrible sun shower,"The solar shower plastic material felt very thin and stiff right out of the box. I decided to fill it up for prior to leaving for a week long camping trip and found that it had two 1/2"" holes! The holes seemed to have occured along lines where the bag had been folded in the box. I did not get to use it once. The material felt very cheap and did not seem durable, but I would have expected to get a at least a year of use out of it.I would definitely not recommend this product."
3,Solar shower,"We go through at least one of these showers each year (the sides tend to split open), but they are still a great option when running water is not available. Plus it is easy to hang the shower from a tree, and the spray nozzle works well. I am not thrilled, however, to have to pay $6.00 for shipping, when I can go to a different site and pay nothing."
1,Leaked,"I set this back as soon as I got it. I filled it with water and it leaked from a small hole. The unit was folded tight to fit in the box and were it was folded it leaked. Real cheap price, I guess you get what you pay for."
1,dont get it,I thought this would be more sturdy than the bag type solar showers as well. Mine came with a small leak in the crease right out of the box and soon developed leaks through the seams an any crease it had. It didn't even last a week camping in yosemite. I was bummed out but now I am going to just make my own.
1,A Poor Camera From a Poor Company,"The camera I bought failed after just 2 months. Now, 8 months later, Konica have all but disowned the problem after I had paid US$96 for repair and I still don't have my camera back!Terrible service! Terrible camera!"
3,The camera is value for money,The camera is a good buy. Do not expect much out of it but I must say that it gives you value for money.
4,side streets,"Strangers in town is OK,but Side Streets is excellant,as always Aline MacMahon carrys the movie.She plays a strong business women.She is one of the most under rated Actresses of all time.I only wish there were more available."
5,INDIAN ART AT YOUR FINGERTIPS!,"A fantasic reference for the discerning collector of Indian Artifacts!! Names, Histories, Hallmarks, just about anything you can want to know! A MUST FOR THE SERIOUS COLLECTOR!"
3,"Its OK, Depending on How You Use It","I bought this to light up the pantry located behind/beneath the stairs. The motion sensing feature works fine. However, the lighting feature doesn't get close to lighting up the pantry, but since I didn't mount it to the wall, I just pick it up and use it as a flashlight. When I'm done, put it down, and close the door. It turns off by itself. Its more of an oversized nightlight, but considering the cost, its a fair product."
1,Wasn't a good choice,"I bought this to light a hallway and found the light was very adequate. The light pattern and mounting position make this suitable only for wall hanging (not ceiling).Initial testing was great and it worked as it should, until it didn't. It would turn itself on and off erratically during the night. The on and off was without any apparent reason.I trashed (recycled) it. Not worth the postage to return.I also bought a ""SE Wireless Motion Sensor Light - 10 Super-Bright LED"" to use in a dark closet and found it to be a better choice for either ceiling or wall application."
4,Maxxima 3 LED Occupancy Sensor Light,"I use it in my stairwell/hall. It has all the features I wanted (turns on only when it is dark and only when someone is in the area). The illumination is good--not too bright for sleepy night eyes, not too dim so it is actually helpful.You really need to use ""precharged""-type rechargeable batteries, or you're causing too much waste--terrible. Try Sony Eneloops--they are GREAT. I use them for everything, especially my camera. I find for this light, I have to recharge them about every 3-6 months--but this is a stairwell/hallway that we walk through a LOT at night, so I think that's pretty good.I do wish the motion sensor had a wider ""peripheral vision"" (both horizontal and vertical) so i took off a star, but it will do, and I doubt anything better is actually available. The price was right, too."
3,Bright Light - Sensor a bit erratic,The 3 LEDs throw off quite a bright light - good enough for an entry hall in our house. The light is a whiter light - not the bluish light you often get with LEDs.Only issue is that the sensor is a little erratic. Sometimes it doesn't work and other times it works quickly and other times it works slowly.
4,Battery power for odd nook,"Fills the bill well for a poorly lit stretch of stairs. It worked erratically with nearly-drained lithium photo AA batteries, but highly satisfactory with standard alkaline. I don't like using disposable batteries, so I hope it will work with rechargables. The sensor functions work well for my purposes. I put it against the wall at the top step or on a windowsill above the upper steps."
1,Money is Where You Find It,"The story of the wealthy Getty family is told in ""Painfully Rich."" If you're thinking of reading this book to learn how to get rich like tycoon J. Paul Getty, forget it. The family fortune was largely due to luck.J. Paul Getty was the patriarch of a dysfunctional family because of his bizarre attitudes toward marriage. He repeatedly married nymphets and then he deserted them when they became pregnant.J. Paul negotiated for Middle Eastern drilling rights on property that he had never visited. He ended up fabulously wealthy, but could have just as easily drawn a blank. His father had already gotten rich from Oklahoma oil, and J. Paul himself was already a millionaire due to the Oklahoma operation before he ventured into the Middle East.The book omits the explanation of why the sale of Getty Oil to Texaco resulted in a $10 billion judgment for Penzoil."
5,Best stuff I have ever bought,This stuff is amazing for the do it yourselfer. I have fixed so much broken plastic that it has paid for itself. If you have kids you be a hero fixing plastic Chinese crap toys. If you break tabs on ur cheap plastic interior this kit is perfect. This product is the best product I've bought in years.
4,works!,It is a rip off that you have to endure because that is how Ford designed the damn engine. In my opinion avoid that engine if you can!
1,Defective Kit,"This kit was completely useless! The stabilizing bracket for the back of the camshaft broke at the weld during installation. It added an extra 2 days of repair because of the timing issues that resulted from the defective kit! Very frustrating and upsetting, especially when you consider the extra shipping fees I paid because I needed it so quickly."
4,good and effective,Used this tool on a ford explorer which we replace a head gasket set on it was indispensable to removing the cam bolt on the front right side at the fire wall side it is a set which is well designed and constructed a must have for any one attempting this repair
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY,I'VE READED HALF THE BOOK AND SO FAR A WASTE OFF TIME AND MONEY. ALL I'VE LEARNED IS THE HISTORY OF SLOTS. I WAS NOT LOOKING FOR THIS INFORMATION. AND 50 PLUS PAGES OF INFORMATION THAT IS TAKEN OFF THE FRONT OF THE SLOT MACHINE.
1,Look elsewhere...,"The ""powerful profits"" are made to the author when you buy this book. This book will not help you in any way, unless you have never been to a casino in your life."
1,"""Eh, Paisano"" Not Recommended","This is a thrown together mish mash of pop 50's tunes. They are not even all Italian-Americans. There are much better recordings available, with higher artistic standards. I would recommend getting single artists like: Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennet, Dean Martin or Perry Como."
1,Very disappointed,"I hated this CD. What a waste of my money plus shipping, handling and tax! Some of the songs are really stupid, such as ""Pepino, the Italian Mouse."" Maybe you have to be Italian! I got the soundtrack from the movie, Moonstruck, at the same time, and I like it."
5,all the fun of being an Italo-American in one package,"first heard this in an italian restaurant and searched for six months before finally turning to amazon.com. it's livelier than ""mob hits"" because each song is about the fun connected with being Italian. Monte and Prima are childhood heros and can't be beat."
5,A thievery favourite,"I've got most of their albums, but Cosmic Game is a must-have for those wanting to get a handle on the chillout crew"
2,The dullest record in Babylon,"I really wonder what most of the reviewers listen to actually.This is a really dull album without any of the creativity and appeal of ""The mirror conspiracy"". The following ""The richest man in Babylon"" was a step back with the same use of chords and beats but this is too much! Reggaeish stuff mostly. Except the track with David Byrne that sounds fresh despite being very typical (Once in a liftime style) the rest is absolutely dull and good only for joint smokers. Which probably is what most of the enthusiastic reviewers are...LOLAnyway still respect to the two guys for their past but next time please try something new"
3,Same old,"I keep buying CDs from these two guys due to inertia, I think: their music is just barely good enough to keep me coming back. This CD is not a departure from their previous work, all they've added are a few breakbeats and some vocals. 6 or 7 years ago these guys were fresh and different. Today, well, this CD is being relegated to background music, I'm afraid."
4,"Yes, it is a Great edidtion to familiarize yourself with TC.",however i was expecting something House-ier. there are a few cuts that can make the dancefloor but over all it's great for dinner parties and groovy times.
1,Progressive decline in creativity by T.C.,"It seems that since the Mirror Conspiracy, all these guys do is turn out endless variations of the same played-out sound"
4,Phatty tunes,"Phatty tunes... all with a new blend and mix of reggae, samba, symphony/electro, and euro taste."
4,"Funky, trippy bliss","I don't know much about dub or lounge, or whatever. I had one of their previous CDs (couldn't even tell you which one, since it's long sold) and it didn't do much for me, but this one is a keeper. It's got a lazy, trippy feel to it throughout. They get inspiration from a bunch of different psychedelic influences, and somehow melt it all together to make it work as a whole. Several very strong tracks here that will burn into your synapses, yet you can also enjoy it at low volume while doing something else. Cool stuff."
4,A solid entry in the Thievery canon,"Although it's not their first album, ""The Cosmic Game"" is easily the most hyped of the lot. That's great for the band; odds are more people will pick it up, but it would be a disaster if the first album they picked was a washout. Thankfully, it's far from a washout.The guest stars are at times impressive (Perry Farrell), inconsequential (The Flaming Lips), and downright horrible (David Byrne), but it's the no-names like Gunjan who make this album worth owning. It's got enough lounge music, enough world/ambient fusion, and enough of what made their previous albums so good, that it's not only a good starter for newbies, but it's solid enough for the hardcore fans to accept, even if it's not as outstanding as previous albums.*Special note* My Asian tour edition comes with ""Babylon Rewound"" free of charge, and as far as I know, is only available as an import. Well worth it for the bonus cd alone."
5,5 stars for Thievery taking it forward 5 for Cymande as well,"Its nice that Thievery is always paying hommage to the originators, ie Cymande, (pronounced sah-mahn-day). This is the first band to fuse funk, jazz and reggae between 1972-1974. Check out the recently released and remastered Cymande, Renegades of Funk. Cymande was an 8 piece live funk band from the West Indies that made it possible for acts like Thievery to proliferate this sound.Cymande invented it, with tracks like Bra, The Message, Dove, Bird, Fug, Genevieve, etc. So pay them their respect by checking out Cymande renegades of funk. Its that simple. Into our heart flies the Dove - Cymande."
5,Classic 'Thievery' riffs and groovy beats,"This is yet another high-quality, gold-standard Thievery Corp release. Fantastic reggae & Indian influenced riffs and groovy beats. I love albums you can just listen to from beginning to end without having to skip a song; always the case with their music. Stick the cd into your player and then sit 'relax' with a special friend or party with a bunch of pals and chill out. Love this album. So far I've love all their albums that I've come across, inclu ""Sounds (Songs?) from the Thievery HiFi"" and DJ Kicks and ""Richest Man in Babylon"". I need to investigate what else is out there. ""Versions"" in on order."
5,Pretty much a standard pairing,"This is basically just a pairing of The Cosmic Game with Babylon Rewound. If you already have these, this hasn't added anything. If you don't have these, get them."
3,Not what it used to be,It doesnt seem like they put the kind of imagination and personality as they have in their previous albums. This one bored me the be honest. In the middle of listening to it for the first time I felt like putting on one of their previous almubs that I have heard for the zillionth time. Its just too watered down for me.
5,Always smooth,"Thievery Corporation never fails to satisfy. The Cosmic Game continues their tradition of excellence. Once again combining Afro-Cuban beats and Eastern instruments with all manner of forms and subtle style changes, this album can be listened to again and again with enjoyment and discovery."
4,Not as good as The Richest Man In Babylon,"I like this album but it definitely has it's weak tracks. My favorite tracks are ""The Supreme Illusion"", ""Holographic Illusion"", ""Warning Shots"", ""Amerimacka"", ""A Gentle Dissolve"" and ""The Cosmic Game"", I think the weaker tracks are the ones with the celebrity guest vocalist. Like the weakest track on here is ""The Heart's a Lonely Hunter"" (Featuring David Bryne). It's just awful! Overall though the entire album is listenable so get check it out because the strong tracks definitely overpower the weak ones.SJwww.bestplaylists.com"
3,Enjoyable and Clean,"On the brink of adulthood, Joshua must figure out what to do with his life after graduation. Only he still hasn't felt a specific calling. What does God want him to do? How will he know, and what should he do in the meantime?Enjoyable and encouraging, this book focuses on discovering God's plan and the confusion that can accompany this journey. Winter Is Not Forever is the third book in the Seasons of the Heart series and a clean read.[...]"
1,No Hiding Place....Weak and Predicatable,"I love reading Tamara Hayle's mysteries, however this is the second one that I have read that was a disappointment with the characters and the climax of the mystery. I truly wish Ms. Wilson will create a more exciting love life for Tamara, starting out with maybe a steady man in her life. I also suggest better clients for her excellent skills and a more exciting role for her son Jamal instead of the usual unsteady teenager. I hope these suggestions will help in the next novel and I look forward Ms. Wilson."
3,Old favorite.,"Cookbook is an old favorite. Has some fabulous recipes in it.I bought this cookbook because the plastic binding on my own cookbook had begun to deteriorate.The cookbook is great , the condition (listed as ""good"") was not...condition not much better than the one I was replacing. Rating is probably not fair as it is only the condition of the book that was disappointing!"
1,Dissatisfied,The Archipelago Mango Tangerine Reed diffuser I purchased from Lucca had very little fragrance. I have purchased this product before from other sellers and have enjoyed it. I requested to have it replaced but my request was denied because I had used the product and did not have the original box. It is impossible not to use a Reed Diffuser product to determine that it is defective. I do not recommend purchasing any products from Lucca.
5,Awesome,The song is quite simple but the beat is fat and it is fun to dance to. I really enjoy the Cd and recomend it to anyone that likes to dance. Daisey looks pretty too.
1,"Written by a professor, for other professors","This book was a huge disappointment. It is overly technical, dense, and difficult to read. The author uses technical language to such an extent that his information is circular. Technical language to explain technical concepts leaves the reader who is not already an accountant in the dark. Here is an example. ""Assets are probably future economic benefits obtained or controlled by a particular entity as a result of past transactions or events. Future economic benefits refers to the capacity of an asset to benefit the enterprise by being exchanged for something else of value to the enterprise, by being used to produce something of value to the enterprise, or by being used to settle its liabilities."" (p. 24) If you think this kind of explanation is helpful, you might like this book. I have been in business for 25 years, and to me it is turgid and impossible."
2,Buy the newer Revised & Expanded version instead,"I'm not happy that Amazon recommended this edition to me without a mention that there is a newer, more complete version available... and Amazon offers the newer one at a lower price than this one, too! Sadly, this is a feature of Amazon's inadequate recommendation engine: they recommend inferior versions of the same product instead of later ones... it's really not very smart.It also seems odd to me that this book was published in March 2006, but the ""revised and expanded"" version is published November 2006. Surely at the time this version was published, they were aware that they would be making it obsolete a few months later with a more complete version. Perhaps they should have subtitled this book ""Incomplete & Unfinished in time for deadline version""."
2,Oblivion,This was an OK game. It filled the spot when I did not have anything else to do. It gets repetative after a while.
3,Kinda cool,If you like game guides in general than this is certainly a nice one. This was the first time using a game guide though and I don't think I'd ever get another one. All this information is redly available on the internet and the only reason to get this is if it's worth it to you to have it all collected in an easily readable book.
2,"Ok for main quests, but severely lacking in everything else","One word Peter: bigger, better, INDEX!Whoever wrote this ignored the ""small"" stuff, like where to buy the items he has listed. This doesn't sound like a big deal, but the world is big and that's why I bought the guide.You can find the quest info online for free, so I would pass on this guide."
4,Awesome,helped me a lot. there's so much in these kinds of games it's nice to have a guide to help you get every last bit out of your gameplay
4,A big Help,I enjpy these guides in a busy world we sometimes don;t have the time to figure everything out but this helps me get the most out of my game play.
4,Badly needs an index,Great attention to detail and you'll need it if your going to find your way around. The maps alone are worth the price.Shame about the 'index'.
1,The Elder Scrolls IV; Oblivion,"Not worth the $60 it cost me. No basic information at all. Totally useless as a teaching guide. I had to keep going online for the ""how to"" information I needed. I hate when they assume you know how to play based on earlier versions of the game you DID NOT buy."
4,Get the GOTY edition,"Was very good when first published, but I recommend getting the GOTY edition now (second printing) as it has all maps for the add-ons etc."
5,"Oblivion Walkthru, Help Guide","A nice Help Guide, A good Walkthru Manual.Lots of maps, photos, and advice.."
4,"Lots of info, not always easy to find though","I did a fair amount of research before buying Oblivion because I knew it was a dense game and mastering the information would help me enjoy the experience. This game guide has plenty of useful info, from maps to alchemy guides. It's not always easy to find what you're looking for because the organization is a little awkward, but it's still quite useful if you want a good reference book."
5,What a great game!,"This game has it all! It is so in depth and complex that you truly feel like you've entered another world.....one that is hard to leave. From the start of character creation to the multiple quests that are available, the game hooks you into it's environment & doesn't like to let you go! I've never been a big gamer, but Oblivion has definitely changed that."
4,"Not as good as everyone is claiming it to be, but....","It's still nice when you get stuck.It's really geared towards smash-and-bash characters, but the quest help alone is well worth the price."
2,A jumbled mess,"This 368 page thick book has one page, ONE PAGE table of contents, with about 20 entries, and with no index. Granted, the material in this book is excellent, but expect to spend frustrating hours and hours trying to find what you need.The existing organization also is horrendous. I wish Prima Games/Bethesda could explain to me how horses are a ""Freeform Quest""In addition: The map section is horrendous and dark. There is no overall map of the entire area.What I find so amazing is how so many reviewers can criticize the Fallout 3 guide for no index, when Fallout 3 has a 2 page table of context with around 400 entries, and yet so many reviewers gave this criminally disorganized book five stars. Herd mentality I guess?"
4,a good beginner book,The author wrote from his own experience and it's easy to relate to his stories. I wish it had a clearer structure to follow. Very nice pictures though.
4,Great introduction,"This is a very good introductory to cats. It covers a broad range of topics with a good amount of detail. I am an animal sciences major and we used this as a textbook in one of our courses, so that should tell you something about the quality of information.There are definite points of view expressed in this guide, but I've found them to be in line with everything else I have learned from the veterinary community as well as animal shelters. People may disagree with some of the stances taken by the ASPCA, but there is good evidence for those expressed in this book.The companion guide for dogs is identical in format, and some of the information in the health section is almost word-for-word the same. The two are very comparable in quality."
4,Heeding the past,"Siegelbaum has performed a valuable historical service by compiling these letters. Americans, and perhaps other Westerners, would do well to pay heed to what man wrought in that era, and its implications for our politically correct society of today. The outpourings of the hearts of Soviet citizens who were led to believe they were building the society of the future will, at times, make you want to cry. The responses from some of the Soviet leaders to their pleas make the blood run cold."
3,tame fare for horror fans,for young readers. may be frightening to preschoolers though tame compared to lovecraft or stoker. gave up half way through but it had me going for awhile. worth poking around but is too repetitive to spend more time.
3,"Basic, but not bad.","I think the concept of this book was to convince plumbers to alter their way of thinking and ""Pump Away"" (i.e. the location of the circulation pump in relation to the system).The book spends most of it's time exploring why you need to do this in very plain English for non-technical people, via stories.In my mind, it could be condensed into about 10 pages, as he's already considered an authority in the industry today. There's some extra examples near the end of the book that deal with different types of systems, but it's still just proving the original point.His other book ""Hydronic Radiant Heating"" is a much better book for exploring more depth for designing and implementing systems, I'm just starting it now and find it to be good reading."
3,Standard fair,"With this Barnes & Noble issued text on Jack the Ripper, you get a pretty condensed version of 'research. Basically you get a brief history on the canonical 5 Victims with a few possible extra victims thrown in. Follow this by brief listings and comments on possible suspects and conclude the book with Ripper related movies, books, tv appearnces, and even comics. This text is possibly a nice light introduction in Ripper studies but by no means is it any kind of authority on the subject. Think of it as 'The Dummies Guide to Jack the Ripper'. Possibly decent for the beginner but offers little in the way of original thought except for comments on the various movie takes on JtR."
5,A ledgendary performance,"This is the best Mariah video ever. Once you see it you just want to see it over again and again, it really shows way back when she was on the way to becoming one of the worlds greatest entertainers. Even if you ain't a fan this still has lots of terrific music the songs that everyone knows like hero and dreamlover. Seriously buy it you'll love it."
3,Not as good as I thought it would be,"Not as good as I thought it would be, just not enough hits on a hit album. I'd send it back, but I guess I'll keep it."
4,Niblockdown,"Niblock's approach to these 24 track guitar samples are fascinating. It takes time to unfold, and even 20 minutes into the piece, little is revealed. There are some slight differences in Guitar too, four Four Part One and Part Two - slight pitch changes. Niblock stresses that this recording be played at extreme volumes. The drone is slow but is quite loud. This is my first experience with Niblock's music, and it's a very good place to start."
5,Quick,"This product arrived very quickly and was in just the shape the seller said it would be in. It is a very old book so it could have been in terrible shape but it isn't, and I am very thankful since I am giving it to my daughter for Christmas."
4,Plastic is the way to go,"I am allergic to metal and have a hard time finding watches to wear. Good thing I work at a school, because the kids really like the different watches I wear when I can find them. I only wish that they would make more that have the plastic bands and clasps."
3,"A useful guide, but contains many inaccuracies and omissions","It's definitely useful to have an A-Z guidebook to NY's many immigrant groups. But this book has many shortcomings and inaccuracies. For example, it barely mentions the huge Russian presence in Brighton Beach, and its section on Germans ignores their best restaurants in the Glendale section of Queens. Errors include a statement that the early Greek immigrants settled in the South Bronx between 14th and 15th Streets (there are no such streets in the Bronx!) and locating the Masjid Al Farouq mosque between 4th and 5th Streets, when it is really between 4th and 5th Avenues."
4,"Well made, magnets are large.","Good speaker overall for the money, the magnets seem to be larger than needed so make sure to check the spacing behind your speaker."
4,Having Fun,Start with simple pantomimes for individual and mixed group settings. Build up to more exacting pantomimes and charades. Then move on to skits. It is all fun!
5,"Good product, high price","At night I have a scratchy throat when trying to get to sleep. Cepacols are the only cough drops that seem to work in remedying the problem. I guess for the price, they should."
5,Love Fianna,"This was the 2nd bratz I bought. Somehow, I lost it. However, I just ordered a new one. You have to get this Bratz. She is extremely beautiful and her hair is silky with great streaks. I recommend this to everyone"
4,Majora's Mask Ultamet Stratigy guide,"You Should buy this guide because it tells you every little secret, were the wepones are, the tresers, and maps every dungen. It even gives the information on the enamy monsters and were you can find them. Next it will tell the boses of every dungen and were the 15 faries are in all the four tempels. It will even tell were you get every mask and every one that has a problem for the bombers note book. finaly it will tell you all the songs for the orcana, were and how to get them.(You may find some spelling mastakes for I am a terable speller.)"
5,Awesome Guide!!,"When I first began playing Ocarina of Time, I couldn't figure out what to do even only a little bit into the game. After that I went out and bought my first perfect guide. It gave me everything. As soon as I got Majora's Mask, I knew I couldn't live without the Perfect Guide again so I went out and bought it. It gave me a step by step way to get all the masks, heart peices, stray fairies and a thorough walkthrough of all the dungeons. All the other guides tell you to do things out of order so you have to go back and see if you missed anything. Versus Books Gives it all in the right order."
4,Early Frogs in Action!,"Early Frogs in Action!This book ""The Naked Warriors"" is a survey and history of the United States Navy Underwater Demolition Teams (UDT) formed in World War II, the forerunners to the modern Navy SEALs. The book details the tactics, operations, and training, at a time when the United States as in many other technical areas, was well behind the state of the art, playing catch up to Italian and German naval Special Forces. This book is poorly referenced, but overall, I have found this book to be highly readable and although the material is dated it is still historically significant in the study of modern special warfare. I believe that this title will appeal to the professional and armchair military historian and serving military personnel."
2,Ok...I'm gonna be cruel.,"Get this if you're mostly a Lou Reed fan; the Velvet Underground this is NOT! This is Lou's project. The songs are nice, but it's NOT the Velvet Underground. The VU is John, Moe, Sterl & Lou(with Nico). Moe wasn't even around for the recording of LOADED; it was basically Lou, a little bit of Sterling, Doug Yule and his brother filling for Moe. The Velvet Underground(the 3rd album) functions MUCH better as a post-Cale Velvets album...it still retains that minimalistic experimentalism. LOADED sounds desparate for hits...it sounds forced. Ofcourse, this is just me."
3,Better than Self Titled,"But only because of Sweet Jane, which was the first Velvets song I ever heard. This band has a nasty habit of dropping it's members. First we lost Nico, then Cale, and Maureen Tucker doesn't even play on this record. Instead we have.... Doug Yule! <sarcasm>Oh Joy!</sarcasm>Sweet Jane is awesome, Rock And Roll is good and I like Who Loves The Sun, but the rest isn't really worth hearing. The outtakes are also rather boring. You'd do better to get the Peel Slowly and See box set."
3,Three good songs and then filler,"Weel worth getting for the first three songs, the rest of this album will have you hitting the ""skip"" button on your cd player. An overrated band with a small, inexplicably devoted following."
5,Enthralling,"Fourth and last studio album of the Velvet Underground. This one is not as much provocative as the previous studio albums, and therefore is seen as more commercial. But that doesn't mean worse in any way. Some of the songs have become classics which reappear in a variety of versions in the live work of Lou Reed, especially Sweet Jane"", Rock & Roll"" and New Age"", which are also the ones that I like the most. This edition contains to each original song also a demo version. It is very enthralling to watch how these songs have been evolved."
2,Didn't like fragrance,"I really did not like this fragrance. Not something that I could wear. Rather than sending it back which I probably couldn't anyway, I sold it to a friend - she loved it."
1,Editional Dysfunction,"""The fault is not in our stars, but in ourselves,"" Shakespeare wrote. For whatever reason, I never checked (nor was it listed) what particular EDITION of this book was available for sale. Needing the 3rd edition, I wound up with the 2nd edition, which was, for me, totally useless. The posting on Amazon did NOT specify the edition. Because of a pending seminar deadline (I'm a 69 year-old graduate student), I was forced to buy a new 3rd edition of the book at retail. So, I now have two versions (one outdated) of the same tome, which, in my effort to save money, cost me considerably more than I had anticipated."
1,Horrible!!,"oh my god!! I just bought a 4 pack of cds from baby genius because of their great reputation and did I ever learn my lesson! this is awful stuff. If you are looking for the nice old tunes you grew up with, this is one nasty surprise. The music is discordant, accompanied by electric guitars and keyboards and a chorus of kids who, while cute, can drive you mildly insane!! I was looking for something in the line of the Disney Favorites cd and this was such a steal but now I just hope I can return the darned thing!! I really did give it a try in the car and home but it just gave me a headache and did nothing to calm my child. If I wanted electric noise and distortion I would turn to the local rock station not resort to a baby cd. Isn't it agreed that children thrive on calming music or at least on music.... not on noise!!"
4,The Complete Guide to the Book of Proverbs is more current.,"Hubbard's commentary is in-depth and accurate. He quotes the New King James Version but corrects mistakes such as Proverbs 30.1 where he correctly states that ""Ithiel and Ucal"" should be tranlated as phrases rather than names. Biblical archaelogy and scholarship has made significant progress in the last 10 years since this book was written (1989). For a more up-to-date in-depth commentary on Proverbs read THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO THE BOOK OF PROVERBS by Cody Jones. It features numerous drawings and photos which give the reader a sense of the culture of the time. Six translations in parallel aid understanding of more difficult passages. Jones reveals for the first time in any commentary the secret identity of the overall editor of King Solomon's wise and witty sayings."
2,Burned out in two months,"This unit is very lightly built and burned out in two months. The dashboard dimmer was flakey from the beginning. I replaced it with a unit costing twice as much, but in the end this unit was no bargain."
3,It could be better--grammatically!,"It's OK. However, it does have grammatical errors for the Spanish language. It seems that this book was just ""literally"" translated from an English version--to Spanish---it leaves out certain Spanish language details, an example: In the Spanish alphabet there is an ""ll"" and a ""rr"", and other alphabet letters that are left out! Plus, there are other errors. It's Ok--untill I find a better substitute."
5,Great Product!,We use 100's of these every year and are very happy with the quality. We will certainly be back for more in the future.
1,Non Sticking Adhesive,"Not worth the purchase, the adhesive on these envelopes doesn't stick so I need to apply tape to every one to ensure that it doesn't open during shipping. I won't order these again."
1,Be careful,"While I don't have a problem with this product itself, I do have a problem with how it's listed on Amazon. The sizes and description were not clear, or it was changed after I ordered these. They were not even close. I needed them for DVDs and the size I got might hold a coin. The sizes are not clear. Be careful when ordering because these are very small!"
4,Great price for these,"These are perfect for shipping out thin items, like small photos or trading cards, to keep them protected. As with most mailers the inside dims are less than the labeled size. These do seem a little smaller inside than the jiffy-lites, but they are sturdy and the glue on the seal is great, no need to overtape. They are not as padded as the previous jiffy-lite mailers I'd been using, but the jiffy-lites were very expensive per/mailer compared to these. These mailers also arrived pretty much ""dumped"" into the packaging box, but that doesn't bother me; it might concern the tidy, engineer mentality that needs to have neat stacks and bundles. You won't feel like sitting there and counting out 500 scattered mailers to make sure you received your entire shipment. But again, for the price, you get what you pay for, I got it and am extremely pleased. Shipped fast and arrived in excellent condition. Will order these again."
3,Very pretty,The sandals are beautiful but very uncomfortable. It's too bad because they are perfect.
4,Big hassle with USPS (shipping/ delivery).,"Sender's self-metering was $0.39 short, and USPS would not deliver unless difference was paid. I told USPS we didn't keep cash/change, but he threatened to return the item. We went back and forth for about 10 to 15 minutes, and I started putting on my shoes to see if there was change in the car, when my wife had found $0.40. Then USPS refused to provide the penny change because they don't carry cash/change. I insisted on the change because of the huge hassle I was given, but USPS walked away and said a check would be sent me within a few days. For a penny? Fat chance! Also, although item was in very good condition, it had been advertised as new."
3,Small letter/ hard to find numbers vs meaning.,"I am a fanatic for visual dictionaries or pictorials. The Oxford-Duden Pictorial Spanish and English Dictionary is very good if you don't mind to spend 10-15 seconds in finding the meanings in the list related with the number. I rather have a line or arrow pointing the translation. Despite of that it is an excellent resource, and has tons of translation with different meanings.Soy un fanático de los diccionarios visuales. Este diccionario es muy bueno si a alguien no le importa invertir 10-15 segundos buscando la relación del el numero con la palabra. Yo prefiero aquellos diccionarios visuales que tienen una línea señalando la palabra junto al gráfico. Aun así es un recurso excelente que tiene toneladas de traducciones en diferentes modismos y significados."
1,cheap jewelry that breaks,It is a cheap piece of jewelry that broke on the shank in the first week I had it. I will never buy from this vendor again.
5,Great Seller,This was the second time I purchased ankh rings from this sellar. This is a great price for a great product. It was also delivered very quickly!
1,I only give it one star because I can't give zero.,"My doc was amazed when I told him how much of the Natrol DHEA I'd been taking, because my numbers were so low. He said my DHEA should be around 200, and it's 83.3 AFTER a month of 100mg/day, when he usually recommends 10-25/day, depending on your levels. Not sure what's in this, but it sure as heck isn't 25mg of DHEA."
4,A healthy source of energy,"I have used this product for at least 10 years.It seems to help my level of energy.And, supports my immune system."
3,Are you there?,"Not sure if DHEA is working or I am just getting old.. May have a placebo effect, erections seems harder. My impression is I can have sex for longer times than I used too, well compared to the last 5 years, I'm not talking about when I was 18.. Also, my pecs are less droopy."
1,Be careful with this stuff,I bought this thinking it would help with hormone balancing. I only took it for a few days because I got a headache whenever I took it.
3,"I have not received 2 packs, only 1. Was there any mis-understanding on my part?","Was there any mis-understanding on my part? I thought I should receive 2 bottles, but I only got 1 bottle."
4,Very interesting! Funny! Cute!,"This is a very interesting DVD if you want to explore the ""raw"" side of the animal world. It certainly has plenty of invigorating moments. There is a sense of adventure that is conveyed through the various scenes, which thrill the mind, arouse the emotions and stir the spirit, as one engages intellectually with the vivid reality of nature's wild, violent and merciless side. I cannot recommend this content to anyone who has any fear of such animal behavior. You will be scared. However, if you like to know more about wild animals, especially the ferocious ones, this DVD will take you on an unforgettable journey into the heart of nature's wildest beasts."
2,Is that really Red?,"The picture looks very red, but what I got in the mail was more like a ""shocking Salmon"". I had purchased this a few years ago and it does not match the product I received."
2,MUSICAL GENUIS?,The remixes on this song are okay but the song itself is forgettable. This sounds like everything else on the radio. I guess that's okay but what happened to the Prince who created new sounds?
3,CD examples need update,CD examples are dependent on the common code for the samples in the DirectX SDK. The examples do not compile with the current Direct X SDK. Check the publishers website for an update with no such luck.(Edit)I can't edit my rating. I didn't realize I could install an old version of the SDK side by side with the new version. The book itself is very good.
3,Not quite what I expected,"I ordered this paper hoping that it would be a heavier paper than it turned out to be, but the overall paper quality was fine.What I found really disappointing was the condition it arrived in. Amazon failed to place enough packing in the box to cushion the weight of the paper. As a result the ream split open its packaging and some of the paper had bent edges. Something to think about before you order paper.Frankly I've come to expect better packing from Amazon and was disappointed that this happened."
1,4 packages of Printer cardstock paper,I ordered 4 packages of paper and I received only a half of 1 package that looked like it had been scraped up from the store. I returned the package and was never reimbursed for the other three packages of paper. I kept getting messages that I had to return the other 3 packages to be reimbursed and I argued until the time ran out and I guess it is SCREW ME NOW. Thanks Amazon.com!
1,RATHER DISAPPOINTED,"The reams packaging is weak, so by the time they reach you the packaging is not in the best of condition, but most of all: 90 lb index card is not as thick as I expected and you too may be disappointed if you do not get a sample of a 90 lb index card, even 110 would probably be unsatisfactory if you are using it for a booklet cover"
2,Mis represented product,"This two-CD set is in fact not so much a tool to learn Latin as it is a slew of latin words and phrases repeated at you. The critical part of latin is that it is an inflected language, that is, the words change with the meaning (amare, amas, i love, you love, and so on).The second CD is basically a list of phrases. Since no country in the world speaks latin anymore, phrases like ""let's have lunch"" and ""I have a head ache"" are about as useful as ""puella et pisces capuit"" (the girl and the fish fall).For 17.95, this is an adequate supplemental learning tool. It's hardly going to teach latin, and the sub title ""Start speaking Latin Today"" is certainly a misnomer. Save your money and get a copy of Wheelock's Latin and the Rosetta Stone software. Or better yet, take a class."
2,"soso, could be better","I am a beginner level. This one had multiple people speaking, both men and women.On a totally subjective note, no one had a voice that was too annoying to listen to.On another even more totally subjective note, it was a little annoying because it sounded to me like Latin with a strong American accent. Admittedly, I am not an authority on this and latin is a dead language, after all, with no classical Latin speaking Romans around to compare to.On a slightly less subjective note, what I want most on a language audio track is vocabulary and this one didn't have enough of that for me. Rather they skipped all the common latin mottos/legal phrases and given more straight up vocab."
5,Great and exciting!,"This is a great book! It keeps you on the edge of your seet the entire time!!I'm like Carol. I know alot about horses and this is my favorite SC ! Make sure when you read this, you have alot of time because you'll need to take a breather!"
3,Could have been a great book,"This book does cover all of the objectives presented. The format and gramatical errors destroy most of benefits. I used this book and failed the ACRC exam 640-403. The ACRC Exam Certification Guide, author: Clare Gough-CCIE #2893 is a much better book. The questions are more difficult, the CD that accompanies the book is harder than the actual test. I couldn't answer some of them, even read Todd Lammle's book. I placed the three next to each other and thumbed through the chapters. The main difference is the ACRC Exam Guide has several CCIE technical editors who are precise. This is the best $60.00 bucks I've spent since the ICRC guide by Laura Chappel. I even noticed that some of the questions presented in this book were similar to the CCIE Written Examination."
3,Could be better,"I'm not sure if I have an older revision, or if the people giving it 5 stars are... well... asleep at the keyboard. While, yes, it does cover 90% of the ACRC exam, there are MANY errors and typos (checked against CCO). After finding the errors, I passed the exam with an 850... before finding the errors, by relying on this book, I scored 727. My suggestion... if ANYTHING looks wrong, check it with CCO... or check EVERYTHING with CCO to be on the safe side."
3,"Good concepts, poor implementation","The concepts of this book are great - it explains the steps the router takes to accomplish a task. Unfortunately, the implementation isn't what I expected. Perfect example is setting up NAT. This book explains everything about how nat works, what it does and how it does it, but it doesn't give the OS commands to implement it! For the price, I would think that could be included."
2,I would give a 5 stars...,"After passed ACRC exam on the first shot, I would give this book a 5 stars if there were not so many errors. It covers right topics but there are just too many errors everywhere. I agree that it seems no editor at all and they just cut-and-paste from CCO (There are places they even pasted to the wrong location!) It's really painful to read this book especially at first time. First, you need to GUESS what it's trying to say. Then you have to VERIFY whether it says is correct or not.This is what they say at the preface of the book: ""...Each book is crafted with care and precision..."" But it doesn't seem true to me!"
2,very much lacking,"This book could have been much, much more than it ended up. I bought it without having read any kind of review and I definitely regret it. After having read a far superior book on ACRC (Semester Five Companion Guide), I have to say that this book lacks too much in detail for the price. There are numerous errors (which you can view errata on the Cisco Press web site, it's massive) in this book as well that can confuse the reader tremendously. I only buy Cisco Press books, but had this been my first, I may have reconsidered. Mark McGregor did a much better job writing the Academy curriculum."
1,Cisco Press just lost my credibility after I read this book.,Cisco should recall this book and save their reputation.It is a pity that they brushed this one out the door. Could have been a great book. I think Laura was rushed since the first one was much better.They must know that you will probably end up buying this since they are not many alternate publishers.
1,Was there an editor for this book?,"Well, I'm halfway through this book and have, just by casual observance, listed 5 pages of typos, technical errors, incorrect formatting and just plain incorrect information. Was there an actual editor for this book or did they just cut-and-paste from CCO? I'm sure that the ACRC exam will be a breeze for anyone who completes this book but caveat emptor is an understatement. If you actually want to learn something, as opposed to just getting another acronym on the business card, go to the lab and try as many commands as you can vs. what the book says."
3,Good Info but...............,"I thought this book was full of useful information but I found the CCNA Study Guide from Sybex a better book as far the exam goes. It is more organized and emphasizes the test objectives. This book by Chappell has the same objectives but they are not as clear. If you are not planning to take the exam, this book is great. Otherwise, get the Sybex CCNA Study Giude."
4,Lovely book,"I am new to the arts and craft decorating style but absolutely adore it and I thought this book gave a really good feel for the interior decorating schemes in general, lots of photos showing repeating common motifs (?motives?) and furniture and also a section at the end showing houses that have used it in a modern sense. I think it is a really good, well presented book!! :)"
4,Great voice.,This song is so unreal. Jennifer has such a great voice. Plus she's a beautiful young woman. This song is wonderful and great for young people in love.
1,misrepresentation,"The CD is just a sampler with one song and clips of a few others. Probably used for sales and marketing. Not really worth having. The music itself from J. Day may be ok, there is just not much of anything on the CD"
5,Its Great dont listen to the other post!,Jennifer Day is Awsome and I think she will be big. Her video is Awsome 2
2,Song isn't that orignial,"There are way too many similar sounding, pop influenced, songs like this out in country radio right now. This one will probably get lost in the shuffle as well. It isn't that bad of a song, but it isn't that good either. My advice would be to save your money on this one."
4,I Always Enjoy Perry,"Good mystery. I stopped to think about the solution several times and got one part of it right, but not the details. Laughed at some fun banter between Perry and Della. I really liked the DA in this one. I would have liked to have seen less courtroom, more action, but still a good story nonetheless."
4,Terrific read,I love twists in a story and this was one that had it all. Great read and quite fun too.
5,case of the run away corpse,Love all of the Perry Mason series. Gardner was a great writer. Great read I loved it and so will you.
5,whoa.,"""Atmospheres"" was enough to make me buy this album. just try to imagine what eternity might sound like. okay, now you know exactly what Atmospheres is. wow. who else could having captured the feelings that are in this score? this is above talented. this is above genius. this is above avand garde. this is too good to be labeled as anything at all."
2,Ok disc,"I thought this disc had the radio song on it, but I was wrong. It's ok if you like listening to a sound track. If you want the song they played on the radio buy Deodato Prelude."
4,2001 Space Odyssey CD,"Product came through in good time and in excellent shape, containing everything I had anticipated."
3,"pretty good sounding remaster, except...","This is a pretty good sounding remaster, except that on track 11(Lux Aeterna), there is some pretty nasty distortion in the vocal choir. I have seen this movie many times and this seems to be on the original print of the movie (I have heard these nasties every time). I was hoping that when they re-mastered this recording that they would fix this problem. I know this is a really old recording; is it possible that this distortion is on the original master tape - that the technology at the time was so limited that the choir just overloaded the tape? I don't know.Otherwise, this is a very nice sounding recording. The next-to-last song on this disk is very weird. I think I read that they had intended to include it in the movie; I'm glad they didn't! Overall this sounds noticeable better than I remember the original CD being."
5,"""2001 A Space Odyssey: Film Sound track","This soundtrack recalls an all time classic film. With its well thought out musical portfolio it helped to portray the magnificence and beauty of space travel in such a manner that, when combined with the stunning space shots and lunar landscape, it created pure visual poetry.My order was fulfilled promptly."
3,"Good, but not the best, Asterix book....","It is important to note that this book is based on the film ASTERIX VERSUS CAESAR which, in turn, is based on an adaptation of the books ASTERIX THE GLADIATOR and ASTERIX THE LEGIONARY. So it is three levels of abstraction from ""original."" Also, the format is a linear text supplemented by many really beautiful reproductions of cells from the movie. Although it is beautiful to look at, and possible to read, it lacks much of the essential pacing and timing that Goscinny and Uderzo are such masters of when working in the traditional ""panels with word balloons"" format of ""comic"" books. I imagine it's a good companion to the film, and it certainly is lovely to look at, but it strikes me as less ""essential"" than most of the other Asterix books. Buy it if you are a completist... or even if you just happen to have and love a bunch of the others. Save it for later if you're just getting acquainted with our friends from the small village of indomitable Gauls."
1,How to succeed no matter what,"I bought these two books in a bookshop. It looked appealing the andean look, southamerican kind of philosophy. Unfortunately, when I opened this book, I realized it was more like guidelines how to win in life, how to succeed, avoiding all information about learning from mistakes, about inadequacy feelings or else, that as human beings we experience several times. I missed the heart.It appears at a first glance as appealing, but it falls immediately into superficiality and poverty of arguments.I wouldn't buy it again. The author should first take a course ""How to open the heart"", learn how to express his ideas and then to write a book."
1,Very disappointing,"It's incredible what marketing can do... To create the illusion and make it appear as true. In the back cover of this book, it says that ""it is the most important book in the world"". How can someone be so pretentious and arrogant to state that he is the author of the most important book in the world? It just shows crystal clearly that what is inside is far from anything good.It is targeted to ""leaders, revolutionaries...."", how pretentious!"
5,Wonderful CD...for Baby or entire family!,"I bought this CD for our baby, hoping to let it lull him to sleep each night. While it IS wonderful for that, I also found it to be very soothing to my sometimes frazzled nerves! My favorite piece is the Morning Bird Melody. I teach 4th grade and have even taken this to school to share with my class! Now my students ASK me to put this CD in for them to listen to while they work! It's wonderful...a must have, for sure!"
1,"Really,bad,bad and bad","Well im sorry to say that you would think a man singing funny songs what can go wrong ,even the reviews wore good why?Not only was everything poorly done from fliming and singing nothing made sense and it was beyond boring.My son who is 2 looked at me like why are you make me watch this he hated it.Please skip this run far far away from this!"
3,"Get ""The Fine Friends Are Here"" DVD instead!","We have this DVD and the Fine Friends Are Here, as well. My kids love the Fine Friends and watch that one over and over. On this All Around the Kitchen DVD, they only stay somewhat interested in the ""videos"" half, and they don't seem to like ""the show"" half at all. It's especially a pain in the car on long trips because each half of the DVD is fairly short (the two sections don't autoplay, once one is over it goes back to the main menu)Overall, this one is unfortunately not popular around here, but the Fine Friends DVD is great, much more appealing to my kids, ages 1 1/2 and 3 1/2."
1,poor quality,"very poor audio quality. i still enjoy dan zanes songs on disney channel but this dvd is a different story. never played it again ever since it arrived and we checked it out the first day.Bought after reading other reviews, dont know why others are raving about, could be his friends."
5,Great to inspire music-making in little ones,"My husband and I love this DVD (and all Dan Zanes' music)! The song selections are wonderful and my 2 1/2 year old son loves to sing and dance around the house to the music. His favorite is ""Strike the Bell""; my favorite is the Father Goose medley.I prefer Dan Zanes' music to Laurie Berkner because to me, it feels like ""real music"" versus ""children's music"". I also like that I'm exposing my son to a group of performers that are diverse (different ethnicities, ages, male and female) and clearly love to play music.I would recommend this to anyone with children!"
5,"When you want your child to be more ""interactive"" with the t.v. ...","... pop in this DVD. My 18 mo old asks for this every day. She has learned the hand movements to ""Strike the Bell,"" she's learned ""Hola!"" from ""Hello, hello, hello,"" and she wiggles & dances to ""All Around the Kitchen."" It's a wonderful, fun, completely adult-friendly DVD."
5,Dan the Man,My three year old loves this DVD. He asks for Dan to be put on all the time and then dances around the room like a spring chicken (but not as coordinated). It is seriously fun.
5,Can I give it more than 5 stars?,"My 4 and 6 year old kids have watched this video at least 50 times in the two months since we got it and I can honestly say we ALL still love it. (And we have all the Dan Zanes CD's, so we knew all the songs by heart already anyway). Their enthusiasm is surpassed only by their musicianship. They cover traditional kids' songs, folk songs, work songs and sea songs, along with original songs and it all works. This is great joyful live music, nothing contrived or watered down for children. If you find most kid's music cloying or artificial, then this is the video for you."
3,Not really videos,"I think there were two ""videos"" on this. I was hoping for more by the title. The rest was concert footage and videos with people singing. It wasn't a hit with the kiddo here, although I like the songs."
1,boring for kids,"the majority of this dvd is live footage from a concert. the band is cramped on the stage, the audience is cramped in the theatre, and the camera is so cramped it hardly moves - it is VERY dull to look at. there are a few videos at the end of the dvd but the best one is ""jump up"" which is often shown on sesame street. it was based on that video that i decided to buy the dvd, and it turns out that is the only entertaining one."
3,OK for older toddlers.,I got this video because my children love music. The music on the video is good but the video accompanying it leaves much to be desired. You might as well just put in the cd because my kids have no desire to watch the video of him singing. His music is fun and entertaining though.
2,Not Happy,I have a 2 year old and have seen him on all the Kids Channels. I was hoping the DVD would show each of his songs as they are performed on TV. Instead it was like a concert and did not keep my attention nor my sons. This would have been a better CD instead of a DVD
3,Dan Zanes & Friends,"My 21 month old daughter did not like this dvd at all. I think it will be a dvd she will enjoy as she gets older. My daughter continues to be a big fan of Laurie Berkner and will watch nothing else! I gave Dan Zanes & Friends 3 stars, because even though my daughter did not enjoy the dvd, I did!"
5,Awesome DVD,"My husband purchased this for our son, he loves it....as parents, we even sing along! Dan's music is catchy and not at all annoying after hearing it for the 100th time! I've since purchased for all my friends with toddlers as gifts :-)"
4,Great Music DVD for the whole family,At first I was disappointed by the video and production quality. But my 1 1/2 year old and my husband and I LOVE the music. Its great folk music that mixes in some Reggae. We love dancing along.
5,Awsome fantasy fiction!!,"This was the best book I have ever read!!I'm currently looking for the 5th book, but I can't find it!What I really want to do is buy the whole series together.I need to know: how many books are in the whole series, if she's written them all, and where could I but them?If you know, email me at LanenKae@a0l.com"
2,"Had potential, but...","As I read this book to my shy 3 year old dauther, I found that I needed to add text to clarify to her what was going on. Although the premise for the book is good, I feel it was not well written. I also was somewhat taken aback by the verbal cruelty of Charles' parents. Basically they told him he wouldn't amount to anything and some might spank him, just for being shy. This is NOT the message I wanted to send my kid. In the end, Charles shows everybody what he's made of, and they say thank you, but no one ever apologizes to him. I suppose you could argue that this represents the real world, but wow, how harsh. Since my daughter loves the illustrations, we keep reading and I keep add-libbing."
1,unfortunate name-calling in this book,"We are tried and true Rosemary Wells fans, and are familiar with most of her books. I borrowed this one from the library, and was disappointed to find Charles' parents expressing their frustration through language like ""another mother would have spanked you"" for not saying thank you or goodbye (maybe Wells could have the mother model good manners rather than threatening punishment)and the father actually calling him names for not participating in football, which Dad forced on him. What a negative approach to modeling the behavior you want your child to adopt, never mind giving parents the idea that it's OK to treat a child in this manner. Needless to say, I edited it heavily when I read it, then returned it to the library post haste! Not one for my library!"
4,Shy? Sweet Charles is Just Autistic,"This is a charming little book about a boy who will not say thank you even for the most wonderful treats, will not speak on the phone, is quite clumsy, and who prefers to play all alone. If you have an autistic youngster in your family, its as plain as the cute nose on Charle's face - he is autistic.There's a bit of political incorrectness regarding the father's thoughts and words toward Charles, but the dad's frustration is something autistic families will relate to.I love the near ending - and the real ending. Charles musters himself to the task of using the phone well enough to call an ambulance, helping an injured adult get up off the floor, and even showing empathy by bringing her a cup of cocoa. Yet at the tale's end, he is back to not talking! The story shows there's nothing wrong with being autistic. Its just how some people are...and they deserve our respect."
1,So Confused,"This is quite possibly one of the worst children's books I have ever read. I am a school social worker always searching for books to read to my students, but Shy Charles simply does not make the cut. This book is really poorly written and the ideas don't seem connected well enough for children to actually understand. As many other reviewers have mentioned, the book is essentially a story about a mother and father rebuking their child for being shy. The book is apparently supposed to rhyme, but the rhyme scheme is so bad that I didn't even notice until about the 10th page. If your looking for a book to gently guide shy children to be more social, this is not the book for you. Do not waste your money."
2,Misleading,Nice book- but I presumed from the description it was tp support students that had trouble speaking - not that they were just shy - it is a nice story but shouldnt be advertised as an aid.
5,Another fine departure,"The album continues the sure footed evolution of Ian's work (or play, depending on your perspective)! You can hear Ian's own thread moving on from the earlier JT sound without any damage to either. Continuing as a leading element in a too small group of artists who have stayed vital and keep producing without bogging down in or riding too long on the days of their youth.... um, and I really, really like it and wish I'd listened to it 5 years ago!"
5,BREATHTAKING!,"Poetry set to music...thoughtful...provocative. It is difficult to find the words to adequately describe this album because it covers so much territory. From the heart-wrenching ""Sanctuary"" to the ebullient ""Habanero Reel"",each song is an individual work of art. The music seems to come from the far reaches of the universe,with many musical elements represented in such a fashion that everything that was old becomes new again,and everything that is new becomes timeless. Ian Anderson is a musician and a poet of the highest caliber. BRAVO!"
2,"Wimpy, disappointing.........","Although I am a big Ian Anderson fan, this CD has really disappointed me. I have had it for two weeks now, and I am already sick of it. While the music was nice, Ian's vocals left a lot to be desired. He, well, he sounds wimpy on this CD. He just sounds so unlike himself--- I was expecting more of a Jethro Tull-sounding Ian, not this nasally Ian. And I just don't get what the big deal is about the 'language of birds'---the song really turns me off. I wish I would never has wasted the money on this CD. I have his Divinities CD, which was nice, but the vocals on THIS one---AWFUL!! I should have bought some more Jethro Tull, NOT this bland redundant boring CD! (Sorry, Ian!)"
1,Are you kidding?,"I have been a fan of Ian Anderson's for years, but this cd is terrible. Not one single pleasant melody or interesting flute lead. And then to end it with one of my less favorite songs from his classical work, and...to top it off, yet another version of Thick as a Brick? What the heck for? A real shame as I was very excited about this project. And face it, his voice is shot. Maybe time to bring in some other singers on his music. At least Dot Com had some interesting music."
4,Good record and one GREAT song,"Very listenable all the way through but one track has been sent throught my speakers ad nauseum: Boris Dancing. Saw Tull play this gem in 2001 and that performance made me purchase the CD. If you're a Tull fan, this one song is worth the price of admission. One of the catchiest instrumentals Ian has ever done. To me, that's saying something."
5,Buy it!,"This CD hasn't left my player in the 2 weeks since I've had the disk. Certainly Ian's best solo outing and easily ranks with Tull's best efforts, if not the best. Breathtaking musicianship, arrangements and writing. Ian goes from strength to strength and there isn't a clinker in the bunch. English, Irish and Celtic folk, Indian influences -- a wonderful stew of his musical influences and leanings. Another notch in Ian's belt and yet one more reason to justify our love affair with his work over the past 30+ years."
2,The alarm works,"Snooze button,light on face and battery cover are difficult to use. Rather flimsy. Alarm did work but will look for another one before my next trip."
2,I couldn't hear the alarm,"I bought this clock to wake me up while I'm sleeping away from home. At first, I thought the alarm didn't work at all, but when I experimented with it, I found that when I was wide awake, the alarm was barely audible. Admittedly, my hearing is not great, but I do hear other alarms just fine, so this clock was definitely a disappointment. I would have given it just one star, but it does tell time well..."
2,Rabbit Harness,"We had a hard time getting the harness on the rabbit, and then when we finally did, he managed to get his front legs out of it. Once we got it all settled, we kept the harness on him for awhile and he chewed through it."
3,"Old ""Skool"" Kung Fu!!","After checking out this flick, I felt the 5 star rating by a previous reviewer is grossly overrated, and profoundely exaggerated. I have many flicks with the great Kwan Jang Lee,,,and believe me, this is nothing close to his talent!! Yes,,there is no question this is an o.k flick. The choreography and cinematography is well put together. However, almost all copies of the Dvd transfer is remarkably poor. It's unfortunate watching this flick with such poor picture and sound quality,, but definately a flick to have as part of the collection!!"
3,Museum in a book ...,"Rob Carter is a fine typographer and a great teacher. This book, however, is not so much a tool as it is a display case. Don't buy this book if you want any instruction on working with computer type that you can't get from analyzing projects for yourself."
4,plenty of bottom booty & high spirits,"This younger P-Funk inspired group always had better chops (& live shows) than ""songs,"" & compared to George Clinton they were somewhat lacking in the shall we say ""concept"" department. The band survived long after some of the key players had split. But Slave had plenty of bottom booty & high spirits. The great number on this debut album is ""Slide"" (& the variation ""Son of Slide""). One of the ""best of"" compilations will do nicely for an introduction. But I recommend seeking out the original ""The Concept"" LP, which has some dazzling weirdness, or just about anything else they released on vinyl. What? You gave away your turntable?"
2,Not for heavy cameras,I found this to be just a little to giving when using heavy lenses. Maybe lighter camera and lens would be better. Just did not feel secure to me.
5,Read 'One for the Money' and got hooked!,"I picked up 'One For The Money' at a local bookstore after reading a review of the newest book in the series - I got hooked! I just finished 'Three To Get Deadly' yesterday and I am going to the store tonight to get the next one! Another reviewer said Stephanie never learns from her mistakes. Well, if she did we wouldn't have the laughs these books give us. I know there is a little of her in me - I don't always apply what I learned in the past to a new situation - sometimes we just forget at the time. She has alot of spunk and resilience! I really enjoy these books and look forward to more and more Stephanie Plum adventures! Hopefully something will happen with Joe Morelli!...."
3,Formulaic,"I took ""Three"" and ""Four"" on a cruise expecting two treats. Instead what I got from this one was pure boredom. Perhaps it is inevitable that a series becomes a matter of filling in the blanks. In this case, what started out with a bang has become a predictable succession of events. Sure, many of these are humorous but we all know by now that Stephanie will endure her parents, Grandma will act strange, Joe will flirt and Lula will holler. The series needs a little ""oomph"" to keep going. The story was also not one of the best."
4,"Quirky, kinky characters...never-fail humor!!","Stephanie Plum, bounty hunter extraordinaire? Well, not exactly one of the top in her chosen profession, Stephanie Plum is in way over her Jersey hair! The neighborhood candy store owner, Uncle Mo, is a ""failure to appear"" in court on a concealed carry charge. When Stephanie goes to take him in, Uncle Mo is missing. Dead bodies however, seem to be springing up everywhere!! With it's quirky and kinky characters and it's never-fail humor Janet Evanovich has another terrific read to her many credits!!!"
4,I was going to stop at 1,"I bought # 1 while on vacation because I had a couple of friends that said they've enjoyed the series. I thought I'd buy 1, maybe 2 but I'm hooked. It's a fast read & keeps me coming back for more. If there's nothing I really have to do (or maybe just put off), I'm quickly reaching for this book."
5,Had me laughing out loud,"It is not often that I laugh out loud at a book but Stephanie Plum manages to do it every time. Love the stories, the humour and the sexual tension. Great read."
5,Three to Get Deadly,Evanovich has the most incredible way with words. You find yourself laughing out loud and tears running down your cheeks..........She's hilarious!
5,GRRRREAT!,"I bought ""Three Plums in One"" which is the first 3 novels all in one hardcover book and I read the entire thing in one weekend. My husband thought I'd lost my mind when he kept hearing me cracking up laughing while reading these stories. I just ordered all the rest and I know I'm going to be totally disappointed when I finish Seven Up and have to wait for number 8!"
2,Enough is enough,"It was in this book that I quit. Stephanie Plum, the protagonist, seems to be learning disabled, continuing to make the same sort of mistakes--and sometimes the same mistakes--over and over. Too much of the same thing, after reading the two earlier novels in the series."
4,Laughed 'til I cried,"I rarely laugh out loud while reading, but Stephanie Plum and her motley gang of friends always has me laughing until I cry.In book three Stephanie is after the neighborhood candy store owner, the beloved Uncle Mo. Everyone in town is mad at Stephanie for trying to bring Mo in on a FTA (failure to appear)The only support Stephanie is getting is from her friend ex hooker Lula, a wanna be bounty hunter in training.Steph's usual gang of friends and cohorts make appearances here, including Grandma Mazur, the mysterious Ranger and the sexy and dangerous Joe Morelli.As the body count rises, it is apparent that there is something a little strange about saintly Uncle Mo. And who are the guys in ski masks threatening Stephanie and her beloved hamster Rex? And why is Stephanies hair bright orange? The answers to all these questions and more will be answered, if only you can stop laughing long enough to finish reading!"
4,Need a great laugh??,"As always, Janet Evonavich delivers a great amount of amusement along with suspense and action. This is such a great series!"
5,Awesome,"What a great series! It's such a fun easy read, it's nice to just read and not think!! Very good book!! I would get them all!!"
2,I expected better,"Several people I know who read this author's books with enthusiasm recommended that I read one. I'm finding it's an effort to try to finish this book. I think the writing has some good qualities but is pretty heavy on quips, is pretty crude and tries too hard to be funny. I'm not so crazy about the characters either. I will complete reading this book to find out what happened to Mo but I'm not interested in going on any further adventures with Stephanie Plum or reading of her interactions with her family or associates. This isn't even a guilty pleasure read."
5,Will Stephanie Plum Capture the 'SAINTLY' MO?,"These books are so entertaining that they are almost impossible to lay down!In this third book of the Stephanie Plum series, a 'saintly' old candy store owner is on the run-and bounty hunter extraordinaire Stephanie Plum is on the case. There are many killings and as the body count keeps on rising,Stephanie finds herself dealing with these drug dealers and slippery fugitives. She is on the chase of her life to capture Mo. With the help of eccentric friends and family, Stephanie will have to solve this puzzle soon-to ensure that this case is not her last!"
3,Three to Get Deadly,I would have loved this one to NOT be abridged. Love Stephanie Plum. I am catching up on the early days and this one did not disappoint me.
4,not as good as the first two,"I love the stephanie plum novels, but i have to say, this book was not as exciting as the first two or as the ones that follow. It is still a good book and the condition i received it in was ok, me personally, as long as there arent any pages missing and the smell is ok, a book can come in any condition. I would recommend this book though but definitely read the others as well."
4,Laugh Out Loud Funny,"This one is quite laugh out loud funny. Rather embarrassing when you are listening in public. Lula may think that Ranger is a Super Hero, but I'll take Morelli any day.This time Stephanie is out to find ""Uncle Mo"" the well loved neighborhood candy seller. When the bodies of local drug dealers start turning up Mo is the main suspect. The book takes an interesting turn and it appears that Mo is up to a whole lot more than just selling candy."
4,Husband Reads,My husband reads all kinds of books and this one was a good book. Will try more of Janet Evanovich books soon.
5,just back and enjoy,"this is a great summer, winter, spring, fall book, it you wanna laugh and just enjoy this is the series for you"
5,I am LOVING this series!,"Someone at work turned me on to this Jersey-girl series, and I am LOVING it!! I can't wait to receive the next installment. A GREAT read!!"
5,another gold medal for Evanovich,Another quirky and entertaining read by Janet Evanovich. This wasn't the best one that I have read but it did have me laughing out loud a few times. I have to say that I missed the musings of grandma Mazer in this one as she was rarely in the picture and there were no funeral outings. I am looking forward to reading more Stephanie Plum in the future.
3,Third Time Through and Still Laughing,"Once again Janet Evonavich has delivered. As mentioned in my earlier reviews I turn to the Stephanie Plum serious to off set my more serious reading. Once again Three to Get Deadly delivers. As Stephanie Plum fumbles her way through tracking down an influential member of the ""burg"", I laughed out loud as she fought off ""concerned neighbors"" and Joe Morelli. Another simple, funny and enjoyable read. I am on to book 4."
5,Got to admit they're getting better.....,"The first two books in this series had me in stitches, but after I finished the third one, I realized that they just keep getting better. The same quirky characters are in volume three, and Evanovich developed some of my favorite ones right down to every funny detail. The capers in this book are more elaberate, laugh out loud funny, and keep you wanting more. Stephanie Plum's character is so strikingly like the everyday woman, and it is a joy to read of ""normal"" problems one would encounter as a ""bounty hunter"". Some of the scenes are unforgettable and have you rolling in your seat (Cluck in the Bucket, and freeway chase scenes to be exact). I can't wait to read the rest in the series and I hope Ms. Evanovich continues the Stephanie Plum series for a long while to come. Who couldn't relate to Stephanie's less than normal family members???!!!! A great novel, especially for the beach."
2,LACKING BELIEVABILITY,"I am currently reading Hot Six, and while I am enjoying that, as well as the other four, I have to say that Three to Get Deadly just didn't do it for me. The plot was completely unrealistic, predictable, and just not up to the calibar Janet Evanovich usually writes at. It had some laugh out loud portions, but overall not her best work."
1,This story goes nowhere,"What a waste of money and time to read this book. Unlike her former two books, the plot breaks down so often, just like Stephanie(main character)'s newly bought Nissan truck. The only time I laughed out loud was the description of the truck blow up into a fireball. That tells all about this novel--a total flop. The only thing I liked about this book is its cover."
3,Good - but getting old fast - Profanity doesn' t help,I read the first two books in the series laughing out loud. I couldn't wait for this one. But it got old fast. First - the profanity is rampant - I'm not a 'goody-two-shoes' - but the language really takes away from the book. It doesn't fit Stephanies character at all.I have to agree with many of the other reviewers - It isn't right that Stephanie NEVER learns. She doesn't take the job seriously - and risks her life over and over and over.... for no apparent reason. She's obviously smart - but the book never gives us a chance to see that. She is also obviously pretty - but has zero social life or other 'suitors' than Morelli.I'll probably read number 4 - but I hope to see a little better than this book.
3,Funny but raunchy,"Book 3 is definitely a lot street talk raunchy but very funny. Think you have to be an eastern inner city person to like it.I grew up by the BronxGrandma is a hoot, and"
3,Poor narration,"I love the Stephanie Plum books. I must say that I have listened to a lot of them on audio format narrated by Lorelei King. It was painful to listen to this version after Lorelei's. This is why I only give it three stars. Not for the plot but for the narration, the plot I would give 5 stars. Beware though this is abridged, which I didn't know when I purchased it. I recommend to skip this audio and read the book instead. The plot was fun and typical Stephanie Plum insanity ensues."
2,Not really impressed,"After enjoying the first two Stephanie Plum stories, I eagerly jumped into this one. It did not meet expectations. It was just not believable. Stephanie continues to make the kinds of mistakes that you would think she would learn from by now. And while I was able to laugh at the irreverence of the earlier books, I agree with others who said this book was a bit TOO crude. I am undecided as to whether to move onto the 4th."
3,Good Comedy - SoSo Drama,"Let's be honest. Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series is more comedy than crime thriller. It meanders along a story line until it finds a comfortable conclusion. Then you're done and it's time to move on to your next book. It's comfortable, entertaining reading, but don't expect to have a world rocking experience."
5,Stephanie Plum vs. Uncle Mo,"Stephanie Plum, bounty hunter extroardinaire is asked by her boss and cousin, Vinnie, to bring in Uncle Mo who runs a candy store in the Burg, an area of Trenton, NJ. Mo is an icon in the burg, and Stephanie feels bad about pursuing this kind old man. Imagine her surprise when she encounters protests from the reputable members of the neighborhood, as well as some disreputable ones. Soon dead bodies begin to turn up everywhere and it appears that Uncle Mo is in over his head. In this third book of the series, Stephanie has her usual battles with balky vehicles and her policeman friend Morelli. Her ex-streetwalker friend Lula becomes a bounty-hunter-in-training and she proves to be an hilarious sidekick for Stephanie. This is a funny, slickly-written mystery which will keep you laughing."
5,Plum addictive,"Warning! Potential addiction for Ranger & Joe Morelli. Personally, I think these books HAVE to be read in order. So, if you're reading Number 3, and you haven't read 1 & 2, back away! Janet Evanoovich is a masterful writer who knows to not ""end"" a book, but to tease the reader into the next one. My plan had been to read ""One for the Money"" prior to seeing the movie. After devouring the first and second books, I skipped the movie. Other than Debbie Reynolds as Grandma Mazur, the casting didn't fit what I thought it should. Just be careful reading these in public. It's hard to explain the fits of laughter!"
4,Good book,A good continuation to the second book. i think this one was easier to read and not as predictable as i thought.
3,poor grammar/writing style,"There were tons of typos, especially with replacing 'y' with 't' and not making new paragraphs when there is a new speaker. Other than those annoyances, it was a great story and I enjoy the series."
5,Three to get Deadly,Great book. So far all of her books in the Stephanie Plum series is great. I would recommend al of them.
4,Great Read!,"I loved this, the third installment in the Stephanie Plum series. After reading One For The Money I rushed out to get Two for the Dough and Three To Get Deadly. I love the character of Stephanie Plum. Janet Evanovich's writing is getting better with each book as well as her makeover pictures on the inside covers."
4,Violence can be Funny,"This particular adventure definately had more gunshots than the others - but I was laughing out loud in public places while reading this one. Stephanie Plum is an amusing heroine, all the more likeable because most women can relate to her. I haven't read the 4th book yet... and I may not be able to wait for the paperback. This series has become an addiction for me which I enjoy immensely."
4,Three To Get Deadly,"Three To Get Deadly is spectacular! You will definitely not be disappointed with the entire series of Stephanie Plum novels. The characters in this book are hilarious and her family is classic. Janet has impeccable comedic timing; she perks you up right when you need it. This book is fast paced and will keep you rapped around it's finger. Stephanie will seize to amaze you through out the book when she can't dig herself out of the deep hole that she has dug. This girl just can't keep herself out of trouble. It's like she goes searching for it. The book will also fool you; nothing is what it seems. Stephanie is very entertaining with her unpredictable antics and attitude. If you love books with passion and laughter, I highly recommend this book to you."
5,"How I gave ""Being me"" 5 stars.",Being Me is a great kid's book! I love being me! I got it from school. That's why I gave Being Me 5 stars!
5,Excellent CD,"Let me just say quickly that there are a lot of different versions of the Miserere out there and this is at least a very very good one. As an added bonus, it includes other tracks by Allegri (yes, that's right, he wrote more than just the Miserere) and its not just filler like the ""other"" works of some other one-hit-wonder type composers out there (I wont get into names but the initials of one are Pachelbel). The Missa Vidi Turbam is honestly deserving of your time and recognition. If you're confused as to why there appear to be two miserere's on the album its because the first includes added ornamentation in the upper register in the style in which the Miserere was originally perforemed. But don't worry if you're a fan of the more common high-C version, because it is included as well at the end of the CD."
3,Basic interview text,"Didn't get the job, but the book did help me a little during the multiple interviews. The better option is to call a rep and have a sit-down to go over the ins and outs. If you can't find one, go to your local pharmacy, they'll have contact info for you. Good luck!"
2,I guess OK,"The book I would say is good if you are willing go insanely above and beyond the normal realms of getting a job...most of the info. is pretty easy to figure out on your own, but if structure is needed this can be a good guideline. Over all it did not do much for me, but it might work wonders for others."
5,Great Christmas Song!,"She's done it again! already being cmpared to Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston, Christina Aguilera has produced another masterpiece to compliment her sucessful CD. A great song to keep you nice and warm this winter."
1,It is horrible!,"enough with Genie in a bottle and her version of Chestnuts roasting is clearly an attempt to be like mariah who is a ledgend and christina is a passing fad. nice try, its bad and i do not recommend it! in addition the cover is hard to look at we all know christina in notthe most attractive teeny bopper! Britney is soooo much betterr"
4,Great Holiday Import from The r/b diva.,"A Great Single for Christina Fans!1.) Chesnuts Roasting On An Open Fire (thunderpuss 2000 Holiday Remix*) - This is a classic remix which is also feat. as a bonus track which you will find on her x-mas album. It is much like a radio mix, and if your not sure what a radio mix is it is a remix which is about the same length of time as the original yet has a fast dance beat, and usually some cool effects thrown in.2.) Genie in a Bottle (eddit arroyo's smooth mix) -This is very cool, ultra-calm watered down version of genie in a bottle.This Cd is a great buy and worth every penny!! $$$"
5,Excellent reults,"I have used this product for the past 4 years, and have had very good results. When I first started these pills I could hardly walk, then as time went on (3 months)I could really feel the improvement.I have recently had a total knee replacement, and I feel this procedure was delayed by several years because I took the MSM with Glucosamine. I will have my other knee replaced as soon as the first one heals; until then I will be using this product for my second knee.I realize different people react differently to supplements, but I would really recommend trying these."
2,Loud!,"I had high hopes for this humidifier. It's great for anywhere but your bedroom. Even on the lowest setting, it is quite loud."
3,Very Disappointing!!,"It is not Dishwasher Safe! We purchased this because we wanted it to be easy and the dishwasher safe is why we bought 2 of them. The only thing that is dishwasher safe is the bottom tray. The filter is supposed to be permanent, but I'm guessing it will wear out fast, it is washable just not in dishwasher. The water tank seems like it is easy to crack, the plastic is thin and seems weak. We are very disappointed that it is not all dishwasher safe like the description says. It accomplishes what it is supposed to though."
1,Filter Run-Around,"I loved this humidifier the first season I used it. I cleaned the filter just like the owner's manual instructed and at the end of the season followed the instructions again and disposed of the filter. Fast forward to this year. I stopped at more than 10 stores looking for the filter, checked online through the company and outside sources, and still no filter. Called the company and you can't purchase another filter. How the heck is it billed as a permanent filter when they tell you to throw it out and replace it? And then you can't buy another filter without buying a complete humidifier unit? Ridiculous. And I can't even email the company's customer service department to complain because they don't have email!!! I'd give it 0 stars if I could."
1,Can't keep humidity in the comfortable range,"I am using the humidifier in a 12 x 10 room. It only gets the humdidity to 23% and that's on the highest setting (which is very very loud). I started out using the permanent filter and thought maybe it was the filter, so I replaced it with a regular filter. Results were the same. Very poor."
1,Disappointing,"I also purchased this thinking the permanent filter would be a great option. I followed the instructions exactly and the filter was still a mess after 3 months. After endless online and store searches, I now find the filter is not replaceable. What a waste of money and it was also noisy."
2,Arid in North Dakota,This humidifier started out fine but when I needed to replace the filter due to mineral build-up and mold I was unable to purchase one. Granted I didn't clean the filter as regularily as I should but I didn't expect it to be unavailable for purchase -- quite annoying!!!!
2,"Dated and unprovocative, except for Cadillacs and Mano Negro","This is not the place to start with Latin Rock. As the Rolling Stone quip says, Mexican New Wavers predominate - resulting in a dated form of crossover. That said, the New Wave influence sounds fine in contrast to the hard rock flavors on a couple of tracks. Rhino took care to assemble songs that give lyrical space to socio-political themes, but they did not present us with the cutting-edge in Spanish-language crossover music, EXCEPT for the tracks by Los Fabulosos Cadillacs (who will hopefully go back to this vibe after their last concept album) and Mano Negra. That leads to the real problem with this compilation: most of the best fusions being achieved in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries at this time are not based on 80s pop and rock styles. For all the attitude and energy of these bands, this disc fails to conquer."
5,Brand New Book,"The book I received was brand new and in exactly that condition--brand new. It was still in its original plastic, had the cd with it and everything. It came in an original Amazon box and I got it like 3 days after making the purchase. With quick shipping and a beautiful book with the cd, this seller did a great job!"
4,Stitching up my emptiness...,"I really liked this single. It was alot better than the Blue Monday one. Two of the tracks were still a little too dance-cluby for me, but I loved the rest of them. I thought the first track was even a little bit better than the original."
2,Graphic SF Reader,"Gave this another try, still didn't care for it, despite giant ape goodness.I am not sure why I didn't enjoy this a lot, as it should definitely be of interest, but the story didn't seem to grab me at all."
5,It really is EVERYTHING you need!,"I bought this book to help me along in planning my own wedding. Well, I ended up having a non-traditional wedding, and STILL used a ton of the information in the book. It had great ideas for the reception, shower, invitations, etc. etc.Not only did I find this book helpful, but I passed it along to a friend who is using it to help with her own wedding plans. And...she's already got someone lined up to give the book to when she's done with it! Great book, it really does have EVERYTHING you need to plan your wedding!!"
3,A little disappointed,"I was a little disappointed when I received my ring in the mail. In the picture provided above the sides look like they make a heart shape, or at least it looks like smooth, clean curved lines. The ring I got in the mail looks like the sides are smushed in and not clean curves. Other then that I like it. I just wished it looked like the picture."
2,Too Much Trouble!!,"I never bought a puzzle ring before, and I never will again. It was a pain to figure out and the website does NOT have a solution. The ring was already tarnished, especially in the spots where the rings overlap. If you take off the string (which you eventually will), the rings easily come apart when you take it off your finger (or when you need to polish the rings), which is very inconvenient b/c then you have to ""reassemble"" it again.I wasn't expecting this much trouble, and it would've helped if it came with instructions. I plan on returning this ring."
1,Bad buy,"I was very unhappy when I got my ring. It was extreamly tarnished and left black dust all over my hands. The picture makes it look shinny and clean and it is anything but. The metal it is made from is extreamly frail and is easily bent out of shape. Also, once apart, the ring never sits right again even though I have put it back together correctly."
1,seriusly.,"this ring is not sterling silver. its made out of this black type of rock? I don't even know, it's for my girlfriend so its a smaller size, not like other puzzle rings where they're bands of silver these are like each individual rings connected like a puzzle ring. I've searched the site that the receipt is marked for; silver insanity to no prevail of finding the ring on the site to look what they price it as. Out of all the things I have bought for the holidays this year this is what i was really looking forward to to have some mineral covered in silver makes this a straight lie to sell as ""sterling silver"" if planning on buying this for someone i say don't do it. I look at reviews and decided to buy this for all the positive reviews this ring has received but it sucks. This ring is honestly a piece of junk compared to some puzzle rings I've seen and I don't now the prices so i can't say it may good for the price but i would have rather spent the extra money."
5,really like this ring,This puzzle ring is alot of fun. The metal quality if surprising good. I am very sensitive to mercury or nickel in cheap metals. I have no problem wearing this ring for days at a time.
5,best tv show ever,I have loved watching this series on tv and now I can watch it all ay from the dvd player. Please buy all seasons like i did. All ten seasons are the best.
5,outstanding,i love csi miami and am very sad that is is not on the air any longer. i was very happy that this was at such a price and am glad to have the opportunity to have it to complete my seasons set
2,10th season dissapointed me...,"I have been a fan of all the CSI shows since they started, including CSI: Miami, but it seems CSI:M went down a different path. While I understand the exaggerations and over-dramatizations inherent in the shows, CSI:M had way too many ""I'm calling BS on that!"" moments. Also, actions of some of the characters at times, particularly Horatio, brought up serious doubts about their morality. Horatio letting the child molester in the theatre fall to his death was certainly not what you would expect of an honest police officer. And the scene where he and Tripp took a suspect out to a deserted area for a little street justice was just plain wrong. I bought the tenth season because I have the first nine, but I can tell you I will never watch it again nor recommend it to anybody."
5,CSI Miami Season 10,"Fantastic season, hated to see it end. One of the best to ever have been on tv. Show will be missed by millions."
2,All the fun is gone,"I've watched every season of CSI Miami, and this is the first one that I considered returning for a refund. Actually, I tried, but I'd just missed the Amazon return window. Quite simply, all the fun of the previous seasons is gone. Horatio, Callie, Delco, and the other characters are all fine, but the stories are dark and unworthy of the cast. They storylines center around child murder, torture, child abduction, brutality, and perversion of various sorts - definitely not the fun in the sun type of stories that were on previous seasons. I wish they would have finished this series with great season, but I'm sad to report that it went a different way. What a shame."
5,CSI MIAMI,Hate that this is the final season. I just loved this series. I have every season on DVD and am sad to see the last season
5,CSI Miami DVD set,Ordered this for my husband for Christmas loves it watched a DVD every weekend got it very quickly after ordering
3,End of an Era.,"The acting from the main character was great. Horatio didn't pull any punches this season. The season focused more on personal relationships, & the finale needed a whole lot more work very anti-climactic.. The show really could've used some better writers this year."
5,What's going on?,I hate the fact that my favorite show is now off the air. I really loved the way the cast works together to make it one of the best shows of all time.
1,Blurry picture quality -- had to return,"We have all the past seasons on DVD. They play well and are crystal clear. I purchased the 10th season as ""new"" from an Amazon vendor, but the video quality is horrible. Picture is not sharp and in some instances is downright blurry and pixelates. Thought maybe I got a bootleg, so I returned it. Vendor was excellent, apologizing and issuing me an immediate refund even before they received my return. Was going to try again and reorder from somewhere else, but now I see that someone else has also commented on the poor quality of Season 10's DVD release. Maybe any new copy I buy will be blurry. Not sure if I will re-buy until I know for sure."
2,Disappointing,"I enjoyed reading Ms. Frank's Reflections in the Nile both for it's story and the accuracy of the setting. Ancient Egypt was described in such detail I had to assume that Frank had done a great deal of research in the process of writing her book. Shortly before I purchased Shadows on the Aegean my younger sister succumbed to Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD). This awful disease is an important plot device in Shadows on the Aegean. However, Ms. Frank does not portray the disease accurately and I found that I could not get past that. I developed a strong interest in the characters while reading Reflections in the Nile, and while Ms. Frank continued their story in Shadows on the Aegean I could not muster an interest in their fate in this sequel."
5,Incredible journey!,"This is the kind of book that takes you completely to another world! Through the characters Chloe and Cheftu, you live exciting adventures. It has a well thought plot, I can't wait for the next one. By the way... beautiful ending!"
4,Not as good as the first,I enjoyed this book but not as much as I expected to. Suzanne Frank does a wonderful job writing in historical context. She has an interesting premise but it almost seems to run away from her. She just seemed a bit lost in the vastness of her concept. I did enjoy reading this but my expectations had been raised by the first and this could hardly help being a bit of a disapointment. Still can't wait to get my hands on the next one.
2,Very disappointing!,"Very confusing, a difficult read. Not at all up to the level of Reflections in the Nile. I found the characters confusing, and pretty far out. I probably will read the next one just to see what happens to Chloe and Cheftu, but if it isn't better than this one I'm all finished!!"
3,"Good content, Defrauding cover","I found this book extremely helpful in fulfilling my calling to be a Godly shelter between my children and all other human contact. I do recommend it to all other couples joined in one flesh who wish to raise their blessings for the LORD.My one critique is that this book is listed as being written by a woman alone, without the guidance or censorship of her headship. While I'm sure Mr. Maxwell had a hand in ensuring that his wife's written words were truly of the LORD, having a single female name on the cover indicates otherwise, and can be defrauding to upstanding Godly men who may be perusing this website in search of wholesome products.Perhaps ofSteve should leave the writing (and reading) to her ordained headship and focus on counting animal crackers."
3,"Good, But it really needs more advice on how to stifle your spirit","I appreciated the advice in this book so much that I have lent it out to all of my friends! Our husbands only let us have about 20 dollars in spending money per year so its hard to buy ourselves books. I bought the Maxwell's book at a used book store and we have all shared it!With Spiritual Joy I will lend it to more friends, if my husband/headship allows me to have any friends. I would love to purchase the ebook format, but I am only allowed online 5 minutes a day and I can't read that fast."
5,Very important read,"This book zoned in on a very important fact: before homeschooling, pray in earnest. Homeschooling can be tough, so going into it with the proper frame of mind, knowledge and realistic expectation will help tremendously. I highly recommend this book to any Christian parent who is seriously considering the homeschool route. The author has been on the same route for quite some time and generously passes her experience on to others. A very good, informative read."
5,Homeschooling with a Meek and Quiet Spirit- fantastic buy!,This book is amazing for any struggling homeschool family. This book is inspiring and so informative about homeschooling. I highly recommend this book!
5,Proof positive that Staind rocks hard.,"Before buying this album, I had heard all of the songs from it, and I must say that is was well worth the price of buying it. If you liked Dysfunction, you'll adore Tormented. The album seems to have the concept of a man who is lost in his own personal travesties, and leads to his suicide on the last track, and thus comes the hidden track, The Funeral, which is indeed, a funeral. There's the organ music, and a eulogy. If I had to shorten this review to three words, I would say: Worth every penny."
5,Well Worth The Money,Yes this CD may be expensive.. but seriously it is a rarity.. I was told there were only 50 of the originals actually made.. that's why the price would be that way. I've heard the CD once and yes it is worth hearing..
3,Only for the Fan's!!,"I think it's a good album , the sound is harder than the last albuns , i like the sound ! it's good but not the best. If you are a Staind fan you should listen if you are not forget ;) thank you"
2,Sorry...I don't like it...,"Personally, I like the other albums from Staind. I love ""Dysfunction"", I like ""Break the Cycle"", ""14 Shades..."" was tolerable, and I really enjoyed ""Chapter V"". However, even for a debut, ""Tormented"" just sounds inmmature. There's emotion, but I lost count on the how many times the ""f-word"" is not only mentioned on the album, but on each song alone. Then again, Fred Durst produced this band in the first place, so that probably had a lot to do with it. All in all, the album itself just flat out sucks."
1,Great Corgi toy - until the quality control went bad.,"The Air Kong Squeaker Donut is our Welsh Cardigan Corgi's favorite interactive toy. He prefers chasing his donut to chasing tennis balls and Frisbees. He typically waits for us to retrieve any tossed tennis balls he misses and he has trouble carrying back Frisbees due to his short legs. But he returns almost all donuts tossed to him (whether caught or not), which makes the play sessions as much fun for his human family members as it is for him.Update - January 2012Well, our last batch of 3 was just very bad. Each of them lasted 3 weeks. I put some photos up on the main page of the product. What used to be a very tough toy is now a joke. Sad, because my dog loves this toy. But I can not afford to buy a new one every three weeks. And this is playing for 20 minutes a day, being supervised, so my dog is just catching the donut and bringing it to me, not lying around chewing it.I contacted Kong, but no response."
3,Kong,I did not think this Kong toy was as strong as most Kong toys. The material on the outside is not good for dogs. My dog swallowed some of it and had a little trouble going potty. I have a 90 pound Pit and Kong toys are still the best I just won't buy any with that fabric covering anymore.
1,Squeaker gone in a half hour,"Kong is typically a great brand of durable dog toys. This particular toy however, did not hold up to my expectations. This was purchased for a year and a half old Vizsla with hopes that she could play with it for at least a few weeks before breaking through the barrier and removing the squeaker. She opened it for Christmas Eve and had the squeaker out before bed. I think we will be purchasing more Wubbas."
2,Kong not what it is cracked up to be,"Very disappointed, I thought Kong toys were supposed to be the best. My labrador destroyed the squeeker (which she actually loves) within 30 minutes of being given this toy. The very next to go is the fur on the outside, it didn't take long and wasn't hard for her to do. I gave it 2 stars because it did provide her some entertainment but this toy is not for avid chewers."
2,Found one better!,"This toy is okay, but I've found the Pet Buddies version to be more durable.Pet Buddies PB1907 Plushy Tube"
2,Not Kong Tough,"Since this is a Kong, I was hoping it would be a bit sturdier. My mid-sized mutt had this torn into pieces within just a few minutes of play. Cheap tennis balls last longer. Stick with the classic Kong toys if you have a chewer."
1,worthless,"Our Lab spent less than five minutes with this toy, and it was ruined. Squeaker quit when the ring leaked air, the yellow tennis ball fuzz pulls off, and this toy is useless. Kong rubber toys are great, but this one was absolute worthless."
4,great toy....but not indestructabled,"Been looking for a tough toy for my beagle-pit mix puppy (8 mo), he eats tennis balls.....this toy he had the squeaker out in less than 5 min, and the felt off within half an hour......but he still chews on it and plays with it. I thought it was dead at first - but he loves it - he just 'customized' it. good toy"
2,poor contruction,Our puppy chewed off the yellow exterior fabric the first week. The whistle was pulled out the second week. I should have read the previous reviews.
3,Lasted a few days,I have a catahoula and these are the toughest toys she has ever had but she still destroys them. This lasted 3 days.
4,For active and non-active dogs,"First of all, This is not a product for powerfull chewers.But if you use it under supervision and get your dog to interest in it and its sound, it'll become in your dog's favorite.My Border Collie used to loose all his tennis balls and he used to hide'em from me. This toy is allmost impossible to hide for it's color, it's size and shape. Also the squeaker seems to be resistent."
5,Lab favorite!,"I order one of these ever holiday season for my lab. He gets a couple of new toys every holiday just like my kids. He loves these donuts more than any other toy he has....and he has a lot of toys. The squeaker only lasts about 10 min., but thats OK, he loves the toy with or without a squeaker."
3,"Decent toy, like a tennis ball, not my dog's favorite - see the puppy play with it in the video review","Length:: 0:59 MinsDecent toy but not my dog's favorite.It is made like a tennis ball.See the puppy play with it in the video review for more info.Kind of hard to squeak for a smaller dog, too."
4,Great Job!!,"My grandaughter is so thrilled, she never guessed it wasnt brand new. It will be added to her collection and be loved forever!!"
2,The title is only half true,"Don't think of this as ""Atlas of the Pacific Islands."" It's more like ""Pacific Islanders' World Atlas."" It starts with a detailed focus on the island nations of the South Pacific, but then becomes an ordinary world atlas without much detail.The island section is very good, covering not only geography but also economics, culture, etc. The map variety ranges from island groups, to major islands, to major cities. Satellite images? Maybe 2 or 3 of them, nothing to write home about.The world section is so-so; you could get the same stuff in any dinky little world atlas, and pay less for it. Calling it comprehensive is like saying a globe has ""international coverage.""If you hunger for information on Pacific islands, you'll find good food in the first half of this book, and I do recommend it. However, the second half (world section) will be like day-old leftovers: edible, but not worth the money you spent."
4,I couldn't & didn't put this book away until finished,"These sisters will make you want to jump into the story yourself. I don't want to give the storylines away...a must read. This book was excellent; so excellent that I read it in about 3-4 hours. I will only say..... where can I find a brother like Samuel? Don't say the internet!!! If you are reading this, I hope you don't have a daughter like Ashley or a husband like Ron. The Ron brothers will fool you... so pay close attention to your man, ladies."
4,Couldn't put it down,"This book was given to me on the fly and once I opened it, I couldn't put it down. I read this in about two days. It is a good buy with plenty of drama and hot stuff!"
3,I only have one real problem with this book,The dialogue and art are great and Hush is a interesting story but this book is paper thin. When I sat down with this book I honestly couldn't believe how thin it was. DC could have easily have made Hush One Volume but they cheat you out of your money by spilling it into two parts. There's Absolute Hush which is $40 which should contain the full story and added bonuses but to be honest I haven't picked it up and I don't know if its worth the money so there's no real way to get around it. There's a really good Batman vs. Superman fight in this book and despite it being paper thin its not a bad book.
5,great batman collection,"Again, we have Jeph Loeb, one of the greatest contemporary comic book writers. And he shines when it comes to Batman. What can I say about volume one, other than it is great."
5,Very nice illustrations,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my son, who is a huge Batman fan. He really likes the book and says that the illustrations are great. He highly recommends this book to other Batman lovers."
4,"artwork is great, story is pretty good...","first off, this should have been collected in one volume. i can understand that they wanted to get it out in stores so they split it up, plus they can charge a couple of extra bucks...but it's been out for a while now so it should be in one volume.the story is pretty good, not incredibly great, i think loeb maybe went off on too many tangents trying to involve every single great batman villain or ally somehow into the story (plus the 'twist' ending is pretty obvious). but it's certainly not bad and worth reading. jim lee's art is great."
2,Just a good comic book,"The art of Lee is nice like all his work men strong, women hot. I can't deny that, however, his Joker is the worst I've ever seen. But the story, well... maybe it would be great in 1 or 2 issues, but not twelve!!!! I think is sucessfull because Loeb know how to write the last page of each issue to keep you waiting for the next, but in two or three years when people can get the book all together, it would be forgotten. Batman look sometimes like a cyborg, sometimes like a fool, sometimes like the bad guy, but never like the DETECTIVE that he is. If you want a really great Batman's story read anything that Frank Miller had wrote."
2,It's No Long Halloween,"Having really enjoyed Loeb's Long Halloween and Dark Victory Stories (as well as his work on Marvel's Yellow, Blue and Gray) I was looking forward to HUSH. What a letdown. Quite frankly, very hackneyed . I expected more. Slightly rescued by the great artwork of Jim Lee."
2,Not that Great,"No change or progress in Lee's art style. Unfortunately a lot of fanboys/girls as well as editors feel this is the style that should be used for superhero comics. Save your money and instead purchase Batman interpretations by Frank Miller, David Mazzuchelli, and Matt Wagner. Storywise, it was alright."
4,good stuff,"Good story, pacing, and artwork. I especially like the glossy page presentation, it fits the work nicely. I think the art and layout give the series a sort of blockbuster or epic feel that I enjoyed while reading. Great use of background characters, I think this series managed to do what the Clooney / Kilmer Batman movies could not--present a large and varied cast or rogues without giving them a cheap or campy feel. Don't forget Volume 2 as well."
1,A videod lecture,"This video is nothing more than a taped lecture. I was expecting something far more interactive and visual, but it is just the professor--albeit a good one--lecturing his students in the classroom."
3,"not bad at all, but I like some others better","I think the reviewer who wrote a long 3 star review in 1999 described the major strengths and weaknesses of this book: definitely more detailed than I expected, but insufficiently respectful of traditional interpretations. I think the Hertz Chumash and the Conservative Chumash (Etz Hayim) both strike a somewhat better balance between tradition and modern views.But I would like to point out one thing that this book does very well: Plaut goes out of his way to incorporate not just the views of today's commentators, but also views other than the most traditional Jewish views (at one extreme) and his own: for example, he uses 19th and early 20th century commentators more frequently than Etz Hayim, and (unlike Etz Hayim) occasionally takes passages from the Koran to show how the Muslim tradition addresses Torah laws and stories.On balance, I can't say this is my favorite Chumash- but nevertheless I am glad I spent a year using it."
5,What more can you say,Deadliest catch is awsome ! The dvds came very fast and undamaged they have a lot of replay value love it!
5,love this show!,"Seasons four and five of Deadliest Catch were the best. I am ""addicted""...but will dearly miss Captain Phil. This is one of the few shows on tv I can watch over and over again. If you love the show, you will love this DVD set."
5,Another great season of DC,"I am an avid fan of the show and I believe I have seen every episode made!Perhaps it would be nice to have some more extras on the DVDs, but overall, it is true to the awesome show it is."
5,Deadliest Catch: Season 4,These people have the toughest job in the world...putting their lives at risk every day. Fascinating to watch.
5,Love Season 4,I bought this for my husband. He's a huge fan & then I became one. This season is a great one! The price was great too.
2,Kinda corny,"Bought it for my husband- He didn't like it at all- he wouldn't even wath the whole thing. Now to be honest my husband is picky, but I watch everything and I couldn't really find much value in this. it didn't grab my attention enough for me to keep watching. maybe it was great, but I couldn't watch it long enough to find out"
2,not a serious reference work,"I purchased this tome in order to expand my knowledge of lesser known significant women throughout world history. But the book is more akin to a People Magazine's Annual list than an OED of women's history.The book gives short shrift to women from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Its primary focus is on late nineteenth and twentieth century women from the UK and United States. The significance of each woman's contribution to society has no correlation to the length of her entry. Supermodel Claudia Schiffer is devoted more attention than Harriet Tubman and Sandra Day O'Connor."
1,Pretty awful,"I got this book as a reference resource for my daughter, and quickly regretted it. This book is extremely watered down, and full of historical inaccuracies.It primarily gives a very ""politically correct"" version of history, and focuses more on celebrity profiles than actual history.For example, Helen Keller was one of the most significant female historical figures of the 20th century. But her profile was both brief (only 5 sentences) and inaccurate (omitting the most significant achievements of her life).This book is actually disempowering for women."
2,Disappointing,"I was excited to see this book but was ultimately not very pleased. This book spent way too much time on personal recollections of housing conditions from some of the participants and too little on stories of the consequences of the code-breaking. For example, the shootdown of Yamamoto is the title of a chapter but it is covered almost parenthetically in it. It is told entirely from the British perspective. The Americans may have been too secretive with their allies but some perspective from the US participants was needed."
3,Heavy On Detail,"If you want to know every last detail about breaking the Japanese codes, this is the book. If you are looking for a good story, the focus on detail makes the book a ponderous read.Breaking the Japanese codes during WWII is a fascinating topic and an incredible achievement. The ability to decipher Japanese messages was a key to the allies winning the war in the pacific. I was dissappointed that the author did not elaborate more in telling the story of how the information was used in different circumstances and the corresponding results.Was this a good read? Yes, I learned a lot that I did not know. However, when the amount of detail got too heavy, I would skim forward."
1,Too much fluff!,"I bought this book hoping to learn more about British cryptanalytic techniques or some new information concerning the British eforts in the Pacific Theater. I was very dissapointed! There is far too much personal fluff (who cares how a certain upper class twit dressed?) and not enough history. At times it also seems like the author expects the reader to somehow regret England's loss of its colonial influence in Asia. I suggest Frank B. Rowlett's ""The Story of Magic, Memoirs of an American Cryptologic Pioneer"" instead of this book for anyone interested in the details of WWII cryptology. While it only covers the American side, it offered much more information from a first hand perspective. Those who just want a light read should go for Simon Singh's ""The Code Book""."
5,What a fun fast paced read!,"I really like this story. I really liked Fiona MacEnroy's sense of humor and her cheerful disposition, especially considering her circumstances. Very funny and fast paced book, lots of action. The main characters Ewan and Fiona are a good match."
3,Where's the epilogue?,"Call me spoiled but at the end of books I read they all seem to have either an epilogue or the author has tied up most things within the book itself...I was a little put off when my kindle showed 90% complete, the story didn't feel completed but I had reached the end of the book... (the other 10% was a prefer for another story). What happened with her pregnancy? They stressed how the clan only made male not female kids...I figured this was leading to a surprise daughter but now I'll never know...The back and forth also of the leads loving each other from pretty much the beginning of THE ENTIRE book but didn't say anything due to being scared until close to the last page (again I'm thinking I have 10% of sweet talking WHA HOO!!) I've been disappointed in books before but this is the first time I felt cheated....(the storyline itself though was alright hence my 3 stars....)"
3,"Good, but not her best","I enjoyed reading this Romance novel and have enjoyed this series. However, I found that the last 200 pages or so were rather predictable and lacked character delemas that were anything but ordinary- (Fight for characters to admit they love eachother).I found the ending to be rushed. I feel it needed an epiloge to properly tie up loose ends and see the characters truely happy.After saying all of that, it still was an enjoyable read!"
1,NOT WHAT WAS ADVERTISED,"THE SELLER SHOWED A PICTURE OF ONE ITEM FOR SELL. YOU THEN RECEIVED SOME THING ELSE. I MADE A COMPLAINT WITH AMAZON.COM AND THE RETAILER REPLIED THAT THEY WOULD SEND OUT THE RIGHT ONE THE NEXT DAY. ORIGINAL ORDER DATE WAS 09-07-12, RECEIVED WRONG PRODUCT ON 09-18-12. I'M STILL WAITING ON THE RIGHT PRODUCT THAT WAS ADVERTISED."
3,"Green Bay Packers 11"" x 17"" Ultra Decal Set",Love the hold package thing how ever the big green bay sticker was not so green it was very dull and of course they also begain to not have the proper sticking produict to stay on the walls so I used a glue stick.
1,Bootleg Copy,Received item and apparently it was a bootleg copy and would not play on any system I own. It was a dvd that I was so looking forward to seeing. VERY disappointing that this happens.
2,Tim Hawkins - I'm no rock star,"While I have always enjoyed Tim Hawkins, I was disappointed in this one. I felt that some of it was inappropriate as I watched it the first time with my age 9, 11 & 13 year old grandsons, I realized I will be previewing future T.H. shows before the kids see them. We'll stick to Full Range of Motion and look for another comic we can feel confidant in."
3,I'm no rockstar - Tim Hawkins,"I really like Tim Hawkins as a clean family comedian. I was disappointed in this particular performance because he makes light of child abuse. I am with Alice Miller in her book ""For Your Own Good"" that child abuse will persist if we hear people say we deserved it. No child deserves physical punishment in any form. I think Tim's episode on needing a Nanny goes down the wrong road and is not funny but disturbing. Otherwise it made for some great laughs and we enjoyed it. I am only giving three stars because I think child abuse is a serious nature and should not be presented as lightly as he has."
5,The Funniest comedy video EVER!!!,Tim Hawkins is hilarious and squeaky clean. More proof of his talent!! I wish he would come to California. Me and LOTS of my friends would love to see him perform live!
5,Very funny,"I just love a comedian that is funny and does not have to talk dirty to sell it. First of all, Tim is a very talented musician. The musical comedy is hysterical. The rest of the material is just plain fun. I would love to give this as a gift to anyone and I would be confident that it would not offend. I just love it."
5,Tim Hawkins: I'm No Rockstar,"Another great Tim Hawkins DVD. New jokes and good clean fun. Not much more need be said. There is always Bill Cosby, Tim Allen, Steve Allen, Tom Arnold, George Carlin, Etc. George Carlin was a bit rough with comedy. Tim Allen is into slap stick. ETC. Sometimes it is good to have good clean comedy."
3,A little disappointed,"My husband and I were a little disappointed in ""I'm No Rockstar"" in that there were some slightly inappropriate & rude things in it that crossed over our line of what we find acceptable. We liked ""Full Range of Motion"" much better."
2,Heliopan UV filter Review,I have been looking for the best UV filter for my 20mm f1.7 lumix lens. When I have found this Heliopan expensive filter I thought it was a very good quality filter because it's high price and Germany made(also I have read Heliopan web).I was wrong. It produces LOTS OF FLARE with artifical and natural light. It doesn't have enough coating. My Marumi DHG Lens protector (13 USD) cheap filter work better than this Heliopan. I'm not US resident so thats why I can't return it.Thanks!
4,An engaging rogue with mordant views on academia and death.,"Harry Bishop, witty, charming, disdainful and iconoclastic, battles academic absurdities and crime with a deft, though booze-fogged touch. Wry dialogue, realistic characters and the twist at the end make this book worth reading. Too bad it's out of print. Would that Harry were more readily available."
5,you do not have to be a fan of wrestling to enjoy this amazing film!,I am a pleased owner of this two disc set and its an amazing documentary. I love documentaries and this is one of my all time favorite films. I don't want to get into a debate of wrestling and its sub plots but lets suffice to say this exposes much of the hype and behind the scenes politics. The back stabbing that went on during this period are legendary in wrestling circles and the actors/athletes that double crossed Brett Hart went on to make a fortune in the game which shows you how little honor has to do with anything anymore. The bonus disc on his brother Owen who tragically died in a poorly planned and ridiculously dangerous stunt in conjunction with another event could be of interest again to non wrestling fans. I can't recommend this highly enough truly a 5 star film.
5,Yum! Bret at his best. Wrestling politics at it's worse.,Highly recommended for ALL Bret Hart fans and ANY sports fan (not only wrestling). Fascinating behind the scenes politics of one of the world's oldest and most beloved sports venues. You'll be glad you watched.
3,Okay.,This documentary is awesome. Always has been. For ten years later though I thought they could have had more EXTRAS for the dvd. So if you have an old VCR still hooked up and have this baby on VHS you might save your money. If you were thinking of updating this to your DVD collection go on ahead but dont expect any good EXTRAS.It does come with the A&E; documentary of Owen Hart. But I had that on tape too somewhere here. The documentaries are both great. Lack of EXTRAS is my main complaint.
2,Like the Other Guy Said,Bret... king of the WWF... then being the egotistical maniac that he is... tries to win the title in Canada. A pretty good video. Bret still screwed Bret. Enough said.
2,Bret Hart is my hero....NOT!,"In the beginning, Bret is king in the WWF and all is good. He turns heel and is somewhat removed from the ""hero"" spotlight. He's ready to leave for a bigger contract to WCW(that turned out just perfect ,huh?), and refuses to lose his title because he is a selfish egomaniac. End of documentary, end of Bret's career."
3,Save money and Record it on TV,"Why would anyone want to buy this, unless you dont have cable or a tv, otherwise you can save money and record it. Bret Hart is my 2nd All-time Favorite Wrestler behind Hulk Hogan (only because he went to dubb-ya C Dubb-ya ) then after he left it was the Undertaker then The Rock. This was good but it just proves that Bret Hart is Greedy, take nothing away from his talent but...what if wrestler went on Strike. Imagine this a Wrestler Mania Fatal 8, Bret Hart vs Hulk Hogan vs Tazz vs RVD vs The Rock vs Stone Cold (if he didnt leave) vs Undertaker vs Triple H for the WWE Championship with Brock Lesnar as the Special Guest Referee. Bret Hart is probably the Best Wrestler of All-time based on Talent, Rock and Hogan are Hollywood."
4,Wrestling With Shadows,"I grew up watching Bret Hart wrestling and I recently finished his excellent book. This dvd is a good look into his career, circa 1997 before the infamous Montreal screw job. Lots of uncensored WWF footage and shows Hart with his family. The dvd is well worth the price and you can buy it on various wrestling sites, it includes a new dvd about Owen Hart but I didn't get that copy. If you ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes of the WWF/WWE, then this one is for you. A fitting sad ending where Hart is walking with his frail father, Stu, into the famous Hart house and tells us Hart is currently with wrestling with WCW. Wrestling with Shadows is worth the price of admission and also pick up a used copy of WWE's Confidential as well, because it's the only dvd (as you 9/3/09) that has the Hart-Michaels Survivor Series match."
5,a great movie!!,"this was a great movie from start to finish! it is a must have for any ""True"" wrestling fan. at fisrt i did not like bret heart all that much, but as the movie rolled on, i found myself starting to like him. i never knew about all the things that go on when the camras are ""off"", but know i know. this was just a really great video and you should buy it if you want to see a great ""MOVIE""!"
4,Guitar workshops are excellent,"Although not a fan of the swirling cameras and jump cuts in the DVD, the music is excellent. As a guitar player in a praise band, I found the guitar workshops very helpful. They show you how to play a few songs (3) and share what effects they use to get their sound. If you play in a praise band and want to get your tone closer to Hillsong, this DVD will definitely help (with a little practice of course!)"
4,Awesome!,I love this DVD and all of Hillsongs music is uplifting and great for home worship. I was disappointed that the words are not in the cover or on the DVD. The children's DVD's are awesome too and they have an option with words on the screen so my children can sing along and it is good for children's church too.
5,"Awesome, simply awesome!!!","Our family loves to worship along with all the Hillsong Cd's and DVD's. They have brought us through many challenging times in our walk with the Lord and have given us such encouragement. Prior to ""Mighty to Save"", our favorite CD/DVD, by far, was ""Blessed."" Honestly, it took us several listenings before ""Mighty to Save"" attached itself to our hearts. Now we can't keep it out of the car's CD player nor the DVD player. What an awesome night of worship that was--and it lives on as it transports those who listen before God's throne of grace and glory. We would recommend this album to any who enjoy passionate, heartfilled praise and worship. The production of the DVD is tasteful yet graphically exciting. Thank you Hillsong for producing another great product."
5,AWESOME worship!!,Awesome DVD. The live worship was awesome and a blessing! The 2nd DVD has great teaching resources on worship and playing the songs with guitar and other instruments.Highly recommended!
3,Just Average,Offers basic recipes that most cooks already know how to prepare from scratch. It might be good for beginning cooks.
1,Deceptive. I wouldn't give this simple book to anyone. I learned nothing. The recipes aren't worth the effort,"This was a waste of my money and time. This is the worst item I have ever gotten on amazon. I am African American and my shock at the lack of respect for the consumer from this author is immense. The recipes were repetitive and extremely small in number. Shame on anyone who buys it . You have been warned!!!I must reply to the comment. I appreciate it-sincerely. Being African American has nothing to do with it. The cover pictures a beautiful kind looking African American lady. The appearance leads one to deduce she has great skill-which is not the question or concern. The book is one I personally would never buy again-period. I did not learn anything from it. It was overpriced, and the amount of recipes were ridiculously small in number and repetitive. I own over 100 cookbooks and spoke from my personal perspective."
1,very disapointed,the reviews lured me into buying this book-reading it made me return it--the recipes mentioned on the book back cover are NOT in the book. It is not worth the 17$ it cost(that includes the shipping)- I will be more careful in the future about depending on the book reviews.
2,A Disappointment,"I must agree with the prior reviewer. I purchased this book expecting not only many more recipes than were provided, but I also found the recipes presented were not particularly helpful.This seems almost like an unfinished project rushed to print. In its totality it is closer to those 'theme' cookbooks you can find in tourist traps. It's certainly not worth the price!"
2,Not quite there yet...,"As one who cannot resist any cookbook reminiscent of a nostalgic trip back to Grandma's kitchen - any Grandma - and any ethnicity, I had to get this book. While there are plenty of the old-fashioned recipes you would expect, the complete lack of pictures is disappointing.The layout and style is of the fund raising type you find at your local church group or club, which is fine, but I'm spoiled enough these days by newer technologies to want pictures of the finished recipes."
2,Not scratch enough.,The book is misleading as a lot of the stuff she uses to make her food I don't consider to be scratch. I was disappointed in the book although some of it was good.
4,A wonderful spiritual resource for women (and I'm a man!),"What can a man offer about a book for women? Well, as a husband who does his fair share of cleaning and dishes and child-rearing I can tell you that not only has my wife benefitted from this book, but so have I.I have benefitted in that not only is my wife a more content mother because of the advice offered, but I am a better father.I'm better because she is more content, and I am better because the book's advice and prayers are beneficial to housewives and househusbands weary from the drudgery of daily housework.The author demonstrates that housework and childcare can be a path to holiness. Finding the spiritual and the sacredness in our everyday tasks can make us Saints.I highly recommend this book, for both housewives and their husbands. It is a short, easy read. The very practical and honest prayers at the end of the book are alone worth the price of the book."
2,it's ok,I didn't think that this book was as great as the reviews said it was. It's ok but I was disappointed that it didn't elaborate a little more and thought it could have been more informative.
2,Bad theory textbook,This book was used for my Harmony I and II class at Fullerton Community College which was the second and third course in music theory for music majors. I find this book to be very poorly written. IT does not go into to much detail in explaining concepts. The chapter in the book are very short although the reference back section is handy. It is written in a skeletal outline format and does a terrible job at defining new terms. The book is also worthless for self study. Students need the guidance of a professor or music pro to help them learn from the book unless the student is very bright. Most of the examples are written for keyboard which could be burdensome for non keyboard playing people even though I play the keyboard. Also the examples in the book are not good enough and not all of the examples are in four part choral style which is learnt in most college thoery classes.
2,I Don't Like This Book,"I don't like this book. Neither does my Professor. It's written like some old math book from the 50's or something. Or a law book. They don't say things plainly in this book. This subject, with all of it's rules and regulations, should be taught without trying to show off how difficult the wording can be made."
4,Very Helpful,I would recommend this book to all HR managers and those who write policies. When it comes to dress code you have to spell it out. This book helps you do that and help define what dress code is good for your environment. Its a great reference!
1,Beware this is a duplicate of Eric Clapton Masterpieces,"Buyer Beware, this DVD is exactly the same as the Collectors Special Edition of Eric Clapton Masterpieces 2 set DVDs. One of the discs in that set is also called the ""music in review"" which is the title of this DVD. The only difference in this DVD is that it has a book of press interviews and it is in English with subtitles in French, Italian, German, Spanish and Swedish. If I had known this I would not have purchased this.There is better footage and documented interviews than this. Don't waist your money."
4,Chevrolet Truck book,"I thought that this was a very good book that covers all years, good, bad, and yes, even ugly. The pictures were good and the text very informative. It even has a few pages about the Blazer. It talks a lot about the old trucks, but doesnt cover much about newer ones, which I thought should be covered a little more. I learned a lot from the book, like how Chevy outsold Ford for 30 years."
4,No Sugarcoating With this Book,"""It must be sooo much fuuuun to be a DJ!"" Being in radio, lines like this are common themes that I hear from non-radio people. And radio IS fun, except for the crummy pay, behind-the-scenes office politics (aka ""screwjobs""...losing promotions for simply not kissing enough backside, etc.), and lousy hours. Radio is not as glamorous as it seems from the outside, and Chris Weigant puts it all out there for you in his book, ""Careers as a Disc Jockey"". He warns the reader about all the stressful aspects of radio I have listed as well as the benefits, like the ""efficiency"" of modern-day radio automation. If you're thinking of getting into radio, read this before you make your decision. It is a business you need to be prepared for."
3,VERY MISLEADING AD,I ALSO THOUGHT BECAUSE OF THE PICTURE THAT I WAS ORDERING THE PUMP WHICH IS WHAT MY DAUGHTER NEEDED. THIS NEEDS TO BE EXPLAINED BETTER SO PEOPLE ARE NOT MISLEAD.
4,Great for Traveling,"I have the medela pump n style, and didn't want to carry it with me while traveling out of town so I used this hand pump and it was so convenient and easy to take on the plane and use while we were out and about during the day. The only thing its easier to use this if you have a pump bra since you have to use both hands to use the pistol."
2,unreasonable return policy and misleading advertisement picture,"The picture is misleading - the system DOES NOT include the electric mechanism for the pump which is featured prominently on the photo. I ended up buying two of the same manual item, because I already had the pump and just needed the electric motor. Returning the item was not allowed because of its 'personal nature'; however, this restriction only applies to opened boxes, and mine was unopened, and the factory seal was intact, making the product returnable elsewhere. HereI had to take the matter up with my credit card company. 100% unreturnable items are not a good option online, especially when there is a discrepancy between what is advertised and what you get, because you might be stuck with a product you did not intend to buy."
1,Kids are Crazy for Crazy Frog,The kids will love this up beat music CD that redoes popular songs using a fast workout style beat.
4,Perfect for kids parties! Or any shenanigans!!!,"OMG I spit all over my laptop when I heard ""Ice, Ice Baby""! Hysterical! A must have for dj's or anyone that does kids parties."
3,"Not ""Crazy"" Enough","My 10 year old son thought it needed more actual Crazy Frog singing. He really enjoys that annoying sound and he didn't think this tape had enough of it (however, he still listens to it daily)"
2,Not very helpful,"I got this book in a Kindle edition - and the Kindle isn't really the device to use for a quick reference. Some of the formatting on key sequences and so on aren't even laid out correctly with the multiple keys on different lines.In addition, the material in the book is much more OS9 than OS X. I really don't think help on updating from OS 8.6 to OS 9 is the kind of problem I expect to run into anytime soon.I read through it when I got it and didn't see anything really worthwhile. I haven't opened it since.I expect a lot more from O'Reilly books than I got from this one."
3,Not what I hoped for,I like Carlene Carter but did not like the music she was doing at the time of taping this. Her band is good and her singing is good. dissapointed in the instance of vulgarity. Wish I could find a DVD of her Austin City Limits appearence or some of the other concerts she did in the USA.Deborah
4,great historically and musically,"The first few segments are outdated and interesting only from an historical perspective. Don't let this deter you. The rest of the segments are fabulous. The musical numbers really swing. With the animation you can ""see"" the music. The work here shows great development when compared to the earlier sequences. You will not see these on TV. Political correctness will prevent that. I do not believe any of what is shown is meant to be hurtful although some may interpret it that way."
4,"""That Dance Artist you Can't Remember or ever Forget""","For those who remember the days of Studio 54, and rapid fire dance mixes, there are a few memeories on this CD!!. ""I Should Have Loved Ya!"", Tonight I'm Alright"", ""I Don't Want Nobody Else"" bring back many memories for me. Although they did not receive much radio air play, these songs lit up the dance floors of many disco's. They are just a piece of memorabilia to add to any collection. Also, the rest of the CD is quite good!!!!"
4,A BIT DARK,"Looking for a good ""hot pink"" copy paper. The Pulsar Pink looked too pastel and Plasma Pink looked too dark red.Fireball Fuchsia is definitely ""hot"", but a bit on the dark side for copier use. Good but not quite what I was looking for. Picture of product on Amazon looks pretty true to color."
1,THE WORST ONE ON THE MARKET,THIS IS GOT TO BE THE WORST DESIGH OF A HUMIDIFIER ON THE MARKET. FILLING IT IS BY FAR THE BIGGEST PROBLEM OTHER THAN TRYING TO FIND A REPLACEMENT TANK. I'M TRYING TO ORDER MY 3RD ONE AND NO ONE SEEMS TO HAVE ANY. HMMMM! I WONDER WHY......
1,Not the Best,"It seemed like this product was never able to get enough humidity in the room and was always running. Also, it isn't the best to fill. Your only option is the bathtub and when I went to fill it and tried to stand it under the faucet it slipped and cracked. I can't find a replacement reservoir and now the whole thing is is worthless. On a positive not it looks good!"
3,Works well despite design flaws,"I have two complaints about the unit. The reservoir IS very awkward to fill and after a week I dropped it in the kitchen sink and cracked it. Fortunately the crack was superficial and it did not cause the reservoir to leak. Your best bet is to bear hug the thing as you fill it and hope you don't get water all over yourself in the process.The second complaint is the hygrometer that displays the relative humidity. The hygrometer measures substantially lower while the unit is running then when the unit is not running. As such, when the unit finally reaches your desired humidity it will shut off as it should. But then because the humidity shoots up, it won't turn on again for quite a while. I have witnessed a 10% difference between the humidity reported when the unit is running and when it is not. Obviously there is a flaw in the placement of the hygrometer.Since I use the humidifier intermittently I don't consider either of these issues major, hence 3 stars."
5,This is an excellent book for people wanting to get into sql,"I just finished reading Wrox - Beginning SQL 2000 Server, and thought to myself ' Gee thats great now what can I do with it.' I think books that teach your vendow specific SQL solutions take for granted that you allready know how to write the quieries. However I went out and picked up the Teach yourself SQL in 10 minutes book and it is really really good. At explaining the syntax that you will need to know before tackling those big fat DBMS books.So (if you are a SQL beginner)I would say before you go out there and pick up a big fat DBMS specific book get this book and use it to familiarize yourself with how to actually write the queiries. you will still need the big fat book later on but it makes alot more sense after reading this 10 minute book.Good job Ben Forta"
4,"Good book, but pay attention...","This book is very helpful for me, it's really straight and simple, but there is one thing you should pay attention to. Before I read this book, I've already read several book about ColdFusion, and use cfml to play around with the database. This book doesn't specify any actual language to assist you(like ASP, PHP, or ColdFusion), just focus on the pure SQL, that means you are supposed to being already dealing with one type of database and know one programming language like ASP, PHP or whatever. Otherwise, it's a little bit difficult for you to follow the example in the book to practise.(but you can just read it without practice, still very helpful)Most of all, each chapter is only 5-6 pages, and tell things very clear. I LOVE IT!!!! Hope every programming book is short like that."
5,As simple as it sounds,"This is a thin reference book, actually. The name is somewhat misleading in that there are no exercises generally associated with ""Teach yourself X in Y time"" type books. Although I don't work extensively with databases, it's a good reference book to recall how to structure queries in a manner that's simple and straightforward."
5,A+ for Students,If you're a student taking any type SQL course then get this book. Super handy and a quick reference. Gives some of the differences in MS Access and Oracle when using the same type of command because they can and do differ sometimes. Get it if you're not an SQL guru. I'm not either. You won't regret it.
5,An excellent book written for a target audience.,"Yet another well-written book by Ben Forta. This has got to be the smallest SQL book in existence. This is what makes it so great. I purchased this book for a handful of the more advanced users in my office. It allowed them to learn some basic SQL and bypass the very regimented structure of our report writer (Cognos Impromptu).This books carried them through SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING and then went into joins. Along the way it briefly touched on a few of the text formatting and numeric functions. The ability to confront such a potentially overwhelming topic (SQL) with such a small book is refreshing.If you are looking for a book to set you on your path to database administration or design, this one will not get you very far. You will likely be better served by the typical doorstop book."
4,Useful and accessible with an irritating flaw,"This is a handy, inexpensive memory-jogger for those of us who can't seem to recall everything we need to know about using SQL. The format is more accessible than the small type and monotonous layout of the otherwise excellent O'Reilly books.I have two suggestions for a third edition. I wish the author had explained how to use INSERT with composite datatypes. And by the third edition, I hope the editors rethink the idea that DBMS' forms the plural of DBMS. It's jarring to find a systematic error in a reference book."
4,Great Beach Read,"Contrary to popular opinion, I thought this was a great book. I love 'armchair travel' books, and I enjoyed the fictional story this plot wrapped around as opposed to a nonfiction traveler's journal. I have backpacked around Europe and this book was reminiscent of my early twenties, where your whole life is ahead of you and you're not sure what direction you want to take. It hit home for me the way the main character imagines a life of her own in each place she visits with her friends. It spoke to my inner desire to leave it all, travel the world and start all over again. I give it four stars because I didn't like the ending - pretty much from the time her boyfriend shows up it went downhill for me."
3,Summer beach book,If you are looking for a easy breezy summer beach book to read then look no further. This book is about three girlfriends who have lost some of their friendship due to college and other issues.Casey the main character of the book is going through a really hard time because she is trying to figure out what she should do with her life. Sin (Lindsey) is really upset with Casey for not keeping in touch and Kat is just looking for a good time with any guy she meets.
3,So-So,"Three friends - Casey, Lindsay (aka Sin), and Kat - take a month to tour through Rome and Greece before returning home to face their new jobs and `adult' lives. That is the basic premise of this book. The book is well written, and is enjoyable mainly because Rome and Greece are well described. The scenery is the best part of the book, and I felt like I was on a European whirlwind tour with a bunch of 18 year olds. The problem is that the characters are not 18 - they are upper 20s women who act 18 a majority of the time. Although the author tells us that the three are best friends, they spend the entire book belittling each other and ostracizing Casey. Also, Casey, the lead character, is terribly boring - I didn't believe for an instant that she was ever exciting and carefree (as we are told she was), and the end certainly didn't fit with the picture we had of her character. This book is marginal - high marks for setting and descriptions, but low marks for character strength and consistency."
5,Simply fabulous!!,"I loved, loved, loved this book. I am a big fan of travel and I totally felt like I was in a different place with this book. I am now making plans to travel to Greece to see if I can experience some of what these girls went through. I definitely recommend this book if you need a vacation but don't have the time or money to travel right now!"
1,Possibly the worst book ever,"Normally, I am a big fan of Red Dress Ink chick-lit books. This was a huge disappointment.The concept was cute (last-hurrah holiday prompts overworked law student to contemplate life - if only someone else had written it!) but the characters were never really developed, the progression of the story was predictable... which happens in a lot of chick lit, but this lacked any clever dialogue or anything to make up for it.If you need a travel chick lit book, go for Backpack, Wanderlust, or Bridget Jones the Edge of Reason over this one."
2,"Beware, Re-records May Be Present","The following note is provided inside the liner notes: ""For the benefit of the listener this product may have been compiled from a variety of sources, including where thought appropriate, live material. Due to the age of some master tapes, tape hiss may be audible. Where this is an unacceptable level tracks may have been replaced by re-recordings by the original artist.""I think they should have been able to edit out the hiss, but maybe not in 2001. I can remove a lot of it with my little home program."
4,Beautiful Coffee Table Book,"Truly beautiful book with many terrific photos. It is worth owning just for the pictures. I did not read his earlier now out of print bonefishing book, but imagine most of the technique section is a repeat. After a while, all of these fishing books are the same. You can only describe fishing for bones to a certain level, then you just have to go do it! The travel section was extremely thorough, although one might assume it is a plug for Kaufmann travel."
2,Disappointing,"Ordered this book with high anticipation. Had heard marvelous things about the content. Granted, it's beautiful with gorgeous pictures and some great technique descriptions. Perhaps my expectations were too high but considering the size and cost, I would expect this book to be fairly encyclopedic. But when you need to resort to another book for fly patterns/tying and leader construction, I think that is reasonable cause for disappointment. Given those are some basic areas to cover in considerable detail, the cover of the book is much more enticing than the viscera."
5,Fabulucious!!!,"Luscious - The Bellydance Workout for Beginners is absolutely fabulous. I do not catch on to dance combinations very well at all but after a couple of times, I was able to anticipate the moves. It's also fun to just get into the moves ""without watching"" the instructors.I love it because it combines learning a new workout while also learning about an ephemeral art (dancing). The only drawback is that the workout is 45 minutes and I would prefer 20 minute ""mini workouts"" but that can be remedied nicely by simply stopping the DVD after 20 minutes because you learn a series of movements a la workshop.I highly recommend it if you want something different for a routine."
3,confusing,"It was fun, but it isn't good for beginners. The instructions for the steps weren't very clear."
5,Very Enjoyable,"I found this DVD to be very enjoyable. The instruction portion is veryclear, the costumes are intriguing, and the dancers are lovely. This is a great beginners DVD. I'm not a beginner, but after surgery was advisedto ease back into it. This is easing me back into it and I'm loving it!I like that you can choose to work out with verbal cues or just music. The pants that the dancers wear are so cool, I think I will have to make a pair!"
3,Weird Soundtrack,"I have been bellydancing for almost ten years. From that perspective, this is a great addition to my video collection. It really breaks down the moves, but as many have stated, it is NOT for beginners. My main complaint is that the DVD refused to play on my machine. The company I bought it from was very gracious and sent me a replacement, which also had issues. Because it did play on my newly purchased laptop, I decided to just keep the replacement tape. However, and this is really weird, there was a point in the tape where there was the strangest talking going on, almost like something out of The Exorcist. I'm hoping this was just a result of my aging DVD player. I am getting the heads cleaned and hope I never hear this again. However, since both my husband and I heard it, it was not just a product of my imagination,"
2,Poor quality,"The video and audio quality are terrible, but since I didn't get a chance to use the video right away, it was too late to return it by the time I did. Also, their costumes make it impossible to really see their legs and feet, which I think makes it more difficult to learn than it otherwise would be. It is a decent workout though, which is why it got two stars instead of just one."
2,Not for beginners,"I bought this hoping to learn from beginner level on up. This has you moving your hips one way and your arms in the opposite directions, and all moving too fast. Definitely not for beginners."
5,Learn Bellydance,"This is definitely more like learning dance than it is like an exercise workout. And who needs those boring exercise workouts? With this, you learn dance moves that you can incorporate and use however you please. It's not so much a workout as it is dance practice and drills. But it's presented very well, so that while you're getting the repetitions, you still look and feel like you're dancing. Great choreography, on the whole. Get it to add to your bellydance collection. And if you're looking for a more complete bellydance DVD for beginners, get Love Potion."
5,Belly Dancing for beginners,Luscious-The Bellydance Workout for Beginners. I really love this DVD product. It is fun to practice the dance steps. It is also a great reason to throw a bellydancing party. What a neat theme to have a party and get a great workout at the same time!!! YAHOO!!! Now this is my idea of having fun with your friends and hopefully make new friends while your at it.
3,"good for beginnners, but...","It really is for beginners. If you have taken any classes, or have any experience with belly dance exercise - you will be bored....The movements are carefully shown, and it is slow - just right for a beginner."
5,Love it,"Plenty of other reviews here - but I just want to join the chorus. I'm not really a beginner but it's a great easy workout for a saturday morning. Lovely to watch, with costumes and staging. I like the onscreen directions, I like the option to play without voice-over, I like the breakdown section, I like that they swap over, I like that it moves at the right pace for me when I'm tired and stiff. The only small quibble is with Neon who can't seem to isolate her hips when shimmy'ing in some of the sections - but she doesn't lead those parts and she is beautiful to watch nevertheless. I think I would have to buy Blanca's sensual bellydance after watching her here, I think she is fantastic. Definitely worth the small price, which is only the cost of a lesson in any case! I would a love a series of 30-40min workouts like this."
3,Not for beginners.,"The dancers are beautiful. The costumes are beautiful. The instruction sucks. This is NOT a video for complete beginners, like myself. I found myself extremely frustrated by the speed of the instructions and the rapid movement from step to step.The instructors are all wearing long skirts and you cannot see the knee and leg movements they are pointing out to you. It is difficult to copy a movement that you cannot see.Do not buy this video until you have a firm foundation in bellydance. I'm sure its great for intermediates or advanced."
4,A good look at an amazing illustrator,I enjoyed this book. I had to wait until it was reprinted to get a good look at it.Anyone interested infine illustration and especially pen and ink work will surely be amazed by these works.The only drawback is that it only covers his black and white work and is therefore incomplete.
5,Painter with a Pen Review,"Arguably the best pen & ink artist ever. Some of his techniques resemble scratchboard. A wide variety of subject matter is depicted from landscapes, cityscapes, cars and people."
5,shipping,I didn't expect my book can be shipped in such a short time!!it's nice to receive the book in such a good condition too. I will definitely continue to purchase in Amazon if necessary.
4,Great French House.,Great French House and a album cover you can ignore. What more can I say. French make great house music. Get on board.
4,Good Sunday Reading,All the kids were gone and I decided to grab a book and read. Well this is the perfect book for just relaxing and enjoying. The stories were so real that they just took me back to where he was.
3,interesting,"Humans have the amazing ability to make any experience mean whatever we want to us. Wether or not an experience is positive or negative, real or imagined, is almost irrelevant to how we perceive that experience. In the book ""When We Were Colored"", the author proves this assertion. Despite a plethora of dehumanizing situations and experiences, Clifton Taulbert still manages to paint his childhood as a beautiful succession of events teaching him how to reach his dreams and succeed. That his upbringing served him well and Mr. Taulbert succeeded is clear. However, what is not discussed, but is painfully evident, is the real reason for his success. Although Mr. Taulbert's childhood gave him the tools he needed to succeed in life, the main way that it did so was by instructing him in how to be a ""good Negroe"", also referred to as an ""Uncle Tom."""
2,Not a Restoration!,"First of all, against another person's review about this DVD, Alpha did no restoration whatsoever. It is a copy of a DVD release from Grapevine Video and Alpha simply created their own generic title screen and superimposed their own logo in the corner of the screen. For those who have bought or watched this movie, I'd like to state that from the beginning. No restoration was done. Alpha hired someone to compose a music score, that's all. The film has been ""altered"" from the Grapevine Video release and doesn't even have the original title screen. Probably Alpha's way of branding the film so others cannot copy it. Secondly, it's NOT a horror movie. It's a drama that takes place in ancient Egypt. So if you are expecting a rare horror movie, forget it. Of course, Alpha alters almost all of the movies they release on DVD, superimposing logos in the corner, adding sound effects to the sound track of talking pictures, etc. You'd do better buying the Grapevine Video release on Amazon.com."
1,Disappointing,I am very disappointed with this cd. I hate when record companies want to make more money by putting out compilation cd's everytime an artist hasn't put out new material. What a waste this is!
3,Some redeeming features......,"I read The Beach House last summer and loved it. This book, however, is much less engaging. The characters, with the exception of Lijah, are dull and formulaic. While some facts about raptors were interesting, overall, the use of that device did not capture my attention as did the use of sea turtles in Beach House. The author did, however, do an excellent job of describing Type 1 diabetes and its management in young children."
1,Book for raptor lovers only,"Wanted to like this book because I love Mary Alice Monroe. So, I kept reading a page a time, put the book down, read another page later. If you want to know everything about raptors, go for it, you'll love it. Everthing else about the book, relationships, fell flat. I did not finish it."
2,The cover is far more captivating,"When I first glimpsed the cover, I expected an engrossing story with captivating characters as Monroe previously mastered in The Beach House. I felt the plot was cliche and the characters two-dimensional, with the exception of Lijah and Santee (bird of prey). The birds of prey subplot could have been more developed and engaging. Overall, the book is an interesting weekend read, but falls flat when compared to The Beach House."
3,ho hum,"I learned a great deal about raptors and the area in which the book was set. The secondary characters were a joy; however, I developed no empathy for the main characters.The entire time I read it,I didn't care whether the two protagonists got together or not.The other characters and the birds made it worth reading, but it could have been better."
4,Good Book!!,"I have not read a book by Mary Alice Monroe that I didn't like! This one tells a lot about Birds of Prey, and how a refuge is actually run. It has a very likeable main character. I truly enjoyed the story line - and could relate to it."
5,skyward,I have a friend who is a birder and I wanted to get a copy of the book Skyward for a present. It was very easy and simple to order from Amazon.
5,Monroe will capture your heart,"I recommend this book to everyone and anyone. After reading her last book The Beach House, I beacame much more aware with the status of our beloved sea turtles. Now after reading Skyward, I have a new appreciation for the birds of prey. Monroe skillfully intertwines the power and beauty of natural elements into her stories. Her novel was so captivating that I didn't even realize how I had come to better understand the low-country area that I'm from. Reading this novel will make you feel like a better person just for reading it. No matter where you are from, this novel will leave you speaking with a Southern drawl. I absolutely loved it."
4,Jane Eyre + raptors,"I am ambivalent about this book--it kept me enthralled throughout and I came to really care about the characters. But when I got near the end and realized that Monroe had simply modernized the plot of ""Jane Eyre"" (complete with plain governess, single-father-and-daughter, final destructive fire...), I felt completely ripped-off. Chapters are woven together through the vehicle of different raptors being rescued and (hopefully) returned to the wild (hence the title).Great characterization and description. Realistic dialogue. A good read!"
5,very simple review,"If you are a fan of Mr. Walker - you'll love it. If you are not -you will acquire a new obsession...and we all like new obsessions, don't we? GO FOR IT!"
1,Not correct....,"This listing for this item is incorrect. There are only about 13 songs on each CD. I bought it for the song ""Look at Them Beans"". It was not included. I returned it to Amazon for a reported ""bad batch"". The replacement CD was exactly the same as the first."
1,False advertising,"I also bought this CD for the songs of ""A Boy Named Sue"", ""Boa Constrictor"" and others. However the lists say that disk two has 22 songs. It DOES NOT. There are only 12 AND none of the songs I wanted are on this. I am very upset with Amazon and the manufacturer of the CD for giving/allowing this mis-representation in order to sell a CD. Please refer to the other feedback review. It lists exactly what is on this CD."
2,Excellent soundtrack...terrible version,This version really dissapointed. Ornella is wonderful but the lack of coherent editing and the horrendous English dubbing makes you wonder if it's worth 90 minutes of your life. Would like to know where to find the original Italian and the soundtrack which brings back memories of my childhood.
2,Cheap,"When the item arrived I was especially disappointed by the ""belt buckle"" which is manufactured with some sort of weird styrofoam material. Also, the dress ties in the back. Overall, it's pretty cheap-looking & flimsy, though, what can you expect for the price?"
5,Kept the whole family rivited,"This DVD I brought for myself thinking probably a movie just myself would enjoy.... Cable vision went out so I put it on... well my family Husband, myself 14 yr old 18yr old and her boyfriend sat and watched the whole thing..... it kept you thinking and a twist at the end..... well maybe not a twist but not what any of us expected.... the girls all were teary eyed at end....Its a movie about life being meaningful and about forgiveness.... guess the bad reviews like more gory films... this is definately not that but definately worth watching...."
4,Wonderful MOVIE,"Movie was in great shape just wish it had come with a case. I read the book and then had to see the movie, like in most cases the book is better but the movie is still great!"
3,"Not the book, but still good","I just loved the book version of this product, so I couldn't resist seeing what the movie was like. As par the norm for me, I enjoyed the book more, but I thought they did a good job with tranferring this story from paper to film. I appreciate that this is a good, clean movie (with the exception of some swearing), and gives you something to think about. It will give you cause to consider how everyone you come in contact with, and sometimes even those you don't, affect your life. Sometimes its small, but othertimes the entire course of your life may be altered. This movie may not have been filmed on the same scale as a major Hollywood production, but I think it was well done and deserves to be watched..."
4,A Perfect Companion for the Book,"Since I am having my students (at a local two year college) read the book, ""The Five People You Meet in Heaven"", I thought it'd be a nifty idea to watch the movie when we finish with the book. I found it on Amazon. My students are looking forward to seeing the movie. They are loving the book. The movie faithfully follows the book - which I like. The prisoner-of-war chapter in the book and scene in the movie are incredibly powerful. I think the movie was perfectly cast: Jon Voight is perfect as Eddie. I recommend that everyone read the book first, then order the movie."
4,Nice Movie,"Its a good movie that teaches about life & death.A good buy! But like most movies taken from the book, it can't beat the book."
2,the book is a lot better,"i had high expectation on the video but it turned out to be quite disappointed and boring, i have to say that the one is one of my favourite books i ever read"
3,"Warm fuzzies, but terrible DVD quality","Yes, there is some comfort in 'feel good' philosophies but nothing is gained by being given someone else's answers to life. A nice movie that attempts to supply pat 'answers' instead of challenging the viewer to explore possibilities beyond the usual paradigms.Lastly, the DVD is not worth purchasing for one glaring defect... the sound. The narration is inaudible compared to the sound effects, the dialog needs to be cranked up while we are blasted out of our chairs when there is a scene depicting any action.Hopefully this movie will bring an end to movies that offer no real answers to the conumdrums of being a thinking human. I shudder to think of the upcoming 'end of times' and 'revelations' movies. People deserve better."
2,"Good Acting, Bad Story Telling.","I honestly do not understand why people love this movie so much. The story is a decent idea and on the original side but the execution of that story is very weak. The movie drags on and on forever and loses its momentum aftr the second person the main character meets in heaven. The movie is only 2 hours long but feels like it takes a month to watch. john Voight does a great job acting but i just feel the story telling was weak. The whole movie has a vibe like ""Big Fish."" I am not going to say the movie was the worst ever but I do think it is signifigantly overrated."
2,HEAVEN CAN WAIT (2 1/2 STARS),"If this is what heaven is like, I hope I never die! Some of thismovie was decent, but most of it was dragged out and boring.Why wasn't this movie in widescreen? You have to turn yourcenter speaker way up too. This movie was a good idea, but waspoorly executed."
2,Yawn! You can skip this one.,I don't know what I expected but by the end of the movie I could have cared less who the five people were. The movie was slow and plodding.
5,Watch This Movie! It's Great!,"I bought this movie but I have not watched it yet.I have been told that it is a really good movie,and I saw some scenes of it one day when it came on tv.That is what unctioned me to buy it.However I did not watch it on tv,as to the fact that I was quite busy that day.I am basing my review on other people's comments that it is a good movie to see.I only gave it 3 stars because I haven't seen it yet.UPDATE! I have watched this movie and it was great! Jon Vight did a great job in this and the storyline was really touching. I will watch this again!"
3,A bit dissappointed,"The book has left me with many imaginations; however, the movie was made in a less drastic way. It did, however poorly, tell the story, but the fantasies were somehow 'lost in translation'. The casts were not very convincing, handsome and beautiful as they are. Ruby pier doesn't appear to be a lovely place to be in the movie."
3,Movie's great! Much dialogue is inaudible! No captions!,"I had seen this film years before and really loved it. It left such an impression on me that I recently bought several copies to give away as gifts to elderly friends. While the specifications and the package say the film has ""closed captions"" they can't be selected from the menu; there is no ""closed caption"" option. Perhaps some TVs will show them anyway, but my Sony LCD didn't. To make matters worse, much of the dialogue is inaudible, over background noise. Naturally, I was extremely disappointed with this defect and I returned all DVDs. Amazon was kind enough to refund all of my money. If this problem were ever to be resolved, I would order multiple copies in a heartbeat. Thanks for reading."
4,another read the book instead,"Once again my huband purchased this book for me as well and it is such a magical and touching story. I bought the movie the same time I bought the Tuesday;s with Morrie DVD thinking the same thing that if I loved the book and the story so much, I would like the movie. The movie did bring some things in book to life, but while I was reading the book I could come up with images better than I think the movie did. Once again I would save your money and just read this great book instead of watching the movie that doesn't give the book credit"
5,Great,This is an awesome film for those who love stories that invoke thought. The meek in mind will probably not get the meaning of this film. John Voit should have at least been nomonated for best actor for this.
4,5 people You Meet in Heaven,"This is a very good movie. I shared it with friends and they liked it as well. I rented this movie, not knowing what it was about and thoroughly enjoyed it. I purchased it when two members of my family died and it brought some comfort, not only to myself but others as well."
5,Must See!,"I really enjoyed this movie... reminds you that everything you do, good or bad affects others. That everything matters. If people understand what this movie is trying to say, it will effect a change in society. Watch it and try to prove me wrong!"
1,Zzzzzzzzz.......,Complete waste of my time. The only good thing about this movie is Ellyn Burstyn and Jon Voight. That's it. I'm glad I only rented it. The title sounded so good too. Sad.
5,Wow buddy wow,Hmm Randy Hamilton I wonder if you are refering to yourself in point 5. Talk about having no life.
5,In the end .. what was found is all that we ALL seek.,I found this movie to be wonderful and thought provoking. I recommend it to anyone who has lost a loved-one and think that love is forever lost or who has doubts about the power of forgiveness.
5,FIve People You Meet in Heaven,This was a well written book and well done movie. Jon Voight was excellent as the lead character and the supporting actors were also excellent. I found this movie stuck very well to the book and did a great job with a profoundly touching subject.
4,A Novel approach to the afterlife,"Eddie dies and goes to heaven where he learns his life has been meaningful to at least 5 people. I enjoyed watching this movie, and I feel it allows us to appreciate the little things done for others...not making us feel guilty because we did not change the world with a bang."
5,No Life Is Meaningless,"This is an exploration of what really matters and that no ones life is meaningless.This movie is well done in all categories. It is about Eddie played by Jon Voight who we watch spend his last hours on earth in his usually way, maintaining the Ruby Pier amusement park rides. But something goes wrong, and Edie dies on his birthday while trying to save a little girl.In heaven Eddie meets five people who help him realize what his life meant. We follow his story with flashbacks from the present to the 1920's, eight decades of a life explained in a way that will move and comfort you."
5,the five people you met in heaven,Extraordinary piece of art. even though the move is a little bouring at the beginning it motivates you to think and to analyze he concept of after life.
5,THIS NEVER HAPPENS!!!!,"The movie is practically a step-by-step of the book i.e. it's accurate to the original story line! I was pleasantly surprised by that! Movies are always super jacked up from the book so I'm glad, for once, someone realized, ""hey, the book was great, let's stick to that!"" I definitely recommend the movie (and the book too!) XD"
5,I love this movie,"I think everyone in the world should be made to watch this movie. You get so much out of it. It is a bit slow, but it has SUCH a huge message!!"
4,Learning Self Worth Isn't Easy,"Lost Pallies: The Afterlife has found it's voice and now it won't stop talking!Particularly for Eddie who has always thought of himself as worthless. The five people he meets in heaven teach him how wrong he is about himself. The story as is always the case with this author, moves you from page one to page none in no time."
4,Great Movie- Poor-Quality DVD,"I really enjoyed this movie, and I don't generally watch television movies. It's well-written, well-acted, and generally uplifting.The DVD itself is very poor quality, though. The audio levels are horrible. The music and sound effects are very loud and the narrative audio is way too low. We were constantly turning the volume up to hear the characters, then getting aurally blasted when the sound effects or music would kick in.Rent it, don't buy it."
5,NOW I CAN COOK CAJUN AND CREOLE!,"Chef John Folse's THE EVOLUTION OF CAJUN AND CREOLE CUISINE is an absolute must for any kitchen, whether it is home to a well-seasoned chef or a ripe, budding cook. Folse's description of the seven nations that settled Louisiana, the intermarriage of their cultures and cuisine and the recipes found between the covers of this book culminate in a ""mouth-watering"" explosion of down-home, Louisiana flavor.The recipe format was easy to follow and ingredients were easy to find in most any supermarket. From cooking the roux to garnishing the final dish, EVOLUTION turns the simplest meals into culinary masterpieces."
5,This stuff is awesome!,I've ordered it twice from the same seller. The shipment was fast and I love this product. I will be buying it again when I'm about to run out. Great ingredients and tastes great. Makes a perfect lunch!
2,Too thin for greeting cards,"I bought this for making greeting cards, but it is much too thin. The cardstock that I've purchased at WalMart is much better quality at a similar price."
1,Lightweight Not What I Was Looking For,"I'm not sure what people are supposed to do when ordering paper on-line... But someone needs to come up with a system that normal people can understand. What the heck is ""CARD STOCK"" really supposed to be. To my way of thinking... business card appropriate. That is not the case here! Too light."
5,THIS IS A WONDEFUL PRODUCT,"I have used heavy card stock before but this is by far the best and least expensive than when purchased in an office supply store. I can say with certainty that any of you using a HP printer (the Officejet and Deskjet-check with HP about others at 1-800-HP INVENT) will have no problem using this heavy weight card stock. When printed material such a greeting cards or calendars are produced the quality looks outstanding. Recently, I inquired at the print area of an office supply store about prices of their card stock--I was told EIGHTY CENTS A SHEET And not even as good--what does this cost--about four and one half cents per sheet, If this were 80 cents each the package would cost $200.00Wausau Paper Card Stock, 96 Brightness, 65 lb, Letter, Bright White, 250 Sheets per Pack (91904)"
4,Nice light cardstock,"Nice bright white cardstock, not too heavy, for making folded card projects. Exactly as described, and folds cleanly for a single fold. Not recommended for a multiple-fold project."
2,Too thin,Ugh! I took a chance despite some negative reviews. It's OK. It is definitely thicker than regular paper but I've bought nicer cardstock at big box store. Won't buy this brand again.
4,good all-purpose paper,"I used this paper for wedding programs and misc. cards for the wedding and the thickness was perfect. It's advertised as bright white but it definitely wasn't. In the end that didn't matter to me, I just wanted a sturdy card stock that wasn't too thick to fit a standard laser printer."
5,Greeting Cards,"I frequently make greeting cards for friends and family, and found this product to be top-shelf in price and quality; much better price than in local stores."
5,"Good quality, right thickness","Bought this for Girl Scouts to make cards for nursing homes with. Works perfectly. Just the right thickness - not so thick that the girls can't fold it easy, but thick enough to hold up to young hands. I will buy it again."
5,Excellent shoe still made in the USA!,"I have been looking for a new pair of dress oxfords and found these during the big Amazon Shoe sale. I had never heard of the brand and was astonished to find that they were made in the USA. I ordered a pair of the burgundy Providence Oxfords and also a pair of the Hotsprings apron toe oxfords. When the shoes arrived about 4 days later I was very impressed. Not only were the shoes well packaged but each one was placed inside a black cloth bag in the box. They appear to be very well made, not the cheap Chinese junk in most stores. They would be a bargain for 2X Amazon's price. I'm thinking about ordering another pair just to have when these wear out, which might take a while."
5,LIZA MINELLI LIVE AT RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL,"It is an extraordinary spectacle. Outstanding performance by Minelli, still in top form, singing, dancing.Ensemble backing her is tops. So is music, lighting, choreography .She was without a doubt the outstanding ""One Woman Show"" star in the world, from the seventies to the early nineties.I also recommend buying 'LIZA WITH A Z"", which was directed and choreographed by the great Bob Fosse."
4,LIZA IN NEW YORK!,"THIS DVD OF MINNELLI'S PRESENTS HER IN TOP FORM AND WITH GOOD TASTE INSONG AND PERFORMANCE. SHE COULD ONLY JUST DO WITHOUT THE 12 ""DEMON DIVAS""-THEY ARE NOT THAT GOOD, AND SHE ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT NEED THEM!LIZA MINNELLI HERSELF OF COURSE IS GREAT IN THIS PERFORMANCE ANDSHE STILL IS TODAY!"
1,Bad Burn..,The voice and the video of the DVD Liza Minnelli: Live from Radio City Music Hall are out of phase... it's too bad
3,the performance of a lifetime???,"Well, maybe I have to watch this once again, because I couldn't wait for this to be over. I thought I would love everything Liza did, but maybe because I didn't know the songs I didn't enjoy it."
1,"i tried to give it a zero star, but the computer would not let me, so it's a 1","i am very displeased with this product. no noticeable difference in skin texture/look and i've used most of jar trying to give it a chance. i've used it 1-2 x per week for a few weeks now. i've used another product for a few years, but i thought i should change it up a little. i will be going back to my original product."
4,I love this stopwatch!,"I really like the look and feel of it. It has a really good 'heft' to it and feels like it is build like a battleship. If you threw it at somebodys head it would leave a dent, unlike the cheap plastic ones out there. The large display is very easy to read. The buttons are very positive to use and have a nice 'click' to them. It looks like the old fashioned mechanical stopwatches, but is only a third the price. 4 out of 5 because I wish it had a stand-by mode (it is always on) and Emerson do not seem to have a website, and I have lost the original manual and want to reset the default count-down time to something else. Guess I will just have to sit and play with button combinations for 20 minutes or so ..."
3,Stopwatch is ok,"It's ok as far as stopwatches go, but the inability to turn it off makes the battery life short."
5,Gym floors were shakin' all over this land,"Gym floors WERE shakin' whenever the local AM disc jockey was cool enough to play Joe Tex's latest sermon. Yes brethren, I said sermon. The man was a secular preacher, marriage counseler, and hmmm? what else? oh yeah... a whole bunch of fun too! Wallflowers of both sexes left the walls and danced to 'Show Me','Skinny Legs And All',and ' One Monkey Don't Stop No Show"".Joe Tex preached the gospel of the wallflower.The man (kid with pimples) with the raggeddy clothes, the woman (girl with braces) with the skinny legs. He had a great big heart that encouraged everybody to take part and have fun. Everybody. This collection does a good service to both old fans of Joe and newcomers alike. I prefer the sixties stuff myself, but I can still remember driving in my first car in 1972 and hearing ""I Gotcha"" coming out of the AM speakers. Got me!"
5,One Of My Favorite R&B Albums!,"A classic example of American R&B; one of my most-played albums. Tex had soul, humor, and a good voice. The album has a nice mix of fast and slow, dance and listen, warmth and hardness. Favorite song: Sweet Little Woman Like You."
1,A mistake,"This is a poorly written book. It is repetitious in the extreme, full of poorly chosen words and phrases, tortured or unnecessary imagery and obtuse syntax. Something, in short, that you might expect from an English professor at a religious institution. I wish I had seen the pictures and bios of the authors before I made the purchase. Perhaps the most annoying aspect of this work is the cheerleader attitude that permeates it. It's plumped up when it ought to be slimmed down. (Where was the editor?) Judging by the tone of the text and the language used, it seems to have been written in a delusional state by persons with no solid contact with, or experience of, the world (professors)."
5,"Amazon, Fix Your Sampler!","Great music by a great band! But if Amazon wants to reap more sales from it, they need to fix the severely screwed-up sampler selections on this album! 'Nights Are Forever' features (just barely if you strain to hear it) the last, fading-out line of the song, THEN the between-the-tracks silence, then the beginning of the next song! It continues being one song off until 4-5 songs later, when it totally LEAVES OUT the sample for 'We'll Never Have To Say Goodbye Again', then corrects itself for the next song. So two of the major hits just aren't there. GET IT TOGETHER, AMAZON!"
5,Takes Me Back!,"This CD contains the noteworthy works of England Dan and John Ford Coley. When I inserted the CD, it took me back! The quality of the recordings were excellent. Thank you for a trip down ""memory lane""."
5,Music,"Nights Are Forever Without You (England Dan and John Ford Coley on Cover)This was one CD I was hoping to find because some of the songs brought back fond memorys for me. I'm glad I was able to get this and to find it in new condition. Have not had a problem with it, I'm just afraid I'll wear it out. Thank you again in helping me to get something I really wanted."
3,Fantastic Memories; So-So compilation,"While it's nice to see England Dan & John Ford Coley deemed worthy of a Rhino ""The Very Best of...."" CD, it's a little disappointing that many of the tracks mentioned in the liner notes that actually DID chart have been cast aside for those the producers prefer. Still, chances are if you're looking for this CD, you're looking for ""I'd Really Love to See You Tonight"" and/or ""It's Sad to Belong."" They're here."
5,Great Music,"This cd is already one of my favorites.The harmonies of these two men is wonderful and the music,lyrics of their songs are from back when you could listen to music without being afraid of bad language and offensive images."
2,Lightweight,"This lightweight 70's MOR has not aged well - not that it was terribly profound to begin with. A bare handful of modestly pleasant (at best) hit singles is not really enough to build an entire collection around, and some of the filler here is quit painful to hear some 20 years after the fact."
3,Just Tell Me You Love Me is Missing?,"Is there a good reason why ""Just Tell Me You Love Me"" is not on either the Very Best Of CD by ED&JFC or the Greatest Hits CD by this band? If you go to youtube, the song has over half a million hits. This was a huge hit and a great song, so what is the logic for this song missing from those two CDs?"
5,Great Collection,I couldn't believe how many familiar songs were included in this CD of England Dan & John Ford Coley. It's terrific and I would definitely recommend it to others.
5,Great Choice,I have always been a fan of 70s music and ordered a trio of CD's. I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived quicker than I thought. The music brings back great memories and the greatest hits combos are the best.
4,Timeless,"Many of these songs were the soundtrack to my life back then. It was a pleasure to listen to this and go back in time. The later material did nothing for me, though. But you can't get much better than the hits."
5,A CD that brings back a lot of Good Old Feelings!!!!!!!!!,My wife and I have special memories that this CD helps keep alive. We dated in High School and some how our paths crossed some 20 years later . So the opening lines of I'd Really Love To See You Tonight and the song We'll Never Have To Say Goodbye Again means something special to us. This is a GREAT CD and the Music is FANTASTIC......
