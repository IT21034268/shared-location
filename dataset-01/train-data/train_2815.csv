3,Live at Ronnie Scott's preferred by a country mile,"If the far more lively and musically interesting ""Live at Ronnie Scott's"" DVD did not exist as part of Curtis' skimpy legacy on video, ""Live at Montreux"" would assume a greater importance in the material we're left with. While it does represent Curtis' unique approach acceptably, ""Live at Ronnie Scott's"" is far, far better and includes much of the same material and some of the same sidemen. Without knowing the actual performance dates, the two gave me the impression of being performances from pretty close to the same time.I got this one AFTER ""Live at Ronnie Scott's"" and, frankly, found it an actual disappointment by comparison."
2,Could have bben better,"This collection has MOST of her hits-but leaves out a few essential Jett-rocks: LITTLE LIAR, FAKE FRIENDS, DIRTY DEEDS,REAL WILD CHILD, EYE TO EYE and others in favor of songs that don't belong here like I WANT YOU, LET'S DO IT (this version has Greg Gaffin of Bad Religion on it, who didn't want to be a part of it when it was released in 95, so his vocals were replaced by Paul Westerberg-THAT vewrsion should be here, not this one), SCIENCE FICTION ( a slowed down version of a great song-but here it is awful).The packaging is also cheap looking and very skimpy."
4,Joan Jett & The Blackhearts - 'Jett Rock: Greatest Hits' (JVC),"Nicely assembled 22 track Japanese import of the former Runaway's long-running repertoire. Tunes here that's sure to bring back many memories to most '80's generation rockers include ""I Hate Myself For Loving You"", Jett's first claim to fame on her own - ""I Love Rock 'N Roll"", ""Bad Reputation"", ""Do You Wanna Touch Me (Oh Yeah), ""Light Of Day"" and numerous others. Long live girl rock!"
3,Not bad for what it is,"I don't give a damn about my repintashe...everything else is so particular. That's my line cause that how I always do feel. I wouldn't lie to ya. Lil Joanie Peupty Jett has almost outdone her kind of manly self. She made the good music, yes she really wanted to and really she probably did. But this is a IMPORTED GOOD. That's something I just don't agree with. Send it back to eva where it come from. Buy AMERICANA por favor (as the spanish sometimes say)."
4,Old timely recipes,"I have loved this cookbook since I visited the Pioneer Kitchen in Washington, Arkansas in the 80's. We met Inez at the kitchen- her husband was perched on the porch and ushered us in when we visited this historic town. We bought the cookbook then...a nice resource for some historic recipes that you might want for special occasions. I have used some of these old recipes in my classroom when we were studying history. She also includes some historic holiday recipes. Her stories interspersed between & among the recipes is fun to read. I would tell anyone interested in old time recipes of the South to get this book."
2,good book for diet,"I enjoyed this book as much as I enjoy my new beverage of choice. Made from 100% organic soy, taste just like coffee and no caffeine. Finally, I got rid of that wired up feeling all day and feeling great. Look for it on the net by googling ""s o yfee"
4,A good buy,I bought this hat to keep my ever-more-balding head out of the sun while doing simple chores around the yard and while walking. It does the job without excessively heating up my head. I unexpectedly found out that it does a great job of keeping the rain off my head as well. I'm very satisfied.
4,I bought they sent and they followed up,I bought they sent and they followed up to see if everything arrived okay. I would buy from them again.Bimini Bay Whitewater Hat Khaki
4,LifeSource Bits,"I chose this food for my dog because it was the only one without a ""filler"" ingredient high in the list. Although I've been feeding cheaper brands to dogs in the past, I've since learned about the potential pet health impacts of doing so. Overall, it's working out but not as well as it could be with my picky eater.My dog's a fan of several different varieties of the kibble, but *not* the LifeSource Bits (the little brown kibbles that have all the antioxidants that are one of the main benefits). He picks them out and will only eat them when he's *really* hungry. I've read plenty of reviews on pet-oriented sites about dogs who do the same.If your dog is not a picky eater, the kind who never finds the pill you hide in the food, you'll probably have no issues with this brand. If your dog picks out the ""bits,"" you may have to feed him a little less or choose a different brand."
5,It simply works well.,"If you are spending big bucks on your speakers you owe it to yourself to put these behind them.It made a very noticeable difference in the bass coming out of the 6"" woofers in my component system especially at higher volumes.I was turned into a believer."
3,ENJOYABLE AND ENERGETIC --- BUT NOT A TRULY GREAT RIDE,"Michael Kidd's ""Destry,"" with music and lyrics by Harold Rome, is a zesty, rousing reminder of how great even marginal musicals of the '50s were. Produced the same year as ""Gypsy,"" ""The Sound of Music"" and ""Fiorello,"" the score contains no standards, but has some lovely ensembles and ballads, as well as some wonderful whoop-it-up western tunes.Starring Andy Griffith, who had yet to discover the idyllic pleasures of Mayberry and sultry Dolores Gray and based on the Marlene Dietrich-Jimmy Stewart comedy, ""Destry"" would be a welcome addition to any musical buff's library ... even if you won't be too eager to let it ride again and again on your CD player. (Submitted by staff member Stephen J. Finn)"
5,Very good charger,works great! easy to use. Power cord is short but i guess that is why it is a travel charger.
2,What can you expect for the price,"Does it work? Kind of. It worked on my wife's cell phone if she turns the phone off during charging. My cell phone it actually drained the battery. I have a cheap Samsung phone. My wife has a nicer Samsung phone.So for the price, I guess it is ok but I would not purchase it again."
1,DO NOT BUY IT!!!!,"The charger did not work! It's my fault for even thinking that something that costs pennies would work. The charger itself was a cheap replica of the original samsung charger. Anyways, future customers please be aware and do no purchase items that have a price which is too good to be true!"
3,BORNRIGHT,THE CELL PHONE CHARGER WORKS GREAT. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THE CORD ITSELF IS 3FT. AND TO SHORT WHEN YOU PLUG IT IN TO PUT IT ON A DESK OR TABLE. I USUALLY LEAVE IT ON THE FLOOR. THE NORMAL CORD THAT COMES WITH THE PHONE IS 6 FT AND THIS ONE IS I/2 THAT LENGTH. OTHER THEN THAT ISSUE THE CHARGER IS OK.
2,Samsung chargers,This product came with a wire not attached and I had to take the whole thing apart and re-wire it myself. The car charger I purchased for 14 cents and paid $5 for shipping is the wrong one and pointless to return for 14 cents and another shipping fee.Not my best purchases to date.
2,Not worth the price,"Unfortunately, I don't recall seeing the size of the sticker before I ordered it. It's a lot smaller than I expected. The shipping charges are way out of line. It could have been put in a kraft envelope and mailed for $1.39. Very disappointed."
4,Good for CSA members too!,"My mother in law gave me this book when she found out that we had a membership in a community farm or CSA. That's where you pay a fee up front at the beginning of the season for a ""share"" of what the garden produces. This book is very handy for coming up with ideas for things you have a lot of, but it also has a lot of good info about preservation and how long certain produce last under different conditions. In that sense it's not just a cookbook, it's a reference book too. And the zucchini enchiladas are pretty popular at our house!"
2,Disappointing,"An inviting cover, but with so many other recipe source options, I'd put this one on my ""B"" list. The lack of illustrations makes for a very boring read and difficult to visualize the hoped for end result."
2,Disappointment in the making,"To be honest, I bought this book for my brother in law and was really excited about it because he is a die hard duck hunter. He goes to Alaska for special trips at least once a year, and otherwise spends many hours perfecting his duck call and training his dog. But to be honest, the book was a disappointment. The writing accompanying the photos was mediocre at best. Disjointed and forced, the photos at least tried to create a story. But even the photos were not as entertaining as the review would lead you to believe. This book really deserves only two stars. It does look like a nice coffee table book, but after paging through the first few pages, I don't foresee many dying to finish it."
2,Not much to it,"Okay, so all us crazy waterfowlers at times go over our waders, have calls ice up, get splashed by the dog, etc. so what? Show me something I don't see every year."
1,Lower Your Expectations,"I love outdoor stories, especially about hunting and fishing. Most are well written and the illustrations are a minor part of the read. This book can best be described as a photo album with commentary as opposed to a story to be enjoyed or admired. Imagine looking through your hunting buddies photos with marginally funny comments. if you do, then don't buy this book and you will save 10 dollars.No plot and the humor isn't especially clever. The pictures only sometimes weakly illustrate the comments and the joke falls flat.Anyway, i will continue to read the quality work but this is not going on my shelf."
1,Disappointed,I recently purchased this book and returned it the next day. I was very disappointed in the lack of technical detail. Several areas were focused on Germany regulations and not appropriate for the US.
5,!!!!!!bangin baseline!!!!!!!!,"IVE SEEN THESE GUYS LIVE IN YBOR CITY A FEW YEARS BACK AND LETS JUST PUT IT THIS WAY THE VIBES I GOT JUST ROLLED TO MY EARS!! THERE IS NO OTHER TRIO OUT THERE THAT COME CLOSE IN THE ECLECTIC STYLE OF MUSIC!! IF YOU KNOW YOUR BREAKS AND INTELLEGENT SOUNDS IT DOESNT MATTER IF YOUR FROM FLORIDA OR NOT, PICK UP ON THIS CD!! THESE GUYS ARE THE MASTERS OF ROLLING BASELINES!!!"
1,Just Awful,Had the phone for less than 1 year and I loved it for 1/2 that time until 1 wouldn't ring or the other would hang up. Bought new batteries thinking that was the problem.........It wasn't! Not well made andV-Tech is not helpful at all. Panasonic next time!!
4,simple in content but difficult in vocabulary,"This book approaches pragmatics from a very different angle: interaction between interlocutors in a conversation or some sort of speech events like that. Due to this fact, I guess, some classicial subdomains of pragmatics are not included, such as presupposition and deixis, and issues like politeness are mentioned. As a nonnative speaker of English, I find it a little bit difficult to leave my dictionaries (note the plural forms of dictionary) far away from me. The wide variety of words with heavey culture-specific information make it hard for even proficient speakers to get the gist immediately.It appears strange to me that why Thomas does not mention the taxanomy she discuss in her article published in Applied Linguistics in 1983. Has she aborted the distinction between sociopragmatics and pragmalinguistics?"
4,It was a N.E Heartbreak!,"I love this album. They took some of the greatest solo hits of this super group and included it one on album. I love Ralph T'S ""Sensitivity"" and Bobby B's ""On Our Own"" from Ghostbusters II soundtrack. This would have gotten 5 stars but the only had the original lineup of N.E and they negelected to have any of Johnny Gill's solo hits like ""MY,MY,MY"" or ""Rub You the Right Way"""
4,Good Solid Overview,this is Good Overview of the Impact of New Edition.Where are the Johnny Gill Songs?that's the only thing Hurting this Disc from being Very Essential.Still it's a Good Solid Disc of Material that has had an Impact on The Music World Over The Last 20 years.I Don't Believe Any Of The Boy Bands Of Today will Be Able Too FOrm as Many OffSPirngs as this Group Has&Be as Successful at it.that's The Depth Of New Edition.
5,The Jamaican Stevie Wonder Frankie Paul at his very best,"Frankie Paul is a great vocalist and this CD proves it with great songs Like ""Thanks & Praise"" (The Lord Prayer in Reggae) and ""I Am Sorry"". Every song on this album is a hit in my opinion.Back up vocals on this album was done by Mikey Spice another great Jamaican vocalist.For all lovers of conscious Reggae this CD is a must have for your collection."
4,funny and sad,"The characters in Loving Edith are quirky, funny and sad, but never pitiful or unsympathetic. This is quite an accomplishment considering the snooty world of literary magazines that Tannen is writing about. Has the author ever worked at a literary magazine? I wonder if this novel really IS based on some of the figures from the New Yorker. At any rate, a charming read, one that will stay with you, cliche and all."
3,Don't read it for the history,"The focus of the book was in solving the mystery, and the answer was fairly clever (though I did solve it long before our heroes did). The pacing was good, and the characters engaging. The world-building was okay. It often felt to me like this mystery could have happened at any time but had a few historical things dropped in to make it a historical. The social structure shown in the book certainly wasn't typical of the time. The characters are what kept me reading, not the mystery of the history.Also, I'm 99% sure that the method used to kill would not actually kill a person. This ruined the whole story for me. (It's not not what was used to kill the person but how the death was given that I have problems with.)"
3,A very light Victorian mystery.,"I read a lot of historical mysteries, and I love Victorian ones, so that is why I've begun the Emily Brightwell series about the clever Mrs. Jeffries. This book is written with a light hand, but the characters show promise. The bumbling Inspector Witherspoon, the street smart Smythe, the uppity cook Mrs. Goodge, and Betsey and Wiggins, as well as Mrs. Jeffries. These characters show a lot of promise, and I will continue to read this series. But readers don't expect a real Victorian flavour to these books. I found while reading the book that it was set in the Victorian age, but it very easily could have been any other era or place. Even the English cozy atmosphere that the writer tries to depict seems a bit contrived. For those who read the historical genre for atmosphere, they will find that as well as a sense of time and place is somewhat lacking in this series. Still a fun mystery (even though an easy one to figure out)."
3,Enjoyable but not a brain teaser.,It is good for a fast relaxing read. The treatment of the inspector is a little overdone. I doubt he could be that bumbling.
2,Political Correctness in Victorian England?,"As stated in the summary above, I found this a very unconvincing ""Victorian"" mystery. Mrs. Jeffries's so conscious about PC that the period flavor of this book is definitely of the 1990s, not of 100 or so years ago. Makes one wonder why bother to plant the whole cast in Victorian England at all. Perhaps merely to justify that a police inspector should have the means to support such an extensive household?"
1,too expensive,Can someone please explain to me why the CD with only 11 songs is priced at $99.90 ? I have never paid 100.00 for a cd and will not pay that much for this one. I do not understand the pricing structure on this. How can they justify $100.00 for a CD. Please let me know.Thanks
2,Not the one!,"This might be okay for kittens that are more prone to entertain themselves but my 6 yr old cats were not interested, even when I tried to turn it into an interactive toy. All I can say it that it seems to be constructed well. Otherwise another boring cat toy!"
5,Another win by Michael Biehl,"If you enjoyed Doctored Evidence, you will love this one. It is Karen Hayes at her best uncovering mystery and murder at the local hospital. With its multiple twists and surprises, it is impossible to put down and keeps you guessing. The book provides an interesting inside view of hospital operations and large attorney corporations. Don't miss this one."
5,SAY HER NAME--PATTI PATTI,"If there is one woman that deserves a Divas Live tribute is Patti Labelle. No one can sing like this woman.I got to know her from ""If only you knew"", but if only I knew that she would have such a collection of hits on one album. It is truly a gem of an album.Her voice is one that gets never fails and just doesn't crack like the others. Patti Labelle FOREVER.THIS is a COLLECTERS ITEM. GET IT GET IT. Every song let's you know who's running the show and it is Patti. No one can compare"
4,Love La Bella Donna!!,For the most part enjoy the CD but the song which I most wanted from it had a version which I do not enjoy unfortunately.
4,Good but not greatest,This cd is good but not greatest as far as i'm concerned.I mean i took away 4 songs and added 5 other crucial songs to create a great Patti cd on my own so to speak.
5,Where Have I Been All These Years?,"For many years, I resisted Patti LaBelle. While others have revered her as a flawless diva, I held my distance, perceiving her as a theatrical singer with an excessively loud voice. But, one day, I saw the light and recognized the talent that is Patti, and bought this CD. It's like, WOW! This CD is great! The emotion and heart that she puts into these songs is incredible. The touching ballad ""Somebody Loves You"" will move you to tears, while ""New Attitude,"" despite its dated production, still sounds fresh. Her version of ""If You Asked Me to"" also outclasses the version Celine Dion would later butcher. Moreover, there's also ""Lady Marmelade,"" the Labelle classic which Christina, Kim, Pink, and Mya would later destroy on the ""Moulin Rouge"" soundtrack. I am now kicking myself for not liking Patti sooner. She is truly a talented diva who deserves her praise, and I strongly recommend this disc!"
4,XP style interface but slower,"I'm a geek. I know my computers. I took Ubuntu and loaded it in a different disk drive used as master. I had XP loaded in a similar drive used as master. I switched the drives to go from one operating system to another for the simple reason that I wanted to benchmark each operating system. Although Ubuntu is free and is decently supported by the ubuntu site and lynux drivers, it was slower than XP. Specifically when I used java based applets.If you're not a power user (like me) and don't want to pay gobs to Billy Gates, then get Ubuntu. Their support site is awesome and very good people are dedicated in the project, however, you still have to know more about computers than you would with XP.Vista is hosed, take it from me, put up with the speed reduction than be thrown back to the dark ages with Vista. There is less support for Vista than Ubuntu. Go figure."
3,Love Ubuntu but pissed!,"I love Ubuntu, but I am pissed that they released 7.04 before working out the ATI driver problems- I can install 6.xx but not 7 because of my ati x1400. I dislike windows DRM so much that I will patiently wait until they fix the problem and buy it again. It was only $10.00 and it did work on my old desktop fine, but not my dell inspiron e1505 w/x1400."
5,Ubuntu Rocks. I just dont know why people still use windows.,"It is fast, stable, it has no known viruses, no spyware... and it is FREE. Do i need to say anything else?"
4,The Jayhawkers an Entertaining Western,"This is an odd little Western set in the 1850s, with Jeff Chandler and Fess Parker on opposite sides of the law. Chandler, as Luke Darcy, plays a very noble yet misguided self-appointed leader of a band of outlaws bent on seeing his vision of society's mores come to fruition. Chandler brings integrity and determination to his role. Parker is always good in his homespun way. Henry Silva is also on hand demonstrating his wry presence. The film's greatest asset (and probably why I always liked this film) is its score by Jerome Moross, best known for ""The Big Country."" If you listen close you can hear strains of his theme for the TV show ""Wagon Train."" The VHS color print is vivid."
4,"CELESTE MENDOZA- ""FORBIDDEN CUBA OF THE 60'S""","RMM Records did a very good job in this re-edition of songs recorded in Cuba by Celeste Mendoza during the 60's. The sound of these recordings is great and Celeste's musical tribute to the late cuban singer Beny More entitled ""Desaparecio El Montero"" is included in this 12 song compilation. However due to the importance of these recordings and their hard to get or nearly impossible to find statusoutside of Cuba,before this and other similar re-editions by other labels, I think RMM should've included more songs in this CD, for example 15 or 16 hits instead of just 12. However this is still a great sounding CD of great songs by the late cuban diva."
3,projector bulb,"Bought two of these, which were labeled GE bulbs, not Kodak. One burned out after about 10 hours of use after it cracked!! Other one is still going, but only has about 2 hours on it!! Projector is a Kodak model 4400 carousel."
5,My review,Arrived on time. Seems like the projector bulbs are what I ordered and they are in good condition. Excllant transaction. I won't know for sure until I actually use the bulbs.
4,Straightforward approach to Thai cuisine,"This is one of the first Thai cookbooks I purchased. Since then I have purchased several others, but I keep coming back to this one as my starting point for creating an Asian menu. As most other reviewers have stated, the directions are clear and the ingredient list is manageable. Young offers some helpful tips along the way to make it easier.Some of the humor sprinkled throughout the book is an unexpected surprise. I love the spicy chile sauce recipe where the last step is ""call the fire department"". There could be more photos in my opinion, but that is not a major issue.All in all a good investment is you want to learn how to cook Thai food. And if you are like me, living in an area that is devoid of closeby Thai restaurants, it is a necessity for those of us who need our Thai ""fix"" on a regular basis."
5,my favorite book on Thai cooking,"I have been using this book for about a year now and have used many of the recipes. The results beat any Thai restaurant. Do not be frightened by the long lists of ingredients, as they are not hard and the recipes are very clear."
3,Pretty good but....,"I do indeed like this book, its not over wordy and ponderous. But included many interesting tips and tid-bits of knowledge from Wandee. I have many many excellent dishes using this book, but they are not like those at her resturant. For instance the Pad Thai served at her resturant has a pinkish/salmon tinge, and has lots of flavour. But the finished product using recipe in the book is much blander and has none of the pinkish tinge. Other recipes also taste differently from those at her resturant. Its a good book, but I was led to beleive that these were the recieps used at her resturant. Since they are clearly not, I'm quite disapointed."
5,Great recipes,"These recipes produce great results. The basil chicken is incredibly fragrant and so is the chicken coconut noodle dish. I love that the ingredients are not overly obscure and the methods/preparation is very doable. A lot of thai books use really strange ingredients for authenticity. This book strikes a balance between using what you are comfortable with while producing delicious Thai dishes. It is aimed at those cooking in a western kitchen but the food is still extremely flavorful and ""authentic"". Highly recommended."
1,Too much oil in every recipe!!!,"I was so excited to get this book, but it sucks and I'm not keeping it. The recipes use a disgusting amount of oil - up to 1 cup!! And then after cooking you are supposed to let your food drain through a drive to ""allow excess oil to drain"". The pictures are dated photography - they look like they were taken in the 80's, and there's only one picture every 30 pages. Lame book, bad layout, too much oil.. Total turn-off."
2,Simply Thai Cooking,"I just got this book and I'm very disappointed; even thought, I haven't prepared a thing. There is some picture but it doesn't reference the name of the food that's in the picture. How do I suppose to know the recipes of the food that's in the picture? For most of the pages, it doesn't have a picture of the food....it only recipes. I don't know how the food will be taste like or looks like? If there's a picture, you would say that's looks good but there's no picture. There are millions of recipes, do we suppose to know what's good or not; without providing a picture or sampling it? When a food looks good, people will try to prepare it. If you not a Thai, then you will be very disappointed because you'll not know what your food looks like when you try to prepare it."
4,He Did It Again,KRS-One once again proves he is a force to be recognized in the Hip-Hop genre. I was thoroughly impressed with this release and look forward for his latest.
5,worth it,I read this book while waiting to have an appendectomy. This book was so random that I laughed so hard that it hurt.
5,"Concerned with the ""worlds"" spiritual decline? Read it!!!","Mr. Hunt gives a ""shoot-from-the-hip"" and take no prisoners approach to the biblical standards of our time. We are so used to being spoon fed and not held accountable for our choices. Well, once you read this book, you will have a decision to make. One you may not find too easy. He makes the way to the Father plain and simple. You must either take the narrow or broad path. He removes the blinders and the light is so bright because we have been asleep far too long. Mr. Hunt has a wake-up call for us all and we haven't any time for a snooze...."
3,Decent Indie Rock,"Hundred Hands is just another anonymous sounding indie rock group on the scene. Don't get me wrong, its not bad, but it doesn't stand out. The high production value helps inmensely. Also, competent instrumentation creates generally pleasant music but the songs are too slow and diberate. As a reult,the tracks blend sort of monotonously together after a while. Emotionless scratchy vocals spit out cliche phrases and cover over done subjects. Slight rhythym changes and guitar patterns alert the listener that a new song has begun. Hundred Hands provides great backround music but for listening purposes, I'll take my Death Cab For Cutie or Pedro The Lion anyday."
2,buyer beware,"Before you purchase this product I HIGHLY reccomed you call Dexpan. No where on Amazon, the instruction sheet or packaging warns you that this product can not be used on materials LESS THAN 6"" thick. Unfortunately I found this out only after renting the drill and 1.5"" bit, purchasing 2 11# units of dexpan and drilling 100+ holes in a 4'x42'x4"" driveway ""apron"". Had I known this prior, I obviuolsy would have gone in a different direction and not waited for 7 days for the product to do it's ""magic"". However, I can say that if used in materials AT LEAST 6"" THICK, it will do the job for sure. I have requested a full refund which Dexpan says they will happily provide.If I in fact receive the credit (close to $100), I will use this produce in the future shoudl I have right project."
2,Even an elephant could forget this one,"The writer and director also takes the lead role... a recipe for disaster. The story idea is a good one that could possibly lead to comedy, but it hasn't worked too well here.If you're a fan of Jennifer Esposito, be warned that she has a very minor role in this movie."
3,disappointed,This movie was a bit of a let down to me. The guy in this is a total jerk. His fiance is willing to do just about anything for him but he is not willing to do ANYTHING for her. He gets her to go out with a girl and then gets jealous. She finally gets him to go out with a guy and he's extremely rude to the guy the whole time. This movie could have been a lot better if it had better writers.
3,Rent it,This is not worth the money to buy. Good movie to see once but not to own. It was a little funny and Jennifer Esposito is pretty as ever but not a keeper. Ending is predictable.
4,Very cute movie!,This is a very cute movie. The acting and the story line is OK. With several gorgeous guys!!!
5,This stuff works,My sister has taken calm advantage for ADHD for over 10 years now. I could always tell the difference in the way she was with and without. It settles her down and helps her focus and keeps her from over reacting in situations. I didnt want my son on a bunch of chemicals whaen he was diagnosed with ADD so I got him on calm advantage and it has made a big difference and helps him focus in school. Thankyou
3,Few songs are good,"Though vocals arent needed...I enjoy track 01 & 12. I do not like rock. This album entirely aimed for electronica and rock. If you do not like rock or electronica, then back up. Though if you like sooth electronica remixed into rock...then try it out. The samples will give you a good slice of Electro Organic."
4,There actually was a good story at one time!,"Reading the novel helped explain what the writers in the movie really wanted to happen, but got lost by the director during the filming. It helped fill in a lot of blanks and made situations clearer on different characters, including the background of the Thin Man. The book is still on the bubble gum side, but worth a read, especially if you felt lost or disappointed by the movie. There actually was a good story at one time! Too bad it didn't make it to the screen. Unfortunately, the second movie probably killed the franchise, but I would still love to know the outcome of Dylan's possible new love interest in a third movie. Then again, maybe it would be better if they just wrote a third book instead and left it at that!"
5,They're worth it,"These canvas bags are a bit more expensive than others offered, but I think they're worth it because they're made with a heavier canvas and have shorter handles. I've had 15 cans and several smaller items that filled a bag to the top and had no problems--no crackling or tearing seams, and no bag dragging on the ground because the handles were too long. Some food stores are now selling canvas bags, but they're not as large or sturdy as these. I keep three in my vehicle and gave my mom two, so don't worry about being able to use five! These bags are also excellent for using in shopping clubs (BJ's, Sam's, etc.) that don't supply bags, so if you're ""going green"" consider this product."
3,Good but could be better,"I bought this scanner to scan in my old negatives. This scanner will do that with no cropping required, although it is a bit of a skill to get each strip to load properly at first. I do however have a problem with this scanner, and that is that is isn't as good as it should be in aligning the negative frames with its scans. The the process of scanning is itself quite tedious as it takes about a minute per frame (yes frame, not strip, and more if you want better quality), but to be expected. However, I find some of my scans come with black edges where the alignment is just not quite right. Is this the end of the world? No, but it is annoying to have to rescan perhaps several times to get the image to occupy the full frame with none of the border also captured. This is supposed to be all automatic and to spare users from having manually to align negative strips in little plastic holders, and it does that - but the process isn't as automatic as it should be."
2,Auto feed is tricky,"I bought the 2580 because of the capability to automatically scan 35mm negatives. While it takes some time scanning each frame, loading the negatives in the auto feed is tricky. Sometimes several tries are necessary. However, the most disturbing problem is film jams. After about 50 negative scans a strip jammed in the feeder, requiring a manual removal using the feed knob (underneath the top lid). After removing the film, the auto feed no longer works. Everytime I try, a receive a red alert - Epson calls it a fatal error. I'm pursuing with customer service, but this doesn't sound good. Perhaps another brand would work better."
1,Cheap and Worthless,"I wanted my kids to have an inexpensive entry level telescope. This thing was a joke. Very cheaply made. I should have returned it. It's trash now, but a few months later. Maybe there are good cheap telescopes out there, but this isn't one of them."
3,Talented but a little lacking,"The Talent is there, no question about it. But something, I'm not exactly sure what it is, is missing. Perhaps it's the lack of passion, the less than superb production, I'm not sure. Or, perhaps I simply have tainted ears of just how good these guys are from their album ""Scars and Souvenirs"" which is one of the best albums I have and then purchasing this one.Theory of a Deadman is a fantastic band I just don't think this album is a great depiction of how good they really are. Regardless, this piece is still worth getting if you like the Theory!"
2,Nickelback clones,"i'm sorry. its obvious that these guys have a lot of talent. BUT, their songs make them sound like Nickelback clones. That is actually what I call them, cuz i can never remember their name. anyway. they are good. but they need to find their own direction."
2,Nickelback's little brother,"I don't have much to say here, everything's already been said. This band sounds exactly like Nickelback, only not as good. If you like this kind of music, Nickelback's Silver Side Up is the way to go. We don't need no stinking vikings, and we don't need no stinking clones either. If you want to know what this album is like, go see Silver Side Up reviews with this in mind : ""...only worse"".After that is said, I always try to find something positive in every record. Sometimes I can't, but this time I got lucky. Of course, if you've heard the single Make Up Your Mind and you think it's the best song ever, then buy this right now ! If you think Nickelback is the best band in the world, there's a good chance you'll like this too. And that's my cue to leave !"
2,Whatever happened to rock 'n roll?,Too many bands could mix up their members and release CDs without us knowing that there'd been a line-up change. This is one of them.NICKLEBACK's offering is staid. Did i say NICKLEBACK when i meant to say THEORY OF A DEAD MAN? Easy confusion when Chad Kroeger's the co-writer and producer ... and the lead singer sounds like him. The best track by far is 'Nothing Could Come Between Us' and will undoubtedly be a huge hit but the rest just became too much for original-wanting me.
2,Theory Of A..... BAD REVIEW....,"Well, all I can really say about this album is that it sounds as though Chad Kroeger is choking on an old, worn-out oven mit soaked in the saliva of a swine.... But, it receives two stars due to the fact that Chad was involved....."
3,Sounds like Nickleback,"They have done a few really good songs: ""Last song"", ""Point to prove"" and ""Say I'm sorry"" here on their debut CD. But I still feel that they have to work a bit more on their own melodies and their sound as a hole to succeed bigtime."
5,I'm IMPRESSED!,"I'm usually a critic of rock, but since I heard this album, I'm always trying to find more like it. If you've heard Nickelback and liked them, this is the next CD for you! Theory of a Deadman worked with Nickelback to make this CD which is one of the reasons why it's so good. This CD included the 2 hits ""Invisible Man"" from the movie ""Spider Man"" and the other hit ""Nothing Could Come Between Us."" Did you also know the song ""Hero"" by Chad Kroeger in the Spiderman movie, Tyler Connoly (Lead of Theory of a Deadman)played guitar in it? Yeah, it's true. So the bottom line is: These guys are pretty much as good as Nickelback! GO BUY THIS CD IF YOU LIKE ROCK!"
4,Very Impressed,"It really was a pleasant surprise to finally get a new band in the scene that won't flash in the pan and not be remembered tomorrow. Theory of a Deadman is a refreshing flavor of rock that sounds a lot like Nickelback and Creed rolled together. It's an awesome CD, with spectacular vocals, great guitar, and spectacular beats. It's obvious a lot of thought went into each song, as each one has depth and meaning on so many levels. Tyler Connelly really makes an impressive debut with his versatile vocals. His band seems perfectly matched to his style. It's a wonderful, refreshing CD that won't disappoint. Besides ""Nothing Could Come Between Us"" (which is probably one of the best songs of 2002), check out ""Make Up Your Mind"" and ""Point to Prove."" For me, so far, this is the best CD release of 2002...and 2003 isn't far away."
3,better then nickelback but still no more then the standard,theory of a dead man make decent alternative rock with blues elemnts. While these guys are better then chad kroeggers nickleback (cowritter) it is undeniable the lack of originality and as well as the deriativety. It ends up being typically mainstream but i guess its solid in those terms.
4,Review of Theory of a Deadman,"Overall this CD is very good. The only issue is there are only 10 songs, otherwise I would have rated it 5 stars. If you like Nickelback then you will love this CD."
5,"Wonderful Tamales, Great Treat","I have been eating these spinach tamales for years. A friend of mine introduced me to them about ten years ago. The only place where I know to buy them is the Albertson's grocery store on Northwest Highway and Midway in Dallas. That is a tremendous drive for me these days. However, when I'm in the area, I make a special trip to that grocery store and buy every package they have, except one (for the poor person who looks for them after I have cleaned the store out of their stock). I take an insulated bag in the car to keep them well on the drive home.This is worth it! I really love these tamales! I'll be happy if I can order them through Amazon, though."
5,If I could give one piece of advice to one starting the path,"....it would be not to neglect the preliminary practices for as long as I did. After years of meditation without preliminaries, I can say with certainty that meditation combined with the prayers & visualizations in this book has been far more effective.If you're uncomfortable with chanted prayers, then by all means don't push. But if you're ready to gain deep, lasting and stable experience of Buddha's teachings, the practices explained here are for you. Though certain aspects of the book are somewhat specific to Kadampa Buddhism, practitioners of any tradition can benefit from the author's clarity, depth & insight.Geshe Kelsang clearly explains a Guru Yoga practice of Je Tsongkhapa and a special method of relying upon the Dharma Protector, the Buddhist equivalent of a Patron Saint."
2,Disappointed...,"I was looking for a CD to help augment my basic Spanish with ""Construction Spanish"". Unfortunately this CD spends far too little time on what the title promises.It starts off with a lengthy sales pitch about why this CD is an important tool like a nail gun. Thanks but wheres the construction spanish? After the sales pitch it starts in on how to pronounce vowels in spanish then on to phrases like Que Pasa. Ay yay yay.There are legions of resources out there to help with the basics of spanish. This CD wastes time going over them again. By the time they get to some of the actual Construction Spanish its just about over."
4,Easy to Learn Construction Spanish,Finally something my superintendents can listen to in their truck to better speak with our Hispanic workers. They carry the mini handout in their pocket when at the job sites. Excellent.
5,A delightful opera performance at the height of Anna Netrebko's popularity,"I bought this particular DVD in order to own one of the most charming moments in Anna Netrebko's career.Her rendering of Musetta's waltz here, in the open air theater, in front of thousands of people, is most endearing, and the public breaks out in bravos even before she is finished."
4,Waldbühne Berlin,"Atmosphere great, singers animated and first rate. The program consisted of popular musical scores that were easily recognizable--a good idea for large audiences.The concert took off when the singers performed encores. It was at this point that the audience became enthusiastic and reacted accordingly."
2,For Elaine Stritch fans ONLY.,"This truncated, reorchestrated recording of the unsucessful 1954 revival of ""On Your Toes"" did absolutely nothing for me. The orchestrations are all wrong and the lyrics to some songs (noteably ""Too Good for the Average Man"") were unnecessarily changed to much weaker ones. Only Elaine Stritch singing ""You Took Advantage of Me"" (NOT from the original score) shines through. Contrary to what a previous poster said, this CD's recording of ""Slaughter on Tenth Avenue"" is NOT the longest possible version: The remastered 1983 revival recording's ""Slaughter..."" is SEVENTEEN minutes! In summary, if you're a fan of Elaine Stritch, buy this CD. Otherwise, the 1983 recording is preferable."
3,"Good, but...","I eagerly purchased this CD when it first came out. I didn't even know this recording existed. It was not the find I'd hoped for. All the performers are good, but underwhelming. The major turnoff is the sound. Tubby, low level, no dynamics, no mid-range at all. The performers are often drowned-out by the orchastra. It's sounds as if it was recorded at the bottom of a garbage can. Compare this with the terrific Pajama Game sound from the same year, and you'll think this is electronically re-channeled stereo from 1940. The 1983 revival and old columbia recording are better."

5,A Lost Gem!,"This out-of-print book is a rare treasure. Not only does it give first hand accounts of the turn of the Century's hunters, trappers, fishermen and guides of this region, but it describes the area in minute detail. To know that this area is more wild now than it was back then is truly exciting. If you've been there, this is your book."
1,What a twit,"I bought this book on the strength of my previous enjoyment of Oliver's Corinthian series and on the interesting premise of the ""dear Diary"" device. However - I'm surprised I bothered to finish it. I can't believe in a heroine who is such a twit, nor in her equally silly relatives - it's as if they didn't really ask her what happened to her at 15; in these day's of realism and with many other authors tackling difficult subjects, I would have found this plot a LOT more interesting and believable if anything bad had acutally happened TO Daphne, rather than her just witnessing something shocking to her upbringing and expectations. Plus Alexander is a real jerk with his search for ""beautiful"" women. I found I didn't care at all what happened to the two of them. I read this book to the end to find out what happened to the secondary characters (from previous Oliver books that I enjoyed).Don't waste your time and money on this one."
1,Not up to calibre,"I have to concur with the other reviews on this book. Daphne was a completely ninny, not at all up to the usual par of an Oliver heroine. I was vastly disappointed to see the story of Richard and Regina's brother, when their own stories had been so entertaining, be so bland and frankly stupid.The only part I really enjoyed was the competition between the expectant mothers, especially Regina."
2,disappointing,"When I saw Patricia Oliver had a new book coming out I couldn't wait to read it but this one is not up to her usual standards. As much as I hate to say it, this is one of the worst books I have read this year. It was a huge disappointment"
2,Can't get into this book,I am not even halfway through this book and can't take anymore. It starts off slow and there is no action. So far there has been no interaction with the victims of a crime and the characters are not very memorable. I keep waiting for it to pick up and get my attention.
4,A forgotten gem of pure reading entertainment,"If you are looking for a mystery/police procedural with a fascinating central character - Native American Detective Lucas Stonecoat, then look no further. CUTTING EDGE is it. With a violent and original plot, an atmosphere so thick you can cut it with a knife, this first entry in a four part series is a must for fans of Connelly, Sandford, Patterson, and McBain. The series only gets better with the second entry in the series,Double Edge (Edge Series #2), in which Walker introduces a character from his bestselling INSTINCT series into the mix, with great results. Highly recommended."
2,Cutting Edge #1,"The story had potential, much as the characters. But neither ever came to fruition. It was obvious that the writer couldn't even get inside the heads of his characters, so how he expected a reader to do so is beyond me. A good editor might be able to pull this from the scrap heap, because there are some good story elements worth salvaging. The grammer, spelling, and punctuation errors might have been caused by the conversion process, so I did my best to ignore them and am only mentioning them so future readers can be prepared. I will probably read the second in the series if only because I truly want to see this writer improve on the craft."
1,Not worth the time,"Skip the weird plot and just focus on the amatuer writing. Don't waste the storage space on this ebook. It was free, so you are getting what you pay for."
1,"RIDICULOUS PLOT,","This book shouldn't be included in the ""mysteries""genre; it's hilarious! The plot is absurd, the characters are so thin they are unbelievable. It is impossible to get interested; sure nobody expects fiction to be real-life stories, but good misteries must be at least BELIEVABLE. This book is AWFUL!"
5,Robert Walker has yet to drop the ball.,"I picked up Cutting Edge with a certain amount of trepidation. Walker was deviating from one of my favorite characters, Jessica Coran and I wasn't sure I was happy about it. Patricia Cornwell is one of my all time favorite authors, but her deviation from her Kay Scarpetta character in Hornets Nest was, in my opinion anyway disappointing. I do not wish for any author to become stuck in a ""character slot"", but oftimes, striking out into new directions can lead to loyal reader disappointment. Cutting Edge was successful beyond my hopes in creating new characters I could become hooked on. The plot never bogged down or predictable. His characters fresh, quirky, imperfect and all too human. I WANT MORE!! Kudos Mr. Walker!"
3,It was okay,"This is Barbara's first book. It is okay, but for a much better book on dealing with parrots, get her book ""Parrot Problem Solver""."
2,Don't bother to read; the information isn't worth the time.,"There is very little workable information in this book. When you have real problems with Greys and very large birds like MaCaws, you are dealing with large problems. This technique is not going to work. I should have saved my money and bought a new toy with it. Just as effective most likely."
2,content unoriginal,"Although the arrival/condition of the book was perfect, the content was very limited. I learned nothing new and feel I wasted my money. My parrot is still obnoxious. I had so hoped I would learn techniques to change his behavior."
2,Too different from the rest of the SAC soundtrack.,"I became a fan of Yoko Kanno, Tim Jensen, and the rest of the regular artists from the SAC soundtrack series. When I finally listened to ""Be Human"", I was very disappointed. It doesn't have the same feeling as the rest. It seems light hearted and not serious, unlike the dramatic tone found in the rest of the series.This album is about the Tachikomas. It contains some sound bytes of them, and the songs are either about or at least seem to go along with their personalties. The songs are cute and quirky, and I don't remember hearing most of them in the TV show.I knew that this album would be about the Tachikomas and therefor different form the rest of the series, however, I was not expecting it to be as different as it is. The mood and tone of the music is not what I typically like, nor does it seem to ""jive"" with the rest of the soundtrack.If you are a fan of Ghost in the Shell, be prepared for this CD before you buy it."
2,take a pass on this,"Nowhere near as good as the 1st two Ghost in the Shell SAC soundtracks, this one lacks any great vocal tracks, like Velveteen and Rise, and the non-vocals don't make me want to play this CD over and over again. As this CD is supposed to be from the Tachikomas' point of view I was hoping that the song that they sang when they sacrificed themselves at the 2nd seasons end would have been included in this CD. NOPE!!!"
1,NOT a real Ghost in the Shell Soundtrack.,"I was tricked into buying this Soundtrack because the label that keeps it sealed had ""Ghost in the Shell Soundtrack."" The problem is that nonoe of the music from the ""Stand Alone Complex"" series is on it. Most of the music is cheap techno, none of the good stuff from the series. The songs are thankfully short, but only one is even worth listening to. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ALBUM!"
4,Richard's Review,"Well Im a friend of Danny's so I have had the cd pretty much since he got it. I've listened to it many times and the one thing that is hard to believe is that the music came out of people who are that young. I mean the musicanship is great. The Vocals are the only thing that needs some work but other than that there would be a potential for them to go big. The classic rock early metal notes are great in comparison to some or the stuff out there, and its nice to year something differnet. Good luck at Bandfest."
2,Great at first...,"My daughter got this for Christmas last year. She really liked it at first, but after only a month of normal use it broke."
3,Torn between love and lust...,"This band is somewhat of an enigma. I mean, on the one hand, they have a song with an absolutely righteous title, ""I Am The Killer,"" but then in the song that goofy-toothed singer says,""I am no killer""??? Make up your mind, because I only listens to songs by hard rockers who aren't afraid to kill. Plus, I work for PETA, and I take offense to lines like, ""...and the morning dove gets caught in the telephone lines."""
4,A very well done album,"After ""Understanding in a Car Crash"" got some air time on MTV2, Thursday became one of the better known melodic hardcore bands out there. Though this may or may not be a good thing for the band, I can say that ""Full Collapse"" is an album that deserves the attention. This CD picks up where ""Waiting"" left off, though there is a bit more screaming this time around, showing that the band can mature but still maintain the same great style that has made them a success so far. I would say that there are two highlights when listening to ""Full Collapse."" The first is when you start listening to the music. The second is a few days later when you start putting together the lyrics and realizing just how much talent the band has. ""Autobiography of a Nation"" is a great example of this. The song itself is unbelievable, but once you understand what the lyrics are about it becomes much more powerful."
5,What's Better Than A Name Like Thursday??...,"When I listened to ""Understanding In A Car Crash"" I knew that I was automatically hooked. Thursday has a unique sound unliek anyone else. They're not like other bands that are inspired by certain bands and strive to make their sound similar to there idols. Thursday steps out and creates there own style while pulling other bands to follow."
5,An Excellent CD from Thursday,"This cd wasn't a favorite of mine at first, but it only took me a couple listens to see how great this band is. The lyrics on here are amazing. The vocals arent that outstanding, but they work the dual vocals excellently, and it doesnt really matter that theyre not excellent singers, because theyre good enough. My favorite songs on the album are understanding in a car crash, autobigraphy of a nation, and i am the killer. I like all the songs on here though. I definitely recommend this cd to anyone that likes this style of music."
4,Cant get much better,"Thrusday's "" Full Collapse "" is probably the best buy I have made in awhile. Their music combines styles already done but the unique thing is that they make it their own sound. Every song is strong and the vocals are amazing. While Geoff's voice soars, brutal screaming is laid out. I cant really compare them to another band. They DONT sound anything like Saves the Day for all you EMO kids...Thursday is alot harder..maybe best described as scrEaMO...a mix of great EMO vocals and music with hardcore sensabilites...do yourself a favor and pick it up!"
5,amazing album,"ive never heard of these guys until right before i bought the album. A friend suggested it, so i thought what the heck. When i popped it in i was driving home late at night and the whole album took me home. This is purely amazing, the emotions in Geoff's voice and the integration of the guitars, as well as the pounding bass give this album a great sound. Honorable mentions for songs to me would be a hole in the world, cross out the eyes, and i am the killer. This album is unique and wonderful. please buy it"
4,Very Good Sophomore Album,"This is not a earth shattering CD - However, it does help to redefine the emo and hardcore worlds. Thursday uses their instrumental skill and intense lyrical content to deliver a very intense emotional package. The background vocals - screams - give a brand new angle to the music, beyond just your everyday emo. It would be a 4 star CD, but the band tends to dwell on one sound throughout"
3,"some really good songs, yet some very bad songs!...","Ok this cd is good though the screaming can get annoying! Ok I know you are reading this and thinking the same thing as when I bought the cd ""They must just not like understanding in a car crash"" wrong that song rocks because the screaming actually fits into the song but then agin there are some songs that are good but the screaming doesn't fit. It is a good cd though I mean standing on the edge of summer, understanding in a car crash, and paris in flames are awesome and there are some other ok songs. Just so you are not disappointed try and get it on sale but still pretty good."
3,Does not meet the Standard,"Thursday has let me down. I was stoked to see them on Victory Records, but if this is the quality of music that I will be seeing from them in the future, then Thursday will end up dying. This album fails to follow up on their first album ""Waiting."" Granted ""Full Collapse"" has good songs, but Thursday has lost its creativity it was afforded as an underground screamo band. I just hope that Thursday can get back to its roots and write with emotion like Thursday once did."
2,Not worth the buzz,"I downloaded a couple songs before I bought the album and enjoyed what I heard so I went out and picked up the cd. Unfortunately whatever songs I downloaded didn't have the screaming and wailing so I wasn't prepared for the torture that I was about to be subjected to.The music itself is good, get rid of the screaming and I give it 4 stars instead of 2."
3,"Great music, but I just can't listen to it!","The music is good, it doesn't sound 100% original, but nowadays nothing does. The sound is, I guess, *deeper* than what I had expected, that is a good thing. The main (only) drawback is that I personally cannot stand the singers voice. I don't know if their a European band, but it kind of sounds like it. I'm not saying he isn't good, but it just irritates me listening to it. I can't listen to this CD without getting a headache. I don't know, maybe it's just me."
4,full collapse,"Full collapse is the most distinctive thursday album to date. 'understanding in a car crash' has a reflective feel to the on come of summer, the kind of song you watch the sun set too. with tracks like 'i am the killer' & 'paris in flames', you can tell this album is a hit."
5,Wide range and best of their releases,"Even though they have released two albums since Full Collapse, I still find myself coming back to Thursday's first major album. Full Collapse is just the most polished of the three, while War All The Time and A City By The Light Divided are much messier and much more charged emotionally. Full Collapse keeps the energy in check, and also encompasses a variety of different styles within the album. Each song is distinguishable, and thankfully Thursday had the mind to seperate the songs that were similar from each other on the album. That said, the tracks that stand out are the two singles: Understanding in a Car Crash, Cross Out the Eyes, and also A Hole in the World, Standing on the Edge of Summer, and Paris in Flames"
4,Screamee meemee,"I was not too familiar with Thursday, so I bought CD on a whim and because it was cheap. At first, I thought, what the hell is this?....put the screamer out of his misery so that I can hear the songs, which are very good. After several listens, there does appear to be a purpose to the ranting and I have gotten accustomed to it. If I had the technology, I would mute out the screaming just to see what the music sounds like without it. In lieu of this, I will say that I would buy another Thursday CD without pause."
5,A few choice words,"Heroin is one of the best bands I've ever listened to; if you want to hear screaming at it's best try and find some. Thursday makes me feel like I did when I first heard Heroin. I'm sure there are many people who would be mighty peeved to have someone link those two bands, but really, great music is hard to find!!!"
5,Best new pop/rock album in a long while,"I haven't felt this good about a new album since I picked up Sugar's first recording. Fresh, new, original, honest, resounding. By far the best CD I've picked up in a while. Ironically for a young band it almost has an 80's retro feel to it, but is really very contemporary. I can't stop listening to it."
2,great music!,"this band has great music, but the guy just CANT SING!! for me that ruins the whole thing. if there was some way to take him out and just listen to the band, then this would be worth it. but its not. so sad:("
1,UGH!!!!,"I'm sorry, but this cd seems like a waste of money and time. I wish the lead singer would pick a key and stay in it. And would someone please put that poor screaming man out of his misery? And mine as well? Some people I work with like it, but I just can't stand it. The guitar is great. The vocals are horrible and the screaming leaves a pounding in my head and my stomach churning."
2,haha,"I dont think that any band in history has ever taken themselves this seriously. If you're gonna act this pretentious, you might as well do something new besides dishing out the same watered down ""hardcore"" as a million other bands. If you want a cd that blows this out of the water, check out the shape of punk to come by refused."
1,The singer ....,"The guitar on this cd and the drums are good but i recommend u not buying this cd, because the singer ruins everything.When i heard it, i only heard the guitar and drums at first and loved it. But then this guy started to sing and u couldnt understand him, it was off pitch the whole time and the songs .... after that."
1,Best Review On Earth,"Hey ""World's Best Air Guitarist"" your review is the best I've ever read. :D Soooo appropriate"
5,Excellent,"I remember my friend told me to download ""Understanding in a Car Crash"" and I was instantly hooked. I immediately went to the store and bought Full Collapse. Emocore/Hardcore, whatever you want to call it, seems to gaining popularity these days. Thursday exceeds the other bands who fall into that genre. Geoff Rickly writes some amazing lyrics and screams with a lot of emotion. I bought this in 2001 and I am still listening to it now. I really recommned this album to anyone who enjoys good, emotional music. Oh and check out their prior release ""Waiting"" while you are at it. Thursday rocks!"
4,...,"Beauty mixed with rage. A perfect metephor for life in a society made of people you love doing things you hate. Reminds me of Cap'n Jazz, Braid, Grade and Stryder, maybe a little Refused, but better than all of them (except Cap'n Jazz of course) But Thursday shouldnt be categorized anyways. peace."
5,Thursday is the best new band out there.,"This CD really is incredible. Of all the music I listen to, I Am The Killer is by far my favorite song out there. This is not hardcore so don't get confused and make yourself look dumb. This is pure Emo Screamo. It's definitely worth the purchase. It sits in the car's CD changer as Disc 1 and will never leave it. I dare you to find a song that isn't good."
2,Eh.....,"Full Collapse is decent for what it is, but not essential by any means. Thursday is perhaps the best of what has been dubbed the ""mainstremo"" movement, and while their brand of stream-lined emocore is a nice respite from the slew of bad Blink 182 rip-offs, it's nothing special either. Some melodic guitar riffs here, a screamed chorus there, repeat. If this is your thing, I'm sure you'll enjoy it; it's not god-awful by any stretch. But this just doesn't move me anymore. I'd suggest you buy yourself a Jawbox record; it lasts longer."
5,Amazing,"Thursday is a very good band. This cd is perfect. Every song is awesome. The intro and outro add a nice effect to the overall mood of the cd. The songs jump from soft to hard in an instant. The guitars compliment each other, there are strong bass lines, sweet innovative drums, and Geoff (lead singer) has an amazing voice. This cd is the quintessence of what a good cd should be made of. The cd provides variety and every song is of equal importance."
5,Full Collapse,"This cd introduced me to Thursday and they are now one of my favorite bands. This cd is jam-packed with instant hits, but all the tracks grow on you the more you listen to them. Here is a rundown.1.A0001-intro2.Understanding in a Car Crash-10/10-amazing, first Thursday song I heard.3.Concealer-7/10-least fav, with so much emotion, this song doesn't take you as far as it should.4.Autobiography of a Nation-9/10-Sweet intro.5.Hole in the World-8/10-Sweet ending.6.Cross Out the Eyes-9/10-With songs like this, its hard to beleive Thursday stays relatively underground.7.Paris in Flames-9/10-the buildup and ending gives me chills every time.8.I am the Killer-11/10- fav.song., the chorus is so awesome.9.Standing on the Edge of Summer-10/10-the slowest song, and it works so well.10.Wind Up-9/10-Catches me off guard every time.11.How Long is the Night-10/10-over 5&1/2 minutes of bliss.12.I1100-10/10-I wish this song lasted longer, but it is a perfect closing track to a perfect album.Just buy it."
2,Seems to be lacking...,"A couple years ago, I had heard some good things from friends about Thursday. At the time I didn't pay much attention until to them until the release of War All the Time. When that came out I bought and enjoyed it so I decided to get Full Colapse. It seems like this one just isn't as good of a cd as their newest(although I am sure the fans would disagree). Despite Understanding in a Car Crash being a great song, the other ones seem too repetitive and bland so much so that I just haven't been able to get into to this cd at all. My advice is to get their newest release and to stay away from this one cause you're not missing much."
2,Stop screaming,"Thursday has a great sound, all rock and emotion. But I guess I'm just tired of the ""screaming as vocals"" aesthetic. Cut that out and I would have kept the album."
2,"Screaming, screaming, screaming...","I'm not a big fan of the insincere screaming in the background. I know the screaming is supposed to bring an intensity and emotion to the music, but it comes out of nowhere interrupting a perfectly good melody, and it all sounds the same. I would say they overkilled all the screaming, drop the cliche screams and you got a good album though..."
1,You're Better off with the single.,"Simply put: just buy the single for ""Understanding in a Car Crash."" The lead guitarist ruins so many songs with his brutal screaming that it takes away from every song on it. I honestly do not know how a good song like ""Car Crash"" got anywhere near the other tracks on ""Full Collapse."""
2,Please stop the screaming!,"This album had alot of potential, but the screaming just ruined it. It renders every song on this cd unlistenable. The mix between the Morrisey style singing and the background screaming goes together like a foot in the arse. Its like trying to watch an interesting movie with the vacum cleaner on in the background."
2,getting worse,"i don't think this cd's nearly as good as their old stuff- it's too produced and less passionate. they're way too preachy at shows too, and i've heard that most of them are jerks. the old album was great, though."
1,What's all the fuss?,"I don't understand the hype surrounding this band. All the songs on this album sound the same and the lead vocalist couldn't sing his way out of a wet paper bag. Whatever you do, don't believe that stupid label on the front of the CD that makes references to Robert Smith or Morrissey... whoever wrote that has severe hearing problems. My [money] would have been better spent had I simply rolled down my window and threw it into the street while doing 70mph down the freeway."
1,BURN WITH FIRE,"man, who would listen to this? the guy sings like he's going through perpetual puberty with the flu and a stomach virus and possibly the clap! his voice is just an abomination. the music, well the music is just bad. not standout bad, just good old fashioned bad. if only the bible had commandments against things like this, we would all be much better off. if you're going to listen to this kind of music, at least find someone who does it well."
1,WHY?,"I do not know where to begin to tell about my absolute hatred for this cd. I have to listen to it like basically every other day because of my girlfriend (she loves them). Every time it comes on I start to question if I should just blow my brains out. It's ok if you like it, I just think that it is one of the biggest pieces of crap to ever be produced. If it were up to me I'd throw the cd against a wall just to watch it break. Good thing I didn't have to pay for this abomination to the music world."
2,It;s OK...but.....,"I bought this cd shortly after its release. And honestly, I never have been able to get into it. I've tried many times. I'll put it in while im sitting at the computer and play the whole thing, but it never quite sticks. I do think its good though, but its like one of those movies that you watch and youre like ""well it was o.k."" but will probably never want to watch it again. Basically, to me, its not catchy. Also, the guy sounds to much like The Cure's vocalist, which gives all of the music a dark/gothic/depressing feel. My suggestion, check out two other bands, Emery and My Chemical Romance, they are very similar, in my opinion, to Thursday but make up for what Thursday is lacking."
4,Great Foot Rest,"Great Foot Rest! What was important to me was the fact the foot rest is not only sturdy, but durable. I have a two year old who tends to wonder into my home office and enjoys playing with my office stuff. Ensuring a product is not only durable but sturdy is very important to me. If it can hold up to my 2 year old, it's good for me!"
4,Good for the price,"The product is functional and does the job. Sure, there are some the are made better, but cost 3-4 times the price to do more or less the same thing, which is to give you something to rest your feet on at a better angle than the floor. Many of my co-workers have similar ones that they've had for years and have had no problem. In fact, this one seems to have smoother motion than some of the older ones. I'm happy with it, especially for the price."
2,Reasonable price but clumsy design,"I bought his footrest for the cheap price it was being sold at. Although it helps keep my feet at an elevated level, the incline is not at all smooth. A lot of times, I have tried to tilt it towards me and it just gets stuck, and when it does move, it does so with a jerk and comes down with a bang on the floor (I dont have carpet in my office). And thats a very startling sound, and now I am embarrased of moving it coz everyone turns to look! But it keeps my feet off the ground and helps my legs in the high heeled sandals. Get it if you dont want ot pay any more, but if you can affordto spend some more, go for somthing that rocks smoother."
1,Pick a different foot rest,"Flimsy plastic what a piece of junk. Not much else to say, don't waste your money on this!"
3,Takes pressure off knees,It does what I purchased it for which is to take pressure off my knees sitting at my desk all day. But it falls apart every time i move it and it's noisy plastic. My father made me a small padded stool for under my desk and I sold this at a yard sale.
4,Rests my feet,"I'm pleased with this purchase. I would have liked it to be priced less, but it's not overpriced. I didn't really need a foot rest that adjusts, but this one does. I like the textured surface. For bare or stocking feet, it feels good to run your feet across the top. In shoes, it doesn't matter. I'm petite so I need the added height for my posture to be correct while sitting at my desk. I would buy it again."
4,Fellowes Standard Foot Rest,Works for me! Great product for the price which was a good attraction for me. It is comfortable for me while sitting at my desk for long periods of time. Keeps my legs up instead of putting presser on the back of my knees from the chair causing my legs to go to sleep. It also keeps me from crossing one leg behind the other leg. I would recommend this to a friend.
3,Good Product for the $,This product is easy to move with your feet as well as adjust. It has grips that make it easy to keep your feet where you want them. There are 2 adjustable heights which are great. Under a conference table the higher adjustment is perfect for those long meetings. Under a desk the lower one is perfect. Great product for the $.
5,Does what it's intended to do,"I ordered this foot rest because it was the cheapest one I could find. For $20 I'm not disappointed at all. I have mine set up under my desk at work where it never moves, so I don't notice any faults in it at all. I believe while using this in combination with my new mattress, I've relieved a lot of my lower back pain. Any step is going to do the same thing, but this one is the cheapest one I found, so therefore the best in my eyes."
2,fine while it lasted.....,"The foot rest was at least as effective as a phone book (ie, it was okay but didn't hold adjustments) and better looking, until it broke completely after a few years. Now I'll just buy a different one that will last longer, and maybe even be more effective than a phone book."
3,Decent,"I purchased 3 different footrests of similar price to determine which one to buy for our company (we were looking to get about 25). This came in 2nd place, so we didn't buy more than the one we tested. It worked fine and was constructed well, just wasn't as sturdy as our final choice."
2,Mediocre,"Half-decent product. I bought this from Staples and it was overpriced. If you want something that will just work for a cheap price, then get it from Amazon. Basically, the foot rest only has two angles: low and high. The plastic foot rest is durable enough, but the pad it rests on is weak, especially the part where you adjust the angle height. A major irritant for me was that the foot rest easily flops forward and back, making a noisy clunk sound even on carpet. I used this for barely two years and one of pad's parts has already cracked. Invest in a higher quality product with more more options for angle adjustments."
3,Ok Ok.,I didn't liked the way it moves and not stay in steady position.Also not good for shorter people.comfort is OK.
4,Works well,"This footrest works well, and the rotating action is a nice added bonus. I will be buying a second one for the other side of my desk soon."
2,"For the price, get something else","Luckily I got this for free from work, but also means they got me the cheapest thing they could afford.I would not recommend anyone paying >$10 for this. Its very plastic, it doesn't roll smoothly or adjust well.Its movements are very stiff. The little knobs that it ""rolls"" on broke off, so it moves even worse now. Also, its hard to get it to the right spot/height, and once you do get it ""right"", it moves.also it is very loud, every time it moves, bang! Bang!for the price @$17-20, there are much better footrests out there."
2,Loud cheap plastic,This thing is hallow cheap plastic and it doesn't weight much. On my hardwood floor every time I touch or move it it makes a ton of noise. It may stay put better on a carpet floor but it would be a cool product if it were rubberized and heavier maybe.
3,would try another next time,"Works well for the price but would not get another. The two parts that join fall apart rather easy. Plastic is sturdy, but not very confortable. For the price its still a good buy."
5,Fellowes Standard Foot Rest,"I love it I noticed that other co workers in the office had sometype of foot rest, so I decided to get one and it is one of the best investments I have made, decreased swelling in lower extremeties, also gives me a chance to exercise while sitting at the desk...."
3,a little bulky,"I can't push my chair in as far as I like, but I'm short and it gives my legs enough height"
1,Like resting your feet on a small mountain of plastic trash,"What more can I say than the above? It is flimsy, doesn't stay in adjustment, rattles around when you move, and looks cheap to boot. Don't waste your money, this thing is junk. It would be more appropriately priced at $5.00."
2,Not smooth and feels cheap (is cheap).,Tilting the foot rest back and forth is not the easiest thing in the world. It's just cheap plastic rubbing on cheap plastic so it sticks a lot. Mine broke in 2 different spots within a month...
2,"Cheap product, agree with Calhoun","I agree with Mike's review. The product is cheaply made. If you fidget your legs or feet like I do, the footrest's adjustable slide can't handle the pressure. One side's connector broke on me a year ago, and the other side just broke on me tonight.Look for a better quality rest than this one."
4,Excellent book,Very informative and accessible. Detailed overview of the life-cycle and behavior of this magnificent bird. Lots of great pictures. Includes descriptions of places where you can see hundreds of hawks during their migratory season!
3,jukebox lil reissue,"These recordings were previously issued on lp by the Jukebox Lil record label, and while the music is typical Big Joe Turner, the sound is a bit rough. A lot of the songs were taken from old 78's and you tend to get some surface noise. But it's 40's Big Joe and worth a listen."
5,Too pretty to cook with!,"I was a bit leary ordering this cookware without being able to actually hold it in my hands. I did anyway. It arrived and I was pleasantly surprised. It is great quality cookware. Very heavy, beautifully made. It looks so pretty hanging on my pot rack. I just may have to buy another set to cook with! ;) I think the price was excellent and the free shipping makes this deal even sweeter! Want cooper cookware? Get this set."
4,It's good.,"This book covers a good deal of the critical problems that a painter interested in representational depiction of color (still life, figurative, landscape, etc.) will need to experience in order to train their eye.What this book does not cover is anything regarding design, composition, keying a painting, limited palettes, etc. I would also have like to have seen more on brushwork, there is really only one project that mentions that at the very end. The rest of the book involves working strictly with a palette knife or trowel, and while that's a great way to learn to use that tool, it does forgo the opportunity to show people how brush and knife can be combined to achieve techniques that cannot be done by either alone."
3,I normally LIKE best hits albums. NOT of the HOOTERS,"That's right! There's Too Many ""Best Hits Collections"" of these guys. At last count there were more collections of Hooter songs than original albums issued. That's just plain WAKED. I suggest buying ""zig zag"", ""Nervous Night"" and ""One Way Home"" via the used venue here on amazon. This way you own ALL of the great music & YOU decide what their best hits are for yourself, don't let some record industry suit do it for you."
3,it's cheaper & less hastle to buy all three original CDs,"That's right! There's Too Many ""Best Hits Collections"" of these guys. At last count there were more collections of Hooter songs than original albums issued. That's just plain WAKED. I suggest buying ""zig zag"", ""Nervous Night"" and ""One Way Home"" via the used venue here on amazon. This way you own ALL of the great music & YOU decide what their best hits are for yourself, don't let some record industry suit do it for you."
5,magnificent,"Truely magnificent, this soundtrack is 21 songs of work of art, very uplifting, feel good music that acompany the film perfectly."
3,Not Quite What you may be expecting,"This is more than adequate as far as film soundtracks go, but I could not help but be disappointed by the fact that Philip Glass's works really represent half of the recording, if that much and seems to be a collection of work from other recordings. Some of them, at first glance, seem borrowed from other films.I am a big fan of Philip Glass and bought this CD under the impression that this was a new collection of original work; my mistake perhaps, but those loooking for the same may be better off buying the soundtracks to Anima Mundi and Powaqqatsi.Nonetheless this particular soundtrack may be worth its cost for a collection of interesting music and sound bites from an interesting film"
4,A moving and satisfying musical portrait.,"The soundtrack to THE TRUMAN SHOW is a patchwork quilt featuring music from Dallwitz, Glass, Kilar, even Chopin. Primarily composed by Dallwitz and Glass, somehow this all comes together into a satisfying whole. The clever, TV show within a movie, benefits from this dual use of composers. When you see it again, notice how the music of Dallwitz underscores the film. Its the music chosen by director Peter Weir to score his film. Then, notice how most of Glass' music is used to score the ""TV show."" This is music chosen by director Christof to score the ""show."" Quite a clever and not an as obvious as it might seem concept. The inclusions of the Chopin piece and the music by Kilar are to be appreciated. All in all, one of the better soundtracks of the year."
5,quite possibly the best movie soundtrack ever,"The Truman Show soundtrack is a genius composition of many different styles and works. From the short but sweet 'It's a life' to (what's debatably the best track) 'Dreaming of Fiji, not to mention some other highlights; Anthem, Living Waters, and A New Life."
5,Love this little iXO,"This is just the cutest little thing. I was attracted to it because of the length of time it is supposed to hold it's battery life. I have a larger Craftsman screwdriver which always runs out of juice by the time I need to use it. That is frustrating. I am not a handyman, or service person. I am a homeowner who has very occasional need for a powered screwdriver. For anything bigger than this tool -- I call in my handyman Jim to do the work. It's probably beyond me anyway.This has a cool little carrying case and stores easily. Don't expect it to work as strongly as a drill does or a larger powered screwdriver ... you'll probably burn the motor if you do. Personally, I am still trying to find it's sweet spot. The good thing is -- I know it will have power when I need it. Cool stuff!"
5,Great tool!,"This is a great tool that delivers. I like the fact that it is compact, not noisy and quite pleasant to handle. My older drill died and I needed to replace it. I was afraid that this skil would be too small and not have enough power. Boy, was I wrong. Don't get deceived by its mini size. With this new one any work is just a breeze."
5,Great for what it does,"This is my 3rd driver. The first model had a poor design for the direction button. My medium sized hands would push the button when I gripped the handle. Then, after only 2 years or so the charger died. Bought one as a gift and a new one for myself. I use the new charger for both of my drills.Small and compact it has an amazing amount of torque. I carry one in my briefcase and use it frequently on computers and various other projects. The other is at home handily in a drawer for quick access for the little jobs around the house. I have also used this in tight quarters (couldn't get my big drill in there)to drive self tapping screws through sheetrock into steel studs. Didn't think it had the power but was pleasantly surprised as I drove about a dozen or so screws.This drill isn't a replacement for a 3/8"" or 1/2"" drill but is a very handy tool to have around for doing the ""light stuff"" around the house and shop."
3,Would not buy again....,"Hi,This handy little gadget gets the job done BUT has it's faults....I've only used it a few times for simple projects, and several times during the job, the bit would simply fall out on the floor. I found this very annoying and disruptive to my work as I had to then search around on the floor for the bit. Also, it comes with many screwdriver bits - but only one drill bit, which is quite small. I should have taken this more into consideration when I ordered the product.I had an older version of the Denali 3.6-Volt cordless screwdriver/drill prior. It came with 5 various size drill bits and enough screwdriver bits for my household use. We received it as a housewarming gift when we moved into our new home. After six years of good use, it simply fell apart. That being said, however, I really enjoyed it's reliable performance over the years, and I now wish I had ordered another Denali instead of this Skil. I am getting my brother the Denali for Christmas."
2,Get the Black & Decker version,"This device is functional but not else. The forward/reverse button is in a terrible place. I can't tell you how many times I've hit it on accident and screwed the wrong way.It should have been placed on the top. The most damaging flaw is the fact that chuck will not stay still when you try to remove a stubborn screw. The chuck will just keep turning and will not get the screw stared. The drill usually doesn't have enough strength to break a screw on it's on so you have to manually turn the driver, but the chuck will not hold still to do it. Once you do get a screw started it does fine. I would not recommend this drill if you use it on a daily basis like I do. However if you use it occasionally around the house it is a decent drill. I would recommend the black and decker version of this drill. I had it before this drill and it is a much better drill. I wish I would have purchased it again."
1,Junk,Won't ever buy another product by Skil. They barely outlast the warranty and the performance is second to just about everything out there. Save yourself some money and buy something else rather than replacing a Skil every year.
5,Small Cordless Screwdriver With Big Results,"I bought this cordless screwdriver after reading several positive reviews on Amazon. I immediately put it to work screwing in about 60 #10 2"" and 2 1/2"" screws into 1 1/2"" thick redwood. It drove the screws in, slowly but surely, with no failed attempts and battery power to spare. While it may be small and lightweight, it has good power and the battery definitely goes a long way on a charge. This cordless screwdriver is a good value at less than $25!!!"
4,Great fix-it tool,"Purchased for use around the house and have been very pleased with performance and features. Perfect for home repairs and maintenance, plenty of power for general household use. Compact and convenient as well. Only flaw is directional slide switch is not firm enough and can be moved too easily. I have used for small pilot hole drilling as well with hex-shanked bits - works fine in soft woods and walls etc."
3,2 Bits!!!,"The product is just like the one I lost in the flood but, it only comes with 2 bits! The pixs shows the complete set that I originally bought in the store but, that's not what you get. I like the little screwdriver and it really comes in handy for any type of job!"
3,Good but not great...,"I work on copiers for a living and remove and install machine screws with this screwdriver. This is a good little screwdriver, but I also own a similar sized Black and Decker that is quite a bit better although just a little bit larger. Both have the same size battery, but the B&D has quite a bit more torque and seems to hold a charge longer. This is really nicely sized and easy to operate, but I also know that there is a similarly sized and priced screwdriver that is quite a bit more rugged."
1,Died in 2 weeks,"I used this card in my Panasonic HDC-SD5 camcorder for a week for testing before the Christmas party. It worked fine for that week, but saddly it started to give error during recording at the party on tripod mount. I turned off the camcorder and turned it back on, the camcorder says ""Reparing Data"", and after a minute it starts to record for few seconds and then ""Card Error"" appears again. After that, the card complete died on me. The card now doesn't read by usb card reader anymore. I tested the camcorder with Sandisk card and worked fine but as soon as I popped this one in, ""Card Error"" appears and wouldn't record. Its life span was only a little more than a week. I wish A-Data has better quality control before releasing this to the public. Should've spend more money to get a better card. The money saved wasn't worth the video lost. Lesson learned."
1,Wish I could give it ZERO stars. Defective on arrival,"Paid $63 plus shipping. Put it in new camera, and it displayed a CARD ERROR. Other SDHC cards worked perfectly in the camera. Tried the ADATA in another digital camera that accepts SDHC cards and also got a CARD ERROR message. Would not respond to a format command either. Didn't show up when I put it in a USB attached SDHC card reader on the computer.Perhaps some people had better luck, but the company obviously doesn't test these cards before they send them out."
4,It is a very nice product ..but is slow,"I bought this SD card to use in my D80 Nikon SLR Camera. I took 3 shoots and the card is slow....just a little bit. I swap to my other card , Sandisk Extreme III, 2 GB...and the Sandisk performance is much better. I do not agree with other customer opnion because is very clear at description that card is SD HC (high capacity) and it is not compatible with a lot of equipaments...i going to try to use it ...and i hope that card increase the write velocity...."
1,BEWARE OF THEMEMSTORE,"Buyers should be aware that TheMemstore lists items for sale on Amazon which they do not have in stock. If you don't mind waiting a few extra weeks to get your product, their prices are good. Hopefully you will not have to deal directly with them for anything. I received an Amazon shipping confirmation with a USPS tracking number, but 3 weeks after Amazon sent me the tracking number USPS reports that TheMemstore has not actually shipped anything yet. All they did was download a tracking number."
1,Doesn't work for long!,I bought the 4GB version of this card for my new Kodak Z1275. It worked great at first - I could take over 1000 12mpx shots....but then for no reason I noticed my count changed to like 85. I took the disk home and put it in my computer - It shows two things: 1) there is nothing on the disk - all files have been removed 2) there is only 8% capacity left.I have NO idea what happened....but now it's worthless..
1,Buyer beware,"First I must say, the item probably works just fine, but for a non-techie like myself, SD, means, SD. I had no idea that SDHC is not at all compatible with SD. I opened the package, and began to format the card, it froze my computer numerous times. My complaint is, no where on this web site regarding SDHC does it mention it's compatibility. Also, Hitech, the affiliate of Amazon, has been slow to respond to issue an RA number."
5,Wonderful,"This a terrific book written by a courageous and talented writer. Those who point out how spoiled Rosemary Breslin is are missing the point. Rosemary Breslin is explaining how she changed and grew, in spite of, and perhaps because of her illness. The other thing that changed Breslin was her devoted husband, who taught her the meaning of unconditional love. This is a book I will remember for a long time. I hope Ms. Breslin writes many more."
5,Not Exactly What I Had In Mind,"This book has stuck with me for so long...Rosemarys courage, humor and determination are inspiring! I would love to know if she is ok today and if she is or has written anything else?"
3,Not as durable as advertised,"These are nice glasses. They fit two large 2"" ice cubes just right. I'm not sure how ""thermo"" they are.But, I broke one the first time I used it. It slipped off a table onto a carpeted floor. It was nearly empty but had two large ice cubes. The glass broke from the inside, presumably from the ice cubes. I'm still a little leery of breaking them when putting ice cubes in them. Will the cube drop down and break the glass?Update (two weeks later): Now the other one has broken. My son put (dropped?) an ice cube in the glass and the bottom broke. I'd change my opinion from ""nice"" to ""dangerous"" glasses. What if you didn't notice the bottom was broken and started drinking?"
2,What? I still need a coaster?,"Such a cool design... And I loved the weight of the glass and appreciated the heftiness they had over Bodum... But my whole reason of getting these was to avoid the condensation on the glass. I ended up having to wipe down the glass and grabbed a coaster, grrrrr."
3,Exploding glass,"I've had these glasses for a few months. I've enjoyed not having to use coasters when I put them down, even with iced drinks inside. However, recently I slipped an ice cube into one and ""POW"", the inner wall exploded. Mind you, I didn't drop an ice cube in, I slid it down the inner wall of the glass. So... buyer beware... these are great glasses but, perhaps the better practice is to put the liquid in first, followed by the ice."
3,Okay but not what was expected,Glasses were not the size expected. Do not have a good feel. Rarely if ever use them unless there is a shortage of other glasses which almost never occurs.
5,Wonderful galsses,"These glasses are super strong, 20 oz non sweat glasses! If you are looking for glasses that will not destroy your end tables? This is the perfect product for you! Keeps hot beverages hot and cold beverages cold. My partner left her glass in her car in the summer in Orlando FL and when she returned from shopping, (over 2 hrs) it still had ice in the glass!"
3,I like them but one imploded just sitting there at room temp.,"I like them but one imploded just sitting there at room temp. It was like a firecracker and everybody in the house jumped, fortunately all shards were contained by the outer layer. It held some 40F milk an hour ago, I drank it and the spoon was sitting in it, otherwise empty for an hour. I had it for 2 months. I'll keep using my remaining glasses unless one breaks the outer layer by itself.edit: Well now the second 20-oz glass developed a couple of cracks in the outer layer, so it too is retired to the dump. It was 3 months in my care and I don't think it was abused. Too bad, I don't think I can even recycle borosilicate glass like this. I suppose I could have tried to get a refund or replacement.I have a pair of similar smaller 16-oz glasses still intact after about a year, and I still like them too."
2,"Nice, but one broke when I added ice.","These are nice tumblers, a bit difficult to keep looking clean, not sure why. I had been using them for months, and then one day I took one from the cabinet and added some ice, then *pop*, the ice shattered the inside glass while I was holding it. I understand the idea of thermal shock, but the glass was not even hot (or warm), this should not have happened. I will probably get some more since they keep drinks cold, but I don't think I will be buying these again.Update: Well I bought another set and lost another glass, this time in the dishwasher. Gotta think they could design these a bit better so they don't just 'splode"" at the slightest disturbance in temperature. They do keep stuff cold though, just be careful, and then expect them to blow up even then."
2,Hard to clean,These cups are so tall and the aperture so narrow my hand won't fit more than half-way down so I can't reach the bottom to clean them. When I put hot beverage in it there is not much insulation. The outside of the glass gets very hot quickly and gets uncomfortable to hold. Also they are heavy and the grip is not very tight so there is a fear of dropping it if you don't set it down on a table while you are using it.
1,Broke in less than 2 months of receiving them,Broke in less than 2 months of receiving them. It was very disappointing considering how expensive they were.
4,Sun's Tea 20oz Double Wall Glasses are a nice addition,"Although I've not had these too long, I've already enjoyed them loads. Because of the double wall and thermo ""vacuum bottle"" properties, the exterior of the glasses stays at a comfortable temperature. Most important to me, the glasses never ""sweat"" or have exterior condensation. No more rings on furniture! No more coasters sticking to the glass when you pick it up. I'm certain that as the weather warms, these glasses will be appreciated even more. So, coming up on a wedding or anniversary and looking for a useful, unique gift? Look no farther. These are ideal for a couple, young or old and will be appreciated and enjoyed."
3,average,I bought these glasses to keep my drinks as cold as possible as long as possible.I've had some coors double walled glasses which when held with a cold drink the outside is room temperature.Holding these glasses the outside is cold. If the outside of the glass is cold then the glass really isn't working as well as it should. Of course it's better than a normal glass but as a double walled glass to keep your cold drink longer it's average.
2,One broke after a month,The glasses keep things cool for awhile but I had one break already by washing it. Kind of disappointed that it broke so soon.
2,MISLEADING & FRAGILE,"WHEN I BOUGHT THESE GLASSES IT READ TUMBLERS , DURABLE , THICK GLASSES. THIS IS NOT THE CASE . ALTHOUGH THE THERMAL DUAL WALL OF THE GLASS MAINTAINS THE COOLNESS OF THE LIQUID WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE TEMPERATURE DESPITE EXTERNAL THERMAL CHANGES THE GLASS ITSELF HAS SOME SERIOUS AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS FLAWS. FOR EXAMPLE DO NOT PLACE ICE INTO GLASS WHEN GLASS IS IN WARM OR ROOM TEMPERATURES THE CHANGE OF TEMPERATURE WILL SHOCK THE AIR PRESSURE OR GASSES WITHIN THE GLASS WALL CAUSING YOUR GLASS TO SHATTER FROM THE TEMPERATURE CHANGE!!!! YOU DO NOT WANT TO RISK YOUR SELF OR LOVED ONES WITH THAT EVENT WHEN TRYING TO OFFER THEM AN INNOCENT GLASS OF WATER OR ANY OTHER BEVERAGE!!! BEWARE THE TEMPERATURE OR THERMO WALL IS EFFECTIVE BUT FAR TOO THIN FOR AVERAGE USE. IT IS QUITE DANGEROUS AND SUDDENLY SHATTERS WHEN EXPOSED TO ICE."
4,"sturdy, but...","I own another series of insulated glasses which is no longer available, and I was attracted to these because the others are quite fragile and noticeably lower capacity. The description of these says they are sturdy enough to drop ice into the bottom from several inches above the lip. I have no doubt that's true. However, the thick glass that makes them more durable also hinders their ability to insulate. I find that my thin delicate glasses will NOT sweat (I even drink my coffee in them) but these will sweat in the heat and humidity of summer, although nowhere near as much as regular glasses, maybe 10 or 15% as much. All in all, I would rather have the thin glass unless I had kids or if I didn't wish to be careful with the glasses. In any case, I am definitely addicted to insulated glasses...I drink everything out of them now."
1,Gorgeous ¡FRAGILE! Sun's Tea 20oz ¡FRAGILE! Ultra Clear ¡FRAGILE! Double Wall ¡FRAGILE! Thermo Glasses,"I really like these glasses. They are ultra clear and look great.They are not light weight, and feel good and substantial in the hand.The set of two I purchased didn't last long, however.A couple of ice cubes dropped into the glass caused the inside to shatter.In a clumsy moment, I dropped the other a few inches onto the kitchen counter.The inside of the glass shattered.I'm not a structural glass engineer, but my guess is thatthe inside of the glass was not properly heat treated."
2,Disappointed,I thought Double wall glasses should not sweat these do and they are a bit heavy-Good size-not dishwasher safe-durable-
4,"okay, but not as nice as Bodum","These are good for double-wall glasses in a larger size, but frankly, they look like flower vases. They are a little ""clunky"" and thick, particularly at the rim. I suppose, however, this makes them sturdier than Bodem, which is a big plus."
3,Sun's Tea vs Bodum,Purchased 20oz and 14oz glasses to see if these would more durable than Bodum. They are definitely more stout at first glance.Pros: Not as fragile as BodumCons: Lip is thick and not comfortable. Thicker glass does not insulate as well as Bodum. Glass filled with ice and drink will still sweat and a coaster is needed. This is not the case with Bodum.I am sure I will get used to the thicker lip but I am disappointed that glass still has condensation.
4,Sun Tea 20 oz double wall glasses are great.,"I have been using these 20 oz double glasses for about two years. They are sturdier than another brand(Boden). That being said, they are glass and do break, but not easily. They keep drinks cold and do not get condensation rings on furniture. I ordered more for myself and for gifts."
2,Loved These Until...,"I loved these glasses. I'm using past tense because they both broke in less than a month. The first one stirring with a spoon and the second one setting it down on a table. The size and shape of these was perfect but normal use will destroy them. Maybe if you can be incredibly careful to avoid ice and spoons and only set them on soft coasters you'll have better luck. If you hear a pop and see your drink develop an odd layering effect, that's how you know the liner has blown. There will be pieces of glass in your drink. Be careful!"
3,Good at first but blew up later,"I had these for almost a year. Just today I went to put some ice in one and it made a loud bang, the inside bottom blow out. I think the inside is in vacuum. I wasn't rough with it. I don't like how it blew up, probably not the safest thing. I don't know if I would buy these again."
3,"Very nice to look at, but mine haven't performed so well","I've had my tumblers for a few months. They look great, and they've performed only ""OK"". We're seeing the glasses sweat with no visible signs of breakage. We haven't dropped or aggressively handled the glasses, so maybe I just got a bum pair. Obviously, with the sweat, the insulation isn't doing a great job of keeping the liquid's temperature.The product is weighty ... feels very sturdy and comes with a bit of heft. The glasses look great, and I truly wish their performance matched. Again, maybe I just got a pair of lemons. I will likely give Sun's Tea another chance with a different product in the (very) near future."
3,Fragile NOT strong,"Bought these glasses about 9 months ago and they are great for hot and cold beverages, you don't need a coaster. BUT, they are the most fragile drinking glasses I've owned, like wine glasses. We have broken these glasses by putting silverware in them and tipping them over on a granite counter; events other non-""strong"" glasses have survived. Calling them ""strong"" is just puffery, they aren't at all strong and they should be at this price. Also, the wide rim makes them like drinking out of a thick mug."
2,Exploded!!!,I really liked them till they Exploded. Had several months and added Ice to a glass of water and BOOM! inside blew up.
1,Good until they exploded (one by one),"I purchased four of these. Three exploded in the span of a couple months, the last one cracked after it was accidentally tipped over. They're just incredibly fragile!"
2,Exploded,"Had one explode on me. Not sure what happened- I set a spoon in one (gently set it, didn't drop it), and at the instant the metal touched the glass the inner wall gave off a loud concussive POP and exploded. It was kind of cool actually. Everything stayed contained inside the outer wall, so it was easy to clean up. I'm in Denver, so the outside air pressure is likely lower than than the air that was trapped inside these glasses when they were manufactured- I'm guessing that's what gave off the pop.Anyway, these are indeed heavier than the Bodum glasses, but so far they are breaking for me at exactly the same rate. Also the top rim is very thick, which makes it awkward to drink from. The glass quality isn't that great either- a lot of ripples, and the inner section isn't centered in the outer glass very well."
1,Buyer Beware!,"These glasses were awesome for a couple of months, then they started exploding. It sounds like a gunshot! Today, my fourth one exploded as I was taking my last drink of iced tea. I felt the pressure hit my face. It's a wonder that the small pieces of glass didn't hit me in the face. I had purchased 16-20 oz. glasses and 8 of the smaller ones. After this last explosion, they all went to the trash. I was afraid to give them away for fear that they would hurt someone. The need to be much thicker so they won't explode! The don't sweat and they keep your drink cold, but they are seriously dangerous! Beware!"
5,No puddles please!,"Nothing irritates me more than finding a glass sitting on nice furniture surrounded by a Puddle of condensation. I can't change people but Sun's Tea insulated glasses have pre-solved that problem in my house. Plus they are very handsome to look at. Hot or cold, it keeps the inside temperature of the drink --on the inside -- how nice is that? I bought only two just to see if they were all they promised and so far, they are! Here's hoping my glasses last a long time. Thanks again, Amazon, for being a great place to shop for a zillion subjects and things!"
1,STRONG DOUBLEWALL THERMO,"I bought these glasses to put my diet A AND W ROOTBEER WITH ICE in the glasses, because they said they don't sweat. But if you leave you glass set for awhile, these glasses get condinsation on the outside of the glass.I DON'T RECCOMMEND VTHESE GLASES, BECCAUSE THEY DO SWEAT. But these gasses a heavy in weight, they are made good, but the get condinsation, if they set for awhile.Jim in Ohio"
2,too fragile,They all broke within 8 months of purchase date (we purchased 6 glasses). I was very disappointed with this product.
4,Brings back memories,I always enjoyed these shows as a young girl and they are still funny to me. I think Gale Storm was very cute and funny. Very enjoyable DVD.
5,Love it,"My daughter got this as a birthday gift (6 years old). It was her favortie gift. She loves it. It was a little hard for her to manipulate the pieces and click them together but once she got the hang of it, she was fine. Santa will definately be bringing more for Christmas!"
4,A tribute to Hondo..,"This second disc is a must have companion to the first... Basically a tribute to Hondo Crouch, the late ""owner"" of Luckenbach. A live album with one of the best renditions of ""L.A. Freeway"" he's ever recorded and the ""Sea Cruise Medly"" is not to be missed! If you're a JJW fan, you need both volumes of this album."
5,Empowering!,"Hooray! This CD is exactly what woman and teenage girls need. As an educator I see many teenagers fighting with the concept of ideal body image as portrayed by the advertisements they are bombarded with daily. The industry has truly created victims out of many teens and women alike. Tina's CD is the answer to my prayers. It empowers me to accept who I am as an individual and what is best for my body. I listen to the CD at night and it allows me to completely relax and fall asleep. Throughout the day I find myself more aware of what I am eating. I also feel very rested and my mind is clearer, allowing me to rejuvinate and heal from within. I can focus on feeling empowered and food is no longer my escape. Thanks Tina. Your CD is a wonderful gift for anyone, young or old, struggling with body image and weight management."
2,"HORRIBLE, ANNOYING music at the end ruins it","I had really high hopes for this cd based on the earlier reviews. Unfortunately, I now wish I'd bought something else.In general I liked the message, although it was a little ""new-agey"" for me. The soft music in the background is nice; somewhat like those pictures with another picture hidden if you stare long enough. Saachi's accent and some grammatical errors (or cd skips?) were somewhat distracting, but I could get past that. But then, I got the end of the cd. First of all, it would be nice if it contained some messages for the listener to ignore the waking commands if he or she had fallen asleep. Even that I could deal with. But the HORRIBLE, ANNOYING, UNBEARABLE music at the end totally ruined any state of relaxation I had achieved, making the whole cd totally useless for me. What a waste of $25."
5,Love this CD,I love this CD. It helped me get over my cravings for sugar and bread. I do need to listen to the CD on a regular basis (weekly) to keep these thoughts in my subconscious mind. I love getting a hypnotherapy session whenever I want and at my convenience.
2,"I shall wait and see, but in the meantime...","I am really surprised at all the positive reviews - which is why I bought this. The voice is soooo irritating and DOES NOT soften at all throughout the entire thing. In fact, in some parts the voice gets louder and then calms down again - which is so jarring. I only listened to it today, and I can only hope that it works. Also, that music at the very end - WHAT IS THAT ALL ABOUT? It woke me up in such a way. Is this reverse psychology at work? I advice the good doctor to get some advice on how to mix audio, and I can't say it has convinced me to buy any of her other works."
2,Techno music jarring and hideous wakes you up at end!,"I really liked this CD and I was able to ""go deep"" the first time listening. I put it on at bedtime and almost fell asleep. At the end though, she goes through a waking up routine (""You feel more energetic, your ready to wake up feeling refreshed, etc"") which brought me slightly back, and means it's not a good bedtime routine which is unfortunate for me as that's the time I have dedicated to this project. And then, after waking you up... BAM! this weird, awful TECHNO mixed with Halloween music starts, and it's quite loud compared to the volume her voice was at. Talk about every cell in my body getting TWANGED and irritated!I really wish I would have seen the other person's review about the ending music. It's horrible. The worst atonal music I've ever heard, at the worst moment possible. Yuck."
3,Weight Lose CD Review,"I thought the CD was very relaxing. It helped me for a couple of days, then I would just listen to it again. I guess I was hoping it would be stronger for me. I've never used hypnotherapy before. If you are easily hypnotized then I'm sure this method would be even better. I'm pretty stubborn and skeptical. I need something more direct like ""Put the fork down CD"" or ""I do not need food to be happy CD"". Anyway, I hope you enjoy!"
2,Something wrong with me?,"This product got great reviews which I look at before buying anything anymore. I think I have a hard time relaxing to the hypnosis level. Tina's voice was very soothing and motivating, but at no point did I feel like she was talking to my subconscious. I cannot acheive this deep relaxation while doing yoga either, too hard for me to let go of everything around me and all lifes distractions. My advice is if you have a hard time ignoring the dog barking, your neighbors lawnmower and your husbands football party in the basement, and blocking everything out this CD is going to do nothing more for you than motivate, definetly not hypnotize."
5,"It works! Must have Belief, Desire & Intention. It works!","This is a teamwork effort. It's not a magic wand. One must understand that your responsibility is to exercise and eat right. Then allow this cd to help you on a subconscious level. Your subconscious mind is where your patterns and behaviors are stored. This cd will lead you to deprogram the behaviors and patterns. Join Tina as she guides you through this empowering weight management hypnotherapy session, where you decide to create the body you want. Whether you want to lose, gain or maintain weight, this innovative program will help you let go of harmful behavior patterns at the subconscious level, where all healing takes place. By inviting your heart and spirit into your journey, Tina shows you that it's about the emotional connection you have with food. Guiding the power of your intention, Tina helps you get to the root of these patterns and permanently release them in the quest for your birthright: the body you deserve."
2,Stereo versions of most of their songs,"Your better off getting the Rhino collection as it is in mono. This CD is in stereo and is more of a curio. The songs have no power in stereo and sound like different mixes. By the way, no comp by the Kingsmen includes the single mix of ""Little Latin Lupe Lu"". That version has dubbed in percussion and guitars and the vocals are higher in the mix. Unless your a stereo fanatic, don't buy this one."
5,A fantastic read!,"I highly recommend this book. Especially interesting Rangers or soon to be Ranger candidates.Read the day to day activities, night operations and tough moments of Ranger school from a new perspective. I couldn't put this book down!"
1,If you loved Hee Haw this is right up your corn row,"Another silly downhome approach to lifes complex issues like, cheatin' drinkin' and four wheelin'. Ridicously simple and yet overbearing. The I.Q. allowable for maximum enjoyment of this record should not exceed 72."
5,Essential Collection,"This is a collection of Wynonna's biggest hits since 1992 (up until 1997), she has had quite a few in that short time. Her beautiful voice which is sometimes fierce and fiery, but also shows compassion and strength and beauty, all at once. She is one true country diva that others could learn a thing or two from. She's right up there with the other divas: Trisha Yearwood, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Reba McEntire, etc etc. Wy gets upbeat on songs like ""Rock Bottom"", ""Tell Me Why"", ""Girls With Guitars"", ""No One Else On Earth"", ""I Saw The Light"" etc. And she shows her tender side on ballads like ""Heaven Help My Heart"", ""Only Love"", ""She Is His Only Need"", ""Is It Over Yet"", ""To Be Loved By You"" etc. This is a must have for every country fan, come discover the beauty of Wynonna's music."
4,Pleasantly pleased,"Having both volumes of The Judds Greatest Hits, I thought that this would be a good addition to my CD collection. Pleased with the songs on the disc."
5,Music to my ears!!,"Very happy with this CD. Can't beat the price. Even though it is one of Wynonna's older CD's, it is one of my favorites. I would highly recommend this to any Wynonna fans."
2,"Sloppy, Quick & Easy","This seems like a CD in which they found some old recordings of Segovia and Montoya and decided to put them on a CD titled ""Spanish Guitar Magic"". Half of the CD is Segovia live and the other is Montoya. I could get through the Segovia half without too much pain. There just seems to be something lacking in the performance and sound quality. Although one song that stood out on the CD is ""Sevilla"" by Albeniz. The Montoya half is so sloppy that even my girlfriend (who doesn't know what a classical guitar is) noticed it."
2,Rather Unpleasant,"This is surely one of those recordings that someone hoped to make money off of, that wasn't sanctioned by the Segovia estate. First of all, it's a lousy live recording and Segovia wasn't playing his best this night. Second, there is such intrusive coughing and hacking from the audience it makes one cringe. I'm sure the maestro would have been horrified to find himself sharing disc space with a flamenco recording, as he felt he had spent his life redeeming the guitar from its status as ""only a flamenco instrument."" Don't get me wrong, flamenco done well is beautiful, and Carlos Montoya is a brilliant guitarist, but his part of the recording sounds as if it was done using the cheapest mic possible and played on a cardboard guitar. The only thing keeping this recording from being one star is the genius of two brilliant guitarists managing to peek out from a rotten recording."
4,The Kinks are Back,"This is a 3 track single.The tracks are:ScatteredHatred (A Duet)DaysEventhough it is not one of their greatest outputs compared to other periods of their great career , it is a fine example for this period."
4,a new auther,jesse i'm no critic but i know what i like in a book. i especially liked Logen an the idea of the shamin. i think that you need to write another book about Logen and show how he grows through the years. expand on a great little first novel by going at it again. show us growth; we want to know what happens to Logen through the years. good luck to you in all future endevers.frances lee.
5,"One needs to be open brained, doesn't one.","This book rocks so terribly hard. I especially liked the ""Thoreau"" character. I think you should write another one about him."
3,"not bad, but a little repetetive ..","overall, this cd is decent. the remixes are all good, but none of them stand out as being drastically different from the originals, and it can get a little boring. if you enjoyed most of the tracks off the new full length, the song Heaven Trails will sound great .. but that still probably isn't enough to make you want to listen to this album more than a couple times through"
1,pretty bad tribute.....,"I bought this tribute album, thinking it would be as good as ""stoned immaculate"" or ""a goth tribute to the Doors"" and it's actually a pretty bad CD. It's sounds like computer music or something. it's not even music! Get Stoned Immaculate or the other cd ""goth tribute"" better."
3,Matrix Doors,"This electronic rendition of The Doors' debut album is an interesting idea, but the quality of the final result is, while not really terrible, not really good either. The music and vocals on ""Soul Kitchen"" and ""Alabama Song"" are pretty bad, and the strings on ""Light My Fire"" do not work. However, the mideastern strings and other instrumentation of ""The End,"" the best and most imaginative track, are effective. The rest ranges from so-so to fairly decent, but the vocals are thin, sour, and whining, which so often seems to be the case in productions like this. The bottom line is listenability, which is not so great on this eccentric CD. I'm OK with three stars, but just barely. Justifiable for those with a special interest in The Doors."
5,Carhart insulate's,These carhart products are the warmest set of work cloth I have found. I'm working in a lignite powered plant outside in all types of weather even when up on conveyors that are 8 to 12 stories up the wind and cold does not get through these carhart coat and cover alls.
5,Warmth,I bought these pants for my boyfriend who works out at the airport in below zero weather and he loves them. He says that they keep him warm and is able to move well in them. Thank you for shipping them out fast.
5,Warm,Need to stay warm and these get the job done. Water resistant and durable. Well constructed with heavy duty zippers.
4,AWSOME,"I would give this a five star but... the overalls ar way too long but hopefully ill get taller, other than than they are wonderfuld and these will go great with my carhartt coat wich is great too but i fal like i got a heater in my coat, this is great b/c you dont need a sweater to put on under it!, after this winter i get looks b/c i look like a black carhartt blob. lol! but its ok there freezing while im walking to school nice and toasty!. I also have boots that go with this and there also great too, but really heavy. These all are really really waterproof and actually repell the water so its good for snow ice or anything.Carhartt Men's Extremes Arctic-Quilt Lined Coat, if your looking for top quality thatll last forever my last carhartt lasted 4 years!) then choose carhartt but be warned when they mean extreme arctic they mean it! hot hot"
4,Great Gift for the Working Man,"Bought this for my husband. The winters get pretty cold in Michigan. Even though this winter really hasn't started yet! But as it goes in Michigan, ""wait a minute, and the weather will change!"" I know that my husband will get pleanty of use out of this gift... Great buy and fast dependable delivery... I would recomend this item..."
1,Show me the money,"The product was awesome! The bibs were just what I wanted, but a little snug. I packed them up and sent them back per instructions. I reordered a larger size and received them promptly. Everything is great except I got to pay for them twice. When ordering these, order a few inches larger than what you think you need. That way you only pat ONCE."
4,Overalls,"I purchased the bibbed overall for my husband because he gets overly cold in the winter months. I mostly love these overalls but, I could only give 4 out of 5 because my husband states that they are really stiff. I would highly recommend this product for others because my husband says that they are extremely warm."
5,Very Warm,"Used these for Ice Fishing over the weekend. It was -2F when we got there. It made it to 14F by the time we left. I was very comfortable while just sitting and even worked up a sweat while dragging the sled out onto the ice. I only wore sweats underneath and don't see a need for anything more. They did just what I wanted them to and with the Cordura shell, I bet they are the only thing of it's kind I will ever need.Fit: I did get to try some on at my local Carhartt outlet so I had a good idea what size to get. I wear a 34/34 in the dungarees. So I stuck with the 34 length. They pile up on my boots a bit but I am good with that as I think the 32's would have come up too short. I went with a 36 on the waist because my gut is a bit bigger than my waist. This still allows room for more layers on top. Though I may have been wearing one too many layers there and even took my parka off for a while. I think these actually cover enough of the torso that you may not need as many layers on top."
2,Oh well,"I sent these back, they were made in Mexico, and had a number of manufacturing defects, didn't fit well. etc. Usually, Carhartt is excellent stuff, I was disappointed, wound up buying Walls at Wal Mart, and have been satisfied with Walls winter suits. I am tall and lanky, and Walls gear fits me better. For boots, I buy Carhartt, though."
4,ENORMOUS!,"I'm giving this 4 stars because they seem to be good quality, and they're quite warm.I've never had to buy in men's sizes before (these are not available in women's) so I measured my hips and waist, and the inseam of my favorite jeans. I should be 48x34, so I ordered the 50x32.When I got them, they're HUGE on me! I measured them around the inside, and they ACTUALLY measure 60""! The inseam was actually 33"", but as it turns out with these, they droop so I was standing on them anyways. But luckily they have free returns, so I'm going to send them back and get a much smaller size."
4,Well written showing different perspectives,"A pretty good book on a ""Splendid Little War.""* Events leading up to the war are explained clearly and thoroughly.* A varied cast of characters are described with enough detail to make them interesting - without being overly indulgent.* The different perspectives of these characters are represented in a clear manner.* The different theaters of the war are clearly explained, but still tied to the big picture.* Implications for the future are made clear during the reading of this book.* Maps of the fighting in Cuba would have made things a bit more understandable and the book more readable.* Teddy Roosevelt is neither lionized nor bedeviled, which is a difficult balancing act given his role in the war.A good book with no major flaws."
5,Clarks at their best!,I'm stationed over in Spain and when I listen to this cd it reminds me of the burgh!
4,Excellecnt Rock'n'Roll Pittsburgh Style,I have seen these guys since I was in 8th grade. They are unbelievable. Fantastic original music.
5,The Night Before Christmas,"This book purchased through Amazon is a long-time favorite, and I expect it to become a favorite of my young friend for whom it is intended."
2,Small Book!!,"I have this book at my home, where I have read it many times for my own children growing up. When I ordered this as a gift for my employer's new baby, I was shocked to see how small this book is when it arrived.This is the size of a pocket book, and does not lend well to sitting a child on your lap and allowing them to read along. The illustrations however beautiful, are too small for young children, and even some adults reading this book!"
2,Too small!,"Love the book, but lost it to water damage this year so ordered replacement. THIS version is tiny and cover does not match picture on Amazon"
3,"Smaller than I thought it would be but nicely made book, great artwork!",My 14 month old may not have gotten the story but loved the pictures:) He liked the size of the book:)
2,Very small book,"This book if VERY SMALL. I must not have read the measurements, so, anyone looking at this keep that in mind."
4,"Well built, nine outlets","While not cheap, this strip is well built and has nine outlets. The only part that seems a little weak is the switch cover, which is made out of cheap feeling plastic."
3,Bayview Revisited,"The book does a fair job of describing the Bayview, but fails in capturing the multi-cultural essence of the neighborhood in the 50's. There were Whites, Blacks, Italians, Maltese, Irish, poor, middle-class, Catholics, Protestants all interacting in a comfortable blue collar neighborhood. Many of the stores and businesses such as dairys, poultry shops, hardware stores, bakeries were overlooked. These all contributed to the strong sense of neighborhood."
2,"Love Dr. Bronner products, hate the baby formula","I'm a HUGE fan of Dr. Bronner soaps - I use the peppermint and lavender liquid soaps myself. I ran out of soap for my baby and purchased this. It is a terrible waste - the product is fragrance free, yet has a sour smell to it. The soap does not lather in the slightest and turns the bathwater an opaque milky white. Kiddo does not feel clean after baths with this soap. Going back to California Baby ASAP! Such a disappointment as I am such a fan of the peppermint and lavender soaps."
3,Nice,"Its a nice little table for the money. Real wood, no MDF. It however is SMALL, this table would be good for a small wall and ideal for an apartment, small room or home. Overall, cute LITTLE table."
2,Misleading,"The color is described as walnut, but is actually a dark cherry. It does not come close to matching my true walnut furniture, so back it goes. I really wanted to like this adorable table. The bottom piece was also MISSING from the box, so it would have gone back anyway. Disappointed. Please make sure you are flexible with the color before purchasing - if you're looking to match this table to an existing piece, it is a darker brown/cherry."
4,"Handsome little table, easy to assemble","I like this table, it looks good, the materials seem to be good quality, it has a nice stain (I got the walnut), etc.. Assembly was really easy, the table top and drawers are pre-assembled, you only have to attach the legs and the hardware. Might have taken me 20-30 minutes.One minor quibble, the drawers do not have slides. I knew that when I bought it - and the drawers work fine and have stops built in - but slides would have been a nice touch."
5,Pleased as punch,"As with all the Winsome wood items I have purchased, this table is well made. Too many inexpensive furniture pieces are constructed of manufactured, ie fake, wood. I have no hall in my apartment but have my stereo set up on it. Works for me."
2,You don't actually want this book.,"You want ""A History of Modern Computing"" by Paul Ceruzzi. THAT is a good book on the same subject. Buy that instead. And ""Hackers"" by Steven Levy.This one has the literary quality of a high school assignment. It is even printed in fixed font. Seems to be self-published; I'd bet many publishers rejected this. With good reason."
4,Charlie helps an old school chum,"Charlie Parker goes for a meal to a Mexican restaurant. Much to her surprise it is owned by Sharon Ortega, an old school chum. Sharon is worried because their business is not doing as well as it did when they first opened. She introduces Charlie to David Ruiz, her partner. Soon after, David is found dead, and the police presume that he has committed sucide. Sharon is in financial trouble and needs the insurance money to keep her restaurant open, so she enlists Charlie's help in proving that David did not die by his own hand. The more Charlie finds out, the more she suspects that David was murdered. She uncovers some shady financial dealings and finds several people who had a motive to murder David. When she gets too close to uncovering the identity of the murderer, Charlie's own life is threatened. This is another good read from the dependable Connie Shelton."
5,Excellent observations of dog and CPA behavior,"Halfway to a cozy,although not excactly Miss Marples, and it does have suspense and action. A great dog and a wonderfully sleazy accountant (he was my favorite character -the heroine is a CPA to compensate). Dialog always realistic but never crackles. Good on South-Western food. Best descriptions of office furniture since Chandler. I bought a bundle from Amazon's cheapo bargain list of authors I'd never read and this was the best. There are plot implausibilities."
4,Partnerships book,"Fun book, easy read. Plot is not too convoluted or deep. Easy and light reading. This was bought for my kindle and works well."
3,Ready for #4,"As some of the reviewers have said, there are a few plot improbabilities so if you are a true crime drama fan you will not enjoy this book. But if you are looking for an entertaining, engrossing literary get away this fits the bill. Charlie and Rusty are as charming as ever, and we get a good look at Ron's 'stupid guy' side. This time Charlie's accounting skills are more important to the investigation, which makes more sense as those are the skills she brought into their firm. Enjoyable from the first page to the last, this third entry in the Charlie Parker series does not disappoint. I think the first two were better - but I am still looking forward to #4."
2,crap,"Just recieved this and MOST of the gaskets match up. It says ""this item fits 1985 kawasaki KX250"". Thats funny, I have a 1985 kx250 and the head gasket I got clearly doesn't fit. For 1 this is for a 72mm bore, stock is 70mm which is what mine is. 2 this gasket is for an engine with 4 bolts surrounding the cylinder when mine has 7. Doesn't even come close. If I were you I wouldn't buy from someone who doesn't know what they're shipping."
1,"bad, bad, bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This was the worst thing I have ever heard. Who ever did this tribute needs to be put out of their misery.Acoustic, yeah right.It was just a bunch of techno, bad techno at that. Someone needs to go back and do Jimi proud!!!!!!!!!Jimi for ever."
1,Out Of Phase-'Acoustic Ladyland:A Tribute To Jimi Hendrix' (Big Eye Music) 1/2 star,"Usually, I'm all for tribute CD's. I mean, a chance for artists to pay homage to those who came before them (in most cases). But this sixteen track disc with covers done by the late great Jimi Hendrix is an absolute insult to any true music fan's intelligence. I wouldn't EVEN want to have this CD around to use it as a drink coaster, It's THAT bad!! Avoid at A-L-L costs altogether."
1,Trash,"This CD is upseting. It doesn't do Hendrix any justice. I think this actually takes away from Jimi Hendrix's musical genious. Whoever listens to this CD is taking away themselves but not opening themselves up to good, real Hendrix."
4,Overall 4 Stars,"Well, I think this is quite a fun toy. The only reason I gave it an overall 4 stars is because the mirror that you can make is very flimsy, not real glass, and you can't see yourself in it! But, other than that it was a very good purchase for the price!"
5,God Bless Anchor Bay...,"They are preserving some wonderful and off-beat movies that we grew up with.Kenny & Co. defies categorization -- it's so much more than a comedy or a family film. It's alternately funny and poignant, but it never comes off as contrived or sappy.I wish more movies could be like Kenny & Co., becuase it's not tied to a conventional plot or story. We just follow Kenny in the days leading up to Halloween.It's a very HONEST portrayal of pre-teen life. The kids are better actors than the adults.don't pass up seeing this one-of-a-kind movie that is finally availible on DVD!"
4,70s time capsule,"It brings back the feelings I had watching it in the late 70s on HBO, just the music alone did it for me. At that time, I would have given it 5 stars, but watching it now, I can't say that it is a perfect movie. I don't know of any other movie or TV show that captures the life of a 10-14 year old in the mid 70s as well as this movie. This was childhood on the precipice of the modern technological age of youth."
3,If you were a Christy fan ...,"Not a great movie, but a must for any Christy fan who needed a bit more of an ending to the abruptly ended series."
2,Disappointment,No one is more of a fan of Ray Charles than I. I've been a fan for fifty years. Apparently the music here was before Ray matured as a vocalist. It's really hard to believe he's singing here. Also the instrumental just isn't his style as I know it.Arlis F. Rice
1,Poor Quality,Bought this skate sharpener because it was much cheaper than the Pro-Filer (about $60). This is a piece of junk. The construction is flimsy and poor and it does not slide smoothly over the blade at all. Buy a Pro-Filer instead. It works much better.
3,You get what you pay for sometimes,"I found this to be a fair wire brush, but not great. I used it to remove rust and paint from steel and it began to fray and lose bristles after about 30 minutes of use.It deformed some (but most brushes do). I'm not unhappy as I purchased this item at good price - but if you are needing to get professional results you should consider another brand."
5,The Best Production of the Opera You will Ever see,Without doubt this is a great production of this opera. There will never be a better one done. Just the singing of Marilyn Horne alone is worth it. And Paolo Montarsolo is another great reason to get this. This is a traditional production ( none of this stark modern nonsense) and is true to the libretto. It is a magnificent production and a feast for both the eyes and the ears.
3,Needs suspension of disbelief,"I will proceed by means of an (obviously enough) comparision with Saylor's Roma Subrosa series: Saylor's Gordianus, anachronistic as he was, at least knew his place, while in order to enjoy Davies' Falco, you have to begin by believing that a Roman humilior - who had even to qualify for the corn dole sometimes - of the Early Roman Empire could adress a senator and his daughter on an equal footing. If you can achieve that (as I did, with an effort) the novel becomes enjoyable."
3,Sam Spade in a Toga,"Silver Pigs is fast-paced with a cascade of cliff-hangers to propel you onwards. But this is astandard detective story, with a protagonist whocould be ""Sam Spade"" (think Maltese Falcon) dressed up in a toga. Other characters fillstereotypical roles. If you are interested inreading a thoughtful detective story, set in anauthentic Roman empire, I would recommend StevenSaylor's books."
4,Five different kids of fun...,"The Falco books defy genre. Sure, there's the gumshoe mystery aspect, but there's also mystery, history (albeit unobtrusive), humor, and a strong and appealing romance. No strong literary pretensions here, but good crunchy prose and great reading fun. Get them all, and read them in order"
5,Awesome read full of intrigue and history,"I first had to read this book for my Latin language class in college. Well, I was looking for something to read recently and remembered this book. I always love a good mystery. This book definitely fits the bill. In addition to just plain good writing (hers not mine!), the book is intelligent and historical. I had forgotten all of the history crammed into the book. It is rare that a writer can turn out a thoroughly enjoyable read combined fiction, history, and intelligence. Bravo! I am now searching for her other books to enjoy!"
5,Signed by the author,"The book is in excellent condition. It is a hard cover but seems a cheap production. It is an import so maybe it is just the British style. HOWEVER it is signed by the author, my favorite author, and if it had been printed on burlap I would still treasue it!"
4,What fun!,"When Marcus Didius Falco finds himself rescuing the beautiful niece of a Roman Senator he lets himself in for a world of hurt and a very dangerous assignment. But the plot takes a back seat to the character development. By the end of this book, one has become charmed by and devoted to Falco and his friends."
5,Mystery and History,"I am an unabashed fan of Lindsey Davis ... I love reading books that bring history to fiction. This book is the first in a series about Falco, a ""private detective"" in ancient Italy, circa AD 60s. The book combines mystery, humor, romance and a very real depiction of how life could have been in Italy. Without giving the story away ... Falco is a ""lower class"" person, who somehow manages to get the attention of a senator's daughter (nicely) and becomes the informant to the emperor. Without losing his street smarts and wit. The author does a wonderful job of bringing the characters to life and as you read this book, their conversations and settings will create a very vivid picture in your minds. As I said, I am a fan! PS: Silver Pigs refer to silver ingots that are the property of the emporer ... which of course, get ""mislaid"""
2,Nice if it worked at 100%,"I already had one of these, but the vertical movement started to be less and less accurate (I had to scroll a lot to barely move the pointer)So I decided, ""hey, It's time to get a new one"" too bad the new one already had the same issue...So, it's a nice product, but the construction may be a little cheap."
3,Good Idea but not good for the duration,"I have owned these for several years. Constantly cleaning the ball and it's contact wheels. I own about 12 broken ones. Later ones, the wire has gotten smaller and easier broken. I keep buying them because I love them. Please, Someone Build a better version and I will be the first to buy it. All I can say is buy as cheap as you can so you won't be as heartbroken when it quits. I am buying a new one today."
5,Awsome Finger Trackball's,This is a fantastic Trackball. One of our employees sware by these and it is awsome. She loves it so much that we are keeping this in our future buyers.Thanks
2,Cute NOVELTY item...dinky.,"The idea was good. It serves its purpose and is good for surfing without a desktop. When I received it, the left button didn't work. I even tried to switch primary buttons. The lightwieght super slippery plastic track ball was very squirly and loose (the pointer was very spastic). Using a heavier-duty rubberized ball would be much better to stop the squirliness. The 'nub' to help support it doesn't do a darn thing. Maybe if it (the support 'nub') were longer and curved as to actually have something to grasp onto. Cute NOVELTY idea but from the looks of other people's posts, it won't last. Wish its design and materials were better."
1,"Buy a mouse also, you will need it!","Order this junk, and buy a new regular mouse also, when you have them both, throw away the finger mouse and use the new (regular) mouse.I got one for my daughter, after 10 minutes the rollers under the green ball broke (yes broke) its junk, about 5 or 10 years ago i found one that was optical not ball type, dog ate it and i havent been able to find one since. dont buy this one it is truly junk."
4,great beginner book,"My son started taking violin lessons and this book was requested by his teacher. it is very cute and fun. Kept him interested while doing the required activities. Definately for a beginner. He was almost 7 when he started with this book. It includes stickers for some of the activities too, who doesn't love stickers?"
5,"""Fantasy Fabrics""","Great jump start for your creative juices toward quilting as art, Bonnie's zillion innovations popping out at me from every page. Until I have the opportunity to see Bonnie's lecture, or until I can take one of her work shops this book will be my guide toward my own fun filled fabric fantasy. Give it a look, 'bet you can't leave without it. You won't be sorry."
5,Fun With Fantasy Fabrics!,"It is wonderful to see a book with a truly unique approach to quilting for quilters and quilt artists. Fantasy Fabrics by Bonnie McCaffery is a wonderful book with beautiful illustrations, clear instructions and inspirational color pictures. It is a ""must have"" for every quilters library!"
4,fantasy fun,"Good book for exploring methods of creating your own fabric by using tulle, scraps, glitter, sequins, etc. in layers with other fabrics. Techniques are described well, with plenty of examples/pictures. Helps you to create fabric that is uniquely your own."
5,The second single promises good things,Saint Joe On The Schoolbus is one of those songs that justs gets ahold of you doesn't let go. Whether it's the catchy guitar intro or the memorable lyrics. This single also features Shadow of Seattle (live) and The Vampires of New York. For those of you who thought Marcy ment One and Playground ment Hit Wonder well you better hit the books because Saint Joe On The Schoolbus promises the success that Sex and Candy brought Marcy Playground.
4,Great Song by a great band,"The only reasons I didn't give this CD 5 stars are as follows: 1, CD singles are generally a rip off, and 2, this song, although one of the better ones from the Self titled debut, sounds a little Nirvana-y. Of course, this is not a bad thing, and obviously it's more poppy and polished than anything outside of Smells Like Teen Spirit, but there's always a little voice in the back of my head that makes me think that Nevermind was playing in the background when they wrote this song. The single also features both the outstanding ""Vampires Of New York"" and the oddly appropriate ""Shadow of Seattle"".For MP Fanatics only"
5,atmospheric & powerful,"A relatively new ballet that lives up to the great story in every way. Foreboding, dramatic, unexpected. As satisfying as a sudden, wild thunderstorm that pours rivers of rain, crisscrosses the sky with lightning, rattles the windows, and suddenly stops, leaving a moist and perfect stillness."
4,A great read!,"I was fortunate to meet Philip at IWM Duxford, Cambridgeshire, UK in July this year. I spent several engrossing minutes talking to him. Have really enjoyed reading the book, not wanting it to finish as as I enjoyed it so much. Have a queue of people in the office interested as well !!"
5,I would recommend this to anyone,"Although I have not actually had a chance yet to fully finish reading this great book, I would like to say that I have met Philip Gray personally at the Toronto Aerospace Museum on the Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Downsview.Having talked to Philip several times, I can say that he remains very sharp minded, and can tell you all kinds of interesting stories from his colorful life.It's very rare to meet someone who has such excellent recall of times nearly 60 years in the past.If you're ever in Toronto, you should drop by the museum, and get to see the restoration (in progress) of a Lancaster bomber. Philip is around quite often to give you a personal tour."
5,"An excellent, personal account of an RAF Lancaster bomber commander (Philip Gray) in WW2.","I admit a positive prejudice, as I know Philip Gray personally. However, the book is still a VERY realistic look into the trials and tribulations of Phil and his crew, as they flew mission after deadly mission for RAF Bomber Command (out of Stradishall, UK) in 1944 and 1945. This is an excellent read from Phil's personal take on those VERY perilous missions."
1,Too small,This organizer isn't tall enough for letter size paper. You have to bend all of your paper when you close it.
5,Excellent for coupon organizing,The labels are easy to use and the case is sturdy enough and very roomy. Perfect for what I needed it for - coupon organizing.
4,Evolutionary Psychology on Sexuality,Buss is known for his integral work in this field. I would definitely recommend it to those interested in human sexuality and evolutionary psychology.
3,Wild Kingdom for people...a good book,"It seems obvious in retrospect that to best understand humankind we must look at our evolutionary past but when these idea were first developed they were pretty radical. In this book Buss deals with sex, mating, and the whole gamut of human desire - pretty good reading! Some people might be offended at some of the arguments offered. Not everyone likes to be viewed as just another animal working out its mating ritual. If you can accept that, though, there's lots of good stuff here. I've read that some people complain that the material is a little dated and I'm not sure about that. I found the book really interesting and a good read."
2,Very basic/introductory,"If you already have quite a bit of knowledge on the subject of evolutionary psychology, this book won't open any new doors or tackle any new interesting questions. It was written about a decade ago, and lags a little bit behind the times. However, there are a couple of interesting facts and perspectives here that you won't find in other books, so it may be worth adding to your collection for a 'used' price."
2,Intellectual laziness?,"This book is an impressive compendium of data, and for that reason alone it might be well worth reading for some. But as someone who likes to see people examine their scientific and philosophic assumptions with some honest rigor, I was disappointed. I am not a fundamentalist christian, and like most people I do accept the fact of evolution - but! I get discouraged when books with evolutionary themes take the form of A) Key unexamined assumption -> ""Evolution explains everything"". B) Therefore, explain everything with evolution. There's a certain faith-based, religious quality to it, a lack of philosophic, analytic rigor that I find discouraging.So - there's a lot of interesting data in this book. But save yourself the trouble - it's all explained by evolution. Largely on faith."
5,"Insightful, wise, and a lot of fun.","Reading this book helped me to understand why my former fiancee decided to 86 me. Due to evolutionary pressures, the whore was looking for a more suitable mate. Now that I finally know what most women want, I can change how I live and behave in order to score more chicks. And you know what? It's working! Thank you, Dr. Buss!"
5,From a Practical Perspective,"I used this book and Buss' Evolutionary Psychology text book a few years back for a term paper in college. At the time I was in a troubled relationship and it opened me up in understanding people's behavior. It clued me in on how the mind works and why men and women seek certain partners. It's not personal, but about survival. Whether this book is scientific factual or proven is no concern to me. Every choice can be traced to our survival instinct. I've recommended this to friends and colleagues over the years to help them understand people and in that sense I recommend it."
2,Bad kindle version!,"Might be a great book, but the Kindle version is scanned poorly that it is distracting. Words are misspelled, the font looks horrible."
4,it's alright,"This book is a decent survey of evolutionary psychological theories of human nature, some quite well-supported and others needing quite a bit more testing. Its greatest flaw is the writing: it is not a pleasure to read.I'd already read Matt Ridley's The Red Queen, and it is at once more well-written and more thoughtful and it has a lot more information. So if you're only going to read one book, or if you're wondering which to read first, I recommend Ridley's.I haven't read ""The Mating Mind,"" but it looks better than this one too.However, despite recommending those other books, I want to emphasize that this one is not that bad. It's just that Ridley's book is so much better."
3,"Well, All Right","This CD should not be your introduction to the blues, or to Muddy Waters for that matter. All the cuts are live from somewhere, at some time, with some musicians playing beside him. But there is absolutely no annotation with the CD, so you don't know who, where, or when. Muddy has better live work out (I like Muddy ""Mississippi"" Waters Live) and the original studio versions of these cuts are better as well. That being said, if you're really into Muddy, he never really had shabby sidemen, and sounded as good in the '70's as he did in the '50's, so this is an interesting little trip."
2,So-so,"This book says it's to help kids learn to read, but actually it's a silly tongue twister. It's a little tough for me to read out loud.I don't recommend this for developing reading skills. It's not worth buying."
1,Not Very Captivating,I agree with the review that this book is tongue twisting - but not in a fun way like Shel Silverstein's stories. The repetitive and similar sound combinations also make the story hard to follow. My kids (ages 2 and nearly 5) got bored just a few pages in and asked me to please let them choose something different.
5,George Strait is still the best and it shows on this CD.,Strait is still the best in country music no matter what people say. It seems like he gets better every time. Carrying Your Love With Me is what every country song should be. I think this is one of his best CD's yet. Worth listening to no doubt about it.
4,Now this is country music!,"In the past ten years, ""new country"" music sprouted it's head. Most of it that I've actually listened to is more ""pop"" than ""country"". This album is totally country, and it doesn't seem to ever fall into a pop stance. It is ""Pure Country""(which is the one movie G.S. was in!) to me.George Strait's ""Carrying your love with me"" is a truly genuine country album. This is the only album I have of the Country singer, but it is one I listen to. Whereas Shania's ""Come on over"" is collecting a lot of dust. If you love the old classic country, like Kenny Rogers & Johnny Cash, you will appreciate this honkeytonk record.It's a great addition to a country music fan's collection.Highly recommended!"
3,Intersting,"This 2CD compilation has pretty much all of CCR's popular songs on it. I discovered it when I was looking through the CDs my wife owned before we got married. I popped it into the CD player and was a bit stunned at the vocals. I didn't realize it wasn't CCR until I looked it up on Amazon, but knew something was different. I have to say, I still enjoyed listening to the CD, but I don't know if I would have spent money to buy it."
4,Right on the money tight performance!,"John Fogerty is missing here but ACTUALLY the thing that jumped out at me the most was the GREAT lead vocal performance! Nothing irritates me more than the vast majority of singers who sing just a little bit flat all the time on live albums. But John Tristao's pitch is absolutely right on the money here! Plus he has a great raspy tone and soul that fits each song. Expect a more powerful, ballsy vocal performance from Tristao. Of course the band is tight as can be. These are some serious pro players! Overall there's a lot of songs that had previously never jumped out at me (as on previous studio albums) but this time stood out."
3,Well done copy.,"This is a CCR CD without Fogerty. Simply that. The sound is a perfect carbon copy, but I can't say the same thing about the vocals. After you've heard ""I heard it through the grapevine"" with Fogerty you won't find a better vocal work. John Tristao isn't bad, but he isn't Fogerty, and, after all, vocals are the most significant part of a band. Besides that, Doug Clifford and Stu Cook are still great. Guitars are well played too. Perfect song selection (all of CCR hits). But, sincerely, instead of buying this one, get both Chronicles. You'll pay more, but'll get the original piece of work."
3,Really CCR ?,"Well, of course, this ain't really CCR. And I know that CCR revivals were often and mostly unreal (and successless).These guys sound pretty much like the real stuff. OK, they are not CCR, but their music sounds close.By the way: how far has rock music come, when such a clone of an old group sounds better than new stuff ?"
1,I'll bring earplugs to the state fair next year...,"I think it's somehow appropriate that these guys recently toured with the so-called Beach Boys, who now feature only the off-key Mike Love and frog-like Bruce Johnston from the 60's lineup. How in god's name did a talented musician like Elliot Easton ever wind up with this bunch? If Doug Clifford wants to lead a band, he should write some songs of his own, or else just play ""Tearin' Up the Country"" for two hours..."
1,"If you love CCR, you'll hate this CD.",Poor imitations of the originals. Don't waste your money on this one
1,I Got Ripped Off!!! Don't Buy It!!!!!,"What a disappointment, I saw the cd after seeing John Fogerty's Live show on Public TV, and thought this would be the ultimate Creedence CD! Don't Bother!- What I want to know is how low are these guys who once backed up one of the prime forces in Rock and Roll, to go out and tour playing A L L of john fogerty's songs without putting out any of their O W N!!! If you are not paying attention (like I wasn't), you won't realize when you are buying this that it has nothing to do with John himself! Save your money and buy JOHN FOGERTY'S PREMONITION CD!!!!! P.S. John- I Know how much you hate the court system-But I would seriously consider sueing them for solely using your material in a private production, as well as misleading buyers in the sale of their music.. By the way...We're GLAD you're BACK!!! Thanks to JULIE!!!!!"
5,Fogerty who?,"Creedence Clearwater Revisted was formed from the basis that these guys love the music and people wanted to hear it live again. John Fogerty, pouting as usual, refused to join and decided only until now to start singing his old songs. The tracks on this album are some tighest redetion of CCR songs on a live album that I have heard. If you are died hard bent on that old Fogerty is God rule I wouldn't sugest this album for you. If you are however interested in listening to something fun and different by all means buy THIS album."
1,Good Iron Gone Bad,"The Black and Decker Professional Iron worked great for the first month. Then it started leaking. It had never been dropped or damaged by me in any way so I figured I had purchased a lemon. I exchanged it for the same iron. After about a month the same thing started. It was leaking, and this time the leak was coming out the back of the iron where the electric cord is connected. I got rid of the box and now can't return it to the store where I bought it. I'm going to e-mail Black and Decker and see if they will do anything for me. We as consumers spend a lot of money on products from companys that have been around for years. To bad the prices are high, but the quality doesn't match......"
1,fall apart dragonball z stadium :(,i bought this for my sons 7th birthday. i thought it would be a great idea for all his dragonball z figures. its a nice idea with a bad design. first of all it takes up ALOT of space and kts hard to actually play over the side walls of the stadium. and the stadium side walls are constantly falling down. you cant move it without taking it apart. i am so disappointed and so was my son.
1,It looked good.............,"Ok, I was at a toysrus store awhile back, I saw this toy and I wanted so I bought it. When I got home and put it together....it was mostly cardboard. I mean 20 bucks for this? I mean it isn't worth 10 bucks let alone 20. The stage is ok, but a 2 at the most, all together I give it a 1 out of 5. Please don't but it."
2,Not so hot,"Not such a great toy (durable wise). My son wanted one for Christmas, and we got it. The biggest problem is that it is very poorly made. Dont't be fooled by the box. The majority of this item is made from cardboard, flimsy at best. My son really wants to play with it but hates the fact it keeps bending. The picture on the box makes it look like its all plastic (that would have made this toy really nice at least 4 stars) but it is NOT!.."
2,worst thing i ever bought!,"my son is a huge dragon ball z fan. he wanted this toy so bad so i broke down and bought it for him. but was he disappointed when we opened the package and saw that it was a plastic ""floor"" and the rest was cardboard. terrible!!!"
1,HORRIBLE,"My 10 year old beggged for this item for xmas. I conceded. To my Christmas morning shock it is mostly cardboard. The tabs don't stay put. Granted the corners and the ring are plastic, but very cheap plastic. Don't even try to move it as it will fall apart. My son even commented, ""This is such a rip off!"" Next week we will be shopping for a playset completely of durable plastic."
1,DBZ PLAYSET,"THIS PLAYSET IS A GOOD IDEA, POORLY MADE. JAKKS JUST GIVES US GARBAGE. THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE. LIKE IN THE WWE TOYS THE ELIMINATION CHAMBER. THAT IS A STADIUM LIKE THIS ONE THAT WAS MADE OF TRASH. DO NOT WASTE YOU R MONEY ON THIS. EVEN A 3 YEAR OLD CAN MAKE A BETTER PLAYSET."
1,dragonball z stadium,this toy keeps falling a part and is a cheap product i don't understand why and body would buy this STUPID cardboard box!!
1,Don't let the picture on the box fool you !,"This thing didn't look half bad on the box. It is a totally different story when you open it. Two boys, 8 and 5, who are huge DBZ fans were disgusted with this cardboard crap. Had I read the reviews beforehand I never would have bought it. Needless to say I learned my lesson.Hard plastic and cardboard just don't stay together when held in place with tabs. Maybe after a lot of time and a glue gun, this thing could be made useable. Don't say you haven't been warned."
5,DBZ Arena,"It is amazing, i use it everyday with all 40 of my dragonball Z toys and have 100's of world tornaments and ss trunks always wins. he's my favorite. this is the best toy i've ever had and its even better with lots of toys."
5,"Eye-Opening, Well Articulated, Inspiring . . .","One of those movies that you want to watch several times. The concepts and arguments are thoughtfully laid out and wonderfully articulated. The subjects interviewed are living legends and being able to hear their thoughts on a profoundly important topic makes this movie a gem. The content will astound you and forever change your perception on the Mayan Calendar and the countdown to 2012. This isn't a doomsday, end-of-the-world panic-fest, in fact it is quite the opposite. It is inspiring and hopeful. Simply brilliant."
4,Excellent for those new to the subject,"There is no point in me repeating the details of what is contained in this documentary. Some of the other reviewers have covered that quite well. My only contribution here would be in the form of a recommendation. I would recommend this film to anyone who is new to the subject of the Mayan calendar end-date of December 21,2012. It is a good introduction to the subject and the people who are interviewed (Gregg Braden, Geoff Stray, Jose Arguelles, John Major Jenkins, etc)are among the most knowledgeable - and, in my opinion, among the most credible - researchers on this topic.Gary Val TenutaAuthor of The Ezekiel Code""2012 is coming...The clock is ticking...The code must be deciphered...And only one man can save the planet...If he can just figure out how - Before it's too late.""The Ezekiel Code"
2,very new age-y,"If you want to watch approximately 45 minutes of a woman driving---literally---then this film might be for you. The amount of footage of this woman just driving from place to place was amazing.Much of the information presented seemed a bit questionable and not really backed up with anything real. Although there are a few good moments in this film and a few good guests who make a few intelligent points (Jose Arguellas, Greg Braden, Alberto Villodo),most of the film is filled with new age spiritual foo-foo....stuff like a rich English woman sitting in her mansion next to her expensive life size statue of Anubis telling us what she thinks is going to happen on Dec 21 2012, and basically unrelated subjects such as the Georgia guidestones. The voice of the narrator is very drony new age and honestly I'm surprised I made it through without falling asleep or at least turning down the volume."
3,"It's OK, but lacks Astronomical and Mathematical Facts","The DVD is put together as a patchwork of interviews with philosophers and writers around the meaning of the 2012 phenomenon and the spritual, psychological and sociological repercusions of the changes that it will bring. However, someone with more appetite for the astronomical and mathematical facts backing the '2012 Cataclismic Theory' (especially the Mayan or Egyptian numbers) will be disappointed."
1,Don't waste your money,"I love Greg Bradden as an Author & speaker but he was barely in this dvd & this dvd was just utterly boring. I ended up selling it to half price books & records. If you want material by Greg Bradden go w/ his regular releases that are only by him like the divine matrix book or dvd. Don't buy this dvd, it's a waste of your money."
3,Excellent Information,The information was excellent but the movie dragged. It was difficult to keep focused. I will watch the movie again but break it up into shorter sessons so that I can concentrate on all the details. I will also let my children watch it in 15 minute sessions so they will be able to get the message.
2,Wasn't Very Inspiring,Kinda reminded me of Janus Joplin traveling across the U.S. without any real purpose or significance...
1,Half-truths and Lies more like it.,"I am a born-again Christian, and a convert to the Catholic Church and I can promise you that this book is nothing but half-truths and lies. Don't waste your money because if you know nothing about the Catholic Church, this book isn't going to help you. If you disagree with the Catholic Church, this book isn't going to tell you anything new. If you ARE Catholic, this book is just going to make you laugh at how ridiculous they *try* to make us sound... and then when you're done laughing, you'll probably be angry. So honestly, don't bother."
1,Another book without Knowledge of Catholicism,"Like the other book written by the same author on Protestant and Catholic, this book too, has no value whatsoever in helping anyone understand the differences between Catholics and Protestants.As is usually the case, this book is filled with inaccuracies and outright untruths about the Catholic Church.If we are to seek understanding, we need to do so with accuracy and not prejudice."
1,one star for humor!,"The best part of the book is when he implies that Pope John Paul II preaches a ""false gospel"" and ""proves"" the implied claim with a cite of the Pope quoting the Bible. Hilarious!"
1,Cover Description is Misleading of the book's True character,I noticed this at local Catholic College Bookstore. This book back cover leads one to believe this short book would give the facts on Catholicism in a concise manner and fair manner. Inside the authors often quote catholic sources out of context or quote selectively to show the Catholic faith is in collision with the text of the Bible. It never gives the Catholic Answer to these charges. Its fairly obvious that this book was written to dupe the less informed. The cleverly written back cover description obviously fooled some people at my local Catholic college into purchasing it. I have since brought it to attention of the bookstore manager to ensure its removal.
5,The perfect first album.,"If you haven't heard Saxon, and want to hear them, this is the album for you. All their big hits rerecorded and it's great. Good songs to listen too. And if you like this one, you should buy more exellent Metalhead (-99)PURE METAL!"
2,Nothin' to Write Home About...........,"As much as I've tried to like this album, it just doesn't do it for me. In a nutshell: too little Dickey Betts, and too much Band. Don't get me wrong: these guys are all solid players, but most of this CD lacks that Dickey Betts' unique style, and too little of his vocals & his instrumental virtuosity. Dickey was too generous in spotlighting all the other guys in the band. And I'm sorry, but a saxophone????? Other than on ""One Stop Be Bop"" the sax just doesn't fit. It's a long CD @ 70 minutes plus, but as much as I love the music of Dickey Betts, I cannot reccommend this CD. Get everything he did with the Allman Brothers or GreatSouthern before you buy this one. This is for hard-core Betts fanatics only."
4,the return of the lonesome guitar,"I bought this cd together with Highway call and must come to the conclusion that after a few weeks I still haven't listened to Highway call.......it's like Let's get together is glued to my cd player. It everything an old Allman Brothers fan would have hoped for, changing from jazz like songs to original old time blues songs, sometimes even with a Zappa like twist. Dickey you've shown the Allman Brothers Band what it's like to make adventurous music again, and thank God with the return of Warren Haynes they will probably again grow from strength to strenght.To be short a GREAT album which deserves to be heard by a large number of people."
1,Now Ladies and Gentlemen...Say Hello to Paul Shaffer,"Yep. Kinda sounds Paul Shaffer and the CBS Orchestra. Nothing against Paul and Co., in fact, Paul does what he does superbly. Dickey Betts, on the other hand, once-upon-a-time was one of the premier talents in southern rock. He became the creative leader of the Allman Brothers Band after Duane's death, and his slightly redneck songwriting style and loping guitar leads is probably the only thing that saved them from extinction. He also did some very respectable solo work along the way. So I don't know what happened here. Dominant saxophone leads....his voice only on three track, maybe. Seems Dickey is just blending into the woodwork.....waiting for the monologue, perhaps?"
1,IT BOMBS OUT!,"I was very surprised to get this program home and find that it seems to have some major bugs. The concept seems great, the problem is the program keeps crashing if you play it too long.The tech people say it has to do with the on-line registration, they report some people can register and some can not.It is very frustrating to spend good money on a program and have it not work.I hope they get the kinks worked out of an otherwise excellent game."
5,Great fun! and Learning Too!,"Both of my children have thoroughly enjoyed the Cluefinder Series, especially this 3rd Grade Edition. I have tried many similar products but have found them to be either to heavy on the education, thereby losing the kids interest, or too heavy on the fun and they don't really learn much. In this product, the children get to work with a small group of kids (whom they may know already from other Cluefinders adventures)as they seek to solve the story/mysteries. I love the way the kids get rewarded for progress during their journey, providing even more incentive to continue. And the best part of all: they really do learn! During dinner one evening, my son showed off some of the math skills he had learned quite far in advance of his school classmates. And it wasn't just rote memorization. He had really learned the concepts. My hat is off to The Learning Company!"
4,Superb CD!!!,"I love the CD outside of not saving or being a help button. I learned about Ra and Napolian. Next,I learned the closest state to Canada was Minnsota.The first Clue Finders CD I saw was the 6th grade one."
4,Great Cream,"Honestly, I really wish this product was fragrance free. I am going to try the Aloe version for sensitive skin, but it doesn't have the same amount of Vitamin E.. But, I am re-ordering today.. and several more jars that before. I have never been through a dry skin winter like this past one has been and come out with my skin in such good shape. I have never found a product that tops it!"
4,good stuff,I have been using this product for about 5 years now and absolutley love it. I have a habit of switching products but I have always gone back to this b/c it truly works. highly recommend if you just want a good face moisturizer to help you along the road to fighting age.
3,good but smelly,"I love what this stuff does for my skin, but I hate the smell. I've been working on the same jar for over a year now because I hate the smell so much."
4,"Good cream, ok ingredients","I bought this cream along with the one with aloe because of all the rave reviews about them even though I couldn't find their ingredients list anywhere. I like more natural ingredients but I thought I'd take a chance because of the reviews and the benefits of vitamin e. I was disappointed then when I found that this cream has mineral oil among other artificial stuff.The cream itself smells strongly for me, but moisturizes well, and my skin feels soft after I use it. I gave it 4 stars because it's a good moisturizer, just not as natural as I'd like.Here's the ingredient list: Purified water, tocopheryl acetate, glyceryl stearate, isopropyl myristate, stearic acid, propylene glycol, sorbitol, mineral oil, decyl oleate, cetyl alchohol, triethanolamine, diazolidinyl urea, allantoin, methlyparaben, propylparaben, fragrance, fd&c; red no. 4, fd&c; yellow no. 5."
3,moist but a lil oily and sticky,the smell is nice and has a creamy consistency.it moisturizes quite well but leaves me feeling rather sticky and oily at times so i only use this at night. not sure if i will buy again but this jar is pretty big and will last me quite awhile. a decent moisturizer.
4,Smooth,"I like this cream b/c it leaves my face feeling nice and smooth. I think its a great moisturizer. I've only just started using it for a couple of weeks, so I'm not sure if its helping with the wrinkles yet, LOL. It has a pleasant smell too, spreads easily and is not greasy. I have sensitive skin and it has not caused my face to break out. On the whole its a nice cream, only time will tell if it delivers on ""smoothing fine lines""."
1,Broke the first time I used it.,This worked fine for the first two branches I trimmed. But on the 3rd branch it broke. One of the wing nuts attaching the blade to the handle broke and now it's unusable. Given the unwieldy size of this item it's not worth the hassle to return; I guess it's off to Home Depot to buy something of better quality.
4,A Good Helper...,"For the price, this product is adequate for relatively light overhead pruning. The blade is sharp but has a tendency to bind and is not as rigid as I would like. I read the same remarks before purchase but felt it would be worth trying it out. If you have large limbs to prune out you probably would want a different saw."
3,Good light-to-medium duty saw,"Good pruning saw for the price. Light and easy to use, but not for heavy-duty work. Had to tighten all the screws first, including those that lock the extension in place."
2,dull and flimsy,"Although this saw eventually got though some of the small tree limbs, it took a lot of sawing. The blade was dull and the hand is very flimsy."
4,A great inexpensive garden tool,This tool was exactly what i needed. Had to trim a few branches that had strayed over the neighbors yard. This tool has enough reach and is stong enough to handle any light trimming. The saw blade is super sharp and went right through limbs up to 5 inches in diameter. This tool is too light for someone whom is starting a pruning service but great for spring cleanup in the backyard. Highly recommended within that use.
3,Fiskars Pole Pruner,"The product is of good quality and was delivered on time. Unfortunately, blade steel is rather light duty for the end of a 12' pole. As a result, attempting to cut with it at full length is a bit like trying to use a rubber knife on the end of a stick. Patience has its rewards. I'm going to see about replacing the blade with a more rigid type in some other brand. Too bad."
2,Too big of teeth and a flimsy blade,"I thought Fiskars was a good name to trust, but they missed a few things with this saw!The blade it came with has both too large of teeth (because we had a hard time getting branches started) and too flimsy of a blade (ours bent at about 2"" from the tip and we had to toss it because it kept getting hung-up inside the cut)The rest of the product held up nicely at fully extended lenghths, but I might have looked into either the string-pull assisted saws or even the blades that connect to your weed-eater. Back and forth is a LOT of work!!"
1,Poor product,"Blade is not sharp at all, also the blade is very thin and weak, handle is very weak and bends easy, the blade is attached to the pole with a very cheap and weak plastic bracket, making it almost unusable and easy to break. Definitely will not recommend this product to anyone."
2,less than expected,"This saw is useful for long extensions only on very small branches or limbs, no more than 1 1/2"" to 2"" in diameter. At shorter extensions, it's easier to apply some leverage. I found the blade too flexible as well.I used it on apple and black walnut. I have a broken walnut limb about 10' high in the tree and about 3 1/2"" thick. I wasn't able to cut it and will need to climb the tree and use a handsaw. If you have a lot of pruning you will be disappointed in the time it takes to finish a limb."
2,pruning saw,Blade does not remain taut enough to easily saw through branches. Did not work as well as I had hoped for.
1,Don't waste your money!,"This saw was advertised as a ""professional"" tool. I would not hire anyone who used this piece of crap. The blade is so flimsy that it wobbles during use, and it binds in shallow kerfs. The pole is flimsy and bends when extended. The saw is barely sharp enough to cut butter. All around, this product is a piece of crap. The only good thing about this buying experience is that I did not have to pay shipping costs.This saw will be on the Friday morning trash pile. It is a good candidate for recycling."
1,bad collar design,"i bought this to cut a few branches in my trees,the collar came off the bottom 2nd time i used it.now its slips off.can't tighten bolts.needs a nut driver which i don't have.should have a wrench with the saw when you buy it."
4,Very good for a small job,I purchased this item from Amazon.Com and tried to cut small branches and it worked very well.The blade is very sharp and strong also.
3,Good pole,"the extension pole is quite nice, but toss the blade attachments, and buy a Bahco pruning head and blade. Amazon sells them. It will bolt right on, and fit better, and cut better too.you won't be disappointed."
1,Bent Blade,"I used the Fisker Pole Saw for a few minutes soon after I received it, and the saw blade bent midway. I e-mailed the Fisker website and talked to one of the customer relations represenatives about this problem. I was told a new saw blade would be sent to me . It has been over a month and no saw blade. The only thing my Fisker Pole Saw is doing now is collecting dust in my storage shed."
3,ok / ligh duty,"The pole is light itself. The blade attaches with 2 bolts. 3 would make the blade a lot more stable than the 2 available. You could drill a 3 hole through the plastic attatchment as the pre drilled holes only alighn on 2 of the saws holes. But, before you drill too many holes, think about a replacement blade. The holes in the replacement blade could very well be in a different position than the blade supplied with this combo.For doing work at say 8 feet and ""on the softside"" material to cut, this works well. This is not for heavy duty items ."
2,THE GREETER,I HAVE TWO DISAPPOINTMENTS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT : 1. THE SAWING PORTION HAS TEETH THAT ARE TOO FINE AND 2. I LATER SAW A VERY SIMILAR SAW AT LOWES WITH TEETH WHICH ARE MORE COARSE AND ALSO THE SAW WAS AT A BETTER PRICE .
2,Where Was I?,"I don't know why Fiskars would put their name on this. A cheap chinese blade on a paint roller handle. Does anyone do quality control anymore? It was cheap, but I didn't realize that Fiskars would sell out and become another pusher of cheap chinese products. I will definately think twice about purchasing something from this company again."
4,Pruning saw,"Pleased with the product. Did all the pruning I needed it for. It is a light weight saw and won't handle heavy limbs, but I needed it for trimming Sheffelera trees and it worked great."
2,not so good,"I don't have experience with other pole saw so I can't compare, but this saw is not easy to use for me. The pole lock is too loose and doesn't lock tight enough when the pole is extended, so the pole extension won't stay but keeps sliding during the sawing movement. The blade is too thin & flexing too much, which easily skips on branches and doesn't stay in one cutting groove, makes it difficult to use"
4,Possibly realistic,"I like time travel books that could possibly take place. She had an almost fatal accident, finding herself in a different era; however, her body was still in the present in a coma. From time to time, she actually could feel herself being drawn back to the present with the beeping of hospital machines keeping her alive. She had to make a decision where she would spend the remainder of her life, if at all. I would like to read other books by this author."
2,Wonderful BUT,"Got this as a gift for my son 1st birthday. He loves the suprise of this jumping monkey every time. He is learing how to turn the handle himself and the box is very durable, being carried and dropped often. However the monkey is so hard to put back in the box, even for me to do using two hands. This a mom and son group effort toys that he loves, but I wouldn't have bought knowing how hard it is to restuff."
5,Excellent Toy...Highly Recommended!!!,"This product was great!!! Very unique & perfect for a little boy, age 1. I always search for unique gifts that you can't find in the super stores & this is definitely a gem. Thank you Amazon seller for making this purchase so easy & making a little boys Christmas special!"
4,monkey in a box,"i got this for my son, because he seemed to enjoy the one from my husband's childhood at my in law's, he wants to play with it a couple of times a week which is pretty good for him. he thinks its boots from dora the explorer so it's cute."
2,Mixed review.,"Thought this Jack In a Box was adorable, and arrived quickly in time for Christmas. But, it is already broken as the clasp that holds the lid down does not work - you have to manually push it into place. If I had only paid $10 for this item, it would maybe not seem as bad, but over $20 and it only lasted for a couple weeks, seems unreasonable."
3,Peek a Book Jack is FUN but is not durable,"I purchased this product for my nephew who is 1year old. He quickly learned how to get jack out of the box (lever or latch). He loves it. That being said, I was very disappointed in the quality of this product and do not expect it will last him very long."
1,Not good...,I bought this for my son for Christmas when he was 1 1/2. It is the cutest jack-in-box I found so I ordered it. He was not able to grab the handle and wind the box. The monkey would pop up if you touched the top of the box at all or jiggled it. It was very hard to stuff the monkey back in and get the top to close shut. He hardly used this toy at all and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
2,Not very good....made at home sound,Sounds like a bunch of Aussies (which it is) who think this is what Italian music sounds like
1,Absolute Garbage!,"This garbage is not worth owning. The writer is borderline insane. His ideas are that boxing is the only way to fight, and his broken English is next to impossible to follow. The author or his representitives are online over on Yahoo and plague the clubs with SPAM and obnoxious posts even after being asked to stop repeatedly. The material that we have viewed is poorly made and the instruction is of very poor quality. You would be better off going to a third grade playground and learning to fight from the class bully. Do yourself a favor and do not waste your money on these books. He has further made reference that America deserved the attack on the 9/11. I would not give this man ANY American money."
1,this thing is junk,"this thing is junk, the remote sensor has the right temp when the temp is above 10 degrees, under 10 degrees it does not work at all. the indoor temp is 6 degrees off."
1,dissatisfied,i found it extremely difficult to set up and while it is supposed to receive radio signals ie daylight savings time it has not adjustedwate of money
5,One Of Yami Bolo's best Albums,"As a reggae artist Yami Bolo as definitely stepped up to the plate. I think he is one of Jamaicas best artist singing roots and culture. His vocal skills are nothing short of miraculous, sounding like the blessed doved with a message from the Almighty to his people. His songs reflect his struggles as a youth in the ghetto, the hardships of the people around him and his love and lovalty for the almighty. One of the best reggae albums I ever listened to and I think that there is more in store from this individual."
4,The Best R&J Available,"This is the best recording of Gounod's Roméo et Juliette opera. Although the CD Cover says it is (c) 1998, it was recorded in October 1995.This is a re-package by EMI of the same exact recording that seems to be sold out, at least here in Amazon. You can find the Highlights CD on Amazon by searching for Gounod + Plasson.I must say that, for the price, this re-packagin is a scam. It does NOT have the libretto nor the translation. On the back of the package says you can get them at the emiclassics website, which is a scam for the price I paid. Also, the packaging is very poor and cheap, more according to a $5,00 CD than to this.Regardless of all of this, again, this is the BEST R&J; available, so you can't get wrong with it. The music, direction and singing are excellent and the opera is a pretty good one."
2,An Biography,"This is really a fun CDBe ware!!!!!!!!!!!!Its a Biography NOT A MUSIC CD. Its contains short bits with everyones favorite rapper but mostly its a women with BRITISH ACENT!:) Who apperently reads from a papper. She tells us same things again and again and again.... Its like hearing a newsrepport with a very serious news reporter. Buts its not as good as a newsrepport. The way i see it its nearly wasted cash. But if you are possesd as i am i guess you can buy it, But my advise to you is WATCH TUPAC RESSURECTION INSTEAD OR BUY THE MOVIE WHEN IT HITS THE STORE.Thats a great movie. But its obvious that his mama is the brain behind the film(if you know what i mean).Summary:Its not worth the money"
5,"Wow, this was cool","First of all, a documentary that is entirely narrated by Christopher Lee? That alone makes it worthwhile. This is a really in-depth look at Tarot reading and astrology and makes you realize just how intricate these two techniques really are. It also gets into their histories (what's known about them anyway, Tarot's history is as mysterious as the technique itself) and is all and all a very interesting watch.Even if you are a skeptic, you may still enjoy this set. Of course, if you really get angry about this kind of stuff then you might not be interested."
3,Quick Snack,"My little chihuahua loves these fleecy little toys - they are his favorite. Hard bone, rubber balls, canvas rings - nada. Give him a soft, fuzzy, cuddly little something and he will work to a) rip out the squeaker, b) pull the stuffing out and snack on the stuffing and eventually, c) begin to eat the fabric. It then becomes a sock puppet that he throws around the room to entertain himself. A great toy can last several days, an okay toy may be gone at the end of the day - this one was around about 45 minutes before I had to take it away. I guess the worse the toy's construction, the happier he is..."
1,"8 bones? NO 8"" bone for 6$- way too expensive for what it is!","I am culpable for thinking it was 8 of these toys- a crappy 1-3 dollar item at best. The title uses the number '8' and I wrongfully assumed I was getting these at just under a buck. That would have been worth it but 6 bucks for this is insane, get it at a dollar store. Maybe it's just me, but I think using the 8 in the title without an inches mark or the word inches was a deliberate attempt to mislead the consumer and I sincerely feel ripped off."
2,Fell apart,My 9 pound dog loved it so much it took her about 20 minutes to pull the stuffing out of it. How can a dog toy be this fragile? I've got some serious mending to do.
4,Baedecker's for Curmudgeons,"The majority of reviewers of this delightlfully catty, satirical book clearly fall outside the realm of intended readers--those who hate to travel. To those who have misunderstood the book's intended audience, I would suggest Jonathan Swift's ""A Modest Proposal."""
1,I loved Wellington!,"This man misrepresents Wellington, New Zealand. I question whether he has actually visited the place. It seems to me that he has based his review on old stereotypes that Auckland people have of Wellington. It hasn't been that way for decades. I spent a month there a few years ago, and I was never bored...not once. It's a beautiful city. Maybe he was there during bad weather (of which Wellington has a great deal). You still ""can't beat Wellington on a good day"" as the local saying goes. Don't listen to Russ on this point. Wellington rocks."
1,...and the book is one of them...,"The author clearly has had no need to actually GO to the places he writes about, so don't be surprised to find av lot of wrong information and mistakes.For instance, he writes that Norway was neutral during the war... So far from it, Adam Russ!!! Norway was one of the allies. he says people in Oslo are so depressed because of the northern lights.. I'm sorry to inform you that there is no northern light at all in the south of Norway. (And no ice bears in the streets, either.. ;-) ). But it IS perfectly legal to have a picnic or make out in the park ""Frognerparken"".The author must be forgiven, as this is problably written during his man-struation. The book is called ""101 places not to visit"". This book is one of them."
1,He must have taken his own advice,"Based on what he is writing about the place I really know, he must have been following his own advice: He has never been there. Or he may have been drunk all the time. The author is of course free to dislike whatever city he wants and he is free to express his opinion. But his ""facts"" must at least be not too far from reality. From what he writes about Oslo, I do not have to read any further. This book is not trustworthy."
1,Possibly the worst book ever written,"I have read many books in my lifetime and many of them are books about travel. When I read through this book though, I was shocked by all the false facts stated in it. Apparently the author, Adam Russ, have never been in most places mentioned in the book and his ""reviews"" of those places are based on very poor internet research and may I say... lies? The book is poorly written, 90% of the facts in the book are false and the author simply have no clue about what he is writing about. This book is not worth a single page of the paper it is printed on. It's a shame that something like this is even published. If this is the standard of publisher Chrysalis Books, they definately have a serious problem.If you ever buy this book for anything over $0.10 don't come to me and complain about wasting your money. If you pay less than 10 cents for it, at least you have some cheap paper to light your bonfire with."
2,Year A Workbook for Lectors,"Disappointed! I didn't read the small print. It's a 2005 version, not a 2008 like I thought. Makes all the Sunday dates wrong."
2,Cover Girl Outlast,I was not satisfied with this product. The colors were not the colors I ordered for the most part. It didn't seem worth the trouble to send the items back.Mamie Thomas
2,not as comfortable as I'd hoped,The photo is accurate but the image doesn't convey the lack of comfort.. This is one time I should have been willing to pay more for comfort. These will most likely go to the donation bag.
4,"Great, what do you expect with DAC?","I am a great fan of David Allen Coe and this album does not let me down a bit. I love Johnny Cash and his style, but Coe has a unique way of expressing himself that none other can match. He does a very good job of portraying the feeling behind each song, as usual. If you have never heard David Allen Coe, please buy an album with his songs, a great singer, songwriter!!"
3,Johnny Cash Wannabe,"I Love David, but it seems like he is trying to impersonate Johnny Cash on this CD. Would have prefered the songs in his own style."
1,A total waste of money,"I wish I had read some reviews before buying this product at a local retailer (for more money than I could have bought it here). A significant percentage of the words remain untranslated, and the rest are jumbled together forming no meaningful sentence. Put your money to better use, and don't be fooled by the claims on the box."
2,Not quite....,"I love Vampire Knight. I love the manga and the anime. However, the only good thing about this is the pictures. The voices seem off. i know, it's hard to find a good actor for the character, but I think they could have done better here. I find fandubs are better. I prefer to order it off Netflix, which is a better idea than buying this. There are only 4 episodes, each almost was painful to watch. Like I said, I love Vampire Knight, but I think Viz should have left it alone. I prefer the subs."
3,Animation is EXCELENT but the voices....,"i was very excited for Vampire Knight to be released in English as i have already watched it in Jap. I had watched the first few episodes on Youtube and to be honest with you, i wanted to cry. Vampire Knight is AMAZING! the storyline is excelent but the only problem is the voices, i really don't like the voices they chose for each character. IF you havent watched this series in Jap then it will be safe for you to buy ;) the voices will appear to be fine. For all you who have already sceen Vampire Knight in Jap, i wouldent reccomend you watch it in english.other than that, a great collecters item but for myself i prefer the Jap version."
4,It's a good anime,"I have to be real about this, I was expecting more out of this anime. Maybe becasue it had to do with vampires I was expected something that was gonna blow my mind away. Of course, I am not telling you to buy this anime, it's good, but I was not hooked like other anime for example balck butler, darker than black, and etc. But it is a good anime, but I was expected it to be more darker for a dark anime. I have bought all of season one and two, but havent watched season two yet....but I will want to know what happens. I do recommend people to watching this anime on youtube before buying it. Just in case, but it's a good enough anime for me to buy and watch sometimes. Great anime artwork, great voice actors, but something is missing, I just don't know what it is yet^^"
3,"Maybe it's the English, but the sound killed the anime","I don't know if it's just because of the English voices (maybe Japanese is better) but in my opinion, the voices and the music/sounds weren't so good in my opinion. They sounded kinda funny and in my opinion, totally did not sound like what the mood of the books made the think they should sound like. I think I'll stick to the Manga."
5,Not too shabby,"Do not expect this to be like ECW, FMW, or anything like that.Everyone thinks it (...is bad...). You have to remember, these guys have not been in the wrestling bussiness all that long. The reason I gave it 5 stars was to bump up its average rating , cause some guys are giving it 1 or 2 stars.If you get this video get the first Baptized in Blood with it.After you get those videos you will probably be hooked."
2,this video is completely retarded,"I initially got this tape when it first came out, and I have to say its totally horrible! I would recommend a few of the other XPW and or ECW releases but not this one, the matches are filmed in scuzbag bars and clubs, and the talent isn't much better, the production is crappy and the announcer makes Mark Madden look good. Worse yet theres like a 15 minute stripsow at the end don't get me wrong I like Jasmine St. Claire and all but she did nothing remotely ""Extreme or Hardcore"", this video is for the birds.......its true its damn true"
5,Indispensible,"If you do any work whatsoever with medival manuscripts, this tiny book ought never to be out of your grasp.What you have here is a compendium of the many little abbreviations and curlicues that pepper late medival manuscripts. It does not purport to be a comprehensive encyclopedia of every such abbreviation ever made; after all, each scribe had his own idiosyncrasies. Instead, it gives examples of the most common ones, and illustrates the principles by which they are put together."
5,Empowering Yourself,"Empowering Yourself by Harvey Coleman is one of my favorite books. A friend of mine recommended this book after being advised to read it for her professional development program. When I began reading it, I could not put it down! Harvey describe his experiences in Corporate America and how overachieving in performance is not the only key to rising high in thr Senior Executive Ranks, but playing ""the people game"" is the big portion of the puzzel that is never talked about. I ultimately recommend this book to those who lack the knowledge of the rules to the game of life."
3,decent but not perfect,"I got these couple of days ago. They look nice but the fabric is not very good quality. It feels cheap and makes me itch slightly, even though I don't have the same problem with other gloves, scarves, fabric etc...Otherwise the star on the left hand looks cool."
1,Can't use these gloves,I asked for fingerless wool gloves for Christmas and received these. They don't look like good quality and they make my wrists itch so badly I had to throw them away.
2,Sheds like a dog,"This is no doubt a warm glove. Also some people stated that its two left gloves, not a left and right. But really, most humans have left and right hands that are the same size, so if its two left gloves it doesn't really matter. What I DO have a problem with is that this thing sheds wool all over. I used this at work because its cold, and after using these gloves my desk is littered with shed wool. After a while I couldn't take it anymore and chose an acrylic pair of gloves that doesn't shed. The new ones aren't as warm as these, but its a sacrifice I accepted."
5,"super cheap, pretty warm, great buy","I have two pairs of these, one in black and on in green. I bought them for my friends and they all love them too. They are warm and still have great dexterity so when its cold these are great for reading, typing, or just doing whatever, as long as you don't need a full fingered warmer glove. They are ""uni-hand"" so there is no left or right but they fit just fine. The white text comes off after a little use too, so don't worry about that. They can be used for anything and be trashed with no worry because they are so cheap. Comfortable, useful, cheap, expendable, - what more do you want?"
4,I got these for fishing,"I bought them in DEC 06 and they have done a good job. I can now fish in about 30 degree weather without freezing my hands. Of course they don't have the fingers, but I am usually moving around, so just having the gloves cover the rest of my hands provides me with extra warmth. I would not want to wear full gloves unless it was under 20 degrees, so these really handled a niche for me. They are wool and durable. They would hold water if wet, so try to keep them dry. I got the olive color, so these would be good for hunting too."
1,bad buy,Do not buy these horrible gloves. Hot Topic has better ones for the same price. I was sent two left handed gloves and the quality feels as if you are wearing burlap sack gloves filled with glass and sawdust. Cross is on only one side which is just silly and there is weird writing on the palm side of the glove on the sleeve portion. Sadly my time is worth more than a trip to the post office and even more shipping costs so I am throwing them away. Stay away from these!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,No product yet,"The site claims 3-7 day delivery. Being 3 days via virtually any carrier from the seller, I looked for a 5 day delivery.It's been 15 days and still no order.My local military surplus store is 10 minutes from work. And no shipping.Next time I'll know better :("
4,works well,I like this product a lot. the conditioner doesn't weigh your hair down like most of the conditioners out there.
2,Biotin Conditioner,"Ended up using this more like a shaving lotion. It was too runny to be moisturizing to my hair, I couldn't work it through at all."
1,"Secret World of Mormonism, The","pure crap. It is unwise to trust any book/movie/article that suggests it exposes the ""secret world"" of anything. When it comes to religion start looking for the guys in blackboots. This movie is no exception. Mostly rumor, with a fair amount of simply made up tripe, and a few bits of truth."
2,For good photos look elsewhere,"The book was a disappointment because the 500 or so black and white photographs were of a very small size (usually four in a page, placed like in a checkerboard style) and of poor quality. The 1st Panzer Division deserved a better account and it would be wise to avoid spending money on this volume."
3,Good not Great,"This book is pretty good for the money. The previous reviewer is correct that this is not a comprehensive history of the division. It is essentially, primarily the photo collection of the author who was a member of the 1st Panzer Division. There are some good pictures, but it is not a ""slick"" production. It is worth the current asking price. It is better than the comparable German ""Dorfler"" series of divisional histories. Definitely better for the price than the recent Diary of a Panzer Soldier published by Schiffer."
4,Awewsome!,"I'm a huge Foreigner fan and have been since the late 70's. I wasn't sure about Lou Gramm being out of the band, but after watching this I'm sold! Solid performance, great sound and great camera work and visuals. A great concert package!!"
5,Foreigner is alive and well!!!,Great show by the 'new' Foreigner lineup. Kelly Hansen is every bit as good as Lou Gramm!I wholeheartedly recommend it.
1,"Are you kidding me, again?","I do not have to even wait until it comes out. This is NOT, I repeat NOT Foreigner. This is the Mick Jones Solo band playing Foreigner's music. Was one not bad enough? I do not care what it sounds like. If you want respect, call it what it is!!!!!!"
5,This is the best concert I've EVER seen,"I was amazed last night when I skimmed through the songs on this disc. I watched it in its entirety this evening.Now, I've been to a LOT of concerts over the years and have also watched many, many concert DVD's and blu-rays andthis concert is the best concert I've ever seen. I've been a fan of Foreigner for years but not really a hardcore fan.Regardless, these six guys are tight with every song. I am amazed by Kelly Hanson's voice; great range and very, verysimilar to Lou Gramm's voice. Even though I think Lou Gramm had a great voice, Kelly Hanson definitely sounds as good,if not better, than in the original songs. If you like Foreigner at all you'll love this concert. If you love Foreignerthis is a must buy. Trust me, this concert is fantastic!!!"
5,Front row seats!,"What a treat for the eyes & ears! Kelly Hansen is outstanding, vocally & visually! Great energy & sounds from the entire band...."
3,Good Introduction To Guitar Genius,"I just obtained a copy of Django Reinhardt's Gold Collection and found it to be a good introduction to Reinhardt's guitar wizardy. For the casual jazz listener (such as myself) the less than perfect sound quality should not be that much of an obstacle, that is until your taste becomes more refined and discerning and you have to move on to the higher quality Reinhardt outings. The music here swings with plenty of solos and break neck rhythm playing by Django that gives more than a glimpse of his flamboyant style of playing. As an added bonus Reinhardt is teamed up with jazz violinist Stephane Grappelli, whose soloing on the fiddle is as hot as Django's on guitar. Fans of The Mills Brothers and Fats Waller should dig this album. Not great but good, and cheap to boot!"
5,The Only Cookbook That Makes Me Laugh Out Loud,"Only Jane and Michael Stern could have written this hilarious historic cookbook. They combed archives and libraries and found quintessential recipies reflecting American domestic cooking, dating from approximately the 1930's to the early 1970's.Where else could you find a book that includes a recipie for Creamed Chipped Beef on Toast for 100 (from the World War II chapter,) horrifying things to do with bananas (from the nursery foods chapter), and the hilarious high point--the Luau in Your Living Room circa 1957. I won't ruin this for you other than to inform you that it involves cabbage, vienna sausages, toothpicks and a can of sterno.I've made a few recipies from the book and they've all turned out great. So, not only is it a hoot, you can find recipies for real down home American cooking."
5,A GREAT read!,"This book is responsible for my love affair with reading cokbooks. It's such a fun look at our country's culture through the food (and food fads) of various eras. Jane and Michael Stern have collected recipes from the kitchens of food manufacturers, restaurants and everyday folks and tell the story of of America (in the post-electric kitchen) through what we ate. From wartime rationing to suburban tiki cook-outs, with a loving detour through macaroni and cheese and mashed potatoes and gravy, the recipes are given with fun anecdotes and historical perspective. And many of them are even worth cooking!"
5,One of my all time favorite movies,"Like many viewers I first saw this movie on HBO back in the 80's. Since I was recuperating from knee surgery they had a captive audience but I soon came to love this movie and couldn't wait for the next day's installment. I often dream of visiting the places that Brenton and Philadelphia inhabited. Every time it comes on tv I watch it with anticipation, seeing something new each time. Now gladly I can view my own copy without taking over the tv from my husband!"
1,all the rivers run,"I was going to see about buying the movie, but when reading the other reviews I have changed my mind. I also taped it years ageo on my vhs tape so I too know the scenes that they are talking about. I do hope that some day they make it from the original and stop cutting out parts of movies.A country girl from Maine"
4,Great Australian Mini-series,I loved this mini-series. It is a great story about life in Australia at the turn of the twentieth century. I particularly enjoyed the insights into life on the Murray River in the hey-day of the paddlesteamer. Brenton and Dellie are great characters played very believably by Sigrid Thornton and the gorgeous John Waters.
3,We need release of Full Version!,"I agree with some of the other reviews. This was a great mini-series with 4 complete parts. You need all the scenes to explain certain parts of the story. I too was broken-hearted withen I bought the VHS version that was cut to shreds. I still have my original VHS from HBO, but is showing alot of age. This is one of the few movies that I thought was better than the book. Please release the full version!"
5,All the rivers run,"I really enjoyed this original mini-series, but I am waiting for it to become available to own on DVD! So far it only seems to be on VHS format."
1,DISGRACEFUL!,"A wonderful movie chopped to pieces. I remember the original when it was shown on HBO and it was in four two hour parts, if I recall correctly. Get that if you can and not this. Gave this one star because zero stars isn't an option."
4,Not as great as Jurassic Park?,"For me this soundtrack is exellent. It doesn't get five stars because for me only Close Encounters, Star Wars tetralogy, and E.T. get 5 stars. Not even Schindler's List, although it is beautiful sad and dark music. On the other hand I prefer this score and this movie to the first ones. The first movie was too Disney to me, and the music had to reflect that. In the second movie, chaos and the wild were ruling from the start. At least, unlike the first, it was a bit scary. The Lost World made me go out to buy the soundtrack, but Jurassic Park did not. The music is more aggressive and percussive. I think Lost World is different to Jurassic Park as Episode I is different to Star Wars. Anyway, I would buy this disc just for the track The Hunt. I preffer it to anything in Jurassic Park I."
2,Jurassic Park soundtrack has better music than this,The Jurassic Park sountrack is way better. It was more new and original than the Lost World. It has the same sort of heart pounding music as the first one. Trust me the first soundtrack is worth the money not the Lost World. This is just a music CD that doesn't satisfied.
2,disappointing,"John Williams is by far the master of the movie soundtrack, but frankly, I just couldn't get into this one. Maybe it's because the movie wasn't that great. The only highlights to this soundtrack are the songs that feature the original Jurassic Park theme used in the first film. If you want a complete collection of Jurassic Park soundtracks, then go for it, but otherwise, it's not that great."
3,"John Williams -- a Great Composer, a Terrible CD Producer","The music on this CD is wonderful.The packaging, on the other hand, is terrible. The disk is in a pouch rather than on a spindle. I have seen several of the disks and they all came *badly scratched* from the factory. Either provide a plastic sleeve for the pouch, or use a regular spindle case. Secondly, like many other Williams-produced CDs (Jurassic Park, Phantom Menace, Harry Potter), the duration times of the tracks are absent. Track numbers, names, and duration times should all be present on the back of CD cases for listener convenience and enjoyment."
3,"Good, but not Great by any stretch.","I'm sorry to have to voice disagreement with the majority of the other reviews here, but this soundtrack just does not rate anywhere near the first JP, or any other 5 star soundtrack. While it is not bad, it is also not all that special. Of the over 40 soundtracks I own, this is in the 35-40 something range. The main theme is not bad, and has it's own mystique. But compared to the original theme, it pales mightilly. The original theme returns in the last track, which is nice; but even then, it is more rushed, and not as majestic. The Hunt is also a nice, rousing piece of music, but the majority of the tracks here are just dark jungle music, that gets old after a little while. However, I still say that if you are a JP fan, or like jungle style action music, that you should get this CD (or tape). But if you are looking for beautiful music, anything near the likes of the original JP, you aren't going to find it here."
3,"Good sound, not-so-good upconversion","First, what I like about this system, which I've had for about two weeks now: the audio quality, on TV, DVDs, and FM radio, is good for such a small, inexpensive system; and the iPod dock is a nice touch.What doesn't impress me so far is the DVD upconversion. I've tried every possible output setting on several DVDs, and they all come out looking jagged and pixelated on my 61"" Samsung DLP. I finally switched back to component cables, and they look better.So this probably isn't the best choice if you'll be watching a lot of DVDs on a large HDTV. On the other hand, if you just want better sound from your TV shows, or have a smaller set and won't notice the upconversion problems, this is a good buy for the price."
2,Panasonic SC-PT650 Home Theater System,"I Bought This Unit, When It Arrived At My Home ,It Sure Did Not Look Any Thing Like In The Picture That Was Posted,The Packing Was Very Poor,The Unit Was In Bad Shape,I Did Finely Get It Up & Running With A Few Miner Problems, Yes It Was Used, I Would Say (NOT SLIGHTLY USED) & Probably {Abused} The System Is A Great System, How Ever, Buyer Beware,I Would Advise Everybody To Stay Away From This Guy, If You Want To See The Pictures I Took When It Arrived Here, Fell Free To Contact Me, I Will Be Happy To Sher My Experience With You, WHAT A JOKE.. I Do Like The Unit, Sounds Great,Cosmetics SUCK... If I Can Get It All Working Properly,I Will Say It Was Worth It,But As It Stands,I Would A gen Say Stay Away From This Guy... I Bought The Panasonic SC-PT650... From (tothm1103) On Amazon MarketplaceThanks For The Great Experience On Amazon Cliff"
4,Sounds Great for a little system,"This is a great sounding system for the price and space. I don't have an extremely large living room so filling up the room with sound isn't hard to achieve; but I've always appreciated great sound. This system provides that with a small footprint. The satellite speakers sound just as good as some of the larger Panasonic speakers on other in-box systems. The subwoofer sounds particularly good for its small size. My biggest complaint is that you can not change out the factory installed 20 gauge speaker wire connected to the speakers themselves. I've not had any issues upconverting DVDs on my 32"" 720p LCD tv. The 5 disc DVD player has worked out well for my family and is very easy to use. All in all, great system, just wish they hadn't hardwired such small cables to the speakers."
2,Not bad but...........,"This is not a bad theater system if space is limited but why did Panasonic leave out seperate bass and treble controls (via remote or on unit)? The only settings I can find are pre-sets for movie, music or flat. The sound is terrible when watching local HD channels or FM. DVD's and cd's are better (yes better source) but was unhappy once I discovered the lack of features. The wireless rear speakers are nice but you still end up running the wiring from the rear speakers to the wireless module. Make the rear speakers larger and put a module in each one!"
3,Fine,Did not come with instructions so I have not been able to hook the item up. The lack of instructions should have been notated.
5,Better accuracy than expected,I don't use the software that comes with the product but I've tested it in the field and the accuracy is very respectable. I'd recommend this product to anyone who has a Windows mobile phone that doesn't have the built in GPS. Battery life is phenomenal.
5,very interesting book.,this is an interesting book. I had previous versions of this book and they're usually very inspiring. I hope this new book can meet the bar.
5,Great book,"Another great work of fiction by Daniels who also wrote ""Keepers"".. This book would also make a great movie. He should have a great future in the fiction world. Cant wait for the next one.."
2,No real matches,"I was extremely disappointed with this video. I'd heard that there would be matches like Supreme vs. Axl Rotten vs. Kronus, and Candido vs. Homeless Jimmy, but all they showed were clips. The only full matches were Candido vs. Damien Steele (the exact same one from the much better Babtized in Blood) and the Messiah vs. Johnny Webb, which was less than spectacular. Everything else was just match clips and clips of people in the fed saying stuff or showing off... If you want an XPW video, get Baptized in Blood..."
2,Not a good wrestling video.,I think this video is probably the worst wrestling video I have ever seen. It is only good if you never have seen XPW. But if you are a hardcore wrestling fan I would not reccomend this tape.
2,XPW review,"Before I bought the VHS I thought this video would be full and interesting battles.But once you have this tape and watched it - I could not believe my eyes.I saw fights boring, and in addition - even battles were not fully!Each of the 70 minutes I was looking for an interesting battle, but not ... Therewere no interesting matches, unprofessional matches!Bottom line: You should not spend your money and buy it!"
5,a classic,This book by Geshe Namgyal Wangchen is a must have for everyone interested in the Buddhist path. His explainations are clear and easy to understand.For beginners you can trust the root of Geshe Wangchen's knowledge and for everyone this book can bring you new insights to benefit your meditations.Geshe Wangchen has given a gift to us and this is a must for your library.Through many years and many books I have read on the Buddhist Path I find Awakening the Mind to Enlightenment a true classic to rely upon.
2,One-sided,"Nimium urget auctoritatem Scripturae Sacrae, si quis dixerit eam esse solum fontem cognoscendi solamque normam. Vera norma est viva ecclesiae traditio, cuius tamen optima et praecipua pars Scriptura Sacra est."
3,A good collection and summary of several key points,A collection of essays on several issues regarding Sola Scriptura. Helpful and clarifies several issues. Not too technical. Contains relevant quotes from ancient Church History. Helps me want to keep the Bible as God's infallible guide for the Church (instead of the Church as the infallible guide to the Bible.)
5,"Incredible, life changing gift","This book is an incredible, life changing gift. Reading it is an experience that has stayed with me and is a part of me!Written so simply and easily understood, I am thankful to have recieved this book. It is like being initiated into the sacred mysteries. The blessings are revealed like a flower opening in the soul!Rev. A. M. Crilly"
2,"""A Unified Field Theory Of Kookiness"" is Right!","Wired magazine's review calling this book ""a unified field theory of kookiness"" is right on the money. I think that the book's incredible claims and statements mark the author as either a truly knowledgeable individual, a raving lunatic, or a cynical opportunist, with my money on the lunatic. As the cartoon Leonard Nimoy has said elsewhere (of something else), ""It's all lies and by lies I mean true. In the end, isn't that the real truth? The answer is no."""
2,Unintentionally Humorous,"The parts of this book intended to be serious are, in fact, hilarious. This guy is nuts."
3,Good in a relative way,"This was a good attempt in the way that it presented tons of strange stuff for me to digest. But for some reason, all these theories became just as annoying as the traditional ones. Except for the stuff about the fourth dimension, that is. Relatively, it is good, since it was different and shocking. However, after I wiped the strange look off of my face, I felt a bit offended at this gigantic ball of strange facts presented through the point-of-view of a child. A little bit more believable than Santa Claus, but a hundred times more annoying. Read some Vonnegut or Huxley instead."
1,wow...,"There are people that liked this book??? My gods man! This book is ssssooooo bad! The guy who wrote this is obviously intelligent enough to take bits of information soak them up, put them together in a very skitzo way and produce a book that can only be enjoyed by those who are equally messed up. If he would have left off the last 6 words of the title i would have enjoyed the book! Look people you want something along the alien/spiritual/magick lines go check out Robert anton Wilson's Cosmic Trigger. At least in there you will have the detachment from a genius author who does not believe everything he thinks."
2,credible or not !,"The following book contains extremly revolutionary information,once proofed to be right, would turn all the human knowledge upside down ; because it evokes a whole sum of new enquiries about the human history,religion and origin.I would give half my life just to make sure what in this book is really true,but the writer was clever enough to title it under this title,to leave us just as confused as we actually are.I would be very gratfull to anybody who would just clear it up a bit for me!"
2,Too Much,"The issue with this book isn't that it demands an open mind, although that certainly will help. The issue is that it tries too hard to tie too many things together, and in doing so references some topics that stretch credulity, even for a book like this. For instance, the Billy Meier abduction has been pretty thoroughly debunked but it's in here. Sitchin's Nibiru? There is some pretty strong cosmological evidence that it couldn't exist or, at the very least, that it could not have been created in the way that Sitchin insists. I'm willing to give Frissell the benefit of the doubt on Toth, Melchizedek, and the greys but by bringing in these other concepts he calls everything into question. If he ""knows"" all this information as he claims, he should know what is crap too.Having said that, it's a thought provoking read and the breathing exercises might be valuable, if only I could visualize tetrahedrons."
4,Ring Buoy is for safety more than it is a toy,Ring buoy is fine. It is a safety item required for our pool. It sits hanging on the fence and was a lot less expensive than many other ring buoys on other websites.
1,Full Moon is empty of thrills.,"Ponderous and slow when it should be light on its feet and dodging the reader's second guesses Full Moon is a werewolf story that quickly looses interest. The writers (Mick Winters is a pseudonym) kept the pace so slow that I started skipping over pages, searching for something to maintain my interest. Nothing was found. DO NOT WASTE your time and money. You have been warned."
3,MY THOUGHTS.............,"I dont know about you but im a bass addict,, gatta have it thumpin,, doesnt have to be earth shaking ,, but it CANT be distorted!!! I wanted something that didnt take much space in my xtended cab f150,, something that could fit right under the back seat. This fit,,, although a bit tight,,, so when someone sits ,, the seat is pressing on this,, not a problem though. It does add a nice thump but it doesnt hit hard at all, but u can tell there is something in the back seat. It does not handle all bass notes that well either, the real low ones make it distort quickly, but i guess for 100 watts ,, i shouldnt have expected more,,, but months after buying this i found more powerful ones at a lower price,, such is life right. This is okay i guess for people who arent really serious about their tunes, but if you want accurate deep bass,, you need more power,, which this DOES not deliver."
3,Nothing New Here,"The Horizontal Organization by Frank Ostroff is well written and an easy read. Its main draw back is that the author is claims that he is presenting something new when in fact it is not. The concept outlined in his book and the design principles for the horizontal organization are nothing but a ""dumbed"" down version of basic industrial engineering principles that has been espoused for years. The concept of organizing around business processes and with cross-functional teams has been discribed in various books by industrial engineers for years, espesially in the area of socio-technical systems design theory. The book is good in that it gives managers, with business major degrees, a good introduction to a sound organizational design theory. Any manager with an industrial or systems engineering degree will already be aware of these principles for organizational design to a far greater extent than the author."
3,A Solid Effort!,"The horizontal organization is a more appropriate model for the knowledge age, according to author Frank Ostroff, who says companies increasingly find this structure more effective. He emphasizes the need to start with an understanding of your organization's core competencies and to develop a horizontal structure from there. Ostroff claims this is the first model of this approach, but it is not. In fact, his fairly academic book advances a trend that is already well documented. Horizontal organizations have been covered in numerous other books, which, like this one, promote more decentralized, downsized, team-oriented organizations with empowered workers. Despite a leaden, pedantic writing style, Ostroff distinguishes his theoretical discussion with several detailed examples of how the horizontal organization works and how you can apply it to your company. We ... recommend this book primarily to academics, who may enjoy its theoretical nature."
4,Horizontal organisation,"A good book that gives a solid introduction to the concept of process driven, team centered organizational functioning as an alternative or complement to vertical structures. I specialize in not-for-profit organizations and in that respect the books commercial examples do not transfer so well, but the concepts are very useful and applicable."
1,Disappointing,"I ordered this product since I am a real estate appraiser. I found it bulky, nearly impossible to calibrate and inaccurate. The instructions with the unit are sketchy. The unit puts out a sonar type signal that spreads out every few feet, there is no way to know exactly where you are pointing it. Also, the sonar signal really bothers dogs - something I don't need while working out in the field! I could not trust it for my work, where I have to be accurate to the tenth of a foot."
2,Far Better Collections Available,Don't waste your money. Parker deserves far better than the dismal sound quality and terrible packaging (no credits or liner notes). The only reason this CD gets 2 stars is that it is the Bird after all and even on this poor CD you can hear the immense talent and genius.
4,"Good tunes, bad packaging","Bird was a great player. He also happened to play with other great players, none of whom are credited on the liner notes to this disc. The music on here is great (although the sound quality of a couple of tunes is horrendous), but the lack of liner notes is a big letdown. Although the CD is really cheap, you can find all these tunes elsewhere with the other musicians credited."
5,Pixar rocks,We have fancy rats as pets so this was a must for our house. Its a great short with really good history of the rat included.
5,Wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!,"I got to say I had this album a few years back on vinyl during my spinning days. Hearing it again was awesome. This is my absolute favorite Danny Tenaglia Collection. I grew up in NYC listening to what I consider early house of the late 70's and early 80's. Danny injects that flavor into new hits with absolute perfection. I'd recommend this disc to any dance music afficcionado,new or old to the genre."
5,Wow,"This novel is a non-stop, never-put-down, read-it-in-one-sitting kind of book. It reads like a film, except you can dive into the characters' heads and come out the other side. There are graphic depictions of death and sex, and there is 'vulgar' language, but to omit such aspects of the world of this novel, that of the Mexican Mafia, would to do an injustice to the world of the novel. Well written and well done."
5,Great multi faceted carrying case,"This case fits large notebooks and it also fits a few dvds, cds, folders, and files. The pockets are very useful for keeing things organized. It fits my style and I would recommend it to other college students on the go."
5,Grandpa Jones,Great listening music. Takes me back to old Hee-Haw days. Enjoy the old music and people from my younger days listening to radio and then TV.
5,Perfect Gift,"I love it, that's all i can said. my perfect gift for xmas. soo bad it's a special edition. the firm should make more"
1,A Brilliant Idea Gone Wrong,"A low energy, high expense, light. I had two of them in a floor lamp and they lasted one and two years. 7 year warranty requires you to return them to manufacturer ($5.00 shipping). That means that approximately every 2 years you will be out $12 + $12 + $5 for these bulbs. Bought 2 Sylvania 150 Watt CFL's at $8 each from Lowes. Brighter and cheaper!"
2,ufos and aliens is a waste of your time,"I have purchased and watch the ""UFO's and ALIENS"" DVD and all I want to say is ""PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, DON'T ORDER THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE""!!!!!! You will recieve some Government TRUTH within the ""EXTRA's"" section of the DVD, but when you watch the DVD you must ask the question ""What are they NOT telling ME""? I have seen many UFO video's and this one is the worst, I recommend buying ""UFO's: The Secret Evidence"", it will give you at least 80% of the truth about what's happening with this phenomenon.B. Wiggins"
2,"Another SETI-ified ""Is There Life Out There?"" armchair DVD","I bought this one based on the five star reviews. I came away from it quite dissatisfied with its rather conservative overtones and mainstream subject matter. If you've been doing your UFO homework and know the phenomenon's long-standing connection to National Security and how the ""official"" story differs greatly with what is really going on behind the scenes, this one will bore the pants off you, having you wondering when something truly relevant will be discussed. Definitely for the casual observer who is perhaps curious, but is still super-glued to the fence and still sees SETI & NASA through colored lenses. I recommend 'Out Of The Blue'. It's the closest you'll get to the understanding of the fact that mainstream academia has been deliberately kept out of the loop of actual UFO research."
2,Gives no real insight,"If your goal is to actually learn something about Analysis Services and OLAP cubes / datawarehousing, I wouldn't bother buying this book. Well, the first chapter brought some insight to the topics, but the rest of the book is really a step-by-step - point-and-click tutorial in the Business Intelligence Development Studio (BIDS), and the SQL Server Management Studio. The chapter about MDX left me more confused than before.If your goal is to get a simple datawarehouse and cube up and running, with the least amount of insight, it might do the trick. (But where's the fun in that...)"
2,Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Analysis Step by Step,I was extremely disappointed. The book appeared to be a good one but it was just a waste of money. I was not able to attach the database file to do the practices. I do not recommend anyone buying this book.
1,Extreme poorly written,The book is so boorly written that I cannot proceed beyond chapter 3 Page 52. I cannot believe Microsoft totaly left out Technical review of this book to make sure there are ommission. I advise against buying this book instead buy the upcoming release MCTS Self-Paced Training Kit Exam 70-445 Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Business Intelligence - Implementation and Maintenance. These are usually done better if not great.
3,Quick Overview of the Essentials,"This book is centered on its step by step instuctions which demonstrate the features of Analysis Services. It is best to follow the instructions by performing them in Visual Studio. I had no trouble installing the database using the CD-Rom as provided by Safari which includes an MDF file and SQL script.A postitive is that there is very little fluff in this book, it lists the steps and explains the concepts without going into great detail. In fact, I would prefer a little more explanation of what's going on under the hood, but at the same time it is nice not to get bogged down in a large highly detailed book. This is a good introduction to Analysis Services but will not make you an expert."
1,I'm shocked,"I am both shocked and surprised at how completely faulty this book is. I have the previous version of this book; Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Analysis Services Step by Step, and I don't remember it being this bad. Don't get me wrong, I know Reed Jacobson as I had met him at the SQL Server 2005 launch event, and I don't necessarily blame him for the poor standing. I do however blame Microsoft as there is no way they could have performed any sort of Technical Editorial on this book. If you do decide to buy it, watch out for the Writeback partitions exercise in Chapter 10. It blew up my Virtual Server. Twice."
4,chap 3 page 52,"If just finished chapter 3 and over came an oversite in the book.If you do not see the SSAS Step by Step DW.mdf database file, the following may help.Start the SQL Server Management Studio, Select Server type Database Engine, select the connect button.Within the Object Explorer section, right click on Databases, select Attach.In the new Attach Databasees window, Select the Add button and drill down to where the SSAS Step by Step DW.mdf file is located. You should be back at Attach Databases window.In the bottom half, highlight the 'Log' file type record and select remove (it says 'Not Found' in the Message column). Since there is no log file, we need to remove this action.Select the OK button to attach this database to your other or existing databases.That's it. It worked for me. I hope it works for you.Randie@thepettigrews.com"
2,Ran into a problem early in the book,I ran into a problem early in the book in Chapter 3 going through the Schema Generation Wizard. I went through the steps and it said cannot find the matching TimeAttributeType. Now I'm stuck!
3,SSAS needs to be done in a classroom setting.,"I am new to SSAS since December 2008 and of all the three books I have purchased and forum research on this topic, I still find the information given is either too vague or not informative at all. You could probably save your money and take a community college course on SSAS rather than reviewing books on SSAS."
3,Disappointed,"If someone could please recommend another book so I may learn DW/BI and Analysis Services, it would be most appreciated. Thank you."
4,This is a cute cd rom book,This CD ROM book is small but cute! The CD with the book will read it to your child and show illustrations on the pc monitor. There are also a few games (like memory and paint the picture) that are on the disc. I bought mine very cheap and am thoroughly pleased! MY KIDS LOVE IT. Even w/o the aid of the CD the book alone is cute. Nice pictures and easy to read print for beginning readers.
2,Much To-Do About Nothing,I found the style annoying and the content small for the number of pages. I found myself becoming attached to the characters nonetheless which is why I gave the book two rather than one star.
3,Outdated and (mostly) irrelevant,"This book didn't have nearly as much useful information as I was hoping. It's in serious need of a new edition. I knew that it was published in the 1990's, but I was hoping to find it helpful anyway. It's way more outdated than I anticipated.The book is geared toward the breeder who wants to incubate eggs and handfeed chicks from day-one. The handfeeding formula recipes are old and include monkey chow in the ingredient list. Also, a lot of the info relates to waterfowl and other non-parrot species.A lot has been learned about parrots in the 15 or so years since this book was published. I would recommend finding a book that was published within the last few years."
2,hand feeding book,thaught it would have had more information on the diffrent feeding styles but still a good book to read though liked the infromation that i s in it
5,A review of the review (I don't know how I like the book),"From the looks of the review attached to this book anyone who writes a review will be the first person to review the book. This is a nutty review, this ""Kirkus"" review. Is this actually the only book available on this Neil Bush ripoff. If it is I'll be hard put to find reviews of the other Bush boys' gun running and assorted illegal activities."
1,This is a bomb,"Just received this really disappointing product. It never gives the same reading. A nightmare if you were measuring for carpet, etc. I never return products but this one is going back to Amazon."
4,Great Study Guide,You can use this book to also study for NCLEX-RN. This is a great companion to the Medial Surgical Textbook!
3,Somewhat helpful,"This book does not have rationals for correct answers. Other then that, it might be helpful is reviewing chapter material."
3,Great Fun...if you like the genre,"Ok, so I've played this game for a little while and I will just give it a 3 out of 5. THe game is good, personally I liked a lot more Combat Flight Simulator 3, great graphics for the time, a wide selection of planes, German, British or American, including ""secret planes"" or planes that never reached WWII. But in this game, it seems that they focused more on a less realistic experience, and go straight for the action instead. It could have been a fantastic game, if they just added nicer graphics OMG we're in 2006! . If you can spend the money, and you like the genre, give it a try!"
1,hated it,I don't understand why Upisoft is marketing this game when they have Pacific Fighters and IL-2. The later two games are far superior to Heroes of the Pacific. HoP has a squirrely flight model and in every other way is inferior to Pacific Fighters. It's not worth the trouble at half the price!
2,dont waste your money,i own just about every flight simulator game what attracted me was the fact that this was a new game the graphics are very disapointing considering i have one of the best video cards if you want a great flight simulator game go go for il2 forgotton battles of il2 sturmovik very reasonable priced and a lot more in expensive you also can not control the speed of the planes on this game dont waste your money its pure hype
1,Will not run on Windows 7,Will not run on Windows 7 at all. Will have to send back. Will not load at all. No fun at all what a waste of money.
2,"do not know, yet.","i have used 'heroes of the pacific' for only a few hours, and therefore have little to comment on. however, i will say that the purchase of this game was to replace an extremely disappointing 'msfs2'. as to the few hours played, my initial impression was of let down. but, knowing the general quality of ubisoft, i will have to get much deeper into it before giving any meaningful comment."
3,Hilarious!,Humor is a hard thing to find. You're either born with the talent to make people laugh or you're not. Bill Plympton was born with it! He puts the characters in his work through excruciating torture in a humorous way. I suggest that anyone who enjoys Gary Larsen's The Far Side to give Bill Plympton a try. You may even find Bill surpasses Larsen in some ways! Give it a try!
2,Paella Western,"With all due respect to one of 20th century's most prominent writers, ""Cristo versus Arizona"" is a shattering failure. Cela tries to demonstrate and emphasize his virtues as a sarcasm scholar, but instead immortalizes the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in much the same way Sergio Leoni terrorized Clint Eastwood's early film career.The author rambles on crossroad villains, murderous prostitutes and countless alien characters in a hodgepodge of virtual repetitive nonsense. His caricaturesque obsession with violence and voluminosity of odd sexuality is of incurable puberty proportions; likely the postscript of a young man frustrated with a generation constantly castigated and chastened by tenebrous forces."
5,Favorite show on PBS!,"My 2 year old loves this show. It's her favorite on PBS, and she's really started to repeat the alphabet sounds and the words, and I love watching her. I""m glad they sell DVD packs of it!"
3,3 of 5,"Paul Simon is a brilliant storyteller. He could sing the story of your life in just a few bars without missing a detail. It's a talent he seems to have a true knack for. Melody is another. But that latter fact doesn't really reveal itself on this set, which, following what may have been his best; Songs From The Capeman; is almost certainly his worst. That's not the say that You're The One; he should've come-up with a better title; is abominable. Only the silly Pigs Sheep And Wolves story and the tuneless Quiet closer would fall into such a category. It's just that only about half of the songs are any good. Darling Lorraine is poignant and sweet. Old is quirky and fun. The rest are, at-least in the way of vocal melody; not what Paul Simon says but how he says it; dead in the water. His band does an impressive job as far as percussive rhythm goes, but he's the one responsible for that.marcellee.com"
3,I Wish There Was Another,"I really wish that there was another review book. This book is very good at thoroughly reviewing grammar topics; however, if you need help with reading comprehension and learning how to work with sight passages, this book doesn't really help. There is plenty of practice for these topics, but no procedure or help on HOW to do them. Overall, this book is fairly adequate. Nevertheless, I still wish that someone like The Princeton Review would make a better book. I hope this reviews helps any fellow Latin students.(By the way, I studied this book for about a month before the Subject Test, and I still made a 540. I am an all A's, very smart, high-achieving Latin student, so this mark was a major disappointment.)"
2,Broken shafts.,"I purchased the prosimmon icon club set Oct.07 and although cosmetically they look fine and the grips and balance feel fine also, I am concerned about the durability of the set. The 5 iron shaft snapped off about 6 weeks ago, the driver head split at the top of the face, both have been replaced by prosimmon expediantly. Subsequently, the shaft on my 8 iron snapped off just last week like the 5 iron did, and am presently waiting for a response. I am concerned what will happen once my 1 year warranty expires."
2,"not the best, but i didnt pay alot","First of all, they are not any longer than normal clubs. Secondly, the driver and woods are very poorly made. I have not had any issues with the irons yet, but the drivers head flew off and the other woods are cracking. The bag is very nice though. I think that was almost worth half the purchase value.If you are a serious golfer these clubs are not for you. For a first set they will probably work, although you should not use their driver."
3,valuable lesson for chicken owners,"Heedly is another naughty pet from author Wendy Ann Gardner's past. He just can't help himself! This book has a funny premise and a lesson to kids about staring at others- well, namely Heedly the chicken. Written on a pre-school to kindergarten level, the story has a rhyming cadence that's easy to read and to read out loud. The illustrations are simple yet vivid and suit the content of the book. It's a funny book that's sure to delight children young & old."
2,Redux,"I was very, very disappointed with this book. Except for a few (very few) examples of the unusal nuances of punctuating fiction, expecially dialogue, it was like reading a 6th text book on grammar. I do not feel the author even approached the promises he made about this book in other books he had written. The appropriate title for this book is: A 6th Grade Punctuation Primer.G. Biggs"
3,Good deal,"I've looked almost everywhere for this book until I stumbled upon the used books in Amazon. Luckily, I bought this book at a pretty cheap price, compared to the $75 for the same book that my school was selling it for. The condition of the book as described was very accurate. Mines had a lot of highlights in it, but turns out, those highlights really helped me on my papers. Shipping was quick, no complaints there, despite the fact that the book shipped to Hawaii (standard shipping), which takes almost twice as long. Definitely recommend go-to if you're looking for used books and receive it as quickly as possible."
4,A nice overview with stuff to bring you back frequently,"Had this book for several years and keep opening it up for the breath of intelligent simplicity that breaks me out of bad habits I might be developing. Contains excellent gems about not overwriting, about keeping clarity of line, about writing realistically. Also has a thousand handy charts and diagrams on such things as part-writing, vocal ranges, counterpoint, basic instrument techniques, basic brass voicings...Should not be the only book you own...but might be the only one you pack on a vacation where you mean to get a little composing in."
2,Attitude is everything,I have found that Intuit is not a friendly company. They certainly do not give a rip for their users problems. I think that other products like MS Money or Moneydance would have a more helpful and a friendlier feel from thier company. I say the product is okay to so-so. The company is a giant and its attitude shows its true colors.
1,"If you have a new Mac, DON'T BUY!","I checked out all the specs on this before purchasing and my brand new Mac fit the bill for all the system requirements so I was good to go. I used to have Quicken on my PC that I dumped and really wanted Quicken back for just the basics - nothing fancy. I inserted the disc and got the message ""Can't open application Install Quicken 2001 because the Classic environment is no longer supported."" It was worthless to me. I contacted the buyer and received no contact back from him whatsover, so I contacted Amazon Customer Service, explained the situation, and they could not have been better to work with. I sent the software back to the sender after a few days after he did not contact me, let Amazon know, and they credited my account pronto. I'm going without a financial package because everything I reviewed thus far has not looked good."
3,seems fine but won't open my bank's downloads,I haven't actually used it because that's what I wanted it to do. Maybe one of these days I'll get around to manually entering the data.
3,Not a fan,"Pants, ok. But I didnt care for the fit, the fabric, or any other aspect of the pants. Would not buy again."
4,a great buy!!,"I bought these overalls for my daughter's Kindergarten Hoedown, who was supposed to look like a farmer. The overalls are great quality and it even comes with a nice white tshirt. The design on front is embroidered. My daughter liked the overalls as well. You won't be disappointed if you purchase these overalls!!"
4,From My Teen Years....,"The 60's were such a special time for musical diversity(SO WHAT ELSE IS NEW, RIGHT?). It's so good to see this on CD. And the songs are still beautiful, dated, yet enthralling. Not even a one hit wonder band, still, the album was and is a unique part of 60's hippie dippy love culture at it's best. Check it out!"
4,Finaly found it!,I had a LP of this group.I Found it with no bumps and scratch.Pretty particular experience.If you like Prog \ Experimental \ 70' rock then you might like this.
1,Not a German Tradition,"I am deeply mystified about the so called German Christmas pickle tradition. I am from Germany and I have not heard of it. I have asked friends and family back in Germany but they have never heard of it, either. Checking German web sites I came across confused Germans who are living in America and wondering why friends keep giving them pickles for Christmas. I myself have gotten a few. I guess this itself now is a tradition."
1,Christmas Pickle Ornament,"I ordered this item on December 21, 2010 and it was supposed to be delivered by December 31 and I just got it on January 13, 2011. I will honestly say I will never buy from them again. They never sent me an e-mail saying that it would be late. It just showed up 2 weeks late...Item was nicely packed with a lot of bubble wrap so the glass bottle would not break. Just UNTIMELY arrival and no noticew whatsoever of it being delayed or late."
1,No,"Ask any German person, there is no such tradition in Germany, no one there has ever heard of this. Not that you can't have one if you want one."
3,German Christmas Pickle in a Jar Ornament,"I bought the ""Christmas Pickle in a Jar"" ornament as a hostess gift. I was going to a traditional German Christmas and this was perfect! It's so cute and I like that it comes in it's own ""pickle jar""."
2,Look for a better pickle.,I bought this to replace a family pickle that got tossed with the tree. This one is cheap looking and not nearly as nice. The jar is strange and very heavy too. It won't stay on the tree branches!
3,music,"the service was really good and the I received it before I thought I weould. I was not as happy with the music, no fault of the ones who sent it . They were just not a great dixieland band no fault of the sender as I said a good business to do business with!"
2,Not for school use,"I had hoped to show this to my general music class at school to introduce them to guitars. Within the first five minutes of the DVD, it is clear that it would not hold the attention of middle school students, AND it is very inappropriate.Very disappointing, and a waste of money."
3,Wired for Sound DVD- Why does it stress Gibson Guitars?,The reason that this DVD Documentary speaks only of Gibson Guitars is that it was made under contract by the Gibson Guitar Company for it's 100th year Aniversary. This was a made for television documentary and was aired on the Learning Channel in the USA. There is also a companion book titled Wired For Sound by Martin Melhuish and Mark Hall.
2,Anything but a true story,"The product description calls this the ""true story of the Gibson guitar,"" but this DVD doesn't tell the true story. The notion that Les Paul somehow invented the Gibson electric guitar is nonsense. Electric Hawaiian guitars and Western lap steel guitars predate Les Paul's ""log."" Fender's electric solidbody guitars predate Gibson's Les Paul model. Les Paul consulted with Gibson, but for the most part the company found his design ideas impractical. Unfortunately the producers of this DVD did not include this ""true history"" from the Gibson company perspective. It would have been much better to include video clips from Gibson engineers, rather than just the oft repeated claims made by the late (and great) Les Paul.The stories and video clips in this DVD from guitar players are fine. But don't think you're going to get any ""true"" history of the development of Gibson electric guitars."
5,Entertaining and fun read for the family,"What a fun book to read. Not only did it bring back memories, it prompted conversations with our children about all the old shows. It was a great conversation starter and made our family trip this Thanksgiving a lot of fun.It will be my gift of choice to give family and friends this year."
4,Informative,This helps to secure my beliefs that the Bible is true. Very good pictures and video with great narration Thanks
3,The Exodus Revealed: Searching for the Red Sea Crossing,I got this because it was recommended by a Pastor friend. There were some interesting facts revealed in it that I had never heard or seen.
2,Boring and sleep producing,"I was very disappointed in this video. It had few items of interest, all of which could be presented in 5 minutes. It seems clear that there is evidence for chariots being left to 'coralize' in the red sea, but that is not in and of itself, evidence of the Exodus having taken place there.I would much prefer the ""clift notes"" version. At least it wouldn't put me to sleep.Why Amazon choose to link this video with two others that are much more interesting, I'll never know."
4,A good case on were the read see crossing are.,Since I have intrested in this hypothesis for several years I find the film a good presentation of the material that are at hand rigth know. It builds upp a strong case for the probability that the read see crossing are in the Aqaba gulf and mount Sinai are in Arabia. But it begins with the question if there ever has been an exodus.But you are left with questions like: Are there other interpretations of the findings that are said to prove that there has been a yewish setelment in Egypt? What about the usual dating of the conquest of Canan in 1250 BC? (This theory follows the biblical dating wih is about 1450.) A one hour movie can not debate all these questions but if you do not have any knowledge before you can draw the conclusion that it is more simple than it is. A hint of these problems would have made the film better.Martin from Sweden
4,Compelling! A MUST-SEE!,It is amazing how the non-Judeo/Christian world is spinning the reason for the coral formations in the northeastern fork of the Red Sea. No amount of evidence will ever be enough!
5,Fantastic and Makes a Great Gift to Anyone,It is hard not to like this wonderful video done by Questar. It gives visual and logical evidence to the actual crossing of the Red Sea. Something that some governments are trying to hide. Don't get Mountain of Fire. That DVD is wrong. This one shows the True mountain of God and shows the actual path that was taken and the actual place that the Red Sea separated.If you decide not to buy then rent it from Netflix or Blockbuster first. It is a must see documentary.Trust Me.
1,already broken after 3 months,I enjoyed it while it lasted but now half of the buttons don't work... I think the plastic keypad is flimsy. What a piece of junk! They could have used metal buttons with real actuators instead of the pressure pads. Also the ribbon cable that runs through the door can get easily pinched. I don't see how this would hold up outside exposed to the elements for very long. Save your money
1,Shockingly Poor design,This is one of those producst that can only be suppofrted by the occasional positive annecdote. For every terrible worthless product out there there is a person who has one swears it is fantastic and has worked for at least the last 100 years and shows no signs of wear.I am the owner of 3 highly reputable locksmth stores and none of them would EVER carry this product. As other reviews have noted this product can only work in the BEST of conditions and with even the slightest mis- allignment it will not lock or unlock and may even break itself. Any product that relies on a small motor and plastic gears to throw a deadbolt is doomed from the start. The schlage push button deadbolt is a hugely popular and much better solutoion that delivers quality and durability at a very attrractive price.NEVER EVER CONSIDER BUYING THE KWIKSET POWERBOLT FOR ANY REASON!
1,Powerbolt is not the best,"After putting up with the powerbolt for about a year I've replaced it with a Schlage push button deadbolt that throws the bolt mechanically ( I consider this a far superior product - you get what you pay for). The powerbolt mechanism works fine if the deadbolt hole is perfectly aligned, the first few times it is used, but if there is the slightest misalignement caused by slamming the door or the door not shutting all the way the powerbolts plastic gears jam. I've replaced it twice in one year under warranty. Do not buy a push button type lock that electrically tries to throw the bolt back and forth."
4,Very Convenient,Good quality and very easy install. Great for busy families with kids; no worrying about them (or you)forgetting the keys.
2,Loud,"I thought it would lock automatically, but it doesn't. You still have to turn the lock handle inside, or press the lock button outside.Also, it's very loud. Every time a button is pressed, it beeps loudly that you could probably hear it anywhere within 50 ft."
4,Another Homeschooler's Review,"I am homeschooling 3 children and we really enjoy these literature units. I do realize I could do it on my own. I could think of the questions myself, I could think of the activities myself. But, frankly, I just don't want to! lol I like having the ideas spelled out so I can lead the activities without so much work involved. There are SO many other areas of homeschooling that I have to plan, research and organize myself, that these activities are a blessing to me. :) My kids enjoy the activities. We make a booklet for each of the literature units that we finish. With the ideas the guide gives me, I add a few of my own and we're off and running without my having to plan each and every activity. If I had to do that, we likely wouldn't bother doing more than having them give me an oral summary and moving to the next chapter. :)"
2,Homeschooler Review,"If your're looking for Study Guides to go along with the Laura Ingalls books, keep looking or create your own. I have reviewed most of these guides because I bought most of them, and regret the money spent. I found that it would have been much more economical, and a lot more fun, if I would have simply used my own ideas in creating study materials for my child as we read the books. It is not difficult to engage a child who is enjoying the books in dialog and questions regarding the material to aid in comprehension and test his or her comprehension; to scan the chapter for age or skill level appropriate spelling words; to give a writing asignment; to do a story related craft or activity; having done this, you will have equaled or surpassed what is available in these guides and saved money. Also, you and your child will be focusing on what the stories mean to each of you and relate it to your life. This is a real value in retaining what is read and learned."
3,Could be better,"From a teacher's perspective, this guide could be better. The questions provided are very surface, recall questions that anyone could come up with on their own. I like questions that require the students to think aobut what they have read, not just detail recall. I also wish it focused more on vocabulary of the time period. That being said, it does have some fun activities to photocopy."
2,Homeschooler Review,"I ordered just about every available Ingalls Study Guide available, and the bottom line is that most of them are not worth the investment. A parent can easily come up with pertinent questions to ask his or her child while reading these books; pick out some spelling words from each chapter; give some grammar or writing assignments related to the reading material; engage the child in some story related crafts and activities; and do just as good a job, while saving considerable money, with the added bonus of catering to each individual child's skills and interests. I was not impressed with these Literature Units."
5,GREAT play kitchen!,"My son got this kitchen at about 18months, he's almost two and he has played with it every single day! He LOVES to pretend to cook and it's very durable since he's not always gentle with it! And as a bonus it's attractive and the perfect size with lots of accessories!"
5,Perfect for 2-year old,"Perfect height for my just turned 2 little girl who stands 35"" who got this gift for her birthday.Pros--Lots play food that come with, pots, pans, spoons, etc. Perfect for pretend play and teaching language!- Lightweight (both a pro and a con), safety wise, it could topple over easily but it's lightweight so there's not much of an injury concern there. It doesn't have to be anchored. So far she hasn't tried to push it down although we have it in the middle of the living room and not against a wall.-Natural finish, no toxic paintsCon--Not that sturdy, compared to her Kidkraft kitchen (which didn't come with play food) which stands taller and feels sturdier, more suitable for older, taller childrenI'm very happy with the kitchen, and so is my girl who just runs right to it and says ""Cook!"" in the morning when she gets up."
4,Cute little kitchen!,"Cute wooden mini play kitchen! Its the right size for our NYC apartment. I like this better than the other plastic kitchens that are out there visually. The price is right and it was pretty easy to put together. We added some Melissa and Doug wooden food to go with it. This is for my 14 month old son who likes to rummage in the kitchen cabinets, etc. when I am trying to cook. While it doesn't completely stop him it gives him something of his own to play with in there."
4,Good buy,"I purchased this kitchen for my 3 year old son and he loves it. I was concerned at first that it may have been too small, however it is perfect. He doesn't tower over it nor does it tower over him. We live in a small house and this kitchen takes up minimal space. He also loves the pot, pan, bread and veggies that came with it"
3,good bare bones wooden kitchen,"We like our LITTLE kitchen, but it is sort of bare bones, compared with other kitchens I've seen. It is wood though, and fits into a small space. If I were to do it over, I might spend an extra $20 or so to get a larger, more elaborate kitchen."
4,Great Kitchen For Beginners!,We got this kitchen set for my daughter when she was 19 months old and she has played with everyday since! Great value for all that comes with it. It is a perfect size for her and our house. I only wish they made a fridge to match!
3,Pretty...,"We bought this for our 2-year old. She hasn't shown much interest in it yet, except for shoving all the components into the ""oven"", slamming the door and walking away! She likes to chop and cut her vegetables on the kitchen sometimes, but we could have used any counter for that purpose. Otherwise, it is beautiful, feels great and sturdy. My only complaint is that there should have been a varnish or coat of protection of some sort on the wood. I love the unfinished feel, but because it is uncoated, every pen, marker or pencil marks on the kitchen are extremely difficult to remove. We have some permanent marks from her wax crayons (that are washable) on the kitchen that won't go away no matter how hard I scrub."
4,Very fun!,My kids got this as a present together and they just love it. My son is pretty rough with it and it has done very well... just needs some occasional tightening. My only complaint is the fact that it has no protective coating at all on it... while that is a wonderful thing to keep it natural like that... my daughter wrote all over it about a week after we got it.. and it won't come out. I wish I had found a way to protect it first. A very fun present!
4,"worth the money, so cute...",my daughter who is 2.5 has been playing with it non-stop since we got it.a great buy. love that it's not plastic.our place is small so the size is perfect.
5,Son loves it!,It's not easy to find a play kitchen that is simple and non-girly. Our son loves to cook and just adores this kitchen!
4,My son's first kitchen,We got this kitchen for my 2 year old son's birthday. It is the perfect height for him. But as the other review mentioned I am concerned that the wood is not finished. Also a few of the pieces of wood were slightly dented or chipped- nothing major- but I noticed. I am sure my son will love pretending to cook with the adorbale food.
2,Disappointed,"The unfinished wood picks up every fingerprint, and is destroyed if a child gets loose unseen with a crayon or marker. The wooden pots and pans are glued together, not carved whole, which means a child who gets creative with a bit of water can quickly destroy the dishes.There is no depth to the sink, either, which makes it hard to play with. The burners don't look like burners, and on top of that, they're round, which makes them look even less like burners to my kids who have only ever seen a gas stove.Also, while I'm all for natural toys, this is PLYwood. Which means it's made with toxic glues. There is next to no value in unpainted or unfinished plywood. We are now laboriously sanding it clean and painting it, since for the moment, that's cheaper than starting over with a new kitchen.I deeply regret buying this piece. It's super cute, and small, so I thought it was great to have in our kitchen. I was so very wrong."
5,"Great, attractive little kitchen!","This kitchen just arrived in the mail yesterday and we immediately set it up. Putting it together was pretty simple, all the pieces seemed to just fit together and my kids haven't stopped playing with it since! I have a 3 year old and an almost 2 year old and they both love it. I searched and searched for a small kitchen that was fairly attractive. I knew that I didn't want one of those huge plastic ones and this one fit the bill nicely! It was a bit smaller than I was expecting, but I wanted small so it doesn't bother me. The quality seems good and the smooth wood is nice and pretty. It helps that the colors match their rooms well too. I think it will be a piece that will get played and played and played with!"
5,Great size and quality,"This kitchen is the ""right"" size, for someone who doesn't want to have kid toys that can fill up any room. This one is nice and compact and my daughter loves it! The quality is really good as well. Simple, but a great toy thus far."
5,Typical but good,"The story was good. Really well written and all. I was really impressed, but why is it that in most of the Catherine Coulter books, the female heroines gets kidnapped and stuck in a rotten old cottage"
4,The Duke,"At first the Scottish dialect annoyed me. However, once I was involved in the plot, I couldn't put it down. I was up until 4 a.m. reading it."
5,THE BEST I'VE EVER READ,"It's been a hobby of mine to read books. I love reading books and I hope that she'll continue to write more. Lord Harry is entertaining and The Lord of Hawkell Island is really moving. Catherine Coultier is one of my two favorite writers. Thank you for giving us the chance to read and learn from your book and hope you'll continue to use your strategies. I like the way you plot the story and how you go about them. They have a lot of details that allow us to form some of our views and make us feel that we are in the book and that we are one of the characters.Sincerely, Maylynne"
3,Cousins?,"It's not like me to trash on a book, I try to be open minded. But the family ties between Brandy and Ian kind of wierded me out. I know they did that then but... Well anyway that was really the only thing that disturbed me. If I forgot about it, it was a very good book! And what she thought was wrong with her, Huge breasts and a tiny waist, poor girl. Such an obstacale to overcome.: ) It did make me laugh though."
4,"good, but kinda sick",Don't think this book is bad it is actually really good . the plot is interesting and the book is really descriptive in what happens but its's still kind of sick them being cousins and all.
5,One of the best wrestling video's i've ever seen,"I love this tape. from beginning to end. I think if you're a hardcore fan and an ECW fan, you should check this tape out. The main event is Terry Funk challenging Sabu for the XPW world title. This match is crazy. They pretty much brawl through the whole areana. My person favorite match is Supreme vs. The Messiah for the King Of The Deathmatch. This is as hardcore as any match could be. There are also some really good matches like the three way dance between Jimmy, Kronus, and ""White Trash"" Jonny Web. The six man tag match between The West Siderz (Kronic and Big Rott) and Carlito Montana taking on Halloween, Damien 666, and Rey Misterio Sr. More harcore action. And you'll see Kid Kaos in too good matches. The first one is an ""I quit"" match between Steve Razanno.The second is a ""Loser leaves town"" match against Tracy Smothers.all and all, i think this is XPW best videos and I think all wrestling fans (Especially ECW Fans) should check it out."
2,XPW Is Harcore to the Xtreme,XPW Go funk yourself was a little bit good.I'm a big fan of wrestling since i was six years old.It cound have been better.That is the reason i give it 2 stars out of 5 Stars.The match that i liked the most was for the king of the deathmatch title.It was the champ Supreme vs.( the challenger) The Messiah.This guys are harcores wrestlers to the Xtreme.It was the first time that i saw that type of title match.I know that title comes from Japan.It was great that they brought it to the US.The other match that i like just a little bit less was for the XPW World Heavyweight Title match.(The champ) Sabu vs.harcore legend Terry Funk(challenger).It was to short but it was not too bad.It's not the match they did at ECW Born to be wired 97.It was a brutal match to the extreme.I consider you to not buy this tape.Just ask somebody to lent it to you or tape you the king of the deatmatch title match.

1,XPW sucks,"XPW isn't a wrestling company, it's just an excuse for Rob Black to show off his porno industry to wrestling fans. Every woman in this company is a certified whore, the wrestlers miss more spots than a broken Hoover vacuum, and the announcers should be jailed for being so awful. They're so bad, I'd rather listen to Eric Geller and Jon Watanabe in the old FMW videos! ARGH! Don't waste your money! If you want good wrestling, get any ECW, new FMW, or ACW video!"
5,Wanted more,"When I finished reading Dan Barry's book, I was hungry for more, but not so much on the same topic. Instead I wanted to find another book with narrative so well-written it would inspire me to fill my leisure time with nothing but reading. Sadly, there aren't many books that do that.This one did. Perhaps it's my own connection to growing up in the same era, though I'm a bit younger. Maybe it's because we're both journalists, though books by journalists don't always merit reading sprints.For me I think what astounded me was Barry's ability to be honest, allowing us to see the weaknesses of the people in the book and see those people as human, rather than evil (with a couple exceptions). As a reporter Barry has seen some amazing things, but that's not the focus of his book. Those things are sidelights in a story about family and about growing up. That takes amazing skill. I'm glad Barry lived long enough to tell us about it. In another 40 years or so, I'll be excited to read the sequel."
2,Jobim?,"I doubt if Jobim had a lot to do with this album. Most of the numbers on this cd can be heard either on the Luis Bonfa album 'Composer of Black Orpheus Sings and Plays' or the Bonfa/Getz album 'Jazz Samba Encore'. And most of the compositions on this record are also usually credited to Bonfa, but with different titles. As far as I can tell the only two 'real' Jobim numbers on the cd are 'Janelas Abertas' and 'Estrada Branca, which are featured here in 'okay' versions. But all in all, if you are interested in hearing this music, you might be better off buying the two abovementioned albums, since they have a much better sound quality."
3,"Ok disc, but not Jobim","This CD features ten compositions written or co-written by Jobim, played by an uncredited group of musicians. It does not, however, contain the master himself. Consider this a warning! Having said that, the music is well- played and (of course) well written. There's a great-sounding jazz saxophonist who is featured on two selections whom I recognize to be Stan Getz. Audio quality is questionable, at best."
3,Obscure collection,"Great music. Poor sound quality. No info about the cd whatsoever. Who played on it? When was it recorded? Still, may be worth getting for the price.."
4,Great trio !,"This is an excellent trio playing new compositions written by all of them (mostly by each individual) . Great uplifting short pieces in mid to fast tempo. The style is modern but one can feel the respect for the tradition (swing, be bop). Swallow is awsome (as always). Don't know the others but the sax player is great and has a style not unlike Lovano. All in all a fine record that grows on you with each new listen."
2,I missed something,"I can't help but wonder if I read the same book that the other reviewers did. This is an okay book, great if you'd like some light reading, but I certainly wouldn't classify it as a must-read. I found the main character to be flighty, and her actions a bit silly at times. I certainly didn't buy the independent, strong-willed woman bit. If Cassidy McCabe were such a spunky lady, why would she continually leave her doors unlocked when she was fully aware of the fact that she was being watched, harassed, etc., by members of the mob, or worse? Wouldn't such an independent thinker put every possible safe-guard and obstacle in place to ensure her safety?That was just one aspect of the book which didn't ring true. The book seemed to ponder the exact same questions over and over, never really going anywhere. The mystery was, in fact, finally solved through pure coincidence."
4,Secret's Shadow,"An excellent first mystery story; the protagonist is believable in her description of a clinical psychologist who genuinely cares for her patients and yet does not consider herself omnipotent. However, she is very upset when she learns that a patient has committed suicide and she did not see the signs; she is unable to believe she could have missed such signs. Worse, the patient had brought up a new subject at the end of his last session and she decided to ask him to wait for next meeting and then he dies. When his estranged brother meets her and states he does not believe his brother is a suicide, urges her to work with him to disprove this she reluctantly agrees. A little romance, some serious threats and a very surprise ending made this an interesting read."
1,"If you like your women dumb, you'll love Cassidy McCabe","Alex Matthews says that she wrote this book because she doesn't think women are accurately portrayed in most mysteries. Women should sue her for defamation of character. Cassidy McCabe takes stupidity to new lows. There were several times when I had to restrain myself from throwing the book across the room in disgust at her actions, or lack thereof.It's too bad, because the writing is good and the story decent. But McCabe is beyond hope and that ruins the book."
2,Just okay,"I read the reviews for this author and thought I would order one of her books to see if I liked it. Usually, I can agree with the other reviewers, but this one was very hard to get into. I don't know what it was, but I just found I could easily put it down and not care about picking it up. When I choose housework over a book, I know the book is not good. I tried to keep with it, but skimmed the last couple of chapters just to get to the end. I did enjoy the cat, but that was all I enjoyed."
3,I don't love these shoes,"I usually buy Saucony shoes, and I always have loved them until this pair. I have a high arch, so I thought this pair would actually help support it, but they hurt my arch."
5,Deliciously comfortable!!!,The greatest running shoe I've ever owned! Can't wait to hit the trails!!!
3,wish it was longer,"This was a pretty good documentary about 6 different journalists who were killed in the line of duty. Considering there were at least 40 others, I wish it was longer and gave a better overview, rather than just 6 specific stories. Only worth watching if bought on sale or if you have an interest on the subject."
3,Better Than a Jack in the Box,"This toaster was an overpriced gift and now it is our morning entertainment. It is over calibrated so the toast shoots out of the machine into the air. If we're lucky, the toast in one slot will just jump into the other slot, if we are unlucky, the toast will shoot to behind our cupboards to the dusty, unreachable netherlands of the floor. While my husband loves its manly looks, I'm the one who eats more toast. The toaster is also a lot bigger at home than at the store. We call it the tank!"
1,Great if you want burnt toast,"I have had this toaster for over a year now, it was given to me as a Christmas gift. I have not eaten a piece of toast that wasn't burnt since I got it. I like my toast lightly browned on both sides, but to achieve the doneness I prefer, your toast always comes out nicely browned on one side but burnt on the other. This toaster has a digital display that goes from 1 to 9, but anything past 2 burns the toast. Other than looking great on my counter, this toaster is not worth the price."
5,Great toaster!,"We love this toaster! It replaces one that only toasted the top of the slice, or burned the ends and left the middle un-toasted. Our new toaster evenly toasts all types and sizes of bread. Admittedly, we did have to experiment to decide which setting toasted our favorite breads the best, but that was no big deal, and now we have perfect toast, muffins, or bagels every morning."
2,I should have purchased the Breville 2-slice.,"What's right with it: Its pretty. The lift-up lever to check out your toast is handy. The eject button is handy.What's wrong with it: It's too big (takes up 90 sq.in.). The big black three-prong plug is obtrusive. The big, impressive, digital read-out is illegible up close. It toasts unevenly and unpredictably. Why would one end of a slice of white bread be burned and the other end undone? It's hard to remove a piece of bread that falls below. The ""Reheat, Bagel, Defrost"" functions are virtually useless. When all is said and done, bells, whistles and design aside, you buy a toaster to toast. This toaster stands in its own way of getting the simple job done of toasting. Maybe I'm asking too much?"
3,Breville toaster,The toaster does great. Actually toasts stuff like it did on old toasters 30 years ago. The only reason that I did not give a five star rating is the price and the fact that you should unplug the toaster after use.
3,Great functions but doesn’t toast evenly,The functions such as defrosting and bagels are great as well as handling large and thick slices of bread. My big complaint is that is simply does not toast my bread evenly. Usually one side is far more toasted than the other in normal or defrost mode (not bagel of course).
3,Features add noise,"Need tongs to to remove English muffins. Toasting better than old Sunbeam Radiant Control Toaster but miss the quiet operation. It is larger than the old Sunbeam and takes up slightly more counter space. On balance, not an improvement."
2,nice toaster but power plug is bulky and weired,"First, to add to description: this toaster is steel and dark grey. See image I uploaded. Though name and Breville's story, made in China.What I didn't like about this toaster was it's bulky weird 3-prong power plug which protrudes ~3"" and thick cord. If your space is limited, this plug is a disaster. Not sure what's the rationale behind this plug (such appliance doesn't even need grounded plug), but I am deciding between replacing the plug or sending the toaster back..."
1,plug and unplug,"if you leave the toaster plugged in all the time, the led display is on all the time, which is a waste of energy for those of us who don't toast every day. also, as others have said, the plug is a nuisance in tight spaces because it sticks out so much. yes, it's easier to pull out that way, but it takes up too much space and if they had an on/off button one wouldn't have to keeping plugging and replugging. i am sending this back."
3,E-Mail Ignored,"This looks great if you need a limited footprint, especially for the apparent 5"" thickness [the 1-Slot Brayn is 25% wider] - But note it's also described as [an impossable?] 4 inches.As they ignore E-Mails to their Web Site's quiry address and as Amazon's apparently been unable to get them to clarify their specifications, customer service can't be very important to them and they may cut corners [break-prone plastic parts, etc.] elsewhere4/3/10 Update basically to say it's holding up nicely & still looks good.NB: Only rarely do we use this for ""repeated toastings"" but then I note that, once its 'warmed up', the next slice, at the same setting, is likely to come out notably darker so we've gotten used to dropping the 'set' one notch after the 1st slices are done.8/15/12 'Takes a lickin but still keeps tickin'[for any Kiddy-Poos out there, ask a 'Senior' for clarfication]"
1,Disappointed,I researched the manufacturer and I erroneously assumed it was an Australian made product. Wrong ! To my disappointment it is another low quality product imported from China that will probably last me a year or so and will end up in the local landfill. What a shame.
1,Beware: Horrible Beeping Noise,We are returning this toaster because we simply can't handle the loud beeping noise that indicates the toast is ready. It literally sounds like an alarm clock. Kids think the smoke alarm is going off. Google Breville and beep and you'll find countless people complaining. It can't be disabled although some owners are opening the unit and ripping the speaker out from the circuit board. I'm going to replace it with a quiet toaster.
3,"Big, Handsome, Short-Lived","I'm old-fashioned enough that I expect an expensive item to last awhile. My toaster suddenly gave up the ghost at about 18 months -- well past warranty.Before it died, I liked it. It did a great job on bagels, even frozen ones. It didn't do quite so well on standard slices of bread -- those tended to toast a bit unevenly. My model did not have a beep -- that's a good addition, because it's not a loud pop-up. Slots are nice and long, and can handle very thick breads -- I took to toasting hot-dog buns in it (on ""bagel"" setting) with great results.But now I'm left with this big, handsome, expensive hunk of stainless steel that's headed for the dump. I'm here to replace it with something much cheaper, and something which won't make me throw away quite so much Stuff when it dies."
2,Disappointing,"The digital readout is cool but is impossible to read from an angle (i.e. it must be at eye level or it's useless). Over time it changes its toasting behavior despite others' claims that it doesn't. It may have a perfect timer, but the heating elements definitely change. The only time this toasted a perfect slice was the first time. Since then every time is different, and it toasts the top of the bread more than the bottom. It also has a small speaker for emitting a beep when done. Nice, except the speaker constantly emits a tone that is barely audible, but is irritating and can't be stopped (unless you unplug the unruly power cable when done toasting). They should focus on making a toaster that toasts before making it fancy. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Loved it until it died,"Looks great and worked very well for about a month. Then one day, all the electronic parts died. Fortunately, my local store gave me a refund and I now have an Oster which does the same good job at less than half the price. It was beautiful so sorry it did not perform well. The store where I bought it said that they had a few returns with the same problem."
3,"Ok, but not great","Bought this toaster about a year ago. Did fair amount of research, but after a few months the heating elements started to ""burn out"". For the price, this toaster really isn't any better than a MUCH less expensive toaster. The quality of the toasting was great - at first. Now it's all about turning the slices around to toast on both sides, etc. Still using it, but am definitely going to replace it - probably with something much less expensive. Even if I have to replace the cheaper model more frequently, I think I'm money ahead."
2,Elegant Dud,"A beautiful, handsome design in a solid and substantial frame with enticing embellishments like its digital countdown clock, but that does not do the job that it is intended to do. Toast was substantially darker on the top than the bottom of each slice. Each slice was much darker on one side than the other. Returned."
2,Annoyed & Disappointed,"The toaster looks nice on the counter and there's nothing wrong with the way it toasts. The description & packaging should include: WARNING: Incredibly annoying, shrill beep that will wake up everyone in your house. If they're going to make the thing shriek at you, they could at least allow you the option of turning it off. The toaster's handle was sticky at first, but I thought it might smooth out over time. Not! I usually do a good job of reading reviews. Obviously blew it this time. Hate this thing."
2,If it cost $40 - I'd give it 3 Stars,"This is one nicely styled toast, quality materials - good fit and finish.It also has some very nice feature: bagel setting, reheat without toasting etc. Another nice feature is the extra long slots.All and all I expected it to be a four or five star unit. The only reason I gave it a 2 is that it doesn't toast any better than a cheap o drug store model. AT $90.00 I expect consistent even toasting and Breville doesn't deliver Fortunately I got it from Amazon - so they are arranging for UPS to come pick it up for a full refund.I just received a Bella toasterSensio 90002 Bella Professional 4-Slice Toasterjust a few bucks more but early indications are that this puppy can toast. I have never seen such even toasting, Edge to edge - it almost looks like a sprayed on tan."
1,"don't buy it, save yourself the trouble","Why are toasters so difficult? Anyway, this one I thought would be a slam dunk, looks good, Breville makes others products that work great, like their juicer is one of the best but this toaster....What a disappointment!!!! Primary criticism is that it doesn't toast evenly. Shouldn't this be a primary function of a toaster? thought I was buying a top-of-the-line one. I should have returned it but I didn't...now one of the slots doesn't rise all the way. I'll try taking back to Williams-Sonoma, but it's been a while, so I'm probably out of luck. Time for the trash."
1,This toaster is dangerous,It gets so hot on the top and sides near the top that my wife burned herself badly simply by bumping it. This would be a real danger with kids around. It is simply not insulated. The brushed aluminum finish looks great but it heats quickly to very high temperatures.There is also a darkness scale from 10 to 9 and at 4 burns the bread to a crisp.Overall a very disappointing product. This is going back.
5,Great Toaster,"Finally got sick of my $10 toaster and threw it in the trash. Research for the best toaster brought me to this one and the reviews are not wrong. I like the countdown display to know how long it is cooking. Bagel setting works well also does the extra lift. Great look to match all stainless appliances, and it feels like its built with quality in mind."
1,Who needs a Toaster to Beep at them???,Ok...the toaster works fine most of the time but come on enough with a toaster beeping at me...it isn't rocket science to remember you put a piece of bread or a bagel in a toaster. The high pitched squeal of this beep is maddening and I want to turn it off!! I contacted Breville and their response was:You cannot disable the audible beep. Sorry for the inconvenience.Do yourself a favor and buy something else that will toast just as well without annoying you in the process.
2,Toaster emits loud alarm with every toasting,"The toaster is just a couple days old, so I cannot speak to whether it lasts more than a few weeks/months (as I see some of the other reviews have), but the most frustrating feature of this machine is that it sounds a loud five-beep alarm every time it's used.This wouldn't be an issue if I had the option of disabling the alarm, or at least controlling the volume, but I do not (already checked with Breville Support).Since I do not live alone, I am very reluctant to use the toaster if anyone is sleeping - it would likely wake them up. This is unfortunate because I'm the earliest riser for work, and I can't make toast in the mornings!"
2,Broke in 4 months,"I was sad to see only one side of the bread toasted this morning, because i usually love the toast it provides. After checking all the settings to ensure a bagel setting wasn't accidentally left on, it was confirmed with a second piece of bread that one half of one slot is burnt out. Unfortunately, Amazon will not take it back after 30 days.After contacting Breville customer service (she was very nice, BTW), I was provided a return label, told to package the toaster in a box and return it to them, and upon its arrival at their main headquarters they would send me a new one.I understand that things break now and then, but 4 months new...? And, although I really liked this toaster up to it's failure, my concern now is how long the next one will last and then what happens after the 1 year warranty expires? As many people have said in other reviews about toasters, ""How hard can making a good toaster be?"""
5,Breville Toaster,After reading many reviews I am pleased with my selection. Toaster has been a nice addition to my kitchen! It looks good. It cooks as the instruction manual says it should. However its only been 1 month so I hope it lasts for the money I spent on it.
2,Not what I would expect from a $80 toaster,"We have one of these cool looking toasters for over a year. It does not get much use, just the occasional bagel at the weekend. When I went to make toast recently I discovered that it is permanently stuck on bagel mode. We contacted the company and got the ""too bad so sad"" you're out of warranty story. This is not what I would expect from a $80 toaster. They have a one year warranty, wow,these people don't have much faith in their product, why should you?"
2,"when it works, it's a toaster","The first toaster we received didn't work. The latch would not stay down, and yes, we had the toaster plugged in. We sent it back to Breville and went through quite a runnaround trying to either get a toaster that works, or our money back. It took about 3 weeks from returning the broken one to receiving a replacement. Customer service was not very helpful, promising to call right back and never doing so, and asking if we returned an expresso machine. The replacement toaster does work, it toasts bread. The top does get extemely hot, so be careful removing toast, or you will burn your hand."
2,Lasted less than 2 years...,"One year after purchase the interior basket broke...something that never happened with any of the toasters we've owned. A big disappointment: the wire gauge for the basket seems thin, cheap, and not well supported. Also, the dial setting would not stay on the number that was set. While toasting, it would change...like the thing has a mind of it's own. ""No, lady, you don't want '6', you want '4'."" Hey, I set it for '6' and I want '6."" What a way to start the day.So, if you're looking for an argument or a strong-willed companion, by all means purchase this model. But, if you just want a decent slice of toast, keep looking! We just replaced this toaster with another brand that is much better made and similarly priced."
5,Surprised that there is such a difference in toasters!,"It was a little hard to justify spending this much on a toaster, but I have been so pleased with it. I've owned a Cuisinart, and a cheapo Walmart toaster and this one is at the other extreme of top quality. It really makes great toast! The outside of the bread is evenly toasted; it must have hotter elements than other toasters but it really makes a difference! I have used all the settings. Two criticisms I have, though they are more cosmetic. It beeps an electronic beep four times when the toast is done and there is no way I can find to disable that beeping. The whole house really doesn't need to know my toast is ready and it does annoy my husband. Also, the LED numbers can be hard to read at the angle it is sitting on the counter and I have to lean down to it to read the numbers. Do I recommend this toaster? YES."
2,Lacks consistency,"Some may consider this review too critical. But I purchased this toaster because our toaster/oven is fine for baking, grilling but is inconsistent when trying to toast things.This toaster, like our toaster/oven is somewhat worse. It almost never toasts bread equally. Sometimes one side gets toasted the other not. Other times it toasts the top significantly more than the bottom.So if these are not issues for you, you can buy another toaster for considerably less money."
4,Nice Toaster,We needed a toaster that could toast long pieces of bread and this is almost perfect. The bread does not evenly toast on both sides but it is close so it is more of a visual issue than a toasting issue. It is nice that you can also get bagels into the slots and it does a real nice job on bagels especially when you remember to push the bagel button! I rate this a good buy.
2,Lousy toaster,"I thought I was getting a top of the line toaster but it was not. Some of the heating wires did not heat. Would not toast about 1/3 of the way up from the bottom no matter which toasting number was set. The lift only lifted the toast up about 1/4"" so still could not get it out of there at times. Not impressed. Returned to Amazon.com for refund."
3,We'll see if this one works better...,"After researching several 4-slice toasters, I bought the Breville CT75XL in April. After four weeks of very limited use, one of the slots came off track and the lifter stopped working, making the toaster unusable. Very disappointed in the quality of the parts. Amazon immediately sent a replacement, as I was willing to give it another try. On the plus side, when the toaster was working, I was pleased with the toasting ability (even toasting). The chime that sounds when the toasting cycle is complete is a handy feature to alert you when the toast is done. It is not nearly as noisy as some have described (much quieter than a microwave signal!) We'll see if the replacement toaster has any parts or toasting issues."
1,Do NOT buy this toaster!,"I would give it zero stars if I could. I bought this toaster thinking it was beautiful and would last a long time, boy was I mistaken! The toaster along with my Breville blender only lasted me about a year, just enough time for the warranty to expire. This company makes beautiful looking products that are built to fail after a year. My cheap Black and Decker toaster lasted for years, don't waste your money on anything Breville makes!"
3,"For the price, only lasted two years.","I am big fan of Breville and have their convection oven and hand blender. This toaster was purchased in November 2010 and for the price expected it would last more than two years.Having two problems that now have me looking for a new toaster.First, is it is not evenly cooking. My general setting which has usually worked well is at 5. Sometimes is cooks spot on, sometimes it under cooks and other other times it over cooks. Most recently it is cooking unevenly, the top half of the bread is underdone and the bottom half is good or over cooked.Second, the lift is not working. You are supposed to raise the handle so the toast or whatever you are cooking is raised high enough to see how it looks. English muffins are a lost cause without wooden tongues to pull them out and a large slice of toast barely pops up out of the top."
1,Fell apart!,"This toaster started falling apart within one year of purchase. It toasts very unevenly, the little toast holding arms inside the toaster have both broken off. I think it is a very poorly made toaster. The first toaster in our family way back in the late eighties lasted almost ten years, It was a wedding present. I have been married twenty five years; after that first ""ten year toaster"", we have gone through at least five other toasters, and this may very well be the worst one of all. Sorry Breville, it was a huge fail."
2,Noisy beeping cannot be removed,"I purchased the CT75XL because I like a 4 slice toaster that has 2 long slots. This toaster is beautiful to look at and works as well as a toaster should.What I HATE about it is the beeping when the toast is cooked. There is no way to shut it off or lower the volume. It's loud enough to wake people up in a small apartment.I called the Breville customer service line and they said there was nothing I could do about it. They would not register my complaint either.For 119.00$ this is completely unacceptable. A shame because it really is a nice toaster. If you are deaf, I would recommend it. If you are an early riser or have young children, buy another brand."
2,Not worth the price,We bought ours a couple of years ago and it works well enough although if you toast two bagels one after another the first one will come out underdone the second one burnt. We junked it the other day as the support arm for the bagel was so flimsy it buckled under the weight of the bagel and was at risk of contacting the heater coil creating a short.
2,stuck down the side of toaster,"This toaster looks great, fits all kinds of bread shape but if the bread is not deep you cannot get it out. Burn your fingers with english muffins and anything smaller around. Going in the trash after one frustrating year! I am surprised we haven't electrocuted ourselves with all the knives used in an attempt to get you toast out. I have dump the thing upside down on more than one occasion. SILLY design, the arms need to come up higher and the little sides need to be wider in each slot so narrow bread does not slide down under the arm."
1,Fails to cook toast evenly,"I bought this because our 22 year old toaster oven wasn't cooking toast evenly anymore. I was very disappointed to see this toaster be much worse than the old Black and Decker dinosaur to the point of being unusable. The toast was black at the top and white at the bottom - regardless of settings. I should have paid attention to the prior reviews :(I chose this toaster because I'm a gadget freak and it looks really cool, but I returned it after only a few tries (wasting bread).I just ordered the newBlack & Decker ST9999 Infrawave 2 Slice Black Toaster. It has only 2 reviews so far, but it sounds promising. I will also review that - good or bad - when I get it."
5,Excellent toaster!,"We only used our toaster oven to reheat pizza. The toaster oven, however, made awful toast. Now we have our toast evenly browned and quickly done. It has user friendly digital settings for desired amount of browning, and it works well. I even toast rice cakes on the lowest setting, without burning. For pizza now we either eat it cold or pop it under the broiler of my large oven. The toaster (and specifically THIS toaster) is a luxery item I had forgotten existed. Real toast, quickly, for a fair price."
1,Sorry to report,"I own other Breville products and love them. I read some of the negative reviews for this toaster, but decided to buy it anyway. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to toast on its inner heating elements. I tried different settings, as well as the bagel setting. I'm willing to always select the bagel option if it means evenly-toasted toast on both sides. But as I repeated my tests, the bread just got more burned on the ""outside"", and not toasted on the inside.I hope you fare better. I returned the toaster.A note to Breville (if you read these reports): please allow the user to turn off the beeping. I would have kept the toaster if it toasted competently, but the beeping is pretty annoying. 5 loud beeps? Make it an option, not a requirement."
2,Nice looking toaster but it doesn't live up to the rep of other Breville products,"Our toaster failed (lever failed to engage) after approximately one year's use. It's performance is on par with cheaper toasters we've owned. I didn't save the receipt and they (Breville) didn't offer any option to repair it. We own a Breville juicer, electric grill and single-cup coffee maker and all have performed well and can be recommended without reservation. This toaster is another story - I would advise to look elsewhere."
5,Makes great toast,Very nice toaster. Worth the money. I like the way the control is on the front and not the end like on most other models.
4,A taste for toast,"Call me impatient. I wish toast happened instantly. This toaster does the next best thing -- it has a display that lets you know how much longer you have to wait till the toast pops. It toasts bread evenly, and the setting for bagels works nicely, too. The feature that allows you to peek without interrupting the toasting process is handy as well. I also appreciate the crumb tray, which is easy to remove without spilling crumbs on the counter. All in all, a quality product."
2,Breville Ikon 2 Slice Toaster,"Read the reviews and decided this was a good toaster. Purchased in 2010 and after about two months od daily use, it quite toasting evenly. Bottom was nicely toaste in both slots, top was not. Had to turn slices and go through the cycle again. Tried to contact the company and got no answer. Called to try to get service and no return call as promised. NO MORE BREVILLE products for me"
1,bad TOASTER!,"This toaster is crazy. I put the toaster on a middle toast setting and I come back a couple minutes later and WOW! there is almost always a fire. It burns half of the english muffin so it is black and dusty. The other half looks uncooked but is a little warm. It is unpredictable and uneven. Sometimes it will pop the toast out so high that the toast doesn't land back in the toaster and you have to look around the room for your toast. I would not recommend this toaster, it is not worth the money."
2,A bit annoying,"I agree with several other reviews saying the alarm is annoying. It doesn't take a lot of effort to know your toast is done. Does this machine toast bread with a reasonable margin of effectiveness? Sure. Would I purchase another one? No. I know it's not a huge deal but when I'm tired and haven't had my coffee yet, the last thing I need in the morning is to hear a bunch of squawking coming from my appliances."
2,Nice design but doesn't toast evenly,"I love the design. I hate the toasting ability.A piece of toast, toasted at level ""9"", the highest, toasts the top two-thirds, and leaves the bottom third completely untoasted.Great design, nice to use, but doesn't do what it's name implies. (toaster)"
1,Bad quality control,A higher price tag normally should reflect better quality control practices. Not with this toaster. I bought my first Breville 4-slice toaster about a year and a half ago. It worked great for 11 months then the lever stopped working and started shooting sparks everytime you pressed it down. I was just a few week short of my warranty period so I called Breville. They quickly agreed to send me a replacement toaster which took about two weeks to come in. I now have had that toaster for about 6 months and are experiencing the onset of the same problem. The lever does click on but will eject the bread randomly before the end of the toasting cycle. The only way to get your bread toasted all the way through is to physically hold the lever down for the duration of the toasting cycle. So much for the convenience of modern technology! Bottom line: Why take a chance on an expensive toaster when you can get one that works as well (or as poorly) for a fraction of the cost?
2,Breville 4 SliceToaster,"Really nice toasting on all types of bread and bagels. Pretty expensive per slice though since the first one, replaced under warranty, lasted only 5 months, and the replacement lasted only 8 months. Not interested in exchanging again."
3,Not perfect,"It lost one star because on 5, out of I think 9, levels of darkness it toasts heave bread or bagels. I have no idea what I would use 6-9 for. The other star is cause it is a little expensive. For the price it would have to be GREAT.It does toast evenly and I like the count down to when it pops. The take a peek feature was nice while I was getting to know it but now I know what number to do the stuff I toast on so I haven't used it in a week."
2,Would Not Recommend,Exactly 2 years to the day that we received this toaster it stopped working--just went dead. I expect a cell phone to last two years but not a decent toaster. I would also add that the LCD display was always a pain to read. Will not be buying another Breville.
2,Good looking toaster..didn't work..sent it back,"My GE toaster started only toasting half the toast. So, I read all the reviews on this toaster and many others, and decided to purchase the Breville. When I got it out of the box I was excited to see how nice it looked and thought the idea of the digital timer was great. However, we couldn't get the toast to brown all over. Actually, worse than my old one. So, I boxed it up and sent it back. Amazon always stands behind its products. I had no problems getting a return label. Still using my old toaster..and actully, toasts comes out better then the Breville did."
2,Poor toaster,"Have used this toaster for over a year now. The first two weeks it was great, then things went sour. Only toasts one side, though elements still work, plus it burns the top edge on one side and the sides on the other slot. Have an old (20 years) toaster that is slower but toast evenly. Takes about 4 times longer then the Brecille. I do not recomend this toaster for the price."
1,Careless Construction and Design,"We returned the toaster two times because of lever disfunction. We are going to return the third one with LCD failure. Is that coincidence?The operability is mediocre as is the appearance, different from the other Breville products we own and like."
1,Disappointing.,"This toaster worked well and toasted consistenly. Then suddenly it stopped working after 17 mos of use There doesn't appear to be a short, it simply won't toast."
2,Doesn't Last,"We got the 4 slice version for a wedding gift. Overall, we were satisfied - it toasted well and I liked the lift feature. It did run a little hot - we never went past setting 3. It lasted about 3 years and then the filiment stopped working on one side, rendering that side useless. One side still does work, allowing us to toast 2 slices of bread, but I expected higher quality from Breville. Not a long-lasting product."
4,"So far, so great. . .","I've always used toaster ovens for their flexibility, but the last one(though a great mini-oven) took forever to toast. I read gazillion reviews and settled on this one because of the consistency of reviews and some of the features of this model.It gets very even toasting in under a minute, and I've not even tried any setting above a '4'. I've used the bagel setting - works as advertised. I've found I need to use the warming setting before toasting those frozen toaster strudels in order to get the filling warm without over toasting the pastry. It does a great job on English muffins, where the extra lift is really useful for getting smaller things out. The only reason I've not given this a 5 star rating is that I simply haven't had it long enough to comment on how it will hold up, and since this isn't a cheap toaster, I consider that important."
2,Don't waste your money!,"I haven't owned a good toaster for years. I thought buying a more expensive toaster like Breville (I paid $79.99 at William Sonoma) would be the solution. Within one month the machine toasted only one side of the bread in one slot. When looking down into that slot while toaster is on, i can see some of the grills are not red. I use the other slot now but cannot seem to find a good setting: setting the dial at 3 and above burns the toast, setting the dial at 2 and under doesn't toast it enough. i now set it to number 2. when it pops up i turn the bread over and set it back in on number 1 but i have to watch it or it will burn parts of the bread. we toast one piece at a time in our 2 slot toaster. Technology allows us to send a man to the moon but we can't make a decent toaster? I am still looking for a toaster that works. I've read good review on a Kitchen Aid model."
2,Died after two years...,"Great product. It toasts well and looks good in my kitchen. I like the little digital display and indicator on how much time is left to toast. I haven't done anything other than sliced bread, but it looks like it will handle bangles and muffins easily.UPDATE:A little more than two years later after light use, the toaster died on me today. The electronics apparently died; the toaster darkness setting number stopped showing up, and it now won't allow anything to be toasted.I think a toaster should last more than 2 years of light use. I'm still keeping it at two stars because it was really good while it worked. :-("
1,Horrible Alarm Sounds When Toast Is Ready. Why???,This is a beautiful toaster that works great.We received it as a wedding present.I would give this toaster five stars except that it has an ALARM built into it that goes off whenever your toast is ready.It beeps LOUDLY four or five times.It sounds like a fire alarm.There is NO WAY to turn off or adjust the alarm feature.It's really a stupid feature because the alarm doesn't solve a problem.I know my toast is up when I hear it pop up. Duh!No one needs a freakin' toaster alarm. TOAST IS NEVER AN EMERGENCY!!!
1,"Nice looking, but quality issues make it not worth the price","I'm shopping for a new toaster on Amazon right now and when I saw my old toaster I couldn't help but write a review. I bought this toaster about two years ago and the quality just isn't there. It certainly looks nice when it's new. However, there are little plastic circles that light up around the various switches that, due to the heat of the toaster itself, started fracturing and chipping off a long time ago. The digital display is far too finicky - just when you think you have it on the right number, simply letting go of the dial can raise it up or down a number. That's more work than needed for a slice of toast. Finally, mine stopped working about 6 months ago due to an internal piece of metal twisting. I twisted it back and it worked until this morning, when it stopped working for a different reason <sigh>. For $90 I expect a toaster to work for five years plus. I couldn't recommend anyone buy this toaster."
5,Great Toaster,This toster is everything we had hoped it would be. Not only toast well but looks good in our new kitchen. Check feature and single side toasting is nice. You spend a little more but it is worth the price.
4,Great Toaster!,"First the looks:This is a very stylish toaster, If your tastes run toward the sleek and modern. The knobs and buttons are very straight forward and user friendly and I really love the lift and look feature allowing you to sneak a peek at you toast without having to start the cycle over again. Overall the whole unit feels well built and I am very pleased with the performance. 4 stars only cause I have only had it for a month and have only used it a few times."
1,"Am returning this toaster, don't like it","I don't like that it beeps when it's done toasting. The LED setting on the front is hard to read (for example, the 3 looks like an 8, the 1 looks like a 7). It toasts unevenly. The blue cancel light and the LED on the front are piercingly bright. I can't put long pieces of bread in it. Even toasting on 3 burns my bread. The lift and look feature is nice and the toaster looks pretty but that doesn't begin to make up for all of the things I don't like about it."
1,After 3 years I dont recommend this toaster,"I purchased this toaster 3 years ago because it looked great and seemed to be of high quality. It was not inexpensive, but soon after purchasing I noticed a few key failures and flaws that make it impossible for me to recommend. First problem: the toast guides for each slot fell off their tracks (at different times). I fixed them a few times, but the track never worked properly. Second problem: after about 6 months the toaster became permanently stuck in ""bagel"" mode and only toasted one side of the bread. I compensate for this failure by toasting my bread twice.I'm not sure there are good toasters out there anymore, but I can say that this is NOT one of the few good toasters available on the market."
1,Very displeased,"It looks great, but this toaster can't toast! The bread is always underdone the first batch and burnt the next batch (at the same setting). The bread shoots out after it's done, often flying to another part of my counter and leaving a trail of crumbs in the process. This toaster is stylish but useless."
2,Breville review,"The design is great, the function is not. Always difficult to get both in the same package! I'm going to return it. It toasts unevenly. Toast is not crisp & it burns a corner of the toast."
4,Great Toaster,"Having owned a Breville latte machine for four years, which I love, and a Breville blender, I decided to go with the 2-slice toaster. Breville products are classy-looking, work great and the customer service I have experienced has been outstanding.The toaster would have received five stars except for some reason it doesn't toast my breadmaker bread as evenly as it does store-bought loves. So I would give it 4 and 1/2 if I could.I often make garlic bread using butter and garlic powder and when I put it in the toaster on the bagel setting it comes out perfect. The butter side toward the center gets melted and just a bit toasted and the un-buttered side comes out the same.The toaster has been excellently reviewed by others and has some great features like the ""lift and check"" without canceling, the L.E.D. countdown timer as a part of the toast control, and the lighted cancel button.Another great and competitively priced addition to my kitchen."
3,Prefer our old Cuisinart toaster,"We are very disappointed in this toaster for three reasons. It does an OK job on bagels, but toast comes out with one side much darker than the other. It also is slow. However, the weirdest thing is that the setting changes on its own from what you set. The first time it happened, I thought that I made a mistake, but it has happened numerous times to both my husband and me. Unfortunately, it moves up one setting and on a couple of occasions, I've had to throw the toast out because it was much too dark for me. We haven't decided yet if we should return it. My old Cuisinart did a much better job; I just wanted a stainless steel toaster instead of white and thought, based on reviews, that this would be better."
5,"So far, the best toaster I have ever owned","After two failures, one Cuisinart and the other I don't even remember, this one is finally ""Quality"". I hope it will last. I think it will."
5,Great toaster....would buy again,"Really like this toaster, it does a great job and also looks good.Would recommend this to anyone looking for a good toaster."
5,Far better than the Russell Hobbs it replaced,"Breville builds small kitchen appliances the way they used to be built -- simple and reliable. The price is worth it. I was gifted a Breville panini maker and this toaster is the second Breville product I am very pleased to own. I've had the toaster for about years and it has already outlasted other expensive brands (e.g., Russell Hobbs). I will buy Breville appliances again but I know I won't need another toaster for years."
5,what can you say about patti labelle... she's the best,"I love this woman. No one sings like she can. She truly is the standard. And this is her best album in a long time. It's classic Patti. The only album better than this is _I'm in Love Again_. My favorites are Someone Like You, and When You Talk About Love."
3,Slow Love Songs Album,"I can't knock Patti's performance on this CD, because she really sings fine here. But all the slow songs I find very indistinguishable from one another on here. The highlight is the funky jam WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT LOVE, without a doubt an absolute classic where Patti gets down. But don't expect anything like it on here, 'cause all the rest are slow adult contemporary songs. FLAME is nice, and a few others are too, but it's not very exciting. Overall, there is very much a sameness here, and not the variety of funk, R&B and love songs that Patti excels at on almost all her releases. I was very disappointed with her MCA releases after WINNER IN YOU, BE YOURSELF and BURNIN' - all top classic albums that have a really great mix of funky tracks, as well as ballads. Too bad that FLAME doesn't have a few more upbeat songs to pick up the pace."
5,"""Flame"" should get much more airplay!","Patti fans pay particular attention to ""If By Chance."" This is the way a song should be sung. Listen and take lessons Mary J. Blige, Brandy, Celine Dion, Mya, Faith Evans, Debra Cox, Monica, and all of you other new-fangled, no-singing wanabees. Patti LaBelle is the Ultimate Diva: bar none! Shame on all of you radio stations that push all of these non-singing young newcomers and won't play music from the Diva of Divas, Patti LaBelle. Be strong Patti fans! Keep her ""Flame"" ""Burnin'. Sang Miss Patti!"
5,Great Gift,I purchased this game for my grandson and he started to play it almost from the moment it was unwrapped.
3,Not just Nature amok,"There have been many tales of Nature striking back at man. This is and is not one of them. It uses some of the ideas from the genre but in ways that are totally new.As we delve into the lives of various characters (in a Stephen King or Ray Bradbury fashion) we see occasional attacks and menacings by bees and birds. Eventually the plot lines tie together as we find out who is on what side in the battle of good and evil.This is sort of a cross between a nature goes wild story and Stephen King's The Stand. Not a story for everyone as it does get a little weird, but a good and unpredictable tale."
1,"bad, BAD book","If a flock of birds stripping a person to bones in seconds, uncomfortable sex scenes and instantly reversing mutations (when the ""bad guy"" is killed of course) make perfect sense to you? Then this is your book."
3,The Birds and the Bee's.....I Dare Say!,"Well...Where do I start? Some people will like this book and some people will probably hate it. I doubt anybody will just love it! I fall somewhere in between. I will let other's get more into the plot and the characters, but let me say this...This book has some birds and bees'alright, but mostly in the sexual vernaculer. I must warn you there is a lot of sexual content in this book. The Birds and the Bee's after all has a double meaning here. The little bugger's are attacking everybody that's for sure while the characters are attacking each other [know what I mean?] I was not offended myself but I know some readers will be. Ms. Giron really pushes the envelope between horror and porn. Not a great book but I do recommend it, for it is a easy read overall and did hold my attention for some reason?"
4,"It's ok, not great","The picture has that LCD grainyness. Probably because the screen is so large. My laptop has a much better picture, but it is 1900pixels wide in 17 inches and thus is denser.The lack of height adjustment is a big negative. Also, it has speakers, but you can't easily replace the clutter of your old speakers with them because there is no headphone jack (at least that I can find).On the plus side, it is cheap for the resolution."
4,Two sides of Ella,"THE GOLD COLLECTION * ELLA FITZGERALD starts off with seven in-concert LP to CD dubs. Sound quality is excellent, with little extraneous noise or distortion. These FINE TUNE label discs offer no liner notes, so its difficult to date this event-- best guess is mid-1970s. Fitzgerald's voice is still sweet, the program's solid, and the small group in perfect support make these performances a pleasure to listen to.The second half of the CD consists of much older records-- some of Ella's earliest big band-era 78 sides. Fidelity is a bit limited, but not by any means inferior. The contrast here between the young and older singer is interesting.TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 42:33"
5,great for sore neck at work,these are getting harder to find and I'm not sure why. glad amazon has them available. lifesaver for my sore neck at work.
2,Fast and frenzied storytelling,"I carefully selected this tape and looked forward to playing it for my child. We didn't even listen to the entire tape. Both the music and storytelling was very fast--some may consider it animated, but the look on my daughter's face was pretty pained. She kept repeating that it was too fast. I had her sit through three stories, hoping that they would eventually slow down. She asked me to turn it off, PLEASE!!!!"
1,It is noisy,"It is noisy and hard to understand because of all the back groud sounds.If you want to have a head ache buy it, if not find something with a lower tune.total waste of money..."
2,Unimpressive,"The author managed to keep my attention for most of the book, but at times his train of thought was very hard to follow. At other times,it was difficult to remember where exactly he was, geographically. This wasn't because he was travelling on a train, but because he'd say he was in Las Vegas, yet then talk about being in Mexico. A little bit too much introspection & ""a hobo is this"" and ""a man is that"" type of advice.The portion of the book where he's actually living among other hobo's is interesting. Unfortunately about 1/3 is devoted otherwise. (including the Glossary)"
3,"Mediocre literature, but a quick read","As a young man currently tramping about the country, I was interested in seeing how the freight-train riders get by (personally, I hitch-hike, and avoid the alcohol that so many bums use to lubricate their journeys). Cotton's written a moderately interesting guide to his travels, including anecdotes of stealing feedcorn and being chased by rednecks (always great additions to any hobo story). He supplements this with a useful glossary of slang.However, his tale lacks the kind of magic that can be found in similar & related sagas, such as (the not as well-written) Into The Wild, and (the phenomenal) The Last American Man, both of which contain dumpster-diving exploits and idealism that leave Cotton in the dust."
4,"A great chance to hop a train, or at least think about it.","I've been around hobos and train hoppers for some time now. Living in Kansas City and Denver like I have you can get used to seeing the huge dirty freight trains roll by in the night to who knows where. Eddy Joe Cotton takes you on a trip aboard those trains, as a close friend would, so you can experience what it's like to look out from a box car as you roll though American heartland cities in the night. He wanders off and sobers up a bit near the end of the book, but that just makes the other 95% of it feel more real than any other train hopping book that I've ever read before. You'll never look at train tracks the same way after this honest and allegorical journal of one man's road less traveled is read."
2,Mediocre at best,"I tried to write a review giving this book only one star, but apparently the Powers That Be don't want it's rating to drop that low. Let me try again. This book is long on attempted profundity and short on anything profound. The author clearly thinks the world of himself, but he doesn't have much to say and overwrites to compensate. I frankly can't fathom the positive review from another reader unless someone is flacking for the author to boost sales. I really wanted to like this book, and I was really disappointed. Don't waste your time. It has less to do with hobos than it does to do with the author's coming of age, but if this book is any indication he has a way to go yet."
2,No Gems Here,"I am a longtime Govi fan and have all of his CD's. That said, I have to agree with Amazon.com's editorial review of this CD. The two traditional Govi cuts on this release are darn good, but not among his best. The rest of the songs are, to me, filler material lacking a distinctive melody that do not generate any inner feelings, good or otherwise. The recording quality of ""Jewel Box"" is top notch. My overall conclusion: Govi has abandoned his great trademark sound for something that doesn't quite deliver. I sure hope that this is only a one-time experiment. George M -- Phoenix, AZ"
5,New twist on this genre of music.,"I almost did not purchase this album due to the editorial review, but I am happy I decided to buy it. I have just started listening to this genre of music and there are many fine artists, however, after a while it all starts to sound the same. Govi infuses the genre with a new twist by using electric guitar, sitar, keyboard, etc. to produce a sophisticated and smooth sound. I enjoy every track on the album. This is perfect when you are stuck in traffic, working around the house, or just want to relax. He is truly an artist who is not afraid to experiment and try new things. The result is beautiful."
3,watch little ones carefully,"our 1 year old loved playing in this, but she would stand up and lean on the sides. I will tip easily. Stay close until they understand gravity!"
2,Dora ball pit,I bought this for my 1-year old niece and nephew and they LOVED it... but it popped at the seam just after a week of having it.
4,Excellent for casual fans looking for his signature songs--,"Also, for people looking for a sampling of 90's crossover rap-- despite the gangsta-heavy themes, Coolio seemingly had no problems with making it onto radio and video rotations, and his real-life persona was always inviting and articulate-- unlike some of his peers who felt like they had to live up to a thuggish image, Coolio thankfully avoided, for the most part, any major run-ins with the law after his career took off.. Since then, though, he's severed his ties with Tommy Boy-- which is why this compilation is receiving a ""quiet"" release-- and Coolio runs his own indie label where he plans to release a new album stateside (it's already out overseas). ..."
5,A random 4-Pack but worth it for Ninth & Altered,"This is a great way to get the DVD copy of The Ninth Configuration, previously its DVD release from WB has been out of print for a while and the price even used has been outrageous. Out comes this release to save the day, it makes for a great double feature with Blatty's Exorcist III (Legion) or ALtered States, but the inclusion of Dead Calm and Just Cause is very random. Just Cause is a very good thriller (with a side part where Ed Harris' psycho character does a better job at looking/acting like Batman villain Zsasz than the character was presented in the disappointing Batman Begins!) but Dead Calm is a bit of a drag, but worth a watch to see a great performance from the great Billy Zane.I found my copy for $7 New, for this bargain release William Peter Blatty and Ken Russell fans can rejoice!"
5,Ninth Configuration et al,"I purchased this set to secure the hard to find ""Ninth Configuration"" written & directed by William Peter Blatty (author of the ""Exorcist"". Ninth was titled ""Twinkle Twinkle Killer Kane"" when I first saw it as a young teenager when it was originally released. I had forgotten how funny the first half was but DID remember the powerful ending. Getting ""Altered States"" is a happy bonus!Te duisc was inexpensive & arrived timely."
4,......the best DVD value on Amazon,"***** My vote for the best DVD value on Amazon *****Four great classic thrillers, good enough to own individually.All movies are 2.4:1 aspect ratio,,except for Altered States which is 1.85:1Movies are on just two disks, that alone is why 4 stars.Nevertheless, get it now!!"
5,Wonderful.,"This is wonderful, soothing music. I play it daily in my office as background. It helps easy my worried mind. (It is not insipid elevator music, nor the generic windham hill type). It is so good that I am thinking of buying a second disk for home."
5,"soothing, stress-reducing, un-obtrusive, fantastic!",my new favorite cd. i play it all the time in the background. i have generalized anxiety and it has helped me emensely with calming my breathing and heartbeat. i recommend it highly.
5,A Real PI,"As a former private-eye, I remember the long hours, the tedious work, the mundane cases. I remember the details. James R. Winter knows PIs as few writers do and knows how to take the mundane and make it interesting, take the tedious deeds and make us want more, take Cleveland and make you want to go there ... right now. He flat-out writes a damn good yarn. Nick Kepler is the most realistic private-eye to come along in a years.NORTHCOAST SHAKEDOWN has enough plots twists, body heat, sex and violence to dare the reader to stop reading. It is a non-stop roller-coaster ride of cases colliding with cases, of hot women, tough guys and a PI to remember."
1,"I love this genre, but found it hard to tolerate this movie","Let me start by stating emphatically that I love old movies like these. I like them when they get a little corny, so having read the five star review of this movie, currently there is only one, I thought this movie was for me.After having watched it, I feel victimized. This movie is terrible. The picture quality, the sound quality, the plot, the acting, (except William Bendix) is all awful.I'm not sure how anyone without a financial interest in the sale of this DVD could give this movie five stars. I'm trying not to sound rude. I'm not accusing anyone, but I don't understand. I'm just being honest.Run away from this movie. Save your money. You'll be disappointed."
5,A movie I remembered.,I remembered watching this movie as a kid and wanted to add it to my WWII movie collection. Good movie and good plot. I really enjoyed it.
3,deep six,I was a little disapointed because it looked like a copy of a copy. The quality was not as good as I am used to.
3,Sparks!,"You'll find yourself recommending The Ultimate Test to your friends. Catherine Schuett wastes no time in lighting the fuse and hooking her reader. Her hero, although not perfect, is a true hero and her villain is bad to the bone--her cast of characters shine.Fueled by guilt, Kyle Irons' quest is to rescue three seemingly unconnected people kidnapped by underworld boss, Antonio Cartillone, Jr. and brought to his private tropical island. The captives, including Irons, face a series of deadly games for Cartillone's ghoulish pleasure--games in which they must work through their personal differences in order to survive ""the ultimate test"" or perish.Ms. Schuett's storytelling gifts are in top form with The Ultimate Test, a complex, thoughtful and very exciting book-a rousing ride to the end.Reviewer: Donna E. Bedrick...."
3,it's better than the other guy says,"I'd have disagree a bit with the other review that pans this CD.Sure it has it's ""over-produced"" problems at times - but overall, I thought this was a pretty good album - solid songwriting and strong vocals. well worth checking out IF, you've already got the rest of the 1960's Grape catalog."
3,Disappointing,"The best thing about these condoms is the smell. After that it all goes down hill from there. The ribbed base does not add pleasure it can cause bleeding for the woman. The condom does not stay on and is generally too slack when things really get heated. Save your jokes about size for someone else. Unless you are Mandigo or thicker than Ricco, these condoms do not have the hold they need to get the job done. However, if your partner simply cannot stand the smell of latex, these are the condoms for you. Other than that I cannot recommend them."
2,Disappointing,"I didn't find this any ""snugger"" than standard condoms. I thought I'd give this a try, but I will go back to the LifeStyles Snugger Fit since it is a better fit. I am also irritated that the package doesn't look like what is pictured here or say it is the snugger fit style (although stamped on the back is ""Enhanced Pleasure"") so I can only assume I was sent the correct product."
2,Painfully Tight,"I got these in a sampler pack, and I'm still a little sore. They were painfully constrictive. I consider myself average, so beware."
3,Great for the new chess player,"This chess book is great for beginners. It shares the history of chess. It reviews many former chess world champions. There is not enough information, regarding opening chess moves, for an average chess player."
5,Thank you!,"This book has been wonderful for my 8 year old son. I've seen his game improve immensely! He's playing more defensively, knows a bit of history about chess, AND snuck a win against Granddad the other night. I approve!"
3,Not the best but alright,"I was excited to see this because I was getting bored with the Frieza Saga. It wasn't as good as I hoped it would be. There were some funny parts in it. As much as I hate Krillin I was glad to see he got a girlfriend, even though she was a little strange. Garlic Jr wasn't impressing at all. Even though I own this I wouldn't recommend this for everyone. If you aren't pleased with this tape don't ditch the whole saga. The other two tapes are better."
5,black water mist,This was a very great dbz movie a great movie for a collecter.There is a new begining before the show and evan kerillan has a girlfriend.I can't what till i get the next movie.
4,Garlic Bad As Ever,"These episodes are great because they show how time has passed since the battle with Frieza. Gohan is older and all of Earth's fighters are much stronger. These episodes include Gohan, Piccolo, Kame, and Krillen with the return of the evil Garlic Jr. Garlic Jr. is trying to take over the world and kill Earth's fighters with making them fight against their friends. I would say this was a perfect time to bring back Garlic Jr."
2,WAS NOT IMPRESSED!,"WHY MUST YOU ASK? WELL, AFTER SEEING THE LAST EPISODES, THIS SEEMED WIMPY. I MEAN, GOHAN BEAT THIS GUY WHEN HE WAS 5 YEARS OLD AND WAS STRONGER THAN GOKU, IN THE FIRST MOVIE. AND AFTER FACING FRIEZA THIS GUY SHOULD BE A ... ANT IN COMPARISON. IM SO SURE 3 OF THE WORLDS GREATEST FIGHTERS THAT FOUGHT SO MANY BATTLES AN CAME OUT ALIVE AND STRONGER EACH TIME. GARLIC OUGHT TO BE A BIG PUSH OVER TO THESE GUYS. BUT ITS AS IF THE Z FIGHTERS HAVE WIMPED OUT. SORRY TO BE SAYING THIS TO ANY DBZ FAN BUT DONT BUY THIS ONE. IM A BIG DBZ FAN MYSELF AND HAVE ALL EPISODES UP TO GARLIC. AND I WOULD HAVE TO SAY ITS THE WORST IVE SEEN YET. JUST HARD TO COMPARE TO THE FRIEZA SAGA WITCH TOTALLY ROCKS. GOOD TO WATCH ONE TIME MAYBE, BUT DONT INVEST IN A COPY YOU WONT WATCH IT AGAIN BELEIVE ME. AT LEAST THE TRUCKS SAGA HAS STARTED, NOW DO INVEST IN IT. WELL WORTH THE MONEY. THANK YOU! DBZ FANS"
1,A horible DBZ movie,I own this movie and every DBZ movie that is out in America and ive seen all of the Cell games in English edited. I would have to say this is the worst movie i have seen and the same with the rest of the Garlic Jr. saga. I only bought it becuase i plan on buying all of the tapes. But if your not like that and you just want some good tapes get the sayian saga or androids to cell. I would have to say the best part in this movie is when Vegita is on other planets looking for Goku but that is very short. Don't get me wrong I love DBZ i just do not like this saga at all.
3,not bad,"this book is about experimental cars that were made by various auto companies. the info is somewhat out of date, but tells a lot about a branch of cars that are largely unresearched. sometimes the wording is simplistic and seems to be geared towards children."
2,Grandparent's revenge,"My son's grandparents gave him this horribly NOISY thing! It creates the same LONG annoying ""chainsaw"" noises continuously. It's highly motion sensitive and the worst thing is there is no volume control! His grandparents just laugh and say it's their revenge for all my noisy toys. Save your sanity - run away from this toy!"
3,82%,"Most of the book is a great intro to money, stocks, bonds and mutual funds. But the last section, on Futures & Options, seems really rushed and lacks the clarity of the earlier sections (especially the material on options). For example, the authors do not define ""calling"" or ""putting"" options; and there is a blatant error on page 150 wherein a description of an option table is laughably out of sync with the table it is trying to describe.Overall, the book is very good -- just beware of the shortcomings of its last section."
4,To get the whole picture,I think this book did a great job in helping me understand the universe of money and investing beyong the scope of stock. I have been trading for 1 year and wanted to buy a small book that gave me a general education on the subject. Although much more can be written on each topic covered it is good for beginning to understand the whole picture.
4,"Love the Stories, but what happened to Tyrone's voice in the first episode?","My sons - 3.5 and 23 months - love this new DVD. My older one's new favorite episode is Flower Power and my younger boy's new favorite is Funnyman Boogeyman, which he repeats with glee. My spouse and I also love all four of these episodes as we do the many others in our DVD collection. Backyardigans has so much to offer with catchy songs in different genres each episode, dancing that keeps all of us moving, and clever stories. The only thing that doesn't work for this video is that Tyrone's voice in Follow the Feather is off. Either the actor who portrays him was ill in a way that significantly affected his voice, or the producers substituted another actor who tried unsuccessfully to duplicate Tyrone's voice. I hope the original actor has not left the series for some reason. His voice is wonderful and clearly too hard to duplicate."
1,Content is well protected,"The shows are fine, what isn't OK is the media errors on the disks. The copy protection makes it unable to be played on a PC and causes errors in playback on my DVD player. Its a pitty since the episodes seem cute."
3,"You need a Fisher Price ""Power Touch"" system with this.",I purchased this for my son who loves Rescue Heroes thinking it was a book with sound. I was mistaken and I need another unit from Fisher Price to make it work. The unit needed is similar to the Learning Leap Pad that sits on the kids' lap and they have to plug in a cartridge. Just be aware of that before you buy it so you know what you are getting.
4,Not bad at all,"Even though the Garlic Jr Saga is nothing compared to the Frieza Saga it doesn't mean it is bad. This saga is probably the most interesting one. I knew exactly what to expect in the Trunks Saga. Gohan kicks some but in this video. Garlic Jr has a bad laugh. The Spice Boys seem strange, but don't get me wrong that doesn't mean they are weak. Krillin was pathetic in this video. Vegeta continues his search for Goku. Piccolo shows no mercy to Gohan. The last episode was a surprise. This is worth getting."
3,"A rather boring, filler saga...","This saga was really short, lasting only a couple of episodes. Although it was kinda nice to see a lot more action with Piccolo, Gohan and Krillin, because Goku had just defeated the previously strongest fighter in the universe.The plot needed some more development, and you won't really know much about Garlic Jr. unless you view the film ""Dead Zone"", which explains a lot about his past and why he wants revenge on Gohan.Otherwise, this saga is okay, for the Trunks saga follows this one."
3,Need a magnifying glass,"As a dictionary, I would rate it 5. It has everything you want. BUT, it gets a 3 because it is very difficult to read without a magnifying glass (or perhaps strong reading glasses would help)."
2,Not impressed,"The print is exceedingly small. Very difficult to read. Be warned if you are over 50 and need reading glasses as you will find it a strain. Paper is of poor quality - that kind of brownish tint that makes the print hard to distinguish and the poor quality of paper that will begin to yellow soon. I purchased a paperback Larousse in France that has more extensive definitions, grammar information, usage examples, etc. Not only are the definitions more extensive and useful but the paper is of a good quality, very white, making the print easier to read. The print is of a decent size, with the word in blue and the definitions of a clear, sharp font. I was planning to give this Cassell's dictionary as a gift to someone trying to learn English but am sorry it is of such poor quality and has less expanded information."
5,Great Dictionary!,This was a great dictionary. It was easy to find and understand the definitions listed!
1,"Junk, pure and simple(or a shiny paper weight).","After reading others' words of praise about this item, I decided this was the gift to give my girlfriend for her birthday. Well, it arrived this afternoon and I simply had to tell everyone TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS THING! It didn't work for even a second after she took it out of the package. Tried using the AC adapter, and the message ""disc"" popped up on the display. Well, there was a disc in there, my friend. Tried a different disc...same result. Tried using batteries...nothing. The disc never even spun one revolution. Granted, these kinds of things do happen and I understand that. I just wanted to share our experience with this brand with other customers. I'm going to buy her an Aiwa first thing in the morning."
5,Very good deal,"My brother owns a very good Sony CD player that he is alwaysbragging about. ... . He was telling me that I didn't have enough money for a good CD player. I proved him wrong. As soon as I showed him an ad for this one, he said, ""Koss? Are you crazy?"" I bought this CD player from Amazon and I really enjoy it. It puts out a really good sound, the extra bass sound adds a lot of bass, it has awesome headphones, and the car pack lets the whole family listen to CDs in the car. It has never skipped with ASP on, and it even has good skip protection without the ASP on. This player hasn't yet given me any problems, and it is all for an incredible price. My brother can't believe my CD player. Even though he doesn't want to admit it, my CD player is actually better than his."
2,Looks nice but is not good,"I got this cd player for my birthday and I thought it looked nice and it was a pretty color, but I used it once and after playing three songs it wasn't playing anything, although it was still on. I sent it back to the company and they sent me back another, but it was the wrong one and it is totally ugly!I wouldn't buy one of these again, I don't trust the company."
5,grab bar,I bought this for my wife whos health is going down hill. installed in the hall to help her so she doesn't take falls . it works very well
4,Billie Gold,"The GOLD COLLECTION offers a wide selection of jazz, blues and big band artists at affordable prices. Source material can vary from fair to very good. CDs have a slightly yellow tint, in keeping with the ""gold"" theme. These albums come with no liner notes.The first five tracks of BILLIE HOLIDAY * THE GOLD COLLECTION feature Lady Day and a small backing group in a live setting, from what appear to be good fidelity radio transcriptions. Surface imperfections are minimal. On the next two, Holiday performs with a large band, also live. The balance of the set is again vocal with minimal accompaniment; most tracks include audience. All songs on this album are nicely done by one of the luminaries of blues and jazz, Miss Billie Holiday.TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 37:07"
5,An outstanding aero book,"I have recently studied the 2009 edition. First, I confess prejudice, since he references my work on airfoils. But this is a truly excellent volume, well written, well illustrated, virtually without equations and correct in every respect. I could not find a single item that was wrong, or even required more precise expression. I expect that readers who do not have college aerodynamics may find it a little abstruse. But the truth is seldom simple.Most of the reviews give good, useful descriptions of the content. It is a pity that one reviewer was so totally ignorant as to knock the book because it ""used Bernoulli for airfoil lift""!! The book he quotes as a basis for this nonsense is actually incorrect, and is widely known as a joke in the professional business. It is sad how definite fools may be. And how harmful!"
4,Good explanation of aerodynamic basics,"This books gives a good qualitative explanation of the aerodynamic basics. Calculations are left in the appendix, so the mathophobics will not be intimidated. It debunks myths such as the ""dive test"". The only bad thing about this book is a few typos on graphs that can be rather confusing."
2,bought to use for rc design but it wasn't really useful,I bought this book to help design some rc plane stuff. Of all the books i bought this book was probably the least useful. It doesn't really explain much of what you think it would.
4,MORE HELIS AND ROCKETS,I THINK THAT IT COULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAILED IN HELICOPTERS SUBJECTS AND HAVE SOME CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT ROCKETS Aerodynamics.
4,great book for the novice and expert alike,While I have not read this text cover to cover it appears to be a great find. I have a graduate degree in engineering and this book seems to be perfect for anyone interested in how their model flies. I hope to use some of the concepts in this text for my graduate student projects. You cannot go wrong with this one.
5,Finally!,"I liked Ekko from the CD Sunset Magic North - with the amazing Mossman Elongation, what a beautiful creation - and since I keep looking for one of his own CDs. Not dissapointed from the samples. Thank you, Amazon, I will be checking to see if some more Ekko shows up here.KA"
1,Disappointed,"I used the product for years,than made the mistake of upgrading to a newer version. I guess in their desire to rush something new to the market it had bugs in it. The customer support is the worst I have ever experienced bar none. There is absolutly no one to call unless you want to pay per minute charge or chat on the internet. After two hours of holding on the chat service I got dumped by a busy server. The telephone people will not discuss anything without a credit card number. They should sell a service policy if they don't want to offer customer service. What a gross experience."
2,Unpleasantness,"1. The manual is a shill for spending more money on web services you don't need. It is among the most vague things I've ever tried to use.2. There are obvious glitches in the file management tools. This frightens me -- this is my livelihood, after all, and not some game. The IRS will not let me blame Quicken if I make a major mistake.3. Very disappointing, grinding experience on the learning curve. Extremely un-inutive, Intuit."
2,buggy,"Lost my data a few times with this one. Since I know my way around a hard drive, I've been able to recover. Wouldn't buy this one but what choices do you have....MS Money. Same ballgame."
3,Best from 1970 - 1975.,"This is their ""best"" '70 thru '75 (There's The Rub), although they inexplicably throw in 1 good song (""Living Proof"") from a good 1980 album (Just Testing). This album is also good because of the excellent liner notes which chronicle the band's history, up thru 1991. An important slice of 70's Rock history. A good way for new fans to test the waters before buying their early albums (Argus, There's the Rub, Pilgrimage). Nothing from W.Ash IV here, probably due to lack of room. [I wish this were a double album.]"
5,REALLY REALLY THE BEST ALBUM,I couldn't say anything...I forgot the words. JUST LISTEN IT AND TOU CAN FEEL.....
5,love it,perfect. just what we were looking for. happy to find it. sent fast and price was right. will use again
4,For My Grandchild: A Grandmother's Gift of Memory (AARP),"Lineage page did not seem complete to allow for both sets of great grandparents, otherwise I liked it very much"
3,An heirloom for the grandkids,"A collection of questions and spaces for photos that act as a useful prompt for grandparents to record all those things that a grandchild might wonder about later in life.Nicely presented, but I worry about the paper sleeve over the hardcover getting torn. Also, it would be nice to provide pockets for photos rather than just spaces.The questions are good and far ranging however some are USA-specific, for example: 'who was president...'.All in all a worthwhile purchase."
3,"Not wonderful, but not horrible.","I just want to say, that for those of you saying this is awful, well, you're right to an extent. The singer here isn't the best singer, however there are some parts where she sounds almost like Any Lee. And until you go and listen the tribute to Godsmack you're not allowed to bash this!!! Alright this right here is some good stuff compared the Godsmack tribute. Godsmack is my favorite band in the whole world, the guy on that sounds like a bloody deadite from Evil Dead! If you go and listen the Godsmack tribute album and then listen to this again, I think you'll have more appreciation for this album."
3,it roxxxxxx,i was never an evanescence fan really and i don't believe that band needs a tribute but i'm surprised for this release!! it's a must for all those like that music!!enjoy it!!
1,Somebody. Please. Help.,"Okay. This is the first time I've heard Amy's songs slaughtered like that. ><! I mean, come on. They cannot mimic Evanescence if they wanted to-Not the vocals (Who can?) not the music(Way off), Not anything. In truth, instead of feeling like some down-to-earth person, I felt like I was on a tropical island from hearing the PREVEIWS. x.x Going Under and Imaginary were cut the worst, I think.. But that's me, I favor the two. I'm sorry. Just. Don't buy the CD."
1,Disgusting,"This is the WORST thing I have ever heard!!What is the matter with that girl!?Has she no shame!!I just don't understand how they could produce and market this AWFUL thing!I swear to you I truly felt sick just listening to the previews of this cd.I'm telling you I just wanted to smack her!I am telling you this girl has no telant!i'm not even compairing her to Amy Lee!All I have listened to was the previews,and I happy to say I didn't waste my money and buy this cd!"
1,this sucks,Don't listen just go look for something else! Tribute?HA! Whoever is singing's voice is no where near Amy Lee's and it just isn't even worth giving a second glance.
1,Sucks,"Never even baught it, never will. flat out sucks. Total disgrace to evanescence. The only ones id ever concider to listen to is hello and perfect."
1,O-M-G!,"OMG I mean she has messed up this cd so bad...I mean its bad that I can sing better then this chickI can't believe how badly she did on MY Immortal!I'm with you all DON""T BUT THIS CD!~MelP.S It's not even worth one star!"
1,Will The artist Kindly Die Of A Slow And Painful Death...,"whe i first listened to this, i was mildly amused to think, ""hmmm, someone likes evanescence enough to make a tribute album"" and then i listened to it and i wanted to be locked in a silent room for the rest of my life.This does not do Evanescence justice for god sake. For a start they need to choose a different singer, and when i say need to, i mean it, she cannot do justice to Amy Lee's amazing vocals, not by a long shot. It just seems like a lazy attempt to milk the cash cow and make as much money out of the evanescence franchise as humanly possible.Evanescence cannot be copied. simple as that, and well if they are, a better effort has to be made."
1,Alvin and the Chipmunks in Paridise???? *Gags*,"Geez, I think the one who mentioned the Tropic sound was not far off. The Previews are enough to make me hang my head in shame. The woman who is not listed on Amazon does not have the range, skill or heart to sing the songs that Amy Lee has put together.There is a major difference between this and Fallen. It's called Blood Sweat and Tears. All the songs that have appeared on Fallen and every other Evanescence album the lyric's and music came from there hearts and when performing they put there hearts into it.This sounds like the woman just stood there and in the most munotnous voice at times sounding like the Chipmunks and attempts to sing these songs. Is this person an American Idol Reject who is trying to make a stab at fame like the person from last year?If you want heart get Fallen."
1,Keebler Elves Tribute?,"Tribute, eh? (term used cautiously) I hope Evanescence is flattered by the sentiment because they can't possibly be impressed by the project itself. I have no intention of being cruel, but the vocals honestly sound like some sort of celtic elf or something. And was it recorded in someone's garage? My personal fave song by Evanescence, ""Hello"" is just slaughtered by the vocalist. Most of the vocals are pitchy at best and most definitely ""whiney"". I kinda dig the prominent percussion (bongo/beatnic-feel) but otherwise this project is really just barely listenable. Great songs done very badly."
1,"OMFG, this album sucks @$$ !!!!","I am a total die-hard fan of Evanescence, and this Cd made me listen to more Evanescence. Ne 1 who isnt into Evanescence should buy this, because it makes u hate the tribute, and want to listen to the real Cd. I give this a 1 out of 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars.DO NOT BUY IT!!"
1,OMG,"DEAR LORD.i saw this, and was like, oooo evanescence. must have. (Im a huge evanescence fan.) I seriously almost threw up when i heard this. Who on earth would have the nerve to BUTCHER evanescence like this? i am about to cry, actually. The instruments suck, the vocals SUCK, i honestly have nothing good to say about it. Go out and buy some medieval torture device instead....theyre about the same on pleasure levels."
2,not sturdy,"My children love this toy, unfortunately we are forever reassembling it. The construction allows for the tool bench to slide apart during play, and the extra ""nuts and bolts shelf"" broke the first few days of play. A great concept, fun accessories, but the bench itself is simply not well made."
3,"Fun, but small and unstable","My 3 year old really enjoys playing on this toy. The wood is good quality, but there are some design flaws. This is a very small workbench. My child is small for his age, but he has to be on his knees to use it. The piece itself doesn't stay together. All of the pieces come together, but they aren't secured. If you go to move this toy, more than likely, a part of it will shift and you will have to do some reassembly, which makes it rather impractical."
2,Cute but doesn't stay together,"this is cute, but it doesn't stay together. The peices just slide in, and then can just fall out. Disappointed :("
5,It's not your ordinary jazz,"Some people think that jazz has already reached its peak and that it's been steadily declining since the 1960s. These people have not listened to Thompson D'earth. ""Mercury"" is a great example of how Jazz Fusion is the wave of the future. These guys blend swing, bebop, Free and avant-garde, creating not your typical type of jazz. They keep your foot tapping and your mind guessing. To fuse it even more they throw in a splash of pop rock with the angelic voice of Dave Matthews on Copeland's ""Darkness"", and Carter Beauford on drums throughout the entire album.This album has become a permanent fixture in my cd player, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys good music. If you want to go a little more raw, check out ""Live at Millers"" - you'll be blown away."
5,Excellent,"This is really beautiful in person. My girlfriend wore it until the string broke, and it's pretty easy to repair if you don't lose the jade beads. The color is really pretty, and I'd definitely recommend this."
3,A bit too short on ideas,"Good book, but more on the general atmosphere of the times, the results of McCarthy's hounding and the fear that stopped so many from standing up to him would have been welcome."
3,it's okay..,"I got this as a christmas gift. However, the big duffle bag was torn after a month of usage. We haven't use the small one much. But the big one doesn't quite live up. I would not recommend this if you plan on using the bag every day."
5,CE Labs 6001 RF Amplier - Review,"I have been having trouble for over two years with poor analog TV quality and Internet cable modem dropping off-line over and over. I have numerous TV/Internet cable outlets all over the house. I finally figured out that because of the number of these cable splitters throughout the house has depleted my signal to a level that the cable modem would not work reliably and TV reception was snowy and of poor quality. After purchasing the CE Labs CE 6001 RF amplifier, all my problems disappeared. The Cable TV analog signals responded to the 20 dB of gain by providing me OUTSTANDING picture quality on my TVs and the Cable Internet signal improved to the point that there are NO drop outs and going off-line. What a great product!! Why don't the cable companies know about these great amplifiers?Dave"
2,Dissappointed,While this unit may be fine for Analog ( NTSC ) Signals.it WILL NOT Boost ( ATSC ) DTV Signals.
1,***ONE BASEBALL***NOT ONE DOZEN***,"$36 FOR ONE BASEBALL. ENOUGH SAID. OTHER USERS HAD THE SAME ISSUE. DO NOT ORDER THIS. REPEAT, I DID NOT RECEIVE ONE DOZEN BASEBALLS...I RECEIVED ONLY 1!!!!!"
1,A $30 batting practice ball???,"I believe this was supposed to be a dozen balls, however, what I received was one, standard, ""made-in-China"" batting practice ball which cost about ten times as much as a single ball of the same quality would be sold at a sporting goods store. It would be a good deal at $29.95 for a dozen, but one ball? Holy moly..."
1,Assumed price was per dozen,"I ordered what I thought was two dozen baseballs (24) and received two baseballs (2). The price I paid is definitely what I typically pay for a dozen balls, so there was clearly an error in processing the order."
2,A different style to the Murmurs,"This CD brings the Murmurs into a very different realm from their first. Mostly gone are the acoustic guitars and harmonizing vocals. Instead you find a fuller band with a drummer and base guitar player. Many of the songs have a hint of country through them.After the near perfection of their first CD, I was disappointed by this one. I get the feelings that Murmurs weren't happy with this CD either, since it ran for only a short period of time and many of the songs are repeated or reworked for their next album. Unless you feel a need to complete your set, I'd say hold back the money from this CD and put it towards their next CD, Blender, instead."
2,"It was the songs, not the cover, the songs","Sorry, this will offend the one-eyed Murmurs fans. I bought this CD when it came out and got dudded. This album was a mistake. I agree ... that perhaps the Murmurs got too carried away trying to do ""the k.d. lang thang"". In fact there was absolutely nothing wrong with the wonderful original sound of their previous album, ""The Murmurs"", which was a beautiful carefree breath of light sweet air. Pristine Smut however is a dank stale stuffy room. There's some space for redemption in some tracks, and it was attempted with the hurried re-do, ""Blender"". But it wasn't enough to lift the mish-mashy production. k.d. lang killed the Murmurs and we're still in mourning."
5,Great,Love it. This book is hold your sides funny. This book gives a new twist tobtge Proverbs 31 woman and makes it revelevent for todays women.
5,Enhanced with more than a hundred photographs,"Saturday Nights With Daddy at The Opry by artist, writer, and photographer Libby Leverett-Crew is the biographical story of country music photographer Les Leverett as told by his daughter. As a little girl, Libby's father would take her along with him on his job as the official photographer for the Grand Ole Opry -- a position he held for over 30 years. This is not only a tribute to her father but also to the people (ranging from Dolly Parton and Minnie Pearl to Roy Acuff and Bill Monroe) who touched the lives of her family and the powerful impact a loving father has on the formative life of his daughter. Enhanced with more than a hundred photographs from her father, Saturday Nights With Daddy At The Opry is enthusiastically recommended reading -- especially for dedicated fans of the Grand Ole Opry."
2,Very dissappointing,"This promises to be something of a backstage look at the Grand Ole Opry, instead it's a more of a personal memoir with comments about country stars the author has known. While she writes quite a bit about Minnie Pearl, Grandpa Jones, Tex Ritter (hence the foreward is written by Tom & John Ritter, shortly before John's death), Dolly Parton, Porter Wagoner, Bill Monroe, Loretta Lynn, and John Hartford, and a few others are pictured and briefly commented on (Marty Stuart, Stringbean, Ricky Skaggs, The Whites, etc.) there are scores of Opry stars that don't even merit a mention. And over 35 of the ""over 100 photographs"" in the book are exclusively of Leverett-Crew's family without a star in the picture! And that's not counting the hefty amount of pictures that are with stars that also picture family members. Too bad the author did not just make this a book a history of her father's career (Les Leverett, a famed country music photographer) instead of this effort."
4,Classic Shabba,"If you know anything about dancehall reggae and you are a fan of Shabba Ranks then you will love this cd. It's basically a compilation of most of Shabba's song's before and after his Epic record deal. That brought him into the whole hip-hop/reggae ""crossover"" period of his career. Just about all of the tracks on the album are strictly dancehall rhythms. Also if you know Shabba then the song titles should be familiar to you, as he's been ramming dancehall from back in the day. My suggestion: BUY THE ALBUM."
4,Task Speciffic Lens,"When I first saw tis lens I was excited about the possibility of converting my coolpix from a 38-115mm to a 114-345mm lens. Since this lens front mounts to the existing lens it vignettes at the wider end of the lens all the way to approx 85mm. Leaving you with an effective approx. range of only 250-345mm. While shooting in this range you better have a lot of light on your subject or a tripod. Otherwise you will get the predictable blurs from using such a long lens hand held. Since the cool pix is not the greatest in low light situations this extender compounds those blur problems. It also blocks the crappy built in flash if you are using it. Another problem you may notice is the size of this converter. It's huge for such a small camera. If you bring your camera for some quick snaps you may not want to lug this lens around.On the plus side this lens is produced with the quality that you expect fron Nikon optics and if you want to get long, this is the ticket."
5,AWESOME.,"I take anywhere from 100-500 pictures in a month. i have used this lens several time. if you are looking to get close to you subject from far this one works great. picture quality is amazing and really is worth the money if you take enough pictues. Bottom line is if you get out enough and love nature like i do, this can't be beat with my nikon 4500."
5,Renews Faith in The Human Race,"I save precious luggage space for this book on my business trips, for it is true, inspiring, and worth savoring. When I read it in lonely hotel rooms at night, I quickly become part of a warm, compassionate, fun-loving and courageous family. I feel like I have arrivied home, perhaps even better than home. Solvig Sedlet inspires me to be my best as she weaves intergenerational and international stories of her and her parents leading their broods through some very tough situations with courage and spirit. Though some sad things happen, this is anything but book about being a victim. Its stories ring with love,life's best victory. In these wearing times of scandals, terroism, wars, and rumors of war, this book renews my faith in the Human race."
5,This is the funniest and most worthwhile book I've read.,"This is a great book with lots of interesting characters and dialogue. The first few books are the best, but not to say all of them aren't good. This is the funniest series of books I've ever read and they make a great, funny conversation topic. Read it ASAP!"
4,Cool book!,This book was the wackiest book Ive ever read. I was almost like talking to one of my Zany friends about inside jokes. Loved it!
5,Marvin is my god,I LOVE IT!!!!! I LOVE IT!!!!!! Probably the best book ever written. Marvin rules. You can't put the book away for one second because it's so funny and exiting!!Read it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,It'd be 5-stars except there's a paperback edition w 2intros,"Well, this book is better than the hype. It's got to be one of the most intelligent (and funny) books of all time. Really. And I'm the type who laughs at Star Trek.Only CAUTION: Don't read the intro before finishing the book. There's a SPOILER in there."
4,"Very funny, Adams was a very gifted writer","I didn't know what to expect from this book and I really didn't want to read it. My cousing kept pestering me to do so and I finally caved in when I was desperate for something to read. I am certainly glad I read this book because Adams is absolutely hilarious. I haven't laughed out loud while reading a book this much ever in my life (I don't read many comedies and this is just great). What is very impressing is the mix of humor and intelligence Adams uses in this book. There are plenty of things that must be read and re-read to understand and its mostly all interesting. As my cousin did to me, I recommend this book strongly - especially if you're not sure you'll like it because you don't know what to expect. Trust me, it's a good surprise."
5,Silly Space,"What a great deal for such an awesomely strange time. I stumbled upon the book a few years ago when I was working a kiosk selling e-readers. Read the first chapter and laughed the entire time. Before this I had never laughed out loud while reading, and a story being told by a guy who absolutely hated writing books, made it all the more enjoyable. A relatively easy read, although there will be those who don't care much for science or dry humor. I find it pretty hilarious as a whole. The greatest five-book trilogy ever!!!"
5,All Time Favourite,"The trilogy of four! - some of my favourite books of all time. I 'discovered' The Hitchhiker's Guide by chance so years back and after that I couldn't wait to read absolutely everything by Adams, I love his narrative style and sense of humour. The journeys he created stayed with me long after the last page was read!"
5,Great Series,"One of the classic Science Fiction series of all times. The British humor is sometimes hard to get but this series will still be around in a hundred years, making people laugh. Buy it!"
5,Very satisfied,"My book arrived very quickly, and was in pristine, new condition, as advertised. I am very happy with the transaction and the item."
5,A masterpiece of Sci-fi,"I haven't read a book funnier than the Hitchhiker's guide. The character's are engaging, and the adventures, though outragous, are very well written. The book can be confusing, but that is one of the things that makes it so funny. In the intro, Douglas Adams explains that the name came to him as he lay drunk in a field in Switzerland, which should give some insight on the contents of the book. Adams has a warped sense of humor and the book is even funnier if you do too."
5,Great presentation for a great story.,"This review is for the leatherbound deluxe edition, not its contents. This volume looks great on the bookshelf, and is much cheaper than comparable editions from somewhere like Easton Press. Good stuff!"
5,Perfect Collection,This puts all the books in one book. Fantastic read. I love the whole series with its humor and wit.
4,Even better on the Kendall fire!,"First book loaded onto the Kendall fire, was even better once I figured out how to make the text-to-speech function work! Also folks this is a much cheaper way of doing it then buying the books on audible.com."
2,"typos, typos galore!","Sorely disappointed that one of my most loved books would be so riddled with typos. This would be completely unacceptable of a printed book, what would make it ok in a Kindle version? I would have liked one of the reviewers to point that out for me before I bought it. I am, of course, keeping it now, but it is infuriating."
5,Sci-Fi Fun,"The Hitchhiker's Guide series is the gold standard for science fiction comedy. This series of books takes the well-established memes from science fiction and turns them all on their heads, and it does so with oodles of little sardonic asides that will leave you choking on your Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters.The series does start to wind down toward the end. You get the impression the author just wants to be done with these characters, but on the whole an excellent series that I've read many times.If you're a fan of humor and science fiction and enjoy quick British wit, this is undoubtedly something for you to check out."
5,So you mean this isn't the afterlife?,"Some people write books that you can, in some strange way, relate to so well, that you become convinced that if you ever met the author, he (or she) would be the most awesome person on the planet. Douglas Adams is, I think, one of those authors. Anyone who can say ""I love deadlines. I love the wooshing sound they make as they go by,"" is someone I'd love to meet.And anyone who writes books as good as The Hitchhiker's Guide and The Restaurant at the End of the Universe is definitely someone I'd love to meet. The entire series is great - you get absolutely submerged in strange occurrences in a weird universe - but the first two of the series are the best. They retain a sense of grand adventure (incredibly strange adventure, anyway) while being absolutely hilarious 90% of the time. All I'm gonna say is, I'm a fan."
4,"Classi, but...","This is a classic for anyone that can appreciate his very British humor. Dry at times, this sci-fi, is no ordinary sci-fi, it is what humor should be...Funny! It can make you roll on the ground with laughter! They don't make much better...I must point out though, the last update published in this volume doesn't live up to his individual stories...Sorry!"
5,The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide,"What can I say about this book that probably hasn't been said by other Hitchiker fans the world over. I absoultly loved these books, over and over again. Adoring every word of Adam's sardonic and witty humour. Truely one of the greatest books I've read. Though I am very envious of Adams' style and wish it was my own."
5,"the wittiest, funniest sci-fi novels ever written","Douglas Adams is a master of wittiness. The first 4 books are absolutely marvelous, but the last one is a bit dissappointing. If you are a fan of subtle British humor, obvious witticisms, or anything of that sort, you absoltely MUST read this series. It has become a world classic, for obvious reasons, and it is sad that Adams died so young.If you saw the movie before reading the books, as I did - don't be fooled. The storyline of the books is much different (other than the first few chapters), and I believe the radio series was completely different, as well. Everything about THAT is explained in the introduction."
4,Great gift,"I read the reviews before buying this for a friend's 42nd birthday (42!), and was a little uncertain what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised to find that the pages are of a reasonable weight considering the size. I'm sure a purist would rather have each individual book, but this is a nice collection for the bookshelf."
5,This is humor intelligently written.,"I love this book! Douglas Adams is great. He can find a way of describing something that is so far-fetched, you can't help but laugh. And in my stressful life, I need humor to keep me sane."
5,Well worth what I paid,"If you want the complete collection, buy this book. It's much better then any other's I have seen online, plus it probably costs less."
2,A Typo-Filled Disappointment,"The many obvious typos distract from the story. The odd phrasings, that I don't recall from reading the paperbacks as they were first published, make me suspect that there are many, more subtle typos in this Kindle edition."
5,An absolute classic.,"Really, there's not much more to it. A sci-fi must, a comedy must and a truly quotable, hilarious romp. JUST READ IT."
5,this is the greatist book i have ever read,omg this is a great book i love it.infact if it were a girl i would marry her.
5,Highly Convenient and Worth The Money,"I don't see any reason not to recommend this book. The Hithhiker's series is one of the best, most entertaining, and certainly funniest serieses out there. Whether you're into comedy, science fiction, or just plain wackiness in your reading this book is a must. All five books in the series are here in one volume, as is the fairly inconsequential but completist short story Young Zaphod Plays It Safe, and an amusing introduction from Adams. This is a very convenient volume because it has all of these things between the same two covers, and it is bargain-priced, certainly far cheaper than buying all the books separately, plus you get the bonus short story, the new intro, etc. Highly, highly recommended."
3,Deluxe?,"I bought this edition of the book because there are just some books you need to have nice copies of. I was disappointed. The covers are spongy, and not tightly wrapped like you would expect from any book with value to it. Not only that, but the paper is not of good quality- mass-market recycled paper at best. These are trivial things, I admit, but when you can get the same book that feels nicer for five dollars, it makes a lot of difference. Also, this is purely a comment on the physical aspect of the deluxe edition of the book- inside is the best comic sci fi you will ever read, bar none."
5,Great Sci-Fi,This compilation of books is great for every Science-Fiction fan. Greatly recommended If you like fantasy Science Fiction and British humor.
5,Excellent quality,Excellent printing and binding quality for the price. Looks like a treasured heirloom of classic literature. Most people who saw me reading this thought I was reading Shakespeare or a Bible until I told them what it was and gave them a closer look.
5,THE BEST,"If you do not care about reading a book for stimulating your mind, and/or being engrossed in complex human relationships, read this, and you'll laugh extremely hard; you'll laugh, on average, 5 times a chapter, of which there are usually 20-30 in each book. The sheer insanity and irreverence the Adams uses is built into the book ingeniously. All Books in the collection I reccomend, but ""So Long and Thanks for all the Fish"" was a bit off, not containing the feel of the previous books very much, though it is a worthwhile read. If you are amused by the phrase ""...almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea."" you'll probably like these stories."
5,OUTSTANDING!,"My daughter who is 13 read these book, told me they were wonderful and suggested I read them. They are the most hilarious series ever written!"
5,Just that good,"It's so good, I keep an extra copy around to lend to anyone I meet who has not read it. It's currently resting with a beautifully cynical english tutor my son has. I, personally, have read all the books three or four times in the past few years. Obsessed? No... 'Nuff said."
5,The Best Book I Have Ever Read!!!,"This would have to be the best book I have ever read. I originally had to read this as a summer reading book but I got so into it I went out and bought six other titles by Douglas Adams. This book is so ful of suspense, I could not put it down! I highly recomend this book to anybody."
2,Overrated,"Title pretty much sums it up. The book is obviously full of itself. It tries to be witty and humorous, but fails miserably. My advice-Read Ender's Game or Ender's Shadow (actually read both) instead, since Orson Scott Card actually knows how to write an interesting book."
4,amusing galaxy,"there are these 2 people: ford and arthur. both living on a planet (earth) to be destroyed. they got to get away from the planet. there is however, more to it. there's a depressed robot named marvin. the president, zaphod. an improbability machine. nasty creatures. designers. dolphins and rats. there will be a lot of things going on. the characters are very interesting. the dialogue funny. great, lovely, funny details. actually, writing a review is very strange. adams must be experienced. his ideas are really far-out, very fantastic, and great. rats conducting observations with humans, etc. i'm not into sci-fi, but i recognize some of the satire, although perhaps not all. but there is also ""common"" satire, weird ideas, amusing dialogue...."
4,"But it gets old by book five, so, be sure to pace yourself.","A whimsical, witty satire that remains in the realm of the rediculousness and sillyness throughout. There is nothing subtle about the satire either. The story begins as Aurther Dent's house is to be destroyed for a by-way, but that doesn't matter because the earth is to be destroyed to make room for an inter-steller by-way; right away, the stroy is rediculous. Clever inventions will keep the reader turning the pages just to see what strange thing will befall Aurther Dent next. The first book is a must-read."
5,Astonishing!,"This is the book that will never leave your hands. You'll be wanting to re-read it on any chance you've got! Douglas Adams's unique choice of words make it so good... Hey, who knows? Maybe someday this phrase might pass as a slang between hitchhikers-""Hey,you sass that hoopy (whatever your name is)There's a frood who really knows where his towel is"""
5,A staple for humor and sci-fi fans.,"I have just started to reread this series and it is just as funny and entertaining as the first time. It combines whacky sci-fi with memorable characters. I find myself making references to the book all of the time. My friends think I'm crazy, due to Adams bizarre humor, but the book simply tickles my funny bone, even when I'm only thinking about it. I just can't recommend it enough to sci-fi fans, or anyone just looking for a humorous adventure through one messed up universe. ""So long and thanks for all the fish."""
2,outcome,"the book came in good condition, but it is a horrible book to read. I read the first 60 pages and haven't touched it since. It's literally a window prop now. Don't buy the book, just get the movie."
1,Horrible is being generous,"I really cannot understand what all the fuss is about this book. It is a terrible book and I had to half drag myself through it because it is a purported classic. The plot is nothing to marvel at, the characters are dangling between the fantastic and the obscure and the writing is plebian. What a frustrating experience!"
1,zzz,"The more appropriate name for this book would be ""The Ultimate Idiot's Guide To The Madhouse"". No worthy idea underneath, just looks as if someone put on paper the crap which struck him into his head at the moment. Its 'Exquisite English Humor', indeed, is too hard to appreciate."
5,I Love This Book!,"Douglas Adams has a writing style that I've never come across before. His humor is so silly and so subtle (at times) that it's easy to miss the true genius of the book(s). I've seen Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and also listened to the radio productions; none of them touch the humor and randomness of Douglas Adams' story telling.I purchased this compilation of books in particular because of the cover and the fact that it's all the books in one; I love it! I thought the cover might look tacky irl but it definitely looks more appealing than tacky. It's a super good quality book and is a great gift for a Douglas Adams fan. I actually purchased the same book for my brother)For those just starting to read this, my advice is to make sure you read it when you're not tired, and when you're in the mood to laugh. If you read it when you're just not in the mood, you'll miss much of the story. This isn't a book to just breeze through. It's a book to read sentence by sentence."
2,E-Book Missing Punctuation,"My girlfriend got this book for her kindle. Great book, but reading it out-loud is difficult because of all the typos resulting in missing punctuation. For example, the period between two sentences is missing in one place, but the first word of the second sentence is still capitalized. The errors occur at a rate of about 10 per chapter. It's unforgivable; it's like no one read the e-book version before publishing it."
4,What a Hoopy Idea,"Douglas Adams is one funny guy. Having read each of the books individually what a terrific idea to compile them all in one volume.The humour is dry and zany, following the adventures of Arthur Dent and friends. The action starts with Arthur's house being destroyed, and the entire earth shortly thereafter. In reading this series you'll learn a lot about why towels are entirely useful, the significance of the number 42, and lots more.Mr. Adams always leaves me laughing and I'm very happy he managed to write these books before his passing. If you love sci-fi and a good laugh, you will LOVE this series. Conveniently compiled in this terrific edition."
5,A Classic,"If you like Monty Python but also enjoy watching Star Trek, you might really enjoy reading it like I did.Watch out, it is addictive!"
5,"""A wholly remarkable book.""",Douglas Adams. No need to say more! ....Amazon thinks I need to say more or the submit button won't lite up. There it goes.
5,Phenomenal,"This book had a big impact on me when I first read it. This is zany, witty, mad-cap science fiction at its best. It really is unparalleled!"
3,Product was superficially damaged on arrival,"Product was superficially damaged on arrival.Disappointing to a degree, but still a fantastic book, and so glad to finally have it on my shelf (bedside table, as i am currently reading it)"
5,Mostly Harmless,"Douglas Adams puts it all into perspective in this fun to read book. His dry British humor seems to sneak up on you. The main character is concerned about his house getting bull dozed down to make way for a bypass and little does he know that the whole world is about to suffer the same fate. He escapes with his old friend that turned out to be an alien from Betelgeuse.The president of the universe who had just stolen a new spaceship picks them up. The parallels Adams makes to the ""going ons"" with them and how things work in Government, and the like, make the book interesting.I just finished reading it for the third time in about 20 years."
2,It is really not that great !,"I just finished reading this book and my impression is not what I expected.This book was really short so there was no time for character development and/or long lasting engaging adventures.All of the ideas are great, but then quickly turned away and new ones come flying little too fast without fading in-or-out sensation.In general, I can see how this was a great book of its time (many years ago).Originally, this was a comedy broadcast on BBC Radio station in 1978.This would be a great broadcast that keeps you smiling while you drive at night desperately trying not to fall asleep.Sorry, but I missed the point of greatness expressed by others.At the same time it is so short and easy to read that everyone needs to have their own opinion (so just read it)!Thank you."
4,"Oh, the answer... I'm so depressed...","I saw the movie first and then read the book, and I wish I hadn't, because then I could have imagined the characters the way I wanted to... but that's true for all book based movies. Anyways, this collection is just delightful. I look forward to reading it every day. I was, however, slightly offended by the lack of dialogue and action that Trillian was given by the author. Hm. She was supposed to be an astrophysicist and yet she hardly does anything in the entire book. It's all just Zaphod and Arthur and Ford with personality. It may have been his intention to percieve Zaphod as larger than life... but did he have to make Trillian practially dead in order for that to happen? Is she just the token female? It seems that way when I read it. I loved the books though, I just noticed Trillian was missing from the excitement. She was my favorite in the movie."
2,I wanted to like it.,"I really wanted to like this book. It is a legendary blend of science fiction and comedy and I really enjoyed the movie based on it. Unfortunately, I really did not enjoy the book. It is very dull and the characters are unrelatable. The subtle references to Asimov's science fiction help to salvage the book, and Arthur's brief experience as a sandwich maker is the most interesting sub-plot. Overall, there is very little continuity and I recommend spending your time on something else."
2,Borrow the Book from the Library First!!!,"I thoroughly enjoy a good sci-fi series, whether it's Azimov's Foundation series, McCaffery's Dragonriders of Pern, or Herbert's Dune books. I'd heard of the Hitchhiker series for years and when I found it in omnibus form, I was delighted and picked it up forthwith.But for some strange reason, it didn't happen for me. Only because I'd spent the money did I manage to get thru the lot. But, with apologies to the Grateful Dead, what a long, strange, and gnarly slog it was. I suppose it's one of those things like Peter Sellers (YES!,) Pee Wee Herman (caaREEEPY,) or Barney (gagging sounds). You love it or not. There's no middle ground."
4,Science Fiction for Sci Fi Haters . . .,"I am NOT big into science fiction. It just isn't my cup of tea. And it isn't Arthur Dent's either . . . the poor man spends novels trying to GET a cup of tea! And that is the wonderful thing about the books in this series . . . they're not typical sci fi and they rather poke fun at the whole genre. I enjoyed these books and have enjoyed the first couple for ages. So, why not five stars? First thing, its a lot of Hitchiking to digest at once. An active content table of contents would have helped make it more convenient to read the series broken up. Also, if you read the material at the begining of the wrk, you'll realize that writing these wasn't really super fun for the author, which is why the last two books have the feel of being tossed out quickly, with little enthusiasm, and a lot of ""FINE, HERE!"" Still funny, though. Good read."
5,"Fantastic,","The first book of what is, by far, the best series I have ever read.Read this book, then read anything else Douglas Adams ever wrote."
3,A wierd but enchanting book,"This book took my mind futher than it had gone before. It is full of adventure and suspens. You might want to be careful about your children reading this book it is a little forword and doesn't hold back much. It makes you wonder if all of it is actually true. With all its far fetched nonsense about the vogon star ship , babble fish, and all. After you read it you may be a little daized so you might not want to read this book on the subway or standing up anywhere. Some parts my shock you senseless."
2,"Boring, boring, boring","Maybe i'm not ""nerdy"" enough, but this book is just not that interesting. It's been plenty long enough for me to have finished it, but i put it aside to read other more gripping novels."
2,HUH?,"some parts were funny, but mostly it was dry british humor with really stupid characters. If you like monty python you might like this. I hate monty python and only gave it two stars because I think one stars are reserved for the stuff that makes me violently ill. this only made me moderately ill"
5,FUNNY!,"I picked up this book not knowing what to expect and 10 pages in to it I still didn't know what the heck was going on but I was rolling on the floor because I was laughing so hard. You do finaly understand this novel, though there isn't much to understand, and it just makes you laugh. My favorite character was the manic depressive robot but all the characters are unique and witty. Adams is a genuis. Don't Panic!"
5,A must read,"Short and simple, if you have not read Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, read it. If you have, read it again. So clever and fun, and a quick read. I love Douglas Adams for giving us this series."
4,"Nice version, just not really what it said it would be","Very good condition and speedy delivery. Item was promesed to be leather however, and it turned out to be fake leather"
3,"Starts Strong, but Dwindles","I really enjoyed 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' and 'The Restaurant at the End of the Universe' and to a lesser extent 'Life, the Universe and Everything' -- the other two books seemed a bit tacked on and boring. I had never read any of these books prior to my husband purchasing this for me as a gift so I didn't know what to expect. I read thru the first three books very quickly and enjoyed the humor....even if there is a bit of filler material and tons of side stories. The last two books (especially Mostly Harmless) were not funny (to me) in any way, it seemed that the humor that filled the first three books was lost on the last two. I trudged thru the last two books and it is my opinion that if you are interested in this series and know nothing about it this book is a good buy b/c you get all 5 books plus the short story, just don't expect all the stories to be equally great or funny."
4,If only Adams had quit while he was ahead.,"The five books in this collection are often called the ""increasingly misnamed"" Hitchhikers Guide trilogy because for several years there were just the first three books and I really wish things had stayed that way. It isn't even that the 4th and 5th books are bad really it's just that they aren't in the same league as the first three.Books 1 2 and 3 are a fast paced joyride of silliness with thought provoking ideas cleverly hidden in plain sight. The author plays with the English language like a man wining a game of ping pong with a pair of nun chucks. You want to tell him he's doing it wrong but can't put your finger on why. Then you shrug and watch the spectacle.Book 4 slows the pace to a crawl and only the last chapter is really all that interesting. Book 5 is just like the first 3 but somehow the magic is gone and it all falls flat.I highly recommend buying this book and then forgetting that the last 40% exists."
5,Wonderful series,"Review of first book in the series:Overall: Spectacular fun. A plot that makes up for its lack of believability / lack of development with the sheer volume of its ideas and its droll British humor. We follow along with the persistently boggled Arthur Dent and along the way find out how to mix a Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster, the answer to the question of life, the universe, and everything, and the true purpose of both little white mice and the Earth. What more can you ask for?As a cult classic, it falls firmly into the ""you love it or you hate it"" category. This first book in the series presents an easy way to spend a few hours with a quick paperback and determine which category you fall into. If you love it, there's 4 more books and a few other Adams works to explore; if you fall into the ""hate it"" category you've only lost a few hours (though apparently at some previous point in time you lost your soul, but oh well)."
4,"Witty satire...makes you laugh,cry,...grab a towel!!!","Hitchhiker fans can breath a sigh of relief. This outstandingfive-volume trilogy is now available in one easy to carry volume!Come join the adventures of our mishap-laden hero Arthur Dentas his day starts from bad, his house is set to be demolished...and the noticejust arrived today; to worse, his planet is just about to be demolished...Ford Prefect,Zaphod Beeblebrox,and sexy brainiac Trillian arehis companions on this jaunt from the restaurant at the end of the universe,to the legendary planet of Magrathea, and beyond. This work isfull of British humor, twisted logic, and numerous references to Vogons,towels,no tea, and the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy...a wonderfully useless piece of workthat no hitchhiker would dare leave home without."
5,"Totally unique, clever, and altogether hoopy.","This series should be required reading for allsentient creatures.""No sir, your monkey is right!"""
5,"Mix of Scott Adams, Shakespeare, and something VERY wierd.","All of the books in this ""trilogy"" were incredibly funny, but also very deep. Reading this book, there were times when I almost literaly rolled on the floor laughing, and other times when something I'd read would be so heavy that I'd think about it for days.I didn't read the books in order, (which only added to the wonderful confusion of the story line, and I would actually recommend doing the same) and I began my experience traveling the universe with these lines that I think summarise the mood and the story for the entire set of books.""There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizzarre and inexplicable.There is another which states that this has already happened."""
5,Fascinating--immensly deep and refreshingly light,"The classic comment on this book is ""Monty Python in Space"".This is just about on the mark. It can be silly or profound,depending on your mood at the time. I've never known anybodywho didn't like it. Not recommended for those whohate having a good time. Otherwise, pick it up!"
1,"Wow, this is way too tight.","I am a big guy with a large upper body. By no means a body builder, I am roundish. I got this rash guard to use on a trip to Kauai and have to say that I did not even bring it! Instead I used a Speedo rash guard that I bought on sale at Big 5 (sales are great near end of summer for swimwear). This did not fit right, from the arms to the sides. it seems they did not scale up everything but keep the same and width arms for the small to xxl swim shirts. This is common with cut and sew, to reuse the same patterns to cut costs. But if Im xxl around the body, dont you think my arms are xxl too?!? The neck, arms (especially underarms) were too tight to be comfortable. It was a struggle just getting it on and off. I know a rash guard should be snug, but this was unwearable."
1,Very disappointing,I've used Quicken for over 5 years. Until this version I've been a big fan. This version has many unacceptable bugs. It's added up the wrong total on my credit card accounts. It leaks system resources until it crashes. It fails to update the status on several of the windows until you restart it. The bill minder sometimes doesn't flag an uncoming bill. Sometimes it will stop updating the screen and will not minimize. I seem to spend almost as much time handling techinal problems as I do my finances. This version seems to be thrown together so Intuit could make a quick buck.
1,No Support,"I have recently upgraded to this newest version of Quicken- only because I thought it was time to ""modernize."" I am an experienced Quicken user and have always enjoyed the program.But, upon upgrading I found a problem whithin one of the investment options. When this occurs, you call for help. Not with Quicken, however. Check out Intuits web page. They list FAQ's and have no provision for specific Q&A's. Call their phone number (not toll free) and you are put into a labrynth which get's you no where.They do have a bug feed back system, but no promises of fixes and they state that their policy is not to respond to you.You are putting your financial accounting in their hands, but they lack the most important ingredient to customer satisfaction- simple service. ( I did see a 900 number- but no thanks.)At this writing, I am consdiering reloading my old version.Help Intuit get the message. Don't buy or upgrade."
2,Quicken 2001 has advertisements that cannot be turned off.,"Quicken 2001 Deluxe's on-line help states: ""You can turn off advertisements that appear in the Online Financial Services Center. Advertisements in other areas of Quicken cannot be turned off."" Hmmm... Let me get this straight - Intuit thinks I'll use their financial services after learning that they won't let me control whether of not advertisements appear on my desktop using their software for which I paid a fair price.Linux users might find GnuCash a functional alternative.They'll remain in control. GnuCash is literally free and is also free of advertising."
1,Stick with Quicken 2000,"Recently ""upgraded"" from Q2000 to Q2001 (R2). Big mistake. Much slower and loaded with bugs and shortcomings. I'll probably go back to Q2000, even with all the pain of re-entering data.Stick with Q2000 until Intuit fixes Q2001."
1,Support is a joke.,"The only way you can get live telephone tech support is to pay by the minute.The best way to let Intuit know that this is not a good policy is to skip the current, relatively insignificant upgrade."
2,How Not to Design a User Interface,"In the midst of the Internet bubble it was all the rage for companies to design user interfaces that looked like web browsers. Unfortunately, Intuit fell into that trap, with the result that Quicken 2001 is clunkier and harder to use than any previous version of Quicken I've owned. I stuck with it rather than find another bookkeeping package, so I guess it's not completely unusable, but if you haven't made a decision yet I'd suggest you keep looking."
3,Quicken 20001 Deluxe for Linux,"I have been an Quicken customer for a long time, but having recently switched my operating system to RedHat Linux, I have decided to withhold my support for new Intuit products until they port them to Linux. Intuit has refused in the past to do so and they underestimate the demand for a Linux version. I hope everyone who feels the same way will also join me and vote with their dollars and not purchase any more Intuit products until they port them to Linux. thank you."
3,Mutual fund subtotal shares,"This is for the owners of this version of Quicken. Does the mutual fund share subtotals on the right hand column gives you 2 decimal digits or three. I like Quicken. But every version since version 5 I've written to Quicken to ask for a display of 3 decimal digits for the mutual fund shares subtotal on every row. I've yet to see it being implemented. My mutual fund statement gives me share total to the 3rd decimal digits. I would like to see them in my Quicken register. How difficult is it to implement this feature? I know that internally it stored more than the 2 digits displayed, but I want to see the 3 decimal digits on the register."
2,Do Not Buy This Product Unless...,Do Not Buy This Product unless you are prepared to spend even more money through Intuit just to get it to work. I have spent over 1/2 a month and countless hours on the phone between my bank and Intuit trying to get Quicken to accept my bank information. My bank tells me it is a software problem. Every time I call Intuit they expect me to pay $1.95/minute to fix it. It seems they are unwilling to support thier own product. I am sending this back today.
2,Quicken 2001>>>,"I have used Quicken since the DOS days and have upgraded religiously over the years. I have had good experiences with earlier versions. My financial needs then were relatively simple and Quicken served me well. Times have changed.The observant longtime Quicken user will notice that Intuit has grown as well. Gone are the days of ""passionate engineering"" and welcome arrogant marketing. Rather that list my Quicken 2001R3 woes and shortcomings (I have been bug reporting and enhancement mentioning for quite some time) I wanted to confess that I actually downloaded... shall I mention it... MicroSoft Money. Yes I did. I even converted my 9+ years of Quicken data. Sorry Mr. Intuit.If MSM does not work out, I'll take my wife's advice and go back to paper and pencil."
2,Bloatuit (Stick with your old version),Intuit has forgotten what made them great.I've been using Quicken for many years and this update is the worst by far. Customer support is terrible. On-line updates of stock prices crash my otherwise very stable system every time. Reconciling your checkbook is now more difficult due to the sort view which doesn't match your checking statement. Entering data into your portfolio is harder.Intuit seems to think it is all about feature bloat and looks instead of about simple intuitive interfaces. Maybe they should change their name to bloatuit.
1,"It wasn't broke but they ""fixed"" it anyway!","I've been a Quicken user since 1990. My favorite feature was ""Scheduled Transactions."" I let Quicken automatically post recurring bills and income to my checking account 90 days in advance. This gives me a quick view of my cash flow for the next 3 months. (Scheduled Trans allowed posting up to 999 days in advance).Quicken 2001 changed the Scheduled Trans to a 30-day limit. Oddly enough, when you convert from a previous version of Quicken, 2001 will accept and post Scheduled Transactions with advance days greater than 30. But if you attempt to change ANYTHING on the scheduled transaction, an error message appears and prohibits you from saving your change until you ""correct"" the number of days.I'm sticking with my old version until Intuit lets me do it my way."
2,"Great when it works, lousy support","I have never been able to get decent support for problems with Quicken, and they do crop up too often for something I have to rely on. Intuit has the worst support policy of any company I deal with, enough to make me seriously consider going through the pain of switching to Microsoft Money (and considering my opinon of Microsoft, that's saying a lot!). Latest example: I bought a new machine, followed the directions for backing up my files on the old machine and restoring them on the new machine. This lost all my preferences, but that was the minor nuisance. THE DEVESTATING PROBLEM IS THAT I CANNOT GO ONLINE TO ANY OF MY BANKING, BROKERAGE, OR CREDIT CARD COMPANIES NOW. Not a hint of a clue anywhere in the documentation, help, or website that Intuit ever considered that customers using the online features might upgrade their hardware. Rather than go through telephone hell and then pay $... a minute to discuss it with them, I'm out of here!"
5,"""As it had done every day for a hundred years, the rising...","sun slipped through a tiny opening in the side of the mountain and illuminated the face of a dead man."" This tome provides a ficticious insight into the life of Leonardo da Vinci in contemporary American society. A family is touched by the genius and humility of this Renaissance man for a summer. They learn to live, love, and judge in entirely new ways. A must read for young adults. A touching altruistic novel indeed."
2,Dissapointed,"I've tried to listen to this disk several times, really I've tried! But I just don't like it! Borrow someone's before you buy it."
2,On the cheap,"There's a prophetic line at the start of the second track, ""I Can't Remember"": ""I'm not gonna lie to you, something is missing."" Despite the fact that it boasts the work of three moderately successful solo artists, including Pete Droge, Shawn Mullins, and Matthew Sweet (whose other work I really enjoy--check out In Reverse), The Thorns comes up short. Instead of any driving rhythms or compelling lyrics, the thirteen songs here consist mostly of three-part harmony and lyrics that sound like they were sanitized during the process of three songwriters tweaking them. The results are bland and inoffensive, certainly not as good as fans had every right to expect from these three. There's a reason people are selling used copies on the cheap."
1,Pop - Fluff - Boredom,"Well.....it looked good on paper. These 3 guys have made some more than competent melodic pop/rock in their solo modes. Unfortunately, The Thorns is a waste of those talents. Featherweight songwriting, laughably banal lyrics, and character-less, soulless harmony vocals. Don't be fooled by the CS&N comparisons. (Buy their remastered 1st album if you need a reminder). Sorry guys, but this is disappointing."
5,Memorable Melodies for Sunny Days or Melancholy Ones,I went to see the Thorns on the 4th of July with the Jayhawks and was impressed. I bought the CD the next day and did'nt like it at the first 4 or 5 listens. Over the course of the last few weeks it has continued to grow on me to the point where I have to listen to it at least once a day.The talent of these guys is obvious. Brilliantly constructed and arranged songs and it doesn't hurt to have Brendan O'Brien behind the controls.I'm faintly acquainted with their solo work but it's nice to see 3 talented musicians leave their egos at the door and combine their talents to produce something totally different than their solo work. It's got to make the solo gig better and I will look further into each of their solo work.
3,Nice Easy Listening,"Nice, pleasant summer listening. My main comment is that everyone seems to be saying this is a CSN throwback or tribute but I hear so many other 70's influences. Obviously there is a stong Beach Boys, Brian Wilson presence. But I also hear America and Seals and Crofts. They probably don't want to hear this because maybe what they ended up with in the end is a great America tribute CD!"
3,"Vaguely Pleasant, But Uninspiring","I bought this cd on the strength of the positive reviews that I read and heard, especially with reference to the vocal harmonies within the songs. I really wanted to like the music, but after a few listens, I have to say that I'm disappointed. I agree with the other reviewers who mentioned that The Thorns' music sounds mainly like warmed-over, mid-seventies-era Crosby, Stills & Nash. While this album has its pleasant moments(hence the three, rather than two, stars), notably ""Blue"" and ""Such A Shame"", the music mostly seems a bit stale and overly derivative to me."
4,A blissful return to the 70s,"I'm familiar with, if not a huge fan of, the three gentlemen who make up The Thorns, so on a lark I picked up the CD. I was immediately impressed with what I heard (though the first track is probably the clunkiest of the bunch). Tight harmonies, engaging melodies and crisp production work together to create a thoroughly enjoyable album.The comparisons to CSN&Y are inevitable and there are certainly moments where Droge, Sweet and Mullins sound almost exactly like their late-60s counterparts, but there is something compelling about this album that transcends mere tribute. Tom Petty's recent work comes to mind. Both Petty and The Thorns draw on the past but don't live in it. This is one I'll listen to again and again - which is probably the highest praise I can give."
4,CSN wannabes? Not a bad group to emulate!,"So what if these guys sound a bit like CSN. If you like acoustic harmonies, I would recommend this album."
4,how can anyone NOT compare them to CS&N ???,"i am 54. i grew up on great rock and roll. these guys have wonderful harmony. it IS very similar to crosby, stills and nash on a few tracks. america, yeah, i can see that. jayhawks, definitely---one of my favorite current groups.but let's give them credit for bringing back some really thoughtful lyrics and beautiful melodies, and maybe look forward to where they go from here?i love this CD, and love their harmony----yes, it recalls a better time for me----but is that a BAD thing? i got a little sleepy on a couple of tracks, but all in all, this is a good piece of work.after all, it was MY generation that brought you the beatles, the stones, the moody blues, crosby, stills and nash, the who, america, seals and crofts, and all the rest.i KNOW what good music is. and THIS is good music."
2,"Sorry, I don't get it.","You heard about The Thorns and their CSN sound revival. You used to be a huge CSN fan and you have always respected Matthew Sweet's work. Then you hear Dragonfly on a public radio station and immediately run out and buy the disk. Then you discover, on a single listen, that the rest of the disk is a collection of thin, watery material with simple hooks.I expected some great guitar work and there is none on this collection. The cover of the Jayhawks' Blue is laughable in its lack of a new perspective and inability to match the energy of the original. Yes, the harmonies on this CD are solid and reasonably enjoyable. In the end, though, the problem is that most of the songwriting is utterly forgettable. This disk reminds me of later CSN music, when they no longer had their edge. I recommend listening to it attentively once before you buy it."
3,"Like CSN, but could have used some Y","I know I'm far from the first to make the comparison, but when you break into soaring harmonies and acoustic guitar dominated melodies, you start to think of CSN. The problem here is there is no edge at all. Where are the Neil Young influences? The songs are pleasent, easy to listen to, and almost instantly forgettable. Other than ""Thorns,"" I can't call one song to mind. I really wanted to like this more, but this is a case of the parts being greater than the whole."
4,"Good album, if you're in the mood for it","This album is VERY much like a Crosby, Stills, and Nash album. So much so that I am giving my copy to my mom, I think she would like it. I liked it too, although it's more of a Sunday-morning-with-the-paper disc than anything I would prefer to listen to at work. It's very mellow. But the harmonies are beautiful. There's nothing in the least bad or offensive about this album, but there's not a lot that's passion-inspiring either. Good music for a rainy day in front of the fire, but other than that - not much there."
4,Like a new Matthew Sweet album...but different,"When I listen to this CD I hear very much Matthew Sweet's take on the supergroups like CSN&Y. I am not a huge fan of Mullins or Droge so my listening is certainly biased. Where Sweet's In Reverse was sort of a wall of sound departure from his alternative rocking music, The Thorns is the aforementioned CSN&Y vector for his career (along with Mullins and Droge).So basically it sounds like a Matthew Sweet album to me, but is it any good? The answer is yes. The songs are generally listenable and amiable. Perhaps there is no song on the cd that really jumps out, but that is not really all that important for the whole value of a cd.The lean is to Matthew Sweet being the stronger of the three, but if you are a fan of any of them and are looking for something different than a bunch of 20-somthing ill dressed slackers mad at their dad's, then The Thorns self-titled CD is a refrshing break."
4,It would be hard not to like it,"As a huge Shawn Mullins fan who thinks anything he puts out is more than great, I heard about the Thorns and bought it.I liked it immediately, it did remind me of C/S/N and America, but the Thorns have their own flavor, and bravo to them for bringing back this sound, I'm really happy with the CD and look forward to more music they put out. There is a couple songs that were ok and that was why I only gave 4 stars. But it's a great addition to your music collection for a fresh take on a collaboration of 3 guys makin' a great sound."
3,Sooo close...,"I'm a huge Matthew Sweet fan, and I was thrilled to hear about The Thorns and rushed out to pick it up. On the plus side the vocal harmonies are absolutely incredible, and there are some clever hooks in the choruses. However, there seems to be some problems with verse melodies in addition to some bizarre production decisions regarding secondary instruments and such. There are parts that remind me a LOT of Crosby, Still and Nash... and those are the bits I like best. Unfortunately, there are also bits that remind me of the Traveling Wilburys, and those I do not like at all.I hope The Thorns will try again with an album made up of nothing but acoustic guitars and harmonies. I feel they'd be better if they left their string arrangements and electric instruments at home. Still, this album is worth having if for nothing else but the harmonies. Not a bad effort, but not as good as is should've been"
2,Heard it all before,Although the album is well produced and recorded it has all been done before in the 70's. Nothing original here. I gave it 2 stars for the production not content. Everyone is comparing them to CSN&Y. I think they sound exactly like Seals & Croft. Not even as good for that matter. Matthew Sweet is capable of much more as well as Shawn Mullins. Why bother cloning classic music. If you want to revive it add some freshness to it. This cd will bore and tire people out after a few listens. It's already grating on my nerves. I think I will pull out my Deja Vu album from the cobwebs and give it a listen. This will confirm that if it ain't broke don't fix it !
2,Overrated Book,"If you like to carve awesome pumpkin patterns for Halloween (or Thanksgiving or Christmas, for that matter), thisis not the book for you. It has just a few patterns inside and they are garden variety at best. The rest of the bookis just trivial Halloween fluff. There are more interesting patterns on the yearly Pumpkin Masters kits at a lower price."
4,For history buffs.,"This is really one for the history buffs. In 1721 in the reign of George 1, the infamous South Sea Bubble scandal rocked England and some of Europe, proving that greed and corruption, in the form of speculative share market swindling, is not a new thing. A penniless map maker is drawn into a web of intrigue by reason of having his debts paid out and being forced to travel to Holland as the unwitting dupe of one of the main players in the South Sea Bubble scandal. He is falsely accused of murder and is forced to search for and to produce to his English masters, a green book, listing the names of VERY prominent people, from the King down to cabinet ministers, who were paid enormous bribes to take part in the hoax which robbed thousands of small investors, but made the rich men richer (sound familiar?) This book was very reminiscent of the works of Dennis Wheatley who wrote books involving the aristocracy, political intrigues, murder and travel through Europe."
5,One of many books read of R. Goddard,"The condition of the book is very good, letters the right size and content thrilling as always. Excellent writing skills."
2,The never ending race,"this book is a never ending race after a ""Green Book"" that can reveal some of the most darken secrets of the South Sea Company...i was a bit dissaponting from reading it and was expecting another of Goddard's master pieces, but unfortunatly this book was very tiring and exhausting."
5,Everything you want from Samurai Jack,The seasons were everything that I was hoping for. I don't think that the DVD have left my players since they came in the mail. Good stuff.... I can't wait for the rest of them to come out.
1,"Dated ""shock""",I've just returned from a month long stay in Syria where I traveled throughout the country. During my travels I met many interesting people young and old and from every political persuasion. All were extremely friendly to me as an American and stated that they viewed the American government (read Bush) differently from the American people. I was very disappointed in how out of date the Cultural Shock book was in almost all areas. The country is no where near as conservative as you would be led to believe by this text. On many occasions I couldn't believe that he was writing about the same country as I visited. I read the book before I went and then reread it upon return. I wouldn't recommend this book because it is so very dated. An added point: I have traveled extensively in the middle east and am very familiar with the history and cultures. of many of the countries. This book sorely needs updating!!!
1,very oriented and a little outdated,"Very North American oriented book, some interesting and accurate economic informations (to open your company in Syria for example). Some funny quiz about social situations, but globally outdated, new laws since two years are not included, prices have changed, as well as services, especially in the Old City.Unless it's soon uptaded, and you come from Canada or the States; I would not really recommend it."
2,"Obsolete, except if you're a fanatic collector","Great playlist, trashed by an awful sound-mix. What was the guy doing in charge of the mix? Not paying attention, that's for sure. Mostly same show (solo's & breaks) as the Live by Request DVD, it's getting boring now. There's actually one good reason to buy this DVD. Sonny.E is fantastic on drums. Overall very disappointing. If only they had footage of the Live in Rio concerts. I keep hoping. For now stick with the 1981 Oakland DVD, or better just play the CD's."
4,Godd DVD for EWF Fans,"This DVD makes you realize how different EWF was in the late 90s versus the mid/late '80s. I miss the pyrotechnics, magic & Maurice (not in that order), but then again that's not why I bought this item or actually why I attended 15 of their concerts in 25 years. It's putting it in the player and realizing what good musicians, good lyricists with good vocals with a singular goal can do on a stage. It's a groove thing that only R&B fans can truly appreciate or understand. I know this may sound a little out-of-whack , but if someone ever captures the current Charlie Wilson tour on DVD, you kinda get the sense of what the glory days were back then. Charlie Wilson has the EWF spirit behind his modern-day fascade needed to make some bucks for him & his family. The ""EWF 3"" is what we have now and I'm glad to see them whenever/wherever they perform."
1,I can only imagine,"I purchased this DVD with great anticipation. I eagerly inserted it into my player and pressed play. Nothing, I got nothing. I send it back and requested a replacement. I eagerly inserted it into my player and pressed play. Again, nothing, I got nothing. Alas, I sent it back for a refund. BTW, the player was new so it wasn't the player. I can only imagine how good it was."
5,EARTH WIND AND FIRE AT THEIR BEST,"This dvd really showcase Garry Bias Saxs talent. EW&F; plays manysongs right after another which I enjoyed. The dvd also showcaseSonny Emory drums talent to include Sheldon Reynolds Guitar playing. Many of the songs are change at some point which makesthe song sound interesting and fun. I think this dvd is a must buy for all EW&F; fan and for those who want to see the most talented musicains on the face of the earth and universe. Finally Verdine White bass licks are very noticable in this dvd,so go out and get this dvd today."
5,Flat Fold Colander,I love the fact that I can fold the colander up flat!! I bought several of them for my daughters and they all love them!!
4,It is AS SEEN ON TV -,"If it's on TV, it must be great, right? Well, this folding collander didn't disappoint. It's not as easy to make it fold out to poor as reported, but it does the trick. The best thing about it is that it folds flat for storage. I have a VERY small kitchen, so I needed to save space in any way I could. This collander certainly helped with that. I've also had it for a really long time now, and it's still working great."
3,OK but...,"My first use of this item was with angel hair pasta. Um, bad idea. There were many strands of pasta leaking through the crevices on the bottom on both sides. My next use was rinsing lettuce. That worked better, but I'm not thrilled how unwieldy this thing is and how flimsy. Probably will put in in my box of items to be donated."
2,"Not as seen on TV, missing clasp","This looks like the same as the original but there is one small, but in my opinion important discrepancy, the colander does not ""snap"" closed. The original one does. When you tuck it away into your cabinate it will spring open unless other items in your cupboard prevent it from doing so.Comparing the original one with this one, side by side, you can see that the original has clasps close to the handle, this one does not.I would have given this product one star if it was not for the fact I could not find the orignal one for sale anywhere, so i am thankful at least, that this one exists."
2,flimsy,"The first thing I noticed was that the hinge design was weak. Sure enough, the weak hinge broke after only 8 uses.The inventor had a good idea, but the manufacturing design is poor."
1,I got taken to the bank,"I got taken to the bank on this one. First they say 83 joiners, it was only 24, second, while the initial cost as very low, the shipping and handling was absolutly crazy. It think it was over 10 bucks. This is not Amazon's fault as it was not a prime product and I had to go a different store via Amazon to get them. I do not have a good hobby shop in my immediate area (that I know of) so sometimes I am held over the barrel for essential parts such as this. So 24 plastic rail joiners cost me like 13 bucks. But as for the product there is not much that can go wrong if you know what I mean."
4,An interesting tool for students,"This book can be compared to other Principles of Surgery. It has good B&W illustrations and is easy reading. Some subjects are not so detailed as I was looking for, but it can be an useful guide for medical students and general surgery residents."
5,Gift to grandson,My grandson was extremely excited to get this game. He is 8 and loves Gameboy Advance.
1,No Ignition Keys--,If you do not receive ignition keys you can't use the machine!!Seller did not follow up with ignition keys!Item is rated one star because I was not able to start it without keys!Thankfully there was not enough snow that is was needed!
3,snow blower,great for small jobs and a very good price for the machine you get if you have a lot of snow then this little buddy will do a great job if its not over 2 feet deep still a great snow blower
1,Return.,"Oh, well I won't give anyone recommand to get this machine at all. After I using it for 2 time. I need to bring it back for refund. The reason gasline leaking. The engine stop after 5 mins run. I still have 11 inches tall snow need to be throw. Next time I will look for a better one."
4,This thing is saving my back and shoulders!,"I received this machine last week and it was very easy to put together and get started. In searching for a snowthrower, I wanted one that was not too big and heavy, for a woman to operate. This was just what I needed. So far, I've thrown about 7-8 inches of snow in two sessions and it works great."
2,"It wiggles, it tips, and it stands too high","After purchasing a laptop table more than a year ago for myself, I purchased this one for my wife. It is not as stable as the others we have seen and used, and at the lowest setting it is 6 inches above my waist (I am over 6'3""). My wife is 5'8"" and can only use this stand when sitting on our (elevated) bed. If she jacks an office chair high enough to type on this stand, her feet can barely reach the floor. If they simply drilled the pin holes all the way to the bottom of the vertical cylinder this tray could be used by people as short as 5'10"". A shorter cylinder would be even better."
4,"Great price, function, pretty close","I was wondering why this unit was so inexpensive. It is made of compress particle board and has a vinyl laminate over. It was very easy to construct and works well for my purposes. My only gripe with this one is that the longer side of the table for placement of a laptop makes the whole thing kind of unbalanced for heavier hands. I had to kind of fudge with the height and rotation of the table for it to be more balanced for my use. But yeah, this is a great price for a simple table to roll a laptop around when the desktop system leaves no room on the table for stuff."
3,Lap top table,I acquired this table to aid me in reading hard cover books. The height and swing radius of the book support arm were critical to my needs. I did not install the small support arm because the arm chair has a side table next to it. The table is tucked into the arm chair and I just swing the book support arm aside to get up and vacate the chair. The table is perfect for my needs.
4,Very Good!,Even my wife enjoyed watching this DVD and learned a thing or two. Very informative and lots of archive footage. Good narration by Adam West. It's well worth your time to view.
3,"Good product, but limited in context.",This dictionary was limited in content. I'm sure due to being large print; however it was not exceptabel for what I use thedictionary for. I use it in connection with crossword puzzles and many of the words I needed to look up were not in thisbook. I returned it for a refund.
4,Webster Dictionary Rules!,This dictiionary exceeded expectations. The print is large enough for all. A very nice layout and my go to for most of my report writing. Thanks Webster!!
4,shipping and book in good condition,"`The shipping was fast and the book was in good condition! I really didn't take too much time with it, but the dictionary appeared to be a good dictionary for when needed!"
4,Good for Students; Great for Elderly/Visual Impaired!,"I bought this dictionary for my son to keep in his desk at school. Even though he does not need glasses, I bought the large print edition so that he would not have to strain at all. We purchased Webster's Student Dictionary and this portable one, and the portable one is actually thicker than the student edition. It is a bit narrower and it has a soft cover (the other has a hard cover). Between the two, I would definitely choose the student edition because it has synonyms, however, this is a really good dictionary. I took off one star because it is not portable...unless you carry your bookcase on your back :-). Certainly a great choice for anyone who does not want to strain his or her eys when using."
2,Lots of words left out.,"I got this dictionary because I read in bed at night and use a booklight. If I run upon a word I don't know, I would like to have a dictionary that's easy to see quickly without straining my eyes. (I'm 45) The print in this dictionary is great, but lots of words are left out, rendering it almost useless. Why not leave out the easy words if something has to go? Bottom line -- I'm back to straining my eyes with a regular dictionary."
2,"Large print, but limited...",The idea behind this book is excellent. The large print in this book is excellent. But they left out way too many needed words when they had to choose what to include and what to leave out. Don't get rid of your old dictionary!
2,Easy To See Words,The print is definately large but the definitions are very vague. I found myself looking up definitions to the definition.
3,"Good printing, etc. but words are not adequate","It doesn't have enough words to meet my needs, but I knew that when I bought it. Next time I will spend more money and get a larger vocabulary!"
2,Late and item was returned for refund,"The dictionary was ordered 12/16/11 (free shipping), and was to be included with other items that were received around the 22nd. It was not included with the shipment so it did not arrive for Christmas giving. After following up with Amazon, the item was received within a week. This is not the basis for the 2-star rating.The large-print edition of the dictionary contained too few words that are not commonly known and the brief definitions of the words were insufficient as to elaboration. The dictionary was of little use to us and I have returned the item for refund."
5,The Tyrant has been shreded!,"Unlike all the other reviews, well i have something in common i think Goku is the man but I also like Frieza. This video shows the Tyrant Frieza get cut in half but don't be sad over Frieza's death, he will be back!"
1,Don't bother,"DBZ, GAG! don't waste your money on anything with the title Dragon Ball Z. Go spend your money on a decent series like Trigun or Cowboy Bebop. I only gave it one star because it didn't have a zero stars option."
4,The Broken Demon,"In this 4-episode tape, the endgame between Frieza and SSJ Goku ends with a BANG! In ""The Last Wish"", both Dende and Frieza race toward the giant Porunga, each with their own wish in mind. In ""Duel on a Vanishing Planet"", with everyone on Namek save Frieza and Goku safely returned to Earth, the two superpowers go all-out. In ""Pathos of Frieza"", it appears that Frieza has been defeated by Goku...or has he? And, finally, in ""Frieza Defeated! "", the mighty tyrant is (AT LAST) destroyed by his own attack. But can Goku get off the planet before the explosion?"
5,What an end,"As a conclusion to the long suspensful Frieza saga it is great. This four episode set is four of the greatest episodes of Dragonball Z. Goku the LEGENDARY SUPER SAIYAN destorying the long living, unforgivable, great evil of Frieza. Frieza is would also be called one of the greats among evil. Tyrants to be exact. It is a great battle. So suspensful and absolutely fabulous. If I could I would give it 10 stars. Just to prove that Dragonball Z rocks."
5,This show is excellent,"Goku has become so powerful but he is still the best good guy around, offering Freiza another chance to turn from his evil ways. Finally, Freiza is getting what he deserves. GO GOKU!"
3,Unreasonable assumption,Good buy if you need A LEFT SIDE stop and tail light for your trailer. During the ordering process you are not asked to specify if you want a right or a left light. I ordered two for my trailer on the mistaken assumption I'd get a RIGHT and a LEFT light. Wrong assumption; I received TWO LEFT lights.
1,Informative but not to be admired,"This book was groundbreaking in only one respect: it provides an explanation to racialist movements during that time. It is not a work to be respected, admired or emulated. Rather, it should be used as a tool to understand what has happened in the past; how those past ideals and subsequent events are affecting us now; and how it may affect us in the future. We should be working to surpass those antiquated (and, frankly, quite dangerous) notions of race and racial superiority. It makes me ill to think that there are people who take enough stock in this work to believe it as to be true."
3,Skeptical,Does anyone else think that the previous reviewer sounds like he just might be a Microsoft marketing guy?
3,"Okay, but not great","These compressed rawhide sticks weren't as thick as those we pick up at the local pet store, but they were quite a bit cheaper. Our Golden Retriever and Yellow Lab chewed these up pretty quick, and often tore off very large pieces, that they then would swallow. Overall these aren't bad, but for our dogs I'd like to find something a little thicker."
3,Kinda Good,"I just purchased 2 gloves, one for each hand. They were not exactly the same size, one was slightly harder to get my hand into than the other. I am still using them and think that I may start seeing improvement in the comfortability of my hands, but it remains up in the air. The looser feeling of the gloves does feel really good and make it easier to type. I would have also preferred that they use some softer or gelly like substance in the palms of the gloves instead of the bean bag type stuff they currently are using. Overall, if your hands hurt before, during, or after typing, these are definately something that you should at least try out for yourself."
1,avoid wearing anything like it during the day,"If you wear this glove and still use your hand, you are not helping Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) or Repetitive strain injuries. You will not be preventing yourself from furthur injury nor will you be treating your injury. If you wear this glove during the day and have CTS or repetitive strain injury you will be making your condition worse.For a brief period of time, my doctor told me to wear one when I was sufferning from CTS. Later, I discovered that the glove was actually making my condition worse. This glove still allows one to use the hand in grasping and squeezing yet restricts one from using the muscles to keep the wrist from drooping. CTS and other repetitive strain injuries of the wrist are caused by a muscle imbalance in the wrist and fingers. Hence when a person wears a glove like this they are increasing the muscle imbalance and worsening their condition. Wear this glove at night when you are asleep, but NEVER use it during the day."
2,Look for something else,"While the glove does support and keep your wrists from bending to much while granting flexibility there are some issues that need to be worked out.I found that the ergo beads do not make your wrist more comfortable. Why? Because the beads are not located at the wrist section of the glove. When the glove is worn the bead pouch mostly fills the palm area leaving no beads at the wrist. This makes trying to use a PC mouse a pain and uncomfortable, you cannot get a good grip on it.It's Itchy. They decided one tag on the outside wasnt enough and added the same tag on the inside as well. The stiching from the tag makes my hand extremely itch. Sure I could probly rip the tag out and solve the problem, but I did not pay 14.99 to have to MacGyver the thing to work well.If you want a single glove for the hand you do not use your mouse with, this may do the job, if you don't mind an itchy hand. But I would honestly suggest looking for another product."
2,Intuit does not stand behind its product anymore,"Having been a Quicken user for many years I upgraded to Quicken 2001 for the internet downloading features. Be very careful if you do this! Although the regular banking seems OK, the investment price history updating puts in the WRONG NUMBERS. Mine even added security prices for the year 2003! All the software support options are charged for at ~$10/query.Intuit has hit on a good way of making money: write a sloppy product, don't test it and charge your customers for finding the problems. Oh, and make yourselves very difficult to contact.Check out the forums on the Quicken web site to get a flavour for what to expect if you are seriously considering a purchase."
3,Good Software but beware if you use Pocket Quicken,"I was upgrading from and older version of Quicken and I found this to have more ways to view your finances. I just use this for my basic accounts and it is very good in keeping me organized. I don't think that they have made any upgrades that I think are useful for the average person.I gave this software three stars because of the problem with synchronizing my pocket quicken. If do some research on landware.com you will see that the 2001 version uses a different method to read new transactions. It tries to match the transaction to an old one. If you don't recognize that it doesn't say ""new"" then the transaction will not be entered. You have to be very carefull when you accept data to your home computer.Overall it is good software but I would rather use the older software for the pocket quicken."
2,G & B 901222A 14-Inch by 20-Foot White Scroll top Flower Border,"A little too flimsy for me. Trying to get it around my garden bed, was a royal pain in the butt. It bent, it wouldn't go in the ground without major adjustments. I was getting so frustrated that I almost through it in the garbage. I will replace this as it also looks very cheap."
5,"fun way to see more patterns,",Quick reference and distraction at work! This makes a great gift for the quilter or wanna be quilter or crafter who's just starting.
4,Phil Woods & Space Jazz Trio,"by Ken DrydenPhil Woods has made many fine recordings for Philology, the Italian label named in his honor, and this one is no exception. He's backed by the Space Jazz Trio, anchored by the fine pianist Enrico Pieranunzi (who wrote nine of the 11 compositions heard here) and also featuring bassist Enzo Pietropaoli (who contributed the two takes of ""Upstairs"") and drummer Alfred Kramer. Woods' potent alto brings out the best in the pianist's strong post-bop charts, especially the driving ""New Lands,"" the lyrical ballad ""Chet,"" and the bittersweet waltz ""Hindsight,"" which features Woods' hypnotic clarinet."
5,very useful,"we have multiple USB powered / charged devices somtimes the devices are so close together that they are hard to plug in side by side, this allows us to plug them in and then move the port (female) end where we need to use it without interfering with anything else going on."
5,The Power Within-Healing through Prayer,Excellent documentary of the power of prayer. They interview credible people and very well done. They cover pertain topics and answer the typical questions people have about prayer. Highly recommend it for personal viewing and for discussion among friends. A video for local libraries.
4,Gasket set for B16A2,The quality of the gaskets in this set is top notch but i only found myself using 1 so far; Namely the oil pan gasket.The removal of the gasket from the original pan was a Pain in the A$$. I don't know if it was originally bonded or if the person i bought the car from had it superglued but it was sure on there. I spent a whole day with some razor blades to get that thing off.Other gaskets include:oil pan drain plug washerdipstick tube O-ring2 O-ring cam sealsOil pump inlet tubeOil pump sealRear Main sealWater pump mountingWater pump mounting O-ringCrank SealGood quality set if you need all these items replaced
2,Magic Flute,I purchased these for y childcare center - I thought they were larger than they actually are (at least the ones I received). Basically they are a circle harmonic (tiny) and the kids were not interested in them at all!
3,Excellent cookbook,"Excellent Belgian cookbook. Details recipes from all over Belgium, dividing them on a regional basis. No pictures, but the recipes themselves speak volumes. There are quite a few recipes using game which may not appeal to everyone. This is a more complete look at Belgian cuisine rather than the very good 'Everyone eats well in Belgium', which concerns itself with Flemish cuisine.I would definately recommend this cookbook."
4,"Nice,easy listening!","Nice, easy listening from Nicholas Gunn. Although, I think the Sacred Fire is stll his best work to date. Return to Grand Canyon does have it's moments. The latin flavor is a nice spice that takes this work from being standard to above average! Govi's guitar work on Horseshoe Mesa is a treat and the vocals by Peter Marmentini on the Greatest Wonder are strong and inspiring. I had to get a translation of the lyrics from a neighbor, it would have been nice of they would of appeared in the jacket. A nice listen for an easy afternoon!"
4,I can see,"I ordered this mirror, thinking it swiveled from regular to magnified. Well, it is only magnified, but I am still happy with it. For those of us who must wear reading glasses (even if they are just the ""cheaters"" you buy in the store), putting on make-up can be a challenge! This mirror allows me to actually see what I am doing, instead of guessing."
5,A Must-Have For Those Who Seek Knowledge,"A) Every single song on this album is beautiful.B) For those who need to sekkle and grow, songs like ""Sitting and Watching"" and ""Wolves and Leopards"" are teachings set to music."
2,Only good if you plan ahead,"If you plan on buying this pouch, I would suggest that you plan ahead. The major drawback to this is you cannot pack the extra lenses or the battery charger. The good side of this pouch is that it's nice to bring along if you plan on just having fun with the Coolpix 880. You can whip out your camera from this pouch, snap a few pics, and then place it back. This isn't a major purchace decision (I mean come on, this is only a fraction of what the camera itself costs) so you might as well purchase this, but then again this isn't the most innovative product either."
2,check tamrac digital series,"i too purchased the 880 case and was disappointed when it arrived. it didn't have the space i needed for additional batteries perhaps even a charger for extended periods. i wasn't looking for a suitcase or anything but it fits the camera nicely. i found that the tamrac digital series from camera hut or shack or whatever had a whole line of 'digital aware' cases that would fit any size camera and goodies. you're welcome for the plug, corporate but i don't work for ya!"
3,Don't trust the picture,This shock what exactly what it claimed to be but when it showed up it was silver not the pictured white. Not a functional problem but the person I was installing it for was not happy. It was going on a '68 mustang that was being resorted and the other side is white.
2,Sqeaky Shocks,I was very happy the first day and by the second day both shocks started to squeak. So now I have two new shocks and they will squeak for years...
4,Preview,"A Shadow of Suspicion - ""Julie, I suspect the poisoned needle was meant for you,"" Victor said.I blanched. My legs weakened beneath me. Victor's grip on my shoulders tightened, and he pulled me against the length of his body, holding me in a tight embrace. He cradled my head against his chest with one hand, and I could hear his heartbeat. My own heart picked up the cadence.""Once you saved my life,"" he said. ""I would hate to think I have put your life in peril by bringing you to Windbrace. I pray to God I am wrong."" He kissed me on the forehead, then held me at arm's length. ""Lock your door when I leave,"" he said.I leaned against the door after I had locked it, savoring the feel of being in his arms . . ."
5,Folk and Acoustic Guitar Fan,"I am a fan of any acoustic string instrument and David's guitar does not disappoint me here. He is not afraid to play around a little and does so regularly but when he needs to get down to business the technique is there. He has a wonderful humor in his voice that comes through in many songs. I love the simple styling of ""Down to Eugene"" but also the more complex word play of ""American Family"". It's a wonderful CD that should please any fan of folk or earthy acoustic guitar."
4,The Underappreciated David Gans,"What a treat to have David Gans' solo work available on CD! I don't know which I like better -- the original tunes like ""River and Drown"" or the covers. My favorites are David's take on ""Black Peter"" and Martin Mull's ""Normal,"" an ode to married life that I think might make a great wedding song for a really twisted couple. I have had ""Shut Up and Listen"" stuck in my head for weeks -- tune by Gans, lyrics by Robert Hunter. Good stuff.He's great live too. Check it out."
1,Too Bad there was no 0 Star Option,"This man is a crank!! Thomas would have been hard pressed to write a worse book than the one he did on the Mossad but this dog easily surpasses his earlier work in bad writing, terrible research and altogether inanity. Once again Thomas spins fantastic tales that are impossible to prove. I mean please, the CIA using a gyroscope to induce mental illness, who would believe such nonsense, except maybe Thomas. Then the part about the Chinese teaching the Israelis to make bio-weapons, I mean hello, I think bio-tech in Israel is little more advanced then in China. At best this book is a bad work of fiction, where were the editors? Save your money, this book belongs on the rack alongside the UFO and Bigfoot books; then again that sells those books short. This book is in a class all by itself. REALLY BAD!"
5,Seeds of Fire:China And The Story Behind The Attack On Ameri,"Seeds is your beacon in the darkness of government disinformation and secrecy. Thomas has done an amazing job to get the truth to you and me...all of us... and it shoulod be required reading. You'll learn what the media will not publish. You'll learn that the media is managed and you are fed only what they want you to have. Seeds is your passport to truth, no matter how grim it gets. You need to read it and pass it on. Get the truth out to your family, your friends and neighbors."
1,frenetic storytelling,"Imagine if the ""Crocodile Hunter"" host on Animal Planet drank about 5 double espressos and then tried to tell a childrens story. Fast and furious, this tape was a terrible waste of money. Enunciation was poor and he even managed to make ""The Three Little Pigs"" annoying and unenjoyable for my child and I both."
3,Unexciting B-sides,"If you're going to buy this at an inflated import price, please be aware that the B-sides are just not up to the standard of the brilliant ""Less Than Zero""."
2,Not as good as 'SPLENDID UK',"The single for review doesnt have much of a punch, it sounds a bit of an odd choice for a radio single. SPLENDID from the UK have a much more gutsy sound with songs that have more of an immediate impact than 'Less than Zero', Check out soundclips from 'splendid uk'at CD Baby"
2,Did not work.,"I hate to put a bad review on a product. But this one cost me headache. I read a few reviews before buying it but it still did not work for me. I tried splitting 3 videos and it did, but the video image would skip every 2 seconds. Maybe it was me. The good thing is that amazon refunded me the full amount."
5,I'm loving this final chapter of Cardcaptor Sakura,"I've enjoyed the third season of Cardcaptor Sakura the most. Whereas the first two seasons can be bogged down with the formulaic capture of the cards, I find the third seasons plays out better because relationships intesnify and the emotional impact is so much greater! This volume definitely heightens the drama as feelings are revealed all the while the threat of Eriol continues to intesnsify. Sakura's magic is growing ever stronger as time passes; she also comes closer to discovering Eriol's machinations! Definitely building to the climax of the series in this volume. This is a great series. I highly recommend it!"
5,Perfect in every way,This carseat was a blessing when my 5 month old grew out of her infant carrier/carseat. I needed something that was rear-facing do to the fact she was still under 30 lbs.and 1 year. I searched the stores and online for 2 weeeks until I came across the Graco Comfort Sport Convertable Carseat. It has very soft cushioning and fabric. Very easy to install. Easy removal of the cover for cleaning. No need to unlatch the carseat.And best of all it is for infants up to 30 lbs.(recommended) and forward-facing for children 30 to 40lbs. All in all I love the carseat and it is very inexpensive!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Just ""Okay""",I bought this seat for my 10 month old. It is great until he falls asleep. His poor little head is nearly touching his belly. It definately does not recline enough. I'm hoping this seat will be much better forward facing. I will try rolling a towel under the seat to have it recline a bit.
4,We are on our 2nd,We had purchased this or a seat simular for our 2 1/2 year old daughter when she was 8 months old. With our 2nd daughter we were looking to get a new car seat. I researched and went from store to store comparing car seats. I found that nothing compared--in convenience and price. After looking at higher priced $250 seats and other middle priced seats. I still come back to the Graco.
4,"Newly purchased, seems ok so far","We just purchased this car seat for our 8 month old daughter because we need the convenience of two car seats for our two cars. While reading the instructions, I did see they suggest using a towel to adjust and stabilize the seat while rear facing - I thought it was a bit hokey, but one towel did the trick. Also the plastic panel that folds under the seat for rear-facing was a pain to lower, but it makes all the difference in the recline. It just goes up again when the seat needs to be put forard-facing. She seems to like it ok so far, but I agree about the straps. I noticed she tends to slip a bit to one side, despite the straps being snug, and one shoulder seems to be looser than the other."
3,Disappointed,"I agree with the previous review. The seat does not recline enough in the rear-facing position and maybe I don't know what I am doing but the shoulder strap would not stay up on one side. I had her in the middle of the seat and the belts couldn't really be much tighter. I really liked the look of the seat and it seems to be pretty ""cushy"". Unfortunately I am going back to the store to try again."
5,BEEN AROUND THE WORLD!,This carseat is fairly light compared to others yet still comfortable for my daughter. we have driven from So.California to San Fran (9 hour drive) no problem. I have taken it to and from England ALONE with my daughter and i'm thankful its not that heavy and fairly easy to install in an airplane seat.and its about $40 cheaper then the first car seat we bought and returned . really like this model.
2,Not Safe for Smart Babies,"I bought this seat for my eleven month old twins, and was moderately happy with it. I knew it didn't recline enough rear facing, but I liked Graco products and figured I could deal with it for a month.Well, a month goes by, and it was much better forward facing. Only one problem, my 12 month old daughter can undo the chest clip while riding. While I know all children won't figure this out before they will start listening to their parents, this is still a terrible feature. What's easy for adults is too easy for children."
5,The best from the ABC years.,"From 1972-78, the Four Tops were signed to ABC Records. 14 of their best tracks from this period are included here and all boast superb sound quality. ""Are You Man Enough?"", ""Midnight Flower"", ""Sweet Tender Love"", ""Keeper of The Castle"", ""Catfish"" and the timeless ""Ain't No Woman (like the one I got)"" were among their best songs from the 1970s. The Four Tops' second golden era certainly gave them more hits."
2,NOT ESSENTIAL,"The images were mildly interesting but the photography was only average. The best image was the one on the cover, which does convey the dynamics of the spherical movements. The written content was slight. It was worth one look and then went onto the shelf. I doubt I will open it again. I'm still looking for something that captures the remarkable grace of this powerful form of self-defense."
3,An enjoyable evening,"I spent an enjoyable evening with Terry's words and the accompanying pictures. I'd hesitate to call it a book about aikido. I'd call it a memoir by an aikidoka.The vignettes that are presented are well-done, and a number gave me pause to reflect on them.The photography used a too-slow shutter speed for my taste, most of the time. It conveyed the motion that is essential to aikido, but it often resulted in being just a blur on the page."
5,I love this book.,"It is amazing how brilliantly the photographs have been matched with the stories. The photographs are mesmerizing, the stories compelling. This would be a wonderful addition to any library."
2,"Ok, but not what I expected","I guess I didn't do my research. I really should have read the other reviews. I was under the mistaken impression that this book was some kind of cohesive biography. It's really just a group of thoughts, short stories(2 pages at most), and other disconnected accounts. Most pages that have text consist of a single paragraph with the facing page having a picture.The book is extremely short with a multitude of pictures(some faces you will recognize) filling up half the book.This reminds me more of a coffee table book. Perhaps that was what was intended.I am rating this book according to how I enjoyed it. You may have a different experience."
2,Not even 2 months old and falling apart.,"I bought these boots not even two months ago and three out of the four lace hooks on the right boot have pulled out. I work on my feet 50 hours a week on a concrete floor, they are comfortable but when I bought a pair of Wolverine boots I really expected more."
2,"Looked good, but...","Looked good, price was OK, but I ordered extra wide, and it still didn't fit. I can order extra wide from other brands, and get a shoe that fits just fine. But if I want to shell out a little extra for some quality, I get this crap. I had to ship it back, and pay for it as well."
2,Disappointing,"I purchased these boots in March of 2011. Within a week of receiving them I pulled out two of the lace hooks on the left boot. Since it would be quicker, I took them to a local shoe repair and got new hooks. I wear them every day walking on grass and gravel. But other than wearing them daily, I am not hard on them. They do get damp regularly walking through grass covered in dew. But here I am a year later and I find that the glue holding the left shoe upper to the sole has come loose. Even if I can reglue them, these shoes have only a short life left. Very disappointed in Wolverine."
4,Wolverine Harrison Boots,"Having had a pair of Harrison's for over 15 years(most comfortable pair of boots I've ever owned), I decided to shell out for another pair and take a chance. Overall I am happy. The only cons are that the new boots no longer have insets on the tongue to run your laces thru, which definitely helped with fit, and I dont believe the soles will last quite as long as the durashocks on the original pair. Like everything else it seems the tongue's are of a thinner leather than they used to be and the boots themselves dont seem to keep my feet quite as warm as the old pair and may also be thinner leather. Overall tho for the price I paid (80 bucks) its a pretty unbeatable pair of boots. Dont hesitate to buy."
4,Great separation,"A prior poster said that there was no indication that this was audio only. I agree that it is confusing only because people have confused the V in DVD with video instead of versatile. DVD-Video and DVD-Audio are two different formats best played on two different players.When looking at a DVD selection you need to note whether it is listed as DVD Audio or not.Oh, and DVD Audio discs can have video as well. The video can only be seen if you have a DVD-Audio player. DVD-Video players, ironically, cannot get at this portion of a disc.(DVD-Audio is a higher quality sound recording compared to traditional compact discs. It sends 6 channels of information to the sound processor rather than the older stereo {2} channels.)I hope this helps people understand the difference and why this is listed under DVD... I'm of the opinion that this should be moved under music, and the category labelled as DVD be changed to Video."
5,fun for adults as well as for kids...,"Reminiscent of that band that you loved in college, only now your kids can listen along, too! (And it is an even better feeling singing your heart out with your kids with the windows rolled down of your too-big-SUV as opposed to that hoopdie you drove back then, anyways--) Justin Roberts seems to capture kid trials, tribulations and triumphs magnificently--and is able to keep parents smiling, dancing and singing along as well. For every age from 3 days to 300! We love it and think it is his best yet!"
3,"Very cute, but not my personal fave","Nice job Justin Roberts - cute CD (but I like the They Might Be Giants kids CDs much better... can't articulate why, just do)."
4,"Good, fun music","This is a great kids' album. It has fun, simple music that will appeal to most younger kids and their parents. It's not another karaoke-ish version of Old MacDonald, eesh. We have kids from 3-10 and our whole family likes it."
4,Great for kids!,"We play this CD at Lakeshore (a children's store) all the time and it's very catchy. The music is upbeat, pleasant and fun to listen to. So far kids and parents alike love this music. And of course, it's educational."
5,GREAT,"Fun, creative, funny lyrics, great music! My kids love the songs, and personally, I often listen to this cd myself in the car even without the kids."
4,Great Book!!!!,"I managed to see a pre-publication copy of the Web Library & I highly reccommend it to any/all web searchers. Very exhaustive, complete, insightful & witty to boot. Believe the sub-title. Nick Tomauolo has done an amazing job of finding all of the free web sources known to man & organizing them in a cohesive, coherent manner. It's actually a joy to read (not some dry, dusty tome). You can indeed build your own ""million dollar library"" for free- and never leave your house. Just buy this excellent book & start building- and have a darn good time doing so."
4,One of the Good Guides,"Great little book, wish I had wrote it myself. All kinds of stuff & it's all free. Kinda makes you wonder how the author found the time to track it all down, but he did. Well organized, can't say much else. Just buy this one & use it over & over again."
1,It goes back tomorrow,I tried to use it today and have a non-level shelf as a result. It gives a different angle when you reverse it or turn it over. Very inaccurate.
2,""" Cheap""heat.","Product works ok,but the second time I started to use it the switch fell apart and stopped working.Therefore I had to purchase and install a new switch. A little inconvenient."
4,Buy IT!!!!!,She has an amazing voice that will captivate your soul. I have seen her perform and it will blow your mind. Her voice as well as stage performance will keep you out of your seat! This is one album that people will have to buy!!!
5,Fabulous!,"This CD rocks! I love Catherine's music. It's fresh, original and captures your heart immediately. My favorite tracks are Free Bird, Ink on the Skin and Rescue Me. Every track has something unique to offer. All in all, it's a really great CD."
2,Sorry I Bought This One,"Live and learn I guess. Don't get me wrong, this unit is powerful and the electric ran smooth. But there is no reason this thing should be so loud. I have to put plywood in front of it to deflect the sound. Tecumseh could have put a better and bigger muffler on this engine. They tested this motor when they made it, so they didn't realize it was so loud. Or did they decide to save a few bucks by installing an undersized ineffective muffler? As a builder, I start early and have many complaints from neighbors calling village halls about the noise. I even tried calling Tecumseh to see if this thing could be modified to make it quieter. Plus there is no excuse for the cheap plastic oil stick that come with this. The plummer I use has a Coleman Powermate with the same 10 hp Tecumseh motor with the cheap plastic oil stick. Same noise problem. So I can't blame Porter Cable other than their poor choice of using the Tecusmeh engine in this generator."
1,Lives up to half par,"I am completely dissatisfied with this product. Before purchasing, I phoned PorterCable and specifically asked if this generator would run both my compressor( rated by the manufacturer at 3,200 surge watts(2,475)and my circular saw.I did this on more than one occassion, knowing how frequently unknowledgeable staff give false answers. I was assured it would. No such luck once I owned it. It won't run the compressor, even with the valve open, under no pressure. No help from PorterCable. I have since tried friends' and co-workers generators rated at less than this model's 5000 watts and/or 6875 surge and they will run the compressor all day. PorterCable now tells me only half, yes only half of the wattage is available to 120 volts, the full load to 240 volts. And I'm stuck with it."
1,Total Disappointment!,Buying this cd I expected a lot more! Like different songs! Every song sounds exactly the same and the girl's voice makes you want to scream (migraine!).
4,Dance Hall Crashers crash mainstream...,"I am not usually a big fan of vintage ska rock, but I love the Dance Hall Crashers. Their unique sound crosses music genres and pulls fans from all over! A primarily ""spunky-sounding"" band, the Crashers are a nice alternative from the angst rock pouring out of modern radio, but a more musically serious band than the manufactured ""pop sensations"" society has been force-fed. With an upbeat sound and crazy lyrics, the Dance Hall Crashers are proof that music can be fun and talented at the same time."
2,"Easy listening, NOT ambient","Trite lyrics, cloying vocals and uninspired arrangements surf for a lowest common denominator. The result is saccharin, at best. Too upfront to be ambient but too unengaged to be trance, this is Celt-influenced easy listening music."
4,Pleasingly Pleasurable,"Wasn't disappointed with this one at all. Recommend it for ""your"" NEW AGE collection."
1,Does not look like picture.,I was excited to recieve this item. In the picture it looks like a dark blue very soft sleeper with footies. I recieved this item and it looks nothing like the picture. It is a medium blue outfit that resembles long johns and it does not have the enclosed feet. It is not worth $16.99. I think it is horrible how they advertise a completely different outfit then the one you recieve. They need to change the picture on their website. The picture is a huge misrepresentation of the actual product.
2,Disappointed,"I was informed that this product had belt clip, but it doesn't and it's hard to carry and keep up with."
1,CROOKED SELLER,"I ATTEMPTED TO PURCHASE THIS ITEM AND ACCORDING MY ORDERS IT WAS IN STOCK AND WOULD SHIP OUT IMMEDIATELY. HOWEVER, A WEEK AND A HALF WENT BY AND WHEN FINALLY I ASKED WHEN IT WOULD ARRIVE, I GOT A MESSAGE IN REPLY STATING IT WAS NO LONGER AVAILABLE THEY CANCELLED MY ORDER. NOW I LOOK IT UP HERE ON THIS PAGE AND FIND IT NOT ONLY AVAILABLE BUT AT TWICE THE PRICE!!!! THE SHIPPING COST WAS JUST AS MUCH WHEN ORIGINALLY ORDERED IT!! $7.50 FOR THE ITEM AND $7.50 FOR THE SHIPPING....NOW IT IS $14 BEFORE SHIPPING. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ORDERING THESE FROM A SELLER WHO WILL CANCEL YOUR ORDER AND THEN DOUBLE THE PRICE."
1,"Does what you want, with ease... Then Breaks!","UPDATE: 12/14/01The below review was done soon after hooking up the Netgear. Since then I've had nothing but trouble (read my latest review).----------------------I've got 3 computers. It took 5 minutes to get the Netgear out of the box, hooked to my cable modem, and all 3 computers hooked to the box and running on my new local network! It uses a web interface which was very easy.Further, it understands that some cable modem providers are trying to limit you to one computer -- the setup screen automatically asks if you want to spoof you MAC address to ensure you can have multiple computers behind your new firewall.Opening ports for Web and FTP servers, as well as Netmeeting, etc. was also very easy. (Make sure you upgrade the firmware to 3.22, mine shipped with 3.20, which doesn't have as many features via the Web interface).Excellent!Cheers,BilFish"
3,"Works well, but for a limited time","I've had my RT314 since 2000, and it worked pretty well 90% of the time. It ran in dynamic IP mode (with a near static IP from BellSouth). I also ran mail and web servers behind it for personal use. One time in 2001 I needed to upgrade the firmware because it was losing it's connection with my modem and not resetting.But this month (January 2004) the router finally gave out. The router needs to be rebooted every half hour or so to work. I can't even pull up the telnet interface after about 30 minutes. After checking most of my network, I replaced the router and everything's back to normal. So if you're not running any servers on your high speed connection and get this router for cheap, I'd recommend it to work for you for about 4 years."
4,Works as advertised,"My girlfriend uses the Netgear RT314 along w/ a DSL modem to share our connection to the Internet. She gave our computers unique, non-routable IP addresses (192.168.0.x range), and the RT314 got the address that was assigned by our ISP. The RT314 sits between our network and the Internet. She said this unit is very easy to configure, maintain, and includes a simple default firewall."
1,"bad product, worst customer service","I bought two routers from netgear so far. The first one lasted for about 6 months and started to fail. I called the customer service. But all they want to do is to avoid replacing the router. At the end, they tricked me saying "" there might be thunderstorm/lighting before it went bad"". That's is it, it's not covered under warranty anymore...The second one I bought is the wireless router, and it went dead in a couple of hours. This time all the customer service can say is to send it back... fortunately I can return to the store I got it from.So no more netgear for me."
4,Pretty decent all around...,"This unit was fairly eay to install and set-up (I had a couple of difficulties with conflicting IPs on a pre-existing home network, but these were fairly easily resolved). Can't beat the price, and it has a pretty good feature set."
5,Great Tech Tool,If you have Cable or DSL you must get one of these. This Router has been wonderful for us. I am an IT guy but you don't have to be to set one of these up. Follow the directions that come with the product and away you go.
5,This Box Rocks,"One word to describe it, Fast. Set-up took about 10 minutes from the box to the internet. I have cable internet thru @home, and although they told me and others that these boxes don't work on cable, I knew it would. I haven't played with the advanced configuration yet, so i can't rate that part. But over all I would recomend this for quick and easy cable/DSL internet sharing."
2,There has to be something better,"After reading all the reviews about this and Netgear, I bought this and 2 network cards. I guess I expected to much.First, you still need a cable modem or a DSL modem if you use this. That was my first mistake. I expected it to have a connection for a cable modem. It doesn't.Second, I expected good documentation. The documentation that it comes with is very sparse and has almost nothing useful.Third, support.... After waiting on the phone for over 2 hours and hearing ringing then music again, over and over again, I finally gave up hoping that someone would pick up the phone.Anyway, during that time, I figured out what I need to make this thing work. It still took the better part of the morning for such a simple thing. I still don't know how to get the DHCP to work nor do I know how to change the admin name or password. Then again, that is not anywhere in the documentation either.I guess I can rule out buying anything else from Netgear in the future."
5,Buy this router!,"It just works. It took me 5 minutes to setup and I haven't had a problem since (more than a month). The speed is every bit as good as a direct connect to the cable modem itself. Just plug in, change your PC to DHCP addressing on the TCP/IP properties, reboot your computer, launch your browser (no proxy server), and type in [the required info] and your set.Also, remember, you can now share drives on the other PC's connected to the router. Attaching is simple if you know the machine name or assigned IP address. Find out your assigned IP address by running WINIPCFG from your Run command if you are on Win 98. It's IPCONFIG from a DOS prompt in Windows NT or 2000.I can go on... but trust me, for the cost of this unit, it cannot be beat. Oh, one other thing, turn off your firewall software. With NAT, you don't have to worry about getting hacked on your side of the router."
1,Useless,"I tried to help a friend configure this router for their home but failed. It had the easiest configuration screens I had ever seen for setting up but we could never get it to work and I've done several routers of different brands in the past with no problems. I tried calling Netgear tech support and was on hold for 30 min till I gave up. Web site gave sample config settings for the local cable service which I had inputed but still did not work. Also, the 314 has no off switch, and no master reset switch. My advice: get another brand."
1,Watch out for Netgear!,"Netgear must be the worst technical support ever! When you call Netgear, their voice audio is so low, You can't hear them. I thought they hang up on me. The reason I called Netgear is that I couldn't install my router. I finally hear them, I ask how to install this router, they ask what model? I said RT314. Netgear said this to me, the router is too old. So, I wasted a hour on the phone. Worst than that, they have bad english. If you buy a Netgear router, but don't buy this model. Buy a Trendnet router. The Trendnet router took me less than 30 mins to install. So, I could use the Computer, ps2, Wii, DS, and etc. In the end, stay away from Netgear!Trust me!"
